Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:13,731
There's simply no way to shield
against every weaponized agent.

3
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:15,650
Instead, I can make
super-immune systems...

4
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,319
by strengthening
the human cellular response.

5
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,237
Banner, I know
where you're going.

6
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,364
But manipulating the immune system
is dangerous and stupid.

7
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:26,201
The president's science advisors
made it absolutely clear...

8
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:29,162
no human subjects.

9
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:52,308
David, I have wonderful news.

10
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:57,271
I'm gonna have a baby.

11
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:36,779
What's it gonna be?  Whoa, look at that,
Bruce. Huh?  Want a dinosaur?

12
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:39,240
Let's have a little fight.

13
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:41,575
You don't scare me.

14
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:46,663
That's a delicious eyeball.  Ooh, you're big
and green and scary.  I'm gonna run away.

15
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,647
Really, speaking of Cheryl,
guess what...

16
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,607
Bruce, you're hurt!

17
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:20,694
Jack hit him with the stick,
but Bruce wouldn't hit him back.

18
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:23,197
He just stood there, shaking.

19
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,198
It's okay.

20
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,790
Yeah, strange
he didn't make a peep.

21
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:36,208
Any other kid
would've wailed his head off.

22
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:37,835
That's Bruce. He's like that.

23
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:40,379
He's just so... bottled up.

24
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:47,302
The samples we found in your lab...
they were human blood.

25
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:49,220
You've ignored protocol.

26
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:51,890
You had no right
snooping around in my lab.

27
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:53,850
That's my business.

28
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:57,728
Wrong, Banner.  It's government business,
and you're off the project.

29
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,667
Attention, all personnel.
Fail-safe has been initiated.

30
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,253
Gamma decontamination
will occur in 30 minutes!

31
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,921
Evacuate immediately!

32
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:28,214
I repeat, evacuate immediately!

33
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,526
- Edith?
- David, what's going on?

34
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:52,654
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

35
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:56,574
What are you doing?

36
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,188
What are you doing?

37
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:33,066
I'm trying to tell you
what has to be done!

38
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,484
David, please stop it!
No!

39
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,366
No! No!
Yes!

40
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,785
David! No!

41
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:53,376
Bruce.

42
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,336
Bruce, wake up, son.

43
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:58,255
Bruce. Bruce.

44
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,844
Another nightmare?

45
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,304
I don't know.

46
00:10:06,346 --> 00:10:08,390
I don't remember.

47
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:11,768
Hi, Mom.

48
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:15,938
Already off to college.

49
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,857
Gonna miss you terribly.

50
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:19,775
I'll miss you too.

51
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,777
Please, come here.

52
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:25,530
Look at you.

53
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:28,575
Soon to be a great scientist.

54
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,368
I guess.

55
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:32,328
- I mean, who knows?
- I do.

56
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,415
There's something inside you...
so special.

57
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,293
Some kind of greatness.

58
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:41,378
I'm sure someday you're gonna...

59
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,755
share it with the whole world.

60
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,139
But as far as I'm concerned,
security oughta be...

61
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:41,058
Good morning, Dr. Krenzler.

62
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,853
Security oughta be beefed up.  In a
place like this you can't be too careful

63
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:47,105
Bruce!  Big day.

64
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,024
- Did you sleep?  I didn't sleep.
- I slept okay.

65
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:52,360
- Is Betty here?
- She's around.

66
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:55,446
I really gotta say, seeing you
in that stylin' head wear...

67
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,616
You're implying something
about my helmet?

68
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:01,577
You look like a massive nerd,
even around other scientists.

69
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:05,747
Can I just ask... Were you wearing
the helmet while she dumped you?

70
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:08,124
See, it protects my very
important brain, Harper.

71
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,210
Go prep the samples.

72
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,505
- Hey. I found you.
- Betty, hey.

73
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,760
I hate them.

74
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:22,012
-Wait, I just got here.  Who do we hate?
-The review board.

75
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:24,890
We have to make a
presentation on Tuesday.

76
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,975
And you're gonna make it with me.

77
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:29,102
You think I should?

78
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:31,521
Yeah, you're great with that stuff.

79
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:36,525
You start talking about microbes and
nanomeds, you sound almost... passionate

80
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,946
I'm sorry.

81
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:42,990
That was rude.

82
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,409
Look, nobody expects this
to be easy,

83
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,578
us working together
after being... so close.

84
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,497
We were close?

85
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,832
Look, if I could be more...

86
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,585
whatever, you know...

87
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,754
- I'm... just...
- Don't.

88
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:01,090
It's not your fault, really.

89
00:13:01,173 --> 00:13:03,008
You're just a by-product...

90
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:05,927
of my inexplicable obsession
with emotionally distant men.

91
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:07,929
I'll get over us.

92
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,807
Good for you.

93
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:13,684
Anyway, I'm just really stressed
about this review.

94
00:13:13,768 --> 00:13:17,730
If we don't get impressive results today,
we're gonna have a really hard sell come Tuesday.

95
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,941
Well, then, let's go be impressive.

96
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:04,940
Harper?

97
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:07,734
Ready when you are.
Let's hit it.

98
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:14,198
Are we passing inspection?

99
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:16,575
Safeties all going green.

100
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:18,536
Countdown's started.

101
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,457
Nanomeds released.

102
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:27,335
Four seconds.

103
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,924
Okay, nanomeds fully dispersed.

104
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:38,053
Okay, let's hit Freddie
with the gamma radiation.

105
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:52,442
Gamma exposure.

106
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,112
Nanomeds now active.

107
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,784
Nanomeds replicating cells on border.

108
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,745
It's working.

109
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:11,834
Cell copy to disassemble ratio
holding within one percent.

110
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:21,427
Imbalanced nanomed activity.

111
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:35,565
You wanna go to the review board
on Monday and tell 'em...

112
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:38,484
we've developed a brand-new
method for exploding frogs?

113
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:41,695
Yeah, I think maybe
there's a market for it.

114
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,989
I mean, what if there's a plague?

115
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:46,616
What have you had, Betty,
like, one beer?

116
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,536
I'm just sa...
I'm just saying, you know,

117
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:51,955
frogs start falling from the sky,

118
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:54,207
who do they come to?

119
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:56,167
We'd be world-renowned.

120
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,335
Make any parents proud.

121
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:01,338
I bet they would be.

122
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:04,258
They actually did
want me to be a scientist.

123
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:07,302
I mean, your birth parents.

124
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,847
Guess we'll never know.

125
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,602
I don't understand why you don't
want to find out about them.

126
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:19,980
They're dead.  They died before
I can remember anything.

127
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,774
Why do you always
come back to this?

128
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,027
Don't know.

129
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,280
I guess I figure there's more
to you than you like to show.

130
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,282
I guess there couldn't be any less

131
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,328
Right. So now we come
full circle back to that.

132
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,288
Nice work, Betty.

133
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,010
Betty.

134
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:54,679
- Glen.
- Hey.

135
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,639
Hi.

136
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,641
Hi.

137
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,102
What happened
to your uniform?

138
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:04,271
Oh, I, uh...
I switched over.

139
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:06,648
I'm still working with your father, but...

140
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,193
Well, you know, the military's subcontracting
out all the most interesting work, and...

141
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,571
Can't argue with a paycheck.

142
00:17:13,654 --> 00:17:16,449
I basically run
all the labs on the base now.

143
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:18,367
Oh.

144
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:22,037
Hey, you're uh...

145
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:24,039
you're looking good.

146
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:31,921
You're the genetics expert.

147
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,517
Ah, the good old college days.

148
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,770
So, how's business?

149
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:52,565
What do you want?

150
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,944
All right, I'll cut to the chase.

151
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:59,822
I've been hearing interesting things
about what you guys are doing here

152
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:03,617
Your little molecular machines
have some incredible implications.

153
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:06,536
How would you like to
come work for Atheon?

154
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,414
Get paid 10 times as much
as you earn now...

155
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:12,083
and own a piece of the patents.

156
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,753
You just have to say the word.

157
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:17,755
Two words: The door.

158
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,065
General?

159
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,192
Come in.

160
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:43,737
Talbot wanted you to see this, sir.

161
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,616
It's about a lab Atheon is targeting for
acquisition and removal to desert base

162
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,910
Why isn't it
going through N.S.C.?

163
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:56,082
It, uh, concerns
your daughter, sir.

164
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:05,924
Hi. Sorry.

165
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:11,596
Hey, what happened to Benny?  Is he
not working the night shift anymore?

166
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,556
Benny's dead.

167
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:15,766
I'm the new guy.

168
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,768
Oh.

169
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:21,271
Good to meet you.
Same.

170
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,628
- Let's try another.

171
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:49,381
Mmm, no. Stay here.

172
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,466
I look tired anyway.

173
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,634
Yeah, but you look great.

174
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:58,055
What's the matter?

175
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,557
It's these dreams, Doctor.

176
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:03,769
I keep having them,
and they're terrible.

177
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,397
Tell me about your dream.

178
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:12,277
Well, it starts...

179
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,488
it starts with a memory...
I think it's my first memory.

180
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:18,449
It's this image I have...

181
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:21,201
from when I was
maybe two years old.

182
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:53,981
Do you think
it's just a dream?

183
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:56,233
No, I think it's something
that happened...

184
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:59,195
when I was living at a desert base
with my father.

185
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:02,072
Anyhow,

186
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:04,491
the dream goes on and...

187
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,326
suddenly I'm alone.

188
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:42,234
That's terrible.

189
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:44,611
You know I'd never hurt you.

190
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:20,602
Hey there.

191
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:23,605
What's your name, darlin'?

192
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:26,399
Eh? What's your name?

193
00:22:27,108 --> 00:22:29,444
Okay.

194
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,446
It's okay.

195
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,336
I gotta talk to you, Edith.

196
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,422
Bruce, stay here!

197
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:41,245
"C... T... G...

198
00:25:41,328 --> 00:25:44,414
A... G."

199
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,418
Bruce.

200
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,217
My Bruce.

201
00:26:05,308 --> 00:26:07,644
Good morning.
Glen dropped by.

202
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:09,562
What's he doing here?

203
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:11,272
You know, Dr. Krenzler,

204
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:14,192
you and I have never had the chance
to get to know each other properly.

205
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:18,112
Well, that's because I don't want to get
to know you, properly or improperly.

206
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:21,990
So leave.

207
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:23,951
Hey, no worries.

208
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:34,043
Let me give you a little heads-up.

209
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:37,421
There is a hairsbreadth
between friendly offer...

210
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:39,298
and hostile takeover.

211
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:43,176
I've done my homework.  The work
you're doing here is dynamite.

212
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,054
Think: Gls embedded with technology...

213
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:48,515
that makes them instantly
repairable on the battlefield...

214
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:50,600
in our sole possession.

215
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,020
That's a hell of a business.

216
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:57,773
Well, it's not what we're doing here.
We're doing the basic science for everyone

217
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:02,194
You know, someday
I'm gonna write a book...

218
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:07,032
and I'm gonna call it When Stupid Ideals
Happen To Smart, Penniless Scientists.

219
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:10,994
In the meantime, Bruce,
you will be hearing from me.

220
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:34,515
About Glen, I, um...

221
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,143
There's nothing to talk about.

222
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:41,271
Okay.

223
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:45,150
I just wanted to say, don't worry
about him... I'll handle it.

224
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:49,362
How?

225
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:52,365
I'm gonna call my father,

226
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:55,368
ask him to exert some pressure.

227
00:27:55,451 --> 00:27:58,662
Last I heard, you and your father
weren't speaking.

228
00:27:58,662 --> 00:28:00,581
Hmm.

229
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,499
Well...

230
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:05,085
I guess now I have something
to talk with him about.

231
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:07,420
I think this circuit's kinda fried.

232
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:10,256
I don't know.  Maybe you
anna come take a look at it

233
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:12,550
Okay, I'll be right there.

234
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:21,683
Aah!

235
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:41,201
The gamma's too high!
Bruce, I can't stop it!

236
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:45,747
Harper, get out!

237
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:48,375
Get out!

238
00:29:13,106 --> 00:29:14,941
How's Harper?

239
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:16,859
He's all right.

240
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:18,777
You saved him.

241
00:29:18,861 --> 00:29:22,656
I don't think he's coming back
to the lab for a while, though.

242
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:30,121
I don't understand
how this is possible.

243
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:32,999
You should be dead.

244
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:38,462
They worked... the nanomeds.

245
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:40,464
I mean, I feel great.

246
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:43,884
I feel like... I don't know.
They must have, like, fixed me.

247
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:47,345
Bruce, they've killed everything else
that they've come into contact with.

248
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:51,516
Are you sure
the doctor checked?

249
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:53,434
The doctor gave me
the full workup.

250
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,603
He wants to know where
he can get what I'm taking.

251
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:57,563
I'm a hundred percent.

252
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,482
More.

253
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,776
What do you mean?

254
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,695
Remember my bad knee?

255
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:07,030
Well, now it's my good knee.

256
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:09,491
Bruce, this isn't funny.

257
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,492
I was watching you.

258
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:16,831
You were gonna die,
and I was gonna have to watch you die.

259
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:19,416
Betty...

260
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,460
I'm sorry.

261
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:25,547
Really.

262
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,091
Hey, I'm not gonna explode.
Okay?

263
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:30,969
Yeah.

264
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,013
You should get some rest.

265
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:36,015
And I'm fine. Really.

266
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:39,226
I've never felt better.

267
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:42,117
Your name is not Krenzler.

268
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:44,369
It's Banner.

269
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,500
- What?
- Your name...

270
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:51,201
it's Banner.

271
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:52,902
Bruce Banner.

272
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,755
Bruce.

273
00:31:57,256 --> 00:31:59,800
How did you get in here?
I work here now.

274
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:02,553
In the labs.
The late shift.

275
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,389
It keeps me close to you.

276
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:10,602
You always work so late yourself
with your friend Miss Ross.

277
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:13,855
No, no. Please. Please.
Let me.

278
00:32:17,316 --> 00:32:19,360
You're not well.

279
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:22,070
You've had a terrible accident.

280
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:26,992
You're wondering
why you're still alive.

281
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,996
You're thinking
there's something inside.

282
00:32:32,955 --> 00:32:35,291
Something different...

283
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:38,919
inexplicable.

284
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:43,173
I can help you understand,

285
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:45,175
if you'll let me.

286
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,720
If you'll...

287
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:51,639
forgive me.

288
00:32:55,351 --> 00:32:59,980
Look, mister, I'm sure I have
nothing to forgive you for.

289
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,275
So perhaps you should leave now.

290
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:05,193
I'll be fine.

291
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:07,112
You must know.

292
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,322
You may not want to believe it,

293
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:12,909
but I can see it in your eyes.

294
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,454
So much like your mother's.

295
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:20,124
Of course,
you're my flesh and blood.

296
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,127
But then, you're something else too,
aren't you?

297
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,379
My physical son,

298
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,883
but the child of my mind too.

299
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,801
No.

300
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,719
You're lying.

301
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,597
My parents died
when I was a small boy.

302
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,975
No, no, that's not true.
That's what they wanted you to believe.

303
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:43,145
The experiments, the accident...
all top secret.

304
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:46,148
They put me away for 30 years.

305
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:48,525
Thirty years!

306
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:51,611
Away from you.

307
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,571
Away from our work.

308
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,615
But they couldn't keep me forever.

309
00:33:56,615 --> 00:33:59,285
After all, I'm sane.
They had to admit it.

310
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:03,372
You see,

311
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:05,332
everything...

312
00:34:05,415 --> 00:34:07,626
your extraordinary mind...

313
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:10,545
has been seeking all these years...

314
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:13,005
it's been inside you.

315
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:16,133
Now we will understand it.

316
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:18,552
We will harness it.

317
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:22,681
No, don't answer it.
It's Miss Ross again.

318
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:27,018
There's something you need to know
about her, Bruce. Something troublesome

319
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,562
Let me protect you from her.

320
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:32,106
No. Get out.

321
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,442
- Bruce...
- Get out!

322
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:36,361
Sit!

323
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:56,253
We're gonna have to
watch that temper of yours.

324
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:35,998
You sure you're okay?

325
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:37,958
Yeah, just glad to be out of bed

326
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:41,628
Got a message from my father.

327
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:43,547
He's coming to see me.

328
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,465
Your father?

329
00:35:45,549 --> 00:35:47,133
When?

330
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:49,094
Lands in about an hour.

331
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:52,889
The funny thing is, he called me.

332
00:36:03,315 --> 00:36:06,318
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, Betty.

333
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:17,495
- Here, ma'am.
- Thanks.

334
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:18,954
- You're welcome.  Sir?
- Thank you.

335
00:36:19,038 --> 00:36:20,331
You're welcome.

336
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:31,966
Look, I'm gonna get right to it.

337
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,051
It's about Glen, isn't it?

338
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:38,305
He's been snooping around my lab.

339
00:36:38,389 --> 00:36:40,224
Glen noticed some things,

340
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:43,018
asked me to make some inquiries.

341
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,480
Are you here to...

342
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,440
question me?

343
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:49,983
No.

344
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:52,735
We've turned up
some surprising things.

345
00:36:55,154 --> 00:36:57,364
This Krenzler you work with...

346
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,908
you know who he really is?

347
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,829
How much do you
actually know about him?

348
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,706
I think the question is,

349
00:37:06,706 --> 00:37:09,417
what is it
that you know about him?

350
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:16,382
- Well, right now, I'm not...
- Not at liberty to disclose it to me. Right

351
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:19,468
You know,

352
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,429
I think I was hoping that...

353
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:25,057
maybe this time you just...

354
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:28,393
honestly wanted to see me again.

355
00:37:28,435 --> 00:37:30,937
- You've got this all wrong, Betty.
- Do I?

356
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,774
Yes. I do want to see you.

357
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:40,029
I really wishthat I
could believe you.

358
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,530
Everything...

359
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:30,950
your extraordinary mind
has been seeking...

360
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:33,244
all these years,

361
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:35,913
it's been inside you.

362
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:55,890
Hi, you've called Dr. Krenzler.

363
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:58,851
Please leave a message
and I'll call you right back.

364
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:03,647
Bruce, hey. Are you there?

365
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,066
Look, um,
I think I screwed up.

366
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:10,528
My father... It's like he suspects
you of something. I don't know.

367
00:39:10,612 --> 00:39:13,573
- I was so impatient, like always.

368
00:39:13,656 --> 00:39:16,409
I didn't hear him out.
I don't know, l...

369
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,787
I just think that they're planning
something with the lab.

370
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,497
So, um, uh...

371
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,332
Call me. Okay?

372
00:39:23,415 --> 00:39:25,167
Bye.

373
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:28,211
- Betty?

374
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,174
Dispatch! Dispatch!
We have a 415 at the lab!

375
00:41:04,257 --> 00:41:06,510
Send Berkeley P.D. Now!
Send 'em now!

376
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:34,619
Watch out!

377
00:42:36,884 --> 00:42:39,136
Edith?

378
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:41,055
David, what's going on?

379
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:44,182
- I gotta talk to you, Edith.
- Bruce, stay here.

380
00:43:15,044 --> 00:43:17,129
My Bruce.

381
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:32,602
Bruce?

382
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:09,844
There was some sort of explosion.

383
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:12,305
They wouldn't let us
into the building.

384
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:15,975
I was worried about you.

385
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:18,435
Well, I'm okay.

386
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,147
What happened to you last night?

387
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,026
I had the most vivid dream.

388
00:44:27,277 --> 00:44:30,071
It was like being born.

389
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:32,740
Coming up for air.
Light hitting my face.

390
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:34,742
Screaming.

391
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:38,037
My heartbeat...

392
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,539
it was, like, boom...

393
00:44:40,622 --> 00:44:42,499
boom...

394
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:47,087
boom.

395
00:44:52,091 --> 00:44:53,968
Were you at the lab?

396
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,928
No.

397
00:44:57,221 --> 00:44:59,139
But something...

398
00:45:01,475 --> 00:45:03,310
And there was that man.

399
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:05,228
The one with the dogs.

400
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:07,188
Who?

401
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:11,150
That new janitor.

402
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:13,403
He said he was my father.

403
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:20,409
I'll get it.

404
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,128
My father.

405
00:45:41,345 --> 00:45:43,347
My, my.

406
00:45:43,388 --> 00:45:45,557
So this is the young Bruce Ban...

407
00:45:47,684 --> 00:45:50,019
Krenzler.

408
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:55,316
I think you left something
in your lab last night.

409
00:45:57,318 --> 00:45:58,986
Mitchell.

410
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:01,738
Escort my daughter outside.
I'll join her shortly.

411
00:46:03,365 --> 00:46:05,117
I'd rather stay here.

412
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,577
Now, Betty.

413
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,747
It's okay.

414
00:46:10,788 --> 00:46:12,665
I'll be fine.

415
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:25,677
Keep him under observation.
I'll be back.

416
00:46:32,767 --> 00:46:35,686
- What?
- Your friend in there.

417
00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:39,315
There's a good chance he's caught
up in some very bad business.

418
00:46:39,398 --> 00:46:41,233
Unfinished business.

419
00:46:41,316 --> 00:46:44,277
And I promise you, I'm gonna
get to the bottom of it.

420
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:47,155
You have my word
I'll make sure he's cared for.

421
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:50,033
But as of right now,
he is incommunicado.

422
00:46:50,116 --> 00:46:52,410
And for the next
few days at least,

423
00:46:52,493 --> 00:46:54,287
you're gonna stay away from here.

424
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:56,288
For your own good.

425
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:07,882
Okay, and that's for the new guy
on the night shift, right?

426
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:10,802
Great. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

427
00:47:27,484 --> 00:47:29,402
Dr. Ross.

428
00:47:29,444 --> 00:47:32,280
How unexpected.

429
00:47:32,363 --> 00:47:34,282
Please come in.

430
00:47:39,411 --> 00:47:42,873
I'm sorry to just show up
at your house like this.

431
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:44,916
Uh...

432
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,088
I came to ask you something that...

433
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:53,758
I really have no business asking

434
00:47:55,259 --> 00:47:57,595
He told you?

435
00:47:57,678 --> 00:47:59,597
He said you talked to him.

436
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,557
Oh.

437
00:48:01,598 --> 00:48:03,517
Please sit down.

438
00:48:11,566 --> 00:48:15,236
Bruce was at the lab last night.
He said that you were there too.

439
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:18,072
But he can't remember much about it

440
00:48:18,155 --> 00:48:20,240
I need to find out what happened.

441
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:22,201
So, you want to know, uh,

442
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:24,202
what's wrong with him...

443
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,122
so you can fix him?

444
00:48:27,247 --> 00:48:29,499
Cure him, change him.

445
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,753
My father's with the military.

446
00:48:33,836 --> 00:48:36,630
He seems to think he's involved in
some kind of threat to national security

447
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:38,549
Mmm.

448
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:41,844
Your father. Ross.

449
00:48:42,844 --> 00:48:46,515
You brought your father
down upon his head?

450
00:48:46,598 --> 00:48:49,476
How little you understand,
Miss Ross,

451
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:53,229
and how dangerous
your ignorance has become.

452
00:48:54,855 --> 00:48:57,024
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

453
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:59,068
My son is...

454
00:49:00,444 --> 00:49:02,321
unique.

455
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:04,239
That's why you can't relate to him.

456
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:08,743
And because he is unique, the world
will not tolerate his existence.

457
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:10,662
Will they?

458
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:13,664
But you...

459
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:16,917
you try,

460
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:18,836
don't you?

461
00:49:18,878 --> 00:49:20,838
Yes.

462
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:29,179
And a very beautiful
woman like you,

463
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:31,889
your attentions...

464
00:49:31,973 --> 00:49:35,518
can't be completely unwanted.

465
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:37,895
Can they?

466
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:41,356
No.

467
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:44,735
Not with eyes like yours,

468
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:47,570
watching expectantly,

469
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:50,573
lovingly.

470
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:55,786
But I'm afraid
we're both too late to help him.

471
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,997
There's nothing
I can do for him...

472
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,082
or for you.

473
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,084
Besides,

474
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:05,879
he's made it clear he wants
nothing to do with me.

475
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,797
His choice.

476
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:11,551
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Ross,
I have some work to do.

477
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,720
And don't worry about the dogs.

478
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,639
You'll be fine.

479
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,141
Just don't look 'em in the eyes.

480
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,395
Good-bye.

481
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,650
He gets released, and a month later
your lab is destroyed.

482
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:30,527
What a coincidence.

483
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,446
So you're not gonna tell me
where he is, are ya?

484
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:36,615
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'd like to help you, but I just don't know

485
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:38,909
You know who I am.
Right, Banner?

486
00:50:38,993 --> 00:50:41,662
- Your Betty's father.
You're a high-ranking general.
- Let's cut the crap.

487
00:50:41,787 --> 00:50:45,373
I'm the guy who had your father
tossed away, and a lot more like him,

488
00:50:45,415 --> 00:50:48,926
and I'll do the same with you if I
feel so disposed. You understand?

489
00:50:49,067 --> 00:50:51,337
If you had him tossed away,
then why are you asking me?

490
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:55,299
I don't remember.
I was always told my father was dead.

491
00:50:55,383 --> 00:50:57,218
Don't play with me!

492
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:59,637
You were four years old
when you saw it.

493
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,055
When I saw what?

494
00:51:02,097 --> 00:51:05,767
You were right there.  How could
anyone forget a thing like that?

495
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:08,770
What?

496
00:51:08,853 --> 00:51:11,731
Oh, some more repressed memories.

497
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:16,610
Just tell me.

498
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,657
I'm sorry, son.

499
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:26,036
You're an even more screwed-up mess
than I thought you'd be.

500
00:51:26,995 --> 00:51:29,372
Until we get
to the bottom of this,

501
00:51:29,414 --> 00:51:32,291
your lab has been declared
a top-secret military site...

502
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:35,628
and you're not gonna get
a security clearance to get back into it...

503
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:38,547
or any other lab that's doing
anything more interesting than...

504
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:41,967
trying to figure out
the next generation of herbal hair gel.

505
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:47,389
One more thing.

506
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:49,349
If you ever...

507
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:53,853
come within a thousand yards
of my daughter again,

508
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:56,981
I'll put you away for the
rest of your natural life.

509
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:12,537
Dogs!

510
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:17,333
Go! Go get her!

511
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:20,294
And let nothing stand in your way!

512
00:52:20,336 --> 00:52:22,546
Go!

513
00:53:24,061 --> 00:53:25,896
Hello?

514
00:53:26,021 --> 00:53:27,814
Bruce?

515
00:53:27,897 --> 00:53:31,734
So, they think they can just
throw you away as they did me.

516
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,244
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?

517
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:44,162
I got a visit today.

518
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:46,540
A very unwelcome visit.

519
00:53:46,581 --> 00:53:49,042
I'm afraid my hand is being forced

520
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,170
What did you do to me?

521
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:55,047
You so much want to know, don't you?

522
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:59,134
But I think no explanation
will serve you half as well...

523
00:53:59,176 --> 00:54:01,637
as the experience.

524
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,308
In any case, I still don't
quite understand it myself.

525
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:09,227
If they'd only let me
work in peace...

526
00:54:09,227 --> 00:54:12,271
Of course, my betters
would have none of that.

527
00:54:12,355 --> 00:54:15,149
So you experimented
on yourself, didn't you?

528
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:18,736
And passed on to me... what?

529
00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:21,280
An alteration. Genetic.

530
00:54:21,363 --> 00:54:25,450
A deformity.
I guess you could call it that.

531
00:54:25,534 --> 00:54:27,994
But an amazing strength too.

532
00:54:28,078 --> 00:54:30,914
And now, finally unleashed,
I can harvest it.

533
00:54:30,997 --> 00:54:32,790
No.

534
00:54:32,874 --> 00:54:34,709
You'll do no such thing.

535
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:37,169
I will isolate it
and treat it myself.

536
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:40,506
I'll remove it and I'll kill it
before it does any real harm.

537
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:43,300
I'll bet you and your Betty
would love to destroy it.

538
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:46,469
But would you really
destroy part of yourself?

539
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,973
I don't think so.

540
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:51,891
And as for Betty,

541
00:54:51,975 --> 00:54:53,893
I'm sending her a surprise visit...

542
00:54:53,935 --> 00:54:56,270
from some four-legged
friends of mine.

543
00:54:56,354 --> 00:55:00,649
You see, I managed to culture
some of your very own DNA, Bruce,

544
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:03,318
and the results are tremendous.

545
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,988
They're unstable, but very powerful.

546
00:55:08,365 --> 00:55:10,450
What about my DNA?

547
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:14,412
Let's just wait and see what Betty
makes of the results, huh?

548
00:55:14,495 --> 00:55:16,330
No. You're crazy.

549
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:18,290
I won't let you.

550
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,837
Get your hands off of me.
Talbot, what's this...

551
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,089
Inside, asshole.
I wanna talk to you.

552
00:55:26,173 --> 00:55:28,008
Listen, my father's
going after Betty...

553
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:31,219
What makes you think you can go behind
my back and get Ross to cut me out, huh?

554
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:34,555
Listen to me!
Betty's in trouble!

555
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:39,643
You pathetic freak.

556
00:55:39,685 --> 00:55:42,020
Betty's in danger.
I swear to you, she'll be killed.

557
00:55:42,062 --> 00:55:43,897
I can state the obvious.

558
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:47,150
Something tells me you aren't in much of a
position to be making stupid threats to anyone

559
00:55:51,904 --> 00:55:53,906
- Talbot.
- Yeah?

560
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,783
You're making me angry.

561
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:58,077
Oh, am I?

562
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,459
Ohh! Oh!

563
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:53,753
I got him! Open fire!

564
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:42,019
Bruce?

565
01:03:55,389 --> 01:03:58,559
He sent these dogs, didn't he?

566
01:03:58,642 --> 01:04:00,936
But I killed them!

567
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,793
My God.

568
01:04:26,876 --> 01:04:29,420
It must be the nanomeds.
It must be the gamma exposure.

569
01:04:29,504 --> 01:04:32,131
But we've never seen
any effect like this before.

570
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,050
No. Deeper.

571
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:37,553
The gamma just unleashed
what was already there.

572
01:04:37,636 --> 01:04:40,055
Unleashed what?

573
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:43,016
Me.

574
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,685
It.

575
01:04:45,769 --> 01:04:48,229
It's okay.

576
01:04:48,313 --> 01:04:49,898
Shh. It's okay.

577
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:54,193
What were those animals?

578
01:04:54,277 --> 01:04:57,113
My father sent them.

579
01:04:57,238 --> 01:04:59,823
He is my father.

580
01:04:59,907 --> 01:05:01,909
He wanted me to change.

581
01:05:01,992 --> 01:05:05,162
He wanted me to change
into that mindless hulk.

582
01:05:05,245 --> 01:05:07,289
Why would he want that?

583
01:05:08,665 --> 01:05:10,833
Can you remember anything?

584
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:14,003
Is there anything
from when you were changed?

585
01:05:16,714 --> 01:05:19,508
It was like a dream.

586
01:05:19,591 --> 01:05:22,344
About what?

587
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:25,597
Rage.

588
01:05:26,973 --> 01:05:28,892
Power.

589
01:05:30,435 --> 01:05:32,770
And freedom.

590
01:05:49,911 --> 01:05:53,081
Hello? Sir.

591
01:05:54,457 --> 01:05:56,375
- Hello.
- Dad?

592
01:05:56,417 --> 01:05:58,711
Betty! Are you all right?

593
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:04,299
I'm scared.
I need your help.

594
01:06:04,383 --> 01:06:06,301
Where are you?

595
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,520
How are you?

596
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:21,148
Okay, I guess.

597
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:26,903
I think that somehow...

598
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:30,156
your anger is triggering
the nanomeds.

599
01:06:30,156 --> 01:06:34,410
How could it?  We designed them
to respond to physical damage.

600
01:06:34,493 --> 01:06:37,455
Emotional damage
can manifest physically.

601
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:40,916
Like what?

602
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:45,921
Serious trauma.

603
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:49,716
Repressed memories.

604
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:59,600
Your father grilled me about something that
happened to me from early childhood...

605
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:01,852
that I'm supposed to remember.

606
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:03,353
He did?

607
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:08,233
It sounded bad,
but... I honestly don't remember.

608
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,696
The thing that worries me...

609
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:15,698
is...

610
01:07:15,781 --> 01:07:17,783
a physical wound is finite,

611
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,702
but with emotions,

612
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:23,413
what's to say it won't
just go on and on...

613
01:07:23,455 --> 01:07:26,875
and start a chain reaction?

614
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,462
You know what scares me the most?

615
01:07:33,297 --> 01:07:35,258
When it happens,

616
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:38,427
when it comes over me...

617
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:41,430
and I totally lose control,

618
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,100
I like it.

619
01:08:01,532 --> 01:08:04,117
It's okay. I got you.
I'm sorry.

620
01:08:04,242 --> 01:08:07,787
You'll be okay.
It's just to make you sleep.

621
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:09,622
Target down.
Target secure.

622
01:08:09,747 --> 01:08:12,417
I'm going to take you someplace safe

623
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,586
Okay? Bruce?

624
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:18,005
Bruce?

625
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,965
Bruce?

626
01:10:47,475 --> 01:10:49,686
Clear!

627
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:01,738
- Attention on deck.
- Carry on.

628
01:11:09,412 --> 01:11:12,081
We're buried out here
in the middle of nowhere.

629
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:14,500
How long are you
gonna keep him sedated?

630
01:11:14,584 --> 01:11:16,710
For the rest of his
natural life, if I have to.

631
01:11:16,752 --> 01:11:19,588
You said I could trust you.
I'm your father.

632
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:23,759
You can trust me to do what I think
is right, not what you think you want

633
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,679
- He is a human being.
- He is also something else.

634
01:11:27,762 --> 01:11:31,182
Suppose he gets out,
has one of his little mood swings...

635
01:11:31,224 --> 01:11:32,558
in a populated area.

636
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:37,104
Yes, I'm aware of the potential danger.
I'm also aware that he saved my life.

637
01:11:37,104 --> 01:11:39,982
Yeah, from a mutant
French poodle.

638
01:11:40,065 --> 01:11:42,234
I'm indebted to him for that.

639
01:11:42,317 --> 01:11:45,695
He also put three men in a hospital,
and Talbot's barely walking!

640
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:49,866
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to help him!

641
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:53,578
- Why is he such a threat to you?
- Because I know what he comes from.

642
01:11:53,703 --> 01:11:57,665
He is his father's son,
every last molecule of him.

643
01:11:57,706 --> 01:12:00,167
He says he doesn't know his father

644
01:12:00,209 --> 01:12:05,422
but he's workin'in the same
exact goddamn field his father did.

645
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:09,634
So either he's lyin'...
or it's somethin' worse, and he's...

646
01:12:09,676 --> 01:12:11,636
What?

647
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:15,348
Predestined to follow
in his father's footsteps?

648
01:12:16,724 --> 01:12:19,560
I was gonna say "damned."

649
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:22,062
Of course you were.

650
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,480
But I'm a scientist.

651
01:12:23,563 --> 01:12:27,901
As a scientist, I believe we can figure
this out and he can be helped.

652
01:12:27,942 --> 01:12:31,154
I know you do.

653
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:34,532
Look, whether you know or care,

654
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:37,993
I've got a lot of pride
in what you've done.

655
01:12:38,077 --> 01:12:40,954
But this is too big for you.

656
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:44,833
Look, I know the government thinks
they have a weapon on their hands.

657
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:47,419
Otherwise, he'd be dead by now.

658
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,754
They can probe and prod
all they want,

659
01:12:49,838 --> 01:12:52,006
and in the meanwhile,
just let me try to help him.

660
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:55,301
Nobody knows him better than I do

661
01:12:58,053 --> 01:13:00,764
What did David Banner do to him?

662
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:06,353
Cover left!
Clear left.

663
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:08,271
Cover right!

664
01:15:13,594 --> 01:15:16,389
What's happening here?

665
01:15:16,389 --> 01:15:18,849
My hand.

666
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:24,271
You see, the strength
of my son's DNA...

667
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:28,483
combined with nanomed
reconstruction...

668
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:34,697
You see, I can partake
with the essences of all things.

669
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,826
Gonna have to ask you to...

670
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,787
put your hands up, pal, okay?

671
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,123
Nice and easy.

672
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,838
Do you really believe...

673
01:15:51,921 --> 01:15:56,425
that I am separate from you?

674
01:15:56,467 --> 01:15:58,677
Whoa!

675
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:14,734
Where am I?

676
01:16:18,529 --> 01:16:20,406
You're home.

677
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:35,002
It's hard to believe
we used to live here.

678
01:16:37,546 --> 01:16:40,382
I must have seen you or known you.

679
01:16:40,466 --> 01:16:43,176
If only I could remember.

680
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:18,334
This is my old house, isn't it?

681
01:17:55,368 --> 01:17:57,369
Let's go.

682
01:17:59,038 --> 01:18:00,914
Please try.

683
01:18:52,879 --> 01:18:54,880
What is it?

684
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:56,882
Nothing.

685
01:18:56,924 --> 01:18:58,884
Really?

686
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,555
Damn it.

687
01:19:07,976 --> 01:19:11,979
Okay, Betty...
what do you want to know?

688
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:17,776
What was in that room?

689
01:19:28,203 --> 01:19:30,830
What are you afraid that I'll see?

690
01:19:35,835 --> 01:19:39,505
See? There's nothing.

691
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:42,674
It's empty.

692
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,729
What do you mean,
I don't have access to him?

693
01:19:56,771 --> 01:20:01,984
NSA has decided to turn over study
of the, uh... the threat to Atheon.

694
01:20:02,025 --> 01:20:04,444
But you're head of the base.

695
01:20:04,486 --> 01:20:06,863
I thought you were in charge.

696
01:20:06,947 --> 01:20:11,367
But I don't set policy,
and I still take orders.

697
01:20:13,661 --> 01:20:17,456
I can't believe Talbot
would go around me like this!

698
01:20:18,832 --> 01:20:22,336
Oh, there's a lot of powerful people
that want in on this.

699
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:25,589
And money to be made...
lots of it.

700
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:33,471
You know the worst part
about all this?

701
01:20:33,554 --> 01:20:36,474
When I had David Banner locked up
and sent that kid away,

702
01:20:36,557 --> 01:20:40,561
I didn't give that boy a second thought;
he was just collateral damage.

703
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:43,689
Well, he isn't anymore, is he?

704
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:47,776
What can I do?

705
01:20:47,817 --> 01:20:51,195
You can go home now.

706
01:20:53,072 --> 01:20:56,117
I'd tell you to go and say good-bye,
but I've already been informed...

707
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,828
that for now all further contact
is out of the question.

708
01:21:01,121 --> 01:21:02,539
Right.

709
01:21:39,406 --> 01:21:43,702
Hiya, Bruce. How ya feelin'?
Grub okay in here for ya?

710
01:21:43,744 --> 01:21:45,996
What do you want?

711
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:48,331
That's a good question.

712
01:21:48,373 --> 01:21:52,960
See, I need your cells to trigger
some chemical distress signals.

713
01:21:53,002 --> 01:21:56,714
You know, so you can turn
a little green for me again...

714
01:21:56,797 --> 01:21:59,883
and I can carve off
a piece of the real you,

715
01:21:59,967 --> 01:22:02,803
analyze it, patent it,
make a fortune.

716
01:22:04,012 --> 01:22:06,514
Do you mind?

717
01:22:06,598 --> 01:22:08,683
I'll never let you.

718
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:11,227
I'm not sure you've got
much of a choice.

719
01:22:13,646 --> 01:22:16,232
Come on, Bruce.
Aren't you feeling a little angry?

720
01:22:16,315 --> 01:22:20,410
After all, you've only got me to play with now
that Betty's dumped you and gone back to Berkeley

721
01:22:20,652 --> 01:22:22,196
You're lying.

722
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,531
You know, for me
this is a win-win situation.

723
01:22:24,656 --> 01:22:26,908
You turn green, and all these guys
come in and kill you...

724
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,701
and I perform the autopsy.

725
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:31,788
You don't...

726
01:22:31,871 --> 01:22:33,664
And I mop the floor with you...

727
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:36,584
and maybe by accident
go too far and break your neck.

728
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:40,754
Bad science, maybe...
but personally gratifying.

729
01:22:43,048 --> 01:22:46,509
Come on, Bruce!
Let's see what you got.

730
01:22:46,593 --> 01:22:49,053
Never.

731
01:22:54,517 --> 01:22:56,685
You know, consciously
you may control it,

732
01:22:56,769 --> 01:23:00,272
but subconsciously,
I bet that's another story.

733
01:23:29,674 --> 01:23:32,635
All right, let's jump-start
those brain waves.

734
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:45,147
Bruce.

735
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,993
- My dear Miss Ross.

736
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,870
Welcome back.

737
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:04,498
There are two guards
right outside.

738
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:09,502
You don't have to worry.
I'm not angry with you. Not anymore.

739
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,754
What do you want?

740
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,882
It's over for me now.
I know that.

741
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:18,427
And soon it'll be over for Bruce.

742
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:20,846
That's why I've come to you...

743
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:24,975
to ask you if you could
persuade your father,

744
01:24:25,058 --> 01:24:27,686
as a man, as a father himself,

745
01:24:27,769 --> 01:24:32,231
that if I turn myself in now,
peacefully...

746
01:24:32,273 --> 01:24:35,693
and before
he puts me away forever,

747
01:24:35,735 --> 01:24:38,487
that he would let me see my son...

748
01:24:38,571 --> 01:24:41,031
for one last time.

749
01:24:41,073 --> 01:24:43,784
Could you do that for me?

750
01:24:46,203 --> 01:24:48,830
It's out of my father's hands now.

751
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:56,462
I understand.
He's a puppet now.

752
01:24:57,713 --> 01:24:59,923
I don't blame him.
You shouldn't.

753
01:24:59,965 --> 01:25:03,593
You should blame yourself
for what you've done to your son.

754
01:25:03,677 --> 01:25:07,222
And what have I done
to my son, Miss Ross?

755
01:25:07,305 --> 01:25:12,435
Nothing. I tried to improve
on the limits in myself.

756
01:25:12,518 --> 01:25:14,729
Myself! Not him!

757
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:18,232
Can you understand?
To improve on nature.

758
01:25:18,315 --> 01:25:21,151
My nature!
Knowledge of oneself!

759
01:25:21,235 --> 01:25:24,071
It's the only path to the truth...

760
01:25:24,071 --> 01:25:27,991
that give men the power
to go beyond God's boundaries!

761
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:33,162
You know what's beyond
your boundaries? Other people.

762
01:25:33,246 --> 01:25:36,165
All you've given Bruce is fear.

763
01:25:38,417 --> 01:25:41,003
Fear of life.

764
01:25:43,088 --> 01:25:44,923
Fear?

765
01:25:46,299 --> 01:25:48,176
Perhaps, Miss Ross.

766
01:25:50,136 --> 01:25:52,472
And loneliness too.

767
01:25:52,513 --> 01:25:57,143
Yes... I feel them both.

768
01:26:00,521 --> 01:26:05,192
But I have lived...
completely once.

769
01:26:07,402 --> 01:26:09,988
I was so much in love,

770
01:26:10,029 --> 01:26:12,907
and she so much wanted a baby.

771
01:26:12,949 --> 01:26:14,825
My baby.

772
01:26:22,165 --> 01:26:24,918
I could tell
from the moment she conceived...

773
01:26:25,001 --> 01:26:27,879
that it wasn't a son
I had given her...

774
01:26:27,962 --> 01:26:30,131
but something else.

775
01:26:30,215 --> 01:26:32,508
A monster, maybe.

776
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:35,219
I should have put a stop to it
right then,

777
01:26:35,303 --> 01:26:39,556
but I was curious
and that was my downfall.

778
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:43,435
And as I watched this tiny life unfold,

779
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,646
I began to imagine the horror of it,

780
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:50,858
and my curiosity was replaced...

781
01:26:50,942 --> 01:26:53,819
with compassion.

782
01:26:56,072 --> 01:26:58,616
But they took away
my chance to cure him.

783
01:26:58,699 --> 01:27:00,909
Your father threw me out.

784
01:27:00,993 --> 01:27:04,329
- What are you doing?
- I remember that day so well...

785
01:27:04,413 --> 01:27:07,082
every moment, every sensation...

786
01:27:07,165 --> 01:27:09,334
walking into the house,

787
01:27:09,417 --> 01:27:12,503
the feeling of the handle
of the knife in my hand.

788
01:27:12,545 --> 01:27:17,383
I knew I was doing a father's work,
fulfilling a father's mercy.

789
01:27:17,383 --> 01:27:20,344
David, please stop it! No!

790
01:27:20,427 --> 01:27:22,763
David, no!
Talk to me! Listen!

791
01:27:22,846 --> 01:27:25,640
But then she surprised me.

792
01:27:25,682 --> 01:27:29,310
- No! No!

793
01:27:29,394 --> 01:27:31,354
David, no!

794
01:27:31,396 --> 01:27:34,440
It was as if...

795
01:27:34,565 --> 01:27:37,818
she and the knife...

796
01:27:37,902 --> 01:27:40,446
merged.

797
01:27:48,745 --> 01:27:50,830
No!

798
01:27:50,913 --> 01:27:53,499
You cannot imagine...

799
01:27:53,583 --> 01:27:57,044
the unbearable finality of it.

800
01:27:57,128 --> 01:28:00,464
And in that one moment...

801
01:28:00,506 --> 01:28:04,593
I took everything that was dear to me...

802
01:28:04,676 --> 01:28:08,805
and transformed it into nothing more...

803
01:28:08,888 --> 01:28:10,807
than a memory.

804
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:28,782
Bingo! That must be some
jumbo nightmare he just had.

805
01:28:33,244 --> 01:28:35,371
Okay, do it now.
Start the enzyme extraction.

806
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,169
Sir, negative on drill penetration.

807
01:28:42,252 --> 01:28:45,839
Damn it, drill him harder! Give him full RPMs
Come on, Holeman! Come on!

808
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:03,605
-Should I neutralize?
-No, I can't do anything with goop, c'mon on

809
01:29:15,241 --> 01:29:18,285
- All right, put him to sleep.

810
01:29:26,876 --> 01:29:29,045
It's not stopping him!

811
01:29:35,885 --> 01:29:38,262
Ready room, send in
our containment team.

812
01:29:38,345 --> 01:29:40,973
Non-lethals only.
I repeat, non-lethals only.

813
01:29:41,056 --> 01:29:43,183
I must have a sample of him.

814
01:29:43,266 --> 01:29:45,101
Sir!

815
01:29:46,686 --> 01:29:50,064
- Jesus!
- Hit him with the foam.

816
01:29:50,106 --> 01:29:51,941
Deploy containment foam.

817
01:29:52,984 --> 01:29:54,860
Talbot, talk to me.

818
01:29:56,362 --> 01:29:59,656
Under control, General. I'll let
you know if we need you.

819
01:29:59,698 --> 01:30:02,242
Unacceptable.  Unseat your
asses down here immediately.

820
01:30:02,284 --> 01:30:04,327
I want a full-court evacuation now.

821
01:30:04,411 --> 01:30:06,746
I'm shutting you down.
Lockdown.

822
01:30:06,746 --> 01:30:09,457
-Didn't you hear what the general said?
-I said lockdown!

823
01:30:12,043 --> 01:30:14,420
Clear! I need a sample of him!

824
01:30:16,338 --> 01:30:19,550
Take it easy there, buddy.

825
01:30:19,675 --> 01:30:23,303
This might give you
a bit of a sting here, Bruce.

826
01:30:34,939 --> 01:30:38,150
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Clear your weapon! Clear it!

827
01:30:38,234 --> 01:30:41,653
- Give me the M2.
- So long, big boy.

828
01:30:41,737 --> 01:30:44,031
Clear!

829
01:30:53,498 --> 01:30:56,500
Lockdown the entire facility immediately

830
01:31:00,546 --> 01:31:03,423
Target's still moving towards blue level

831
01:31:03,507 --> 01:31:06,635
- Evacuate the main hall.

832
01:31:10,763 --> 01:31:14,267
Send in backup, heavy weapons.
Issue general quarters.

833
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:16,936
Set firing lines left and right!

834
01:31:16,936 --> 01:31:19,563
Heavy weapons, go, go, go!

835
01:31:40,499 --> 01:31:42,584
Contamination, sir.
System readings are redline.

836
01:31:42,626 --> 01:31:44,753
Data's on backup power supply.

837
01:31:51,426 --> 01:31:53,511
Incoming!

838
01:31:59,975 --> 01:32:02,561
-Shut down all power to the main hall
-Sir?

839
01:32:02,603 --> 01:32:07,065
Show him the way out.
We'll fight him outside.

840
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:13,306
Driver, stop.
Driver, stop.

841
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,439
Gunner, traverse left!
Traverse left!

842
01:35:03,352 --> 01:35:05,187
Clear back! Clear back!

843
01:35:57,151 --> 01:36:01,196
Mr. President,
I have some bad news, sir.

844
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,156
Let's have it, General.

845
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:06,284
I've briefed the president on Angry Man.
I assume that's what this is about.

846
01:36:06,326 --> 01:36:10,913
It is, ma'am. I'm requesting
a National Command Authority override.

847
01:36:10,955 --> 01:36:13,666
Angry Man is unsecure.

848
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:17,920
I need everything we have at my disposal
in order to stop his movement.

849
01:36:18,003 --> 01:36:21,381
You're expecting
civilian casualties, General?

850
01:36:21,465 --> 01:36:23,633
Not if I can help it, ma'am.

851
01:36:23,717 --> 01:36:25,844
Consider it done.  Keep us posted.

852
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:14,305
Contact Goodman Control.

853
01:37:14,388 --> 01:37:16,766
Patch data to the assets.

854
01:37:16,849 --> 01:37:19,560
Contact H.Q.

855
01:37:19,601 --> 01:37:23,271
Have them initiate
an immediate evacuation...

856
01:37:23,355 --> 01:37:28,318
in vicinity of grid coordinates
653-216...

857
01:38:01,014 --> 01:38:03,100
Confirm that the area
has been cleared.

858
01:38:03,183 --> 01:38:05,560
Confirm area cleared.

859
01:38:05,602 --> 01:38:08,438
H.Q. Confirms area cleared.
Assets on-line, sir.

860
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,648
Gentlemen, it's time to dig in.

861
01:38:10,732 --> 01:38:14,026
I want this target
stopped in his tracks.

862
01:39:01,612 --> 01:39:03,447
Jesus.

863
01:39:18,002 --> 01:39:21,338
Mayday! Mayday! Ah, shit!

864
01:39:26,968 --> 01:39:30,972
Tango Four is down. Have C-SAR
respond to our 20 ASAP.

865
01:39:31,055 --> 01:39:35,059
We're okay, but, damn it, get him
off us before he tears us apart!

866
01:39:35,142 --> 01:39:37,686
I've got no shot.
Do you have a clear line of fire?

867
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:39,938
Watch it, Tango Flight.

868
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:42,274
Break left! Break left!

869
01:39:42,316 --> 01:39:45,652
Tango Three, pull back and set up
for a Hellfire shot.

870
01:39:45,694 --> 01:39:48,071
Hold your fire till we draw him off.

871
01:39:48,154 --> 01:39:50,323
Tango One is hot. Gun wazzed.

872
01:39:50,406 --> 01:39:52,909
Roger. Going hot. Guns ready.

873
01:39:56,745 --> 01:40:00,707
Engage at will.

874
01:40:19,058 --> 01:40:21,935
Tango One, pull back!
Clear my line!

875
01:40:21,935 --> 01:40:24,813
Tango Flight, clear back.
I've got him painted for Hellfire.

876
01:40:24,855 --> 01:40:29,234
Roger that. Tango One clear.
Take the shot.

877
01:40:46,708 --> 01:40:49,711
Tango One, Tango Three.
I have contact.

878
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:52,130
Holy shit! He's got my missile!

879
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:55,883
Mayday! Mayday!

880
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:01,680
Mayday! Mayday!
We're hit! We're going down!

881
01:41:04,474 --> 01:41:06,726
Give me a head count.

882
01:41:06,768 --> 01:41:09,854
Tango Three, give me a sit rep.

883
01:41:09,938 --> 01:41:13,482
Our kite's busted up,
but we're okay.

884
01:41:13,524 --> 01:41:16,986
Tango Flight, do you have
eyes on the target?

885
01:41:17,027 --> 01:41:20,030
Tango One, I have him in the rocks.

886
01:41:20,072 --> 01:41:23,033
Salvo all. Turn it into a parking lot.

887
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:45,053
T-bolt, your parking lot is ready.

888
01:41:45,053 --> 01:41:47,722
We're bingo for fuel and ammo.
R. T.B.

889
01:42:13,621 --> 01:42:15,706
T-bolt, this is Goodman Control.

890
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:19,293
Be advised, target not destroyed.
He's on the move again.

891
01:42:19,293 --> 01:42:21,170
Damn!

892
01:42:21,211 --> 01:42:23,588
I've got it.

893
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:25,715
It appears he's heading home.

894
01:42:25,799 --> 01:42:27,634
Launch fast movers.

895
01:42:27,717 --> 01:42:31,179
Have them intercept and engage.

896
01:42:31,262 --> 01:42:33,347
Hello?

897
01:42:33,389 --> 01:42:36,892
Betty, Bruce got out.
He's headed your way...

898
01:42:36,976 --> 01:42:38,602
and probably right for you.

899
01:42:38,686 --> 01:42:40,896
How far from the base are you?

900
01:42:40,979 --> 01:42:43,982
I'm already here.
They're taking his father in now.

901
01:42:44,066 --> 01:42:47,652
That's all good news.
Stay there, Betty.

902
01:43:01,039 --> 01:43:03,834
Legend One rolling in hot.
Legend Two breaking offleft.

903
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:07,837
I think I can come back around
for a gun attack.

904
01:43:07,879 --> 01:43:11,049
Acquire a clear target.
Fire at will.

905
01:43:15,261 --> 01:43:18,973
Increase altitude.
Civilian aircraft in vicinity.

906
01:43:22,643 --> 01:43:26,062
Pull up! Pull up!
You're headed for the bridge!

907
01:43:26,146 --> 01:43:30,024
I can't pull up! I can't pull up!

908
01:43:37,865 --> 01:43:41,034
Okay, you've got him now. Take him
on a ride to the top of the world.

909
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:43,912
Let's see what the thin air
will do for him.

910
01:43:43,995 --> 01:43:45,997
Initiating afterburner.

911
01:44:02,804 --> 01:44:04,764
I'm passing flight level 600.

912
01:44:04,848 --> 01:44:06,975
This is out of my envelope.

913
01:44:07,058 --> 01:44:08,935
Hang in there, Legend.

914
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:12,355
I can't maintain.
He's all over my aerodynamics.

915
01:44:12,396 --> 01:44:14,482
He'll lose consciousness before you.

916
01:44:18,027 --> 01:44:23,323
Nine-fifty. I can't hold it.
I'm pulling back!

917
01:45:07,864 --> 01:45:10,241
Puny human.

918
01:45:19,958 --> 01:45:21,835
Contact. He's in the water.
All units, weapons hot.

919
01:45:21,919 --> 01:45:24,171
Let's not take any chances.

920
01:45:24,254 --> 01:45:27,549
You are cleared to fire
on target, Legend.

921
01:45:47,692 --> 01:45:49,652
- Dad?
- Betty?

922
01:45:49,736 --> 01:45:52,071
We don't have a choice.

923
01:45:52,196 --> 01:45:54,407
I have to destroy him.

924
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:58,410
But you can't.  You will only fuel
his rage, and you will make him stronger

925
01:45:58,494 --> 01:46:02,748
It's you he's coming for.
You know that.

926
01:46:03,874 --> 01:46:06,293
Then let me go to him.

927
01:46:06,334 --> 01:46:08,253
Please.

928
01:46:09,671 --> 01:46:12,298
Just give him a chance to calm down

929
01:46:35,778 --> 01:46:39,448
This area has been declared
restricted airspace.

930
01:46:39,531 --> 01:46:43,201
All aircraft are ordered
to clear the airspace immediately.

931
01:47:22,571 --> 01:47:25,073
Echo, One-niner. Weapons are hot.

932
01:47:25,157 --> 01:47:27,575
Target acquired.
Waiting your orders to engage.

933
01:47:27,617 --> 01:47:30,245
Repeat, waiting
your orders to engage.

934
01:47:30,328 --> 01:47:33,539
Command code yellow.
Hold for authorization.

935
01:47:42,631 --> 01:47:44,549
All units, hold your fire.

936
01:47:44,633 --> 01:47:47,844
This is T-bolt to all assets. You have
direct orders to hold your fire.

937
01:47:47,969 --> 01:47:50,346
I repeat, hold your fire.

938
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:52,598
Echo, One-niner. Roger that.

939
01:48:06,152 --> 01:48:08,071
Go go, go, go, go, go!

940
01:48:36,847 --> 01:48:39,683
Hold your fire until my command!

941
01:48:42,144 --> 01:48:44,563
Engine 24 to command.
We are in position now.

942
01:49:49,164 --> 01:49:51,708
You found me.

943
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,753
You weren't that hard to find.

944
01:49:57,254 --> 01:49:59,173
Yes, I was.

945
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:03,857
Let's take a walk.

946
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:37,429
That's the deal, gentlemen.
He stays on this base...

947
01:51:37,513 --> 01:51:41,683
until we get the final word from C-3
on how to dispose of him.

948
01:51:41,725 --> 01:51:46,479
In the meantime, ifhe does
anything but sit there in that chair,

949
01:51:46,563 --> 01:51:51,275
we're gonna turn on the juice
and he'll be incinerated immediately.

950
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:53,653
We've established a
200-yard perimeter, sir.

951
01:51:53,736 --> 01:51:57,823
If we deploy the electromagnetic array,
there should be no collateral damage.

952
01:51:57,907 --> 01:52:00,617
Here they come!

953
01:52:06,456 --> 01:52:08,833
I'm doin' this for you, Betty.

954
01:52:08,917 --> 01:52:12,712
But one way or another, we're
gonna have to prepare for the worst.

955
01:53:57,516 --> 01:53:59,518
I should have killed you.

956
01:54:00,602 --> 01:54:03,105
And I should have killed you.

957
01:54:04,272 --> 01:54:06,524
I wish you had.

958
01:54:11,029 --> 01:54:13,281
I saw her last night.

959
01:54:15,366 --> 01:54:17,701
Saw her face.

960
01:54:17,743 --> 01:54:19,787
Brown hair.

961
01:54:21,496 --> 01:54:23,915
Brown eyes.

962
01:54:23,999 --> 01:54:26,710
She smiled at me.

963
01:54:26,793 --> 01:54:30,338
She reached down and kissed my cheek

964
01:54:31,631 --> 01:54:34,800
I can almost remember a smell.

965
01:54:37,803 --> 01:54:40,681
Almost like desert flowers.

966
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:44,142
Her favorite perfume.

967
01:54:46,853 --> 01:54:50,815
It's my mother,
and I don't even know her name.

968
01:54:58,447 --> 01:55:02,117
It's all right, son.
You go ahead and cry.

969
01:55:08,957 --> 01:55:11,626
Go ahead and cry.

970
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:16,797
Cry. Crying will do you good.

971
01:55:16,922 --> 01:55:19,591
Don't touch me!

972
01:55:20,926 --> 01:55:23,637
Maybe once you were my father,

973
01:55:23,678 --> 01:55:26,306
but you're not now
and you never will be.

974
01:55:26,389 --> 01:55:29,767
Oh, is that so?

975
01:55:29,851 --> 01:55:35,314
Well, I got news for you.
I didn't come here to see you.

976
01:55:35,398 --> 01:55:38,359
I came here to see my son.

977
01:55:39,610 --> 01:55:41,653
My real son.

978
01:55:41,737 --> 01:55:44,156
The one inside of you.

979
01:55:44,197 --> 01:55:48,118
You're nothing but a superficial shell,

980
01:55:48,201 --> 01:55:50,244
a husk of flimsy consciousness...

981
01:55:50,328 --> 01:55:54,081
ready to be torn off
at a moment's notice.

982
01:55:54,123 --> 01:55:57,376
You can think what you like.
I don't care. Just go!

983
01:56:02,714 --> 01:56:06,009
No, son. Listen to me.
I found a cure.

984
01:56:06,092 --> 01:56:08,344
For me.

985
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:11,556
My cells can transform too,

986
01:56:11,556 --> 01:56:14,350
absorb enormous amounts of energy.

987
01:56:14,475 --> 01:56:17,144
But, unlike you, they're unstable.

988
01:56:17,228 --> 01:56:20,355
Son, I need your strength.

989
01:56:20,439 --> 01:56:23,525
I gave you life.

990
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:27,362
Now you must give it back to me!

991
01:56:27,404 --> 01:56:32,408
Only a million times
more radiant, more powerful!

992
01:56:32,492 --> 01:56:35,745
- Stop it.
- Stop? Stop what?

993
01:56:35,828 --> 01:56:38,455
Stop what?

994
01:56:38,539 --> 01:56:42,668
Think about all those men out there
in their uniforms...

995
01:56:42,793 --> 01:56:46,087
barking and swallowing orders,

996
01:56:46,171 --> 01:56:49,424
inflicting their petty rule
over the entire globe!

997
01:56:49,507 --> 01:56:52,593
Think of all the harm they've done!

998
01:56:52,677 --> 01:56:55,554
To you! To me!

999
01:56:55,638 --> 01:56:57,765
To humanity!

1000
01:56:57,890 --> 01:57:00,726
And know this...
that we can make them...

1001
01:57:00,809 --> 01:57:03,311
and their flags and their anthems
and their governments...

1002
01:57:03,353 --> 01:57:05,939
disappear in a flash!

1003
01:57:05,981 --> 01:57:08,066
You in me.

1004
01:57:08,108 --> 01:57:10,276
I'd rather die.

1005
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:14,697
Oh, that's your answer?

1006
01:57:14,780 --> 01:57:18,909
Then indeed you shall die...
and be reborn...

1007
01:57:18,993 --> 01:57:22,245
a hero... of the kind
that walked the earth...

1008
01:57:22,329 --> 01:57:25,916
long before the pale religions
of civilization...

1009
01:57:25,999 --> 01:57:29,085
infected humanity's soul!

1010
01:57:29,169 --> 01:57:32,171
Go!

1011
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:47,894
Stop your bawling,

1012
01:57:47,936 --> 01:57:51,230
you weak little speck
of human trash.

1013
01:57:57,403 --> 01:58:00,239
All right... I'll go!

1014
01:58:01,907 --> 01:58:04,451
- You just watch me go!
- Hit it.

1015
01:58:28,098 --> 01:58:31,059
- Hit it again!

1016
01:58:31,142 --> 01:58:34,770
We can't, sir. There's no power. Some
kind of counter-electromagnetic field.

1017
01:58:39,274 --> 01:58:41,610
Move in and assault the target.
Move in!

1018
01:58:41,693 --> 01:58:44,863
Move, move, move!

1019
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:34,700
Sir, I've located them on radar.
Pear Lake.

1020
01:59:34,784 --> 01:59:37,077
Call up the task force.

1021
01:59:43,458 --> 01:59:45,710
Yes!

1022
02:00:47,517 --> 02:00:50,270
That's right. Keep fighting.

1023
02:00:50,353 --> 02:00:54,690
The more you fight,
the more of you I take.

1024
02:01:01,947 --> 02:01:06,701
Strange. We're reading a phenomenal
drop in temperatures there.

1025
02:01:06,743 --> 02:01:09,162
But simultaneous radiological activity.

1026
02:01:09,287 --> 02:01:12,331
They're absorbing
all the ambient energy.

1027
02:01:21,298 --> 02:01:25,302
Sleep now, Bruce, and forget forever.

1028
02:01:25,343 --> 02:01:30,098
Struggle no more...
and give me all of your power.

1029
02:01:31,849 --> 02:01:35,686
You think you can live with it? Take it!

1030
02:01:35,770 --> 02:01:39,314
Take it all!

1031
02:01:40,941 --> 02:01:44,236
Oh, yes! Yes!

1032
02:01:57,081 --> 02:02:00,334
Take it back!

1033
02:02:00,375 --> 02:02:04,045
It's not stopping!

1034
02:02:04,129 --> 02:02:06,298
Take it back!

1035
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:24,439
Gentlemen... release.

1036
02:02:32,488 --> 02:02:35,366
Gamma charge away.

1037
02:02:55,926 --> 02:02:59,221
- Mwah!
- Sweet dreams.

1038
02:03:50,685 --> 02:03:53,521
- Hello?
- Betty, is that you?

1039
02:03:53,521 --> 02:03:55,981
- Hi, Dad.
- I'm glad I caught you.

1040
02:03:56,065 --> 02:03:58,901
- I'm glad you called.
- Thanks.

1041
02:04:00,486 --> 02:04:04,156
Look, Betty... you and l...

1042
02:04:04,197 --> 02:04:09,202
well, we both know that Bruce
couldn't have survived that blast.

1043
02:04:09,285 --> 02:04:13,247
But... well, you know...

1044
02:04:13,289 --> 02:04:16,167
- What is it?
- Well, you know.

1045
02:04:16,208 --> 02:04:19,628
The usual loonies.  Seein' things.

1046
02:04:19,711 --> 02:04:21,588
Only now everything's green.

1047
02:04:21,630 --> 02:04:25,133
Right.

1048
02:04:25,175 --> 02:04:28,094
Look, uh...

1049
02:04:28,136 --> 02:04:31,597
if by some chance
he did survive...

1050
02:04:31,681 --> 02:04:36,102
and he should try to contact you,
try to get in touch,

1051
02:04:36,185 --> 02:04:38,687
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

1052
02:04:39,813 --> 02:04:43,483
No... I wouldn't.

1053
02:04:43,525 --> 02:04:47,028
But you know as well as I do,
I wouldn't have to.

1054
02:04:47,112 --> 02:04:50,448
I mean, my phones are bugged,
my computer's tapped.

1055
02:04:50,531 --> 02:04:52,617
I'm under surveillance.

1056
02:04:54,702 --> 02:04:57,288
I'll tell you, though,

1057
02:04:57,329 --> 02:04:59,331
that if he were alive,

1058
02:04:59,373 --> 02:05:02,417
I'm the last person
I would want him to come to...

1059
02:05:02,501 --> 02:05:05,754
because... as much as I miss him,

1060
02:05:05,879 --> 02:05:09,757
I... I... loved him.

1061
02:05:09,799 --> 02:05:12,718
I, um...

1062
02:05:12,802 --> 02:05:16,013
Yeah.

1063
02:05:16,055 --> 02:05:18,307
I'm sorry, Betty.

1064
02:05:20,559 --> 02:05:23,061
I am so sorry.

1065
02:05:25,272 --> 02:05:27,399
I know you are.

1066
02:06:02,306 --> 02:06:04,141
Si.

1067
02:06:14,859 --> 02:06:18,445
Let's take a walk.

1068
02:08:22,309 --> 02:08:25,520
<i># You operate and motivate
on synthetic fuel</i>

1069
