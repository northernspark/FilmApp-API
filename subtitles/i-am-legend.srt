00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:52,582
Here's Karen at the health desk.

3
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,177
The world of medicine, has
seen its share of miracle cures.

4
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:58,985
From the Polio vaccine,
to hearth transplants.

5
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:01,759
But all pass achievements may pale

6
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,052
in comparison to the work
of doctor Alice Kripin.

7
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,522
Thanks you so much for joining
us this morning. - Not at all.

8
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,699
Doctor Kripin, give it
to me in a nut shell.

9
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:14,040
Well, the premise is quite simple.

10
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:16,591
Take something designed by nature

11
00:01:16,592 --> 00:01:20,721
and reprogram it, to make it work
for the body rather than against it.

12
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:25,022
You're talking about a virus?
-Indeed, yes in this case the measles.

13
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:27,856
Virus, which has been
engineered at genetic level,

14
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,214
to be helpful rather than harmful.

15
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,811
I'll find a best way to describe it.

16
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:36,553
If you can imagine
your body as a highway,

17
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,387
and you picture the
virus as a very fast car,

18
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:41,815
being driven by a very bad man.

19
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:44,578
Imagine the damage that car could cause.

20
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,422
But then if you replace
that man with a cop

21
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:51,428
the picture changes, and that's
essentially what we've done.

22
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:53,439
How many people have you treated so far?

23
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:57,513
We've had ten thousand and nine
clinical trials on humans so far.

24
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:01,166
And how many are cancer
free? -Ten thousand and nine.

25
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,878
So you have actually cured cancer?

26
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,381
Yes, yes.

27
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:08,966
Yes, we have.

28
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,964
Three years later.

29
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:02,587
What did you see, what did you see?

30
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:48,017
Damn.

31
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,207
Let's go Sam.

32
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,226
Come on.

35
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:08,420
Disgusting.

36
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:11,119
Excuse me, excuse me.

37
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:15,718
All right, c'mon relax.

38
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,816
Here you go.

39
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:59,263
Eat your vegetables. Don't just push
them around. Eat them, I am not playing

40
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:06,512
OK. You're gonna eat your vegetables.
I'm gonna sit down here all night.

41
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:14,111
What are you whining about? Why
didn't you just eat your vegetables?

42
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,260
Alright, here's a deal.

43
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:21,559
Look, you're gonna eat twice as
many vegetables tomorrow night.

44
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,100
Alright?

45
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:24,258
Deal? Deal?

46
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,306
That feels good.

47
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,256
Argh, Sam!

48
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,839
Robert, what is happening? I've been trying to reach
you on the cell, i just keep getting a recording.

49
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,706
Daddy, where are we going?

50
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,838
Can't get used to the new rags.

51
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:12,688
We are going to aunt
Sarah's. What? No! Why?

52
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,888
Just strap yourself in, go.

53
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:17,037
Alright, 30 minutes colonel. Copy.

54
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:22,137
30 minutes to what?
They are sealing off the island.

55
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:31,787
Seal off the island? This island?
-But I don't wanna go to aunt Sarah's

56
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,286
Did you bring on the money?
-Yeah.

57
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:35,236
How much? 
-600 dollars.

58
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,535
Why did you say "you're" going? 
-That's not enough.

59
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:40,134
Robert, you said that
you're going not we're going.

60
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,234
All right, when you get across, I need you to
get to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can get.

61
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:48,483
Take Sarah's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

62
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:51,584
Bring enough food for two weeks.
-Jesus Robert, did it jump?

63
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:57,032
Is it airborne?
-But we only go to aunt
Sarah's in the summer.

64
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:18,648

65
00:13:57,232 --> 00:13:58,882
It may be. 
-Ow, my God.

66
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:03,282
Its Christmas. What about my presents?
-He's announcing it.

67
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:27,590

68
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:04,081
<i>Make no mistake, my fellow Americans...</i>

69
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:06,881
-We've left my Christmas presents in the closet.
-This mutating virus is a lethal enemy.

70
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:09,131
Hush Marley!

<i>...so it is with great sadness
but even greater resolve...</i>

signed an executive order</i>

76
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:27,078
<i>initiating a military
quarantine of New York City.</i>

77
00:14:27,478 --> 00:14:29,578
God be with us.

78
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:38,426
The window is still open.
We find something in a week or two
weeks,

79
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:41,377
We... can reverse the spread.

80
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,326
I can still fix this.

81
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:53,974
Please , you can do the
same work outside the city.

82
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:58,625
This is ground zero.
This is my site. We talked about this.

83
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,873
What are you doing?

84
00:15:03,473 --> 00:15:05,524
What am I doing?

85
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:08,773
I'm not gonna let this happen. 

86
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,373
-Let?
This isn't up to you, you can't...

87
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,421
How did you sleep?

88
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,366
C'mon, you know better than that.

89
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,167

Sam, c'mon we have to go.

151
00:30:49,204 --> 00:30:51,303
Sam, what are you doing?

152
00:31:03,802 --> 00:31:05,901

Sam, go, go! Get out!

Gotta pay attention, ok?

155
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:19,343
Gotta pay attention.

156
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:25,041
Listen, uh...
I want you to stay here on this one, ok?

157
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:29,941
Because you can still get infected.

158
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:33,690
And i can't.

159
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:53,038
So look, if I'm not back by dark,

160
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:58,938
just go.

161
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:34,874
Ok. Subject is female,
likely 18 to 20 years of age.

162
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:38,776
Sedative only sedates effectively
at six times the human dose.

163
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:43,524
Core temperature 106 Fahrenheit,
pulse 200 epm.

164
00:34:43,724 --> 00:34:47,774
Respiration elevated, PAO2,
300 percent of normal.

165
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:57,573
Pupils fully dilated.

166
00:34:57,672 --> 00:34:59,422
Non reactive to light.

167
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:13,671
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

168
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:18,870
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.

169
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,568
Vaccine test GA series,
serum 391 compound 6.

170
00:35:29,118 --> 00:35:31,368
Commencing human trials.

171
00:35:55,115 --> 00:36:00,964
Respiration slowing.
Pulse 190, core temperature

172
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:06,513
105, 104 and decreasing.

173
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:10,962
We may have something here.

174
00:36:56,858 --> 00:37:02,607
GA series serum 391 compound 6,
ineffective on humans.

175
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:25,204
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

176
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:28,252
Still no cure.

177
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:50,700
Day 1001. We came in close contact
with a hive today.

178
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,150
Blood tests confirm that i remain immune
to both the airborne and contact strings

179
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,599
to both the airborne
and contact strings.

180
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:01,848
Canidae remains immune
to airborne string only.

181
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:07,298
You can't go running into the dark, dummy.

182
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:15,948
Vaccine trials continue.
I am still unable to transfer
my immunity to infected hosts.

183
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:20,645
Cripton virus is...
...elegant.

184
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:29,445
Just fishing in the dark, son.

185
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:35,694
Behavioral note.

186
00:38:37,995 --> 00:38:41,444
An infected male exposed
himself to sunlight today.

187
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:50,642
Its possible, decreased brain function

188
00:37:57,254 --> 00:38:00,499
or growing scarcity of
food, is causing them to

189
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:56,741
ignore their basic survival instincts.

190
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:03,040
Social devolution appears complete.

191
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:08,542
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

192
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:17,638
Why are we stopping?

193
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,188
Bridge's closed, folks.

194
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,088
You've got less than 10 minutes.

195
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:33,787
C'mon baby, lets go , lets go. -Daddy.

196
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:39,586
It's alright, c'mon.

197
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:41,586
Mommy they have guns, 

198
00:39:41,987 --> 00:39:43,236
-Its ok,
they in the army like daddy.

199
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:47,328
Make a hole, 

200
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,627
make a hole. Coming trough.

201
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,726
You're clear. Move ahead.

202
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:05,726
Clear.

203
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:12,375
Step up. You're clear. Next.

204
00:41:13,225 --> 00:41:15,074
Let's go. No good.

205
00:41:18,524 --> 00:41:19,825
Clear. -Look, Look. Clear.

206
00:41:19,874 --> 00:41:20,724
Good, move on.

207
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,522
But..., no..., Robert, Robert!

208
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:24,624
Get your hands off my wife!

209
00:41:24,624 --> 00:41:28,074
Get your hands off my wife!

210
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:32,472
Mommy! -Stand down!

211
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:36,371
Scan her again! Stand down!

212
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:38,871
Stand down soldier! Stand down.

213
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:42,421
I am lieutenant colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

214
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:43,920
Scan her again!

215
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:49,620
Alright, scan her again.

216
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,019
It's clear.

217
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,620
It's clear, move trough.

218
00:42:07,768 --> 00:42:10,568
Daddy, why can't they come too?

219
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:18,117
How long?
In 5 minutes. We'll make it.

220
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,916
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.

221
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:42,410
I wont take my eyes off them,
Colonel. You've got my word on it.

222
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:08,410
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert, and keep
him strong for the struggles ahead of him.

223
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,760
Please, just bring him home safely.
Amen.

224
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,460
Daddy is gonna make the
masses go away baby okay.

225
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,309
Sam you protect daddy. No baby, 
I can't. Daddy can't take the dog.

226
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:22,758
Sir, got to go.

227
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:29,558
Daddy I love you.
Look it's butterfly

228
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:36,256
Come on, go.

229
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:25,950
How did you sleep?
<i>-Doctor Neville will be taking a</i>

230
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,250
<i>closer look at the ongoing mutations
of doctor Alice Krippins... </i>

231
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:32,149
<i>...once
hailed miracle cure for cancer.</i>

232
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:37,299
<i>So far almost 5000 patients injected with the retro fitted virus,</i>

<i>have begun exhibiting symptoms resembling the early onset of rabies.</i>

234
00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:43,949
<i>25 patients have already died.</i>

235
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:47,847
<i>Doctor Neville has ordered local
hospitals to stockpile antiviral drugs</i>

236
00:44:48,698 --> 00:44:50,797
<i>and to begin preliminary
quarantine protocols.</i>

237
00:44:51,797 --> 00:44:53,396
It's my birthday.

238
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,604
<i>We are fully confident that doctor
Neville can see us trough,...</i>

239
00:44:56,796 --> 00:44:57,896
You know what I'm saying?

240
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:01,195
My name is Robert Neville,

241
00:45:02,695 --> 00:45:04,845
I am a survivor living in New York City.

242
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:10,795
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

243
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:16,043
I will be at the South Street
Port every day at midday.

244
00:45:16,194 --> 00:45:18,093
When the sun is highest in the sky.

245
00:45:20,194 --> 00:45:24,043
If you are out there,
if anyone is out there,

246
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:26,593
I can provide food,

247
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:28,992
I can provide shelter,

248
00:45:29,641 --> 00:45:31,243
I can provide security.

249
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:34,441
If there is anybody out there,

250
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:39,241
anybody, please,

251
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,090
you are not alone.

252
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,840
Listen, uh,

253
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,390
if you're planning a party or
something , 

254
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:48,640
just tell me now.

255
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,689
Ok, because, I don't like surprises.

256
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:53,839
I swear I'll act surprised. 

257
00:45:54,089 --> 00:45:54,889
Okay?

258
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:42,833
Hey, hey! What the hell are you
doing out there Fred?

259
00:46:46,732 --> 00:46:48,483
What the... What the hell,
are you...? 

260
00:46:48,632 --> 00:46:50,232
No! No! No!

261
00:46:54,382 --> 00:46:55,782
No!

262
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:57,681
What the hell are you
doing out here Fred?

263
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:00,730
How did you get out here?

264
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,130
Fred, if you are real you
better tell me right now!

265
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:07,329
If you are real you
better tell  me right now!

266
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,778
Damn it, Fred! Damn it!

267
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:57,958
I'm all right.

268
00:50:28,924 --> 00:50:29,924
All right, c'mon, c'mon.

269
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:30,925
Ok, I'm ok.

270
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,317
Let's go.

271
00:51:50,777 --> 00:51:52,954
Come on!

272
00:52:06,314 --> 00:52:07,878
Sam, come on!

273
00:52:07,879 --> 00:52:08,879
Let's go, Sam!

274
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:19,373
No! No! Let's go!

275
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:21,407
We gotta go home, Sam.

276
00:52:21,408 --> 00:52:22,408
Let's go!

277
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,939
Sam. Alright, you're alright.

278
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,940
It's ok, You're alright.

279
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:39,750
Samantha. Samantha, look at me girl.

280
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:43,820
Hey, you're ok. You're ok.

281
00:53:44,616 --> 00:53:46,043
Samantha, I just gotta get you home.

282
00:53:48,002 --> 00:53:49,517
I gotta get you... I'm
gonna take you home.

283
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,518
Alright, come here, come here.

284
00:54:28,179 --> 00:54:31,340
Come here, come here.
I got you.

285
00:58:35,698 --> 00:58:38,024
I promised my friend,

286
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,082
I'm gonna say hello,
to you today.

287
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,495
Hello.

288
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:01,080
Hello.

289
00:59:11,857 --> 00:59:13,617
Please say hello to me.

290
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:23,193
Please say hello to me.

291
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:01,307
Where do you live?

292
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:07,062
Where do you live?

293
01:03:07,063 --> 01:03:08,063
Where do you live?

294
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,068
I'm on 11 Washington and Square.

295
01:03:14,296 --> 01:03:16,150
You don't know where i live.

296
01:03:18,957 --> 01:03:20,995
Don't let them track us.

297
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,033
I... I must stay out till dawn.

298
01:06:14,185 --> 01:06:16,754
I am afraid the eggs are powdered.

299
01:06:16,755 --> 01:06:19,109
Obviously you know that.

300
01:06:20,151 --> 01:06:22,796
They are yours.
But I did find bacon.

301
01:06:23,707 --> 01:06:26,404
I just have found the most
fantastic thing in history.

302
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:30,083
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

303
01:06:30,084 --> 01:06:32,992
I put them by the plate,
because your leg is ok,

304
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:37,213
but it wouldn't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

305
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:39,853
Who are you?

306
01:06:41,886 --> 01:06:43,960
I am Anna and that's Ethan.

307
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:53,311
They'll get cold.

308
01:07:06,767 --> 01:07:08,703
It's ok, come on.

309
01:07:34,535 --> 01:07:38,773
We came from Maryland. We have
heard your message on the radio.

310
01:07:38,937 --> 01:07:42,314
We were at the pier at
noon. We waited all day.

311
01:07:44,413 --> 01:07:46,124
We are going to Vermont.

312
01:07:47,528 --> 01:07:50,851
To the survivors colony. 
-What?

313
01:07:53,245 --> 01:07:56,310
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.

314
01:07:56,935 --> 01:07:59,826
No, there's no survivals
colony, no safe zones.

315
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:03,866
Nothing happened they way it was supposed to
happen. Nothing work the way it was supposed to work.

316
01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:08,153
In the mountains, there is a whole colony
of people there, who didn't get sick.

317
01:08:08,773 --> 01:08:11,516
The virus, who didn't survive
the cold, there's a whole...

318
01:08:11,517 --> 01:08:12,517
Shut up!

319
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:16,840
Everybody is dead. Everybody is dead.

320
01:08:25,563 --> 01:08:27,914
I just need a minute. Ok?

321
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:38,579
I just... I just... I
was saving that bacon.

322
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,245
I was saving it.

323
01:08:44,384 --> 01:08:48,286
I just... I'm gonna go upstairs.
Alright? Just... Let me go.

324
01:09:06,513 --> 01:09:08,362
Ethan, put the knife down.

325
01:10:14,654 --> 01:10:18,403
<i>Can I say something to you?</i>

326
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:11,563
<i>Listen, you were really, really
something, back there.</i>

327
01:10:18,904 --> 01:10:21,003
<i> Incredible. Are you talking to...</i>

328
01:10:23,102 --> 01:10:23,902
<i>...me?</i>

329
01:10:25,402 --> 01:10:28,802
<i>Yes, I was talking to you.</i>

330
01:10:28,802 --> 01:10:32,051
<i>Can I just tell you that you were really
great back there with those guards.</i>

331
01:10:32,568 --> 01:10:33,568
<i>They thought that was all of that.</i>

332
01:10:33,569 --> 01:10:34,569
<i>And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping
on over themselves like in the babes woods.</i>

333
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:35,570
<i>That made me really good to see that.</i>

334
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:36,571
<i>Oh, that's great. Really.</i>

335
01:10:36,572 --> 01:10:37,572
<i>Man, it's good to be free.</i>

336
01:10:37,573 --> 01:10:38,573
<i>Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own fiends?</i>

337
01:10:38,574 --> 01:10:39,574
<i>But I...</i>

338
01:10:39,575 --> 01:10:40,575
<i>I don't have any friends.</i>

339
01:10:40,576 --> 01:10:41,576
<i>And I'm not going out there by myself.</i>

340
01:10:41,577 --> 01:10:42,577
<i>Hey wait a minute.
I have a great idea...</i>

341
01:10:42,578 --> 01:10:43,578
<i>I'll stick with you.</i>

342
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:04,316
I like Shrek.

343
01:11:20,647 --> 01:11:23,443
You are not so good with
people anymore, are you.

344
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,775
Thank you for my leg.

345
01:11:39,024 --> 01:11:40,358
Where have you been?

346
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:43,937
I was on a Red Cross evacuation
ship out off San Paolo.

347
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,164
Those boats weren't
meant to be permanent.

348
01:11:47,487 --> 01:11:49,206
No they weren't.

349
01:11:49,207 --> 01:11:52,513
When the Navy fell apart we
started docking to take on supplies.

350
01:11:52,514 --> 01:11:54,409
Someone picked it up on the shore.

351
01:11:54,502 --> 01:11:57,991
Five of us were immune. -You said five.

352
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:02,298
The "Dark seekers" caught them.

353
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:06,129
You are The Robert Neville, aren't you?

354
01:12:15,066 --> 01:12:19,809
It is too late today. If we move tomorrow at
dawn, we can make it to Vermont a straight shot.

355
01:12:19,943 --> 01:12:21,708
I'm not leaving.

356
01:12:23,334 --> 01:12:24,967
This is ground zero.

357
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:28,641
This is my site.

358
01:12:30,737 --> 01:12:32,419
I'm not gonna let this happen.

359
01:12:35,522 --> 01:12:37,311
I can still fix this.

360
01:12:51,926 --> 01:12:54,788
Wow, you scared me.

361
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,048
Sorry, I called down twice.

362
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,373
Ow, thank you.

363
01:13:04,506 --> 01:13:07,802
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

364
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:10,107
I've never seen one so still.

365
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:13,972
They're always biting.

366
01:13:17,882 --> 01:13:19,956
You think that can cure her?

367
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,405
No this will almost certainly kill it, but it is
possible by drastically reducing their body temperature,

368
01:13:25,406 --> 01:13:29,310
I can increase the
compound effectiveness.

369
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:45,053
Did all of them die? -Yes.

370
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,700
My God.

371
01:13:51,587 --> 01:13:54,257
God didn't do this, Anna. We did.

372
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,357
Where can Ethan sleep?

373
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,641
He is heavy.

374
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,681
She is beautiful. What's her name?

375
01:15:09,447 --> 01:15:11,397
Marley.

376
01:15:12,505 --> 01:15:14,364
Her name was Marley.

377
01:15:15,634 --> 01:15:16,738
It's a beautiful name.

378
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:20,463
We named her after

379
01:15:20,522 --> 01:15:22,068
Bob Marley.

380
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:25,068
Who? -The singer.

381
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:28,396
Damian?

382
01:15:30,637 --> 01:15:32,501
His father?

383
01:15:35,274 --> 01:15:37,500
His father.

384
01:15:56,777 --> 01:16:00,313
That is unacceptable. -What?

385
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:09,281
Best album ever made.

386
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,907
You don't recognize that?

387
01:16:24,973 --> 01:16:29,248
He had this idea, it was...
kind of veracious idea.

388
01:16:30,395 --> 01:16:35,693
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate literally cure it,

389
01:16:35,817 --> 01:16:38,941
by injecting music

390
01:16:39,068 --> 01:16:41,121
and love into peoples lives

391
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:46,528
When they was scheduled to
perform at a peace rally,

392
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:50,612
gunman came to his
house and shot him down.

393
01:16:52,682 --> 01:16:54,681
Two days later

394
01:16:54,682 --> 01:16:56,352
he walked out on that stage,

395
01:16:57,294 --> 01:16:59,782
and sang.

396
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,247
Somebody asked him "Why?".

397
01:17:03,843 --> 01:17:06,484
He said "The people,

398
01:17:06,893 --> 01:17:09,404
who are trying to make this world worse,

399
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,925
are not taking a day off.

400
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:14,427
How can I.

401
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:20,171
Light up the darkness."

402
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:48,525
Come with us, Neville.

403
01:17:49,797 --> 01:17:51,415
To the colony.

404
01:17:55,306 --> 01:17:57,194
There is no colony, Anna.

405
01:18:02,002 --> 01:18:04,889
Everything just fell apart.
There was no evacuation.

406
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,444
You're wrong. There is a colony.

407
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:09,606
I know, ok.

408
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,648
How do you know, Anna?

409
01:18:18,745 --> 01:18:20,551
I just know.

410
01:18:22,059 --> 01:18:27,715
How? I said how do you
know? How could you know?

411
01:18:27,716 --> 01:18:31,652
God told me. He has a plan.

412
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,699
God told you. -Yes.

413
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:39,237
The God? -Yes.

414
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:43,564
I know how this sounds.
-It sounds crazy.

415
01:18:43,565 --> 01:18:46,645
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

416
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:49,539
Something told me to come here.

417
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:52,648
My voice on the radio told
you to come here, Anna.

418
01:18:52,707 --> 01:18:55,241
You were trying to kill yourself
last night, right? -Anna.

419
01:18:56,011 --> 01:18:59,795
And i got here just in time
to save your life. -Stop it.

420
01:18:59,796 --> 01:19:00,796
Do you think it's a
coincidence. -Just stop it.

421
01:19:00,437 --> 01:19:02,231
He must have sent me here
for a reason. -Stop it.

422
01:19:04,735 --> 01:19:08,923
Neville, the world is quieter
now. You just have to listen.

423
01:19:09,766 --> 01:19:11,481
If we listen,

424
01:19:12,155 --> 01:19:14,235
we can hear God's plan.

425
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,165
God's plan. -Yeah.

426
01:19:16,987 --> 01:19:18,848
Alright, let me tell you
about your God's plan.

427
01:19:19,647 --> 01:19:22,499
It was 6 billion people on
Earth, when the infection hit.

428
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:27,183
KV had a 90 percent kill rate,
that's 5,4 billion people dead,

429
01:19:27,209 --> 01:19:31,720
crashed and bled out. Dead.

430
01:19:32,539 --> 01:19:34,700
Less than 1 percent immunity,

431
01:19:35,086 --> 01:19:38,895
left 12 million healthy
people, like you, me and Ethan.

432
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:42,442
The other 588 million

433
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,158
turned into your "Dark seekers".

434
01:19:45,352 --> 01:19:51,265
And then they got hungry, and
they killed an fed on everybody.

435
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:54,202
Everybody!

436
01:19:54,979 --> 01:20:00,681
Every singled person that
you or I has ever known,

437
01:20:00,752 --> 01:20:02,463
is dead!

438
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:06,755
Dead!

439
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,944
There is no God. There is no God!

440
01:20:16,056 --> 01:20:18,091
What is that?

441
01:20:21,501 --> 01:20:23,780
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

442
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:27,891
You were bleeding. There
was light on the horizon.

443
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,786
Turn the light off. Turn it off!

444
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,681
They followed us home.

445
01:20:41,313 --> 01:20:42,621
Ethan!

446
01:21:46,889 --> 01:21:48,799
Anna!

447
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:55,180
Anna!

448
01:21:55,181 --> 01:21:56,181
Anna!

449
01:21:56,182 --> 01:21:57,182
Anna!

450
01:21:57,183 --> 01:21:58,183
Anna!

451
01:21:58,184 --> 01:21:59,184
Anna!

452
01:25:05,418 --> 01:25:06,502
Come on. Come on.

453
01:25:08,143 --> 01:25:10,103
Are you ok?

454
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,231
You all right? Are you all right?

455
01:25:14,232 --> 01:25:15,232
Are you ok?

456
01:25:28,173 --> 01:25:30,831
Into the lab. Downstairs, go!

457
01:25:32,012 --> 01:25:34,047
Into the lab! Into the lab!

458
01:25:43,523 --> 01:25:45,641
Get behind the plexi.

459
01:25:45,642 --> 01:25:46,642
Go on. Come on.

460
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:01,739
Come on, it's ok, it's ok.

461
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,326
Ow my God.

462
01:26:17,397 --> 01:26:18,589
It's working.

463
01:26:23,781 --> 01:26:25,790
Neville.

464
01:26:26,326 --> 01:26:27,466
It's working.

465
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:36,604
No! Stop! Stop!

466
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:41,101
Look, look! I can save you.
I can save... I can help you.

467
01:26:41,169 --> 01:26:42,501
You are sick, and I can help you.

468
01:26:45,543 --> 01:26:49,101
I can... I can fix this.
I can save everybody

469
01:26:51,502 --> 01:26:53,328
It's working.

470
01:26:55,839 --> 01:26:57,957
Stop, stop, please.

471
01:27:03,289 --> 01:27:06,328
I can save you! Let me save you!

472
01:27:19,027 --> 01:27:20,812
No, no!

473
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:40,413
Daddy, look it's a butterfly.

474
01:28:07,505 --> 01:28:08,595
Neville. What are you doing?

475
01:28:08,653 --> 01:28:10,366
The cure is in her blood.

476
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:17,152
You're gonna be safe. Ethan get in!

477
01:28:18,706 --> 01:28:20,420
Come on, get in, get in.

478
01:28:24,585 --> 01:28:26,286
Anna. I think this is why you are here.

479
01:28:29,797 --> 01:28:31,275
What are you doing?

480
01:28:32,084 --> 01:28:33,650
I'm listening.

481
01:28:34,712 --> 01:28:36,200
Neville, there is room in here. Come.

482
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:40,041
They're not gonna stop.
They're not gonna stop.

483
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,055
