2
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:39,039
This is Helo 1. I have
visual confirmation on Hodaddy.

3
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:42,918
Still negative on our bad boy.
Repeat. Still negative on the pickup.

4
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:47,002
Heading for rendezv ous
at LZ Alpha Echo.

5
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,326
All right, where are you, Percy?
Come on. Come on.

6
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,767
Wait a second. There's our turncoat.

7
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,684
For crying out loud.

8
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:47,477
Special Agent Scott.

9
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,924
Mac here.
Tell me you found that pilot.

10
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:52,683
Absolutely. He's right here.

11
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:54,968
- Here you go.
- Is he alive?

12
00:01:58,849 --> 00:01:59,918
Yeah, he's okay.

13
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,557
Don't screw this up, Alex.
I want him in one piece.

14
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,560
Consider it done.

15
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,320
- You okay?
- No, my leg's broken!

16
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,764
You got ice on it right away.
That should help.

17
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,960
Let's go before the Russians
get here.

18
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,883
Hey, let me ask you something.

19
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,768
What'd you do with that plane
that you stole?

20
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:34,846
Here they come.

21
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,806
I'm not talking until you get me out.

22
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,318
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,127
All right, let's go.

24
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,122
God! Okay! Gundars!

25
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,043
I sold the plane to Arnold Gundars.
Now get me out of here!

26
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:50,205
Get up.

27
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:52,440
Hurry! The American pilot
has escaped!

28
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,082
Search the woods!
He must be in the woods!

29
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,681
What is this?

30
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,885
Stalin's butt!
He tricked us!

31
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,644
- They're coming!
- I got it.

32
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:27,600
No, I don't.

33
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,205
Fire!

34
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:47,122
You okay?

35
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,325
Ladies and gentlemen,
now making his way to the ring...

36
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,368
...really needing no introduction
the world over, he is undefeated...

37
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:12,918
...with 56 wins, no losses...

38
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:16,126
...here is the one and only...

39
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,568
...Kelly "K. O." Robinson!

40
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,721
When I say break, break clean.
Keep those punches up high.

41
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,038
I'm fair, but I'm firm.

42
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,917
You'll have your first
Sports Illustrated cover.

43
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:30,966
Even though you'll be on it like this:

44
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,564
- We'll see who looks like that.
- Touch them up.

45
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,607
Yeah, shit.
He's scary as hell, ain't he?

46
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,127
Kelly Robinson has come up with
an exotic new challenge for himself.

47
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,041
If he defends his title tonight...

48
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:51,358
...he'll do it again Thursday
in Budapest, Hungary.

49
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,927
I know what this means.

50
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,205
I know what this mean
when you do that.

51
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:01,560
And Lirette is on queer street.

52
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,959
You know what's gonna
happen now, right?

53
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,047
Boy, fight now! What you doing?

54
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,848
Kelly's getting frustrated
because Lirette won't fight.

55
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:15,081
I'll give you a free shot.
I won't chase you around the ring.

56
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:17,319
Take a shot at this here.

57
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,681
Don't be scared. I'll close my eyes.

58
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:21,043
How about that?

59
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,999
Three! Four!

60
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,205
Five! Six!

61
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:41,202
Seven! Eight! Nine!

62
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,241
Ten! You're out!

63
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,048
Warm up the goulash in Budapest.

64
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,325
Kelly Robinson is coming.

65
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:52,118
I told you. Hold on. Come on,
get this shot for Sports Illustrated.

66
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:53,723
Cheese.

67
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:04,726
Yeah.

68
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,282
Yeah, 57 and 0. Gonna be 58 and 0
in couple of days.

69
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,679
Put infinity on there because
I'll never lose.

70
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,123
I know what you saying.

71
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,087
You better retire. You gonna
run out of space on that arm.

72
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,207
Jerry, you ain't got to do that.
You been my boy for 10 years.

73
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,599
Don't blow smoke up my ass.
Get your head out my ass.

74
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,361
- Head's out the ass.
- Relax, man.

75
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,520
Yeah, seriously, Jerry.
That's pathetic.

76
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:27,886
You've only worked three years.
Keep your head where it's at.

77
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,846
- Now, about the drawers.
- Yeah.

78
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,762
I think I got some drawers
your size made of liquorice.

79
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:35,922
Hello, sir. Yes, right. Hold on, sir.

80
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:37,238
Kelly.

81
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,001
- Kelly!
- Yeah? What's going on?

82
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:40,363
It's the president.

83
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:42,360
Really?
President of the United States.

84
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:45,043
The president want to talk
to Kelly Robinson.

85
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,801
- Mr. President?
- What's up, homey?

86
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,368
- What's up?
- What's up, dog?

87
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:50,963
- It's all good. How you doing?
- Kicking with Putin.

88
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:53,689
G.W.B., you should've called
when the cameras was on.

89
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,999
- My bad. I got a mucho hush-hush.
- All right.

90
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,479
Hear you're going to Budapest. We
got us a muy secret-o situation.

91
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,958
- Really?
- America needs your help.

92
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,324
- No problem.
- We need a little civilian cover.

93
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,002
- You got it, baby.
- Owe you one.

94
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,241
- All right, I'll talk to you real soon.
- I will not forget...

95
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,161
President want me to do him a favour.

96
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:13,240
He said something
about America needs me.

97
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:16,446
- What kind of favour?
- Some kind of top-secret mission.

98
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:18,486
Oh, you mean like 007?

99
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:21,243
Yeah, except only I'm
gonna be 009 and a half.

100
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,687
Know what I'm saying? 007. You
know what 009 and a half means?

101
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,328
- I think so.
- It's an innuendo.

102
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:33,162
- You're going to Budapest?
- Yes, I am. Kind of exciting.

103
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,569
- I'm a little nervous.
- I'm sure you'll do fine.

104
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,845
No, I know I will.

105
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:41,563
That's got a kick to it.

106
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,278
This is my first chance to work
with Special Agent Rachel Wright.

107
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:47,838
Rachel. You're still hung up on her?

108
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,522
Edna, I'm not hung up on her.

109
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:51,919
I find her interesting,
and I admire her work.

110
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:53,761
There's a certain allure she has.

111
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,681
You know, a blind man could
see that.

112
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,248
Well, why don't you tell her?

113
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:01,880
I will tell her. It's just, I get nervous,
and I end up sounding like an idiot...

114
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,399
Want me to tell you how
to melt Rachel's heart?

115
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,605
- Yeah.
- Talk to Carlos.

116
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:10,521
What does that mean?
They had a thing?

117
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,725
Two-week stakeout.
She could barely walk.

118
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,641
Rachel and Carlos?

119
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,606
You called, Edna?

120
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,007
You are a vision, as always.

121
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:22,405
Hello, Alex.

122
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,639
Hello, Carlos. How was Cuba?

123
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,527
Adequate.

124
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,168
Oh, adequate, my eye.

125
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,524
He single-handedly averted
another Bay of Pigs.

126
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:31,678
- No, I didn't...
- Yes.

127
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,441
- You exaggerate.
- Oh, well, I...

128
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:36,407
- You do exaggerate sometimes.
- Okay, at times, yeah.

129
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:37,684
And you, Alex?

130
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,399
How did you fare in the tundra?

131
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,842
You know, I did pretty good.

132
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:46,843
I got selected for a new mission, so
obviously everybody was satisfied.

133
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,118
And the pilot?

134
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,846
The pilot...

135
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:56,127
Was able to talk to him, get some
valuable information from him.

136
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:57,688
Successful mission.

137
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:01,728
Alex, you didn't go and get
him killed, now, did you?

138
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,086
No, no, no. I mean...

139
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,524
You know, sort of. I mean...
Yeah, he's dead.

140
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:09,645
He's dead.

141
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,205
What are you gonna do?

142
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,998
- Let me tell you something, Alex.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:21,082
You're an excellent agent.
Don't let results like this fool you.

144
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:23,001
All right?

145
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,318
My car. Be back for my things later.

146
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,600
See you, Carlos. La vida loca!

147
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,484
What a phoney.

148
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,526
I'd give anything to go on
a two-week stakeout with that man.

149
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:45,442
What happened on the stakeout
between him and Rachel?

150
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:49,727
- I didn't hear anything.
- It's not what I heard, it's what I saw.

151
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,086
It's what I saw.
I saw the look on her face.

152
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,046
Every woman recognizes that look.

153
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,201
- What's that look?
- Look of total satisfaction.

154
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:09,241
Guy gets a couple missions in Latin
America, and he's a Julio Iglesias.

155
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,049
You know, he's from lowa,
by the way.

156
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:11,799
You know, he's from lowa,
by the way.

157
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,880
- Is this my stuff?
- Oh, easy.

158
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:17,485
This is Carlos' stuff. This is yours.

159
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:25,119
Where's my monofilament
phone descender?

160
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:29,359
I didn't get one of these exploding
pagers. I don't see one of those.

161
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,317
You got the micro GPS.

162
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,922
Micro?

163
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:34,644
This is your spy-cam.

164
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,522
This is Carlos' spy-cam,
and this is my spy-cam?

165
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,327
Look at the size of this thing!

166
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:46,923
Size matters.
But in the spy world, it's reversed.

167
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,764
You want people to say, " Look how
small and sexy and sleek this is."

168
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:54,683
Not, " How huge this is! Look what he
pulled out of his pants. It's huge!"

169
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:58,922
People will laugh at me if I pull this
out. Is that his escape module?

170
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,286
Yes, it is. I know, everybody wants
to be like Carlos.

171
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:04,838
I don't want to be like Carlos,
but I notice...

172
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,763
...my stuff looks like you can get it
from RadioShack in 1972.

173
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:12,918
Yes, it is.

174
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,646
Right away.

175
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,926
All right, we'll finish this later.
It's a good start, though.

176
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,008
Kelly Robinson, seen here making
his typical flamboyant entrance...

177
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,763
Shouldn't this be on the
Weather Channel or something?

178
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,807
- with a first-round knock out
of Blak e "The Blade" Lirette.

179
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:38,838
Yeah! 57 and 0, baby!
Kelly Robinson, baby!

180
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,045
That guy is so annoying.

181
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,006
Everybody "Hungary"
for his showdown...

182
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,729
...with the European
heavyweight king, Cedric Mills.

183
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,039
You don't understand
how important it is...

184
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,928
...that I be 58 and 0.
I'm 57 and 0 right now.

185
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:52,238
This man gonna be 58!

186
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,639
- That guy is a born jerk.
- Cheese. Cheese.

187
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:57,084
That's right, tak e my picture.
Cheese. Cheese.

188
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,444
Get my right side. Cheese.

189
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:02,360
Alex!

190
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,838
Gen. Tucker, this is
Special Agent Alex Scott.

191
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,601
- General.
- Special agent.

192
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,841
I love hearing that. I was a regular
agent a couple weeks ago...

193
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,206
...and then around Christmas,
I got promoted to special.

194
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:14,888
Special.

195
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,922
We were going over the op.

196
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,762
We call it the Switchblade.

197
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,808
It was the first electrochromatic
invisible stealth aircraft.

198
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:24,766
But in the hands of the evildoers...

199
00:12:24,929 --> 00:12:28,399
...it's an untraceable delivery system
for weapons of mass destruction.

200
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,048
New owner: Arnold Gundars.

201
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,565
The boys over at CIA have access
to his overseas accounts.

202
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:36,607
The past five days, there's been
a depletion of funds...

203
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:38,043
...without reimbursements.

204
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,280
The bastard's bought
the damn plane.

205
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:41,723
He just hasn't sold it yet.

206
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,398
I'll get it back, general.

207
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,006
Give me a minute.

208
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:50,838
Hot.

209
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,441
Are you sure we can't use Carlos?

210
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,803
No, they all know him.

211
00:12:56,969 --> 00:13:00,564
Without plastic surgery, he wouldn't
last five minutes on this case.

212
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,208
That's a shame.

213
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:03,961
That Carlos is amazing.

214
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:06,760
This guy...

215
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:09,720
You sure about this, Mac?

216
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,119
He'll get the job done.

217
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,437
Shouldn't Rachel be here?

218
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,361
She's already in Budapest
setting up.

219
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,599
You've worked with her
before, right?

220
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,680
I have but not
in a stakeout situation.

221
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,085
This mission doesn't call
for a stakeout.

222
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:27,365
It wouldn't hurt to keep
our options open.

223
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,845
The European middleweight
championship...

224
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,000
...is being held in Budapest
in two days.

225
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,605
Gundars is a boxing fanatic. He's
throwing a party the night before.

226
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:38,237
Okay. Classic stakeout
scenario, right?

227
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,765
No, Alex. No stakeout. This is
more about hacking and tracking.

228
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:45,001
Now, take a look at this guest list.

229
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:50,323
You got to be kidding. This is like a
who's who of international bad guys.

230
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,799
Obviously, Gundars is using this
party as cover to auction the plane.

231
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,925
Your mission is to get
into his palace...

232
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,081
...find out where the plane is
and stop him from selling it.

233
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:02,480
With these heavy hitters in one
place, security's gonna be insane.

234
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,847
Exactly. The way we see it, there's
only one shot to get you in there.

235
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:09,924
Stakeout?

236
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,523
No.

237
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,645
We've arranged cover.

238
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,083
You'll be working with a civilian
to secure entry.

239
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,238
A civilian?

240
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:23,640
57 and 0. Gonna be 58 and 0.
You know how Kelly Robinson do.

241
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,482
Listen to me now. I don't
care what Gen. Patton says.

242
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,879
We don't need to do it this way.
I think if...

243
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:30,687
I kick ed ass all around the world.

244
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:34,000
For crying out loud. Can we turn
this off or change the channel?

245
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,488
He gives me a headache...

246
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,209
Watch what come out of your
mouth, blond surfer boy.

247
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,883
He never shuts up. He's lighting
into some reporter.

248
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,847
No, I'm talking to you. Watch
what come out of your mouth.

249
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,524
You digging your grave with your
tongue. You'll get your ass whipped.

250
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:48,804
Video conference.

251
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,120
Alex Scott, meet Kelly Robinson.

252
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,688
That's gotta be him.

253
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:21,079
Yeah, girl, you crazy. Come on out
here and give me some sugar, girl.

254
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:23,922
I had too much fun last night.
And you too.

255
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:29,325
Let's bounce. I got y'all's numbers.
I'll call y'all soon.

256
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,480
I'll talk to you all soon.
Bye-bye.

257
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,640
No Kelly, no stretchie.
Back of the bus.

258
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,926
Move the camouflage booty to the
back of the bus. Come on.

259
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:43,888
Hey, I'm Alex Scott.
We met yesterday, sort of.

260
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,688
Yeah, I remember.
The pleasure's all mine.

261
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:49,917
Is that your plane?

262
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:51,442
Step away! No autographs!

263
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,606
It's all right. He's my new assistant.

264
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:55,725
Kelly, I thought I was your assistant.

265
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,847
T.J., what'd I tell you?
The secret mission? Secret mission.

266
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,000
Secret mission.

267
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,400
- Yeah, yeah, the Mission Man.
- Right. Right.

268
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:13,645
It's not a good idea to tell them who
I am. We should keep that down.

269
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:16,039
I ain't no fool. I ain't
tell them who you was.

270
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,882
I said I had to take care
of the president's retarded nephew.

271
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,847
- What?
- Yeah, they think you're a retard.

272
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:26,127
All you do is get some drool, a helmet
and zip your jacket up.

273
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,280
You get that
mentally challenged look.

274
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:30,917
Hold on just a second. That's good.

275
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:35,958
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, go ahead. What's up?

276
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,599
Excuse us. Uncomfortable.
Too many brothers standing around.

277
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,566
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

278
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,799
You think you're
the Harlem Globetrotters...

279
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,039
...and I'm the team
that looks like an idiot.

280
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,848
- Yeah, that's it.
- But that's not how it's gonna work.

281
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,284
We're on the same team.
I'm Meadowlark Lemon.

282
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,521
You're Curly Neal. You feed
me the ball. Remember Curly, he...

283
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:56,327
He do the dribbling.
You Meadowlark?

284
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:59,481
I'm pulling down the ref's shorts,
throwing pie in the face.

285
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,719
- The bucket of confetti.
- They think it's water.

286
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,642
- And the rubber band on the ball.
- Right, doing the...

287
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,403
Meadowlark, you get me
some of this chicken...

288
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,959
...some sodas, jelly beans and get
these bags and get on the plane.

289
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,245
Meadowlark. You heard
what he said to me?

290
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:17,404
He told me that in this situation, he
would be Meadowlark and I'm Curly.

291
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,721
What kind of bullshit is that?
Curly, my ass. I'm Meadowlark.

292
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,799
- I'm not Kelly Robinson.
- No, you ain't.

293
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:31,006
- He don't make his own phone calls.
- He don't call his mama!

294
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,161
Come on. I'm just trying
to confirm the man's reservation.

295
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,047
- All we need is a room.
- That's all.

296
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:39,724
- Don't make me get on that phone.
- What the hell is:

297
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,409
It means, " I speak English,
just not to you, sucker."

298
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,129
Guys, I speak Hungarian.
Need some help?

299
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:48,881
- Okay.
- Yeah, knock yourself out.

300
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,927
The brother gonna
speak Hungarian now.

301
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:53,158
- Szia.
- Hello?

302
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,318
Igen, igen.

303
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:58,004
You guys want the junior suite
or the high-roller suite?

304
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:01,038
We go with the high-roller.

305
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,598
The cheapest room you've got.

306
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,806
In the basement.

307
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,527
- It's all taken care of.
- Did you get an extra kusenum?

308
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,486
I'm gonna get these bags onboard.

309
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:15,278
- Don't wanna get yelled at again.
- Yeah, yeah. Hustle. Hustle on.

310
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:19,362
You better watch your job.
Rain Man got skills.

311
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,285
Kelly just took the stick.

312
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,607
- I thought he was doing an interview.
- What? He was napping.

313
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:32,920
What? Now he's flying the plane?
Come on, Kelly!

314
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,884
There's a lot of stuff
for us to go over...

315
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,279
Did you see me turn on
the seat-belt light?

316
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,360
No, I didn't see that.

317
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:51,160
Sit your ass down!
When you get up, sit down.

318
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:54,962
Funny.

319
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:59,608
He's a funny guy.
I gotta remember that one.

320
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:03,444
When you did the stick up, I went
flying there! That's a good trick.

321
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,839
I'm glad you got that
out of your system.

322
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:08,125
I'm gonna need you
at the party at 8.

323
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,883
Know something?
We got to change the schedule.

324
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,325
Kelly Robinson don't go to parties
at 8:00. I ain't about to start.

325
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:16,957
Are you gonna refer to yourself
in the third person?

326
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:18,642
That can get irritating.

327
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,800
It won't get irritating until 11:00...

328
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:24,405
...because that's when I'm
showing up for your little party.

329
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,323
Okay. Excuse me, gents.

330
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:31,802
I can't risk that. The party could
clear out by 11:00.

331
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,961
Ain't no party that Kelly Robinson
at gonna end at 11:00.

332
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:38,519
- That attitude can destroy a mission.
- Know what destroys a mission?

333
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:42,762
A lame-ass party that end at 11:00.
Let that shit go, man.

334
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:44,726
- Drop the shit.
- Okay.

335
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:48,882
- I'll get T.J. or Jerry to get me in.
- Yeah, go get T.J. He'll help you.

336
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,280
I just hope that the optical
diaphanous polyalloy transducers...

337
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:54,440
...can fit on one of their retinas.

338
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,600
What you say?
What you got over there?

339
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:59,806
It's one of the things we've got
for the mission. It's cool.

340
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:02,529
It opens up. I put this little camera
in my eye...

341
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:05,726
...and I give this to T.J.
Then he can see everything I see.

342
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:11,009
Wait. I don't want T.J.'s eye juices
on something that goes in my eye.

343
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,080
Maybe I should try it.
What you call it?

344
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:16,480
- Polyalloy transducers.
- The polyalloy should be for me.

345
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,480
Let me put it in my eye, then.

346
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:21,084
- I put this in my eye?
- Put it in your eye.

347
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:22,648
- This is some spy shit?
- Yeah.

348
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,925
Okay, I'll put this in.

349
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,647
And I got
the camera in my eye.

350
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,488
What's gonna happen now?

351
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,321
Can you see anything?

352
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,079
What about now?

353
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,480
- Hey, I see me!
- Look, watch this.

354
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,721
That's bad. Shit, now I see the TV.
I'm seeing what you seeing.

355
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,722
- Exactly.
- I see me looking at you looking at me!

356
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:43,800
Hey, Kelly Robinson.

357
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:47,803
Look at this. Put this behind
your ear. It's a listening device.

358
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:50,199
- Just stick it back here?
- Can you hear me?

359
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:53,441
Yeah, it sound like you
in my head. Shit, I like this!

360
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:55,201
We'll do that on the mission.

361
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:57,280
- At 11:00, though.
- No, not 11:00.

362
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:00,759
I already spoke. Kelly Robinson
has spoke. I said 11, it's 11.

363
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,840
It's a dead issue. Let it go.

364
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,284
I said 11, goddamn it!
Get out my face!

365
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:07,644
- That shit is bad.
- Then give them back.

366
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,561
I ain't giving back shit. Take them.

367
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:12,448
That look like I'm yelling at me.
Take them!

368
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:16,158
I'm Kelly Robinson, baby, 57 and 0!
I'll kick your ass!

369
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:19,685
This is what it look like when I'm
whupping somebody's ass.

370
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,409
That's scary. Kelly.
Oh, yeah, that's scary.

371
00:21:22,569 --> 00:21:25,402
Look at that move.
Kelly Robinson.

372
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:29,404
Why you staring at me?
Do something.

373
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,129
- Okay, Kelly.
- I heard that in my head.

374
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,645
You looking in the cockpit right now.
That's a trip.

375
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,279
- What's our altitude?
- About 37,000 feet.

376
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:43,601
- Is that a Cessna on the horizon?
- Where?

377
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:48,402
Surfer boy!

378
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:51,526
- You seeing this?
- What are you doing?

379
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:54,283
- Come fly the plane.
- Wake him back up!

380
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:57,282
- He fell asleep.
- You put that dart in his back!

381
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:00,567
- I thought you knew how to fly it.
- Wake him up.

382
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:04,768
I don't know how to fly it!
He put it on automatic for me!

383
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,444
The deal is, we go at 8,
and I wake the pilot up.

384
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:11,203
Okay, then let the plane crash.
Let it crash.

385
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:14,361
You know that ride I just took?
Get ready for a great ride.

386
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,089
I'm ready to die, baby.
I'm Kelly Robinson.

387
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:20,958
Death? That's how I feel
about death. Go on. Crash it.

388
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,960
This is getting crazy.
Wake the man up.

389
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:31,166
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes. Just wake the man up!

390
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:36,724
- Hey, Ken. He ain't woke.
- He'll wake up. He'll be fine.

391
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,120
- So you a pilot this whole time?
- I can fly a little.

392
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,041
Okay, I see how this is gonna work.

393
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:45,838
I ain't coming to no party at 8:00.
I told you 11:00. Here's your eye.

394
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,045
- Hey, be careful with that.
- Hey, my ass.

395
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:52,885
If you broke something in my plane,
if something in my plane is broke...

396
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,639
You in trouble, T.J.

397
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,482
Oh, God.

398
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,843
It wasn't my fault, man.
It was Mission Man.

399
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:22,240
I'm going downstairs! No, we in
the basement. I'm going upstairs.

400
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:26,368
You got five minutes to get me
the most expensive suite...

401
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,407
...or else, T.J.! Or else!
- Or else what?

402
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:33,357
I don't know what else, because
I don't think good underground.

403
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,999
But whatever it is, it's gonna be bad!
Let me tell you something.

404
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:40,605
You falling off. You're gonna
be back in St. Louis, frying fish.

405
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:43,602
Now, you mess up one
more time again. I'm waiting.

406
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:46,761
Please do it one more. Just please.
One more time.

407
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:50,046
One more time. Please let him do it
one more time.

408
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:51,963
Oh, my God.

409
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,929
Hey! How's the room?

410
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:01,402
My room is fine. Oh, did I say
11? I meant to say 12. Maybe.

411
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:03,719
- What's with the attitude?
- Excuse me!

412
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:08,519
- Kelly Robinson? The famous boxer?
- Yeah, one and the same, baby.

413
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:11,806
- I can't believe it!
- It's a big thrill for you, huh?

414
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:16,360
You don't know. I know you from
the advertisement for your perfume.

415
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:19,168
- Kelly Robinson. TKO.
- TKO. That's right.

416
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:21,240
It's not perfume. It's cologne.

417
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,446
Perfume is for ladies and sissies.
I put out cologne.

418
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:25,724
I so stupid.

419
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:29,245
So, Kelly, tell me...

420
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,687
...do you really wear it?

421
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,684
Well, you tell me.

422
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,163
I'd love to go to your room
and get your autograph.

423
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:48,244
Is that right? I'd really love to, but
unfortunately, my room ain't ready.

424
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,839
Let's go to mine. Is very...

425
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:53,765
...very close.
- Hey, hey.

426
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,363
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
Excuse me.

427
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,282
- No. Come here for a second.
- Excuse me.

428
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:01,599
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

429
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,885
Nothing. But if you let go
of my arm...

430
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,199
...l'm gonna go across
and wax that ass.

431
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:09,679
You are a spy right now.
I can't have you running off...

432
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:11,567
...with a strange Hungarian woman.

433
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:14,846
I'm Kelly Robinson. Going off
with a strange woman is what I do.

434
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,887
Mind your own business.
Have a good evening, all right?

435
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,927
- I'm just jealous.
- I know, but she chose Kelly.

436
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:23,364
I'll hit it once for you, all right?

437
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:27,647
- See if she's got a sister.
- lf so, it'll be the three of us.

438
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:31,085
Why don't you go see the city?
What you say your name was?

439
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:35,800
- Are you going to scream it?
- I will scream your name if I know it.

440
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:39,120
I had a couple of interesting
situations where...

441
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,520
- What happened?
- The girl tried to press charges...

442
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,849
Hey, slow it down!
I got a lady over here.

443
00:25:50,689 --> 00:25:53,601
Hey, that's some serious road rage.

444
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:56,843
What's up, man?
What's all this?

445
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:02,207
How long have you been working
for the U.S. government?

446
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:05,725
- I work for Kelly Robinson.
- There was BNS agent on your jet.

447
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:07,288
- I don't know.
- Who was he?

448
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:11,488
- You've been reading spy novels.
- Maybe we should cut off his penis.

449
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:15,642
Cut off my penis? What happened
to "rough the man up"?

450
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,606
- Cut it off!
- Wait a second!

451
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:21,728
You ain't cutting off nobody's penis!
I'll answer all your questions, but...

452
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:24,608
- Who's the agent?
- I'm not sure if he's an agent.

453
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:28,921
- Who's the agent?
- I don't know if he's an agent or not!

454
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:32,126
- He's 5 foot 9. Blond hair...
- His name?

455
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:36,077
I'm not sure, but he's very annoying.
He's definitely a BNS agent.

456
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:37,364
His name?

457
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,919
Y'all got these knives and guns
pointing at me, so I'm blocking!

458
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:43,557
He got one of them white names.
Alan or...

459
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:46,880
- Take off his pants.
- Why you gonna take my pants off?

460
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:49,483
Please don't cut off
Kelly Robinson's penis.

461
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:51,847
Freeze!

462
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:06,087
Kelly! Kelly, shoot her!

463
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:08,123
Shoot her!

464
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,762
Did I kill her?

465
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:20,127
Not yet.

466
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:24,678
- Stop shooting that.
- What the hell's going...?

467
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:29,525
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.
Special Agent Rachel Wright.

468
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,283
- Nice to officially meet you.
- You're a spy!

469
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:34,485
Don't tell anyone.

470
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,321
- You're all BNS?
- It's all BNS.

471
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,322
- Big fan, Mr. Robinson!
- Crazy way of showing it.

472
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:43,166
- God, Alex, you been working out?
- Yeah, a little. Why?

473
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,685
- You just got buff.
- Just doing curls.

474
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,245
Two, three drops of me
come out of this.

475
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:53,197
Alex wanted to test you
before we put you in the game.

476
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:57,885
- So this whole thing was a big test?
- Unbelievable. That was great.

477
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,277
- Really?
- Really.

478
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:00,598
Oh, cool.

479
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:03,602
- Guys, excuse us for a second.
- Yeah.

480
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,079
- Hey, good job.
- Nice work, nice work. Good.

481
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:10,643
I have seen hundreds of agents...

482
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,119
...put through that exercise, and
I've never seen it handled so well.

483
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:16,166
- Never.
- Never.

484
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:17,887
Yeah. Well, Kelly Robinson.

485
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,324
It was like your instincts
were perfect.

486
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,684
Give them unimportant information.

487
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:26,967
Like he's blond, 5'9".
How many guys fit that description?

488
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,087
That doesn't mean anything.
You'd never name names.

489
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:34,640
You know what you are? You're a
"why not" guy, not a "why" guy.

490
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,800
- What's the difference?
- A "why" guy's like:

491
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:41,247
"Why are we gonna do this?"
They're afraid to make a decision.

492
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,481
Afraid they might get in trouble.
As opposed to a "why not" guy.

493
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:48,278
- He's like, "Roll the dice."
- That's me. Kelly Robinson.

494
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:51,009
The "why not" guys are
like eagles. They don't flock.

495
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:53,080
The few, the proud, the "why not."

496
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:56,525
The president wouldn't have called
me if I wasn't a "why not" guy.

497
00:28:56,689 --> 00:28:58,202
Let me see everything.

498
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,042
Now, Kelly, we gotta
get you up to speed.

499
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:03,359
You're about to hear
a national secret.

500
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:08,922
This is Arnold Gundars, premier
arms dealer. He has this plane...

501
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:10,408
...the Switchblade.

502
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:13,686
It's a sophisticated prototype
stolen from the U.S. government.

503
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,488
This is the next generation
of stealth technology.

504
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:19,686
Undetectable to radar, infrared,
even the human eye.

505
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:23,080
- Our mission is to get it back.
- To make a long story short...

506
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:26,764
...we can't find it,
because we can't see it.

507
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:30,441
Here it is with the electrochromatic
cloaking device engaged.

508
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:32,884
Like one of those bugs
that look like a leaf.

509
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,643
- One of the who?
- There's this bug that...

510
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,845
...stays safe because
it looks like a leaf.

511
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,126
But it's not really a leaf.
It can make itself look like one.

512
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:46,044
A leafy bug. It's a good name for it.
You should call that the "Leafy Bug."

513
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,444
- That's a good idea.
- I'll pass that on.

514
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:53,000
The Leafy Bug. We gotta go. We'll be
late for the mission. It's almost 8:00.

515
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:55,888
You owe me one belt. Yamaguchi.
Hey, you got a cell phone?

516
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:58,119
- Tuxedo.
- I'm gonna set that all up.

517
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:02,441
Hey, Alex, I'm sorry I kneed you and
roughed you up in there. You okay?

518
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:06,158
My gosh, don't be ridiculous.
I thought that was great.

519
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,285
When you kneed me, I loved that.

520
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:12,920
- You did? You loved that?
- I just felt it helped sell it.

521
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,205
Made it convincing.

522
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:20,364
Wait to turn this on. The satellite's
only good for the next 72 hours.

523
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,281
Let's hope that's more than we need.

524
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:24,599
All right, set us up.
You know the drill.

525
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:26,885
- Hey, what's in that bag?
- Spy stuff.

526
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:29,763
Rule number one:
Always have a sure way out.

527
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,124
- Hey, Rachel.
- What's up?

528
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:35,927
It's weird. It feels like
a stakeout, doesn't it?

529
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,683
No. Not really.

530
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,524
And we are live.

531
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:09,038
Hey, what's that for?

532
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:13,646
This is how I'm gonna break
this case wide open with your help.

533
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,845
It's a replica of the pen
Gundars carries.

534
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,477
There's an IHB
tracking device built in.

535
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:19,923
Technology.

536
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:23,081
If Alex can plant it on him,
we can follow his movements.

537
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:25,922
Okay. Let's do this, then.

538
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:30,285
Nice shifting, Rachel. These
stick shifts can be a little tricky.

539
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,599
You make it look easy.

540
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,326
Thank you.

541
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:39,484
Please tell me you didn't
say, "nice shifting."

542
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,322
- Don't worry about it.
- You really like that girl, huh?

543
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:44,241
- Rachel? No.
- Yes, you do.

544
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:46,044
- Mr. Robinson!
- Hey.

545
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:47,198
- Welcome!
- Hey.

546
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:49,837
- I am very big fan.
- How you doing? You a fan too?

547
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:53,365
It's going around, baby. How you
doing? Kelly Robinson, 57 and 0.

548
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,645
- You got that?
- No, no, no, I'm with him.

549
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:59,484
Kelly! Tell these guys
I'm with you. I'm with the boxer.

550
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:02,721
I've never seen that man before.
Shoot him in his ass.

551
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,403
- Hey, no, he's...
- I'm just playing. It's a joke.

552
00:32:05,569 --> 00:32:08,561
Don't shoot the guy. He's with me.
Sorry about that, guys.

553
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:10,048
That's a bad start.

554
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,769
That's revenge for the hotel.
Now we're even.

555
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,363
Okay, you did your job.
Now let me do mine.

556
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:21,480
Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Yeah. Yeah.

557
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,765
Kelly Robinson, y'all, in the flesh.

558
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:28,441
Y'all looking at the fastest man in the
world! Y'all can do better than that!

559
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:32,922
Y'all ready for the Slugfest
in Budapest? That's good.

560
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:34,317
Yeah! How y'all doing?

561
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:37,208
Hello, Mr. Robinson.
This is great honour to meet you.

562
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,248
Hey, look, it's an honour for me to let
you meet me. How about that, huh?

563
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:43,445
All right, good meeting you.
Take it easy.

564
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,600
I like him. I like the way he talks.

565
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:48,647
- You just met Marwan Motaheeshi.
- Who's that?

566
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:53,439
He controls death squads. They kill
thousands of people every year.

567
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,327
Man.

568
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:59,007
- All right, here he comes.
- Okay, that's Gundars?

569
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:01,808
- That's a bad-ass jacket he got on.
- Turn around.

570
00:33:01,969 --> 00:33:04,278
- Yeah, okay.
- Disappear. Get away.

571
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,441
- I won't disappear. I'll do the pen.
- Give me the pen. Give...

572
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:10,123
- Back up before...
- Mr. Robinson. Good to meet you.

573
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,961
Mr. Gundars, the pleasure's mine.

574
00:33:12,129 --> 00:33:15,565
Thank you. Your fight here promises
to be the most exciting event...

575
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:17,799
...that Budapest has seen
in some time.

576
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:19,448
Since you such a nice guy...

577
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:21,839
...I ain't gonna break
your boy up too bad.

578
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:23,328
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

579
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:25,559
- Mr. Robinson, your champagne.
- Thank you.

580
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:29,358
I'm sorry to interrupt you. One
of the ladies wants an autograph.

581
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:33,124
No problem at all, but
you have a pen I could use?

582
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:34,558
I don't.

583
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:37,084
Didn't I tell you at all times
to keep a pen?

584
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:39,683
- I apologize.
- My assistant's penless.

585
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,522
- It won't happen again.
- I said to have a pen...

586
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,203
Mr. Gundars.
Mr. Gundars is always prepared.

587
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:50,602
Thank you. Hold this champagne.
You have to be prepared.

588
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:52,725
I'm disappointed,
I want you to know.

589
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:54,959
Take that. Here you go.

590
00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:00,480
Clown ass. It's hard to get somebody
that'll do their job the right way.

591
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:05,200
I'm sorry about that. Force of habit.
Here's your pen, Mr. Gundars.

592
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:10,682
- Well, enjoy the party.
- Yeah.

593
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,840
Nice to see you.
I have some business.

594
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,807
Take care of your business.
Take care of your business.

595
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,085
Hey, you a real player.

596
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:20,717
Gundars.

597
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:23,564
I had it under control
until you showed up.

598
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,082
I know you did.

599
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:28,127
Okay, he's taking off.
I need you to create a distraction.

600
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:30,678
Create a distraction?
What do you mean? Do what?

601
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:33,886
Make a scene or do something.
That should come easy for you.

602
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:36,040
Make a scene?

603
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:39,444
Yeah! Baddest man on the planet!

604
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:43,488
Cedric Mills, where you at? Come on,
everybody. Cedric, where you at?

605
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:46,083
Let's get a show going here.
Where's Cedric Mills?

606
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,285
Everybody gather around.
Hey, come on.

607
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,566
Break that up. Come on,
y'all look great, but get out the ring.

608
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:54,562
It's about me and Cedric.
Cedric Mills, where you at?

609
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:56,367
Hey, Cedric! You in the house?

610
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,645
I know I seen you!
There you go, Cedric.

611
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:02,165
What you doing down there?
Having a steroid cocktail?

612
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:03,808
I do not take the steroids.

613
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,358
You need something
if you get in the ring with me.

614
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,121
Let's give the people a preview.

615
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:10,439
Don't be scared.
I ain't gonna hurt you.

616
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:15,524
Cedric Mills, everybody! In the flesh!
That's a brave man there.

617
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:17,202
That's like swimming with Jaws.

618
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:23,882
Well. Are you ready?

619
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:26,244
I want to see the plane first.

620
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:29,401
Only the highest bidder
will have that privilege.

621
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:32,447
Is it really invisible?

622
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:35,882
How long have you been
in Budapest?

623
00:35:36,049 --> 00:35:38,438
- Three days.
- Three days.

624
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:42,124
Well, you've probably driven past it
at least half a dozen times.

625
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:45,964
Now, if you'd enter your
bid into the computer.

626
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:56,327
I usually make the predictions,
but let's do a little flip.

627
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:02,166
Let's let Cedric make the predictions.
What round will I knock you out in?

628
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,478
Hey, you stop jokes now.

629
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:05,008
- Or what?
- I will!

630
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:09,401
You gonna stop...? Isn't he a doll?
"I will stop them!" I like that.

631
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:13,084
Give them a preview. Open-handed.
Let's see how fast you are.

632
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:16,127
Y'all like to see that, wouldn't you?
Open-handed scrap?

633
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:20,328
Put your hands up. What you got?
That's what you coming with?

634
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,207
You're gonna get your ass whipped.

635
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:24,485
I'll hit your jaw.
Right jaw with left hand.

636
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:28,437
Put your guard up, now. I'm pretty
fast, now. You ready? Here it come.

637
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:31,567
I told you I would slap you.
Why didn't you block the punch?

638
00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:34,323
What's wrong with you,
coming all hard like that?

639
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:37,447
You're supposed to give them
a taste. You wanna hit me hard.

640
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,884
What if I kick your ass
in front of everybody?

641
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:41,528
There you go! A preview.

642
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:44,999
Robinson vs. Mills.
The transatlantic championship...

643
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,524
...tomorrow night, here in Budapest.

644
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:52,287
- Done.
- Excellent.

645
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:55,961
Well, the best of luck.

646
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:57,960
Thank you.

647
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:02,840
Would you care for champagne?
We have an excellent fountain.

648
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:03,998
Yes.

649
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:06,922
An undetectable
nuclear delivery system...

650
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,684
...could transform your tiny
country into a superpower.

651
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:44,243
What you doing, hanging
from the ceiling like that?

652
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,877
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be outside.

653
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:49,563
- I figured you'd need help.
- Don't walk in here.

654
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:51,799
Don't tell me what to do.
I'm Kelly Robinson.

655
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,563
57 and 0. Don't talk to me like that.
What's wrong?

656
00:37:54,729 --> 00:37:56,879
You tripped the alarm.
Yeah, you tripped it.

657
00:37:57,049 --> 00:37:59,119
I didn't trip no alarm.
I don't hear it.

658
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:01,245
See this?

659
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,640
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, oh, shit. Come here.

660
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:06,562
We'll get caught because
you didn't tell me about the alarm.

661
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,321
- This is your fault.
- Put that on.

662
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:10,445
- What is this?
- It's a mask. Put it on.

663
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:12,440
- This look like a sock.
- It's a mask.

664
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:14,327
It's a special spy mask. Put it on.

665
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:16,127
Look like a sock.

666
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:18,325
Hey, man, this is a sock!
What you doing?

667
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:20,047
Putting this on.
Let me do this.

668
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,198
Quit tickling me.

669
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:22,558
Would you come here?

670
00:38:22,729 --> 00:38:25,243
- Just tell me what's going on.
- I am losing it.

671
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,479
I'm nervous and ticklish
at the same time.

672
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:31,119
Not in my wildest imagination did
I dream it would be this difficult.

673
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:35,123
Before you enter your bid,
Mr. Abi, let me remind you...

674
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:37,723
...that an undetectable
nuclear delivery system...

675
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:39,208
- Why we spinning?
- Be still.

676
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:41,599
- Don't breathe.
- We can't spin like this.

677
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:43,646
- It's cracking.
- I'm getting queasy...

678
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:47,961
...and I don't like heights. And I'm
spinning, and I'm gonna vomit.

679
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:53,879
What kind of cheap-ass equipment
they send you on this mission with?

680
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:56,609
- The anchor broke.
- You check the anchor first.

681
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:59,522
I wasn't expecting you to be here.

682
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:00,918
Hey, that's cool.

683
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,000
The funds will be verified
overnight...

684
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:05,683
...and the highest bidder
will be informed tomorrow.

685
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:08,363
I would like you to enjoy
our local specialty.

686
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:11,327
Sir? Sir.

687
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:15,646
The silent alarm has just been
set off.

688
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:20,328
Please, I need a few moments alone.

689
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:22,081
- What about my bid?
- Don't worry.

690
00:39:22,249 --> 00:39:24,604
You'll get your chance. Enjoy.

691
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,839
Lock the door.

692
00:39:36,049 --> 00:39:37,243
Get on the roof.

693
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,969
- Just go through the opening.
- Don't make me fall.

694
00:39:40,129 --> 00:39:43,007
- Go through it.
- Lock this wing down.

695
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:46,799
I was born semipsychic, and I had
a hunch something would happen.

696
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:50,006
- Then why'd you go into the room?
- I ain't Miss Cleo.

697
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,720
They are on the dome.

698
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:57,199
It's like you're a double agent.
Like you're working against me.

699
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:59,007
Just get them. Now.

700
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,158
Oh, man!

701
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:12,887
- I liked this better when it was a test!
- We gotta jump!

702
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:14,960
What?

703
00:40:15,129 --> 00:40:17,484
- You crazy? I ain't jumping.
- Got a better idea?

704
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:20,482
No, but you better
come up with something.

705
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:22,526
Okay, new plan. Wait right here.

706
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:24,407
What you gonna do?
Don't leave me.

707
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:26,719
- What's that?
- What?

708
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:29,527
Oh, God!

709
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:38,244
- Okay, that wasn't that bad.
- What'd I say? Are your legs numb?

710
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:40,479
No, come on. Let's do it.
What's next?

711
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:44,165
Rule number one: Always have
a sure way out. Walk, walk, walk.

712
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:48,561
- Hey! You guys!
- Run, run. Now we run. Now we run.

713
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:05,761
- This is your sure way out?
- It's the way to the sure way out.

714
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:09,524
- Go through it.
- Come on, man!

715
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:20,446
Could you move? Look out.
Lose the jacket!

716
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:24,162
Are we still on the way
to the sure way, or is this it?

717
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:25,921
This is the sure way out.

718
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:28,239
Okay. Come on.

719
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:29,888
It's slow. I'm nervous.

720
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:32,085
- Don't panic.
- Look how slow we moving!

721
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:39,843
Kelly, it's here.
We are home free, my friend.

722
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:41,362
There's a guy coming.

723
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,167
Kick him.
Kick him in the balls!

724
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:45,126
How I'm gonna kick him
if he got a gun?

725
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:49,248
- Don't be defeatist! Stay on my side!
- Hey, watch out!

726
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:56,440
They're gonna kill Kelly Robinson.

727
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:58,839
Don't be negative.
Check outside!

728
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:00,601
Hey, that guy's still coming.

729
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,566
I'm gonna get him.
I'm gonna get him.

730
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,003
- Tell me when. Now?
- No!

731
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:06,967
- Now?
- Now!

732
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:10,039
- Okay.
- Throw it. Lob it over there!

733
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:12,040
- What's this?
- Smoke grenade.

734
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:14,677
- They got bullets and we got smoke?
- Lob it!

735
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:19,640
It's smoking.

736
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:22,207
- Now what?
- Here. Grab this.

737
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:29,600
I knew you had something
up your sleeve.

738
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:31,487
- Of course.
- I never doubted you.

739
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:35,005
- That's right.
- Yeah. All right. Okay.

740
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:37,239
How we gonna
get down from here?

741
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:39,969
I don't think we're gonna have
to worry about that.

742
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:44,168
Okay, you worried now?

743
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:46,206
I'm a little worried now.

744
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:49,247
We'll bring her gently down
on that grassy hill there.

745
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:51,559
We're going down faster than I want.

746
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:52,923
Get ready!
Brace yourself!

747
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:54,522
What?

748
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:00,724
Hey, what happened
to the soft, grassy hill?

749
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:02,845
We missed it.

750
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:09,283
Let go when I say so.

751
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:11,280
Hey, man, I'm not letting go.

752
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:13,644
You wanna die?
We've dodged some bullets...

753
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:17,085
...and I don't know how many more
lives we've got. We gotta let go.

754
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:19,643
Ready?

755
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:22,164
Get set. Let go!

756
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:24,768
I broke my leg. It's broken.

757
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:27,841
That's what your ass gets
for this crazy balloon shit.

758
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:29,920
Kelly Robinson
hanging from a balloon.

759
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:34,048
- No, it's okay. It's okay.
- I wish it was broke.

760
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:43,808
- They're still coming.
- Man, these guys won't give up.

761
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:46,244
- Now what?
- I wish that balloon worked better.

762
00:43:46,409 --> 00:43:48,559
The balloon is over!
What are we gonna do?

763
00:43:48,729 --> 00:43:50,003
Let me think. Hold on.

764
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,444
I got an idea. Move around.
Get in the car.

765
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:54,839
You've got an idea?
This I want to see.

766
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:57,045
Now you be in the hot seat.

767
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:07,326
I used to be in a different business.

768
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:09,957
- What are you doing?
- They keep the keys here. See?

769
00:44:10,129 --> 00:44:13,644
- What? You used to transport cars?
- Something like that.

770
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:17,122
Here we go.

771
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:38,361
You did it.
Show them something there.

772
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:42,525
- Hey!
- Okay, I got an idea.

773
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:44,805
- What you gonna do?
- You inspired me.

774
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:48,002
We're gonna try a little Carlos.

775
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:52,881
- What are you doing?
- Pull forward.

776
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:55,319
- What?
- Pull forward.

777
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:03,365
- Did you see that?
- Goddamn!

778
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:06,566
- That was a big explosion.
- Man!

779
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:14,043
That's why they think Carlos
is a better spy than me!

780
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:16,120
- Carlos?
- Everyone thinks he's great.

781
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:18,962
- He's got more potent bombs.
- His bombs are more potent?

782
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:20,448
That ain't right.

783
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:21,962
Another one!
Here they come.

784
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:23,118
This one's mine.

785
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:26,361
Let me show you something they
don't teach over at the BNS.

786
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,646
Oh, wow. That's pretty good.

787
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:45,722
- You were unbelievable back there.
- That was you.

788
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:49,928
You had the thing going down, the
Kelly Robinson... I had one little bomb.

789
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:51,807
- Little bomb?
- It was like...

790
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:53,561
- You're crazy.
- Here they are.

791
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:05,083
- Good driving.
- Kelly Robinson, Kelly Robinson.

792
00:46:08,929 --> 00:46:10,203
What we got here?

793
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:12,280
Hey, no outlet in here.
We stuck, man.

794
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:16,601
Hey, pull over here. Pull right here.
Stop, stop, stop. Give me the keys.

795
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:19,966
Look what I got! Keys!
Convertible. It's all yours.

796
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:22,518
You take that car.
We'll take your scooter.

797
00:46:22,689 --> 00:46:24,088
Jump on. Jump on!

798
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:27,047
Kelly Robinson ain't getting on
no scooter like no bitch.

799
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,445
All right. Okay, let's do it.
Come on, man.

800
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:32,442
Get your feet up.
Okay. Hold on!

801
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:42,445
- Hold on. Okay, hold on.
- I am holding on.

802
00:46:46,649 --> 00:46:48,287
Shit!

803
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:53,248
Go, go, go!

804
00:46:57,569 --> 00:47:00,163
- It's a nightmare!
- Yeah, it's a nightmare.

805
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:02,604
They shooting, and I'm in the back.

806
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:08,000
- Better come up with something.
- We'll make a break for daylight.

807
00:47:08,169 --> 00:47:10,080
Tuck your elbows in.

808
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:33,122
What's that smell?
Oh, man.

809
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:35,325
Go down the tunnel.

810
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:40,123
- This is the sewer!
- We're stuck. Is there an opening?

811
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:42,803
There's bars and shit over here.
We can't get out.

812
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:44,607
Just stand back to the side.

813
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:46,919
Oh, shit!

814
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:50,005
You okay?

815
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:54,128
I made $24 million last year, and I'm
standing in a river of human sludge.

816
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:55,358
You ask me, am I okay!

817
00:47:55,529 --> 00:47:58,999
You made $24 million last year?

818
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:00,727
Yeah, 24.7.

819
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:06,208
- They ain't leaving.
- It's late night.

820
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:09,725
- We'll wait them out.
- Shit, it stinks down here.

821
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:11,800
Just don't breathe in too deep.

822
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:14,847
Methane.
Methane'll make you loopy.

823
00:48:15,009 --> 00:48:19,241
I'm gonna get loopy from standing
and breathing in this human...

824
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:21,240
You know what this is, right?

825
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:24,879
This is the nastiest place
in all of Hungary.

826
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:27,085
You feeling loopy? You look loopy.

827
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:31,288
Yes. It feels kind of dizzy.
I got a buzz.

828
00:48:33,129 --> 00:48:34,926
Okay.

829
00:48:35,689 --> 00:48:37,725
- Where'd you grow up?
- Hey, man...

830
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:41,199
...no offence, but I ain't one
of those guys that, you know...

831
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:44,600
...start pouring his heart out
and get personal with another guy...

832
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:47,841
...so save it for somebody else.

833
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,728
My grandmother raised me.
My grandmother.

834
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:51,878
No kidding?

835
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:54,438
Yeah, she's the one
that put the time in.

836
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:57,726
The day-to-day, you know,
feeding, and you know.

837
00:48:57,889 --> 00:48:59,242
Sounds like a sweet woman.

838
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:04,039
Sweet! The sweetest thing
you ever wanna meet.

839
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:08,646
Angel. My grandmother's the first
person ever punched me in the face.

840
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:12,404
None of that hard shit, a jab,
just to let me know she was serious.

841
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:14,321
Parents don't take the time anymore.

842
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:16,923
No, that's love, you know.
I mean, only...

843
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:20,001
You got to love somebody's baby
to punch a baby in the face.

844
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:24,560
Kelly Robinson was a scared little
boy. That's all. A scared little boy.

845
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:26,367
Keep going. Keep digging.

846
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:31,205
I mean, I put on a show, but inside,
man, lots of time I be crying.

847
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:37,723
You ready for a bomb?

848
00:49:38,129 --> 00:49:39,357
Tell me.

849
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:41,804
You and I are basically
the same guy.

850
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:44,881
Take away the boxing,
take away the money...

851
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:46,198
Take away my money?

852
00:49:46,689 --> 00:49:48,884
It's a metaphor.

853
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:51,961
Take away all your women.

854
00:49:52,129 --> 00:49:56,884
Take away all the trappings
of success.

855
00:49:57,049 --> 00:49:58,846
And you and I are the same guy.

856
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:02,361
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, I know. I know. I'm you.

857
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:06,238
- No, I'm you.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

858
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:09,242
We're twins.

859
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:14,808
Oh, I've got a crush
on Rachel for years.

860
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:17,085
I just love her power.

861
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:20,002
And sexy and... You saw
the way she threw me over.

862
00:50:20,169 --> 00:50:22,808
It was just like I was nothing.
Just a powerful woman.

863
00:50:23,129 --> 00:50:27,202
You know what? I'll tell you what.
If you feel that way about a girl...

864
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:29,519
...then you got to act on it.
- Oh, I do.

865
00:50:29,689 --> 00:50:31,805
You see how it is when I try
to talk to her.

866
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,925
- You gotta...
- Fumbling over myself...

867
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:35,807
I see, but you need to change that.

868
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:39,484
- Be honest. We're in the sewer.
- Hey, I ain't gonna lie to you. What?

869
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:43,005
I don't have the savoir-faire,
that devilish charm.

870
00:50:43,169 --> 00:50:46,479
- I've seen you, and I don't have that.
- I beg to differ. I disagree.

871
00:50:46,649 --> 00:50:49,243
No, I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to your...

872
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:51,684
Bust it, bust it.
You do have savoir-faire.

873
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:54,886
You just have to unleash it.

874
00:50:55,289 --> 00:51:00,682
Unleash it.
Unleash your savoir-faire.

875
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:02,687
I don't know.

876
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:08,128
You know, if you forget that this is a
sewer, it's kind of a beautiful place.

877
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:21,406
Thank God! What happened?
I thought you two were dead.

878
00:51:21,569 --> 00:51:23,878
- Gundars' men had us pinned.
- Did they see you?

879
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:25,721
No. Have you been tracking
the pen?

880
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:27,925
It's at the palace.
He moved until 1:30...

881
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:30,762
...and it's been in the bedroom
since. He's not onto us.

882
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:33,124
Let us know, Jim, the minute
that pen moves.

883
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:36,440
The plane is still in Budapest,
but the deal's going down today.

884
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:38,201
Bob, get a helicopter in the air.

885
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:41,520
Scan every rooftop, parking lot,
playground in the city.

886
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:44,078
UV, infrared, throw
everything you got at it.

887
00:51:44,649 --> 00:51:47,038
We're on it.

888
00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:52,444
Just zoom in on it.

889
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,883
Rachel, you look bad.

890
00:51:56,769 --> 00:52:00,603
Tired. You must be exhausted.

891
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:01,758
What a night.

892
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:04,159
I was driving around,
looking for you all night.

893
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,480
Why don't you go take a nap?
We'll give a yell if the pen moves.

894
00:52:07,649 --> 00:52:09,128
Sure you guys can handle this?

895
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:12,645
You've been working hard. I'm sure
he got this covered. Take a nap.

896
00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:16,688
All right, maybe I will for a sec,
but call me if anything happens.

897
00:52:17,249 --> 00:52:18,238
I'm glad you're okay.

898
00:52:18,529 --> 00:52:20,599
All right. Thank you.

899
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:24,919
Oh, yeah.

900
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:28,002
I know what you thinking,
and the answer is yes, playboy.

901
00:52:28,169 --> 00:52:30,842
- Yes. You going in there.
- I'm not going in there.

902
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:33,477
You are going, and you gonna be
devilishly charming.

903
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:36,766
- This isn't one of your floozies.
- It's a girl. A girl's a girl.

904
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:39,159
She's special. You gotta
put her on a pedestal.

905
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:42,526
Well, we don't have a pedestal.
All we got is a cot in the back.

906
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:45,240
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- No, today...

907
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:47,639
...right now on the cot in the back.

908
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:49,401
- I don't know.
- I do know.

909
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:51,400
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

910
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:53,924
I know you in a good mood now.
Let's do it.

911
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:58,687
You can be charming as hell.
I'll show you how we'll do it.

912
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:01,807
I'm gonna unleash
your savoir-faire.

913
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:07,084
Hey, it's me, Alex.

914
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:09,127
Alex?

915
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:10,723
I love the way
you say my name.

916
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:12,959
It's the way the L
flicks off your tongue...

917
00:53:13,129 --> 00:53:14,687
...when you say
the L in Alex.

918
00:53:14,849 --> 00:53:18,046
It's like the way the L
flicks off your tongue.

919
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:21,121
It's like, "Alex, Alex, Alex."

920
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:25,202
Say it one more time for me.
Just let me hear you say it.

921
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,688
What are you doing?

922
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:32,641
What am I doing?
I'm just...

923
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,642
I'm getting ready to make love
to you so good and long...

924
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:39,165
...you'll be begging me to stop
and keep going at the same time.

925
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,765
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

926
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:44,439
I'm getting ready to...

927
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:50,041
Baby, I'm gonna make
sure that you're okay.

928
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:53,281
Now that I see that you are,
you're all tucked in, doing fine...

929
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:57,044
...l'm gonna go back out. Everything's
fine here. Don't worry about us.

930
00:53:57,209 --> 00:54:00,121
Go back to sleep. Don't...
Forget I came in. I'll just...

931
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:03,964
That's not what I said. Hey!
Get back in there!

932
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:06,689
No!
Your rap's not working.

933
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:09,283
Try tomorrow. We did our best.
No shame in that.

934
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:12,964
Kelly Robinson's rap works! Get your
ass back there. This is good shit.

935
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:15,763
Give me...

936
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:19,968
Hey, I'm just... I'm sorry
to keep barging in like this.

937
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:21,482
I just wanna...

938
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:24,846
Let me just take a...
Just collect myself for a second.

939
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:28,046
I have something that I want
to say, and if you don't mind...

940
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:29,881
...I just have a...

941
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:32,404
It's like a story that I feel
I need to tell you.

942
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,003
That's good. I'm gonna
give you my secret weapon.

943
00:54:35,169 --> 00:54:37,080
This shit always works.
Now listen, now.

944
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:38,523
Look in her eyes.

945
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:42,168
Now sing.

946
00:54:49,169 --> 00:54:50,158
Say that.

947
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,126
Baby, when I woke up
this morning...

948
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,167
...I felt like there was a sea
storming inside of me.

949
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:57,398
Inside of me.

950
00:55:04,129 --> 00:55:06,359
And baby...

951
00:55:06,609 --> 00:55:09,407
...I think I'm capsizing.

952
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:13,403
I think I'm capsizing,
and the waves just keep rising.

953
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:18,521
Rising. Rising and...

954
00:55:24,729 --> 00:55:26,924
When I get that feeling...

955
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:32,998
...I need sexual healing.
I just need it. I just need it.

956
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:35,729
Sexual... I know,
it sounds crazy. I'm just...

957
00:55:35,889 --> 00:55:40,724
I'm probably delirious,
but it just makes me feel so fine.

958
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:43,802
And it's good for us.

959
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:51,362
It's sexual.
It's healing. Okay?

960
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:54,005
I don't know what else
I can say.

961
00:55:54,169 --> 00:55:55,648
You're cute.

962
00:55:56,529 --> 00:55:58,485
I've always had
a little crush on you.

963
00:55:58,649 --> 00:56:00,719
- I told you!
- Really? You did?

964
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:05,277
- I'm hot. It's hot in here, isn't it?
- My gosh.

965
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,280
Good Lord.

966
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:11,922
Shit, yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

967
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:15,486
Now go over there, and
bite her on the ass real hard.

968
00:56:15,649 --> 00:56:16,764
- No!
- Yes!

969
00:56:16,929 --> 00:56:19,204
- No, no, no, no.
- No?

970
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:20,802
No, no, no, no.
Yes to you.

971
00:56:20,969 --> 00:56:22,368
- Yes?
- Bite her. Bite her!

972
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:23,518
- No!
- No?

973
00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:26,203
No, yes.
Go back to where you were.

974
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:29,088
- I'm just... I'm...
- Bite! Bite! Bite her!

975
00:56:29,569 --> 00:56:30,843
They love that shit.

976
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:35,487
Don't break the skin, but bite it good
so that there's a mark on her ass.

977
00:56:35,649 --> 00:56:38,766
She'll show all her friends.
"Look at my mark, what he did."

978
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:41,767
I know what you want.

979
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:48,559
It's okay.
You can trust me.

980
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:58,203
- My...
- You okay?

981
00:56:58,369 --> 00:57:01,122
I think you broke my spine.

982
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:04,758
But in a good way.

983
00:57:11,489 --> 00:57:12,888
Hey!

984
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:16,800
Hey, come on, now.
Let me at least see the goods.

985
00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:21,679
Hey, the pen just moved!
Let's go!

986
00:57:21,889 --> 00:57:23,800
Let's move!
Gotta go! Let's go!

987
00:57:24,209 --> 00:57:25,244
- Pen moved.
- No.

988
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,479
- Are you sure?
- Come on. Yes.

989
00:57:35,049 --> 00:57:38,200
It looks like he's out of the car
and headed for the baths.

990
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:40,166
Wait. Why is he
going to the baths?

991
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:42,843
As long as he's not going
to a pen store, who cares?

992
00:57:43,009 --> 00:57:45,603
Stakeout. Stakeout.
Stakeout, guys.

993
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,487
This needs a stakeout.

994
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:04,286
- I'll take the back, okay?
- Wait a second. Be careful.

995
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:07,281
You too, okay?

996
00:58:10,129 --> 00:58:12,563
Please. Come on, man.
Come on.

997
00:58:12,729 --> 00:58:16,119
You realize I can save the world
and make boxing history in one day?

998
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:18,200
- All right.
- They'll give me a parade.

999
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,837
Ticker-tape parade.
Confetti and all that shit.

1000
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:23,125
Bigass parade.
Glitter.

1001
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:24,438
Get my own day.

1002
00:58:25,729 --> 00:58:28,960
Kelly Day.
Kelly Robinson Day parade.

1003
00:58:30,169 --> 00:58:32,000
Nasty as hell up in here.

1004
00:58:32,169 --> 00:58:34,729
It smells like ass soup
all over the place.

1005
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,085
- I just lost the signal.
- What?

1006
00:58:37,249 --> 00:58:39,604
Maybe the walls
are too thick in here.

1007
00:58:40,009 --> 00:58:42,284
No, no. Something's wrong.
Come on.

1008
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:45,122
We can't walk away from this.
We got to get that plane!

1009
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:48,520
You're fired up. I like your
enthusiasm, don't wanna lose it.

1010
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:51,999
But sometimes you move forward,
sometimes back. We're moving back.

1011
00:58:52,169 --> 00:58:53,682
Hell, no! Listen to me.

1012
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:56,409
I told you I was semipsychic.
I got a hunch on this.

1013
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:59,208
Seven out of 10 of my hunches
are correct. That's a high ratio!

1014
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,327
We got to go with them numbers.
Like, here, in this area...

1015
00:59:02,489 --> 00:59:05,561
...l'm vibing this. Right now,
I know the plane is in here.

1016
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:07,082
Trust me on this.
Hey!

1017
00:59:07,249 --> 00:59:09,205
What you know
about the Leafy Bug?

1018
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:11,202
What?

1019
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:15,638
- Kick your ass if I find it in here.
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

1020
00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:18,398
Hell, yeah. Come on, now.
You don't feel that?

1021
00:59:18,569 --> 00:59:21,800
- There's nothing in here.
- You must be crazy. I feel something.

1022
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:23,766
A lot of old guys
hitting each other with sticks.

1023
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:26,204
There's something else.
I feel it.

1024
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:29,441
Something's going on in here.
Something's definitely going on.

1025
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,758
What's your name, boy?

1026
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:34,967
He talking all that shit
because he knows something.

1027
00:59:35,129 --> 00:59:36,608
Something's in here.
I feel it.

1028
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:39,408
You know what?
We learned we can't trust your gut.

1029
00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:41,161
You can trust my gut.
I told you...

1030
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:44,765
Maybe the plane's over there
in the whirlpool. We should check...

1031
00:59:44,929 --> 00:59:47,284
- Maybe those three out of 10...
- Gun!

1032
00:59:56,729 --> 00:59:59,641
- You said there was a plane!
- I said, a vibe! A vibe!

1033
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:00,958
Like a fool, I listened!

1034
01:00:05,609 --> 01:00:07,008
You got a way out of here?

1035
01:00:07,169 --> 01:00:09,729
I followed you in here.
Why would I have a way out?

1036
01:00:15,489 --> 01:00:18,526
- What are you shooting at?
- Trying to hit the pipes.

1037
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:23,361
Throw this up there. We'll create
a spark. When I say ready. Go!

1038
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:28,447
I got it. I got it.

1039
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:31,924
It's gonna blow.
It's gonna blow!

1040
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,560
We gotta warn Rachel.

1041
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:04,923
There goes Gundars!

1042
01:01:05,409 --> 01:01:07,001
Rachel!

1043
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:08,962
Rachel, no!

1044
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,001
It's a setup!

1045
01:01:14,529 --> 01:01:15,928
No! No!

1046
01:01:23,169 --> 01:01:25,080
Man!

1047
01:01:28,969 --> 01:01:30,527
Let's go.

1048
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:35,802
- That's it?
- Yeah, Kelly, that's it.

1049
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:39,601
Shit!

1050
01:01:42,089 --> 01:01:43,761
- You all right?
- What do you think?

1051
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:46,238
I think you're messed up,
and you need to talk.

1052
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:48,206
Is that what you think?
Rachel's dead!

1053
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:50,564
She's dead because I've been
listening to you. I'm done.

1054
01:01:50,729 --> 01:01:52,799
You're upset.
Rachel was a good woman.

1055
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:55,608
She was a good woman,
and she's gone.

1056
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:57,566
You're still here, though,
semipsychic guy.

1057
01:01:57,729 --> 01:02:00,289
Wait. You ain't blaming
that back there on me.

1058
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:02,963
No. Who could blame you?
It's not your fault.

1059
01:02:03,129 --> 01:02:05,927
You're the king of the universe.
You want Kelly Robinson Day.

1060
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,842
- Have the parade. You'll get it.
- Slow it down. Back off.

1061
01:02:09,009 --> 01:02:10,840
I don't like your tone. You fixing
to get your ass whipped.

1062
01:02:11,009 --> 01:02:13,079
Really? Is that
one of your hunches?

1063
01:02:13,249 --> 01:02:15,479
Or some of the normal crap
that comes out of your mouth?

1064
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:18,038
Remember what I said
about how we're the same guy?

1065
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:20,279
I'm not you.
Thank God, I'm not you!

1066
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:22,838
- I would hate to be you.
- All right.

1067
01:02:23,009 --> 01:02:26,126
That's the last straw.
I got to whup your ass now.

1068
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,280
- You wanna fight me?
- I'll whip your ass!

1069
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:30,838
Let me take off my jacket.
This is gonna amuse me.

1070
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:33,569
If going to the dentist is amusing,
then this is getting ready to be funny.

1071
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:36,323
- There's no ref here.
- I don't need no referee.

1072
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:39,640
From this position, I know 11 ways
I can totally immobilize you.

1073
01:02:39,809 --> 01:02:41,037
End your life right...

1074
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:43,120
How much from that position?
Huh?

1075
01:02:43,289 --> 01:02:44,278
That was my left.

1076
01:02:44,449 --> 01:02:47,327
If it was my right, you'd be
drinking meat through a straw.

1077
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:51,327
Will you look at surfer boy!

1078
01:02:51,489 --> 01:02:52,968
Show me some good spy shit.

1079
01:02:53,129 --> 01:02:54,118
Hey, shit!

1080
01:02:55,649 --> 01:02:59,005
If that had gone 6 inches higher,
you'd be in a coma right now.

1081
01:03:00,729 --> 01:03:01,923
You okay?

1082
01:03:02,089 --> 01:03:06,685
You know how to use your feet good.
Throw kicks like a little bitch!

1083
01:03:12,129 --> 01:03:13,608
You got me!

1084
01:03:13,769 --> 01:03:15,725
Hands up! What's going on here?

1085
01:03:15,969 --> 01:03:17,880
The black guy!
The black guy mugged me!

1086
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:22,005
I'd like to file a complaint!
Wait!

1087
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:24,444
Why am I being arrested?
Why am I being arrested?

1088
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:27,965
This is bullshit! He kicked me first!
He kicked me in my nuts!

1089
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:31,326
Why am I getting arrested
if I got kicked in my nuts?

1090
01:03:31,489 --> 01:03:34,959
How come you just arresting
the black man? My nuts was kicked!

1091
01:04:14,369 --> 01:04:15,484
- Yeah?
- Alex.

1092
01:04:15,649 --> 01:04:18,004
Where are you?
I've been calling for three hours!

1093
01:04:18,169 --> 01:04:20,125
I know.
We hit a few snags.

1094
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,928
Snags? I'm sending backup now.
What's your location?

1095
01:04:23,089 --> 01:04:24,681
- It's all fine.
- It's all fine?

1096
01:04:24,849 --> 01:04:28,603
I'm headed to the castle tonight.
I'll try to track Gundars to the plane.

1097
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:32,159
You don't know where it is yet?
I knew you'd screw this up. Look...

1098
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:35,002
I gotta go, Mac.
I gotta go.

1099
01:04:43,289 --> 01:04:44,847
Dude never been this late.

1100
01:04:45,009 --> 01:04:47,000
The brother can't tell time no more.
That's the problem.

1101
01:04:47,169 --> 01:04:50,320
- Kelly! Where you been?
- Better yet, who you been with?

1102
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:52,764
If you hang with us,
this shit wouldn't happen.

1103
01:04:52,929 --> 01:04:56,126
He ain't our problem no more.
Let's go down here and get 58.

1104
01:05:23,329 --> 01:05:26,560
Piece of shit microtracker.

1105
01:05:26,729 --> 01:05:28,606
You're a very lucky man,
Mr. Zhu Tam.

1106
01:05:28,769 --> 01:05:30,760
I feel like I just won the lottery.

1107
01:05:30,929 --> 01:05:34,717
It's funny, isn't it?
You winning makes me rich.

1108
01:05:35,209 --> 01:05:39,487
My government's point of view
is that no price is too high.

1109
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:40,877
Clearly.

1110
01:05:43,249 --> 01:05:45,080
So how's your golf game?

1111
01:05:45,249 --> 01:05:47,479
I haven't had much time
since I've been here.

1112
01:06:01,889 --> 01:06:03,481
In the 15th hole. Eagle.

1113
01:06:03,649 --> 01:06:05,321
- First time ever.
- Really?

1114
01:06:35,129 --> 01:06:36,642
Yeah! This is it, baby!

1115
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:42,201
Driver, take the car off the bridge,
away from the traffic.

1116
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:43,563
I don't see it.

1117
01:06:43,729 --> 01:06:46,926
That's the whole point, isn't it?
That you can't see it.

1118
01:06:47,089 --> 01:06:49,728
- That's what you're buying, isn't it?
- That's true.

1119
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:12,042
Thank you.

1120
01:07:15,049 --> 01:07:17,404
Wait a second.
Come on.

1121
01:07:19,129 --> 01:07:20,608
Is that...?

1122
01:07:21,729 --> 01:07:24,402
Please. Finally!

1123
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:26,403
Well.

1124
01:07:26,569 --> 01:07:28,287
Now you'll believe me
when I tell you...

1125
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:31,202
...that you've driven past it
half a dozen times.

1126
01:07:58,209 --> 01:08:01,201
It is the most incredible thing
I have ever seen.

1127
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,008
Shall we conclude our business?

1128
01:08:05,729 --> 01:08:07,481
Gentlemen, to the centre
of the ring.

1129
01:08:08,129 --> 01:08:10,518
I explained the instructions
in the dressing room.

1130
01:08:10,689 --> 01:08:12,281
You're both professional fighters.

1131
01:08:12,449 --> 01:08:14,838
I expect you to conduct
yourself professionally.

1132
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:17,559
- Shake hands.
- You ready to do this?

1133
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:18,957
Let's do it.

1134
01:08:25,129 --> 01:08:27,882
It looks like my computer
is a billion dollars healthier.

1135
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:29,960
Which makes you the proud owner...

1136
01:08:30,129 --> 01:08:33,166
...of the most advanced piece
of weaponry on the planet.

1137
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:35,927
Watch this.

1138
01:08:40,769 --> 01:08:42,839
The ignition code.

1139
01:08:51,809 --> 01:08:53,720
Round one
for the super middleweight...

1140
01:08:53,889 --> 01:08:56,323
...championship of the world!
- Cedric, come on.

1141
01:08:56,609 --> 01:08:58,998
Do you want the swelling
on the left or right?

1142
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:03,004
Mills goes right to work.

1143
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:07,487
Left hand up!
Left hand up!

1144
01:09:07,649 --> 01:09:08,764
He's spun around by...

1145
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:27,805
What are you doing?

1146
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:29,005
I'm working.

1147
01:09:51,409 --> 01:09:54,082
That looks like an old-fashioned
thermonuclear warhead.

1148
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:58,037
- It's a bit primitive, isn't it?
- They won't think so in Washington.

1149
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:15,320
Tell your men to drop their guns.

1150
01:10:15,489 --> 01:10:17,559
- Tell them!
- Do as he says.

1151
01:10:17,729 --> 01:10:19,321
Get your hands up!

1152
01:10:19,489 --> 01:10:21,445
You too, Mr. Zhu Tam.

1153
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:23,247
Do it!

1154
01:10:27,609 --> 01:10:30,362
You didn't think you could
fool BNS, did you?

1155
01:10:32,289 --> 01:10:34,325
- Rachel?
- I guess we did.

1156
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:37,879
- You're alive?
- Don't tell anyone.

1157
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:42,202
Robinson having his way.
Combination to the head.

1158
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:45,641
And a left hook jars the challenger.

1159
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:49,249
Here comes Robinson,
and here comes Mills.

1160
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:51,440
Body shots by the challenger, Mills.

1161
01:10:51,609 --> 01:10:54,681
Holding on to him.
Tying the champion up.

1162
01:10:56,449 --> 01:10:59,407
That was pretty convincing.
The whole "I'm dead" thing.

1163
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:01,241
You pick up a few tricks
over the years.

1164
01:11:01,409 --> 01:11:04,526
- You certainly do.
- You really should have caught it.

1165
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:06,202
Yeah, I should have.

1166
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:09,566
I guess I was a little distracted
by the sound of my heart breaking.

1167
01:11:11,649 --> 01:11:13,560
Code invalid.

1168
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:17,238
That's not good.
Is that good?

1169
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:20,401
- What the hell did you do?
- I entered the ignition code.

1170
01:11:20,569 --> 01:11:22,799
Self-destruct sequence
activated.

1171
01:11:23,129 --> 01:11:25,689
It has a self-destruct mechanism
if the wrong code is entered.

1172
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:30,525
No, that is the correct code. I saw
Lt. Percy fire the engine myself.

1173
01:11:30,689 --> 01:11:34,682
Just get it handled, Agent Wright.
That's what you're paid to do.

1174
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:40,038
He ain't done nothing
to earn your respect!

1175
01:11:40,209 --> 01:11:42,518
It's number 58 going down
right now. You hear?

1176
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:43,963
- How you feeling?
- 58.

1177
01:11:44,129 --> 01:11:45,767
- You good?
- Good, yeah.

1178
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:47,840
Damn! She may wanna
braid that.

1179
01:11:50,169 --> 01:11:52,729
And this world championship fight
rages on.

1180
01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:54,083
The code times out?

1181
01:11:54,249 --> 01:11:58,367
What, like a safety precaution?
In case the plane were stolen?

1182
01:11:58,529 --> 01:12:01,726
You're flying the plane home.
I assume you know the correct code.

1183
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:05,120
Assumptions have a way of coming
back and kicking you in your ass.

1184
01:12:07,049 --> 01:12:09,882
Robinson measuring Mills up.

1185
01:12:11,809 --> 01:12:14,403
A wicked left hook by Robinson.

1186
01:12:14,689 --> 01:12:17,408
- How much is he paying you?
- I don't have time for this.

1187
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:19,924
If I'd known you were for sale,
I would have bid!

1188
01:12:21,809 --> 01:12:23,162
I know that hurt.

1189
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:25,763
You got a hard-ass head.
Damn!

1190
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:28,238
The code, Alex.

1191
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:32,444
Come on, Cedric.

1192
01:12:34,209 --> 01:12:36,769
Robinson dancing around.
What's going on here?

1193
01:12:36,929 --> 01:12:39,489
It looks like he's fighting
an invisible opponent.

1194
01:12:46,049 --> 01:12:50,201
And down goes Robinson!
Unbelievable!

1195
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:53,247
Rachel, you're not getting
this plane off the bridge.

1196
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:56,361
Five. Six...

1197
01:12:56,529 --> 01:12:59,487
Kelly Robinson is down
for the first time in his career!

1198
01:12:59,649 --> 01:13:01,401
- Can you continue?
- I'm okay.

1199
01:13:01,569 --> 01:13:02,558
- Let's go.
- All right.

1200
01:13:02,729 --> 01:13:03,923
Let's go. Fight!

1201
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,760
Now it's gonna get messy.

1202
01:13:15,369 --> 01:13:17,007
It's time to go down.

1203
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,960
And Mills is down!

1204
01:13:22,129 --> 01:13:25,087
- Now we're talking!
- Five.

1205
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:26,807
- Come on, come on!
- Six.

1206
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,563
Seven. Eight. Nine.

1207
01:13:29,729 --> 01:13:32,118
- He's not gonna make it.
- Ten! You're out!

1208
01:13:32,289 --> 01:13:34,883
It's over!
Kelly Robinson is still...

1209
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:37,244
...the super middleweight
champion of the world!

1210
01:13:40,769 --> 01:13:44,045
Robinson foregoing his usual
flamboyant victory lap.

1211
01:13:44,209 --> 01:13:46,086
He bolts the ring.

1212
01:13:46,329 --> 01:13:48,968
I'm impressed, Alex.
You're tougher than I thought.

1213
01:13:49,129 --> 01:13:51,962
There's one thing that
will always make a man talk.

1214
01:13:57,649 --> 01:13:59,048
Cutting my belt?

1215
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:11,641
- Take off his pants.
- Take off my pants?

1216
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:13,879
Hold it.
Wait a second.

1217
01:14:25,649 --> 01:14:27,640
Easy. Easy.
Come on, take it easy.

1218
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:44,162
- What are you doing here?
- You turned on the eye thing...

1219
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:46,843
...so I had to come save your ass!
- I did?

1220
01:14:48,769 --> 01:14:52,159
That's a huge gesture!
That must mean you really love me.

1221
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:54,206
Don't get this twisted.
I did this to secure my parade!

1222
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:57,042
- No getting around it. You love me.
- This is for the parade!

1223
01:14:57,209 --> 01:14:58,198
- It's love!
- Parade!

1224
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,643
- It's love!
- Parade!

1225
01:14:59,849 --> 01:15:02,044
- Kelly Robinson Day parade!
- Move!

1226
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:08,081
I'm starting to regret this shit!

1227
01:15:08,929 --> 01:15:10,362
Move! Move!

1228
01:15:14,249 --> 01:15:15,602
Cover me!
Go!

1229
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:40,279
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1230
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:43,403
Who the hell is this guy?

1231
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:47,162
It's Carlos. I guess Mac
sent him in as backup for us.

1232
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:48,523
He's like a superspy.

1233
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:50,884
He's a spy, the same as me.
Not a superspy.

1234
01:15:51,049 --> 01:15:53,438
He got a fly-ass
ninja outfit and parachute.

1235
01:15:53,609 --> 01:15:54,883
We hanging from balloons
and shit.

1236
01:15:55,329 --> 01:15:58,162
Gundars! Tell your men
to put down their weapons.

1237
01:15:58,329 --> 01:16:00,399
It seems to be quite
a trend tonight. Down!

1238
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:03,208
Alex, the code
before we all blow up.

1239
01:16:03,369 --> 01:16:06,042
That's what I'm doing.
I was on my way to do it.

1240
01:16:06,209 --> 01:16:09,519
- Doing fine before you got here.
- Mr. Zhu Tam, I believe.

1241
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:11,645
Carlos, careful.
Rachel's a double agent!

1242
01:16:11,809 --> 01:16:14,243
Yes, I know, Alex.

1243
01:16:15,169 --> 01:16:17,285
Yours too, Rachel.

1244
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:24,599
Apparently, you've been a bad girl.

1245
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:30,844
Now hold up.
Wait a second. Hey, Alex...

1246
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:33,398
...this James Bond is with Rachel.
- Not now.

1247
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:36,322
I got a hunch. This guy is bad.
I can feel it right now.

1248
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:38,525
I said, not now.
Let me figure this out!

1249
01:16:38,689 --> 01:16:40,441
How did big shot know
she was bad?

1250
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:43,601
I got 45 seconds to figure out
this logarithmic code...

1251
01:16:43,769 --> 01:16:46,044
...or we'll all die
because we'll blow up.

1252
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:49,679
Why don't you stick to your perfume
ads and leave the espionage to me?

1253
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:51,123
No, don't say that to him.

1254
01:16:51,289 --> 01:16:53,883
Hey, Zorro, it's not perfume.
It's cologne.

1255
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:56,047
No, Kelly! No!

1256
01:17:07,609 --> 01:17:09,600
Come on, come on.
Here we go.

1257
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:11,646
- Code invalid.
- Come on.

1258
01:17:11,809 --> 01:17:13,242
Eighteen, seventeen...

1259
01:17:13,889 --> 01:17:14,958
...sixteen...

1260
01:17:18,169 --> 01:17:19,682
Thirteen...

1261
01:17:19,849 --> 01:17:21,043
...twelve...

1262
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:22,198
...eleven...

1263
01:17:25,569 --> 01:17:30,006
Nine, eight, seven.
Sequence aborted.

1264
01:17:30,169 --> 01:17:31,284
I got it. I got it.

1265
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:33,565
No, I don't. No, I don't.
No, I don't.

1266
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:41,847
Don't do it! Put that shit down.
Put the gun down right now.

1267
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,837
Putting it down. Okay?

1268
01:17:45,889 --> 01:17:47,959
But I'm on your side.
I'm with BNS.

1269
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:50,689
What do BNS stand for?
Bitch that Need Slapping?

1270
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:53,761
I tried to make sure Carlos
doesn't get to this computer.

1271
01:17:53,929 --> 01:17:56,124
Think I believe that?
What's wrong with you?

1272
01:17:56,289 --> 01:17:59,759
- Hear her trying to flip the script?
- She's saying she's good?

1273
01:17:59,929 --> 01:18:02,363
I gotta hear this.
This should be rich.

1274
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:05,089
We've suspected Carlos
was dirty for months.

1275
01:18:05,249 --> 01:18:07,809
Mac and me teamed up with him
so we could nail him.

1276
01:18:07,969 --> 01:18:10,529
- Why didn't they tell me?
- You know how this works.

1277
01:18:10,969 --> 01:18:13,403
It's all on a need-to-know basis.
You know that.

1278
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:16,367
Mac didn't want you protecting me
at the wrong time.

1279
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:19,327
That's all Carlos would have
needed. He's jealous of us.

1280
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:21,286
- He is?
- lf he knew how we felt...

1281
01:18:21,449 --> 01:18:23,679
Go easy now.
Don't be creeping up and shit.

1282
01:18:23,849 --> 01:18:26,409
She got long legs.
Bitch is sneaky. She'll kick you.

1283
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,560
He's always known
I wanted to work with you.

1284
01:18:28,729 --> 01:18:30,720
- You wanted to work with me?
- Yeah.

1285
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:32,561
What, like on a stakeout?

1286
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,318
Don't you know
how I feel about you?

1287
01:18:36,489 --> 01:18:39,686
- That's bullshit.
- My head's spinning. I don't know...

1288
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:43,205
- Can't deny it. I feel the same...
- You dizzy from massive blood loss...

1289
01:18:43,369 --> 01:18:46,008
...because the bitch stabbed you
15 minutes ago!

1290
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:49,047
I could have crippled him
for life if I wanted to.

1291
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:52,963
- You've got full mobility in your leg?
- It doesn't feel that bad.

1292
01:18:53,129 --> 01:18:54,357
Son of a gun.

1293
01:18:55,769 --> 01:18:59,523
I had no idea.
Carlos was jealous of us?

1294
01:18:59,689 --> 01:19:01,566
Enough.
I can't listen to this shit.

1295
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:04,482
What's wrong with you?
You booty-blinded right now.

1296
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:07,959
It's like being snow-blinded with
no snow, just a cute piece of ass.

1297
01:19:08,129 --> 01:19:10,518
No. She's telling the truth.

1298
01:19:10,689 --> 01:19:13,249
You don't understand the spy world.
There are agents.

1299
01:19:13,409 --> 01:19:16,367
There are double agents, and
there are pseudo-double agents.

1300
01:19:16,529 --> 01:19:18,326
It's actually pretty standard stuff.

1301
01:19:18,489 --> 01:19:20,286
Y'all stabbing each other is standard?

1302
01:19:20,609 --> 01:19:23,601
Yeah. It's pretty standard.

1303
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:24,958
Look out!

1304
01:19:36,409 --> 01:19:37,558
I'm watching your ass.

1305
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:41,365
Alex, you idiot!
I'm on your side!

1306
01:19:41,529 --> 01:19:42,848
I've had enough of this!

1307
01:19:52,649 --> 01:19:54,844
There's Vitalis and shit all over...

1308
01:19:55,009 --> 01:19:59,321
He was coming like a buzz saw. If you
didn't grab him, he was gonna kill me.

1309
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:02,128
It was like looking
in the eyes of the devil.

1310
01:20:02,649 --> 01:20:04,162
Where's Rachel?

1311
01:20:05,249 --> 01:20:07,638
Yeah, where is Rachel, huh?
She gone.

1312
01:20:07,809 --> 01:20:09,959
Didn't I tell you
that bitch was bad?

1313
01:20:10,129 --> 01:20:11,801
Why didn't you keep
an eye on her?

1314
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:14,847
- You said she was good!
- You can't listen to what I say.

1315
01:20:15,009 --> 01:20:17,648
I'm bleeding from a knife wound.
I'm delusional!

1316
01:20:17,809 --> 01:20:20,562
You said yourself I'm booty-blind.
I'm blinded by ass.

1317
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:22,367
You blinded now, but a minute ago...

1318
01:20:22,529 --> 01:20:25,999
You two fools just let Rachel
escape with Gundars' computer?

1319
01:20:26,169 --> 01:20:29,206
That has all the passwords
to his numbered accounts.

1320
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:32,805
It's worth billions of dollars!
Mac knew you would screw this up.

1321
01:20:32,969 --> 01:20:34,322
That's why he sent me...

1322
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:38,842
"Worth billions of dollars."
You hear this guy?

1323
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:41,484
He's still a bad guy, right?

1324
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:44,364
Yeah, he...
Well, I don't know.

1325
01:20:44,529 --> 01:20:47,566
Everybody keeps flip-flopping
around. I can't keep it straight.

1326
01:20:47,729 --> 01:20:49,082
It's murky.

1327
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:51,809
- You said it was standard...
- I know what I said!

1328
01:20:51,969 --> 01:20:54,324
It's murky when there ain't
no girl involved, huh?

1329
01:20:54,489 --> 01:20:55,808
I see how it go.

1330
01:20:55,969 --> 01:20:58,688
I'll tell you one thing. Good
or bad, I'm tying this guy up.

1331
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,564
We tie everybody up.
That's the new rule.

1332
01:21:01,889 --> 01:21:04,961
Why don't you stop stressing?
There's the Leafy Bug, baby.

1333
01:21:05,169 --> 01:21:07,285
That's what we set out to do,
and we got it!

1334
01:21:07,449 --> 01:21:09,087
We got the plane.
We heroes.

1335
01:21:09,249 --> 01:21:11,399
- You're right. Let's go home.
- Look at that.

1336
01:21:11,569 --> 01:21:14,447
- You wanna see something cool?
- What?

1337
01:21:19,569 --> 01:21:21,958
Man, that is some superfly,
superspy shit!

1338
01:21:22,129 --> 01:21:23,528
Let me see.
What you pressing?

1339
01:21:23,689 --> 01:21:25,759
- Just press that button.
- Okay.

1340
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:27,483
- Invisible.
- Invisible.

1341
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:30,641
Gotta get that on my cars. You know
how clean my garage is gonna look?

1342
01:21:30,809 --> 01:21:33,369
Visible. Invisible.
Visible...

1343
01:21:33,529 --> 01:21:35,997
- Don't wear out the battery.
- Let me have some fun.

1344
01:21:36,169 --> 01:21:39,957
- It loses its specialness. Give it back.
- Come on, why you acting...?

1345
01:21:40,769 --> 01:21:43,647
Why you gotta be tripping?
Why can't I play with it?

1346
01:21:43,809 --> 01:21:46,369
- You broke it.
- I broke the shit? How I break it?

1347
01:21:46,529 --> 01:21:49,202
Like a child, you knock it
out of my hand. I broke it?

1348
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:51,087
You happy now?
How will I explain this?

1349
01:21:51,249 --> 01:21:54,047
I show up with the plane
and a broken remote.

1350
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:55,801
You think they're worried
about the remote?

1351
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:58,847
There's dead bodies all over the roof.
You think they'll care about that?

1352
01:21:59,009 --> 01:22:00,920
- Come on, man!
- You're right. Let's go.

1353
01:22:01,089 --> 01:22:03,319
- We're heroes.
- I'm gonna get my parade, huh?

1354
01:22:03,489 --> 01:22:06,481
- Maybe so.
- I'll definitely get a parade behind this.

1355
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:11,725
All right. Settle back,
and I'm gonna fire this baby up.

1356
01:22:12,889 --> 01:22:15,528
And that is why they call it
the Switchblade.

1357
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,924
All right. Ready
for the ride of your life?

1358
01:22:25,089 --> 01:22:26,522
Yeah, let's do this.

1359
01:22:29,649 --> 01:22:30,684
Watch this.

1360
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:33,048
Punch it!

1361
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:40,123
Got a little wrinkle.
Not to worry.

1362
01:22:47,969 --> 01:22:50,483
Kelly Robinson ain't supposed
to go out like this!

1363
01:22:50,649 --> 01:22:53,117
I'm supposed to die in the ring!

1364
01:22:57,529 --> 01:23:00,282
Kelly, you okay?
Come here. You okay?

1365
01:23:00,449 --> 01:23:02,360
Hell, no! I ain't okay.

1366
01:23:02,529 --> 01:23:04,918
You just crashed my parade
down into the river.

1367
01:23:05,089 --> 01:23:08,445
We had nozzle failure. Then the
thrust manifold went all haywire.

1368
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:11,442
You didn't check it, did you?
Huh? This is perfect!

1369
01:23:11,609 --> 01:23:15,238
My first mission, I do everything right.
Now thanks to you, I ain't a hero!

1370
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:17,764
- What is that?
- This is my flotation device.

1371
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:19,123
- That's a bomb!
- What?

1372
01:23:19,289 --> 01:23:20,768
That's a thermonuclear bomb.

1373
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:23,159
Why you gotta throw them
around here, then?

1374
01:23:23,329 --> 01:23:27,038
No, it's okay. It's not armed.
Can you imagine if this had gone off?

1375
01:23:27,209 --> 01:23:29,165
This would have killed millions!

1376
01:23:29,329 --> 01:23:32,446
- And they didn't arm it?
- They didn't get a chance to.

1377
01:23:32,609 --> 01:23:34,804
You know why
they didn't get a chance to?

1378
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:36,288
Because we stopped them!

1379
01:23:36,449 --> 01:23:38,246
We stopped them.
Know what that means?

1380
01:23:38,409 --> 01:23:40,718
- I think so.
- We heroes again!

1381
01:23:40,889 --> 01:23:43,278
- Damn, you're right.
- Bet your pink ass I'm right!

1382
01:23:43,449 --> 01:23:45,724
We're heroes again!
Even without the plane.

1383
01:23:45,889 --> 01:23:48,119
- We're heroes!
- This is the proof right here!

1384
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:50,757
- This bomb.
- I can't wait to call the president.

1385
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:53,921
We gonna get the Congressional
Medal of Honour and a parade!

1386
01:23:54,089 --> 01:23:55,238
This will be fantastic.

1387
01:24:05,209 --> 01:24:06,961
Has my bank transfer come through?

1388
01:24:07,129 --> 01:24:08,960
Not yet, Ms. Tessio.

1389
01:24:35,009 --> 01:24:37,364
Where you going?
You forgot your drink.

1390
01:24:37,529 --> 01:24:39,167
Alex, how are you?

1391
01:24:39,489 --> 01:24:41,525
- God!
- Came prepared this time.

1392
01:24:41,689 --> 01:24:42,678
Smart.

1393
01:24:42,849 --> 01:24:44,123
Where you going?
Back up.

1394
01:24:44,289 --> 01:24:45,927
You thought
you was gonna get away?

1395
01:24:46,089 --> 01:24:48,239
Thought you was gonna
make a fool out of Kelly Robinson?

1396
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:51,560
When I have my parade, I'll tie
your ass to the front of a float.

1397
01:24:51,929 --> 01:24:53,760
Alex?

1398
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,799
How about a stakeout
in Greece for two weeks?

1399
01:24:57,969 --> 01:24:59,527
- Stakeout?
- Yeah.

1400
01:25:00,289 --> 01:25:01,688
Two weeks?

1401
01:25:03,889 --> 01:25:05,561
Hey! The answer is still no.

1402
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:08,926
I know. I was just imagining
for a second. There's no harm in...

1403
01:25:09,089 --> 01:25:12,320
You taking a long time. Tell her no.
You getting lost in this. No!

1404
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:13,888
- No.
- In fact, say, "Hell, no!"

1405
01:25:14,049 --> 01:25:16,768
- Hell, no.
- Hell, no, bitch!

1406
01:25:17,089 --> 01:25:19,557
Sorry.
The spell wore off.

1407
01:25:21,369 --> 01:25:24,600
Well, boys, I'm glad you guys
got all the news coverage.

1408
01:25:24,769 --> 01:25:27,363
- What's that mean?
- Always got to have the last word.

1409
01:25:27,529 --> 01:25:29,565
She always gotta say some shit, huh?

1410
01:25:29,849 --> 01:25:33,000
What she talking about, news
coverage? Ain't been no news...

1411
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:34,363
Is that Carlos?

1412
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,239
- "Superspy hero thwarts..."
- Carlos was good.

1413
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:41,082
- We the ones that saved the day!
- Is this a parade?

1414
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,763
Yes! Look at the spectacle
and the glitter and shit!

1415
01:25:43,929 --> 01:25:45,567
That's my parade!
He stole my parade!

1416
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:47,640
- I don't know what to say.
- I know what to say. Bullshit!

1417
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,367
Bullshit!

1418
01:25:51,769 --> 01:25:52,918
Bullshit!

1419
01:25:53,089 --> 01:25:55,239
We gotta go to Washington
and get debriefed.

1420
01:25:55,409 --> 01:25:57,240
- I ain't going!
- I don't blame you.

1421
01:25:57,409 --> 01:26:01,084
It's just, I was looking forward
to testing out the hover gel with you.

1422
01:26:03,369 --> 01:26:05,087
- The whatsit gel?
- Hover.

1423
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:07,763
It's a gelatinous hydrogen diphyoxide.

1424
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:10,841
It's 12 times lighter than air.
You smear it all over your body...

1425
01:26:11,009 --> 01:26:12,761
...and if you're in an
oxygen-rich environment...

1426
01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:15,602
...it allows you to float
down to earth like a bird.

1427
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:19,407
Like a jelly bird?

1428
01:26:19,569 --> 01:26:23,278
Yeah. That's the street name for it.
"Jelly Bird." Exactly.

1429
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:25,565
They have a couple
on the transport plane.

1430
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:29,358
Plan was, they drop us off over D.C.,
and we float down like birds.

1431
01:26:29,529 --> 01:26:33,283
There's press and photographers.
It's gonna be a whole spectacle, but...

1432
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:35,167
What we waiting on?
Let's do this.

1433
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:37,240
- You'll do it?
- Hell, yeah, I'll do it!

1434
01:26:37,409 --> 01:26:39,718
Float like a jelly bird?
Let's go right now.

1435
01:26:39,889 --> 01:26:42,039
I used to always dream
I'd be able to fly.

1436
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:44,279
- You serious?
- My grandma said I was a fool.

1437
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,007
That's what made her
punch me the first time!

1438
01:26:46,169 --> 01:26:48,080
- See, I told her and...
- Hold on.

1439
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:50,843
Get some jelly on the plane
and two parachutes.

1440
01:26:51,305 --> 01:26:57,482
