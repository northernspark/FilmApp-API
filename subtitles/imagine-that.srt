00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,414
Mr. Danielson?

3
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,000
He took my blanket!

4
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,376
Okay. Everybody calm down!
Calm down, everybody.

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,836
You'll get your blanket!

6
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,011
lt's mine! Legally, it's mine! lt's mine!

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,890
Nice, Evan. Really nice.

8
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,351
Evan, get help. Get help!

9
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,353
l don't need help!
What l need is my blanket!

10
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,939
- Man, you're crazy!
- l am not crazy! l want my goo-gaa!

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,901
l want my goo-gaa!

12
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,819
He wasn't always this way.

13
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,907
Once upon a time, he was a king.

14
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,329
The king of Somewhere.

15
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,039
Strong and powerful.

16
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,248
What l'm suggesting is that

17
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,709
you reallocate 8% of your equity
into international markets.

18
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,381
He protected his loyal subjects
and made them feel safe.

19
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,049
All right, are you looking at the charts?

20
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,719
Well, these are actually very
conservative projections. Yes they are.

21
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,138
But one day he left his Kingdom

22
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,809
and he got lost in the Land of Nowhere.

23
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,520
Something no one could
have ever imagined.

24
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,039
Everybody's upped their stocks...

25
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:07,293
I am here to taIk about finances,
Wall Street...

26
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,856
In Nowhere Land,
everybody wanted to be king,

27
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,942
or at Ieast they aII try to be.

28
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,028
Evan, it's Noah. I got a feather.

29
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,529
- You got a what?
- A feather.

30
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,156
lt was on my desk with a note attached.

31
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,574
- From Johnny Whitefeather?
- Yup.

32
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,658
What'd the note say?

33
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,203
"l'll be at your 9:00 a.m. See you
in there. Ain't nothing but a thing."

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,623
- Wow. Then the rumor must be true.
- What? What rumor?

35
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,167
- Stevens is cashing in.
- What?

36
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,336
- He's selling the company?
- He has to be.

37
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,629
His repIacement is gonna be me
or Johnny!

38
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,797
You're gonna get this job!

39
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,135
- Hey. Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

40
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,179
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Mr. Danielson.

41
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,805
It was a very strange pIace.

42
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,682
...and they've narrowed it down
to our firm and two others.

43
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,393
And it is confirmed, Whitefeather is
gonna be in the meeting.

44
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:09,189
The King was reaIIy unhappy there.
He just couIdn't figure out why.

45
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,982
- Hey, Tod!
- What's up, Mr. D?

46
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,984
Take this down to graphics
and add it to my chart, all right?

47
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,694
- After l...
- Now.

48
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,656
- What about the...
- Hey, "now" now, man. What's up?

49
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,033
- How much are we paying that guy?
- He's an unpaid intern.

50
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,077
lt might be too much.

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,414
l think it was because he was
aIways working to protect his castIe

52
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,417
from those who wanted
to steal his crown.

53
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,419
Johnny Whitefeather.

54
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,131
Evan Danielson.
Fellow salmon swimming upstream.

55
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,093
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:44,224
So those of us he left behind
went out into the land to rescue him.

57
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,855
Whip, l said l'd sit you down with
our two best financial managers.

58
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,235
Evan's been our number-one guy
for the last eight and a half years.

59
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,028
Johnny's been with us for 16 months,

60
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,031
but he's already
one of our top producers.

61
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,660
Either way, you'll be well taken care of
here at Smith/Stevens.

62
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,329
- Evan?
- Mr. Bryson.

63
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,747
You've made some
really sound investments,

64
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,875
but quite frankly, l think we can do
better. Let's see if you agree.

65
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,088
Evan Danielson's office.

66
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:20,176
Now, this will give you a solid base of
capital and a 9 to 11 % yield, annually.

67
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,471
Yeah, l understand. ls it...
His daughter?

68
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,515
Did you call her mother?

69
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,769
Because if l say it's urgent
and he's really, really...

70
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,273
The goo-gaa?

71
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,192
- Fantastic, Evan.
- Thank you, Tom.

72
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,154
- Johnny?
- Thank you, Tom. Whip.

73
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,408
Dave, Lee, Troy.
l see those looks of skepticism,

74
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,411
just like old man Stevens
the first week that he hired me.

75
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,956
Said to himself, "l hired an lndian.
Can he handle money?"

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,541
And how.

77
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,799
Hey, l really appreciate
you letting me contribute

78
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,427
a little piece of venison to your potlatch.

79
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,137
Okay.

80
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,890
We're here under one sky.

81
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,227
All of us, under one sky.
Let's appreciate that.

82
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,605
One sky.

83
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,818
Evan Danielson,
that man over there is a seer.

84
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,695
Uses the whole eye.

85
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,616
But there is a difference between sight

86
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,244
and vision.

87
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,084
Sight is about
what lies just in front of us.

88
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,797
Vision is about what lies ahead.

89
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,549
- The genius of the hawk...
- Excuse me.

90
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,093
Johnny, sorry to interrupt you

91
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,470
in one of your always interesting stories
about nature,

92
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,056
but, gentlemen, l have...
l'm gonna have to leave you, Mr. Bryson,

93
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,351
in the very capable hands of
my colleague Mr. Noah Kulick here.

94
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,396
l have a little family emergency at my
daughter's school l have to take care of.

95
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,814
Thank you for your time, sir.

96
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,649
That's what we're all talking about.

97
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,820
Life, nest, eggs. Circle of life.

98
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,406
Yeah. Hakuna matata.

99
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,117
l'm so sorry, but the school kept calling.

100
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,868
- Don't tell me. The goo-gaa.
- Yeah.

101
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,286
l hate that blanket!

102
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,041
We don't normally allow
any kind of security items at school,

103
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,377
but because of yours
and Trish's separation,

104
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,087
we made a temporary exception.

105
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,632
Unfortunately,
it's just not workable anymore.

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,968
Hey, you guys.

107
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,219
So this is why l was called out of work?

108
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,138
Because my daughter's
sitting by herself at recess?

109
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,515
No, the reason l called you,
Mr. Danielson,

110
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,184
is because her class went inside
45 minutes ago.

111
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:37,230
She's still sitting here because
Kupida and Mopida told her to.

112
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,900
- Kupida and Mopida are...
- Yeah. l know. Her imaginary friends.

113
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,195
l told Trish we're gonna have to
do something about that blanket.

114
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,363
Well, Trish and l discussed this,

115
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,198
and we both feel that
what needs to be dealt with

116
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,910
is the reason why she still feels
she needs a blanket.

117
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,788
lt's usually an indication of
some kind of emotional needs

118
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,457
that haven't been met.

119
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,668
What's happening? Are they talking?

120
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,004
Well, you know, sometimes,
these things are like a Band-Aid.

121
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,589
You just have to rip it off.

122
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,091
Right.

123
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,427
Rip it.

124
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,512
Rip.

125
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,271
Kupida. l can't hear you both
at the same time.

126
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,190
Go ahead, Mopida.

127
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,860
Wait. Wait a minute.
Someone's coming.

128
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,115
Hey, Liv.

129
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,785
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, baby.

130
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,871
Hey, remember we talked about
how the day was gonna come

131
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,499
when you couldn't take the goo-gaa
to school with you anymore?

132
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,125
That day is gonna be today.

133
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,378
So what Daddy's gonna do
is l'm gonna take the goo-gaa.

134
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,545
l'm gonna hold on to it for you.

135
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,299
When you get home from school,
you'll get it back then, all right?

136
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,635
All right, sweetie.
Just give me the goo-gaa.

137
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,388
And you have a great day.
All right, baby.

138
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,410
As you know,
the Mile High City Arts Council

139
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,912
relies solely on contributions.

140
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,959
Yeah. l've got 12 people and four desks.
We need your money.

141
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,548
Mr. Cosgrove, can l call you right back?

142
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,634
Trish, please, this is a really bad week.

143
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,221
Evan, l told you three months ago
that this week was pledge week.

144
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,973
- That's this week?
- Yes.

145
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,268
You promised me you wouldn't do this.
You promised me.

146
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,020
Look, Evan,
l know you and her haven't ever...

147
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,439
- Trish, please, not this week.
- ...had a chance...

148
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,940
- Not this week. l'm begging you.
- ...to connect.

149
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,734
- Can we flip-flop and l'll do it next week?
- No!

150
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,985
- l promise you...
- No.

151
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,571
Evan, even if l could, l wouldn't.

152
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,247
Evan, why did you tell me
you even wanted to have children?

153
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,208
'Cause l did. l do!

154
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,963
l just didn't know l'd be so bad at it.

155
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,967
You know, Evan,
you're a really smart guy.

156
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,470
You make huge deals every day.

157
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:17,766
l'm sure you'll find a way
to deal with her.

158
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,731
Sweetie, you're gonna go
with Daddy, okay?

159
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,192
- Okay.
- He's so excited.

160
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,654
And l'm gonna call you every night
to say good night.

161
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,740
- Promise?
- You'll be fine. You'll be fine.

162
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,949
- Okay.
- l love you, kiddo.

163
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,368
l love you, too.

164
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,884
Okay, here we go.

165
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,930
Hey, you're a competitive guy.

166
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,766
That's intimidating,
especially in a father figure.

167
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,352
Okay, first of all,
l'm not her father figure.

168
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,313
l'm her father.
And she's the one that's intimidating.

169
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,774
- What?
- Honestly. She just stares at me!

170
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,942
Or through me.

171
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,778
She's got this imaginary world
that she goes to

172
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,907
with Kupida and Kapuda and Zupida.
l don't get it.

173
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,576
Look, l'm gonna put this
as gently as possible, okay?

174
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,911
You're a complete idiot.

175
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,789
You feel out of control
and you project that onto her.

176
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,418
Hey, look, man.
Be my friend and be my client.

177
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,170
But don't be Mr. Mystic Man
or whatever that is you call yourself.

178
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,714
- Man Whisperer.
- The Man Whisperer.

179
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,675
John Strother, former cornerback
for the Denver Broncos,

180
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,885
is now known as the "Man Whisperer."

181
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,304
- That's right.
- You be whispering to men.

182
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,975
Look, all l'm saying is that
we all have a little kid inside, right here.

183
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,643
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And he's whispering.

184
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,437
Stop. Please. Stop. Stop!

185
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,521
lf you don't whisper to little Evan,

186
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,940
- you'll never get through to Olivia!
- l'm not whispering to little Evan

187
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,150
- and l'm not whispering with you.
- You just did.

188
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,693
No, l wasn't.
No, l wasn't whispering with you.

189
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,819
l was whispering on the other...

190
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,696
You was finished talking,
and then l said "whisper" after.

191
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,822
l wasn't whispering with you.

192
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,115
Little Evan?
What's wrong with little Evan?

193
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,076
Say it again. Say, "Whisper to little
Evan," one more time. Say it again.

194
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,786
- You know what's gonna happen?
- What's gonna happen? What?

195
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,497
- What you gonna do?
- l'm gonna crash your portfolio.

196
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,499
What's that have to do with anything?

197
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,759
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

198
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,636
- You wear him out?
- No, but Olivia will.

199
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,973
- Where are they at?
- Upstairs. Princess dress-up.

200
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,017
What? They started without me?

201
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,355
- Hey, Ev. Livvy's upstairs.
- Thanks. Thanks for watching her.

202
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,273
Absolutely. Anytime.

203
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,152
And Trish told me to remind you,
vaccinations on Thursday.

204
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,946
- Okay.
- And Ella's party is Friday.

205
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,033
lt's a sleepover here,
so pack all of her stuff.

206
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,035
And the Fall Sing is Saturday.

207
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,038
Livvy's really nervous,
so go through her songs with her.

208
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,165
She doesn't think l'm gonna
remember all this, does she?

209
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,958
No. She does not.

210
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,883
Oh, no. Come on, guys.

211
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,969
More! l want to be beautiful!

212
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,388
Hey, Ev.

213
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,056
l've got the perfect size seat
for little Evan.

214
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,225
- Come, sit down.
- l think l'm fine. l'm okay.

215
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,394
Come on, Liv, let's go. We gotta go.

216
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,814
- Bye, Olivia.
- Bye, Ella.

217
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,273
- Bye, Liv.
- Bye.

218
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,067
Denver Broncos, huh?

219
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,992
No, Mopida, l can't go.

220
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,911
No.

221
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,830
Well, yeah.

222
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,005
Are you sure, Mopida?

223
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,719
Okay, if you say so.

224
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,643
What? He actually had a snake?
A real snake?

225
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,020
Nobody's going to fall
for this whole shtick.

226
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,190
What we have to do is find a better way
to do this, all right?

227
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,734
No, no, listen.

228
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,528
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna eliminate TriTek.

229
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,155
No, no, no, no.
Look, l'm looking at the specs here,

230
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,574
and l don't like what l see. First of...

231
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,453
Hold on a second.

232
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,788
Olivia, what are you doing?
Go back to bed.

233
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,417
- You said you'd be a king.
- l said l'd do what?

234
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,380
You said last time that next time
you'd do dress up, and you'd be a king.

235
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,382
Well, l don't recall saying that.
l don't remember saying that.

236
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,633
And even if l did say that,

237
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,677
l don't have the right stuff
to do king stuff here.

238
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,305
l don't have any king clothes,
and l don't have a king hat.

239
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,973
lt's called a crown.

240
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,600
- Evan, you there?
- Hold on a second.

241
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,393
Whatever. Olivia, please, just go to bed.

242
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,561
l will sleep in here.

243
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,938
No, you're sleeping in your room.
That's why you have a bedroom.

244
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,317
- You go sleep in your bedroom.
- l do not want to sleep in there.

245
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,738
All right. You're gonna go to sleep?
You promise?

246
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:46,493
Go over there and lay down. Be quiet,
Olivia. l have to work here, all right?

247
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,579
l'm sorry, man. Where was l?
What was l saying?

248
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,956
Listen, this is where
we're gonna snake Whitefeather.

249
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,250
'Cause he's thinking we're gonna go
for the obvious play, Solocom.

250
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,796
But what we're gonna do... Digital Fiber.
Digital Fiber is the play.

251
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,131
- That's the obvious choice.
- Stop saying...

252
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,549
Hold on a second.

253
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,635
- Olivia.
- What?

254
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,598
Yeah, sorry about that, man. Look.
No, no, no.

255
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,101
You gotta be quiet.

256
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,770
lt's his job, not yours.

257
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,816
Can l call you back? Thank you.

258
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,277
All right, that's it.

259
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,239
Now, l asked you to be quiet,
but you don't listen.

260
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,157
- Yes, l do.
- No, you don't.

261
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,034
l asked you not to talk,
but you kept talking.

262
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,328
You don't know how to listen,
so since you don't know how to listen,

263
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,747
you take your blanket
and you go in your room. Go.

264
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,794
Come on now.

265
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,462
Come on, come on, really, please.

266
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,507
Come on, please. l'm saying, "Please."
Go to bed, please.

267
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,936
Now what?

268
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,480
What is it?

269
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,819
Look, l told you,
l will play king with you some other time.

270
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,488
Daddy has a lot of work to do.
All right? So...

271
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,117
What?

272
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,828
l do listen.

273
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,575
l'm sorry.

274
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,995
How many days till l go back home?

275
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,714
I've gone over everything we taIked
about Iast night, and it aII Iooks great.

276
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,966
That's perfect, because
Whitefeather's gonna go with Solocom.

277
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,802
- Of course.
- But we got a better alternative.

278
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:09,969
- Digital Fiber.
- Got a good record.

279
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,388
Exactly.
l'm gonna call you in 20 minutes,

280
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,972
- right after l drop Olivia off to school.
- Very nice.

281
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,432
All right. Okay.

282
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,518
Come on, honey. Let's get going.
Daddy's sort of in a hurry.

283
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,311
l think this milk is spoiled.

284
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,313
No. That's not possible,
because l checked this milk.

285
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:22,649
Come on, let's go! Let's go.

286
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,005
What if we say
we just get a muffin, huh?

287
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,340
Tomorrow, can we make pancakes?

288
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,175
Honey, l don't know
if l have the right stuff for that,

289
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,928
- you know, supply-wise or skill-wise.
- l can help you.

290
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,847
l got a better idea.
How about we leave a note for Graciella,

291
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,390
she can make some pancakes,
put them in the freezer,

292
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,475
we'll thaw them out
and eat them tomorrow, huh? Yeah.

293
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,437
- Not what l was thinking.
- Move! Let's move!

294
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,732
Hey, you didn't pack my Fall Sing music.

295
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,736
Okay, your Fall Sing...
Where is that stuff?

296
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,780
Okay, here it is! Right here.
Right here's your music.

297
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,826
Rick?

298
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,955
- l thought you said you were in a hurry.
- Yeah. l'm coming right now.

299
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,255
Okay, stop, stop, stop. Once is enough.

300
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,678
Hey, does Mommy ever make
a new friend, you know, in like a...

301
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,805
- You mean Rick?
- Yes, Rick.

302
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,559
ls that the guy from Mommy's work with
the spiked hair and the pointed face?

303
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,729
"Hello, l'd like to talk to you for a sec."
That guy?

304
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,815
No, that's Skip. Rick is tall.

305
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,985
Handsome, too.
He looks like Prince Charming.

306
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,113
Good for Rick.

307
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,617
- Morning, Graciella.
- Morning, Mr. Danielson.

308
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,244
- Hi, Graciella.
- Hi, Olivia. Nice to see you.

309
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,080
Hey, Graciella! One thing.

310
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,666
Can you please make some pancakes
and put them in the freezer for us?

311
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,627
Thank you so much. All right.

312
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,754
Hey, what are you, a button maniac?
Stop it.

313
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,005
Press one floor and leave it alone.

314
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,965
Daddy?

315
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,344
Kupida wanted me to tell you something.

316
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,054
Yeah. Go ahead.

317
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,849
She heard what you were saying
on the phone last night,

318
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,603
and she told me to tell you
she doesn't like either of them.

319
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,730
Which guy? Rick or Skip?

320
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,651
The companies,
Solocom and Digital Fiber.

321
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:34,406
Kupida doesn't like them,
neither does Mopida, and Qwali agrees.

322
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:38,576
Daddy, do you know
why they don't like them?

323
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,830
Daddy, l said,
do you know why they don't like them?

324
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,207
- Why?
- Because they're broken.

325
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,877
- Do you know which one they do like?
- No, honey, l have no idea.

326
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,880
The first one,
the one you threw away, TriTek.

327
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,508
- Are you sure you're listening?
- Yes, Daddy sure is listening,

328
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,510
but come on, we got to go. Let's go.

329
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,055
Kupida and Mopida really like it.

330
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,224
- You know why?
- Why is that?

331
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:05,312
- Because it has buried treasure.
- Yeah? Okay.

332
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,398
- You aren't listening.
- No, no, Daddy's listening.

333
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,406
Okay, so, we're here,
and we're going in.

334
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,075
And there's something
you have to go without.

335
00:19:44,768 --> 00:19:48,271
Hey, come on, come on,
Olivia, let's go, let's go.

336
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,525
- Liv! How are you?
- Hi!

337
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,195
- Give me five.
- Put her there. Put her there.

338
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,988
Okay, guys, l got, like,
three meetings back to back.

339
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,574
She's just gonna sit down here
and get settled down here.

340
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,201
Let's get settled in. All right.

341
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,328
- Mike, which one can l get rid of?
- Well...

342
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,537
That one.

343
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,206
No. You don't say that one.
That's sacrilege.

344
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,625
That's Dante D'Enzo.
We never get rid of Dante D'Enzo.

345
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,253
- Kupida says he's boring.
- Well, Kupida is estúpida.

346
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,964
Because he happens to be one of
the greatest investors on the planet.

347
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,758
- No, he's boring.
- No, no.

348
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,385
Why am l standing here
arguing with you about Kupida?

349
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,470
Let me get something for you to watch.

350
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,390
There you go. There's the...
What's that? Barney.

351
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,975
Okay, look, can you watch my kid for
me? You have my back for me, Mike?

352
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,811
Watch that Barney and l'll be...

353
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,148
That's not Barney. That's Blue.

354
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:36,236
And now I'm going to tap your knee
very gentIy...

355
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,654
Did you see that?

356
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,698
...by increasing your family's holdings
in optical fiber.

357
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,535
lf you take a look at these charts here
on page six in your folders...

358
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,087
Granted, Solocom looks solid,

359
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,048
but if you pore over the financials,
it's crystal clear,

360
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,676
the smart play here is Digital Fiber.

361
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,971
- Kupida says no.
- Okay.

362
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,432
- No.
- Let's move on Digital Fiber.

363
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,184
l'm sorry. Don't move on Digital Fiber?

364
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:11,438
Oh, no. Yes, yes. Do go, yes. No.

365
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,441
- No?
- Yes. Yes, go, yes.

366
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,906
- Mother?
- Tom?

367
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,452
Johnny?
Perhaps you have something to add?

368
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:30,123
Not really. lt's good work from Evan.
Digital Fiber. Solocom.

369
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,875
l struggled with it myself last night.

370
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,085
l went to sleep convinced
l was gonna take

371
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,381
the Pressman family towards
that pretty face, Solocom.

372
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:42,677
But in the middle of the night,
the dream sparrow comes to me.

373
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,306
She taps me on the forehead and says,
"Wake up, handsome brave.

374
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:49,476
"There's something happening
in Uzbekistan."

375
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,894
"Uzbeka-what?

376
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,439
"lt's 4:30 in the morning, little friend.
l'm sleeping."

377
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:59,486
But she said there's a kalacampi,
the worm hidden in the apple.

378
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,031
And l let the dream sparrow fly away.

379
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:06,159
- The dream sparrow.
- But l investigated what she said

380
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,913
on the white fire grid
you people call the lnternet.

381
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,208
At 4:15 this morning,
Mountain Standard Time,

382
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,670
the Uzbeki government
followed through on a series of threats

383
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:19,422
to detonate a nuclear weapon. Boom.

384
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:22,509
Digital Fiber, Solocom,

385
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:26,930
all of their underground cabling
that they were relying upon,

386
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,892
lost in that mushroom cloud.
Do l blame Uzbekistan? No.

387
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,062
Defend yourself, mountain republic,
just like you said you would.

388
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,563
You followed through.

389
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,027
But 200 miles south, in Turkmenistan,

390
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,824
a little company called TriTek,
didn't look like much to me yesterday,

391
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:51,329
but today, their 6,000 miles of
already-buried underground cabling,

392
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:56,751
looking a lot more valuable.
TriTek, baby. l say we go into TriTek.

393
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,046
- Let's keep our fingers crossed, huh?
- Okay.

394
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:06,052
Evan, you mind if l sit in on your 11:00?

395
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:09,389
Well, Johnny, that's not up to me.
That's up to the client.

396
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,682
So it's cool?

397
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,727
Because l checked with the client,
and they said it's okay.

398
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,020
That's great. That's great.

399
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,815
Hey, ain't nothing but a thing.

400
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,568
The herd moves on,
but you're going to be fine, little elk.

401
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,571
You're going to be just fine.
One sky, man.

402
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:32,787
One sky.

403
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,583
l didn't realize you guys were so tight.

404
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:37,876
You know what l want you to do
for me, Tod?

405
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,420
Go down to legal
and check something out for me. Okay?

406
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,921
l want to know
what the ramifications are

407
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,549
if l were to stab Johnny Whitefeather.

408
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,265
- Daddy!
- Not now, sweetie.

409
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,100
- But, Daddy!
- Hey, not now.

410
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,353
And listen to me, Liv.
This is where Daddy works.

411
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,188
You cannot come down here
and stand outside my meetings

412
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,856
and flail your arms around.

413
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,152
- Rose!
- Yeah.

414
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:07,947
Can you take Olivia downstairs
and get her a muffin or something?

415
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,657
- Are you hungry, honey?
- No.

416
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,201
l don't think she's hungry.

417
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,828
She's starving. l can see that.

418
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,122
Come on. Here we go.
Let's go get a muffin.

419
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,041
Have some girl talk.

420
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,298
- Hey, Ev.
- Hey, give me a second, Noah.

421
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,968
l'm trying to find my notes for the 11:00.

422
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:32,639
Actually, it pertains to the 11:00.
Quickly, two things.

423
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:37,060
First, Johnny has just asked me
to join his tribe.

424
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,315
l can't believe it.
He actually calls his team a tribe.

425
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,734
Yeah, it's stupid.

426
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:49,989
- And you said yes, didn't you?
- No, no, absolutely not, at first.

427
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,825
But then he put
so much pressure on me.

428
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,994
He needed an answer immediately. So...

429
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,330
lt's all well and good, Noah.
But thanks for your loyalty, all right.

430
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,333
Now if you don't mind, l gotta get ready
in about 10 minutes, so if you'd be so...

431
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:04,421
That's the other thing.
About the 11:00, Johnny moved it up.

432
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,089
He had a conflict at 11:00.

433
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,508
Johnny moved my meeting
with my clients?

434
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,718
Yeah. lt started at 10:30,

435
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:15,723
so l popped in here as a courtesy to you,
because we were so tight for so long.

436
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,560
And thank you so much for hiring me.

437
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,770
- Out!
- Okay, l gotta go.

438
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,606
Rose!

439
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,986
Where are my notes for the 11:00?

440
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,822
- Sorry. l think they're in there.
- They're not in there.

441
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:41,916
Mr. D, l talked to the lawyer guy upstairs
and he confirmed my hunch

442
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:46,296
about the whole stabbing
Mr. Whitefeather thing.

443
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:50,800
lt's a definite no-can-do
from a legal standpoint.

444
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:55,513
- Go away, Tod. Go very far away.
- Yes. Right.

445
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,353
l can't find them.

446
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,687
Well, they're here somewhere, Rose.

447
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,272
Please, l can't make it happen
without my notes.

448
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,066
- Find my notes. Please.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

449
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,985
All of a sudden, l'm late for a meeting
that l was early for in the first place.

450
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,446
All right. lt's all right.
We're gonna find them.

451
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:19,662
Oh, my God.

452
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,915
Did you draw on my worksheets?

453
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,085
- Qwali said l could.
- Qwali said you could?

454
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,087
Qwali said you could.
But let me tell you something, Olivia.

455
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,880
l'm getting ready to go into
a meeting with grown people.

456
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,173
They're gonna be judging Daddy,

457
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,008
and all of a sudden,
my worksheets have

458
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,011
pictures of flowers and sparkly stuff

459
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:37,597
and, what is this,
people kissing or something?

460
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,349
Kupida says they might get married.

461
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:42,560
And why is this sticky?
Why is this so sticky?

462
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:45,021
lt's sparkle glue. Sparkly.

463
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,606
This is a disaster.

464
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:06,543
- A horror show.
- Live.

465
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,713
Love. Laugh. Walahala!

466
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:15,635
Live. Love. Laugh. Walahala!

467
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,141
l have never, guys,
l have never felt so jazzed

468
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:25,979
about the prospects of our pension fund!
l mean it. l am jazzed!

469
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,939
l wish l could take credit, Fred,

470
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:31,317
but we gotta give that to the Walahala,
Mr. Waterfall.

471
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,737
Hey, rain down prosperity!

472
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:37,574
- And how.
- Thank you, Johnny!

473
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:47,208
Evan. Everybody,
you remember Evan Danielson.

474
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,503
l would hope so, after seven years
of working with you guys.

475
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:53,882
Yeah. Of course.
How's it going there, Evan?

476
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,718
Good to see you.
Hey, look, while we were waiting for you,

477
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:01,806
Mr. Whitefeather, he made some rather
radical suggestions, as you can see.

478
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:03,516
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

479
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,479
So what do you think, Evan?
You agree with Mr. Whitefeather here,

480
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:12,692
or do you have some special insight
that you'd like to share with us about

481
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,861
how you would increase the fund?

482
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,532
l think l do have some insight.
l don't agree with Mr. Whitefeather.

483
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:26,581
What l was going to suggest was

484
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:30,877
a 4% reallocation
away from convertible arbitrage.

485
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,799
And in addition

486
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,389
to that...

487
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:44,682
Okay. Good. Thank you.

488
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:49,062
l don't know about you guys,
but this is good for me.

489
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,480
Didn't l tell you he was good?

490
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,940
Hey, man.

491
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,818
Sometimes the best spear
is the one you don't throw.

492
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,403
Ain't nothing but a thing.

493
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,910
"Ain't nothing but a thing."
What does that even mean, Johnny?

494
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:07,080
lt's not a thing, but it is?
lt's something, but it's not a thing?

495
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:11,751
But it's not. But it's something.
What is... l'm confused! What's that?

496
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:15,088
You're a seeker, brother crow.
You should ride that...

497
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,756
You know what? Stop it right now.
Stop it!

498
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,966
Because l'm not going to be
subjected to your

499
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:20,385
Dr. Seuss-meets-Pocahontas
stuff today.

500
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:23,763
"One sky, two sky, red sky, blue sky!"

501
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:27,475
Evan, that's shadow time. Okay.
Let's keep that in the shadows.

502
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,603
Oh, no. Please, please, please,
make him stop. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

503
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,482
Lord, Lord, Lord, make him stop, Lord.
Why are you falling for this?

504
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,609
What's the matter? l've been
working for you for seven years.

505
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:39,738
And you know that, Fred!
l went to your grandson's birthday party,

506
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,031
and l went to Aspen with you
and your wife for the whole weekend.

507
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,199
We got history together.

508
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,702
You gonna throw it all away because
this guy showed you some waterfalls

509
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,120
and got you chanting "Walla Walla"?

510
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:50,790
Evan, we're always looking for fresh
ideas, and he showed us some.

511
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,167
lt's like Johnny says.

512
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,297
You got turtles that live in their shell
and turtles that live out of their shell.

513
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,007
What? What? What did you just say?

514
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,134
What did he say? Johnny just said...
What did he tell you?

515
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,969
What was that?
What did he say? What?

516
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,263
He said turtles with no shell...

517
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:06,806
Called geckos, man.

518
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,101
That's not even biology!

519
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:13,688
How could you listen...
What's a frog, Johnny? A short snake?

520
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:16,066
You want new ideas?
Special new ideas. Okay.

521
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,735
'Cause slow, predictable growth
is so boring.

522
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,071
Let's talk about... Let's talk about
a little company called ChemStar.

523
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,406
Let's talk about this company.
l say go out and buy lots of it.

524
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,243
Buy lots and lots of ChemStar.
You know why? Because it's sparkly.

525
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,996
Everybody knows that
everybody loves sparkly things,

526
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,166
so go out and buy some ChemStar
because it's sparkly!

527
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,918
Okay. Here's fresh new idea
number two.

528
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,545
These companies were so stinky
l had to snip them all away.

529
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,673
Snip! Snip! Snip!
lf you're not good, you got to go!

530
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,134
Okay.
Here's fresh new idea number three!

531
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,261
Look at that.
You got YellowFin and AeroDyne.

532
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,223
What are they doing?
YellowFin and AeroDyne.

533
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:51,601
They're kissing.
And what does kissing usually lead to?

534
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,690
Marriage! They're getting married!

535
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:02,112
YeIIowFin and AeroDyne sitting in a tree
K- l-S-S-l-N-G

536
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:04,531
First comes Iove, come on
Then comes marriage...

537
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,783
- Evan. Stop.
- No, don't stop me.

538
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:11,621
l got more. l got more, Tom!
Fresh new idea number four. NeoDyne.

539
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,081
NeoDyne,
that's your biggest holding, right?

540
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:14,749
6% of your equity is in NeoDyne.

541
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,043
You know what fresh new thinking has
to say about that company?

542
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:18,712
Pull out! Pull out now. You know why?

543
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,713
Because NeoDyne is about
to have his pants pulled down

544
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:22,590
and have his underwear exposed.
Know what's in the underwear?

545
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,175
- No.
- Poop.

546
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,469
Poop is in the underwear.

547
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,848
Poop. Nasty doo-doo. Stinky ca-ca.
So here's a recap.

548
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,475
NeoDyne, pants pulled down,
butt exposed,

549
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,853
poo-poo, doo-doo, stinky ca-ca. Okay?

550
00:31:34,936 --> 00:31:37,564
Those are my fresh new...
You take this. You hold on to it.

551
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,607
So those are my new ideas.
Thank you so much!

552
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:43,486
Raining down!
Fresh ideas and Walla Walla!

553
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:55,915
- Did you tell them what Kupida said?
- Yeah. l sure did.

554
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,418
Did they like it?

555
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,962
l imagine it was
a lot of fun to watch, honey.

556
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,845
Oh, God. What have l done?
What have l done?

557
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,930
ls everything okay?

558
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:21,816
Hey, Ev?

559
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,528
Stevens wants to see you. Yeah.

560
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,180
- He just kind of flipped out.
- He lost it, man. He lost it.

561
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:55,350
Look, whatever you heard l said,
it's probably a lot worse.

562
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:59,229
- l heard you said poop.
- Yeah, l said poop. Twice.

563
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:00,688
Nice.

564
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:05,985
l will be back in as much time

565
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,780
as it officially takes to say,
"You're fired," all right?

566
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,344
Evan, what...

567
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,096
Tom, l don't know what...

568
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,683
l'm still trying to process
what just happened in there.

569
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,019
So am l, too. Really, Tom.

570
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,688
How did you know
about all those things?

571
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:46,276
Listen to me, Tom. There's... What?

572
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,486
The two companies
you said were kissing.

573
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,863
AeroDyne and YellowFin.

574
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:52,699
- What did you mean by that?
- l just...

575
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:55,452
My brother-in-law
sits on the board ofAeroDyne.

576
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:59,539
For 18 months, they've been looking for
a partner to offset their overseas debt.

577
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:02,041
Of the literally
700 companies considered,

578
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:05,587
there's only one whose financials
actually made sense,

579
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,172
and that's YellowFin.

580
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:11,134
Now, how did you know
about this impending marriage?

581
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:16,181
- l just...
- Kupida said they might get married.

582
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:20,185
ChemStar.
You said to buy because it was sparkly.

583
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:21,978
Yes?

584
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:25,482
- Yeah, okay...
- A data-wire

585
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:30,737
came in during the meeting.
During the meeting.

586
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,698
"ChemStar finalizes plans to expand

587
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,409
"bauxite excavation
in its New Guinea mine.

588
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:39,371
"Stock up 18%."

589
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,289
Bauxite.

590
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,666
It's sparkIe gIue.

591
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,083
- Sparkly.
- Sparkly.

592
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:48,630
NeoDyne. You said to get out.
Do you remember why?

593
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,967
- Do you?
- Yes.

594
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,677
l wrote this down.

595
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:59,557
"Because their pants
were coming down,

596
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,726
"and everyone was going to see
their underwear,

597
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,770
"which was filled with poop."

598
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,814
Yeah, l remember that.

599
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:10,151
Lunchtime today, they were exposed
by the SEC for corporate fraud.

600
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,365
Pants pulled down.
And their books? Total poop!

601
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,576
So l'm asking you again.

602
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,413
How did you know all of this?

603
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:28,211
- Are you insider trading?
- No. No, Tom. No way, never.

604
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,796
Then what are you doing?

605
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:34,467
Where are you getting this information?

606
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:41,141
- So it's the goo-gaa?
- That's how l go there.

607
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:42,767
What do you mean you go there?
Go where?

608
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,478
- To where the princesses live.
- Right. The princesses.

609
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,314
That's Kupida and Qwali
and all of them, right?

610
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:49,649
Qwali's a queen.

611
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,110
Kupida, Mopida and Sopida
are princesses.

612
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,446
- Okay, got you.
- How many times do l have to tell you?

613
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:57,449
Right. Right.
Okay, let me get this right now.

614
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,910
Now, they tell you things
about companies?

615
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,417
Well, you know what,
l got a couple of other companies

616
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,669
l want you to ask them about.
Do you think they'll be up to that?

617
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,254
You can do it yourself.

618
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:15,675
l can ask them myself.
l can go there with you?

619
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,594
Yes, it'll be fun.

620
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:21,723
Okay.

621
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,269
A little more room here.

622
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:27,395
- Now, l do what now?
- Okay.

623
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,813
- l take the goo-gaa.
- You hold it up to your face.

624
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:32,192
- Hold it up to my face.
- And rub in little circles.

625
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:35,612
- Okay, l'm doing it in little circles. Okay.
- Like this.

626
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:39,282
Now you put it over your head, like this.

627
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:40,784
Okay. Now what?

628
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:45,705
And you kind of call them in your mind
while you spin around in circles.

629
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,625
Okay. So l call to them in my mind
while l spin in a circle.

630
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,795
- Yeah.
- Okay, l'm spinning. l'm spinning.

631
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:55,340
Keep spinning. Keep spinning.

632
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:00,553
l'm spinning around.

633
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,972
Are you calling them in your mind?

634
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,474
Yeah.

635
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:08,019
Okay. So am l supposed to just
keep spinning and spinning around?

636
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,688
'Cause l'm a tad bit nauseous now.

637
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,235
Okay, we're there!

638
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,498
lsn't it beautiful?

639
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:36,131
Come on, Daddy!
This way, into the forest!

640
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:40,051
Wow. The princesses
sure live in a beautiful forest.

641
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:42,762
No, because this part's all burned.

642
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,140
Yes, burned from a big forest fire.

643
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:48,310
No, Sopida's dragon burnt it all.

644
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:49,936
Sopida has a dragon?

645
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,064
And if you want to get past her,
you have to sing a song she likes.

646
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,567
l gotta sing a song
to Sopida's dragon, too?

647
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,988
- Hurry. She's coming!
- What? She's coming where?

648
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,115
Sing.

649
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:11,541
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

650
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,959
Sopida's dragon

651
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,045
You gotta do better than that.

652
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:22,969
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

653
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,763
Try higher.

654
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:28,767
Sopida's dragon, please let...

655
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,561
- Higher, like a mouse!
- You want me to have an aneurysm?

656
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:35,565
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

657
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,526
She very hates that.

658
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,488
- l'm with her.
- Try lower, like a frog.

659
00:38:41,571 --> 00:38:43,156
Okay, like a frog.

660
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:47,994
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

661
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,287
Sopida's dragon...

662
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:52,666
She very likes that. She fell asleep.
Come on. Let's go.

663
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:55,085
Now we can go through her cave. Duck!

664
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:57,754
All right, going into the cave.
That's a big, beautiful cave we're in.

665
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,547
No, it's tiny. Can't you see?

666
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:01,675
Okay. My eyes are just adjusting still.
That's why...

667
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:02,884
Jump, Daddy! Jump!

668
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,303
- Jump? Why am l jumping? Okay.
- Jump till you get in!

669
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:06,679
Okay, you're in.

670
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:09,641
- Now you're out.
- Okay. What was l in?

671
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,935
- France!
- l was in France?

672
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,604
- Now, we're on the beach.
- Okay. We're on the beach now.

673
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,524
All right. Great! ls it a nice beach here?

674
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:20,193
Only 'cause mermaids give us
popcorn balls.

675
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:24,572
That's so nice.
Thank you for the popcorn balls!

676
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:30,787
Oh, no! Someone's coming!
Sopida, no! Sopida, you can't!

677
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,205
Can't what? What happened?
What's going on?

678
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:34,791
She doesn't trust you!
She's throwing rocks at you!

679
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:36,376
- Why? Why...
- Duck, Daddy! Duck!

680
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,752
l'm ducking! But what did Daddy do?

681
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,713
Why's she throwing rocks at me?
Don't know what l did.

682
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,297
Up the path!

683
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:43,550
Go back down!

684
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,594
- This way.
- Okay.

685
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,306
Okay, we made it. There they are.

686
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:53,435
Hi, Kupida! Hi, Mopida!

687
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:55,937
- Hey.
- Say something nice.

688
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,108
Hey, Kupida and Mopida, how are you?
Good to see you.

689
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:05,071
My name is Evan Danielson,
and l'm Olivia's dad.

690
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:07,615
They already know who you are.

691
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:09,033
Okay.

692
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:12,871
lt's good to see you.
You look so nice and pretty,

693
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:16,666
the two of you.
My, you really outdid yourself today.

694
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,170
l'm here to ask you. l was wondering...

695
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:24,841
- Are you sure they're...
- Yeah. They're watching.

696
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:28,511
l was gonna... l have some...

697
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:34,934
l want to ask about magnesium futures

698
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:38,897
and their relationship to
Bolivian currency fluctuations.

699
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:45,153
Specifically, these three companies,

700
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:49,616
La Paz Ore and lron,
and lnternational Mining

701
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:52,702
and Weston Metallurgy Limited.

702
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,038
Weston Metallurgy.

703
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,626
These three. l was wondering if you...
Can they see them?

704
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:03,338
l don't want to be in your way.

705
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:05,966
Okay, what are they doing?
Are they talking?

706
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:07,133
- Yeah.
- What are they talking about?

707
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,552
They're talking.

708
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:15,809
Really?

709
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,228
Are you sure?

710
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,188
Okay.

711
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:22,941
Yes, no, no.

712
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:25,735
Did they give a reason?

713
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,616
- Because it's fancy?
- That's exactly right, sir. Fancy.

714
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:34,536
But you're also saying, and this is what
strikes me as contradictory,

715
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,163
that we should abandon all interests
in Weston Metallurgy.

716
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:40,208
- That's correct.
- Because the boliviano is going to...

717
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:41,501
What did he say again?

718
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:44,504
"Be a big, dumb showoff
and fall off its bike."

719
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:48,091
No. Trike.
And nobody likes a big, dumb showoff.

720
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:50,176
Well, no offense, son,
but sounds to me like

721
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,345
a load of what you just stepped in.

722
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,015
Well, that's why we brought
Mr. Whitefeather along, right?

723
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:56,099
What you got, son?

724
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,685
Mr. Rowe, that's funny.

725
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:04,065
The country's entire monetary system
reduced to riding around on a tricycle.

726
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,195
That's a laugh. lt's good to laugh.
lt's good to laugh, man.

727
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:12,740
But there's a time to be serious.

728
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:16,578
We're out here in these holy mountains
that we call Rocky.

729
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:20,123
They're full of predator, prey.

730
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:25,128
The lion of the mountain
knows when to pounce.

731
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:29,382
Better watch out, jack-bunny...

732
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:32,218
- Excuse me, one moment.
- Yeah, okay.

733
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:40,685
Love the new act, man.

734
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,854
- Fun character.
- Thank you.

735
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:45,148
You know, there's an old tribal saying,

736
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,068
"lt's not the paint
that makes the warrior."

737
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:51,529
- What?
- Be well, brother. Be well.

738
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:55,867
Evan, l ever tell you
about Billy Littlesnake,

739
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:58,078
a guy l used to go fishing with
in Montana?

740
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,872
l think you spared me that story.

741
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:02,832
He'd go fishing
where nobody else fished

742
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,752
and always come back with 10 fat trout.

743
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:08,672
Turned out he was stopping off
at the market and buying them.

744
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,674
l'm not insider trading,
if that's what you're saying.

745
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:14,260
Whoa, come on. Let's don't go into
those woods. All right?

746
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:17,722
- There's a lot of bear in those woods.
- Hey, listen. Stop that thing.

747
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:20,183
lf you're going to talk to me,
don't do that thing you do.

748
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:22,477
You want me to speak directly?
l can do that.

749
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,895
Then do it.

750
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:27,357
You want to run with me, Evan,
then run with me.

751
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,193
l accept the challenge. l welcome it.

752
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:34,948
But if l find out that you're stopping off
at the market and buying your fat trout,

753
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:36,157
l'm gonna scalp you.

754
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:38,493
You're gonna scalp me. Literally?

755
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:40,704
lt's gonna feel literal, yeah.

756
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,540
Nice chatting with you, Johnny.

757
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,751
And you, Evan.

758
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:49,587
Hey, Ev, good to see you. Okay.

759
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,508
Let me tell you something
about Johnny Whitefeather.

760
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,761
Under all the show,
l'm good at what l do.

761
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,055
l have a gift. l see trends.

762
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,642
l see patterns.
l see things no one else will ever see.

763
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:05,604
Evan is good, but he's not that good.

764
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:08,398
l want you to find out
where he's getting his information.

765
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:15,780
Sopida's dragon, please let me pass

766
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:17,532
- She's in a good mood tonight.
- That's great.

767
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:20,076
We're all in a good mood.
Let's go through the cave then!

768
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,202
Let's get in the cave,
going through the cave.

769
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:22,829
Ducking down!
lt's a little above my head in the cave.

770
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:25,874
And now we're coming out in France.
We're in France!

771
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:29,085
All right.
And now we're back on the beach again.

772
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:31,296
On the wonderful beach
with Kupida and Mopida.

773
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:34,132
Hello, Kupida and Mopida!
How are the princesses today?

774
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:36,551
- They're good.
- They're good. That's great.

775
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,178
That's great.
Hold on to this for a second, honey.

776
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:39,262
- Yeah.
- Okay, now.

777
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:40,930
Ladies, l want to talk to you
about something.

778
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:44,017
First, let me tell you that those gowns
you're wearing look exquisite.

779
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,769
They look exquisite, ladies.

780
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:50,648
l'll just go right out and say it.
Am l looking in the right direction here?

781
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:52,025
- Yeah.
- Okay.

782
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:55,695
l have a potential client
who is in the medical field

783
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:56,863
and he has a particular company.

784
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:58,782
He was wondering if
he should hold on to that company.

785
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:01,534
And l was wondering if you ladies
had any feelings about that.

786
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:04,621
The company is called VallaTech.

787
00:45:04,704 --> 00:45:07,040
l've just been hearing
so many incredible things about it.

788
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:09,793
We were just wondering
what you princesses thought.

789
00:45:11,586 --> 00:45:14,005
- What do they think?
- Maybe.

790
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:17,717
Maybe?

791
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:23,223
Because Kupida very liked it,
and Mopida very hated it.

792
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:24,683
Okay, so, now what do we do?

793
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:29,979
lf they disagree, we have to see Qwali,
but she's at her mountain castle.

794
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:34,109
Okay. Well,
where's the mountain castle?

795
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:35,986
There.

796
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:42,409
Now, does Qwali have to be out
by this bridge in front of my building,

797
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,536
all these people all over the place,
where everybody can see us?

798
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:46,079
We are not by a bridge.

799
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:47,872
We're at the bottom of
Qwali's mountain!

800
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:50,083
And there's no one here
except you and me,

801
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:53,211
and maybe Qwali,
if she likes the way you dance.

802
00:45:53,294 --> 00:45:55,130
Dance? l have to dance for Qwali, too?

803
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:59,259
Yeah. Because there's a ball tonight,
and she has to see who is the best king.

804
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:01,928
And she will not talk until she does.

805
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,934
Okay. Well, let's do a little dance
for Qwali, then.

806
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:11,813
- Hey, Evan.
- Hey, what's going on, man?

807
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:13,022
How are you...

808
00:46:16,776 --> 00:46:18,820
- Okay. How's that?
- Horrible.

809
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:21,990
You have to get on that thing,
so she can see you.

810
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:24,617
Hey, look. l'm not getting up
on the stage, all right?

811
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:26,327
She won't talk to you.

812
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,538
Okay, l'm gonna go get up on the stage.

813
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:43,261
Oh, come on! She can't see that!
She's way, way up there.

814
00:46:43,344 --> 00:46:46,264
Hey, all right, okay. Take it easy here.

815
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:52,854
More! Bigger!

816
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:56,608
Like that? Like this? No? Yes?

817
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:59,486
To the beat! Can't you hear the music?

818
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:01,613
To the beat? l don't hear the beat.

819
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:02,739
Check it out.

820
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,575
l hear the snickers.

821
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:09,245
lt's spinning music!

822
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:13,708
- Spinning, with your arms out!
- You mean like a waltz?

823
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:18,088
Like a waltz you're talking about. Okay.

824
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:53,957
- That's the best l could do.
- No, it was good. She liked it.

825
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,376
You can go to the ball!

826
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:58,294
Okay, all right.

827
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:00,964
Qwali said it was good.
l can go to the ball.

828
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:06,136
Now, did you ask Qwali
how she feels about VallaTech?

829
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,432
Bottom line, sir,
is that VallaTech is stuck up

830
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:12,475
and doesn't play nice with others.
l say we cut it out.

831
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,643
- Really?
- Yeah.

832
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,186
l know this sounds a little unorthodox,

833
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,563
but here's something else
you need to know.

834
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:18,815
lt has a big butt?

835
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:21,151
A big ol' butt with a shelf on it.

836
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:24,654
l think if you look at DarbaCon's
bloated end-of-the-year rollover...

837
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,240
...you'll see it has pretty hair
and all the boys are looking at it.

838
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:30,326
Well, if he said it wets the bed,
then it wets the bed.

839
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,246
What else did he say?

840
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,499
This little company goes
wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

841
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:40,628
- Did you say, "Wee-wee-wee-wee"?
- Yes. All the way home.

842
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:42,839
- And people are buying that?
- By the millions.

843
00:48:42,922 --> 00:48:45,675
lcky, icky, icky. Gross. Yucky.

844
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,386
Rose, is Evan seeing a psychic?

845
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,221
Not that l'm aware of.

846
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:51,890
lt's fizzy like a soda pop.

847
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:54,517
- ls he a psychic?
- No, l don't believe he is.

848
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:56,645
lt's old enough to start wearing makeup.

849
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:59,105
"Ready for makeup." You feeling this?

850
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:02,734
He says your funds are mature,
and now it's time to start diversifying.

851
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:06,112
Specifically, for A.l.,
what l'm thinking is Argenteeny Pinkini.

852
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,114
- l'm feeling that.
- Hey, l want some of that.

853
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:09,282
Back off, dawg. lt's mine.

854
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:12,494
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! There's enough
lip gloss to go around for everybody.

855
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:17,582
Agroco is a crybaby who always
goes running to Mommy.

856
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,542
- That's your analysis.
- Yes, it is.

857
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:21,961
- And you recommend l...
- Sell.

858
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:24,422
- Sell the crybaby.
- Sell the crybaby.

859
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:25,966
ls this some kind ofjoke, Tom?

860
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,426
- No, Carl. lt's not.
- Because it seems...

861
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,678
- l know, a little different.
- A little?

862
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:33,056
Why don't we hear
what Mr. Whitefeather has to say?

863
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,766
Yes. Johnny, would you like to

864
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:39,354
toss some spear at some tatonka,
or cast some venison into the potlatch?

865
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:43,066
No, l wouldn't.
l'd like to take this seriously.

866
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:45,402
There's a great deal of money
at stake here, Mr. Simons.

867
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:48,780
l think that you should move forward
on Agroco, aggressively.

868
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:50,490
lncrease your holdings.

869
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:52,617
And a gentleman
by the name of Dante D'Enzo

870
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:58,081
happens to concur with my position.
His company, D.D.E. lnvestments,

871
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:02,043
is looking to increase
their holdings by 25%.

872
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:06,631
So l think if we're going to make a move,
we have to do it rather quickly.

873
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:09,259
lf you're ready, l'm ready.
Let's make some money.

874
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,096
That's my "venison."

875
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,307
Evan? Your thoughts?

876
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:24,107
Well, l think that's interesting.
l think that's very interesting.

877
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,568
Very, very, very interesting

878
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:29,863
that Dante D'Enzo would say in
and l would say out.

879
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:31,739
That's interesting, l think.

880
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,701
What l'm going to do now
is l'm gonna go to the restroom,

881
00:50:34,784 --> 00:50:37,162
and l'm gonna think this through,
and l'm gonna re-crunch some numbers

882
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:39,289
and get right back to you, gentlemen.
Excuse me.

883
00:50:40,498 --> 00:50:41,583
So...

884
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,387
These look great.

885
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:55,972
Evan?

886
00:50:56,056 --> 00:51:01,102
- Hey. Hey. What are you doing here?
- Flyers for Saturday. The Fall Sing.

887
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,812
We're on lunch,
so l'm just dropping them off.

888
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:05,273
- Hey, how you doing? l'm Rick.
- Rick.

889
00:51:05,356 --> 00:51:07,150
Rick's son, Henry, is in kindergarten.

890
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:10,403
Yeah, so you're Rick.
You're the sculpture, sculptor.

891
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:13,323
l saw your little thing that you did
at the Comerica building.

892
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:15,575
- Yeah.
- Very metallic and pointy.

893
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:17,077
And unfairly criticized, l might add.

894
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,537
Look, l got some last-minute
parenting thing l gotta do with Olivia.

895
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,706
Nice meeting you, Rick.

896
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,666
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt. lt's Mr. Danielson.

897
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,834
- Can l talk to Olivia for one second?
- Sure.

898
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:26,628
l'll be brief. Olivia,
come talk to Daddy, please?

899
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:27,754
Hi, everybody.

900
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:31,007
l have some quick questions for Qwali
about Agroco. Where should we go?

901
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:32,467
Come on. Come on. Come on.

902
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,261
Okay. Did you bring the goo-gaa?
All right. Okay.

903
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:39,224
l knew you would. Okay, perfect, perfect,
perfect. Blanket up. Rub in fast circles.

904
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:42,602
l smell something burning.
lt's Sopida's dragon! Here she is!

905
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:45,438
Mopida and Kupida! Good to see you!
Time to dance!

906
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:58,326
- That's it.
- What are they doing?

907
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,578
l have no idea.

908
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:04,165
- She's really sure?
- And she says you agree with her.

909
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:06,084
- l do?
- Don't you?

910
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:10,505
- Yeah, l guess l do, sort of.
- Okay.

911
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:11,965
Okay, give me a high five.

912
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:13,133
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

913
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:15,468
Put this back in. All right, tell no one!

914
00:52:18,054 --> 00:52:22,684
So you're saying that Dante D'Enzo
is totally wrong on this.

915
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:23,810
Yes.

916
00:52:23,893 --> 00:52:26,187
And your inner child says that

917
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:29,482
we should completely
pull out ofAgroco.

918
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,317
Yes.

919
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:35,363
Okay. l think l'm going to go with

920
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:38,158
what Mr. Whitefeather
has put together here.

921
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:40,910
lt seems better.

922
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:46,333
- l am going to have the venison.
- lt's a savory meat.

923
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:51,838
Doctor's office.

924
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:55,634
l know you say Qwali's never wrong,
but l think we both were this time.

925
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:59,763
lfjust Mopida says it
orjust Kupida says it,

926
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:05,352
it could be wrong.
But if Qwali says it, it's never wrong.

927
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:08,855
Well, l think
she kind of was wrong this time.

928
00:53:08,938 --> 00:53:11,149
- She was not.
- Yes, she was.

929
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:12,650
- Was not.
- Yes, she was.

930
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,152
Not.

931
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:17,030
Actually, not.

932
00:53:17,113 --> 00:53:19,657
Ha, ha, you're just trying to get me
to say "was."

933
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,868
No, she really wasn't wrong.

934
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:24,329
D'Enzo pulled out ofAgroco,
which is down 12%.

935
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:26,915
"Agroco cries foul,
hides behind parent company."

936
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:31,544
Crybaby runs to Mommy.

937
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,344
- How are you doing this?
- lt's easy.

938
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:41,805
You just overlap them
and it makes a pyramid.

939
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,811
Olivia? We're ready for you, sweetie.
Time for your shot.

940
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:54,025
You did a really good job in there.
l'm really proud of you.

941
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:56,653
For that, we're gonna get
a special ice cream treat.

942
00:53:56,736 --> 00:53:59,197
- l cried, though.
- But you did good.

943
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:00,824
You see, when l was your age
l had to get a shot,

944
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:03,868
l was running, screaming,
"Don't stab me! Don't stab me!"

945
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:10,784
