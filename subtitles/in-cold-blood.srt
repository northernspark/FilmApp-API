Excuse me.

3
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,400
Pa?

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,964
You all right, Pa?

5
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,441
- You're up early.
- I got a big day ahead.

6
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,409
I wish you didn't have to go.

7
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,106
I promised to help this friend.

8
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,144
Goddamn outhouse.

9
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,787
One of these days soon,
I'm changing all that.

10
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,585
Damn soon.

11
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,190
You drive careful now.

12
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,517
Young man? Young man.
I'm terribly sorry.

13
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,842
Ma'am, can I have a root beer?

14
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,183
- Anything else to go with that?
- Some aspirins, please.

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,594
You sure got a perfect day for it.

25
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,354
- What's that?
- Hunting pheasants.

26
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,333
Yes, indeedy.

Them birds don't know it,
but this is their last day on Earth.

29
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,456
Good morning, Daddy.

30
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,286
- Well, you're up early.
- I've got a furious day ahead.

31
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,537
'Morning, Dad.

32
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,318
- Thought maybe I smelled smoke.
- Yeah.

33
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,353
Me, too. Could be a leaky valve.

34
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,452
Could be.

35
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,254
Peppermints before breakfast
might stunt your growth.

36
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,294
Daddy, phone.

37
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,200
It's the insurance man.

38
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,527
This afternoon, anytime before dark.

39
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,736
Hello?

40
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,947
I want to call
the Kansas State Penitentiary.

41
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,078
Person-to-person. Rev. James Post.

42
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,250
Rev. James Post.

43
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,693
My name is...

44
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,463
Perry Smith.
He'll be checking in sometime tomorrow.

45
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:51,196
- Can I see the room, please?
- Ain't you working today?

46
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,598
Now, ain't you?

47
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,341
Hello.

48
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,445
Perry.

49
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,382
Of course, I remember you.

50
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,018
Kansas City?

51
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,651
Missouri.

52
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,093
I'm at the bus terminal.

53
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,690
I'm waiting for Willie Jay.

54
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,600
Did something hold up his parole?

55
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,671
- I was supposed to meet him right here.
- Perry, think.

56
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,633
You've already broken parole
by quitting your job.

57
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,311
You'll break it again
if you step into Kansas.

58
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,574
Whatever you do,
don't cross that river into Kansas.

59
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,083
Can you tell me where he went?

60
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,390
Please, Jim.

61
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,324
It's very important.

62
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,561
Maybe the most important thing in my life.

63
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,306
Go back. Why not see your father?

64
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,521
'Morning, Ma.

65
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,550
Daddy, you know Jolene?

66
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,424
I promised to teach her
how to bake a cherry pie.

67
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,226
- Sounds serious.
- She insists on today.

68
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,995
That makes it practically a catastrophe.

69
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,131
Because I also promised
to help Roxy with her trumpet solo.

70
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,902
And errands for Mother in Garden City,
lunch with Susan...

71
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:40,139
Suppose I take care
of your mother's errands?

72
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,344
Thank you, Daddy.

73
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,995
<i>Also provided for your convenience,</i>
<i>at the baggage counter...</i>

74
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,367
<i>... are identification tags.</i>

75
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,798
<i>This is your last call...</i>

76
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,105
<i>... for Buckner, Bluffington, Lexington,</i>
<i>Waverly, Marshall...</i>

77
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,580
<i>... and intermediate flights.</i>

78
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,718
<i>Now boarding at door number six.</i>

79
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,411
Stick 'em up!

80
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,185
- Hey, buddy.
- How long have you been standing there?

81
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,484
Long enough to catch your late late show.

82
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,625
- Just between you and I.
- You and me.

83
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,151
How come you always go into a trance
every time you look in the mirror?

84
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,630
Just like you was looking
at some gorgeous piece of butt.

85
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,229
What in the hell is in here?

86
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,967
Concrete?

87
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,100
That's all my stuff. Books, letters, songs.

88
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,642
Souvenirs from Korea.

89
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,644
And our ticket to fame and fortune.

90
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,013
I got a secret map that's going to lead us...

91
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,054
...straight to the sunken treasure
of Captain Cortés.

92
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:06,023
$60 million in Spanish gold,
off the coast of Mexico.

93
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,524
So, that's why that map's
so frigging heavy.

94
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,254
Welcome back to Kansas, buddy.
The heart of America.

95
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,130
The land of wheat, corn, bibles, and...

96
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,333
...natural gas.

97
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,699
That map's not as heavy as yours,
but it's the real thing.

98
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:29,507
And it's gonna get us $10,000 by tonight.

99
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:34,008
Four hundred miles west of here,
Big Daddy Clutter's place.

100
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,183
That's the layout. The works.

101
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,419
Somewhere in that office,
in one little old safe.

102
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,895
And inside that safe, $10,000, maybe more.

103
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,164
You've seen it?

104
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,462
The safe!

105
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,800
Right after you left the zoo,
a new guy moved into the cell.

106
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,569
Floyd Wells,
serving three to five for robbery.

107
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,237
He once worked for Clutter. He saw it.

108
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,010
And that's your perfect score?

109
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,044
Baby, it's a cinch.

110
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:10,488
I promise you, honey,
we'll blast hair all over them walls.

111
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,128
- Hello, Roxy.
- 'Morning, Mr. Clutter.

112
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,436
I think Nancy's expecting you.

113
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,746
You want to watch it, boy.
You'll end up an aspirin junkie.

114
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,446
Been one for seven years.
Got the habit in the hospital.

115
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,652
Doctors.

116
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,952
They made a dwarf out of me.

117
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,429
Doctors and lawyers. What do they care?

118
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,929
Ever see a millionaire
fry in the electric chair?

119
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,332
Hell, no.

120
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,307
There's two kinds of laws, honey:

121
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,705
One for the rich and one for the poor.

122
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,480
Look at me.

123
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,015
I crack up my car,
wake up in a charity ward...

124
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,984
...and don't even recognize myself.

125
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,552
I hate to count how much classy pussy
that's cost me.

126
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,393
They left you a wonderful smile, though.

127
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,159
Yeah, the all-American boy.

128
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,575
That was stupid.

129
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,112
Stealing a lousy pack of razor blades,
to prove what?

130
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,679
Everybody steals something sometime.

131
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,687
It's the national pastime, baby.
Stealing and cheating.

132
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,590
If they caught every cheating wife
and tax chiseler...

133
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,132
...the whole country
would be behind prison walls.

134
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,067
- Where are the black stockings?
- They didn't have black.

135
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,661
- Stop someplace else.
- Where?

136
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,572
- A Catholic hospital.
- Sure.

137
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,635
We'll just barge in like it was
a goddamn five-and-dime.

138
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:24,247
Sister, sweetie, we gotta have
some black stockings to hide our face.

139
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,806
Okay, forget it.

140
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:29,147
Anyway, nuns are bad luck.

141
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,218
Kind of sexy, though.

142
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,691
You wouldn't think so if you'd lived
in one of those orphan homes...

143
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,389
...with those black widows always at you.

144
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,922
Always sneaking up in the dark,
spying while you sleep.

145
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,498
Hitting you with a flashlight
for wetting the bed.

146
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,505
That's the first time
I was saved by the yellow bird.

147
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,271
The what?

148
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,301
Sort of a parrot.

149
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,708
Taller than Jesus.

150
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,882
Brilliant yellow, like a sunflower.

151
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,177
It attacked those nuns
like an avenging angel.

152
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,583
The nuns begged for mercy.

153
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,260
But the yellow bird
slaughtered them anyway.

154
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,923
Then the bird folded me in its wings...

155
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,932
...and lifted me up to paradise.

156
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,264
That's one hell of a bird
to have on your side.

157
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,337
Anyway, that's why I have
an aversion to nuns...

158
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,381
...and God and religion.

159
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,518
Forget it.
Black stockings are a waste of time.

160
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,786
No one's gonna remember us
because we're leaving no witnesses.

161
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,859
How about staying at our place tonight?

162
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,461
Frozen stiff TV dinners on trays...

163
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,129
...spaghetti, macaroni or pizza.

164
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,128
- Sounds irresistible.
- I'll tell Mom.

165
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,934
- Golly, Sue. <i>C"est impossible.</i>
<i>- Pourquoi, chérie?</i>

166
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,442
- Bobby's coming over.
- I'll pick you up for church tomorrow.

167
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,875
9:00 sharp.

168
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,356
A full day's work
deserves a full-course dinner.

169
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,723
The condemned ate a hearty meal.

170
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,427
I don't know what they ate,
but tonight, cheeseburgers.

171
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,026
Tomorrow?

172
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,699
Mexico.

173
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,570
- Fabulous Mexico.
- Land of the hot <i>tamales</i>.

174
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,738
Gold country.

175
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:12,049
Remember Bogart
in <i>Treasure of the Sierra Madre</i>?

176
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,644
We could get us a couple of <i>burros</i>.

177
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,149
Some tools.

178
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,021
Slow down, honey.
I don't know gold dust from diarrhea.

179
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,424
Well, I do.

180
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,159
My old man prospected for gold in Alaska.

181
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,101
He taught me all the ins and outs.

182
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,132
Yeah. And we end up nuts.

183
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,169
No gold, nothing. Just like in the movie.

184
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,640
You never meant it...

185
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,353
...about going to Mexico, did you?
Did you?

186
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,326
Sure, baby.

187
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,921
Sure we're going.

188
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,667
But first we gotta dig up some capital.
Like tonight.

189
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,933
$5,000 a piece, for one hour's work.

190
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,804
- May I take your orders?
- Two cheeseburgers, please.

191
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,483
Getting insured is like...

192
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,757
...well, when you wash your car,
it always rains.

193
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,826
Know what we call this
in the insurance game?

194
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,332
The solemn moment.

195
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,061
I guess when a man makes out a policy
or takes out his last will...

196
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:44,131
...it's only natural to think about mortality.

197
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:49,138
Herb, as of this minute,
your life is worth $40,000.

198
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,873
In case of accidental death,
double indemnity.

199
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,282
New York Life wishes you
a very long and very healthy life.

200
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,586
- And so do I.
- And so do I.

201
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,361
That waitress.
Nice piece of blonde chicken.

202
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,970
Why'd you pick me for this job?

203
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,138
A perfect score needs perfect partners.

204
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,407
Together we're a perfect fit.

205
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,839
It's your score. Where do I fit in?

206
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,281
I got you figured for a natural-born killer.

207
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,459
Or did you lie about that punk in Vegas?

208
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,559
No.

209
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,760
Why did you kill him?

210
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,694
No special reason. Just for the hell of it.

211
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,432
That's the best reason of all.

212
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,241
Back there, you wanted to kill me.

213
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,467
Just for a second, right?

214
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,511
It passed.

215
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,912
Hair-trigger temper.

216
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,409
Somebody crosses you, voom!

217
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,220
Yes, sir. You've got the gift, boy.

218
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,687
Remember the chaplain's clerk, Willie Jay?

219
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,895
- The guy you painted to look like Jesus?
- He said the same thing:

220
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,491
"Unstable, explosive."

221
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,169
He is a flaming faggot.

222
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,472
He has a brilliant mind.

223
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,634
Then how come
he got caught stealing five times?

224
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,674
- He was the best friend I ever had.
- I'm the only friend you got now.

225
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:34,152
Friend to the end, for better or worse.

226
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,979
Till death do us part?

227
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,885
All we need is a ring, sugar.

228
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,605
Is that Bobby?

229
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,252
Look at that land, will you?

230
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,128
Oil money, gas money, wheat money.

231
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,298
Share the wealth, baby.

232
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,072
- How does it feel?
- What?

233
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,669
Being a father.

234
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,472
Great.

235
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:45,474
- Your kids, you love them?
- I'm their father, ain't I?

236
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,610
I didn't ask if you were their father.
I asked if you love them.

237
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,149
I'm crazy about 'em.

238
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,919
- But you left them.
- Left their mother.

239
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,225
Okay. She left me.

240
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,297
There was this piece of tail,
nothing serious.

241
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,664
Just a quickie in the back seat.

242
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,332
She blew the whistle on me.
Said I knocked her up.

243
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,803
That's how I got to be a two-time loser.

244
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,439
You ditched the kids for her.

245
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:18,174
Jesus, baby.
I had to do the right thing by her, didn't I?

246
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,544
Well? Didn't I?

247
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,955
Yeah.

248
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,894
- 'Night!
- See you tomorrow, Bobby.

249
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,882
- How much longer?
- Seven miles.

250
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,044
Fill her up with regular.

251
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,212
Want some candy?

252
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,414
No.

253
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,227
You okay?

254
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,119
I'm fine.

255
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,628
Coming?

256
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,499
Let's go.

257
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:31,104
<i>News from the Associated Press,</i>
<i>NBC, and the</i> Garden City Telegram.

258
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,677
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Goodnight, Son.

259
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,147
<i>Winds from the south</i>
<i>at about 15 miles per hour.</i>

260
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:43,859
<i>The Garden City Sale Company reported</i>
<i>3,273 cattle at the auction yesterday.</i>

261
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,494
'Night.

262
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:50,466
<i>... calves went from $26.50 to $30.</i>
<i>However, very few reached the $30 mark.</i>

263
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,299
<i>The medium and good kinds</i>
<i>sold as high as $26.50...</i>

264
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,941
Look at that spread.

265
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,810
Don't tell me this guy ain't loaded.

266
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,863
Let's pull out of here.

267
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,625
Now, before it's too late.

268
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,823
- Pa?
- Maybe they're still asleep.

269
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,662
Nancy?

270
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,542
Don't touch it.

271
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,052
Don't touch anything.

272
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,388
Been up there?

273
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,901
My God.

274
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,322
There's two more in the basement.

275
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,947
I just saw two ambulances
going up to Clutter's.

276
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,106
I just wondering what's happening.

277
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:57,774
<i>The Sheriff placed an urgent call</i>
<i>to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.</i>

278
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:02,939
<i>In Topeka, Logan Sanford, KBI chief,</i>
<i>assigned four men to the Clutter case.</i>

279
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:07,681
<i>They are agents Dewey, Nye,</i>
<i>Duntz, and Church.</i>

280
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:13,053
- What happened to the basketball game?
- It got interrupted. Terrible thing, that.

281
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,458
I've never been so hungry in my whole life.

282
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:21,122
<i>Agent Alvin Dewey arrived</i>
<i>at the Clutter house...</i>

283
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,667
<i>... in advance of the other KBI men.</i>

284
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:28,172
<i>Mr. Dewey, resident of Garden City,</i>
<i>was placed in charge of the case.</i>

285
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:28,695
<i>Mr. Dewey, resident of Garden City,</i>
<i>was placed in charge of the case.</i>

286
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,143
Were all four tied with the same cord?

287
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,810
All tied with the same square knot.

288
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,713
Used by anybody
who works with livestock.

289
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:43,716
- Find any shell casings?
- Nope.

290
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,020
Which means that...

291
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,125
...you can bet
they didn't leave any fingerprints either.

292
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,662
Al.

293
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,325
- This is the housekeeper.
- Thank you for coming.

294
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,269
- Are they still...
- No, no, ma'am.

295
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,807
They've been taken to the funeral home.

296
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,405
Now, if you'll just look around
with Mr. Church here...

297
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,446
...to see if anything is missing...

298
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:12,574
They never hurt anybody. Why them?

299
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,093
Al, you knew Clutter.

300
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,429
Did he have a safe?

301
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,229
Keep a lot of cash on hand?

302
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,402
The old Kansas myth.

303
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,433
Every farmer with a good spread
is supposed to have...

304
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,479
...a hidden black box somewhere
filled with money.

305
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:46,347
No. Herb paid everything by check.
Even a $2 haircut.

306
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,713
Well, then why...

307
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,221
...if they're going
to shoot them all anyway, why...

308
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,686
...did they first cut Clutter's throat?

309
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,131
Why did they first put him
on a soft mattress box?

310
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,861
To make him comfy?

311
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,398
And why the pillow under the boy's head?

312
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,370
We keep saying "they."
It could have been one man.

313
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,541
A madman.

314
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,082
This picture was taken
with a time exposure.

315
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,753
It shows only what the eye saw.

316
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,486
This picture was taken with a flashbulb.

317
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,961
That's a different pair of shoes.

318
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,626
Yeah.

319
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,396
We know there were at least two of them.

320
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:44,239
You won't see it there.
The flash made them stand out in the dust.

321
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,004
- You develop those pictures yourself?
- Yes.

322
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,705
- Newspaper boys seen this?
- Not yet.

323
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,709
Keep it that way.

324
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,522
Al, when can we see the Clutter home?

325
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,683
Why were the men killed in the basement?

326
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,989
I'll talk facts, not theories.

327
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,424
It happened around 2:00 a.m.

328
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,928
All four were apparently killed
by the same weapon.

329
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,633
Shotgun, 12-gauge.
Mr. Clutter's throat was cut.

330
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,870
Before he was shot?

331
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,534
Probably.

332
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,707
All four were tied
with the same nylon sash-cord...

333
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,274
...sold in most hardware stores.

334
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,447
And their mouths were taped.

335
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,115
How were they tied? What kind of knots?

336
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,749
Can we see police pictures?

337
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,760
- Find the murder weapon?
- Not yet.

338
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,355
- Any clues or fingerprints?
- Lots. All belong to the family.

339
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,799
They say that Nancy's boyfriend
is a prime suspect.

340
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,032
- Is that what they say?
- He was the last one to see them alive.

341
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,332
- Except the killers.
- Then there were more than one?

342
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,378
- Were the women sexually molested?
- The coroner says not.

343
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,606
- Why didn't the dog bark?
- He didn't bark?

344
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:00,378
- Nobody heard him.
- Nobody heard the gunshots either.

345
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,381
Mr. Dewey, in your opinion...

346
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,219
...do you think it could have been
an inside job, sir?

347
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,988
- Why didn't Mr. Clutter resist?
- Mr. Dewey, just a moment, Mr. Dewey.

348
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,423
What about the hired man?

349
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,989
His check was made out for $1,707.

350
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,060
Mr. Clutter's first premium
on a straight life policy...

351
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,230
...worth $40,000.

352
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,608
Double indemnity makes it $80,000.

353
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,940
And that makes it a strange coincidence.

354
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,881
And that's all it is, a coincidence.

355
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,946
I didn't catch your name.

356
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,317
Bill Jensen, <i>Weekly</i> magazine.

357
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,394
If you're not here to write news,
what is your interest?

358
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,430
Fairly basic.

359
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,863
What's basic about a stupid...

360
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,229
...senseless crime?

361
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:59,632
A violent, unknown force
destroys a decent, ordinary family.

362
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,039
No clues. No logic.

363
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,643
Makes us all feel frightened. Vulnerable.

364
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,119
Murder's no mystery. Only the motive.

365
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,019
Got one?

366
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,688
I smoke too much.

367
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,560
How'd they enter the house?
A key? Force a window?

368
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,369
Probably just walked in.

369
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,402
- Don't people around here lock doors?
- They will tonight.

370
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,309
I know something's wrong here.

371
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,577
I feel it.

372
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,744
I don't know what it is, but...

373
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,514
Mr. Clutter never allowed smoking
in the house.

374
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,185
Sorry.

375
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,022
Something.

376
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,821
But of course.

377
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,557
The radio!

378
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,566
Kenyon always listened
to the news and weather...

379
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,398
...before he went to bed.

380
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,628
But where's his radio?

381
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,604
<i>Since the night of horror, two days ago...</i>

382
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:08,868
<i>... few people are seen on the streets</i>
<i>of Garden City after dark.</i>

383
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,841
<i>To date, no clues have been uncovered.</i>

384
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,617
<i>No clues whatever.</i>

385
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:20,419
<i>It was generally known that Clutter</i>
<i>never had large sums of cash on hand.</i>

386
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,721
<i>No expensive jewels.</i>

387
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,585
<i>Nor even a steel safe in which to...</i>

388
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,892
Perry, baby,
if you don't want that burger...

389
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,298
You and your hotshot
prison buddy Floyd Wells.

390
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,367
Big, fat safe in the wall.

391
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,743
$10,000. "A cinch."

392
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,244
Okay, Floyd's a jerk.
But we scored, didn't we?

393
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,815
Perfecto.

394
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,450
You call an 800-mile drive...

395
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,553
...and the rest of it, for 43...

396
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:00,028
...lousy dollars, you call that perfect?

397
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:01,622
And that!

398
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,100
You don't believe that con
about no clues do you?

399
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,037
You worry too much.

400
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,297
How are them cowboys
gonna connect us? Remember?

401
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,176
No witnesses.

402
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,344
I know one.

403
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,952
You. You're a witness.

404
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:32,262
Jesus, kid. For a minute,
I thought you blew your cork.

405
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,531
You're so right.

406
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,161
We're the only ones who saw it...

407
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,799
...and that, honey, is our big ace.

408
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,603
Because if they can't split us apart,
they can't get a confession.

409
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,647
And if they can't get a confession,
they got nothing.

410
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,176
Next move...

411
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,846
...Mexico.

412
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,750
- Once we beat it out of the country.
- On what?

413
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,286
$43 and a smile and bullshit?

414
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:08,525
You guessed it, Chief.
It's the smile that does it.

415
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,732
Like it says in the commercials:

416
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,896
"The family that sticks together
lives forever."

417
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,050
<i>Officers investigating the slaying</i>
<i>have appealed to the public...</i>

418
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,178
<i>... for help in solving the crime.</i>

419
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:35,123
<i>A Kansas paper,</i> The Hutchison News<i>,</i>
<i>has offered a reward for any information...</i>

420
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,888
<i>... leading to the capture</i>
<i>and conviction of the person...</i>

421
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,931
<i>... or persons, guilty of the Clutter murders.</i>

422
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,558
<i>A reward of $1,000.</i>

423
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:50,262
What about the reward?
That's right, $1,000.

424
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,412
Yes, sir. Where are you calling from?

425
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,682
Yeah. Go ahead.

426
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,374
Who?

427
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,084
How do you know he was a foreigner?

428
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,058
- I see. Thank you very much, sir.
- Another tip?

429
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,065
He says he saw a foreigner running.

430
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,037
How does a foreigner run, anyway?

431
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,835
Just how many people
have tried to claim this reward?

432
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,705
Just about everybody.

433
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,077
A mysterious stranger did it.

434
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,983
Hired killers did it.
A jealous neighbor did it.

435
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,047
Seems like the only one
who didn't do it is the butler.

436
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,454
Any luck?

437
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,389
None of the Clutters had shoes
with a cat's paw.

438
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:47,757
No diamond pattern, either.
Insurance money goes to the family.

439
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,460
And this, Nancy Clutter's.

440
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,795
Found it hidden in the toe of her slipper.

441
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,273
Something must've scared her.

442
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,706
All of which brings us back
to the motive of robbery.

443
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,708
I can believe one man might work up
enough rage to do it.

444
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,047
But two?

445
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:13,018
Who would kill four people in cold blood
for a radio...

446
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,459
...a pair of binoculars and $40 in cash?

447
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:22,396
These days? Take your pick
on any crowded street.

448
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,435
You ever hang any paper?

449
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,404
I couldn't cash a check even if it was good.

450
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,983
Easy, baby. Casual.

451
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,225
Excuse me. My name's Hickock.
Richie. And you're?

452
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,927
Sharp. Luke Sharp.

453
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,832
I'll bet in school
they called you Look Sharp.

454
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,935
See that gentleman over there?

455
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,739
Would you believe a runt like that
is getting married?

456
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:13,374
Well, maybe he ain't any Fred Astaire
but he's my best friend...

457
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,913
...and I'm his best man.

458
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:20,123
My wedding present to him
is going to be what you might call...

459
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,623
...his trousseau.

460
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,502
Ideal shade for an informal ceremony,
don't you think?

461
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:35,697
Perfectly ideal.

462
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,503
Of course,
we are a tiny bit oddly proportioned.

463
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:42,204
I mean, the upper torso is so large
compared to the legs.

464
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:46,277
I'm terribly sorry.

465
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,975
He's not ashamed of them scars.

466
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,784
They gave him the Bronze Star in Korea.

467
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:57,350
Luke, have you ever been to Eden Roc?
In Miami Beach.

468
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,554
That's where the happy couple
is shacking up for their honeymoon.

469
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,657
Two weeks all paid up.
Surprise gift from the folks.

470
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,065
He's a very lucky man.

471
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,432
He deserves it.

472
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:12,273
And with these, $192.70.

473
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:15,204
Would you like them wrapped
and taken to your car?

474
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,804
No hurry.
Deliver them when the suit is ready.

475
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,175
Oh, no!

476
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,085
Four silly dollars.

477
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,988
We're awfully sorry.

478
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,456
We'll have to come back some other time.

479
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,060
I'd gladly give you a check.

480
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,721
But then you hardly know me.

481
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:37,096
We're really grateful for your courtesy.

482
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,034
- Lf it's a personal check, perhaps.
- You're sure?

483
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,039
- I wouldn't want to inconvenience you.
- Perfectly all right.

484
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,734
Which bank would you like?

485
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,833
It's immaterial, I'm sure.

486
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:52,147
My driver's license, identity card,
insurance card, country club...

487
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,777
She's a private number.

488
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,016
- Was that $192?
- And $0.70.

489
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,923
Would you care if I...

490
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,925
- Never mind.
- No, please.

491
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,820
Well, I could use a little loose change.

492
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:06,726
I see.

493
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:10,233
Suppose I just make this out for $280...

494
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,465
...and $0.70, of course.

495
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,870
Well, I suppose.

496
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:19,275
Mr. Sharp, you're a brick.

497
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,579
You're good. You're really good.

498
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,715
Smooth. No sweat. No strain.

499
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,055
- You're an artist, boy.
- Right.

500
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:36,224
If you're getting married,
you need a wedding ring.

501
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,124
- Why not two of them?
- Why not?

502
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:42,063
Cameras, diamond rings, TV sets
are the easiest things to hock or sell.

503
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,814
You know, there's got to be
something wrong with us...

504
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,412
...to do what we did.

505
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:43,484
Nobody, but nobody,
ever gets away with a thing like that.

506
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,289
Will you shut up about it?

507
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,954
I can't shake this feeling
that we forgot something that night.

508
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,401
I don't know what,
something that belongs to us.

509
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,634
You want to go back to that house
and look for whatever the hell it is?

510
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,839
Because that would make us
not only crazy, but insane.

511
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:28,870
Any luck?

512
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,840
If they didn't leave any fingerprints,
you can be sure...

513
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,968
...they didn't leave any murder weapons.

514
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,803
People who used to work for Clutter,
going back 15 years.

515
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,673
Hired men,
people he used to do business with...

516
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,679
- Just keep talking.
- Upstairs?

517
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,513
Don't look up.

518
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,719
- See something?
- I'm not sure.

519
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:24,016
Now you take the office side
and I'll go around the kitchen side.

520
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,996
It's true, really true.

521
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,929
We're on our way
and never coming back, never.

522
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,033
And no regrets.

523
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,435
For you. You are leaving nothing.

524
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,337
What about my old man? And my mother.

525
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,840
They'll still be there
when my checks start bouncing.

526
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,403
It's nice the way
you think about your folks.

527
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,608
I'm a real thoughtful bastard.

528
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,524
'Morning, Bess. Coffee?

529
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,998
Hey, Alvin,
that prowler at the Clutter house...

530
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,165
...get a confession out of him yet?
- Yep.

531
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:47,506
His confession proved he didn't do it:
Escaped mental patient.

532
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:51,206
If he's the wrong one,
why in hell don't you find the right one?

533
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:55,308
I've got a house full of women
who are afraid to go to the toilet alone.

534
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,846
Bunch of gabby old women gassing away,
scaring each other.

535
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:05,458
Somebody with a grudge done it.
Somebody who hated the Clutters.

536
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,726
Nobody asked you.
Nobody hated the Clutters.

537
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,394
Leastways, nobody that knew them.

538
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,594
Phone.

539
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:19,538
If this can happen to a decent,
God-fearing family...

540
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,871
...who's safe anymore?

541
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,940
Hello?

542
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,675
- From here?
- No, from Topeka. It's urgent!

543
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,446
Okay, Mr. Sandrew.

544
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,691
Tell Alvin it's a prisoner. In Lancing.

545
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:42,021
Get me a rap sheet on this man, please.
He mentioned the Clutter case.

546
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:46,561
He wouldn't say any more
unless he was called out of the cellblock.

547
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,599
I have the warden on the other phone now.
Might be a break.

548
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,473
If it is, I'll be out to Garden City tonight
with the tape.

549
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,305
No, phone's too risky.

550
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,346
Hello? Yes.

551
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:06,648
"KSP 1-4-3-2-3. Floyd Wells."

552
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,923
<i>- I first met him in the penitentiary.</i>
<i>- Hickock?</i>

553
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,626
<i>Yes, sir. We shared the same cell.</i>

554
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,399
<i>Go ahead, Floyd.</i>

555
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,832
<i>We swapped life stories and I told him...</i>

556
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,398
<i>... how I once worked</i>
<i>for a farmer named Clutter.</i>

557
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,334
<i>Did you work for him?</i>

558
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,770
<i>Yes, sir. Ten, eleven years ago.</i>

559
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,706
<i>Dick wanted to know if Mr. Clutter</i>
<i>was rich and I said, "Well...</i>

560
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:39,187
<i>"...sometimes it cost him $10,000</i>
<i>a week to run his operation."</i>

561
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,990
<i>After that, Dick never let up.</i>
<i>Just kept asking questions.</i>

562
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,661
<i>How many was in the family?</i>
<i>Did Clutter keep a safe?</i>

563
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,665
<i>Dick said how he was going</i>
<i>to rob the Clutter place...</i>

564
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,098
<i>... him and his buddy.</i>

565
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,659
<i>And how he was gonna kill</i>
<i>all the witnesses.</i>

566
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,562
<i>I just never believed him.</i>
<i>I thought it was just...</i>

567
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,100
What took him so long to speak up?

568
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,871
Afraid of other prisoners.
Issue a pickup warrant.

569
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,075
All points bulletin.

570
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:08,413
We better make it for parole violation,
passing bad checks.

571
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,816
If they know they're wanted for murder...

572
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:14,015
- Yeah.
- The question is why they did it.

573
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,054
Why did Cain kill Abel? And who cares?

574
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,327
They did it, and they'll swing for it.

575
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,964
If they did it and if we can prove it.

576
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,330
When we cross this bridge,
we're in Mexico.

577
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,206
Free, clear and safe.

578
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:37,436
Fabulous Mexico.

579
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,460
Mr. Smith?

580
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,828
Mr. Tex Smith?

581
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,770
- Cops?
- Kansas Bureau of Investigation.

582
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,576
Is this your son, Perry?

583
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,922
Yep, that's him all right.

584
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,286
Gets his looks from his mother.

585
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:29,554
Part Cherokee.

586
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,130
- Will you have some coffee?
- When did you see him last?

587
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,298
- Couple of years ago.
- In prison?

588
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:40,704
I was just fixing to make some grub.
You want some eats?

589
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:45,037
He was in for three and a half years.
He's been out on parole for six months.

590
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:48,276
Well, then I guess I haven't seen him
for five or six years.

591
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:51,320
That's not surprising though.
He's a lone wolf just like me.

592
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,322
You can rest easy on one thing sure...

593
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,722
...you won't be having
any more trouble with Perry.

594
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,726
He's learned his lesson for sure.

595
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,456
When he wrote me from prison,
I wrote him back pronto.

596
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,828
"Boy, you take your punishment
with a smile.

597
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,367
"I didn't raise you to steal,
so don't expect me to cry...

598
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,869
"...because you got it tough
behind the bars."

599
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:10,462
Perry's no fool. He knows when he's beat.

600
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,338
You fellows have got him whipped forever.
The law's the boss.

601
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,777
He knows the difference
between right and wrong.

602
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,747
I taught my kids a golden rule:
Always tell the truth...

603
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,410
...wash in the morning,
be sober and independent.

604
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,850
I showed him how.

605
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,514
How to prospect, how to trap fur,
how to carpenter, how to bake bread...

606
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,217
...how to be his own boss.

607
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:33,323
Yes, he's a chip off the old block, all right.

608
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:38,426
I never had no trouble with my kids,
not as long as Flo and me was together.

609
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,570
But she wanted the wild life.

610
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:45,471
So she took the kids and ran off.
Turned them against me.

611
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:46,804
All but Perry.

612
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,606
I don't know what got into her.

613
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,409
She started drinking.
Turned into a hopeless drunk.

614
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:56,009
Started stepping out with young men.
I caught her once and I...

615
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,249
Anyway, she died drunk.

616
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,185
Choked to death on her own vomit.

617
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,524
So I took Perry and we started roaming
to forget it all.

618
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,503
I took him with me everywhere.

619
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,942
How that boy loved me.

620
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,911
At night, when it was cold...

621
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,585
...we'd sleep cuddled up.

622
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,763
He'd hang onto me with his little arms,
so tight.

623
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,831
I'd tell him stories about
the great adventures we was gonna have.

624
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,380
How we was gonna strike it rich.

625
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,545
Buried treasures.

626
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,249
Gold.

627
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:12,024
In Alaska.

628
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:22,262
That's where this picture was took.
Him and me in Alaska.

629
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,811
You just ask Perry if I wasn't
a good father to him.

630
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,446
I always shared, always.
When I eat, he eats.

631
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:38,684
You just tell Perry,
when I die all my insurance goes to him.

632
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:45,923
Yes, sir.

633
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,594
His life is all set.

634
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,168
Great news!

635
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:58,601
I met this kid. He's a shoeshine boy.

636
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,911
He's got a cousin in Yucatan, a fisherman.

637
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,942
- And he's got a powerboat.
- So?

638
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:11,948
So, we drive to Yucatan, we sell the car...

639
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,018
...buy us a load of deepsea diving gear...

640
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:18,993
...and "pow," we hit the Cortés jackpot.

641
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:23,328
$60 million in Spanish gold.

642
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:29,667
Of course, we'll have to cut the kid in,
and his cousin, too.

643
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:36,444
But even so, Yucatan!

644
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,483
Hot, dry, clean...

645
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,978
...no crowd, no noise.

646
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,423
Doing what we came to do.

647
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:51,355
- How much can we get for the car?
- $120.

648
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,621
Is that all?

649
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:57,092
Enough to pay the bills.
Hotel, bar, groceries.

650
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:01,234
And with what's left over,
I bought us two bus tickets...

651
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:05,638
...as far as Barstow, California.
After that, we walk.

652
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,075
So get rid of that ton and a half of garbage.

653
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:12,444
Ship it! Dump it! Burn it! I don't care.

654
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:16,408
Only get rid of it, by tonight.
'Cause come tomorrow, we're gone.

655
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,921
- Back to the States.
- Now listen.

656
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,713
You listen! I've had it!

657
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:24,817
You, your maps, fishing boats,
buried treasure, all of it!

658
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,987
Everything! Stop jacking off.

659
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,998
There isn't any caskets of gold.
No buried treasure.

660
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,696
And even if there was, hell, boy,
you can't even swim.

661
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,668
You want to stick with me, okay.

662
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:43,644
You wanna split, that's okay, too.

663
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,914
Only make up your mind.

664
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,222
- I'll ship our stuff back to Vegas.
- Good.

665
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,618
I got a little <i>señorita</i> coming over tonight.

666
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,596
I'll try to be finished packing
before you get back.

667
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,525
What for? Hell, I'm not bashful, baby.

668
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:12,408
And that, if we find the motive,
we find the killer.

669
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,066
Lf.

670
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,346
This report was written six months...

671
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:22,077
...before the Clutters were killed.

672
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,118
It's called,
<i>Murder Without Apparent Motive</i>.

673
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,547
At the Menninger Clinic,
right here in Kansas...

674
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,151
...a study was made of four killers.

675
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,327
They all had certain things in common.

676
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:38,192
They all committed senseless murders.

677
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:43,171
They all felt physically inferior
and sexually inadequate.

678
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:48,309
Their childhood was violent,
or one parent was missing.

679
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,277
Or someone else had raised them.

680
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,585
They couldn't distinguish
between fantasy and reality.

681
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:01,054
They didn't hate their victims,
they didn't even know them.

682
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:05,083
They felt no guilt about their crime,
and got nothing out of it.

683
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:10,332
And most important,
they told the police or a psychiatrist...

684
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:16,369
...that they felt the urge to kill,
before they committed murder.

685
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,672
Their warnings were disregarded.

686
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:29,209
So, who killed the Clutters?

687
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:38,352
Someday, somebody will explain
to me the motive of a newspaper.

688
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,823
First you scream, "Find the bastards."

689
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:44,828
Till we find them you want to get us fired.

690
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:47,802
When we find them,
you accuse us of brutality.

691
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:52,765
Before we can go into court,
you give them a trial by newspaper.

692
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:56,772
When we finally get a conviction
you want to save them...

693
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,644
...by proving they were crazy
in the first place.

694
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:03,918
All of which adds up to one thing:
You've got the killers.

695
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,089
Off the record, have you got them?

696
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,388
Suspects.

697
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,060
Even if we catch them, that's all we've got.

698
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:20,459
Because without a confession, the evidence
we got so far, we couldn't go to trial.

699
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:25,368
Unless we can place the suspects
in this spot...

700
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:29,436
...unless we can tie the killers
to that piece of rope...

701
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:31,346
...they'll never hang.

702
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:02,867
<i>Perry!</i>

703
