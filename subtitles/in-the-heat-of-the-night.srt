309
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:10,511
so you could, uh...
complete the identification?

310
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:35,286
Martin, I want you to take Mrs. Colbert
over to the funeral parlor.

311
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,491
And, Wood,
run Virgil down the depot.

312
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:42,376
Uh... Virge here, Chief,
he thinks that Harvey's innocent.

313
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:47,627
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Could I talk to you about it, in private?

314
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,215
No. Because I got Colbert's wallet in my
hand, and we took it from Harvey Oberst.

315
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,471
- You think he gave it to him?
- I don't know.

316
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,759
But Oberst could have come along
after the crime, found it, picked it up.

317
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,225
- I don't know.
- That's what the boy said he did.

318
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,190
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I say different.

319
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,569
When I examined the deceased, it was
obvious the fatal blow was struck

320
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,358
from an angle of 17 degrees
from the right, which makes it

321
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,276
almost certain the person
who did it is right-handed.

322
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,946
- So what?
- (SHAGBAG) Harve's left-handed, Chief.

323
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,614
Everybody in town knows that.

324
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,750
We figured that out.
Harvey's a lefty. Uh-huh.

325
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,968
You're sure of yourself, Virgil. Funny
name for a nigger boy from Philadelphia.

326
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:37,552
- What do they call you up there?
- They call me Mr. Tibbs!

327
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:41,719
Mr. Tibbs! Well, Mr. Wood, take
Mr. Tibbs, take him down to the depot.

328
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,809
And I mean, boy, like now!

329
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,276
I'll have the FBI lab
send you the report on this.

330
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,741
Not that it'll make
any difference.

331
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,698
I'll take that.

332
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,456
No, you won't.

333
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,293
I'm sending it in personally.

337
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,272
My husband is dead.

338
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,945
Somebody in this town killed him!
I want you to find out who!

339
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,170
You gonna give me that?

340
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,265
No, I'm not.

341
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,387
Wood, you take him,

342
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,683
and you lock him up
for withholding evidence.

343
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,983
Go on, move! Put him with
his friend, Harvey Oberst!

344
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:29,080
Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains
to the hogs, that's for damn sure.

345
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:34,464
Hold on there, Arnold. Open her up again.
We got another customer.

346
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,668
(HARVEY)
Hey, man, not in here.

347
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:42,009
- Put him somewheres else!
- Don't push the panic button.

348
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,095
Play it cool, boy.
Play it cool.

349
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,226

I'm all you've got.

359
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,313
Police?

360
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,865
You're a cop?

361
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,611
- You're a cop.
- Mm-hm.

362
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,654
Yeah?

363
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,495
So, how come they locked you up?
How come they lock up a cop?

364
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,911
Who said they locked me up?

365
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,753
How come with all these empty cells here
they'd throw me in with you? You dig?

366
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,930
Look.

367
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,808
I already told 'em.

368
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,770
I see this fella lyin' on
the street there.

369
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,271
And there's this wallet
lyin' beside him.

370
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,063
Boy, I mean, I come into
this world outta luck.

371
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,860
Here's the first good thing
to come my way. And I pick it up.

372
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,288
But when I see whose
wallet it is...

373
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:36,746
I mean, I start to sweat. But I heard
about this new chief. This Gillepsie?

374
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,039
Got no more smile
than a turnip.

375
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:43,460
So I cut across the fields, headin' for the
line, and got myself as far as the bridge

376
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,799
before Gillespie grabbed me.

377
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,465
What time did you find the wallet?

378
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,268
Well, I ain't got no watch, but it must have
been after two, by the courthouse clock.

379
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,775
I'm interested in eleven to two.
Where were you?

380
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,688
Shootin' pool. Larry's Lounge.
I got there about ten.

381
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,778
- What time'd you leave?
- Closin'. Must have been one.

382
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,116
- Anybody can swear for you?
- Packy, Burt, Les.

383
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,997
Ever been in trouble
with the police before?

384
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,126
Come on.

385
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,541
I could ask at the desk,
you know.

386
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,842
Well, they brought
me in one time.

387
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:36,013
- On account of this Delores Purdy.
- On what charge?

388
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,943
Well, uh, this Delores,
she, uh...

389
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,362
she's real proud of what nature
done for her, you know?

390
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,826
And, uh...

391
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,491
Well, we was on a date
up to Clarke's Point, and, uh...

392
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,668
she says, uh...
<i>(SNIGGERS)</i>

393
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,089
Anyway, she asks me,
she says, uh...

394
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,547
"Don't you think I got
a classy build?"

395
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,882
And I say "Sure."

396
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,843
And so she starts to show me.

397
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,385
But I didn't do nothin' wrong.

398
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:19,101
I just didn't stop her from
tryin' to prove her point.

399
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,938
Then this cop, Sam Wood,

400
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,275
comes chargin' outta the bush
and hauls me in.

401
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,277
He let you go, didn't he?

402
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32,702
Told me not to mess with her no more.
She lives on Third, a block from me.

403
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,784
Traipsin' around in the altogether.
With the lights on.

404
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,041
Now, somebody sure oughta
make her stop doin' that.

405
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,920

413
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,432

415

It wouldn't be a bad idea to
change the charge against Oberst.

416
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:05,375
He was nowhere near the scene of the
crime, and I think he can prove it.

417

- About 12:30.

- Wait a minute. I'll get it.

Colbert wasn't killed
where the body was found.

422
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,477

- He was killed then moved to Main Street.

Mrs. Colbert, I told you
he was nobody's man.

00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,209
All right.

461
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,174
Now, Bill, how about
this here Negro officer?

462
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,839
Mrs. Colbert seems
to have confidence in him.

463
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,600
Oh, he ain't nothin'.
Some kind of a...

464
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,848
some kind of a homicide expert.
But I don't need him.

465
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,232
You mean you don't want him.
But you do need him.

466
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,450
Now look, Bill.
Suppose he turns up the killer.

467
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:50,956
He has no police power here. He's gonna
have to hand him over on a platter, right?

468
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,865
That's right.

469
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,626
And if he fails,
you're off the hook,

470
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,913
'cause it was Mrs. Colbert's idea
in the first place.

471
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,457
See what I mean?

472
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,718
Oh, yeah.

473
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:07,005
Works out all the way around, Bill.
For all of us.

474
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,308
Excuse me.

475
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,384
Any reason why you have
to leave today?

476
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,179
There's lots of reasons.

477
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:53,351
What would you say if
I asked you to stay for a while?

478
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,386
No.

479
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,868
This town needs a
factory, Virgil.

480
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,575
Colbert come down
from Chicago to build it.

481
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,913
I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.
Half of them'd be colored.

482
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:22,080
- Know what that means?
- Probably got him killed.

483
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:26,217
That's what Mrs. Colbert thinks.
She wants us to catch her a killer.

484
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,094
No killer, no factory.

485
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:33,508
Well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta
colored people. You follow me?

486
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,971
- I'm going home, man.
- They're your people.

487
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:41,482
Not mine... yours.
You made this scene.

488
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,316
- What do you want me to do? Beg you?
- Look, I've had your town up to here!

489
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:51,155
Boy, it would give me a world of
satisfaction to horsewhip you, Virgil!

490
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,742
My father used to say that.

491
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:07,132
- Even did, once or twice.
- Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.

492
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,928
Now you listen to me.

493
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,714
Just once in my life
I'm gonna hold my temper.

494
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,054
I'm tellin' you that
you're gonna stay.

495
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:20,722
You'll stay here if I have to have your
chief remind you what he told you to do.

496
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,982
But I don't think
I have to do that, you see?

497
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,691
No. Because you're so damned smart.
You're smarter than any white man.

You're just gonna stay here

unless you could put us all to shame.

You wanna know something, Virgil?

501
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:45,125
I don't think that you could let
an opportunity like that pass by.

Mrs. Colbert, can you tell me
about your husband's enemies?

533
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:13,371
That's Endicott.
He's been fighting us all the way.

534
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:17,587
He sits up on his hill
and runs this county.

535
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,423
Or did, until we moved in.

536
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:27,928
Did your husband tell you
where he was going last night?

537
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:33,975
He said he wasn't sleepy.
I went to bed.

538
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,981
What time was that?

539
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:40,235
A little after 11, I think.

540
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,864
Did he call you, or anybody
on your staff, after 11?

No.

can tell us what time he went out.

545
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,337
Find anything?

546
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,175

00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,350
Where you goin'?

548
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:37,645
I'd drive up there, but I'm sure you
don't want me running up there by myself.

549

01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,231
Endicott's folly.

- It's beautiful. It's breathtaking.

580
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,836
Have you a favorite,
Mr. Tibbs?

581
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:18,769
Well, I'm partial to
any of the epiphytics.

582
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,405
Why, isn't that remarkable!

583
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,994
That of all the orchids in this place,
you should prefer the epiphytics.

584
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,253
I wonder if you know why.

585
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,373
Maybe it would be helpful
if you'd tell me.

586
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:34,463
Because, like the Negro,

587
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:38,506
they need care and
feedin' and cultivatin'.

588
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,641
And that takes time.

589

That's somethin' you can't make
some people understand.

590
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,357
That's somethin'
Mr. Colbert didn't realize.

591
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,576
Is this what the
epiphytics root in?

592
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,408
My point! They thrive on it.

593
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,323
Take it away from them,
they do poorly.

594
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:09,746
- What do you call this material?
- That's osmunda. Fern root.

595
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,798
Well, we don't wanna take any
more of your time, Mr. Endicott.

596
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,807
Why'd you two come here?

597
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,025
To ask you about Mr. Colbert.

598
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,161
Let me understand this.

599

Well, your...

601

your attitudes, Mr. Endicott,

602
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,010
your points of view,
are a matter of record.

603
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:03,428
Some people... let us say the
people who work for Mr. Colbert...

604
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:08,221
might reasonably regard you as the person
least likely to mourn his passing.

to clarify some of the evidence.

608
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,999
Yeah?

609
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:34,038
- You saw it.
- Oh, I saw it.

610
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,711
What are you gonna do about it?

611
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,795
I don't know.

612
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,807
I'll remember that.

613
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:54,225
There was a time...
when I could have had you shot.

614
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:29,510
- You better clear out. And I mean fast!
- What about that speech you gave me?

615
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:32,304
I didn't know you'd slap any white man!
Least of all Endicott!

616
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,940
All right. Give me another day.
Two days. I'm close.

617
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:40,445
I can pull that fat cat down.
I can bring him right off this hill!

618
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,691
Oh, boy.

619
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,495
Man, you're just like
the rest of us.

620
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,077
Ain't ya?

621
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:10,050
It's all my fault.

622
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,181
But there's no point
in ducking it.

623
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,100
It's gonna be tough
to keep you in your job now.

624
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,528
Now look Bill. I don't have to tell you
how urgent it is to get Tibbs outta town.

625
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,864
- No. I already told him to go.
- All right.

626
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:32,076
Now, Mrs. Colbert is not
gonna be back till Thursday.

627
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,286
You catch your guilty
party by then,

628
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:38,044
she won't hold it against us we had
to send Tibbs home for his own good.

629
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,877
But you gotta do it, you hear?

630
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,133
I hear.

631
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,257
Bill?

632
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,141
What's made you change
your mind about Tibbs?

633
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,394
Who says I have?

634
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,514
Last chief we had,

635
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:03,062
he'd have shot Tibbs one second after he
slapped Endicott, claimed self-defense.

followed Tuesday night, same speed?

- Why?
- Why not?

670
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:30,282

- Well, I appreciate anything you can do.

Hm. I don't know.

- Yes. It's official, yes.

- Yeah. I'll put it in writing.

On police department letterhead?

I would write it on the head
of a pin if you want it there.

September.

747

Well.

- Yes.

01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,447
- Sam?
- That's right.

764
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,790
Our man is Endicott.

765
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:37,328
You just think a minute.
Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?

766
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:40,794
And yesterday he makes
a big cash deposit at the bank.

767
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,379
If I told you once,
I told you a hundred times

768
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:47,092
that I won that matchin' quarters
and halves. It took me three years!

769
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,302
Then why was it in big bills?
I checked.

770
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,436
Because whenever I got enough change,
I'd trade it in on $20 bills.

771
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:56,643
And when I got up to $600, I took
it down and put it in the bank.

772
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:01,811
The day Colbert was killed, he cashed
a check for $900, $600 of which is gone,

773
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:06,323
$300 of which I believe you left in the
wallet as bait for some kid like Oberst!

774
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:11,079
- What kinda man do you think I am?!
- Now, don't you push me, boy!

775
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,918
Now listen.

776
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,670
If you weren't
suspicious of Sam here,

777
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:25,005
why did you question him last
night when he changed his route?

778
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:30,130
- I knew why he changed his route.
- Knew what?

779
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:34,177
He was afraid I'd see some naked
white girl down the block.

780
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,687
- What?
- Some girl named Delores Purdy.

781
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:41,191
She parades around in the nude at
night to get her kicks. That's...

782
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:44,236
- How do you know?
- I know.

783
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,613
Well, I know. Do you understand?

784
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,867
I know that Colbert
cashed a check for $900.

785
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,619
I know that Sam made a
big cash deposit.

786
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,954
I know that you caught him in a lie.
And I know that's enough for me.

787
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,456
C'mon, Sam.

788
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,713
Martin, lock him up.

789
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,377
Well?

790
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:16,056
Well... you're making a mistake.

791
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:19,180
Don't you bet against it.

792
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,359
You can catch your
train now, Virgil.

Tibbs?

794
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,506
Do you think Sam did it?

795
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:00,805
- Where do I find the chief?
- What's it all about?

796
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:02,644
My business.

797
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:06,860
Hey, look, Purdy.

798
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:11,069
Now, you got a complaint?
Well, right here's where you file it.

799
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,202
What I got to say,
I say to the chief.

800
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,035
It's about Sam Wood.

801
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:21,700

Sam Wood's baby.

01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:21,052
- Boy, you don't want trouble, you get!
- You be sensible. I'm a police officer.

811
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:26,060
You gonna get him outta here,
or do I gotta do it?!

812
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:31,737

01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:03,678

- Yeah.

819
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,347

820
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,434
My brother works nights.

821
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,942
He leaves me all alone.

822
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:17,153
This particular night,
I go out on the porch.

823
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:22,079
I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be
if I had a fountain drink.

824
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:26,617
Sam comes down our road.

825
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,920

He's got a nice face,
don't you think, Chief?

829
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,138
So he stopped.

830
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,320
- <i>(SOFTLY)</i> He says...
- What? I didn't hear what you said.

you know what
the coolest spot in town is?"

834

And I said "No, Sam.
I guess I don't."

835
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:16,375
And he said...
"The cemetery. That's where."

836
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,757
"Know why?"

837
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:26,762
“Cause they got all of them

01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:30,807
"Ever stretch out
on a tombstone, Delores?"

01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:35,603
"Feel all that nice, cool marble
along your body?"

840
01:28:41,233 --> 01:28:44,533
- He said that?
- You hear, Chief? You hear?

841
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,788
Yeah, I hear.
I hear.

842
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:52,586
All right. Sam comes along and stops in
front of your house and talks. What else?

843
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,669
Well, come on now, girl.
What else? What else? What else?

844
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,962
- Then I went for a ride with him.
- Where'd you go?

845
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,174
The cemetery.

846
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:06,433
So, Wood took you to the cemetery
in the patrol car, right?

847
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:10,221
And then things went a bit too far.
Is that what you're sayin'?

848
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:12,606
Did they get a little
bit outta line?

849
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,608
Come on now.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?

850
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:17,769
Come on, girl!
Is it or ain't it?

851
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:20,655
- Yeah, they went too far!
- Well, fine!

852
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,235
Now, I got one more question.
Very important.

853
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:27,196
Did he force you,
or did you let him?

854
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,908
Don't mean a damn whether she
let him or not! She is still 16!

855
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:34,044
In this state, that's rape!
I know the plain law on that!

856
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:38,173
I know the laws in the state
of Mississippi, thank you!

857
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,213

- Courtney!
- Yes, sir?

859

Three people saw Colbert drive by...
alone... on the way back from Endicott's.

894
