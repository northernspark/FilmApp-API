3
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,951
Fuck!

4
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,879
Fuck!

<i>We don't have much time…</i>

<i>Tick tock, this man got rocked…</i>

8
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,945
I have an appointment.

9
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,915
My assistant was supposed to reschedule.

10
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:04,023
She didn't.

11
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:05,251
Better call her then.

12
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,750
Mom said you're not allowed
to reschedule with me.

13
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,249
Please, just this once.

14
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,757
Don't be a putz.

15
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,825
Putz?

16
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,196
I worked 80 hours this week.
What did you do?

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,774
Come on Dad, we don't have much time!

18
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,881
We have to build a wall
so the monster doesn't break through!

19
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,232
What ever happened to tea parties?

20
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,494
Don't little girls have
tea parties anymore?

21
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,492
You dig the moat.

22
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,401
Dig the moat before the monster comes.
It will slow him down.

23
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,837
Can't your mom dig the moat
when she gets up?

24
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,273
I'm not really prepared for any kind of…

25
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,171
moat digging.

26
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,583
Hurry up, we don't have much time!

27
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,380
Emma.

28
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,885
I just don't do this… okay?

29
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,223
Your mom can play these games with you,
okay?

30
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,903
I've never been any good at this anyhow.

31
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,296
You can do this Dad.

32
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,278
Oh no!

33
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:33,079
What?

34
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:37,345
It's coming! It's too late for the moat!
Get down Dad!

35
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,456
Ah! It's got me!

36
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,653
Ah! Save me Dad! Save me!

37
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,923
He's pulling me into his cave!

38
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:52,921
He's really ugly Dad!

39
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,464
It's got me. Come on save me.

40
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,951
Get away from her you big asshole!

41
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:14,387
Get 'em Dad! Get the bastard!

42
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,324
You mess with my daughter,
you mess with me!

43
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,230
Fort! Fort! Back to the fort!

44
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,266
Get down! Get down!

45
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,666
You did it Dad! You got 'em!

46
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,605
Hey…

47
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:35,699
When did you start saying… bastard?

48
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,241
<i>28,37, and 53.</i>

49
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:27,092
<i>So good luck to everybody out there
who played last night's lotto…</i>

50
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,578
Dad?

51
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,246
<i>I thought you were gone.</i>

52
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,681
<i>I went to your funeral.</i>

53
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,291
<i>No, no, no. I'm here…</i>

54
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,851
<i>I'll always be here for you.</i>

It's bedtime Princess Moomba.

57
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,505
It's time to get your beauty rest.

58
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,293
Your majesty has blessed the land
with your beauty today.

59
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,161
But it's quiet now and the journey
will continue tomorrow.

60
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,483
The rebels have infiltrated the base!

61
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,445
Bam! Boom!

62
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:07,606
Sir Lawrence, Sir Lawrence!

63
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:09,208
Send in the cavalry quick!

64
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,250
Sir Lawrence? Sir Lawrence⁈

65
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:12,511
What happened to you?

66
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,619
No!

67
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:14,415
Why⁈

68
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,450

69
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,057
Whhyyy⁈

70
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,388
He was so young!

71
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,731
Emma? You're not in there
playing are you?

72
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,318
That's a very convincing snore,
but you'll have to turn your light off,
young lady.

73
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,810
Thank you.

00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,665
She buys her friends.

78
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,348
She bought that body too.

79
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,365
Stop!

80
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,490
Stop talking about me!

81
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:50,837
Stop!

82
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,342
Stop it!

83
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,509
Stop it!

84
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,658
You idiot!

85
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,261
You idiot!

86
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:11,090
–How could you be so frivolous and stupid?
–Hello?

87
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,491
You're just like your father!

88
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,592
He was an idiot too.

89
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,928
You're disgusting!
You're disgusting to look at!

90
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,564
Even your own children are embarrassed
to be with you!

91
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,566
I made a mistake the minute I met you!

92
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,835
I should have known what a loser
you were gonna be!

93
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,069
Unemployed and penniless!

94
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,374
Someday I'll find a real man.

98

<i>You have a whole other life…</i>

99
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,360
<i>You can't change that now.</i>

100
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,131

Grandpa!

104
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,006
Grandpa!

No, the girl!

106
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,835
Go get the girl!

107
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,776
Help!

108
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,573
Well, it's one of the most
anticipated IPO's of the
year.

No, not this morning.
Please Roger, I hate that look.

I hate that pants-shitting terror look.

What is it man?
I'm not going to kill you.

119

–You know you are gonna survive the morning.
–We're in a serious crunch here John.

Word is that Apollo
is leaning toward Hamilton.

122
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,614
Hamilton came in last night
and they low-balled

123
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:51,850
the fee down to six and a half percent.
–Hey, hey, hey!

–What, what?
–Six and a half percent John.

125
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,754
They snaked us early.

126
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,988
Hamilton? On the Apollo…

127
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:58,523
–Are you talking about the Apollo account?
–Yes!

128
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:02,394
–Hamilton did six-and-a-half on Apollo?
–They came in and they low-balled us.

129
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,460
Where did you get this?

130
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,538
Carl's contact.

131
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,062
Yeah.

–Who the fuck let them do that?
–It's anyone's guess.

133
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,508

it was a little bit too far fetched, but then…

Hamilton couldn't find a
fat man in a county fair.

137

Fuck Hamilton, fuck em.

138

–They're gonna have to do better than that.
–John…

–Good luck!
–Sorry.

Listen Roger.

00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,359
One, two, three, branch…
One, two, three, branch!

166
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,233
Hello dirt. And how are we today?

167
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:58,563
Nope.

168
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,170
Don't have the face of a fighter do we?

169
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,599
You're Jacob?

170
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,939
My name's Allel.

171
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,305
I'm told I'm supposed to assist you.
You're able to help with the girl.

172
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,040
–Who was taken…
–Wait.

173
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,543
You're the one who got your ass kicked.

174
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,945
–What?
–Yeah I bet that doesn't sit too well with you.

175
00:25:20,985 --> 00:25:24,681
'Course a good ass kicking
doesn't sit well with anyone.

176
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:25,783
Are you mocking me?

177
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:27,883
Real sharp too aren't ya.

178
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,624
I get it! I get it! I'll play along!

179
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,359
You don't want word to get out do ya?

180
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,868
–What word?
–About your ass kicking!

181
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:40,365
Yeah no one knows you're actually a priss.
They're all fooled, but…

182
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,741
you really are a priss.

183
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,570
Is it your policy to let adorable little girls
disappear into the night?

184
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,568
–That's enough!
–Ohhh!

185
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,237
Cord has been struck…

186
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,288
Do we have a guilty child neglector here⁈

187
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,851
There it is!

188
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,279
The fighter!

189
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,790
Just had to be sure you know.

190
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,286
'Course she's roughing up the handicap,
but who's counting?

191
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:05,790
We meet again!

192
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,091
Look, is this a joke?

193
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:09,127
Do you actually have a purpose
or do you just talk trash?

194
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,361
You lost the girl right?

195
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,565
–No I didn't lose the girl!
–Sure, sure she was kidnapped.

196
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,607
There's still time…

197
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,075
before all is lost.

198
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,303
You have a way to track him?

199
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,039
Hell no and who wants to? Remember he
kicked your ass.

200
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,474
We'll go around the other side.
We'll find the physical girl.

201
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:27,110
–And do what?
–Shake the shit out of her!

202
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,782
Shake the shit out of her!

203
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,595
We'll wake her up.

204
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,363
That's just great!

205
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:43,478
Last time I checked there's no way to physically
affect them unless you're a…

206
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,637
you're a pathfinder.

207
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,034
Ow!

208
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,165
Help!

209
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,399
Help!

210
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,077
Help me!

211
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,203
Please!

212
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,706
I need help.

213
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,249
I have a delivery.

214
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,153
My key was broken.

215
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,748
Are you a failure Ink?

216
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,796
No.

217
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:01,332
Because failure is
not an option with us Ink.

218
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:04,563
Only perfection.

219
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,003
You can help me?

220
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,574
Yes I can. Would you like help Ink?

221
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,153
You need it.

222
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:25,486
With that shame…

223
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,689
That stench!

224
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,748
The code isn't here.

225
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,117
It's broken into two.

226
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,254
The carriers are drifters.

227
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,790
But they are loyal.

228
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:06,064
Find each of them and you'll have
access to the assembly.

229
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,932
Best keep your pacing.

230
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:10,168
You only have a few hours.

231
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,728
Fail now and you need not go on.

232
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:17,175
You only have one opportunity…

233
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,076
to become… numb.

234
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:30,569
No Phil. All things considered I think
I'd rather be rich, man.

235
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,039
Uh huh…

236
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,541
Uh huh…

237
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,388
Hey Phil… yeah… I gotta go.

238
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,265
Yeah, I gotta get to the pitch. Okay?

239
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,153
I'm sorry. He said it was an emergency.

240
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,767
What are you doing here?

241
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,912
I couldn't get you on the phone.

242
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,365
If I wanted to talk to you Ron,
I would have taken your call.

243
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,066
Emma's in the hospital.

244
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,379
They say that she's had some kind of seizure.

245
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,376
Is she okay?

246
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,549
She's alive…

247
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,810
but she's not been responsive.

248
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,446
She's in a coma now.

249
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,629
What are they doing for her?

250
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:21,259
Well they're trying
to keep her stable but they…

251
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,213
They said it's possible that…

252
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,530
this has weakened her heart.

253
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,198
They say it's… it's possible…

254
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,604
that she could just cycle
over into cardiac arrest.

255
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,671
Emma needs you.

256
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,630
Kathy and I are with her but…

257
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,617
but she does… she needs her father.

258
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,073
That's not my place anymore.

259
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,390
We have to let that go.

260
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,860
For your daughter.

261
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,595
What can I do now?

262
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,597
<i>He wanted to manipulate you.</i>

263
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,866
I'm asking you Ron, what can I do now?

264
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,067
I'm good enough to be her father now?

265
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,235
We have to let that go.

266
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,336
It's in the past now.

267
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,035
Is it?

268
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,806
Well it's very fucking present
for me Ron.

269
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,043
You know, you convince the world I'm
the antiChrist and you take her from me…

270
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,078
You can't throw that in the past Ron…

271
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,513
'cause that's where I live now!

272
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,015
–I know that you've suffered with this, we all have.
–Oh no… please.

273
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:22,253
–Look, I am pleading with you…
–I don't want to hear it… I don't want to hear it!

274
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,354
I don't even have a daughter… anymore…
remember?

275
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,495
Those words ring a bell?

276
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,405
John, I'm sorry—
Mr Hudson is asking for you.

277
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:36,999
I know Judith, I know.

278
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,383
You need to go.

279
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,621
This is not the time.

280
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,024
I didn't come here for that.

281
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,225
You want to talk about lives Ron?

282
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,127
Well I'm at the point of life and death…

283
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,213
on a multi-billion dollar deal.

284
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,398
And thousands of lives are at stake.

285
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,107
And that's important.

286
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,135
And that's my family now,
that's all I have left.

287
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,504
We did what we thought
was best for her but…

288
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,342
but she needs you now.

289
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,477
Consider your obligation as her father.

290
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,581
<i>This insignificant man.</i>

291
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,887
Obligation?

292
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,787
What's obligation to you?

293
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,454
You don't talk to Shelly for fifteen years…

294
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,398
and then you show up
at her fucking funeral!

295
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,793
Is that the obligation
you're talking about Ron, huh⁈

296
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:40,164
You know, taking care of Emma doesn't
somehow absolve you of all that shit!

297
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,099
<i>You could have killed him.</i>

298
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,467
You're still a fraud!

299
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,801
You live with that every day, don't ya?

300
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,369
–I'm trying to keep you
from making the same mistakes.

301
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,173
Oh fuck you Ron! I am not you!

302
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,109
Do you understand me⁈

303
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,809
Don't play the old wise man with me.

304
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,778
This is not about me and you John!

305
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,312
This is about your daughter.

306
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:56,217
Get out.

307
00:35:56,387 --> 00:36:00,941
–I'm asking you John.
–I will not wait for security to throw you out.

308
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,457
She's at Lutheran Hospital.

309
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,493
<i>They all grovel now.</i>

310
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,433
Thank you for your order sir,
confirmation's in the mail.

311
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:23,735
I just sold five million of our new
Bowman Pipeline junk bonds!

312
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,546
Hey, you work for me don't ya?
John Sullivan?

313
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,687
Scott Hamilton.

314
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,346
Yeah.

315
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,551
Heard you moved some big money down
in the pin. Five million is a big ticket.

316
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:37,119
Oh yeah… yeah… got lucky I guess,
I don't know.

317
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,726
Hey Todd.

318
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,027
Do you remember the Sable high-yield
account you threw back into the pot?

319
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,930
I just sold them three million
of Rumney Casino.

320
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,062
I hate you.

321
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:49,700
Johnny! Hey buddy… how are ya?

322
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,470
Word is that Scott Hamilton
has his eye on you.

323
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,806
Huh… you might be moving
into a corner office soon, huh⁈

324
00:36:55,846 --> 00:37:00,011
Unbelievable… you're here two-and-a-half years,
and you get a view of downtown.

325
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,889
You know what I got?
View of my own demise.

326
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,683
Hey! To the talk of the town…
John Sullivan!

327
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,315
To John!

328
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,699
This is ridiculous.

329
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,312
How many nights
are you going to do this?

330
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,372
Hey…

331
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,778
we had a great day today.

332
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:31,805
I mean… we… we just had to celebrate.

333
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,346
You know.

334
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,584
Look at me.

335
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,180
What?

336
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,491
This has got to stop.

337
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:49,159
You can't be absent all the time.

338
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,062
<i>She hated your success.</i>

339
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,132
You have a whole other life…

340
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,503
that you are forgetting.

341
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,506
<i>You can't change that now.</i>

342
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,047
<i>You were so ashamed.</i>

343
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:48,726
Mr Sullivan, your family has already suffered
an immense amount of grief.

344
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,663
So it saddens me to have
to create any more.

345
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:56,327
However I feel with your history of drug abuse
and your negligent behavior regarding your daughter…

346
00:38:56,367 --> 00:39:00,631
it's important that you be given
some time to re-examine your life.

347
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,134
I see you are currently unfit
to care for your daughter.

348
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:07,037
–Therefore it is the order of the court…
<i>–They stole her.</i>

349
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:09,340
–The custody of Emma Sullivan…
–Please! Please Stop!

350
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,209
–Be awarded to Ronald and Katherine Evans.
–Stop!

351
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,417
Damn it!

352
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,975
Oh! Let me help you.

353
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,380
No don't touch <i>a…!</i>

354
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,786
Don't touch a thing… please.

355
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,721
Asshole.

356
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:28,125
Two… three… four… one… two… three… four…

357
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,723
step… two… three… four

358
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,204
So uh… I'm a little confused
about the plan here.

359
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,172
Yeah, you and me both.

360
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:41,372
As far as I know, we're supposed to try to recover
from the other side, physically wake her
and pull her back.

361
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,812
And we do that how?

362
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,643
I don't know.
Today we're just escorts for him.

363
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,549
He's a Pathfinder.

364
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,183
You're a Pathfinder?

365
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:57,455
Yeah, I wouldn't try to have a real rational
conversation with him Sara, or even a pleasant
one.

366
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,725
Oh, and he has wandering hands.

367
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,194
Ouch… two… three… four.

368
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,233
Alright.

369
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,138
We do this carefully and quietly.

370
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,541
We pack light so… uh… don't fight. Mmmk?

371
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,237
Okay, he just needs
to observe right now.

372
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,572
He studies the scene
and we watch his back.

373
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:21,420
Now we have no idea if this girl is being guarded
so it's imperative that we keep quiet.

374
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,682
We get seen, we have more heat
than we can handle.

375
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,686
What do you see?

376
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,927
It's her… Emma… the girl's body, she's
unconscious on the bed.

377
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,332
What else?

378
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,732
Her Grandmother's in the room.

379
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:16,894
She's doing what?

380
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,008
Standing.

381
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,944
And she's looking at?

382
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,891
She's looking out the window.

383
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,542
Keep describing.

384
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:32,920
Her Grandmother's looking at Emma now.

385
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,821
She's touching her forehead.

386
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,369
Doesn't sound right.

387
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,180
Where are this girl's parents?

388
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,063
You'll wear her guts!

389
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,971
You'd murder her,
rather than hand her over?

390
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,667
Is she that expendable to you Ink?

391
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,344
That's it!

392
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:41,572
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

393
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,804
Let's talk about this.

394
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,475
Leave her.

395
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,177
Take me.

396
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,654
She's done.

397
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,662
Okay, I yield.

398
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,170
Morning.

399
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:41,899
Someone want to fill me in?

400
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,768
Our inside man says Hamilton put in
an after-hours wine and dine.

401
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,737
Says they offered up six-and-a-half at
seventeen.

402
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,341
Our inside man, have mercy.
We've turned into the CIA.

403
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,014
Fuck! Fuck!

404
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,960
It's okay, okay.

405
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,293
Hamilton's a joke.
They're on their last legs.

406
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:07,724
We can beat this.

407
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,159
John, how the hell are we
going to beat this?

408
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,162
We all know they're going to bring
the offer to market using
the usual syndicate…

409
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,965
and now they're making sure Apollo knows it.
–That's been the problem all along…

410
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,100
we simply cannot compete
with their trifecta.

411
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,470
For the love of fuck people! Why
do we want to forfeit before the game?

412
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,507
Huh? Let's pick up the bat,
and take a few swings.

413
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,910
Look, letting this one slide
is just not an option.
It's not on the table.

414
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,454
Okay? We are there, we will take it.

415
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,249
We can always work the numbers.

416
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,645
We could substantiate an offer at…
eighteen? Be a little creative.

417
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,789
I love this woman. I love this woman.

418
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,195
That's what I'm talking
about. A little creativity.

419
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,760
It's bullshit.

420
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,570
<i>This was nothing to you.</i>

421
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,079
<i>This has got to stop.</i>

422
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,421
<i>You can't be absent all the time.</i>

423
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,013
It's about self-image guys.

424
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,985
It's just about how
they perceive themselves.

425
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,335
Apollo is high as a kite right now.

426
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,522
So we indulge that.

427
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,730
They want numbers, we'll give them some
numbers.

428
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,162
How solid is this?

429
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,524
Solid.

430
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:19,763
Okay.

431
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,446
So we meet Hamilton's six-and-a-half.

432
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:28,004
We offer up a firm commitment. Eighteen
dollars, fifty cents.

433
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:29,573
No one's gonna fuck with that.

434
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,174
John that's a pretty big stretch.

435
00:47:31,214 --> 00:47:32,011
Dan!

436
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,614
I will sell this. I will sell this.

437
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,849
I just affirm what they already believe.

438
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:43,509
These guys think they're God.
Let's give them some numbers that agree.

439
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,421
<i>They worship you.</i>

440
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:03,970
Hey John!

441
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,476
How many generations of trash
do you come from?

442
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,123
Don't listen to them John.

443
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,750
Don't listen to them John!

444
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,324
You are better than that!

445
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,148
You are better than that!

446
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:28,962
It'll be $10.80

447
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,100
I'm um… paying with food stamps today.

448
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,975
<i>Humiliation.</i>

449
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,647
<i>What are they're staring at?</i>

450
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,021
<i>They'll all burn John.</i>

451
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,133
In case we need the big guns.

452
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,807
If all goes peachy, we will.

453
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,483
Quiet. Get back.

454
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,060
Damn it!

455
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,928
Oh! Let me help you.

456
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,823
No don't touch!
Don't touch a thing, please!

457
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,593
He's ahead of us.

458
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:36,695
He's walking to his car and there's
an Incubus shadowing him.

459
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,669
What does the Incubus look like?

460
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:42,167
Large. Collected.

461
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:49,785
One… two… three… four…

462
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,154
What is an Incubus doing with him
during the day?

463
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,885
What does it mean?

464
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,694
It means this guy is fucked.

465
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:07,804
Two… three… four… one… two… three… four…

466
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:13,765
One… two… three… four.

467
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,970
Are you good?

468
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,740
Yes.

469
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,437
And he's bad?

470
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,239
He's not good.

471
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:54,950
What do you think? Does he seem
bad to you Emma?

472
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,149
You know my name?

473
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,512
I know a lot about you.

474
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,281
How?

475
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,620
When you go to sleep at night,
do you like having dreams?

476
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,999
Well, when you sleep,
people like me come.

477
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:13,629
And we give you, and your family,
and everyone you know good dreams.

478
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,070
Does he give nightmares?

479
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:20,837
Not yet he doesn't.

480
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,209
Quiet!

481
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,450
Can you take me home?

482
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,956
No, I can't. Why do you want to go home?

483
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,451
I'm scared.

484
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,354
That's strange.

485
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,268
I didn't think a lioness could get scared.

486
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,194
–What?
–A lioness.

487
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,329
Don't tell me you don't know.

488
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,667
Know what?

489
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,298
Ink didn't tell you?

490
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,471
You know you're not
a little girl anymore, right?

491
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,848
In this world,
you become something else.

492
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:02,148
And as soon as you came here
you started to turn into a lion.

493
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,687
A lion?

494
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,882
Well you still look like
a little girl but…

495
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,485
you started turning into a lion
as soon as you woke up here.

496
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:09,651
I did?

497
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,454
Yeah, see that's why I'm so surprised.

498
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:15,830
'Cause usually lionesses
are big, brave suckers.

499
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,099
I'm sure you can tell.

500
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,231
You're full of it.

501
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:21,996
Am I?

502
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,942
Just what I thought.

503
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:28,204
You know you might start working
on your roar though.

504
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:31,742
It's tough to be a noble lioness
without a good roar.

505
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,185
Storytellers! Liars!

506
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,915
I'll be rid of you soon.

507
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:41,012
Intruders!

508
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,850
Stay back… stay back!

509
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:50,658
This is mine! This is all mine!

510
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,290
Roar!

511
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,046
This… this is all mine! It's all mine!

512
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,014
–Th… th… that's mine!
–Aaagh!

513
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:16,212
I'm here for a code.
I have a delivery for the Assembly.

514
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,581
There are… there are… there are codes.

515
00:54:18,621 --> 00:54:26,363
They are codes that belong to me and they will
not be taken unless they are replaced by
something of greater value.

516
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,921
You want payment?

517
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,194
Payment will be your life!

518
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,693
No my life… my life… no, no! No!

519
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:38,808
For my things to be taken,
must replaced and doubled.

520
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:39,776
My life?

521
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:44,679
Mmm… nah. No, that's… thats,
that's not of adequate value.

522
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,331
–Ooooh… those are mine.
–Two!

523
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:04,232
Yeah… three of those are mine.

524
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:10,136
So. Assembly codes?

525
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,398
This way.

526
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:19,616
So… you've uh… come here for codes have
you? Well!

527
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,777
I have codes!

528
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,480
Some… some… uh… somewhere… um…

529
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,752
Assembly codes!

530
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,094
Umm… somewhere… uhhh…

531
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:41,097
Assembly codes.

532
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:05,116
How did you get the big prize?

533
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,061
Oh, she… she… she's worth quite a lot I hear.

534
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,033
I can take her off your hands for you.

535
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,574
Liev… the Storyteller.

536
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,211
Liev.

537
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,745
The Storyteller.

538
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,148
Get down now!

539
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:42,866
I have a $10,000 PowerPoint here.
All the bells and whistles.

540
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:47,783
Showing you why we are the greatest,
the most reliable. Yadaa Yadda Yadda.

541
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,531
But this meeting isn't about us.

542
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,201
This meeting is about you.

543
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:58,841
It's about how you guys are going to be the
biggest company in the world in mobile delivery
systems.

544
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:09,152
I've given them an hour. They agreed to
eighteen fifty and everything we set forth.

545
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:13,556
As long as I show up with the final paperwork
and a bottle of Champagne.

546
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,063
We're in business.

547
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,432
<i>One hour… you've got to be there.</i>

548
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,706
Wake up!
<i>Your whole life is gonna crumble.</i>

549
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:26,776
Wake up!

550
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:28,903
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

551
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:32,070
<i>Tick tock. This man got rocked.</i>

552
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,526
Two… <i>three…</i>
four… one… two… three… four.

553
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:56,462
One… two… three… four…

554
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,201
What exactly are you doing?

555
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,573
I need links.

556
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:00,801
Links.

557
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,571
A chain needs links.

558
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,981
Chain… chain reaction?

559
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:07,577
You've got it, tell her what she's won Bob!

560
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,980
You know what, I don't get this! I don't get you!
I don't get this mission!

561
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,284
What are we even doing here,
we're wasting our time!

562
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,686
A child is going to die and you're burning her
time!

563
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,321
Death is the least of her troubles.

564
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:23,322
That's right! You know what, you're right! So
let's help her.

565
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:27,163
You know the downward spiral is essentially a
chain reaction?

566
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,465
And nothing that comes out of your mouth
makes any sense!

567
00:58:29,505 --> 00:58:31,633
They're all reactions!

568
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:38,114
One thing begets the next. A man has a
weakness, he's flawed.

569
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:41,377
That flaw leads him to guilt. The guilt leads him
to shame.

570
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,921
The shame he compensates with pride and
vanity.

571
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:48,417
And when pride fails, despair takes over and
they all lead to his destruction.

572
00:58:48,457 --> 00:58:51,018
What will become his fate.

573
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:55,661
Something's got to stop the flow.

574
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,039
He's on his way.

575
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:15,184
The girl needs her father…

576
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:18,153
and we're going to deliver him.

577
00:59:20,723 --> 01:00:48,444
One… two… three… four…

578
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:50,241
One…

579
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,698
Something's got to stop the flow.

580
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:36,009
One hour, you've got to be there.

581
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:42,223
Wake up! Your whole life is gonna crumble!

582
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,654
Wake up!

583
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,034
He's running for help! We don't have much time.

584
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:02,374
Tick tock. This man got rocked.

585
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,095
<i>It's okay…</i>

586
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:33,274
<i>it's all going to be okay John.</i>

587
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,139
Doesn't sound too good.

588
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,703
Yeah, usually I can get it to start.

589
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,713
Unfortunately I'm not to good with cars, but…

590
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,040
this is the engine, right?

591
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,548
Okay, alright.

592
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,581
–Oh, look at this. Yeah, right here.
–What?

593
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:55,184
–This is your problem right here.
–Oh thank goodness.

594
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,158
Ah, check this out.

595
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,021
Yeah, try starting her up.

596
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,104
Sorry… that was bad. Sorry, that was bad.

597
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,041
–No… it was good.
–No, no. That was bad.

598
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,680
<i>You were so cute.</i>

599
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,841
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

600
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,410
<i>Why?</i>

601
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:25,018
<i>I don't know… I guess I
was humbled by you.</i>

602
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,650
–No! No!
–Shelly! Come back! Shelly!

603
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,292
–No!
–I love you Shelly!

604
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:32,388
–Shelly! I love you I want the kisses!
–Get away from me you freak!

605
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,286
–Kisses!
–No!

606
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,258
–I love you Shelly!
–No! No!

607
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:38,261
–I want the kisses! I want the kisses!
–No! No! No!

608
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,064
Oh baby! Oh baby!

609
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:45,797
I know…

610
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:52,245
I know I don't… uhh… say…

611
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,574
I just want you to know…

612
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:56,879
I just… I want you… I want you…

613
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:58,751
–John.
–Yeah.

614
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,482
I love you too.

615
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,058
<i>This is who you were.</i>

616
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,431
Why are you here⁈

617
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:13,362
What do you mean?

618
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,998
I know who you are Storyteller.
This is a trap!

619
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:19,001
You set me up! I'll kill
her! I'll kill us all right
here!

620
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:23,205
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I'm the one in chains here,
remember Sparky, I'm the one who's unarmed.

621
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:24,371
Liar!

622
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:31,414
–You're confused by your own paranoia.
–Who is this girl? Why do you care about this
child?

623
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,615
You are in complete control.

624
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,770
What is it you're so afraid of?

625
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,836
Why the scars Ink?

626
01:06:56,445 --> 01:07:02,253
Do you even remember how you got them or did
you lose your memory when you came through?

627
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,885
It was suicide wasn't it?

628
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:10,523
I can tell from your scars
your entry was painful.

629
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,361
Remember.

630
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,363
You can see nothing.

631
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,760
They'll be gone soon.

632
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,233
At the assembly…

633
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,798
When you become one of them?

634
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:32,161
You've been given promises of beauty
and bliss in exchange for your soul.

635
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,715
This girl…

636
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,090
she's your ticket?

637
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:46,722
They told you bring her to the table
and you become one of them?

638
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,697
Numb to your pain.

639
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,438
They told you to take her as a sacrifice?

640
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,394
That's all she is.

641
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:59,471
There's nothing in you that sees
something else?

642
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:02,466
I have no sympathy for their kind.

643
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:06,409
Don't try to manipulate my emotions,
I don't have any.

644
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:11,447
I'm not interested in manipulation, just in
revealing the truth. But you can't accept it.

645
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:12,815
I accept what's real!

646
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,901
You can't even accept yourself!

647
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,869
Why do you hide under that cloak?

648
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,651
You wreak of guilt.

649
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,792
Guilt comes from someone with a soul.

650
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:23,890
Words.

651
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,058
A Storyteller.

652
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,069
Where is your army?

653
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,997
I have no army Ink.

654
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,973
I'm alone.

655
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,350
No one is coming for me,
there's no trap.

656
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,527
You are in control.

657
01:08:56,365 --> 01:09:00,802
Yours, hers, my fate, are in your hands.

658
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,801
You will not stop me.

659
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,077
This girl will go to the assembly.

660
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,296
Hello!

661
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,436
You've come to visit Sadie?

662
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:12,474
Sadie loves visitors.

663
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,306
And they love to visit me.

664
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,104
They love to take my picture.

665
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,648
Love to see me smile.

666
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:24,613
They ask about me all the time.

667
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:28,245
What is she doing? Who is she with?

668
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,524
Where have they all gone?

669
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:44,470
But here you are… my… audience.

670
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,915
My name is… Ink.

671
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:54,849
Who is this⁈

672
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,155
Her ugliness disgusts me!

673
01:11:00,188 --> 01:11:01,690
I am Ink.

674
01:11:01,723 --> 01:11:03,525
These are my prisoners.

675
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:05,868
I have a delivery for the Assembly.

676
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:08,492
I need part of a code.

677
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,724
I will speak with you.

678
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,364
But not in her presence.

679
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,378
Ooohhh… a kiddie!

680
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:23,902
Roar!

681
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,612
It's gettin' there.

682
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:40,939
Guess we're not well liked here.

683
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,290
Who's she?

684
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,859
She's a drifter.

685
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,036
She was once a person.

686
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,181
And when she died she came here.

687
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,900
But she wanders around
not knowing her place.

688
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:56,173
She's not a Storyteller like me.
Or an Incubus.

689
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:00,275
She refuses both sides. Like Ink.

690
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,685
How long have you been a Storyteller?

691
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,521
How long?

692
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:10,684
Well, that depends on
how you measure time.

693
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:15,858
For us, time doesn't work the same
as it does for you.

694
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,355
We live in two different timelines.

695
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,540
She's cutting your hair.

696
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:33,452
She wants your hair
for part of the code.

697
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:35,641
You'll give it to her.

698
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:37,908
It's yours.

699
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,096
Filthy! Probably worthless!

700
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:50,859
Of course I won't tell
anybody I took it from some
cheap bag!

701
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:54,130
Of course, in the right light…

702
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:59,265
in the right light,
no one notices anything.

703
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:04,008
When they light me,
it's as though I were silk.

704
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,213
Shimmering almost!

705
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:10,012
Reflecting every gaze.

706
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,654
That's enough.

707
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,345
There's a bigger picture.

708
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,441
What?

709
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:48,784
Liev says we can't see, but…

710
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,508
there's a bigger picture.

711
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,112
Should we send for help yet?

712
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,766
Not yet…

713
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,073
she needs more time.

714
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,867
How are you able to do what you do?

715
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,277
It's all about the beat.

716
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:30,293
God may have taken my sight.

717
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,130
But I can hear the beat.

718
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:34,903
The beat?

719
01:14:34,936 --> 01:14:36,495
Beat of the world.

720
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:40,007
We're all part of a song,
I just hear the music.

721
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:43,873
You can physically change
the path of people's lives?

722
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,903
That's what they say.

723
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,734
You think he'll be okay?

724
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,785
Sure. A little physical damage
can be good.

725
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,987
Shake the shit out of 'em.

726
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,656
That's what I always say.

727
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,991
He's convinced himself he's God.

728
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,577
We're just reminding him he's not.

729
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,077
Takes humility to remember who we are.

730
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,230
If he embraces his shame…

731
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:18,877
she has a chance.
If not, the girl will be lost.

732
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:22,148
That can't happen.

733
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,511
Better get movin' big boy…

734
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,880
she doesn't have much time.

735
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:38,365
Shelly… baby… baby… stay awake… baby…

736
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:43,237
Shelly… Shelly… Shelly…

737
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:46,836
Stay… stay with me… stay with me…
stay with me.

738
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:50,078
Stay awake… stay awake… just stay awake…

739
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:51,073
–Sir come with me.
–Wait!

740
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,074
–Sir we need to get your leg checked out.
–Wait! Wait! Wait!

741
01:15:53,114 --> 01:15:54,650
–Come on sir.
–Wait!

742
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:55,877
Come on, she's going to be okay.

743
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:57,452
Sir come with me.

744
01:15:57,485 --> 01:15:58,513
She's going to be okay.

745
01:15:58,553 --> 01:16:00,081
–Let's get your leg checked out.
–She's going to be okay.

746
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:01,612
Let's go over here.

747
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,940
<i>That's when I lost you.</i>

748
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,110
<i>That's when I lost you.</i>

749
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,911
<i>But it wasn't your fault.</i>

750
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,927
I didn't know what to do.

751
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,922
I didn't know what to do.

752
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,168
I know.

753
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,803
I know.

754
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:57,156
I came home, and you were gone.

755
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,977
But your things were there like you…
like you were just coming back.

756
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,485
I didn't… I didn't know what to do.

757
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:10,573
'Cause I couldn't for the life of me
wrap my mind around the fact that…

758
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:19,027
you were never coming back.

759
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,433
It's okay.

760
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:25,464
This wasn't your fault.

761
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,033
I miss you so much.

762
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,209
I miss you so much.

763
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:35,706
I miss you too.

764
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,616
Why don't you fight?

765
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:17,919
You're letting this happen.

766
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,261
You're a warrior.

767
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,429
You should fight.

768
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,026
Fighting would only blind you further.

769
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:41,942
Do you like my hair?

770
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,115
It's all the rage right now.

771
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,735
Makes no sense.

772
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,319
What do you care about her?

773
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,815
There's billions of children out there.

774
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,470
Her life means nothing.

775
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,325
I believe it means something to her.

776
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:23,357
Yet you push forward.

777
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,317
I have nothing to lose.

778
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,233
I'm damned regardless.

779
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:35,334
You've convinced yourself of that.

780
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,299
You're desperate now.

781
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,304
I know my fate is determined.

782
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,146
I don't believe the rumors about you.

783
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:48,709
What are you doing with her?

784
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:55,972
She's an extra… gift…
for the acceptance.

785
01:20:56,818 --> 01:21:01,983
Dangerous, but he will be happy.

786
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:37,889
<i>–Get her Dad!
–Feet! Feet! Feet!</i>

787
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,422
<i>Go! Go!</i>

788
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,511
<i>This is who you were.</i>

789
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,427
How do you feel?

790
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:17,730
Lost.

791
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,963
You were in a car accident.
You have a nice little concussion.

792
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:26,201
Just go ahead and relax and the Doctor
will be with you in a moment. Okay?

793
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,208
Where am I?

794
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,767
You're at Lutheran Hospital.

795
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:31,874
<i>Lutheran Hospital.</i>

796
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:48,719
There's not much time.

797
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:51,095
Come on John.

798
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:49,616
Come on John!

799
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:24,419
Shit! We need help
I'm launching the pop!

800
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,483
Do it!

801
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:39,841
What's going on?

802
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:42,742
The remote… it's… it's not working.

803
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,270
Damn it!

804
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:49,154
It has to be launched
from the base then.

805
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:58,920
Go Allel! We'll hold them off
as long as we can.

806
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,808
He won't make it without me!

807
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:02,355
I'll go.

808
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,667
Wow!

809
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:12,438
Crazy blind bastard on the loose!

810
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,441
One, two, three, four…

811
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:19,207
I'll stay with him.
Buy me as much time as you can.

812
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:20,963
It's not going to be much!

813
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:26,939
One, two, three, four…

814
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,216
One, two, three, four…

815
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:29,708
One, two, three, four…

816
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:03,124
Uh, hey, hey, excuse me…

817
01:26:03,157 --> 01:26:05,193
If I wanted to find a patient…

818
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:06,053
a little girl?

819
01:26:06,093 --> 01:26:09,690
Little girl? All children
are in pediatrics which is
one floor up and to the left.

820
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:11,358
–Okay?
–Okay. Yeah.

821
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,616
One, two, three, four…

822
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,438
One, two, three, four… one…

823
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,914
three, four, one, two, three, four…

824
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,603
Emma…

825
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:33,372
Emma, look at me.

826
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:38,001
Oh my…

827
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:40,037
What?

828
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:42,941
I think the change is complete.

829
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,352
I see a lioness.

830
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:48,850
At first I wasn't sure,
but then suddenly…

831
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,983
I noticed something.

832
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:53,487
Look how brave you've become.

833
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:56,061
The little girl I met is no more.

834
01:28:56,631 --> 01:29:00,192
She's now the most ferocious creature
on Earth.

835
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:02,329
I knew I was right.

836
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:08,498
When I die will I be
a Storyteller like you?

837
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:15,507
No, you'll be far greater than that.

838
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,784
You'll be much more beautiful.

839
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,917
Will I get to see my Mom again?

840
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,656
Yes you will Sweetie.

841
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:43,402
The real prize today… is Ink.

842
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:47,606
You have proved your loyalty.

843
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:53,243
Those scars, they will be gone now.

844
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:56,717
No more shame.

845
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:59,387
Because pride…

846
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:02,481
is what we are made of.

847
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:08,451
You will be our greatest asset.

848
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,335
Roar!

849
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:42,727
Ink…

850
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:47,031
Incredible Ink.

851
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,936
You hide yourself ashamed…

852
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:57,376
but you can't see how beautiful you are.

853
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,880
I don't understand.

854
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:04,876
Why are you here?

855
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:08,880
What have you done?

856
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:12,354
I'm here for you Ink.

857
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,092
I'm here for you.

858
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,264
Why?

859
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:23,333
Why?

860
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:26,264
What do you want from me?

861
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,240
I am ruined.

862
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:35,240
Why can't you see that?

863
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:39,743
Because I choose to see you…

864
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:43,080
for what you were intended to be…

865
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:46,451
not for what you've become.

866
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:52,895
When will you recognize her?

867
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,669
Has your mind become so corrupted?

868
01:32:56,871 --> 01:32:58,395
Who?

869
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,408
This is what you could become.

870
01:33:03,277 --> 01:33:06,246
This is what you will choose to be.

871
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:09,610
You don't have to choose this.

872
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:32,903
I don't understand.

873
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:35,572
I don't understand.

874
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:37,608
You know my name…

875
01:33:38,412 --> 01:33:39,970
but why?

876
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:44,278
Because you're a great warrior.

877
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:50,014
Because it's said…

878
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,225
you can undo what's already been done.

879
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:08,139
<i>When will you recognize her?</i>

880
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:11,502
<i>Has your mind become
so corrupted?</i>

881
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,708
<i>This is what you could become.</i>

882
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:54,124
<i>This is what
you will choose to be.</i>

883
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:57,651
<i>You don't have to choose this.</i>

884
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:19,239
<i>It was suicide wasn't it?</i>

885
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:28,948
<i>I can tell from your scars
your entry was painful.</i>

886
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:38,726
<i>For us time doesn't work the same
as it does for you.</i>

887
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:42,635
<i>For me, a day is
like a thousand years…</i>

888
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:46,336
<i>and a thousand years
is like a day.</i>

889
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:06,890
You see now John?

890
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:09,854
You see now?

891
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:22,994
He did it.

892
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:28,234
One… two… breathe… four… one… two…
don't die!

893
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:56,819
Forgive me.

894
01:40:17,778 --> 01:40:18,870
Dad?

895
01:40:23,717 --> 01:40:25,309
Yes baby.

896
01:40:28,155 --> 01:40:30,487
What happened to you?

897
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:14,325
Dad…

898
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:16,527
Dad?

899
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:19,831
Emma.

900
01:41:20,874 --> 01:41:22,899
Is that you?

901
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:27,337
Yeah baby… it's me… it's me.

902
01:41:28,148 --> 01:41:30,514
I'm not dreaming?

903
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:34,110
No… you're not…
you're not dreaming.

903
