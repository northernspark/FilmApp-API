00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:02,050
MAN:
We got vultures circling here.

5
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:05,186
Lacs to the neck, chest, hands,
shoulder-- take your pick.

6
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:06,904
How many times
was she stabbed?

7
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:08,440
She's lost
too much blood.

8
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,241
Jed! Need a large bore IV, stat!

9
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:11,943
Neighbours watched it happen,
and no one even called the cops.

10
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:13,812
We did what we could, but--

11
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:14,912
Does she have a name?

12
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,080
Allison Parks.

13
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:17,449
Okay, Allison, stay with us.

14
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,124
Gonna have to jump her.
Gimme 360.

15
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,059
Charge 360.

16
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:34,649
Oh, my god.

17
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:41,389
He loved me.

18
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,574
Wait a minute.
She's trying to say something.

19
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:46,261
Clear!

20
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,346
Kaitlyn! Kaitlyn!

21
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,120
You all right?

22
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,725
He loved me.

23
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,629
Where is she?!

24
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,233
Oh, thank God.
What
happened?

25
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:11,736
Shit, Kate, your heart just
stopped... that's all.

26
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:14,923
Hey, hey, hey!
Take it easy.

27
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:20,862
You've taken
some punishment today.

28
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,934
What the hell happened in there?

29
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:28,269
What do you mean?

30
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,306
Well, grabbing a patient in the
middle of an ICD?

31
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:32,307
You have a death wish?

32
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:35,159
No, she was lucid.
She was awake.

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,828
Who?

34
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:40,365
The girl. That girl.
Did she make it?

35
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,600
Let's just worry
about you, okay?

36
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,119
She was responsive.

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,187
She was scared to death,
but she was responsive.

38
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:47,838
What are you talking about,
sweetie?

39
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,074
She looked right at me.

40
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,676
She spoke to me. She was trying
to talk to me.

41
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:55,746
She was trying to...
tell me something.

42
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:57,448
That girl had been stabbed over
a dozen times.

43
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,550
You have any idea
how much blood she lost?

44
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,252
She couldn't have said a word.

45
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:03,955
No... No, she--
she spoke to me.

46
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:05,974
She was trying to tell me--

47
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:09,811
I think she was trying to tell
me who stabbed her.

48
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:12,913
Honey, that girl was dead

49
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:15,049
before she ever came
through those doors.

50
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,715
So, let me guess...
no witnesses, right?

51
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:50,001
14 witnesses
watched her go down.

52
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:54,071
Watched it? What do you mean,
"Watched it?"

53
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:55,507
Did you get statements?

54
00:03:55,508 --> 00:03:57,024
Heard a scuffle, they looked out
the window,

55
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,776
and they watched a little girl
get stabbed

56
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:00,345
like they was watching
television.

57
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:01,930
Here's the best part:
no one bothered to call 911.

58
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,534
Well, that is just wonderful.

59
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:17,128
Do me a favour, will you?

60
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,429
Grab some shots
from the windows,

61
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,931
looking down on this area.

62
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,899
Sure thing.

63
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:34,778
So why would no one call the
cops, huh? Tell me that.

64
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:38,082
Listen, man, I find that fact a
bit depressing,

65
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:41,586
but... not us.

66
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:44,889
14 people means 14 witnesses.
Somebody saw something.

67
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,008
Best I could get was
a vague description.

68
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,762
Male. Race unknown.
Black jacket.

69
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:52,496
Maybe a blue baseball cap.

70
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:56,300
And not one person caught a
glimpse of the perp's face?

71
00:04:56,301 --> 00:05:00,605
It's too dark out here.

72
00:05:00,606 --> 00:05:02,807
How long's this lamp been out?

73
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:05,676
I don't know.
It's a good question.

74
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,331
Well, do me a favour,
will you?

75
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:13,534
Go ask somebody.
Thanks.

76
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:15,469
Started off to be
such a great day.

77
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:41,612
Kate! Whoa. Kaitlyn.

78
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:42,647
What?

79
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:44,048
Where do you think you're going?

80
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:45,817
You're still in shock from the
defib. You need to rest.

81
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:47,217
No, I gotta go home.

82
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:49,487
Hey! You can go home
when you've been released.

83
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:52,122
How many times have you had the
same conversation

84
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:53,491
with your own patients?

85
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:55,092
I-- No, I have to go home and
take care of my mom.

86
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:56,994
She can't be without me
for this long.

87
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:58,463
I'll check in on her.
Just tell me where I need to--

88
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:00,198
Val, I'm going. I'm sorry,
but my mother needs me.

89
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:04,568
How's she holding up?

90
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,971
Well, uh, they gave her
six weeks,

91
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:10,674
and six months later, she's
still here, so... there's that.

92
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:13,811
Look, take the next
couple days off, okay?

93
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,647
I'll cover for you.

94
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:17,615
Go be with your mom
and rest.

95
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:19,417
I mean really rest.

96
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:21,686
And call me if you need
anything. Anything.

97
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:24,122
Thank you.

98
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:26,541
Oh, and say hi
to your mom for me..

99
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,424
Okay.

100
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,578
Ma'am? Ma'am! Are you okay?

101
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,619
We got vultures circling here.

102
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,456
Lacs to the chest, hands, neck,
shoulder-- take your pick.

103
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:01,826
How many times
was she stabbed?

104
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:04,395
She's lost
too much blood.

105
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:08,082
Jed! Need a large bore IV, stat!

106
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,450
Bunch of neighbours
watched it happen.

107
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,052
No one even called the cops.

108
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,287
We did what we could, but--

109
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:17,424
Gonna have to jump her.
Gimme 360.

110
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:19,360
Charge 360.

111
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:30,738
He loved me.

112
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:31,923
Clear!

113
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:25,276
What's wrong?

114
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:27,578
Nothing.

115
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:29,647
You look tired.

116
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:30,815
You're one to talk.

117
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:35,319
Don't be stubborn.
Tell me.

118
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,572
It was a nightmare.
That's all.

119
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:39,490
Everything's fine.

120
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:42,976
You know, you don't have to
sleep in that chair every night.

121
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:45,279
It's fine.
It's not!

122
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,315
The chair is no good.

123
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:49,983
That is why you're tired.

124
00:08:49,984 --> 00:08:53,487
Now, you have your own bed.
You should use it.

125
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:54,988
Swallow.

126
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:02,447
You know, I just
worry about you.

127
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:03,948
Don't.

128
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:05,866
Something is troubling you.

129
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,335
Now, I may be sick,
but I'm not stupid.

130
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:15,576
It's a patient.
Died yesterday.

131
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:19,063
She was stabbed to death.

132
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:21,182
It was bad.

133
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:23,684
I'm sure she suffered.

134
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:25,819
I'm sure you did
everything you could.

135
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,557
No, I didn't.

136
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:33,361
I couldn't do anything.

137
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:35,913
I looked right at this girl,
Mom. I looked right at her.

138
00:09:35,914 --> 00:09:38,999
And she-- she was
looking back at me,

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,001
like, into me.

140
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:44,906
Like she wanted something. Like
she wanted me to do something.

141
00:09:44,907 --> 00:09:46,891
Like she was trying to reach
out, and--

142
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:48,709
(Glass shattering)

143
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:54,882
Heavens.

144
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:03,123
Honey, just let it go.

145
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:07,778
It's all right.

146
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:09,747
(Kettle whistling)

147
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:11,749
TV:
We're at the scene of a grisly
murder of a local woman

148
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,751
where police have made
no arrests at this point,

149
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:15,619
and they have few leads.

150
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,888
The attack appears to be a
mugging gone wrong.

151
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:20,624
The tragic tale of
a desperate criminal

152
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,627
who falls upon
an unsuspecting victim

153
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:26,580
in a dark and somewhat
isolated location.

154
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:28,115
No, that's not right.

155
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:30,467
Allison Parks was simply in the
wrong place at the wrong time,

156
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:32,570
and unfortunately,
random crimes such as this

157
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:34,087
are fairly difficult to solve.

158
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,495
I can't stop thinking
about that girl.

159
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:44,048
Yeah, I know. It was horrible.

160
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,950
But the cops'll find the guy;
I'm sure.

161
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,685
No, they're giving up.

162
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:49,019
What are you talking about?

163
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,988
They're not even looking in the
right place.

164
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,457
And you know the right place?

165
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,757
Well, whoever killed Allison
knew her.

166
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:55,025
Whoa. Allison?

167
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:57,428
She said, "He loved me."

168
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:58,529
Okay, do you hear yourself?
You're not making any sense.

169
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,014
She told me.

170
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:02,866
That girl didn't tell you
anything. She was dead.

171
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:06,320
Okay, so, what?
You think I'm hallucinating?

172
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,855
You think I'm just
making all this up?

173
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:11,442
No, I don't.

174
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,744
Look, honey, I know you, okay?

175
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:15,763
And you always want to believe
that you can help,

176
00:11:15,764 --> 00:11:19,784
but sometimes we do everything,
and it's just not enough.

177
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:21,718
Yeah...

178
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:24,188
We do what we do, okay?

179
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:26,357
Let the cops do what they do.

180
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:21,011
Allison?

181
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:25,015
Allison, is that you?

182
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,821
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

183
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:36,893
You look just like her.

184
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:39,563
I thought I was seeing a ghost.

185
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:44,117
So, what'd you find?

186
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:47,788
Whole lot of nothing.

187
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:50,173
Well, nice work then.

188
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:52,476
Gave witnesses a bunch of
baseball hats to look at.

189
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:53,477
It's pointless.

190
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:55,479
What about the knife wound?

191
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,149
Nothing conclusive, but the lab
said the wounds, and I quote,

192
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,451
"Were consistent with a large
kitchen knife,

193
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:04,121
possessing precise serration,
approximately six inches long.

194
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:07,124
Yeah? Yeah, that'd do it.

195
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,893
I like the part about precise
serration. Precise serration.

196
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:12,329
It's like the lab guy is going
shopping for a wedding gift.

197
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,264
So, what? Some tweaker?

198
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:15,932
He tries to sneak a couple of
bucks out of this girl?

199
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,501
Is that what happens?

200
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:19,102
Then she starts screaming
and he just flips out?

201
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:21,188
He's got a big ol' knife
and he uses it to shut her up.

202
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,878
I don't get a lot of visitors.

203
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,796
Thank you.

204
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:35,969
Still can't believe she's gone.

205
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,173
Tragedy.

206
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:43,076
How did you two meet?

207
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:45,846
School.

208
00:13:45,847 --> 00:13:49,266
Oh. Classmates.

209
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,585
I heard there were witnesses.
Did you see anything?

210
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:54,789
I, uh-- No.

211
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you-- are you hungry?

212
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:02,997
I could heat up
some frozen dinners.

213
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:07,518
But your window is-- it looks
right out onto the courtyard.

214
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,220
You didn't see anything?

215
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:12,055
Uh, uh...

216
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:16,627
I was out, like I told you.

217
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:20,331
But I heard all about it from
the couple in 3E.

218
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,051
Horrible.

219
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:25,469
I just-- Poor Alli.

220
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,905
Just screamed and screamed
and screamed.

221
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,243
Nobody should have to hear that.

222
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:38,632
I don't understand.

223
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,434
Why didn't anyone
call the police?

224
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:43,404
It was so awful.

225
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:46,423
So loud.

226
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:51,245
Everybody figured someone else,
surely, would call the cops,

227
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:54,714
you know, after
all that screaming.

228
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:58,368
That's what happened--
must've been what happened.

229
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:02,473
Everybody just thought
the same thing:

230
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:05,792
that somebody else was
gonna take care of it.

231
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:10,631
It's not that hard to
understand, really.

232
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,767
I thought you said
you weren't here.

233
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:15,903
I wasn't.

234
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,774
So what if more than one person
called the police.

235
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:24,862
Every single one of you should
have been calling the police.

236
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,597
What do you want from me?

237
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:30,451
Sorry. I'm sorry.

238
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:33,153
It's just--

239
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:35,155
The police, they think
it was random,

240
00:15:35,156 --> 00:15:37,023
that it was a mugging.

241
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:38,859
Yeah.

242
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,828
Yeah, some crackhead.

243
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:44,932
Do you believe that?

244
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:49,436
If that's what they say.
What do I know?

245
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:51,788
I'm just trying
to make sense of all this.

246
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,224
I don't understand who would
want to hurt Allison.

247
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,831
She said something
to me about, um...

248
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:03,366
about a man in her life.
Someone she cared about.

249
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,752
Does that ring any bells?

250
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:08,188
Listen, I've explained
all this to the detective.

251
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:14,211
I barely knew her,
all right?

252
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:16,213
She was my neighbour.

253
00:16:16,214 --> 00:16:19,132
Seemed like a sweet girl.

254
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:25,773
I wave at her, in the hallway.

255
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:27,775
She gave me the keys
to her apartment

256
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:29,426
so I could go in
and water her plants

257
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:33,547
when she would go away
with her boyfriend.

258
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:36,250
That's it.

259
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,185
Her boyfriend.

260
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:41,488
Yeah, scruffy kid.
Artsy type.

261
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:42,957
But he may have
been around for months.

262
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:43,958
What's his name?

263
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,276
You and Allison were close,

264
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:49,079
and you never talked
about her boyfriend?

265
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:54,251
I've bothered you enough. Thank
you so much for the coffee.

266
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:55,719
I'm gonna-- I should go.

267
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,656
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

268
00:16:59,657 --> 00:17:02,960
We're just getting
to know each other.

269
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:04,895
I can't send you
back out in the cold.

270
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:07,147
No, really, I should take off.

271
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:09,182
Let me make us some dinner.

272
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,587
I have some frozen dinners
I can warm up.

273
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:15,089
You like brandy?

274
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,826
No, but you know, I wouldn't
say no to a glass of water.

275
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:20,778
Oh, that's no trouble at all.

276
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,836
Like ice?

277
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:31,038
You want ice, sweetheart?

278
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,284
Ow.

279
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:53,313


280
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:17,621
Hey, you all right?

281
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,291
Where is he?

282
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,659
Who? Where is who?

283
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,828
The guy with the knife!
Where is he?

284
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,112
Who?

285
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:28,748
The guy, where'd he go?

286
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:29,716
There's nobody here.

287
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,361
Okay, how about
we try this again?

288
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:44,197
I am Detective Peter Rafferty,
and you are not

289
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:48,001
a friend or relative of
Allison Parks, correct?

290
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:49,235
Correct.

291
00:20:49,236 --> 00:20:50,854
Did you know Miss Parks?

292
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,255
No.

293
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:53,723
But you have a perfectly
good reason

294
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:56,276
for snooping around
her apartment.

295
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:58,478
I was one of the nurses on duty
when she came in.

296
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:01,465
I was there when she died.

297
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:02,932
I'm gonna call that a "no."

298
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:06,569
I didn't take anything.
I was just looking around.

299
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,122
Looking for what?

300
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:09,289
Anything.

301
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,808
Somebody has to
find out who did this.

302
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,144
You're right.
Someone needs to find out.

303
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:15,946
I happen to be the
lead investigator.

304
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:20,950
I saw you on the news. Didn't
exactly inspire any confidence.

305
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,887
Ma'am, crimes like this are
fairly complicated,

306
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:26,506
but the system works.

307
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:29,977
Given enough time,
the bad guy always gets caught.

308
00:21:29,978 --> 00:21:32,829
You believe any of that?

309
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,330
I'll call that a "no."

310
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:37,467
Whoever did this,
Allison knew her. She told me.

311
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:39,102
Miss Parks told you?

312
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:41,721
She looked at me.

313
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:43,823
She looked right
at me and she said,

314
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:47,344
"He loved me."

315
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:48,645
It was the last thing she said.

316
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:49,979
Yeah, I know,
I'm just some nurse,

317
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,249
but I don't think that's
something I would say

318
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,184
if my attacker was
some random crack addict.

319
00:21:55,803 --> 00:21:57,838
Ma'am, the hospital said that
she died in the ambulance.

320
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,690
That's not-- no, that's wrong.

321
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:02,792
Well, actually, right here.

322
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:05,645
"Despite all efforts, I was
unable to kick-start her heart."

323
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:07,181
That's what it says.

324
00:22:07,182 --> 00:22:09,649
Well, sometimes there are
discrepancies.

325
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,934
Between alive and dead?

326
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,185
She was alive.

327
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:14,304
That's fine, ma'am.
Go on, please.

328
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,689
This wasn't a mugging.

329
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,060
Whoever killed Allison knew her,
loved her.

330
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:21,394
If you have any evidence

331
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:22,763
suggesting that there's some
sort of conspiracy--

332
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:25,799
Even if the hospital was wrong,
which is highly possible,

333
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,068
considering how badly they
screwed up on my tonsils--

334
00:22:28,069 --> 00:22:31,504
even if-- I mean, "He loved me"
could mean anything.

335
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:33,223
It could mean a puppy she had
when she was nine years old.

336
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:35,592
No, look, that's not it.
I know what she meant.

337
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:40,446
So you went to her apartment?

338
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,648
Yeah, I felt like I had to
help her. Somebody has to.

339
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:46,403
Why were you running?

340
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:50,173
I-- I thought I saw someone.

341
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,644
You thought you saw
someone in the apartment?

342
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:56,362
No...

343
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:57,831
Well, I--

344
00:22:57,832 --> 00:23:00,233
Look, it was dark, you know...

345
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:04,788
and... I probably
just got spooked.

346
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:08,458
And... this is gonna sound
really crazy, but...

347
00:23:10,144 --> 00:23:13,780
It was like I was imagining
the murder through her eyes.

348
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,369
I was there.

349
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,672
And then, you showed up,
and it was gone.

350
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:26,510
Just out of curiosity,

351
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:28,295
are you currently using
any psychiatric drugs?

352
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:30,597
Go to hell.

353
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:34,985
"Just out of curiosity."
That's real subtle.

354
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,920
It's not like you weren't
thinking it too.

355
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:41,992
Miss Monahan. Kate.
Hold up, please.

356
00:23:41,993 --> 00:23:44,594
Are you arresting me? Because
if not, I'm gonna go home.

357
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:47,530
Look, I am sorry about
Detective Canto back there.

358
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:50,349
He's a good cop, just not always
known for his tact.

359
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,551
Well, whatever. Forget it.

360
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:55,071
Take this, please.

361
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:57,690
If you remember anything,
anything at all,

362
00:23:57,691 --> 00:24:00,660
or if you just wanna talk,
feel free to call me anytime.

363
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,201
You know, I'm not
the bad guy here.

364
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:19,846
I don't know;
it's hard to explain.

365
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:22,248
It felt like I was really there.

366
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:25,218
But it was just like your
imagination, right?

367
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:29,155
I don't know.

368
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:31,057
I mean, it felt so real.

369
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:32,892
Do you hear yourself?

370
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:34,527
Yeah, I do.

371
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:37,497
Your brain was hit
with enough voltage...

372
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:39,382
I'm just glad you're not talking
to trees at this point.

373
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:40,683
Thank you. Thanks.

374
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:42,785
Hey, I don't understand
what you were doing

375
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:44,521
in the girl's apartment
in the first place.

376
00:24:49,076 --> 00:24:52,145
This... is Allison's boyfriend,

377
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:55,632
and I think I know
where I can find him.

378
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:57,367
You took this from a crime
scene?

379
00:24:57,368 --> 00:25:00,938
The cops aren't doing anything.
Nobody's doing anything but me.

380
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:05,758
Maybe I could help you schedule
some time up on the 4th floor.

381
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,960
Oh, my god.

382
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:08,444
I didn't mean it like that.

383
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:11,297
Listen, Valerie, I don't need
a stupid shrink.

384
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:14,000
I need somebody I can trust.
I need somebody who believes me.

385
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:15,452
You're my best friend.

386
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:18,388
Kaitlyn, you need to drop this
before you get yourself killed.

387
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:34,587
Katie?

388
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:36,289
Sorry, I'm running late, Mom.

389
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,059
It'll be ready in about ten.

390
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:00,129
(Glass shattering)

391
00:26:01,582 --> 00:26:03,249
Mom, are you okay?

392
00:26:04,718 --> 00:26:06,303
Mom!

393
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:10,089
Mom? Oh, God. Mom!

394
00:26:11,859 --> 00:26:14,327
Listen to me. Listen to me, Mom.
You're having--

395
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:16,162
Listen to me! You're having an
allergic reaction.

396
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:18,164
Just stay focused. Please stay
focused on me, right now.

397
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:19,499
I need you to calm down.

398
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,920
Breathe. This is epinephrine.
Watch.

399
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:26,990
It's adrenaline for the
swelling.

400
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,693
You're gonna feel a little
pinch, and you're gonna be fine.

401
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:32,112
All right, try and slow down
your breath.

402
00:26:32,113 --> 00:26:34,013
Slow down your breath.
Mom? Look at me. Look at me.

403
00:26:34,014 --> 00:26:36,482
Breathe. Breathe.

404
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:37,483
(Breathing)

405
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:39,085
There you go.

406
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:41,020
Good.

407
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:53,817
It's okay.

408
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:56,052
You gotta stop scaring me
like that.

409
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:00,590
What would I do without you?

410
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:16,556


411
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:52,358
Allison was taken from us
suddenly,

412
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:56,179
and without warning.

413
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,682
Her death was random
and heartbreaking.

414
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:06,706
It should remind us all

415
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:11,577
to cherish the short time we
have upon this earth.

416
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:19,302
Today may be filled
with sadness,

417
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:23,973
yet we take comfort
in our knowledge

418
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:28,928
that while Allison's body

419
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,114
has passed on,

420
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:34,651
her soul remains with us,

421
00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:38,487
now and forever.

422
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:42,191
Her memory...

423
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:47,080
provides us with
strength and guidance.

424
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:53,436
Now, please, may we bow our
heads in silent prayer.

425
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:57,857
Let us pray.

426
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:40,583


427
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,450
(Tires screeching)

428
00:30:14,451 --> 00:30:16,719
(Cars honking)

429
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:11,841
Who are you?

430
00:31:11,842 --> 00:31:12,892
I'm-- It's--

431
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:15,161
Are you a cop?
No.

432
00:31:15,162 --> 00:31:16,996
I was there when Allison died.

433
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,519
This is where we used to come
and hang out all the time...

434
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,721
listen to tracks
I was working on.

435
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:27,656
I'm a DJ, so...

436
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:33,496
You know, Allison said something
right before she died,

437
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:35,281
and I'm just trying to figure
out what it means.

438
00:31:35,282 --> 00:31:36,582
What did she say?

439
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:40,670
"He loved me."

440
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:43,105
She said it like...

441
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:44,874
she couldn't believe
this was happening to her.

442
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:49,495
Like somebody she loved
really betrayed her.

443
00:31:49,496 --> 00:31:52,632
I don't know who Alli
was in love with,

444
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,034
but it sure as hell wasn't me.

445
00:31:57,388 --> 00:31:59,222
How long had it been since you
talked to Alli?

446
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:01,774
Months ago.

447
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:02,992
Really? That long?

448
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:05,794
Yeah, Alli and I, we dated,

449
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:08,531
but that was like, 6 months ago.

450
00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:12,101
And we didn't talk since then.

451
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:14,537
Alli was a mess,

452
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:19,358
and she started going through
depression a year ago, and--

453
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,960
She was depressed.

454
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:25,248
Yeah, well, who isn't, right?

455
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:30,019
I don't know. She started seeing
some quack doctor.

456
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,155
I don't know what
they talked about, but--

457
00:32:32,156 --> 00:32:34,557
I don't know, we started
fighting all the time.

458
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:36,392
You know, she started
blaming me for shit.

459
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:40,596
For crazy shit. I just couldn't
take it anymore. I ended it.

460
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:42,198
You ended it?

461
00:32:42,199 --> 00:32:44,116
Yeah.

462
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:49,088
I mean, Alli, she was cool,
but she was out of her mind.

463
00:32:50,957 --> 00:32:54,193
I just bounced out of there
and I never looked back.

464
00:32:54,194 --> 00:32:57,830
Do you know if there was anyone
else in her life?

465
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,501
No clue.

466
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:03,937
That's between her...

467
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:05,805
and God.

468
00:33:05,806 --> 00:33:06,806
And that shrink.

469
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:08,624
Do you know his name?

470
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:12,145
Doctor, uh...

471
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:15,682
Bennett or... Barrett.
I don't know.

472
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,950
She just always
called him "Graham."

473
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:24,940
Thanks.

474
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:26,893
Why do you care
who killed Alli anyway?

475
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:30,329
Somebody has to.

476
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,701
He loved me.

477
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,451
(Screaming)

478
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,355
Go on.

479
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:06,075
Oh, um...

480
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,415
Sorry-- I lost
my train of thought.

481
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:16,318
It happens.

482
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:19,822
I don't remember
what I was saying.

483
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:21,290
It's okay.

484
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:24,260
Sometimes we lose track
of what we're talking about.

485
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:27,263
Our memories--
we get caught up in them.

486
00:35:27,264 --> 00:35:29,916
It was really vivid.

487
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:31,617
You were talking about your
mother's illness?

488
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:32,702
I was?

489
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:34,637
Mm-hmm.

490
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:35,738
My mother?

491
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:37,323
Yeah.

492
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:39,842
No, I don't think so.

493
00:35:39,843 --> 00:35:42,745
You wanna hide from this.
I know. It's okay. It's painful.

494
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:46,165
But trust me, it'll hurt less
to keep talking.

495
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,501
Yeah, I don't think so.

496
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:51,588
Did you give up your apartment
when she became ill?

497
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:56,292
Mm-hmm.

498
00:35:56,293 --> 00:35:59,295
Why? Because it was easier?

499
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:01,797
To live with her while she was
undergoing her treatments.

500
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:03,966
Look, I don't need
a pity party here, okay?

501
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:06,853
I made choices.

502
00:36:06,854 --> 00:36:09,722
But like you said yourself,
you're all she had.

503
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:11,657
No.

504
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:15,795
What do you mean?

505
00:36:15,796 --> 00:36:17,997
You gave up your own life
to take care of her.

506
00:36:17,998 --> 00:36:19,631
How does that make you feel?

507
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:22,301
That's not why I'm here.
I love my mother.

508
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:23,569
This isn't about her.

509
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:31,827
Happy birthday.

510
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:33,296
What is this?

511
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:35,881
Another day,
another body.

512
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:37,400
No, no, no, no.
Give this to Gehrke. Come on.

513
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:39,735
I can't. Reed put this on us.

514
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:41,971
Didn't even say "pretty please."

515
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:44,724
What?

516
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:46,308
Something's not right here.

517
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,994
How about we take a case
we can actually solve?

518
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:53,666
There's something this nurse
said that just stuck with me.

519
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,468
Maybe it was her
pretty blue eyes.

520
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:58,871
Oh, and this looks like just a
random mugging.

521
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:00,689
Maybe too much.

522
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,142
It's like the attacker did
everything humanly possible

523
00:37:03,143 --> 00:37:07,196
to make this look like a
case-closed mugging gone wrong.

524
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:11,183
I don't know.
Maybe she was onto something.

525
00:37:11,184 --> 00:37:13,219
The nurse that sees dead people?

526
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,720
Yeah, we should definitely
substitute

527
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:17,506
her judgement for ours.

528
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:19,825
Maybe it was somebody
that she knew.

529
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:22,261
Maybe it was somebody she knew
that disguised himself

530
00:37:22,262 --> 00:37:24,313
and made a conscious decision to
do it in a public place.

531
00:37:24,314 --> 00:37:25,614
Maybe he wanted to do it

532
00:37:25,615 --> 00:37:27,249
right in the centre of the
goddamn courtyard

533
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,717
so there would be a witness,

534
00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:30,552
a witness that would testify
that it wasn't him.

535
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:33,289
I'm gonna tell you the same
thing that you told me,

536
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,191
the first day on the job.

537
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:37,676
It's never that complicated.

538
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:41,297
DR. BARRETT:
Why are you here?

539
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:43,532
Well, I'd like to
talk about Allison.

540
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:47,836
Ms. Parks' death
was an awful, awful thing.

541
00:37:51,024 --> 00:37:52,658
And, um...

542
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:56,161
when something like that
happens, we feel...

543
00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:59,014
out of control, angry, helpless.

544
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:00,649
These are normal things.

545
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,818
It's perfectly normal
to feel these things.

546
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:05,120
There's nothing you could do.

547
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:06,521
There's nothing any of us
could've done.

548
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:10,977
Who loved her?

549
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:12,194
Hm?

550
00:38:12,195 --> 00:38:14,397
I think whoever did this
loved her.

551
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:16,182
Do you have any idea
who it could be?

552
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:20,286
I'm not about to talk to you
about my former patients.

553
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:24,941
Besides, Allison
hasn't seen me in months.

554
00:38:24,942 --> 00:38:27,226
Why not? What happened?

555
00:38:27,227 --> 00:38:30,329
Was it depression?
Was there a boyfriend? Was it...

556
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:38,104
I see our time is up.

557
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:39,388
All right, wait a minute--

558
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:41,223
But I do think it would be good
for you to come back

559
00:38:41,224 --> 00:38:43,242
and for us to keep talking.

560
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:02,211
Mom? I'm home!

561
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:09,218
Mom?

562
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:13,823
Mom!

563
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,030
Mom!

564
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:28,437
Mom!

565
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,094
Mom!
Katie?

566
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:40,232
Mom!

567
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,518
What? What is it, honey?

568
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:45,121
I was just here and I--

569
00:39:45,122 --> 00:39:46,322
What?

570
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:47,106
You were gone.

571
00:39:47,107 --> 00:39:48,624
What?

572
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:52,144
I just-- I just walked in here,
and I didn't see you,

573
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:54,747
and I thought--

574
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:56,348
I thought maybe you had wandered
off or something.

575
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,252
Wandered off? I wish.

576
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:02,772
Honey, you should relax.

577
00:40:16,303 --> 00:40:20,239
Did you hang that
picture back up?

578
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,541
You did.

579
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:24,810
I did?

580
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:27,013
Don't you remember?

581
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,500
KAITLYN:
You told me to call you if I had
any new information.

582
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,318
PETER:
That's right.

583
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:34,587
Should I come down there?

584
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:37,239
No. No, here's no good.

585
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,841
Why?

586
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:41,644
Can we do this someplace else?

587
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:43,145
Uh, you know the diner
by the hospital?

588
00:40:43,146 --> 00:40:44,680
I'm on my way.

589
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:46,265
Great.

590
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:48,551
CANTO:
What do you got?

591
00:40:48,552 --> 00:40:50,486
I've got a lead, pal.

592
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:55,725
Wouldn't happen to be a blonde,
about 5'8", would it?

593
00:40:55,726 --> 00:40:57,843
It was unique.

594
00:40:57,844 --> 00:41:00,930
Kind of like this.

595
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:02,331
Whoever killed her, took it.

596
00:41:02,332 --> 00:41:05,451
So, how do you know this?

597
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:06,885
Did you see a broken necklace at
the crime scene?

598
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:08,421
No, I didn't.

599
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:10,255
Well, she wasn't wearing it when
she came into the ER,

600
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:11,741
so find the necklace,
find the killer.

601
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:14,459
Okay, well, it's not
that simple.

602
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,479
Well, it's a clue,
so do something.

603
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,515
Okay, I bust you snooping around
the crime scene.

604
00:41:19,516 --> 00:41:21,083
Suddenly you have inside
information.

605
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:22,801
You have new evidence.

606
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:24,536
Let's consider for the moment
that I'm not a complete idiot.

607
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:25,904
You want me to believe you?

608
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:27,273
Why don't you start
by not lying to me?

609
00:41:27,274 --> 00:41:28,607
I'm not lying to you.

610
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:32,144
You're not telling me something.

611
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:34,096
Try me.

612
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,919
I'm having memories.

613
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,754
What does that mean,
"memories?"

614
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:45,057
I'm remembering the murder.

615
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:47,542
I know things
I can't possibly know.

616
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:49,444
It's like I'm reliving it
through her eyes,

617
00:41:49,445 --> 00:41:50,962
over and over again.

618
00:41:50,963 --> 00:41:53,515
I died that night too.

619
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:59,020
Listen, in the ER, we hit
Allison with the paddles,

620
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:01,590
and the electricity went through
her body and into mine,

621
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:03,542
and my heart stopped.

622
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:04,743
And once they revived me,

623
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:06,078
I started seeing things
that weren't there,

624
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,345
and having memories
that weren't mine.

625
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:08,764
If you interfere
with this case again,

626
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:10,099
I'm gonna be forced
to arrest you

627
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,467
for obstruction of justice.
Do you understand that?

628
00:42:11,468 --> 00:42:12,784
Look, I know how crazy I sound.

629
00:42:12,785 --> 00:42:14,052
Do you?

630
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:16,622
I do. Yes! I do.
But I'm not lying about this.

631
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:17,923
And she was wearing
a necklace.

632
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:20,059
No, I saw her wearing
that necklace.

633
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,428
I saw the killer take it, and
run with it, and now it's gone.

634
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:24,963
Okay, the perp
also stole her wallet.

635
00:42:24,964 --> 00:42:27,066
It would make sense
that he took any jewellery.

636
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:28,483
It still fits the scenario
of a mugging.

637
00:42:28,484 --> 00:42:30,502
It wasn't a mugging.
This was personal.

638
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:32,304
I saw him go for the necklace
like it was his,

639
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:34,773
like he wanted it back
while he was stabbing me.

640
00:42:34,774 --> 00:42:37,877
Stabbing... her, you mean.

641
00:42:37,878 --> 00:42:39,194
Oh, yeah. Yes, of course.

642
00:42:39,195 --> 00:42:41,463
Of course.

643
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:42,731
I think I can prove it.

644
00:42:44,384 --> 00:42:58,396


645
00:42:58,397 --> 00:43:01,467
I knew it!
I knew your were a cop!

646
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:03,102
Just have a couple of questions
for you, all right?

647
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:04,853
So, what, you're gonna
arrest me now?

648
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:07,756
Let's just keep the focus
on me for right now.

649
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:11,027
Look, I already told you cops
everything. So what do you want?

650
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:12,844
We want to know
about the necklace.

651
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:16,465
I don't know anything
about a necklace.

652
00:43:16,466 --> 00:43:18,433
You've never seen this before?

653
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:20,736
Yeah... That necklace.

654
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:24,106
Yeah, I know that necklace.

655
00:43:24,107 --> 00:43:25,640
What?

656
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:26,675
You give it to her?

657
00:43:26,676 --> 00:43:27,793
No.

658
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:29,178
You know who did?

659
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:32,564
Look, that was Alli's fave, man.
She wore it every day.

660
00:43:32,565 --> 00:43:34,566
I don't know. I thought
maybe she bought it.

661
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:36,135
All I know is she never took it
off, once she got it.

662
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:41,123
You mind if I go
through your gear.

663
00:43:41,124 --> 00:43:43,925
I don't have anything to hide.
You're not gonna find anything.

664
00:43:43,926 --> 00:43:45,494
You're not gonna find--
It's not like I have it.

665
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:53,519
So, what? You're not a cop,
or what?

666
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,288
No. I'm not.

667
00:43:56,289 --> 00:43:58,473
Well, so why do you know
about the necklace?

668
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:04,479
What are you,
a psychic or something?

669
00:44:09,886 --> 00:44:11,536
Well, we need to
find this necklace.

670
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:13,439
I thought you said
it wasn't that simple.

671
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,391
Honestly, at the time, I didn't
think the necklace existed.

672
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:18,377
So, what do we do now?

673
00:44:18,378 --> 00:44:20,178
Well, tell me about
these flashes,

674
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:21,413
these visions, the clues.

675
00:44:21,414 --> 00:44:24,149
How do you have them?
What sets them off?

676
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,801
I don't know, really.

677
00:44:25,802 --> 00:44:28,003
I thought I was going crazy.

678
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:30,639
And sometimes I don't even know
that they've happened

679
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,541
until after they're over.

680
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:36,495
PETER:
Well, we're about to
trigger one right now.

681
00:44:36,496 --> 00:44:40,465
If anything's going to set one
off, it's being here.

682
00:44:40,466 --> 00:44:43,168
This is exactly where
we found the body.

683
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:47,089
So you, uh, you seeing anything?
Feeling anything?

684
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,623
I don't think
it works like that.

685
00:44:48,624 --> 00:44:52,193
Okay, just relax, Kate.

686
00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:54,095
Try and remember. You've been
here before in your memory.

687
00:44:54,096 --> 00:44:58,083
So, right here, this is where
you ended up, right?

688
00:44:58,084 --> 00:45:01,687
Yeah, but I don't-- I don't
really want to see it again.

689
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:04,606
We need this, Kate.
There's nobody else here.

690
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:06,241
You're safe, okay?
Nothing bad is going to happen.

691
00:45:06,242 --> 00:45:07,475
Shit.

692
00:45:07,476 --> 00:45:10,529
Just walk me through it from
your perspective.

693
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,664
She, what? She ran out?
She tripped? She fell?

694
00:45:12,665 --> 00:45:14,533
Yeah.

695
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:16,501
Okay, and the guy is crouched
over, he's attacking?

696
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:18,903
Yes.
Stabbing.

697
00:45:18,904 --> 00:45:20,188
Yeah.

698
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:22,491
Okay. That's good.
That's good.

699
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:26,494
Can you see his face?

700
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:28,063
No, it's too dark.

701
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:30,132
Okay, just-- just--

702
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:32,034
close your eyes
and try and see it, Kate.

703
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:34,536
You want me to close my eyes?

704
00:45:34,537 --> 00:45:36,104
Can you tell me
what he's wearing?

705
00:45:38,225 --> 00:45:40,058
Um...

706
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:41,660
He's in black,

707
00:45:41,661 --> 00:45:43,662
and he's got a knife.

708
00:45:43,663 --> 00:45:45,331
Okay, good. That's good.
Can you describe it?

709
00:45:45,332 --> 00:45:47,366
It's a big knife.
It's a kitchen knife.

710
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:50,502
And... the necklace?
You have the necklace on?

711
00:45:50,503 --> 00:45:55,441
Yeah. Yeah, it's around my neck,
and, um...

712
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:02,247
And he yanks it, and takes off,
and then I wake up,

713
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:04,015
and it's the same place,
every time.

714
00:46:04,016 --> 00:46:06,018
It's the same place
I wake up, every time.

715
00:46:09,773 --> 00:46:10,773
Okay. It's okay.

716
00:46:10,774 --> 00:46:12,875
It's okay. It's all right.

717
00:46:12,876 --> 00:46:15,210
He's been watching us
the whole time.

718
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:18,263
Who?

719
00:46:18,264 --> 00:46:20,498
Please tell me you saw that.

720
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:21,766
Okay, come on. Come on.

721
00:46:25,655 --> 00:46:27,389
We're never going to
find it here.

722
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,592
Well, I'm gonna look anyway.

723
00:46:29,593 --> 00:46:31,093
He pulled it off
her neck, Peter.

724
00:46:31,094 --> 00:46:33,061
I got 14 eyewitnesses, Kaitlyn.

725
00:46:33,062 --> 00:46:35,163
The only one that saw something
is the one that wasn't there.

726
00:46:35,164 --> 00:46:39,702
So, humour me, please.

727
00:46:39,703 --> 00:46:41,270
I'm gonna check in the bedroom.

728
00:46:41,271 --> 00:46:42,504
(Phone ringing)

729
00:46:42,505 --> 00:46:44,039
Don't touch anything.

730
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,877
Hey, Val. I'm sorry, I just got
wrapped up in something.

731
00:46:48,878 --> 00:46:50,595
Can you-- No, I'm fine.

732
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:53,966
Yeah, my mom's fine too. There's
just something I need to--

733
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:56,184
I gotta go.

734
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:05,961
Any luck?

735
00:47:05,962 --> 00:47:08,163
No.

736
00:47:08,164 --> 00:47:13,001
You might be right.
I don't think it's here.

737
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:14,269
So how do we find it?

738
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,422
Well, I can add it to the
evidence report.

739
00:47:16,423 --> 00:47:18,156
With any luck, it'll turn up at
a pawn shop,

740
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:19,725
and it's not particularly
valuable.

741
00:47:19,726 --> 00:47:21,593
There's a pawn shop
over by my apartment.

742
00:47:21,594 --> 00:47:23,962
I-- I-- I've got this covered.

743
00:47:23,963 --> 00:47:26,331
It's not your responsibility,
Kaitlyn.

744
00:47:26,332 --> 00:47:28,466
Do not let this
take over your life.

745
00:47:28,467 --> 00:47:29,768
I'm fine.

746
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:33,205
I know. I know.
But I'm on this,

747
00:47:33,206 --> 00:47:35,157
with a new lead, thanks to you.

748
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:40,228
So, what am I
supposed to do now?

749
00:47:40,229 --> 00:47:42,864
You're supposed to
take care of yourself.

750
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,585
That's it. Come on.

751
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:48,887
Come on.

752
00:47:51,123 --> 00:47:54,459
DR. BARRETT:
If I could, I'd like to bring us
back to your mother's illness.

753
00:47:56,913 --> 00:47:58,113
Big surprise.

754
00:47:58,114 --> 00:48:00,232
If you could, I'd like you

755
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:02,334
to start talking about
how it felt

756
00:48:02,335 --> 00:48:03,968
when you first started
taking care of your mother.

757
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:06,288
You know, the police
don't think Allison's murder

758
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:08,356
was random anymore.
They found some new evidence.

759
00:48:08,357 --> 00:48:11,660
I just thought you might
find that interesting.

760
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:13,946
Do you find it interesting?

761
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:15,147
Yes, I do.

762
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:17,149
And your mother's illness--

763
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:19,051
Isn't.

764
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:21,369
But I did what
I had to do, you know?

765
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,005
She just got so sick so fast.

766
00:48:24,006 --> 00:48:27,876
There wasn't really time to
think about anything else.

767
00:48:27,877 --> 00:48:29,861
You know, like in the ER.
You don't think, you just react.

768
00:48:29,862 --> 00:48:32,431
She needed daily care,
and I wanted it done right,

769
00:48:32,432 --> 00:48:34,499
so... I don't know;

770
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,768
moving in with her seemed
like the only solution.

771
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:39,538
To be honest with you,
I didn't think. I just reacted.

772
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,111
I wanna be there for her,
at the end.

773
00:48:49,148 --> 00:48:52,033
So, uh, yeah...

774
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:54,203
I mean, yeah, it's--

775
00:48:54,204 --> 00:48:56,738
it's frustrating,
but she needs me, so...

776
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:59,841
Do you feel like she's
a burden at all?

777
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:04,112
No. Never.

778
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:07,482
No resentment or anger
in your difficult situation?

779
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:11,437
You're only human. I mean, it
doesn't mean you don't love her.

780
00:49:11,438 --> 00:49:16,291
She gave me everything.
She never asked me for anything.

781
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:20,061
And you want me to sit here
and whine about it?

782
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:22,097
God...

783
00:49:22,098 --> 00:49:24,132
I can see why Allison
stopped seeing you.

784
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:25,366
Just trying to help you.

785
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:27,652
When I moved in with my mother,

786
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:29,454
she said she would never
be a burden to me,

787
00:49:29,455 --> 00:49:30,522
and she never was.

788
00:49:30,523 --> 00:49:32,457
That's good.

789
00:49:35,761 --> 00:49:37,429
I'm sure she just
wants you to be happy.

790
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,380
Sometimes, accepting
your feelings--

791
00:49:39,381 --> 00:49:40,381
I found a gun, though.

792
00:49:40,382 --> 00:49:42,033
Gun?

793
00:49:42,034 --> 00:49:44,302
Yeah, I don't know
what kind it was.

794
00:49:44,303 --> 00:49:45,703
It was a handgun.

795
00:49:45,704 --> 00:49:47,872
I was looking
through her closets,

796
00:49:47,873 --> 00:49:50,542
going through some stuff,
and I found it in a shoebox.

797
00:49:50,543 --> 00:49:54,212
Didn't really make any sense,
because my mother hates guns.

798
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:55,980
Eventually I found the receipt.

799
00:49:55,981 --> 00:49:57,749
She bought it the day
she was diagnosed.

800
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,485
And what did you do?

801
00:50:02,488 --> 00:50:05,157
I got rid of it.

802
00:50:05,158 --> 00:50:07,825
Did you confront her about it?

803
00:50:13,232 --> 00:50:15,734
Kaitlyn, I think your
frustration with your mother

804
00:50:15,735 --> 00:50:17,169
and your inability to
communicate your feelings

805
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,653
is what's fuelling

806
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:20,321
your unhealthy obsession
with Allison.

807
00:50:20,322 --> 00:50:22,107
Fucking great.
Where do I send the cheque?

808
00:50:22,108 --> 00:50:24,392
You feel powerless
to help your mother,

809
00:50:24,393 --> 00:50:26,428
so you're struggling
to find a situation

810
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:27,930
that you can take control of.

811
00:50:27,931 --> 00:50:29,731
She didn't deserve to die!

812
00:50:29,732 --> 00:50:33,401
She was innocent,
and nobody is fighting for her!

813
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:35,170
They're just-- they're brushing
this thing off

814
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:36,538
like it's something random,

815
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:39,407
and I am the only one doing a
goddamn thing about it!

816
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:42,895
Okay. Okay.

817
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:51,869
I'm so tired. I can't think.

818
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,472
Yeah, it's okay.
Just take a deep breath.

819
00:50:54,473 --> 00:50:57,992
Nice deep breath.
Breathe.

820
00:50:57,993 --> 00:50:59,644
You can say anything in here.

821
00:50:59,645 --> 00:51:01,713
You can think, feel,
anything in here.

822
00:51:01,714 --> 00:51:05,550
You're safe. It's okay.

823
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:07,168
All right?

824
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:09,170
We shouldn't do this.

825
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:11,106
Oh...

826
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:23,885
We shouldn't do this.

827
00:51:23,886 --> 00:51:26,921
It's okay, Allison.
It's only me.

828
00:51:42,655 --> 00:51:45,323
What about your wife?

829
00:51:45,324 --> 00:51:47,259
She can never find out.

830
00:51:57,369 --> 00:51:59,871
Help me.

831
00:51:59,872 --> 00:52:01,440
Get off me!

832
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:03,258
You okay?

833
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,364
We were lovers.

834
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:13,251
Excuse me?

835
00:52:13,252 --> 00:52:15,086
Kaitlyn, are you okay?

836
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:17,221
Don't touch me!
Don't you ever touch me!

837
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:27,466
Man, please tell me you didn't
do what I think you did.

838
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:29,551
Peter, I know who did it.

839
00:52:33,455 --> 00:52:35,390
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

840
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:38,209
I told you we shouldn't
do this here.

841
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,346
I found a murderer. Where do you
want me to go? A fire station?

842
00:52:41,347 --> 00:52:43,432
Okay, so you saw something.

843
00:52:43,433 --> 00:52:46,218
Yeah, Dr. Graham Barrett.
Allison's therapist.

844
00:52:46,219 --> 00:52:50,255
He's the killer. I've been going
there, pretending I'm a patient.

845
00:52:50,256 --> 00:52:53,258
Dammit, Kate,
do you hear yourself?

846
00:52:53,259 --> 00:52:54,826
Hey, don't throw this
in my face.

847
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:57,029
I put myself in her surroundings
like your told me to,

848
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,565
and it triggered something.

849
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:02,667
This is not a game.

850
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:04,436
I told you to lay off,
that I would handle this.

851
00:53:04,437 --> 00:53:06,604
Allison and Dr. Barrett were
having an affair.

852
00:53:06,605 --> 00:53:08,473
I saw it. I saw it as clear
as I'm seeing you.

853
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:11,109
He kissed me-- I mean her.
He kissed her.

854
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,010
He kissed you?

855
00:53:12,011 --> 00:53:13,695
Yeah, in the memory.

856
00:53:13,696 --> 00:53:15,330
I don't really know
how else to explain it,

857
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:17,566
but he didn't want
his wife to find out,

858
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:19,735
and I guess they started
this thing on the side,

859
00:53:19,736 --> 00:53:21,136
and then it got too serious.

860
00:53:21,137 --> 00:53:22,638
And then she threatened
to go to the wife--

861
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,057
Yeah, and then he kills her to
keep her quiet.

862
00:53:25,058 --> 00:53:26,624
You have to arrest him,
right now.

863
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:29,194
I can't arrest someone, Kate,
without evidence. I just--

864
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:31,212
He killed her!

865
00:53:31,213 --> 00:53:32,713
Keep your voice down.

866
00:53:32,714 --> 00:53:34,749
Right now, all we have is your
word and your vision,

867
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,786
which is all we have right now.
That's it.

868
00:53:37,787 --> 00:53:39,520
I thought you said
you believed me.

869
00:53:39,521 --> 00:53:42,473
I do believe you, Kate. I do.

870
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:45,010
But there's protocol.
There's procedure.

871
00:53:45,011 --> 00:53:47,479
And unfortunately, your way
won't hold up in court,

872
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,880
and it'll most likely
cost me my job.

873
00:53:48,881 --> 00:53:51,316
Please tell me
you understand that.

874
00:53:51,317 --> 00:53:53,084
I understand.

875
00:53:53,085 --> 00:53:54,436
You gotta let me
run with this, Kate.

876
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:58,172
I'm not sure what I told him.

877
00:53:58,173 --> 00:54:01,893
In session, I blacked out for a
few seconds, maybe minutes,

878
00:54:01,894 --> 00:54:03,511
and I don't know what I said.
I don't know what he knows.

879
00:54:03,512 --> 00:54:05,313
What if he knows that
I know he's the killer.

880
00:54:05,314 --> 00:54:07,849
I mean, if he was willing to do
that to Allison,

881
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,884
what could happen to me?

882
00:54:09,885 --> 00:54:12,503
Nothing.

883
00:54:12,504 --> 00:54:14,238
Nothing's gonna
happen to you, Kate.

884
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,525
I won't let anything happen
to you, I promise. Okay?

885
00:54:29,671 --> 00:54:32,273
Is he still out there?

886
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:34,275
Yeah, it's his job.

887
00:54:34,276 --> 00:54:36,244
Makes me nervous.

888
00:54:36,245 --> 00:54:38,412
Peter said he wanted to have
somebody watching us all night.

889
00:54:38,413 --> 00:54:40,348
He wants us to be safe.

890
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:43,935
You better take him some coffee.

891
00:54:43,936 --> 00:54:46,054
Think so?

892
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:49,508
Well, he's gonna be sitting
outside in the cold all night.

893
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:52,760
We want him wide awake.

894
00:54:52,761 --> 00:54:53,961
It's the least we could do.

895
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:55,897
All right.

896
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:01,936
I know all about
your psychic nurse.

897
00:55:01,937 --> 00:55:04,372
Canto was right.
You are too close to this.

898
00:55:04,373 --> 00:55:07,058
Hey, Rafferty, this--

899
00:55:07,059 --> 00:55:09,477
We're not wasting any more of
the taxpayer's money.

900
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:12,129
There's no reason to keep a car
outside the nurse's place

901
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,615
all damn night.

902
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,047
Man, I did it for your own good.

903
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:55,223
Somebody order a coffee?

904
00:55:57,794 --> 00:55:58,960
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

905
00:55:58,961 --> 00:56:02,664
You are gonna give Allison a
message from me.

906
00:56:02,665 --> 00:56:04,266
Please get in the car.

907
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:05,867
Please-- please don't get out
of the car. Please--

908
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:06,884
I just want to talk.

909
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:08,653
Are you drunk?

910
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:13,107
I've been thinking
a lot about Allison, and...

911
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:16,777
Do you, still talk--
do you talk to her?

912
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:18,363
No, of course not.

913
00:56:18,364 --> 00:56:21,799
Yeah, but you're like one of
those psychics or something.

914
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,802
No, could you please
get back in the car?

915
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:26,371
Yeah, but I just
want to talk to her.

916
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:28,255
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

917
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:32,994
Aahh!

918
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:35,729
You have the right to remain
silent. I suggest you use it.

919
00:56:37,049 --> 00:56:39,384
I just want to talk to Alli!

920
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:40,752
You all right?

921
00:56:50,162 --> 00:56:51,162
You gotta cut him loose, man.

922
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:53,497
I just need a little more time.

923
00:56:53,498 --> 00:56:56,617
CANTO:
You can't charge him. You can't
hold him. You know how it works.

924
00:56:56,618 --> 00:56:58,619
We didn't find shit in his
apartment, his car either.

925
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,555
What about his alibi?

926
00:57:00,556 --> 00:57:02,173
Checked out.

927
00:57:02,174 --> 00:57:04,642
He was DJ-ing the night
that Parks was murdered.

928
00:57:04,643 --> 00:57:05,877
Yeah?

929
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:07,562
30 witnesses can
place him at the scene.

930
00:57:07,563 --> 00:57:08,813
Might be a douchebag,

931
00:57:08,814 --> 00:57:10,581
but he's not our killer.

932
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:19,624
So...

933
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:23,227
You are a pathetic little
piece of shit.

934
00:57:23,228 --> 00:57:25,863
You're gonna stay away from her.
You hear me?

935
00:57:25,864 --> 00:57:27,966
I catch you within
half a mile of her

936
00:57:27,967 --> 00:57:29,817
and I swear to God I will break
every bone in your body.

937
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:32,020
You hear me?

938
00:57:34,056 --> 00:57:35,507
Cut him loose.

939
00:57:40,346 --> 00:57:51,456


940
00:58:40,422 --> 00:58:42,356
(Knocking)

941
00:59:00,659 --> 00:59:02,427
Hey.
Hi.

942
00:59:02,428 --> 00:59:03,561
You been okay?

943
00:59:03,562 --> 00:59:06,313
Yeah, you know... You?

944
00:59:06,314 --> 00:59:09,200
Been following the shrink.

945
00:59:09,201 --> 00:59:12,136
Care you see what I found?

946
00:59:12,137 --> 00:59:14,906
My mom's asleep. This might
not be the best time.

947
00:59:17,176 --> 00:59:18,809
Any suggestion on what
I should do with all of this?

948
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:23,832
So this is Barrett's place?

949
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:27,101
Yep. Lives with his wife
on the top floor.

950
00:59:27,102 --> 00:59:29,204
The night that Allison Parks
was killed,

951
00:59:29,205 --> 00:59:30,872
he had the whole place
to himself. No alibi.

952
00:59:30,873 --> 00:59:33,691
Really?

953
00:59:33,692 --> 00:59:36,861
Yeah, wife was out of town.
Some convention.

954
00:59:36,862 --> 00:59:39,196
Turns out she goes out of town
about once a month.

955
00:59:39,197 --> 00:59:42,367
Well, then, that must've been
when he had Allison over.

956
00:59:42,368 --> 00:59:45,570
That would be my theory
at the moment.

957
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:47,188
We need to search his place.

958
00:59:47,189 --> 00:59:50,591
We need to find the necklace,
the knife... something.

959
00:59:50,592 --> 00:59:52,560
We do, but that requires a
search warrant.

960
00:59:52,561 --> 00:59:55,846
But you can get that.

961
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:57,648
The press is already
watching me like a hawk.

962
00:59:57,649 --> 00:59:59,801
They think I'm working on
another case as it is.

963
01:00:02,471 --> 01:00:05,456
But...

964
01:00:05,457 --> 01:00:09,059
I can get one.
If that's what we need...

965
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,529
I'll get one.
I don't know how,

966
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:12,863
but I'll make it happen.

967
01:00:12,864 --> 01:00:15,166
Oh, and to think,
when you first met me,

968
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,802
you were ready to toss me
in the loony bin

969
01:00:17,803 --> 01:00:20,205
and throw away the key.

970
01:00:20,206 --> 01:00:21,405
I was a little skeptical.

971
01:00:21,406 --> 01:00:23,274
Oh, a little bit? Okay.

972
01:00:23,275 --> 01:00:25,609
Well, thank you,

973
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,562
for believing in me.

974
01:00:29,764 --> 01:00:31,365
No, thank you.

975
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:34,102
For what?

976
01:00:37,505 --> 01:00:40,608
It's been a long time
since...

977
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:42,643
since I believed in anything.

978
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:50,752
Sorry...

979
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,255
Sorry! I--

980
01:01:09,738 --> 01:01:11,839
I haven't snuck a boy up here
since high school.

981
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:20,982
My mom is in the other room.

982
01:01:20,983 --> 01:01:23,184
Then we will
have to be very quiet.

983
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:49,327


984
01:03:46,861 --> 01:03:48,796
I haven't slept that well
in months.

985
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:02,243
What's wrong?

986
01:04:05,347 --> 01:04:06,680
She's not there.

987
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:10,217
What do you mean?

988
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:14,488
Your mother.

989
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:16,790
There's no one living
in that room.

990
01:04:19,094 --> 01:04:22,129
There hasn't been for a long
time, as far as I can tell.

991
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,831
What are you talking about?

992
01:04:26,234 --> 01:04:28,169
Mom?

993
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:37,679
Hey, Ma!

994
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,979
What's wrong, honey?

995
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,948
Nothing. Nothing.

996
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:43,384
That's not fun--
You're not funny!

997
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,611
Do you have someone over?

998
01:04:54,612 --> 01:04:57,915
It's Peter.

999
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:01,285
Mom, uh, this is
Detective Peter Rafferty.

1000
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:03,554
Peter, this is my mom.

1001
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:08,359
Okay, now let's have some eggs.

1002
01:05:19,237 --> 01:05:22,306
Patricia Monahan, aged 62,
died two months ago

1003
01:05:22,307 --> 01:05:25,092
from complications
from pancreatic cancer.

1004
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:26,828
That doesn't make any sense.

1005
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:29,664
Yeah, well, I'm looking right
at her death certificate, man.

1006
01:05:29,665 --> 01:05:31,031
Trust me, she ain't breathing.

1007
01:05:36,672 --> 01:05:39,907
Thanks for covering for me,
the past few days.

1008
01:05:39,908 --> 01:05:41,775
You feeling okay? You seem--

1009
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:43,511
What? Happy?

1010
01:05:43,512 --> 01:05:45,613
I was gonna say "distracted."

1011
01:05:45,614 --> 01:05:47,615
Oh, well, okay...
Peter, you know, the cop?

1012
01:05:47,616 --> 01:05:50,384
He came over last night,
and he brought some food,

1013
01:05:50,385 --> 01:05:52,253
and we had some wine--

1014
01:05:52,254 --> 01:05:55,089
Sweetie, I am so sorry.

1015
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,991
Why? I thought you'd
be happy for me.

1016
01:05:57,992 --> 01:05:59,927
Hello, Kaitlyn.

1017
01:06:04,115 --> 01:06:06,484
Wait. Wait, wait...
what is this?

1018
01:06:06,485 --> 01:06:09,703
It's good to see you again.
It's been a long time.

1019
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:11,188
No! Get away from me!

1020
01:06:11,189 --> 01:06:12,523
She's just here
to help you get better.

1021
01:06:12,524 --> 01:06:14,225
No, I don't need help!

1022
01:06:14,226 --> 01:06:16,260
I don't need this!
Let go of me!

1023
01:06:16,261 --> 01:06:18,645
You! What did you do?

1024
01:06:18,646 --> 01:06:20,965
What did you tell them?

1025
01:06:20,966 --> 01:06:22,633
What is going on?
What's going on?

1026
01:06:22,634 --> 01:06:24,001
What did you do?

1027
01:06:24,002 --> 01:06:26,186
I told them the truth.

1028
01:06:28,072 --> 01:06:30,307
Get a hold of yourself,
for God's sake.

1029
01:06:30,308 --> 01:06:32,743
I did everything. I did
everything you told me to do.

1030
01:06:32,744 --> 01:06:34,945
Calm down, now. Calm down.
We talked about this.

1031
01:06:34,946 --> 01:06:36,613
You can't just show up here.

1032
01:06:36,614 --> 01:06:38,448
You said you would
stay with me.

1033
01:06:38,449 --> 01:06:40,151
We were going to be
together forever!

1034
01:06:40,152 --> 01:06:43,253
Allison, you stop it.
You shouldn't be here right now.

1035
01:06:43,254 --> 01:06:46,423
You said you loved me.

1036
01:06:46,424 --> 01:06:47,808
Allison, I said stop it!

1037
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:49,777
What is happening to me?

1038
01:06:51,547 --> 01:06:52,680
Hey!

1039
01:06:56,919 --> 01:06:58,786
What have they got me on?

1040
01:06:58,787 --> 01:07:00,288
It's okay, honey.
Dr. Rosen's--

1041
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:01,889
No, I saw Dr. Rosen
and Dr. Barrett.

1042
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:04,725
He's-- he's trying
to keep my quiet.

1043
01:07:04,726 --> 01:07:06,760
We're trying
to help you now.

1044
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,195
Okay? It's okay.

1045
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:09,730
Valerie, he's gonna
try and kill me.

1046
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:11,532
It's okay, honey.
Just relax.

1047
01:07:11,533 --> 01:07:13,166
No, I--

1048
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:14,819
No!
It's okay.

1049
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:18,256
It's okay.

1050
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:22,826
It's okay.

1051
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:27,782
There you go, sweetie.

1052
01:07:31,603 --> 01:07:33,754
There you go, sweetie.

1053
01:07:48,152 --> 01:07:50,721
Go away.

1054
01:07:50,722 --> 01:07:54,658
I'm sorry, Kaitlyn.

1055
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:56,827
You were the only one who
believed me.

1056
01:08:01,165 --> 01:08:03,366
They're just gonna monitor you
for a few days.

1057
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:05,736
Just to make sure
everything is okay.

1058
01:08:05,737 --> 01:08:07,371
Did you tell Dr. Rosen
you fucked me,

1059
01:08:07,372 --> 01:08:09,473
or did you leave
that part out?

1060
01:08:10,975 --> 01:08:12,910
What about my mother?

1061
01:08:14,613 --> 01:08:17,147
What if she needs her shots,
and I'm not there to help her?

1062
01:08:19,467 --> 01:08:21,202
You don't need to worry about
that right now.

1063
01:08:21,203 --> 01:08:23,020
What does that mean?

1064
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:26,657
All that's important
is that you get healthy.

1065
01:08:26,658 --> 01:08:29,193
That's it: that you
get back on your feet.

1066
01:08:29,194 --> 01:08:31,095
I am healthy. I'm healthy!

1067
01:08:31,096 --> 01:08:34,047
I don't need this!

1068
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:37,084
I am so confused. This doesn't
make any sense to me.

1069
01:08:37,085 --> 01:08:38,319
Come on, we have
to help Allison.

1070
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,220
We've gotta find that necklace,

1071
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:42,256
and you have to
arrest Dr. Barrett.

1072
01:08:42,257 --> 01:08:44,124
I'm not crazy, Peter.
You know that. You know!

1073
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:46,060
Come on, I'm not crazy.

1074
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:51,332
I had a memory.

1075
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,901
A real one. It was like the one
with the necklace.

1076
01:08:56,971 --> 01:09:00,741
I want to show you something.

1077
01:09:00,742 --> 01:09:03,594
I found this in
your mother's house.

1078
01:09:03,595 --> 01:09:05,262
So?

1079
01:09:07,632 --> 01:09:09,466
I know you took this from
Allison's apartment,

1080
01:09:09,467 --> 01:09:11,452
the day I found you in the
courtyard. I know that.

1081
01:09:11,453 --> 01:09:13,187
Yeah, I had a vision.

1082
01:09:13,188 --> 01:09:15,923
The other picture fell,
and that led me to--

1083
01:09:17,926 --> 01:09:19,943
Look at what she's wearing.

1084
01:09:19,944 --> 01:09:22,579
You saw this in the photo.
Not in some vision or memory.

1085
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,081
You saw it in the photo,

1086
01:09:24,082 --> 01:09:26,583
and then you subconsciously
tied it to Allison's murder.

1087
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:33,306
No, I'm-- I never saw that
necklace. Not that way.

1088
01:09:39,614 --> 01:09:43,016
I care about you, Kaitlyn.

1089
01:09:43,017 --> 01:09:46,753
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'm here for you.

1090
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:48,722
But you have to want
to get help.

1091
01:09:50,675 --> 01:09:55,095
Hello, Kaitlyn. You came to see
me a couple of times

1092
01:09:55,096 --> 01:09:59,333
when your mother first got sick.
Do you remember?

1093
01:10:02,387 --> 01:10:06,257
How about we take these off?
Hm? And talk a little bit.

1094
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:21,238
Are you starting
to feel a little better?

1095
01:10:27,845 --> 01:10:29,780
Okay.

1096
01:10:43,594 --> 01:10:47,348
Detective Rafferty?

1097
01:10:47,349 --> 01:10:50,167
She's suffering from severe
disorientation.

1098
01:10:50,168 --> 01:10:52,803
I think the day her mother died
was so traumatic

1099
01:10:52,804 --> 01:10:55,639
she's blocked it out.

1100
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,959
Now her mind is working to try
and explain everything all away.

1101
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:04,898
Over time, and in
the right environment,

1102
01:11:04,899 --> 01:11:07,167
she'll find a way
to sort out what's real.

1103
01:11:10,455 --> 01:11:11,722
Here's my card.

1104
01:11:11,723 --> 01:11:14,658
It has my direct number.
As more questions arise...

1105
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:19,163
Thank you.

1106
01:11:28,423 --> 01:11:30,290
Kaitlyn...

1107
01:11:33,728 --> 01:11:44,655


1108
01:11:55,633 --> 01:11:58,285
Kaitlyn?

1109
01:11:58,286 --> 01:11:59,320
Kate!

1110
01:12:01,673 --> 01:12:03,457
Cop says to the hooker,

1111
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:05,492
"It's not polite to talk
with your mouth full."

1112
01:12:05,493 --> 01:12:08,428
(Phone ringing)

1113
01:12:10,232 --> 01:12:12,166
Yeah, it's Rafferty.

1114
01:12:15,203 --> 01:12:16,603
Then where the hell is she?

1115
01:12:16,604 --> 01:12:29,900


1116
01:12:53,124 --> 01:12:55,058
Kaitlyn!

1117
01:12:57,695 --> 01:12:59,829
Kaitlyn, open up! It's me!

1118
01:13:01,366 --> 01:13:03,333
Kaitlyn!

1119
01:13:26,323 --> 01:13:27,991
(Shattering)

1120
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:38,702
KAITLYN (recording):
Hi, Mom?

1121
01:13:38,703 --> 01:13:40,771
It's not important.

1122
01:13:40,772 --> 01:13:43,006
Are you okay?

1123
01:13:43,007 --> 01:13:46,243
I know. Can you just hold on
a little bit longer?

1124
01:13:46,244 --> 01:13:48,145
There's something I have to do.

1125
01:15:09,444 --> 01:15:11,594
(Screaming)

1126
01:15:16,284 --> 01:15:18,652
How did you get in here?

1127
01:15:18,653 --> 01:15:22,005
I know what you did.
I know you killed Allison Parks.

1128
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,109
I saw it. I found this.
I saw it.

1129
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:27,777
I saw everything!

1130
01:15:27,778 --> 01:15:29,346
How about we talk this through
like reasonable people?

1131
01:15:29,347 --> 01:15:31,648
Think we can do that?

1132
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,921
Kaitlyn, I didn't kill anyone.
I didn't kill Allison.

1133
01:15:37,922 --> 01:15:40,190
I found her necklace.

1134
01:15:40,191 --> 01:15:41,975
I don't know what
you think that means.

1135
01:15:41,976 --> 01:15:43,193
Proof!

1136
01:15:43,194 --> 01:15:44,645
Proof of what?

1137
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:46,813
That I gave her a necklace
as an innocent gift?

1138
01:15:46,814 --> 01:15:48,565
It's a clarity symbol.
I thought it would help her.

1139
01:15:48,566 --> 01:15:50,517
She gave it back to me.

1140
01:15:50,518 --> 01:15:53,620
No! No, stop lying!
I saw everything.

1141
01:15:59,027 --> 01:16:01,128
What have you seen?

1142
01:16:01,129 --> 01:16:03,646
I saw the way you treated her.
I saw the way you looked at her,

1143
01:16:03,647 --> 01:16:07,501
the way you threw her away when
you were done with her, and now,

1144
01:16:07,502 --> 01:16:09,636
now you're trying to do
the same thing with me, again.

1145
01:16:09,637 --> 01:16:11,387
But that's not gonna work.

1146
01:16:11,388 --> 01:16:14,040
I saw you! I saw you
murder Allison Parks!

1147
01:16:18,612 --> 01:16:20,080
Let me help you.

1148
01:16:20,081 --> 01:16:22,449
I know you think you're doing
the right thing here.

1149
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,850
I realize that,

1150
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:27,137
but I want you to listen to the
sound of my voice, Kaitlyn.

1151
01:16:27,138 --> 01:16:31,308
You're suffering from something
we call post-event information.

1152
01:16:31,309 --> 01:16:34,745
It's a-- after a trauma,

1153
01:16:34,746 --> 01:16:37,581
your memories are vulnerable

1154
01:16:37,582 --> 01:16:40,099
to facts and suggestions,

1155
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:43,603
ideas that you learn
after the tragedy has occurred.

1156
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:45,471
I saw you at the hospital
with Dr. Rosen.

1157
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:46,773
You don't know me.

1158
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:53,513
I didn't kill anyone.

1159
01:16:53,514 --> 01:16:56,266
The mind is a complicated organ.

1160
01:16:56,267 --> 01:16:59,202
Our memories are like
a jigsaw puzzle.

1161
01:16:59,203 --> 01:17:00,971
But your mind is tricking you.

1162
01:17:00,972 --> 01:17:03,857
It's creating puzzle pieces that
don't even exist right now.

1163
01:17:03,858 --> 01:17:04,925
Shut up!

1164
01:17:04,926 --> 01:17:06,643
Let me help you.
You need help.

1165
01:17:06,644 --> 01:17:08,395
I know what I saw.

1166
01:17:08,396 --> 01:17:10,380
I don't know what
you want from me.

1167
01:17:10,381 --> 01:17:12,049
I want the truth.

1168
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:14,818
I want the truth about Allison.

1169
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:16,936
I want to know what's real.

1170
01:17:20,508 --> 01:17:21,575
Real.

1171
01:17:24,078 --> 01:17:26,013
You want the truth.

1172
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,170
Truth is that we had an affair.

1173
01:17:37,008 --> 01:17:39,226
And I don't know how you--

1174
01:17:39,227 --> 01:17:40,760
This was our secret.

1175
01:17:42,963 --> 01:17:45,549
I didn't kill her.

1176
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:53,573
My wife and I, we were
having problems, and...

1177
01:17:57,195 --> 01:18:00,913
One day, after a really
emotional session,

1178
01:18:00,914 --> 01:18:02,849
Allison and I, we kissed...

1179
01:18:10,674 --> 01:18:12,943
I know that was wrong.
I know it now.

1180
01:18:12,944 --> 01:18:16,513
I never meant for it
to become serious,

1181
01:18:16,514 --> 01:18:18,215
but it did.

1182
01:18:18,216 --> 01:18:20,500
Hell, we ended up seeing each
other after every session.

1183
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:22,553
Why didn't you come forward?

1184
01:18:22,554 --> 01:18:24,187
Why didn't you come forward when
she was murdered

1185
01:18:24,188 --> 01:18:25,522
and tell people what you knew?

1186
01:18:25,523 --> 01:18:30,544
Why would I want to put my wife
through all that, after?

1187
01:18:30,545 --> 01:18:32,980
What would be the point?

1188
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:39,753
If the affair ever got out,
my career would be ruined.

1189
01:18:39,754 --> 01:18:42,122
I would be finished.
Allison appreciated that.

1190
01:18:42,123 --> 01:18:43,657
She said she understood that.

1191
01:18:46,294 --> 01:18:48,428
When I went to break it off...

1192
01:18:54,452 --> 01:18:56,787
She asked me to leave my wife,
and I told her I couldn't.

1193
01:18:56,788 --> 01:18:59,122
She threw the necklace
back in my face,

1194
01:18:59,123 --> 01:19:01,691
and she walked out the door,
and I never saw her again.

1195
01:19:04,194 --> 01:19:08,799
That's the truth.

1196
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,834
You gotta believe me.
I would never kill Alli--

1197
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:13,836
I would never hurt her.
Not in a million years.

1198
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:17,740
I loved her.

1199
01:19:17,741 --> 01:19:20,110
I love her still.

1200
01:19:23,815 --> 01:19:24,747
(Gunshot)

1201
01:20:06,491 --> 01:20:10,109
Kaitlyn, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no...

1202
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,344
I got him.

1203
01:20:11,345 --> 01:20:14,214
Okay, okay, okay. I need you to
put the gun down.

1204
01:20:14,215 --> 01:20:15,248
Help me.

1205
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:18,018
I'm gonna put my gun down.

1206
01:20:18,019 --> 01:20:19,119
He did it!

1207
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,520
I need you to put it down now.

1208
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:23,189
He killed her. You believe me,
right? That he killed her?

1209
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,190
I'm innocent!

1210
01:20:24,191 --> 01:20:25,525
Shut up!

1211
01:20:25,526 --> 01:20:28,027
Kaitlyn! Kaitlyn!

1212
01:20:28,028 --> 01:20:29,963
Listen to me, you're confused
right now.

1213
01:20:29,964 --> 01:20:31,681
Stop saying that to me.

1214
01:20:31,682 --> 01:20:33,634
Kate, this is not
about Allison, okay?

1215
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:37,220
This is about your mother.

1216
01:20:37,221 --> 01:20:41,608
Listen to me, you did everything
you could, Kate. You did.

1217
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:43,126
But sometimes,
it's just not enough.

1218
01:20:43,127 --> 01:20:44,827
You know that.

1219
01:20:44,828 --> 01:20:46,496
She loved me.

1220
01:20:46,497 --> 01:20:51,484
This, Kate, this is not,
gonna bring her back, okay?

1221
01:20:51,485 --> 01:20:55,956
Kate, I know what happened.
I read the medical files, Kate.

1222
01:20:55,957 --> 01:20:58,174
I know what happened,
the day that she died.

1223
01:20:59,326 --> 01:21:01,177
(Glass shattering)

1224
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:07,183
Did that stupid picture
fall again?

1225
01:21:07,184 --> 01:21:08,501
I'll be right there.

1226
01:21:08,502 --> 01:21:12,538
Your mother was sick, Kate.
She had cancer.

1227
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:15,909
There's not rhyme or reason
for it.

1228
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:18,011
Mom?

1229
01:21:20,014 --> 01:21:22,215
Mom!

1230
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:25,485
Mom, hang on.

1231
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:28,655
Hang on! Hang on, Mom!

1232
01:21:28,656 --> 01:21:30,222
Mom, stay with me, please!

1233
01:21:30,223 --> 01:21:32,092
You're okay. You're okay.

1234
01:21:32,093 --> 01:21:33,726
Mom, just a minute,
just a minute.

1235
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:38,465
Please, please, please hang on!
Hang on!

1236
01:21:38,466 --> 01:21:41,418
Mom! Hang on, please!

1237
01:21:41,419 --> 01:21:43,036
Mom! Please don't!

1238
01:21:43,037 --> 01:21:45,038
Mom! Mom!

1239
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:47,340
No! Please don't!

1240
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:51,978
Mom! Please!

1241
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:56,099
No! No!

1242
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,301
Mom! Mom!

1243
01:21:58,302 --> 01:22:01,537
(Crying)

1244
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:14,951
I just-- I just-- I let her die.

1245
01:22:14,952 --> 01:22:16,168
She loved me.

1246
01:22:16,169 --> 01:22:18,037
She loved you.

1247
01:22:18,038 --> 01:22:22,008
It's almost exactly what you
thought you heard Allison say.

1248
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:23,359
You see what's happening here?

1249
01:22:27,932 --> 01:22:30,800
This man did not kill Allison.

1250
01:22:30,801 --> 01:22:33,770
I know you'd like there to be
more to this, Kate,

1251
01:22:33,771 --> 01:22:34,688
but there's just not.

1252
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,740
Your mother's gone, Kate.

1253
01:22:39,994 --> 01:22:41,027
(Screaming)

1254
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,965
But there's absolutely
nothing...

1255
01:22:44,966 --> 01:22:49,652
nothing that you
can do about this.

1256
01:22:49,653 --> 01:22:51,887
Help me.

1257
01:22:55,876 --> 01:22:57,794
I thought I told you nobody
could find out.

1258
01:22:57,795 --> 01:23:00,330
(Gunshot)

1259
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:02,649
Goddammit, Kate!

1260
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:19,382
Detective Rafferty. I need an
ambulance to my location.

1261
01:23:19,383 --> 01:23:20,851
Shots fired. I have a man down.

1262
01:23:20,852 --> 01:23:22,652
Please respond.
Priority three.

1263
01:23:26,123 --> 01:23:28,658
MINISTER:
Life is precious,

1264
01:23:28,659 --> 01:23:31,878
but life is also
beyond our control.

1265
01:23:35,032 --> 01:23:37,968
While difficult to accept,

1266
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:40,770
we often have little power
over such things.

1267
01:23:47,494 --> 01:23:50,780
When our time comes,

1268
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:53,983
and our time must come,

1269
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,954
it does so without warning
or explanation.

1270
01:24:14,655 --> 01:24:19,141
Thus we should embrace
every second

1271
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:23,513
we are allowed to remain
on this vibrant planet.

1272
01:24:38,328 --> 01:24:53,276
take care

1273
01:26:44,855 --> 01:26:54,797
thank u
