00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,134
There's just
nothin' down there.

4
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,319
Nothin'. I haven't
seen a building

5
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,571
In, like, 20 minutes.

6
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:18,573
Look at that.

7
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,943
We're not on vacation,
hap, remember.

8
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,644
Cheer up, will ya?

9
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:23,812
Tell that

10
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,480
To her, partner.

11
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,032
Better hang on, guys.

12
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,367
It's gonna get rough again.

13
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,869
Whoa.

14
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,671
There goes my lunch.

15
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,739
Detective eckhart, I'm
detective ellie burr.

16
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,041
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.

17
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,208
Here, let me help.

18
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,693
Eckhart: How ya doin'?
Good.

19
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,329
Halibut fishing capital
of the world. Ok.

20
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,748
Detective dormer, such
an honor to meet you.

21
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:17,866
I'm detective
ellie burr.

22
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,367
Welcome to nightmute.

23
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,836
Got the car right here.

24
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,401
It's so incredible
to be working with you,

25
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,402
Detective dormer.

26
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,721
I've followed
all of your cases--

27
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,440
Theodore dineli,
frank prud'homme,

28
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,026
Uh, the ocean park
shootings,

29
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,694
And especially

30
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,063
The leland street
murders.

31
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,064
Is that where, uh,

32
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,899
Ronald langley cut you

33
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,868
In the basement
of 325 leland street?

34
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,753
You certainly
did your homework, detective.

35
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,121
The leland street
murders

36
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,873
Was my case study
at the academy.

37
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,192
So, I'm gonna just
take you guys

38
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,877
Over to the lodge
and drop your--

39
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,378
Just take us to the station.

40
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,747
Right.
We need to get started.

41
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,382
Most homicides
are solved

42
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,267
By work done
in the first 72 hours.

43
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,086
Well, it's 48 hours.

44
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,605
We're a day behind.

45
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,890
But who's countin'?

46
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,402
Uh, yeah, come in.

47
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,121
They got you
behind a desk, huh?

48
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,589
Charlie bubbles.

49
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,990
How ya doin', man?

50
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,509
I haven't seen you
boys since, well--

51
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:35,494
Hey, charlie.

52
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:36,745
I don't know.
7 years?

53
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,746
8 years.

54
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,232
7 years?
I am old.

55
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,333
Charlie: Ellie,
get everyone in the bullpen.

56
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,334
I gotta show you off
a little.

57
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,802
Nice kid.

58
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,803
Yeah, loves the job.

59
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,621
Yeah.

60
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,306
You know, when I called
buck for advice on this,

61
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:49,307
I never
actually expected

62
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,294
That he'd send
you guys up here.

63
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,429
Something about that
bullshit you've got

64
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,181
Going on down there
with internal affairs?

65
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,599
They're moving in,
charlie.

66
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,568
Aw, come on, man.
It's nothing.

67
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,136
It's the usual crap.

68
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,270
Buck just figured

69
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,321
You could use some help
up here.

70
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,489
They got finn and kentor
on narcotics theft,

71
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,807
Corelli on a bad shooting.

72
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,975
Now the fuckers
are wading through files

73
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,410
Looking for headlines,
but, uh--

74
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:10,028
Yeah, it's gonna
blow over.

75
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,798
Got a message here
from a guy named warfield.

76
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,699
I.A.'s pit bull.

77
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:17,385
He wants to be posted
on your movements.

78
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:18,787
I think you'll find

79
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,672
It's a bit more
straightforward up here.

80
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,673
Good guys, bad guys,

81
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,658
But a lot less
public relations.

82
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,843
It's simple...

83
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:28,947
Except for this.

84
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,683
[charlie clears throat]
ok, listen up.

85
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,519
Detectives dormer
and eckhart

86
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,054
On loan from buck lundgard,

87
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,023
Los angeles
robbery and homicide.

88
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:39,224
They'll be helping us
with the connell case.

89
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:40,225
Helping?

90
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,342
We're damn lucky
to have 'em.

91
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,944
Anything they want to see,
you show them.

92
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:45,513
Anyplace they want to go,
you take 'em.

93
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,681
This is detective
fred duggar.

94
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,666
He's been heading up
the investigation.

95
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,683
Well, hello, fred.

96
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:49,901
Pleasure.
Nice to meet you.

97
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,486
Want to get
right on it?

98
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,571
All right.
You seen what we got?

99
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:53,905
Yeah. I want to
start with the body.

100
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,157
You got the report,
right?

101
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,658
Well, I want to see
the body for myself.

102
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,526
Ok.

103
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,045
Coroner:
Clear cause of death

104
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:01,379
Was herniation
of the brain stem

105
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,648
Due to intercerebral
hemorrhage.

106
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,083
Beaten to death.

107
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,585
These contusions?

108
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,203
Coroner:
Superficial.

109
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,388
Most of the trauma
was to her face

110
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:11,840
And the top
of her neck.

111
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:14,092
Eckhart:
Any signs of rig?

112
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,393
No.

113
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,063
This one covers
an older bruise.

114
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:20,398
Coroner: There's
an older one here, too.

115
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,933
They're both in the report.

116
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,435
He washed her hair.

117
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:32,410
Scrubbed her nails.

118
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,113
Duggar: It's all
in the report, detective.

119
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,816
Doesn't say in the report
that he clipped 'em, too.

120
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,417
She could've
clipped 'em herself.

121
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,752
Nope.

122
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:43,622
No polish
on the ends of the nails.

123
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,573
She painted 'em herself.

124
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,592
Someone else
cut 'em shorter.

125
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:50,295
Toes, too.

126
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,880
Eckhart: Naked
when you found her?

127
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,582
Duggar: Yeah. Last seen
wearing a red paisley dress.

128
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,685
No fibers,
flakes, hairs?

129
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:58,920
We know about
forensics work up here.

130
00:08:58,971 --> 00:08:59,971
I told you.

131
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,939
Body gave us nothing.

132
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:03,258
Oh, she gave us
plenty.

133
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,810
All this trouble,
all this care.

134
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,978
Why?

135
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,182
Ellie: He knew her.

136
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,435
He knows we can
connect him to it.

137
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,589
This isn't some random psycho,
crime of passion?

138
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,090
Well, I don't know.
Maybe.

139
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,325
But whatever happened,

140
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,278
His reaction to it
wasn't passion.

141
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,629
He didn't panic.

142
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,881
Didn't chop her up or burn
her beyond recognition.

143
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:30,919
He just thought about what
we would be looking for

144
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,257
And then calmly removed
all those traces.

145
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,293
No haste, no rush.

146
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,095
Why would he
clip the nails

147
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,263
After
scrubbing them?

148
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,515
Well, manipulating the body.

149
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,050
Prolonging the moment.

150
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,819
Eckhart:
No mutilation.

151
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:49,321
Not this time.

152
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:51,139
You think
there's been others?

153
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,357
No.

154
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,694
But there's gonna be.

155
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,095
This guy,

156
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,363
He crossed the line,

157
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,200
And he didn't even blink.

158
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:05,153
You don't
come back from that.

159
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:10,925
Ok, let's go find out
who kay was.

160
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,230
Fred said
not to touch anything,

161
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:17,682
So I haven't tidied up yet.

162
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,468
She hates it when
I go into her room anyway.

163
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:24,322
Thank you,
mrs. Connelly.

164
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,228
Mmm.

165
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,152
So, she went to a party
Friday night?

166
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,620
Ellie: Um,
not exactly a party.

167
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:41,990
It's, um, a local dive
where the kids hang out.

168
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,908
No diary, huh?

169
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,526
We didn't find one,

170
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,579
But her mom did say
that she keeps a journal.

171
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,998
Duggar: Friends said she argued
with her boyfriend Friday,

172
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:53,852
And she stormed off
just after midnight.

173
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,888
She did, huh?

174
00:10:56,972 --> 00:11:00,258
This is interesting.

175
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:13,554
Who is this?

176
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,390
Tanya francke,

177
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,026
Kay's best friend.

178
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,778
I want to talk to her.

179
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,497
Who...Is kay connell?

180
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:24,165
Who is she?

181
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:25,950
Is she popular,

182
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,285
Or is she a loner?

183
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,336
Did she like this town?

184
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,737
Did she want to bolt

185
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,738
The first chance
she got?

186
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,208
Did she have,
uh, dreams?

187
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,709
She knew this guy.

188
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,095
We know her,
maybe we can know him.

189
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:40,415
This is designer.
This is expensive.

190
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,385
The boyfriend,
uh, randy--

191
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,419
Randy stetz.

192
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,420
He could afford this?

193
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,421
He's still
in high school.

194
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,423
Well, her mother
didn't buy it.

195
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,474
What are we
thinkin'?

196
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,109
Oh, I don't know.
Uh, stepfather?

197
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:52,977
Any rich uncles?

198
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,913
No.

199
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,149
An admirer.

200
00:11:59,768 --> 00:12:00,819
Yeah.

201
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,073
All right, I want to talk
to the boyfriend.

202
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,441
I can get him
to the station.

203
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,042
No, no. No. I want
to go to the school,

204
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,277
Where he is
in his class.

205
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,578
Pull him out
in front of his friends,

206
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,746
Catch him off-guard.

207
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,382
I want to, you know,
get people talkin'.

208
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,168
So, how far away
is the school?

209
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:18,920
[clears throat]

210
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,340
It's 10:00,
detective dormer.

211
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,175
You bet.

212
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,794
At night.

213
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:27,795
Oh.

214
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,515
So when does it get
dark around here?

215
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,966
Uh, it doesn't.

216
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,402
Not this time of year.

217
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:38,440
Yeah,
I heard about that.

218
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,108
How come you didn't
know that, hap?

219
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,200
Lower 48.

220
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,119
Lower 48?

221
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,120
You're
not from here.

222
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,705
I can tell
by your walk.

223
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,822
How's that?

224
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,508
Unsure.

225
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:57,825
Huh.
Dormer and eckhart.

226
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,210
We have
a reservation.

227
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,328
Don't be fooled

228
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,346
By my friend's
frivolous demeanor.

229
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,199
Inside, he's all business.

230
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,851
Your restaurant
still serving?

231
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,686
Yeah. Kitchen's
about to close, though.

232
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,022
Oh. Well, we'll be quick.
Thank you.

233
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,525
Thanks.

234
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,510
Eckhart: Well, we got
the halibut calabrese,

235
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,012
Got the halibut olympian.

236
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,364
Keep going.

237
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,232
Halibut cajun-style.

238
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,869
Oh, I can't wait to see
what they got for dessert.

239
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,755
Natives are
getting restless.

240
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,158
We gotta talk.

241
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,692
No, we don't.

242
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,860
You just want
to sit tight, huh?

243
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,078
Nothing's changed.

244
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,380
Nothing's changed?

245
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:36,965
What the fuck
do you think we're doing

246
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:40,385
In the halibut fishing capital
of the world, will?

247
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,470
Buck figured charlie
could use the help--

248
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:44,889
Buck figured I.A.
Would be coming to me next,

249
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:46,591
And he was right.

250
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:49,544
Warfield had me
locked in his office

251
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,229
For 3 hours yesterday,
will.

252
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,547
3 fuckin' hours.

253
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,682
Hap,

254
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,817
He's rattlin'
your cage, pal.

255
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:57,018
That's all.

256
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,270
Me and trish
talked it through,

257
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:01,556
And, uh, I'm sorry,

258
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,907
But I gotta cut a deal.

259
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:04,993
Don't even say this
shit to me, hap.

260
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,327
You're not
gonna be involved.

261
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:07,445
I'm not?
No.

262
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,746
Of course I'm
gonna be involved.

263
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,198
You're a goddamn hero.

264
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,366
With your reputation,
he can't touch you.

265
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:15,670
My reputation's
the whole problem.

266
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:17,738
I mean,
you think warfield

267
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,574
Gives a flying fuck
about you

268
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,909
Shaking down a couple
of drug dealers?

269
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,379
You think that's gonna
get him his headlines?

270
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,548
He needs the big fish.

271
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,882
He's putting
the squeeze on you

272
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,934
To get to me.
It's very simple, hap.

273
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,636
But you're clean, will.

274
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,805
I'm a good cop, yeah.

275
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,923
But there's always
something they can use,

276
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,924
You know, to get
at your credibility.

277
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,142
You know that.

278
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:40,595
Have you any idea

279
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,929
What this is
gonna do?

280
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,865
I mean, just think
about all my cases.

281
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:46,601
All the cases
depended on my word,

282
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,702
My judgment.

283
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,270
All those fuckers
back on the street.

284
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,271
Now, you think
about that.

285
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,406
That's
what you'd do.

286
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,490
That's bullshit.
They got nothin' on you

287
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,359
Because there's
nothing to get.

288
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:56,995
Dobbs.

289
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,165
What about dobbs?

290
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,417
That's different.

291
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,585
It's different?

292
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,553
Because even warfield
doesn't want shit like dobbs

293
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:06,554
Back on the street.

294
00:15:06,622 --> 00:15:08,056
It's a house
of cards, man.

295
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:10,475
Once it starts,
it's just gonna tumble.

296
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,476
All of it.

297
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,094
That's a chance
I gotta take, pal.

298
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:15,513
I got family, will.

299
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:16,964
Don't give me
that family shit.

300
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,101
Warfield made it clear:
I get probation.

301
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,102
We're cops, man.

302
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,522
This is not about us.

303
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:27,241
This is about all the
people who depend on us,

304
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,143
People with families.

305
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,896
I spent my life
doing this. My life.

306
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,666
You're gonna destroy it
like that.

307
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,368
Why? Why?

308
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,704
So some I.A. Prick
gets one step closer

309
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:41,155
To being
chief of police

310
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,841
Or playing golf
with the mayor

311
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:47,295
Or whatever the fuck
else he's after?

312
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,630
You finished?

313
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,385
Sorry. I gotta cut a deal.

314
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,524
So, make any decisions?

315
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,476
Um, boy, you do
everything around here?

316
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,810
After 11:00, pretty much.

317
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,396
Ah. Heh.

318
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,948
Over to you, will.
What are you having?

319
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:16,741
Lost my appetite.

320
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,082
Dormer: Excuse me.

321
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,489
Morning.

322
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,692
Hi.

323
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,592
What kind of calls
do you get around here?

324
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:10,211
Mostly drinking-related
problems,

325
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,914
Um, domestic abuse,
bar fights.

326
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,148
That sort of stuff.

327
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:17,552
People here,
they come from all over.

328
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,753
They come to live life
the way they want to,

329
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:19,754
So most people
keep themselves

330
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,739
To themselves.

331
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,775
Chief nyback won't
let me handle anything

332
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,760
Over a misdemeanor
anyway, so...

333
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,645
You shouldn't knock
misdemeanors.

334
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,230
No, but it's
such small stuff.

335
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,065
It gets so boring.

336
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,984
Well, it's
all about small stuff.

337
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,737
You know, small lies,
small mistakes.

338
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,272
People give themselves away
same in misdemeanors

339
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,158
As they do in murder cases.

340
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:42,794
It's just human nature.

341
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,696
Well, aren't you
gonna write that down?

342
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,472
Dormer: Friends
making you nervous, randy?

343
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,024
They think you did it?

344
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,159
You killed her?

345
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:17,829
No smoking
on school premises.

346
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:20,298
Did you love her?

347
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,668
Randy, did you love her?

348
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,870
Sure. She was nice.

349
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:28,506
"she was nice." wow.

350
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,875
Well, that makes me
all soft inside.

351
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,327
Ever occur to you
she didn't love you back?

352
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,713
She loved me.

353
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,714
Wanted me every night.

354
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,333
Oh, probably
to pass the time, I think.

355
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,518
A girl like kay connell,

356
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:45,223
She was looking for more
than some loser, right?

357
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,842
What can I say, officer?
Love is blind.

358
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:48,843
You live on your own?

359
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:49,861
On top of his grandpa's
building.

360
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,479
You don't have an alibi
for Friday night.

361
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,980
Didn't know
I was gonna need one.

362
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,348
At the party, what'd
you fight about?

363
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,683
Stuff. I don't know.

364
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,684
It's no big deal.

365
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,569
Oh, I heard
it was a loud fight.

366
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:00,037
I guess.

367
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,490
Yeah, I heard
it was pretty rough.

368
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,658
Wasn't rough.

369
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,543
Well, not like
the other times.

370
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,713
You know, those times
she wouldn't listen to you,

371
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,698
Couldn't keep
her mouth shut.

372
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,333
You keep fishing, man.

373
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,051
Eckhart: We saw
the bruises, randy.

374
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,204
They said
she was beaten up.

375
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,339
Not those bruises.

376
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,807
Randy, come on.

377
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,842
The old bruises.
Your bruises.

378
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,843
All right,
you know what?

379
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,043
I'm sick
of this bullshit.

380
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,729
I haven't
done anything wrong.

381
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,347
You haven't?

382

Hey, fuck you!

Randy.

387

This whole thing
you're doing,

388

You know,
this fuck-the-world act,

389
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:47,919
Now, that might work
with your mama.

390
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,004
It might even work with
a couple of these local cops

391
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,505
Who've known you
long enough

392
00:19:51,573 --> 00:19:54,292
To figure you're too dumb
ever to kill anyone

393
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:55,710
Without leaving
a couple of witnesses

394
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,462
And a signed confession.

395
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:01,382
It ain't gonna work with me...

Because I know things,
you understand?

I know...
You beat your girlfriend.

I know she was
seeing somebody else,

Somebody she might've
even gone to see

400
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:19,266
After she walked out on you
Friday night.

401
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,484
Now, are you
gonna tell us

402
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,820
Who that somebody
might be,

403

Or are you so fuckin' stupid

404

You're gonna leave yourself

You don't know?

408

I couldn't get her
to tell me.

409
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,268
How hard did you try?

410
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,988
Pretty hard.

You think he, um--
no.

How'd it go?

We gotta find out
where this came from.

About to dismiss

Think about it.

Look at it again.

Want me
to write that down?

on the beach.

00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:22,699
How you doing?

661
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:24,484
Ok.
Clean through, huh?

662
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,319
Yep. No souvenir.

663
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,904
Bullet got lost in
the rocks, I guess.

664
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:30,006
Well, better luck
next time.

665
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,126
You ever been shot,
detective dormer?

666
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:36,379
Yeah, I have. It kind
of itches, don't it?

667
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:39,165
We gotta catch him.

668
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,667
Did you get
a look at him?

669
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,801
When?

670
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:43,803
When, uh, I left you.

671
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:45,255
Did you see anything?

672
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:46,706
I was in whole lot
of pain.

673
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,925
And when I heard
that second shot,

674
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,761
I kept my goddamn
head down.

675
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,379
Hey, I'm--

676
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:56,599
I'm sorry about
detective eckhart.

677
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:58,601
Sorry about
that megaphone.

678
00:38:58,686 --> 00:38:59,853
Maybe if I hadn't--

679
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:01,271
Farrell, listen.

680
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,073
What were
we doing out there

681
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:05,058
Running around
in the fog anyway?

682
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,193
Were we doing it
for our health?

683
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,228
We were chasing someone.

684
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,565
So anything that happened
on that beach

685
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:13,700
Is not your fault.

686
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,752
That's the fault
of one man

687
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:17,170
And one man only.

688
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:18,455
And that's the man

689
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,375
Who beat kay connell
to death.

690
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:27,881
At this point,

691
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,350
Detective dormer
encountered officer brooks.

692
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:32,402
The suspect,
obscured by the fog,

693
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,738
Shot officer brooks
in the vastus externus

694
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,974
Of the upper left thigh.
Francis, you're farrell.

695
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,309
You were shot in the leg.

696
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:41,061
Francis:
Oh, come on, ellie.

697
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,062
Rich, when you
get this shot,

698
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,396
Make sure we get
the cone.

699
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,982
Is this his blood?

700
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,400
Ketchup maybe.

701
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,135
Was he eating
a hot dog?

702
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:56,793
Dormer: And anything
he might have dropped

703
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,662
Or stepped on
you put in a bag.

704
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:02,165
Cigarette butts,
gum wrappers,

705
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:03,583
Coins, anything.

706
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,786
A suspect will often
leave something behind.

707
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:09,672
Ellie:
Detective dormer gave chase,

708
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,958
Losing the suspect
in the fog,

709
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,176
Then heard a shot

710
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,312
Coming from
a northeasterly direction.

711
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,181
He wasn't lying that way.

712
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:19,649
How do you know?

713
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:22,569
'cause I saw him.

714
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:24,154
You need to turn this way.

715
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:25,488
Are we almost done here?

My nads are freezing off.

717
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,643
Ellie, I think
I found something!

718
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,629
Duggar: Do you think they
should start further over?

719
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,147
No, no. It's
a waste of time.

720
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,615
He stayed down
by the water

721
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,117
As far as he could.

722
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,985
I saw him
over the rocks.

723
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,787
He knew he'd
lose us down there.

[cell phone rings]

725

Duggar.

726
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,545
Where'd he find it?

727
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,297
Ok.

728
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,882
Yeah, just, uh,
let me know.

729
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,804
Ok. I will.

730
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:04,677
Dormer?

731
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,197
They found
farrell's bullet.

732
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:09,649
Looks like a .38.

733
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,868
After the autopsy,
we'll get both bullets

734
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:12,986
To the lab
in anchorage,

735
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,687
See if we can get a fix
on the murder weapon.

736
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,073
That is,
if it's ok with you.

737
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,710
A guy came by
to see you today.

738
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:22,412
Said he was
your new partner.

739
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,830
Did he leave a name?

740
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,031
Nope.

Detective?
John warfield.

746
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:33,990
He's called
a couple times.

747
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,510
Want me to lie?

748
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,930
No, it's all right.
I'll take it.

749
00:41:42,316 --> 00:41:43,466
Thank you.

00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,553
Dormer here.

751
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,888
Warfield: I was shocked
to hear about

752
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,356
Your partner there,
detective.

753
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:51,574
It's terrible.

754
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:53,392
I was actually just getting
to know him a little bit.

755
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,494
What do you want?

756
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:56,362
I think we both know
what I want, detective,

757
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,581
And I think you know eckhart
was gonna give it to me.

758
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:00,416
You know, you got
something to say,

759
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:01,618
Why don't you
just say it?

760
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:03,503
He told you about our little
conversation, didn't he?

761
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,921
Say it.

762
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:07,840
Well, let's just say
I'm very, very interested

763
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:10,293
To see your report on what
happened there yesterday.

764
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:12,795
Don't presume to know
what happened.

765
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,347
You weren't here.

766
00:42:14,414 --> 00:42:16,633
But then again,
you never are, are you?

767
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:18,635
I mean, you're always

829
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:07,326
Hello?

830
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,795
Man: Can't sleep, will?

831
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,714
Me neither.

832
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:13,165
Who's this?

833
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,017
I got a nap
this afternoon,

834
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:17,603
But I guess
you had to work.

835
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:19,772
Who am I speaking to?

836
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,357
You get rid of
your clock yet?

837
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:22,725
Won't really help.

838
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:25,311
When I first moved up here,
I once went 5 nights.

839

Can you believe that?
This crazy light.

840
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,199
A name,
or I'm gonna hang up.

841
00:49:30,283 --> 00:49:32,351
No, you're not.
You need the company.

842
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,321
Nothing as lonely
as not sleeping.

843
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,790
Feels like the whole
fucking planet's deserted.

844
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:40,526
Just you and me.

845
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,795
So, uh...

846
00:49:42,862 --> 00:49:44,296
Why don't you tell me
who I'm talking to,

847
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:46,365
And we can chat a while.

848
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,700
I can't do that.

849
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:48,751
Why not?

850
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:50,803
Not until you understand
a couple of things.

851
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,037
Like what?

852
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:56,041
I saw.

853
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:57,560
Saw what?

854
00:49:57,644 --> 00:50:00,346
Saw you shoot
your partner.

855
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,015
Saw him die
in your arms

856
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,934
On that beach.

857
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:06,852
I thought you might try
to blame me.

858
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,021
That's why
I dropped my gun.

859
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,407
My uncle's old .38.

860
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:12,408
Yeah.

861
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:13,409
Did you pick it up?

862
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:14,610
I mean, what about
the ballistics--

863
00:50:14,695 --> 00:50:16,228
Listen to me now.

864
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:19,732
I don't know what
you think you saw,

865
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,567
But, uh,
we should discuss

866
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:22,668
This thing,
don't you think,

867
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:23,736
Face to face?

868
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,621
The situation isn't yours
to control, will.

869
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:27,623
I saw you do it.
Get it?

870
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:31,093
I'll control
this situation, pal,

871
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:33,179
Because you don't
hide from me

872
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,581
In a town this small.
Get it?

873
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,133
Yeah.
No, not for long.

874
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:39,218
That's why
I need your help.

875
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,937
So don't worry about not
telling anyone anything.

876

Always with a smile

Detective dormer?

885
00:51:38,978 --> 00:51:40,830
I want to check
something with you.

886
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,699
Uh, I was going over
my report last night,

887
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,868
And I have a question
about where you think

888
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,621
That second shot
came from.

889
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,490
See, you said you heard it
from the water line,

890
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:55,127
But from the way detective
eckhart's body fell,

891
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,012
I don't think it could
have come from the rocks

892
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:59,882
Further up
from the water.

893
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:01,884
So do you think
it's possible

894
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:02,885
That maybe
you heard the shot

895
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:05,354
Before you hit
the water line?

896
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:08,190
Detective dormer?

897
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,226
Yeah, it's possible.

898
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,443
Yeah.

Everyone keeps telling me
I'm doing great considering.

924

But they're all
real worried about me.

925

They don't even care if
I show up for school or not.

They're worried
I haven't cried yet.

you gotta cry, right?

Do we have to talk
about kay right now?

to think about all that.

Get off of me.
What the fuck is this?

957
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,929
So you and kay
were like sisters.

Yes. I told you
already.

Because he was out
with you.

You were out fucking your
best friend's boyfriend.

That what best friends do?

967
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,350
Look, she never really
loved randy, ok?

968
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,652
She didn't
really love him?

969
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,653
No.

970
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:08,737
That's interesting.

971
00:55:08,822 --> 00:55:10,522
How do you figure that?
She had someone else?

972
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:11,523
I don't know.

973
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:12,992

her dresses,

Come here. I want
to show you something.

977
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,215
See? Maybe you'll understand
why I brought you here.

978
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,035
This is the spot

979
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,422

naked body was dumped,

want anyone knowing

With randy.

985
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,220
That's why you will not
give him an alibi

00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:44,890
I know that.

988
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,892
Now you tell me
who kay was seeing,

989
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,278
And we can forget
the whole thing.

990
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,446
It'll be
our little secret.

991
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:52,948
Our little secret.
But I need a name.

992
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:54,232
I need a name.

993
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,701
I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me, ok?

994
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,402
She wouldn't tell you?
What do you mean

995
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,404
She wouldn't tell you,
her best friend?

996
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,256
It was her big
fucking secret.

997
00:56:01,341 --> 00:56:02,758
Secret?
Why a secret?

998
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:04,176
I don't--

999
00:56:04,243 --> 00:56:07,763
'cause she thought
she was special and...

1000
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:09,932
She kept saying she was
gonna get out of here

1001
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:10,933
And he was gonna help her.

1002
00:56:11,017 --> 00:56:12,384
Who? Who? Who is he?

1003
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,435
I don't know.

1004
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,436
She talked
about him, though.

1005
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:15,437
Yeah.

1006
00:56:15,522 --> 00:56:16,438
She talked to you
about him then?

1007
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:17,773
Yeah.
And--and--and--

1008
00:56:17,857 --> 00:56:18,891
When she talked about him,
what did she call him?

1009
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,859
She called him something,
right? She was--

1010
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:22,111
Yes!

1011
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:24,179
What?
What'd she call him?

1012
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:28,083
Brody.

1013
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:30,769
Ok, she called him
fucking brody.

1014
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,770
But that's not
his real name,

1015
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,956
So what's the fucking
difference?

1016
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,826
Jesus, you happy now,
you fucking asshole?!

1017
00:56:45,284 --> 00:56:47,169
Ok, you did good, honey.
Come on.

1018
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:50,255
I'll let you drive.
You want to drive?

1019
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,681
It's just poetry.

1020
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:02,351
I read it line by line.

1021
00:57:02,435 --> 00:57:04,403
It's, uh,
nothing specific.

1022
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,605
Verses on nature, love,
that sort of stuff.

1023
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,657
Uh-huh.

1024
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,659
Detective dormer?
Line one.

1025
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,411
Dormer here.

1026
00:57:12,478 --> 00:57:14,113
Man:
How you holding up?

1027
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,447
Can't be easy
to keep working

1028
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:18,316
After 3 days
of no sleep.

1029
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,436
Hard to keep focus.

1030
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:22,788
I mean, are you
seeing things yet?

1031
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,440
You know, those
little flashes,

1032
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:25,924
Tricks of light?

1033
00:57:25,992 --> 00:57:26,925
Hmm.

1034
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:29,294
See yourartner?

1035
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,329
I see kay sometimes.

1036
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,498
What can I do
for you, sir?

1037
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,768
Why couldn't you tell
anyone you shot him?

1038
00:57:36,836 --> 00:57:41,390
I mean, it was
an accident, right?

1039
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:43,892
Well, I should hope so,
for your sake.

1040
00:57:43,977 --> 00:57:45,010
You know what
I'm saying?

1041
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,112
No need for threats.

1042
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,680
I'm just trying
to make you understand

1043
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,365
My own situation.

1044
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,484
See, you thought
no one would believe you

1045
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:54,352
Because of the trouble
in los angeles, right?

1046
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,706
I know what that's like,
will.

1047
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:58,707
Uh-huh.

1048
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,876
I got
the same problem.

1049
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,077
You do, huh?

1050
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,462
Mm-hmm.

1051
00:58:03,529 --> 00:58:05,664
I'm not who
you think I am.

1052
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,748
You're not?

1053
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:10,169
No. I'm not a murderer
any more than you are.

1054
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,504
Well, then why don't we
get together, you know?

1055
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:16,208
Just--just talk,
have a few beers, whatever.

1056
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,177
Yeah, throw a little gas
on the fire, huh?

1057
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,178
Yeah.

1058

[click, dial tone]

1059
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,575
I gotta go check
some things out.

1060
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:36,028
Why don't you, uh,
put this stuff

1061
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,363
Back into evidence
and tell, uh--

1062
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:39,915
What's that guy?
Fred.

1063
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,917
Fred.
You tell him, uh,

1064
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:43,085
I'll see him
in the morning.

1065
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:44,786
Oh, and can
we return this?

1066
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:46,255
Her mother might
like it back.

1067
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:47,456
Oh, sure.

1068

1070
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:10,172
Look at this.

1071
01:00:10,256 --> 01:00:13,508
That's right.
Come on. That's right.

Where else could you go
in that state?

1084
01:04:52,938 --> 01:04:55,156
Ah, and you must
have been freezing.

1085

If you want
to take a shower.

1086
01:04:56,876 --> 01:04:58,209
Should be some clean

I'm not dumb enough
to call back.

Walter finch.

1095

Will...Will dormer.

1096
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,130
What are you doing?

1097
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,798
I'm trying to help you,
and you're running around

1098
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,800
Like a fuckin' maniac.

1099
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:24,569
Were you gonna kill me?

1100
01:05:24,637 --> 01:05:26,571
How would you explain
that one?

1101
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:29,474
Well, no one
gets too upset

1102

When child murderers
are brought in feet first.

1103
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,995
There's no evidence
that I killed kay.

1104
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,614
You only know it
'cause I told you

1105
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,898
What I saw
on that beach.

1106
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,833
Come on.
What's wrong with you?

1107
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:40,502
Guess I'm a little cranky.

1108
01:05:40,586 --> 01:05:42,253
Lack of sleep, you know.

1109
01:05:42,321 --> 01:05:43,838
Get some rest, will you?

1110
01:05:43,923 --> 01:05:45,657
I've got some pills
in the bathroom cabinet,

1111
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,125
And my bed's
nice and comfy.

1112
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,443
Another night
up like this,

1113
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:49,461
And you're really
gonna lose it.

1114
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:52,213
Hallucinating, babbling.
God knows what.

1115
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:53,831
Tomorrow, when you're
feeling better, we'll meet--

1116
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:57,469
In public--
and sort things out. Ok?

1117
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,970
There's a ferry
about 5 miles north

1118
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,021
Of nightmute.

1119
01:06:00,106 --> 01:06:02,774
I'll be on the 11:00.
And, will...

1120
01:06:02,841 --> 01:06:04,476
Before you leave,
could you feed the dogs?

1121
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,027
They're on a diet.

1122

Fax from the lab.

Murder weapon was
a .38 smith & wesson.

1124
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,187
Ah.

1125
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,605
And we also found
something else

1126
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,073
Might be worth
checking out. Ellie--

1127
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,242
I found this...
At the connells.

1128
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,148
And?

1129
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,250
And it's the same author
of the book

1130
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,285
We found in kay's
backpack.

1131
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:05,903
It's signed
by the author.

1132
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,238
Turns out
he's a local writer.

1133
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,923
Kay had all his books.

1134
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:10,575
I think we should
check it out.

1135
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,711
Small stuff, right?

1136
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:16,047
Well, yeah.
Sure, sure.

1137
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,599
Nice work, ellie.

1138
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,217
She's got sharp eyes, huh?

1139
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,352
Oh, you bet your ass
she does.

1140
01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:24,055
Good stuff.

1141
01:08:07,733 --> 01:08:09,818
Will:
Oh, what a view.

1142
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:12,520
I'm not
who you think I am.

1143
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,772
No?

1144
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,141
Walter finch.

1145
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,277
Lousy writer.

1146
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,112
Lonely freak.

1147
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,197
Murderer.

1148
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,149
No?

1149
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:26,317
When I was 7 years old,

1150
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,369
My grandmother
took me to portland.

1151
01:08:28,454 --> 01:08:30,488
We were walking along,
these 2 guys ran by.

1152
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,006
They snatched her purse.

1153
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:34,259
That night, a police officer
came to our hotel

1154
01:08:34,326 --> 01:08:35,543
To ask questions.

1155
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,845
He stood the whole time.

1156
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:39,047
Uniform looked brand-new.

1157
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,166
Shoes, badge were polished.

1158
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,352
He was like a soldier,
only better.

1159
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:46,003
I have great respect
for your profession.

1160
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,222
That's why
I write about it.

1161
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,389
I even wanted
to become a cop

1162
01:08:48,474 --> 01:08:50,358
After I finished
high school.

1163
01:08:50,442 --> 01:08:52,060
I just couldn't pass
all the tests.

1164
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,194
Well, you should have
tried out

1165
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,479
For internal affairs.

1166
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,147
They'd have taken you.

1167
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:57,232
What do you want
from me, finch?

1168
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,685
After kay died,
I knew that everyone

1169
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,487
Would think
that I meant to do it.

1170
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,790
So I cleaned the body up,
removed all trace of evidence

1171
01:09:05,858 --> 01:09:07,041
Connected to me.

1172
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,994
Except
for your fuckin' novel.

1173
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:10,995
Huh?

1174
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,330
Under pressure,
you don't always

1175
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,915
See the wood
for the trees.

1176
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:17,168
You, for one, should have
figured that one out by now.

1177
01:09:26,812 --> 01:09:28,045
You know, when I heard
that they had brought

1178
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:31,349
Somebody from l.A.,
I panicked.

1179
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,717
I wasn't worried
about the locals.

1180
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,153
I knew they'd connect me
to kay eventually.

1181
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,738
I could handle them.

1182
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:40,191
They never look
in the eyes of a killer.

1183
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:41,693
Killing changes you.

1184
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,528
You know that.

1185
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,413
It's not guilt.

1186
01:09:45,497 --> 01:09:48,783
I never meant to do it.

1187
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:51,569
It's like awareness.

1188
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,904
Life is so important.

1189
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,757
How could it be
so fuckin' fragile?

1190
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,459
You'd see it right away,
wouldn't you?

1191
01:09:58,544 --> 01:10:00,411
You trying
to impress me, finch?

1192
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,747
Because you got
the wrong guy.

1193
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,800
Killing that girl
made you feel special.

1194
01:10:05,885 --> 01:10:08,186
But you're not.

1195
01:10:09,421 --> 01:10:12,056
You're the same distorted,
pathetic freak

1196
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:15,276
I've been dealing with
for 30 years.

1197
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:16,311
You know how many of you

1198
01:10:16,395 --> 01:10:18,396
I caught
with your pants down?

1199
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,781
I never touched her
like that.

1200
01:10:19,865 --> 01:10:22,433
You wanted to.

1201
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,285
Now you wish you had.

1202
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,770
Hmm?

1203
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,939
Best you could do is...

1204
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,291
Clip her nails.

1205
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,160
Now you're so different.

1206
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,245
You don't get it,
do you, finch?

1207
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:35,463
You're my job.

1208
01:10:35,547 --> 01:10:37,048
You're what
I'm paid to do.

1209
01:10:37,115 --> 01:10:39,000
You're about
as mysterious to me

1210
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,953
As a blocked toilet
is to a fuckin' plumber.

1211
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:44,505
Reasons for doing
what you did?

1212
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,957
Who gives a fuck?

1213
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:49,961
Motivations
are everything, will.

1214
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:54,131
What did you see
through the fog?

1215
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,967
I saw pretty clearly,
didn't I?

1216
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:57,769
I saw you take aim--

1217
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,854
Come on.
Forget it, finch.

1218
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,022
Shoot your partner
in the chest.

1219
01:11:01,106 --> 01:11:02,941
Oh, well.

1220
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,410
I heard him say,
"get away from me."

1221
01:11:05,477 --> 01:11:06,477
Why?

1222
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,145
Have anything to do

1223
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,147
With that internal affairs
investigation?

1224
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,916
All that tension
in your department?

1225
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,953
You think I'm
that easy, huh?

1226
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,921
I'm just saying
that's how it looks. You know?

1227
01:11:16,989 --> 01:11:19,641
I mean, maybe even
how it feels.

1228
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:24,495
How did it feel
when you found out it was hap?

1229
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,849
Guilt? Relief?

1230
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:30,802
Suddenly,
you're free and clear.

1231
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:33,221
Did you ever think about it
before that moment?

1232
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:35,356
I mean,
what would it be like

1233
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:38,026
If he wasn't there anymore?

1234
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,231
It doesn't mean you did it
on purpose, you know?

1235
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:54,659
You figure if you got
something on me

1236
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,327
Then I'm just gonna
roll over

1237
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,696
And protect
my reputation.

1238
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:02,300
Well, protect
your life's work.

1239
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:04,368
Every one of those
scumbags you put away

1240
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,636
Will be
back on the street

1241
01:12:05,704 --> 01:12:08,756
Before you even
go on trial.

1242
01:12:08,841 --> 01:12:10,708
Hap gone, you're
free and clear.

1243
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,593
Why mess with that?

1244
01:12:15,681 --> 01:12:17,315
Kay connell.

1245
01:12:17,382 --> 01:12:20,217
Remember her?

1246
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,153
It's your choice.

1247
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,441
Think of all the other
kay connells.

1248
01:12:26,525 --> 01:12:27,909
Do the math.
You're a pragmatist.

1249
01:12:27,993 --> 01:12:30,611
You have to be
because of your job.

1250
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,414
I know this
isn't easy for you,

1251
01:12:33,499 --> 01:12:35,366
But I'm trying
to get you to understand

1252
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:38,169
We're in the same
situation here.

1253
01:12:38,236 --> 01:12:39,620
You didn't mean
to kill hap

1254
01:12:39,705 --> 01:12:43,174
Any more than I meant
to kill kay.

1255
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:45,293
That's kind of hard
for them to believe,

1256
01:12:45,377 --> 01:12:47,545
So that's why
we need each other.

1257
01:12:49,414 --> 01:12:51,082
We gotta find a patsy
for the connell case,

1258
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,935
Make it stick.

1259
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,737
Do that, and you go back
to los angeles,

1260
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:58,806
And I can go back
to living my life.

1261
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:05,196
So, what do you need
from me?

1262
01:13:07,032 --> 01:13:09,067
What do they know
about me?

1263
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:14,572
Uh, they found a signed copy
of one of your books

1264
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,707
At kay's house.

1265
01:13:16,775 --> 01:13:19,460
So you're going to be
brought in for questioning.

1266
01:13:19,545 --> 01:13:20,778
At the station.

1267
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,613
Yeah, that's what
they usually do.

1268
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,082
They bring you
to the station.

1269
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,783
Brought in
for questioning.

1270
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:27,385
I could write that
easily.

1271
01:13:27,452 --> 01:13:30,338
Calm down.
It's no big thing.

1272
01:13:30,422 --> 01:13:33,290
Preliminary inquiries.
You know?

1273
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:35,393
You just tell the truth.

1274
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,896
Well, tell them about
randy, how he, uh--

1275
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:40,314
What are you talking
about randy for?

1276
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:41,349
Well--

1277
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:43,801
Talk about
your relationship with kay.

1278
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:46,154
You can't hide it,
so you just say it.

1279
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:49,306
Randy is none
of your business.

1280
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:50,608
It's not your affair.

1281
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:51,692
Well,
shouldn't I tell them

1282
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:53,161
That she was unhappy?

1283
01:13:53,245 --> 01:13:54,612
You can tell 'em
she was unhappy,

1284
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:57,314
But just let them
find randy themselves.

1285
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:58,332
You know?

1286
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:01,252
That way,
they'll make it stick.

1287
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:03,921
You understand?

1288
01:14:03,989 --> 01:14:06,290
We need a wild card.

1289
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,093
A wild card?

1290
01:14:09,161 --> 01:14:10,178
Yeah.

1291
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:13,214
Something that's theirs.
Something we can use.

1292
01:14:13,298 --> 01:14:16,434
You know, it's in every
good detective novel.

1293
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:18,436
You still have the .38?

1294
01:14:19,938 --> 01:14:21,139
No.

1295
01:14:22,641 --> 01:14:25,342
Really?
That's a shame.

1296
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:26,477
We could use that.

1297
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,696
That'd be very
convincing for them.

some overtime, huh?

1306
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:04,548
Nice.

1307
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,851
Cracking
some big cases?

1308
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:07,852
Good night.

1309
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,270
Good night, guys.

1310
01:15:50,195 --> 01:15:51,963
[telephone rings]

1311
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:54,065
[ring]

1312
01:15:55,267 --> 01:15:56,433
Yeah?

1313
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:58,986
Walter: This is always
the worst time of night for me.

1314
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:01,155
Too late for yesterday,
too early for tomorrow.

1315
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,323
What do you want?

1316
01:16:02,407 --> 01:16:03,708
I'm sorry about
the tape recorder.

1317
01:16:03,775 --> 01:16:05,326
I had to make sure
you'd follow through.

1318
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:06,777
I know
this is hard for you.

1319
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,379
I'll follow through.

1320
01:16:08,446 --> 01:16:09,446
I've been
thinking it over.

1321
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,499
I should tell them
about randy.

1322
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:15,452
I think that's
a bad idea, walter.

1323
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:17,588
But he's the patsy, will.
And besides, he deserves it.

1324
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,456
You should have heard the shit
kay told me about him.

1325
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:20,791
How he abused her.

1326
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,960
Yeah, but these are cops,
you know, walter.

1327
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,845
They're not children.
You don't just...

1328
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:26,981
Throw something like that
in their lap.

1329
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,183
Leave randy to me.
I'll push 'em toward randy

1330
01:16:29,268 --> 01:16:31,852
When the time is right.
You understand?

1331
01:16:31,937 --> 01:16:33,271
Yeah, but we don't
have the gun, will.

1332
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:34,522
How we gonna convince them
he's guilty

1333
01:16:34,606 --> 01:16:36,440
If we don't have that, hmm?
I mean, unless I tell them--

1334
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,359
Did you keep
the dress?

1335
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:39,977
Dress?

1336
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,496
Kay's dress, yeah.
Her nail clippings.

1337
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:43,698
What'd you do
with those things?

1338
01:16:43,782 --> 01:16:45,833
That's great.
Her dress.

1339
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:46,984
We could use that.

1340
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:48,319
That's even better
than the gun.

1341
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,370
We just have to
think of a place

1342
01:16:49,454 --> 01:16:50,671
Where he could have
taken the body.

1343
01:16:50,756 --> 01:16:52,039
Where'd you take her?

1344
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,041
I mean, she died
in the cabin, right?

1345
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,343
Yeah.

1346
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,545
So, where'd you take her
to clean her up?

1347
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:00,664
You don't wanna
think about that, will.

1348
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:02,383
This is tough enough
for you already.

1349
01:17:02,467 --> 01:17:03,851
But it was an accident,
right?

1350
01:17:03,935 --> 01:17:05,636
Yeah. I didn't mean
to kill her, will.

1351
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:06,887
You know that, don't you?

1352
01:17:06,972 --> 01:17:09,023
I know.
Now what happened?

1353
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,361
She called and said
that she and randy

1354
01:17:13,445 --> 01:17:15,563
Had had a fight.

1355
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:18,149
And, uh, she wanted
to come over and talk.

1356
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,401
And I said,
"meet me at our place."

1357
01:17:20,485 --> 01:17:22,370
It's the cabin at the beach.
And...

1358
01:17:22,454 --> 01:17:23,371
Yeah?

1359
01:17:23,455 --> 01:17:25,522
She comes over.
She's distraught

1360
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,241
And a little drunk.

1361
01:17:27,326 --> 01:17:29,327
And, um, you know,
she starts telling me

1362
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:32,997
About how randy and tanya
are carrying on, and...

1363
01:17:34,299 --> 01:17:35,833
I only wanted
to comfort her.

1364
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,369
Hold her.

1365
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,339
Mmm...You know?

1366
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:45,593
I kissed her and...
Got a little excited, and...

1367
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:49,146
[nervous laugh]
she started laughing at me.

1368
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:52,767
She wouldn't stop laughing.

1369
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:55,152
You ever had somebody
laugh at you

1370
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:56,737
When--when you're
like that, will?

1371
01:17:56,822 --> 01:17:58,889
I mean, when you're
really vulnerable.

1372
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,442
Laughing their ass
off at you.

1373
01:18:01,526 --> 01:18:02,893
Someone you thought
respected you.

1374
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,363
You ever have that
happen, will?

1375
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:08,916
I just wanted to stop
her laughing, that's all.

1376
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,118
And then, you know, I...

1377
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,404
I hit her.

1378
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,790
Couple of times, just to,
you know, just to stop her.

1379
01:18:15,874 --> 01:18:17,241
Let her know.
Get a little respect.

1380
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,843
And, you know,
randy did it all the time.

1381
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:20,294
I think she even liked it
when he did it.

1382
01:18:20,379 --> 01:18:21,429
You know,
she never blamed him.

1383
01:18:21,513 --> 01:18:22,797
She never wanted
to leave him.

1384
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:25,582
But, no, I do it,
and she starts screaming.

1385
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,885
She wouldn't stop.
You know? I--I--

1386
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,136
Unh! Uhh!

1387
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,771
She's terrified.
She's screaming her head off.

1388
01:18:30,856 --> 01:18:33,391
I put my hand
over her mouth.

1389
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:34,758
Then--and then,
I'm really scared.

1390
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,861
I'm like, yeah.
I'm scared shitless.

1391
01:18:36,928 --> 01:18:38,595
More scared than I've
ever been before.

1392
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:41,615
And, you know, I--
I am more scared than her.

1393
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,318
And then...

1394
01:18:44,403 --> 01:18:47,905
Everything was clear.

1395
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:49,957
There was no turning back.

1396
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:52,042
[water trickling]

1397
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:55,162
And, after that,
I was calm.

1398
01:18:57,215 --> 01:18:58,766
Real calm.

1399
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:04,171
You and I
share a secret.

1400
01:19:05,457 --> 01:19:07,525
We know how easy
it is to kill somebody.

1401
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:11,312
That ultimate taboo--

1402
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:14,798
It doesn't exist
outside our minds.

1403
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,184
I didn't murder her.

1404
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:20,821
I killed her, but it--
it just ended up that way.

1405
01:19:22,807 --> 01:19:25,576
So, where'd you take
the body?

1406
01:19:25,643 --> 01:19:27,495
Thanks for listening to me.

1407
01:19:27,579 --> 01:19:30,364
Feels good to talk
about that stuff.

1408
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,833
I'll be able
to sleep now.

1409
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:35,252
You wanna talk about hap?

1410
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,215
Morning, ellie.

1411
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:49,216
Your phone
isn't working.

1412
01:19:49,301 --> 01:19:50,968
Yeah, I know.
I turned it off.

1413
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:52,503
I needed to sleep.
You know? I'm sorry.

1414
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:53,971
Fred called that author.

1415
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,390
He said he was
more than happy to cooperate.

1416
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,058
He'll be in first thing,
so, uh,

1417
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,343
We need to get
to the office.

1418
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,344
Good.

1419
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:02,179
I forgot to tell you.
They sell these

1420
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,398
In a chain of stores
in anchorage.

1421
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,233
No way of finding out
who bought it.

1422
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:07,318
Ok.

1423
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,352
I bet you're
looking forward

1424
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:09,487
To getting back
to los angeles

1425
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,522
When this
is all over.

1426
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:15,025
Back to robbery
homicide, or...

1427
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,577
Maybe not.

1428
01:20:16,661 --> 01:20:18,579
What are you saying
to me, ellie?

1429
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:20,965
Nothin'.

1430
01:20:23,535 --> 01:20:24,585
Are--
are you doing ok?

1431
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,920
I mean, you haven't
been sleeping much,

1432
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:27,221
Detective dormer.

1433
01:20:27,305 --> 01:20:29,673
No, I haven't. No.

1434
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,547
A good cop can't sleep

1435
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:37,565
Because a piece
of the puzzle's missing,

1436
01:20:37,649 --> 01:20:38,599
And a bad cop
can't sleep

1437
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,401
'cause his conscience
won't let him.

1438
01:20:42,654 --> 01:20:44,405
You said that once.

1439
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:45,940
I did?

1440
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,412
Well, sounds like
something I'd say, doesn't it?

1441
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,251
I'll see you
back there!

1442
01:20:57,335 --> 01:20:59,236
Duggar: So you were acquainted
with the deceased--kay connell?

1443
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,255
Yes, I was.

1444
01:21:01,339 --> 01:21:04,074
In what regard
were you her familiar?

1445
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,544
You're welcome.

1446
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:07,761
How did you know her,
finch?

1447
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:10,381
She was an avid reader
of my detective novels.

1448
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,283
Duggar: When did you
meet her for the first time?

1449
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:13,300
About a year ago.

1450
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,718
She came
to one of my signings

1451
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,253
Here in nightmute.

1452
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:17,754
She hung around
afterwards,

1453
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,223
And we chatted
about my writing

1454
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:23,093
And how she wanted
to write, and...

1455
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,311
And then,
we started talking,

1456
01:21:24,396 --> 01:21:26,113
And she asked
if she could visit me

1457
01:21:26,197 --> 01:21:28,399
And talk about books
and things like that.

1458
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:29,817
And she did?

1459
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,785
We became very close.

1460
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,621
She got
comfortable enough

1461
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:35,439
To show me
some of her own writing.

1462
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:36,824
What did she write?

1463
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,158
Poetry, actually.

1464
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,493
Any good?

1465
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,777
No, not really.

1466
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:42,830
You tell her that?

1467
01:21:42,914 --> 01:21:44,415
Why would I?

1468
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,619
So, uh, exactly
what was the nature

1469
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,505
Of your relationship
to this girl, finch?

1470
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:53,807
I guess I was someone
she could talk to.

1471
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:56,460
Someone outside
of her everyday life.

1472
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:57,678
I think that's why
she needed me.

1473
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,313
Why she probably
approached me.

1474
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,131
Why'd she need you
for that?

1475
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:05,019
Well...
Her boyfriend randy...

1476
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,353
Randy stetz.

1477
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,323
Abusive little prick.

1478
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:10,491
He hit her.

1479
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:12,326
We know all this
already, finch.

1480
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:13,694
No, but it
was getting worse.

1481
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,811
So?

1482
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,497
No, but it was
a lot worse, really.

1483
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:17,498
Why
all this eagerness

1484
01:22:17,582 --> 01:22:18,949
To talk about
randy stetz, finch?

1485
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,870
Well...Oh, you're right.
I'm sorry, detective.

1486
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,004
It's probably
all hearsay anyway,

1487
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:25,322
And I--I don't want
to say anything

1488
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:26,507
That could be taken
the wrong way.

1489
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:29,043
Excuse me. Mr. Finch,
anything you say to us

1490
01:22:29,127 --> 01:22:31,428
At this stage
is in strict confidence.

1491
01:22:31,496 --> 01:22:32,829
Secondly, we're not
a bunch of hotheads

1492
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:33,830
Who are just gonna...

1493
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:36,266
Draw a bunch of crazy
conclusions. Ok?

1494
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:37,301
Ok.

1495
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,336
Please, uh, continue.

1496
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:40,471
There was
one more thing.

1497
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:41,689
It probably doesn't
mean very much,

1498
01:22:41,773 --> 01:22:44,725
But I think that kay
was getting scared.

1499
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,894
I probably have myself
to blame for that.

1500
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,345
Why is that?

1501
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:50,114
Well,
randy knew who I was.

1502
01:22:50,181 --> 01:22:52,199
Not--not who <i>I</i> was,
but...

1503
01:22:52,283 --> 01:22:53,233
He knew that she
had a friend.

1504
01:22:53,318 --> 01:22:54,735
Someone she could
confide in,

1505
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:56,036
And that made him
furious.

1506
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,355
She was always writing
about how scared she was,

1507
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,474
And her letters were getting
more and more desperate.

1508
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,710
You still have
any of these letters,

1509
01:23:02,794 --> 01:23:04,161
By any chance?

1510
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:06,463
You know, I probably do.

1511
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:07,831
Do you think it might help?

1512
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:09,800
They might.

1513
01:23:11,469 --> 01:23:13,554
Ok...

1514
01:23:13,638 --> 01:23:15,556
Anything else?

1515
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,541
The thing that
worried her the most...

1516
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,727
Was the gun.

1517
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:23,013
He had this old handgun.
He showed it to her.

1518
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:24,398
I don't know
where he got it.

1519
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:27,151
I mean, it probably
wasn't even his, but...

1520
01:23:27,218 --> 01:23:28,736
He said
he was gonna use it

1521
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:31,689
If he found out
who she was seeing.

1522
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:34,074
He kept it hidden
in a heating vent.

1523
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,994
You know,
in the skirting boards.

1524
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:41,865
Might be the .38.

1525
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,150
[mumbling]
yeah.

1526
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:44,201
Get me judge biggs--

1527
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,669
What are you doing?

1528
01:23:45,737 --> 01:23:47,037
I'm gonna get a search warrant
over to randy's place.

1529
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:48,122
You got that?

1530
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,740
Get judge biggs on the phone,
right away.

1531
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:50,874
I want everyone moving
in 5 minutes.

1532
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:51,908
I should
get over there.

1533
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,926
Hey, you know what? No.

1534
01:23:53,011 --> 01:23:54,511
No?
What do you mean no?

1535
01:23:54,579 --> 01:23:55,629
You're the guy
he's talking to,

1536
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,097
For christ sakes.
Yeah, so?

1537
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:58,215
Yeah, so, we're
waiting for the warrant.

1538
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,883
Is that ok with you?

1539
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:03,220
Francis: Ok, I'll try
that number.

1540
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:05,639
Mr. Finch, do you know
<i>when</i> randy showed her the gun?

1541
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:09,092
Walter: February?

1542
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:10,110
Francis: I'm looking
for judge biggs.

1543
01:24:10,195 --> 01:24:12,062
Walter: No. No.
Probably January.

1544
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,614
Why didn't you come forward
with this information

1545
01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:14,931
When she died?

1546
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:16,316
She swore me to secrecy.

1547
01:24:16,401 --> 01:24:17,785
She didn't want anybody
to know about that.

1548
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:18,819
Even when
she was dead,

1549
01:24:18,903 --> 01:24:20,788
She didn't
want anyone to know?

1550
01:24:20,872 --> 01:24:22,239
Beaten to death.

1551
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,240
I was honoring
her wishes.

1552
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,775
A body dumped
on a pile of garbage.

1553
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:25,776
I was her friend.

1554
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:26,777
You weren't her friend.

1555
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:27,778
All right.
Acquaintance, all right?

1556
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:28,829
We were close, and--

1557
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,081
You were close?
Mm-hmm.

1558
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,332
She was attractive.

1559
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:33,584
Did you have sex
with her?

1560
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:34,918
She was 17.

1561
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,637
17, she was attractive.

1562
01:24:36,721 --> 01:24:37,954
I suppose.

1563
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:40,007
Suppose? She was.
Right.

1564
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:41,425
Well, so did you
have sex with her?

1565
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,343
No. I was her mentor.

1566
01:24:43,428 --> 01:24:44,461
You bought her things.

1567
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:45,596
Yeah.
Gifts?

1568
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:46,930
Yes.

1569
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:47,964
What kind of gifts?

1570
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:49,483
Books, mostly.
That's what she loved.

1571
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:51,652
Books?
Mm-hmm.

1572
01:24:51,736 --> 01:24:52,936
What about this?

1573
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:54,154
You give her this?

1574
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,523
Yes.

1575
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,609
Why?
Why?

1576
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,777
You wanted to see

1577
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:00,944
How she looked
with it on?

1578
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:02,145
No.
No?

1579
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:03,280
Why would you
give her jewelry?

1580
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:04,665
It was just a present.

1581
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:06,817
Present? You bought
a lot of presents.

1582
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:07,818
You bought her
dresses.

1583
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:08,819
Yes.
What's wrong with that?

1584
01:25:08,887 --> 01:25:10,320
Well, nothing wrong.
I'm just trying

1585
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:12,790
To figure out what kind
of mentor you were.

1586
01:25:12,857 --> 01:25:13,990
I gave her things
she couldn't have.

1587
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,259
[scoffs]

1588
01:25:15,326 --> 01:25:17,845
You just wanted
to fuck her, didn't you?

1589
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:19,329
Son of a bitch!

1590
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,714
Duggar: Dormer!
Dormer! Dormer!

1591
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:21,882
Better cool off.

1592
01:25:21,966 --> 01:25:23,217
Sick bastard.

1593
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:24,518
Hey, you cool down.

1594
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:25,803
Yeah. Yeah.

1595
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:26,804
Cool...Down.

1596
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:28,004
All right.

1597
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:29,890
I need a break.

1598
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:42,836
[tires screeching]

1599
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:48,876
I have to apologize
on behalf of my colleague.

1600
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,027
He's, uh...
[clears throat]

1601
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,213
He's been under
a lot of pressure lately.

1602
01:25:53,298 --> 01:25:55,215
But, uh, he's a good cop.

1603
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:59,202
Well, I'd hate to see
the bad cop.

1604
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:02,022
[dog barking]

1605
01:26:04,008 --> 01:26:05,559
Francis:
Search and seizure warrant.

1606
01:26:05,643 --> 01:26:06,727
Yes, sir.

1607
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:09,479
Randy stetz, and we'll
fill in the rest later.

1608
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:22,559
Got our warrant!

1609
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,945
Mr. Finch, thank you.
We appreciate it.

1610
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,493
Francis, you're coming
with me. Let's go.

1611
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:46,082
You're not
going with him?

1612
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:47,234
No.

1613
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,678
[siren]

1614
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:13,627
You're not
on the connell case?

1615
01:27:13,711 --> 01:27:16,163
Yeah. I'm, uh, covering
the, uh, shooting

1616
01:27:16,247 --> 01:27:17,664
Of detective dormer's
partner.

1617
01:27:17,749 --> 01:27:19,416
Heard about that.
It's tragic.

1618
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:23,921
So, should I still call you
about kay's letters?

1619
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,472
Yeah. Call me.
I'll come pick them up.

1620
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:26,873
Ok.

1621
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:51,698
Duggar, pounding on door:
Stetz! We got a warrant.

1622
01:27:51,783 --> 01:27:53,166
We're coming in.

1623
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:11,969
All right,
turn the place over.

1624
01:28:15,606 --> 01:28:17,140
Give me a hand,
will you?

1625
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:18,992
Under there.

1626
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,848
Try over there.

1627
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:26,266
Rich, look here.

1628
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,993
Rich: I got it!
Hey, fred!

1629
01:28:50,808 --> 01:28:52,175
All right.

1630
01:28:52,243 --> 01:28:54,394
[oil dripping]

1631
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:57,514
Just in time, dormer.

1632
01:28:57,565 --> 01:28:58,932
Had it
in the motor oil.

1633
01:29:02,553 --> 01:29:05,188
What the fuck is this?

1634
01:29:07,692 --> 01:29:09,826
[police radio chatter]

1635
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:29,096
Duggar: So now he's saying
he was with tanya francke

1636
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:30,547
The night kay was killed.

1637
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:31,598
Well, that's
what she told me.

1638
01:29:31,682 --> 01:29:32,933
When?

1639
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,217
When I questioned her.

1640
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,302
Oh, that's nice.

1641
01:29:35,386 --> 01:29:36,720
Were you planning
on telling anyone or...

1642
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,855
Well, that's what
I'm doing now, isn't it?

1643
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,263
Randy and tanya were
screwing around on kay.

1644
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:48,448
Clearly she's just
trying to protect him.

1645
01:29:48,533 --> 01:29:50,067
Nyback: What's he say
about the gun?

1646
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:51,401
He says it isn't his.

1647
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:52,569
I think once we get
the ballistics match,

1648
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:55,122
He's gonna be a little
more forthcoming.

1649
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:56,289
So, uh, you leaving us?

1650
01:29:56,374 --> 01:29:57,457
First thing tomorrow.

1651
01:29:57,542 --> 01:29:58,658
If spencer can remember

1652
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:01,495
Where he parked
the plane, right? Heh!

1653
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,188
I really thought
you wanted to kill me

1654
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,756
In that interview room.

1655
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:32,809
I did.
Randy stetz is in jail.

1656
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,811
Told you I'd write
an ending they'd like.

1657
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:37,180
You were too wrapped up
in the details.

1658
01:30:37,248 --> 01:30:39,416
The details?
He's innocent.

1659
01:30:39,483 --> 01:30:41,168
No, he isn't.
He beat kay.

1660
01:30:41,252 --> 01:30:42,269
One day he'd do
something worse,

1661
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:43,603
Maybe a lot worse.

1662
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:53,597
How'd you know
I planted the gun?

1663
01:30:53,664 --> 01:30:55,298
You wanted to help me
even before I showed you

1664
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:56,683
That tape recorder.

1665
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:58,935
You had to have
a wild card.

1666
01:30:59,003 --> 01:31:00,253
You're a good man.

1667
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:03,473
I know that even if
you've forgotten it.

1668
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:05,859
When were you gonna
point them at me, will?

1669
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:09,196
When you found out where
kay's dress was, hmm?

1670
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,881
Where I took
the body, right?

1671
01:31:10,948 --> 01:31:13,349
If you have a gun
and the forensics,

1672
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:14,701
Wouldn't matter what
kind of crazy bullshit

1673
01:31:14,785 --> 01:31:16,203
I told them about you
killing your parer,

1674
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,455
Would it?

1675
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,619
May I have the tape?

1676
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,061
Did you make
other copies?

1677
01:31:41,145 --> 01:31:42,345
What?

1678
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:43,546
Did you make
other copies?

1679
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:44,731
Why would I?

1680
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:47,767
To stop me
from turning you in.

1681
01:31:47,852 --> 01:31:48,935
Or killing you.

1682
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,403
I don't have
a hold over you, will.

1683
01:31:50,488 --> 01:31:52,522
I never did. You made
your own choices.

1684
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:53,740
It's like
I wasn't even here.

1685
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:56,826
Why kill me? It's not
gonna help randy.

1686
01:31:56,894 --> 01:31:58,895
After your little scene
at the police department,

1687
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:00,764
It's not gonna do you
any good if I show up dead.

1688
01:32:00,831 --> 01:32:02,532
A lot of ways
a man can die.

1689
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,668
Like an accident, huh?

1690
01:32:04,735 --> 01:32:07,387
Like hap. Like kay.

1691
01:32:10,208 --> 01:32:12,259
It took you 10 minutes

1692
01:32:12,343 --> 01:32:13,927
To beat kay connell
to death.

1693
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:16,796
10 fucking minutes.

1694
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,299
You calling that
an accident?

1695
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,750
It took you only
a fraction of a second

1696
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,135
To kill your partner.
Does that make it

1697
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:25,388
Any more
of an accident, will?

1698
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:29,776
Is this an accident?

1699
01:32:32,897 --> 01:32:34,864
If you want it to be.

1700
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,631
It's over, walter.

1701
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:53,950
It's over.

1702
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:56,086
I'm gonna tell them
everything.

1703
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:57,804
Tell them about hap,
about you, about everything.

1704
01:32:57,872 --> 01:32:58,939
What good
would that do, will?

1705
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:00,540
It'll end
this fucking thing.

1706
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:01,841
It's not gonna end it.

1707
01:33:01,926 --> 01:33:03,176
You haven't
had any sleep.

1708
01:33:03,261 --> 01:33:04,294
You're not thinking
straight, will.

1709
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:05,795
What are you gonna do--
tell them the truth?

1710
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:07,180
You shot your partner,

1711
01:33:07,265 --> 01:33:08,982
And you lied
about it, will.

1712
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:12,135
To them, you're a liar,
and you're a killer.

1713
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:13,937
You're tainted forever.

1714
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,773
You don't get to pick
when you tell the truth.

1715
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,410
The truth is
beyond that.

1716
01:33:20,477 --> 01:33:21,978
That tape was
the only physical proof

1717
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:24,030
That you and I ever had
a conversation

1718
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:26,833
Outside of that
interview room.

1719
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:28,251
To them
I'm just a writer

1720
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:29,636
That kay connell
admired,

1721
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:31,338
And randy stetz
is a killer,

1722
01:33:31,422 --> 01:33:32,422
And you're a hero cop.

1723
01:33:32,489 --> 01:33:34,490
Your life's work
is intact.

1724
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:37,210
Another abusive scumbag
is in jail.

1725
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,045
Everything is
as it should be.

1726
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,548
Go back
to los angeles, will.

1727
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,551
The case against randy
is pretty solid.

1728
01:33:44,635 --> 01:33:46,219
And I can take care
of everything up here.

1729
01:33:46,304 --> 01:33:48,004
I got it all worked out.

1730
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:50,190
Go home.

1731
01:33:55,446 --> 01:33:57,063
Walter: Midnight
of your sixth night.

1732
01:33:57,131 --> 01:33:59,899
You broke
my record, will.

Farrell:
Randy stetz.

1735
01:34:39,723 --> 01:34:40,990
He was an asshole.

1736
01:34:41,058 --> 01:34:42,242
Duggar: You knew him
when he was a little kid?

1737
01:34:42,309 --> 01:34:43,610
Our dads were
on the same boat.

1738
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:44,861
Used to wait
for them together.

1739
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:45,912
Bad seed, man.

1740

like our beer?

[all laughing]

1742
01:34:53,954 --> 01:34:56,756
Duggar: I think what dormer
needs is a little shut-eye.

1743
01:34:56,824 --> 01:34:57,907
White nights
getting to you?

1744
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,242
Hasn't been easy.

1745
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:00,960
Farrell:
Better than winter.

1746
01:35:01,045 --> 01:35:02,545
Rich: You got that right.

1747
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:04,130
In winter,
the sun barely comes up

1748
01:35:04,215 --> 01:35:05,348
For 5 months straight.

1749
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:07,801
Duggar: Like you're being
sucked into a black hole.

1750
01:35:07,885 --> 01:35:08,968
Ellie: Hi, guys.

1751
01:35:09,053 --> 01:35:11,938
Hey, nancy drew,
you hear? We got him.

1752
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:13,139
Farrell:
Rich found the gun.

1753
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:15,258
I heard.

1754
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:17,444
Oh, nancy's got
something on her mind.

1755
01:35:17,528 --> 01:35:19,062
I found this
out on the beach.

1756
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,063
What is it?

1757
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,399
Shell casing, 9mm.

1758
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,284
The murder weapon
was a .38,

1759
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:26,569
And none of us carries
a 9mm duty weapon...

1760
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:28,738
Or backup weapon, right?

1761
01:35:28,789 --> 01:35:30,790
Duggar:
Come on!

1762
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:33,576
Get a hobby,
would you?

1763
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:34,711
What? It's
a legitimate point,

1764
01:35:34,778 --> 01:35:36,963
Isn't it,
detective dormer?

1765
01:35:40,217 --> 01:35:42,085
Oh, this case
is closed, ellie.

1766
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:45,221
Hold the fort, boys.
I'm just gonna go

1767
01:35:45,289 --> 01:35:47,590
Find the men's room.

1768
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:48,675
Relieve myself
of some of your

Fine alaskan beer.

1770
01:35:51,228 --> 01:35:53,396
Hey, do you want
a beer or something?

1771
01:35:53,464 --> 01:35:55,682
No, thanks.

1772
01:35:55,766 --> 01:35:57,600
Rich: He's good people,
right?

1773
01:35:57,668 --> 01:36:01,237
Duggar: Don't get
carried away.

1774

Hey, farrell,
what has 2 thumbs

And loves blow jobs?

I don't know.

01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:10,697
Sorry.

1780
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:18,705
Well, it's been
something, dormer.

1781
01:36:19,924 --> 01:36:22,709
It's been really great
working with you.

1782
01:36:26,714 --> 01:36:28,164
You gonna run will
to the airport?

1783
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:30,683
No, I gotta go pick up
those letters from finch...

1784
01:36:30,751 --> 01:36:31,935
He lives
in umkumiut.

1785
01:36:32,002 --> 01:36:34,170
At his lake house,
and detective dormer

1786
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:36,723
Will just have to leave
my car at the dock.

1787
01:36:36,807 --> 01:36:38,007
If that's ok with you.

1788
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:40,693
Yeah, it's fine.

1789
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:46,699
Farrell: You don't think
I tried to tell her that?

1790
01:36:46,767 --> 01:36:48,868
It's been a pleasure.
Yeah.

1791
01:36:48,953 --> 01:36:50,737
Get some sleep.

1792
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:15,905
Rachel, knocking:
Detective dormer?

1793
01:38:16,874 --> 01:38:17,991
What is it?

1794
01:38:18,075 --> 01:38:20,443
Someone's complaining
about the noise.

1795
01:38:20,494 --> 01:38:22,328
He says he can't sleep.

1796
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:23,997
Something wrong?

1797
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,632
Well, uh,

1798
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:28,835
It's so fucking
bright in here.

1799
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:31,921
Look.

1800
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:33,356
No, it's dark in here.

1801
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,947
Please...

1802
01:38:54,862 --> 01:38:58,314
There's this guy.
Wayne dobbs, 24,

1803
01:38:58,365 --> 01:39:00,867
Works part-time
in a copy store.

1804
01:39:00,951 --> 01:39:04,754
Every day, he watches
this 8-year-old boy

1805
01:39:04,821 --> 01:39:08,324
Waiting for his carpool
across the street.

1806
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:10,326
This is one of
your cases?

1807
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:12,879
Yeah. Hap and me.

1808
01:39:12,963 --> 01:39:14,631
A year and a half ago.

1809
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:17,467
For 6 months,
he watches this kid.

1810
01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:20,219
Finally gets up the nerve,
he goes down there,

1811
01:39:20,304 --> 01:39:23,773
Grabs that boy
before the carpool comes,

1812
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,443
Takes him back
to his apartment,

1813
01:39:27,511 --> 01:39:30,730
And keeps him there
for 3 days.

1814
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:35,652
He tortures m, and...

1815
01:39:37,905 --> 01:39:40,123
Makes him do things,

1816
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:41,524
And finally he's had
enough.

1817
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:43,526
He gets a rope,

1818
01:39:43,577 --> 01:39:46,663
And he hangs the boy
in a storage space

1819
01:39:46,714 --> 01:39:48,331
In the basement
of the building.

1820
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:51,000
But he didn't do it
right.

1821
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:53,202
The little boy's neck
didn't break, so...

1822
01:39:53,253 --> 01:39:55,871
He just dangled there
for a while

1823
01:39:55,923 --> 01:39:59,926
And then died finally
from the shock.

1824
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:04,347
Landlord found the body
5 days later.

1825
01:40:04,398 --> 01:40:06,599
The second I met
this guy dobbs,

1826
01:40:06,684 --> 01:40:08,101
I knewe was guilty.

1827
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:09,936
That's what I do.
That's my job.

1828
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:11,887
I assign guilt.

1829
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:14,223
You find the evidence,

1830
01:40:14,274 --> 01:40:15,858
Figure out who did it,

1831
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:19,529
And then you go get them
and put them away.

1832
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:23,366
This time, there wasn't
enough evidence,

1833
01:40:23,434 --> 01:40:26,419
And it's reasonable doubt
to a jury,

1834
01:40:26,503 --> 01:40:29,238
Because a jury never...

1835
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:31,924
Met a child murderer
before...

1836
01:40:32,009 --> 01:40:33,543
But I have.

1837
01:40:35,596 --> 01:40:37,013
Anyway...

1838
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:40,299
I, uh...

1839
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,418
I went and took
some blood samples

1840
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:45,471
From the boy's
dead body.

1841
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:49,475
And I planted them...

1842
01:40:52,529 --> 01:40:54,864
In dobbs' apartment.

1843
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,905
I could feel it
right there.

1844
01:41:02,956 --> 01:41:05,992
This is gonna
catch up with me.

1845
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,944
I don't do things
like that.

1846
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:10,880
So how did it
catch up with you?

1847
01:41:10,947 --> 01:41:12,999
Internal affairs
was coming down

1848
01:41:13,083 --> 01:41:14,417
On our department,

1849
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:18,504
And hap, he was
gonna cut a deal...

1850
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,642
And bring me
straight in with it.

1851
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:25,228
They would've
reopened dobbs' case,

1852
01:41:25,295 --> 01:41:26,479
And he'd have walked.

1853
01:41:26,563 --> 01:41:28,147
Now that's
not gonna happen.

1854
01:41:28,232 --> 01:41:29,982
And I don't know how...

1855
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:33,219
How I feel about that.

1856
01:41:34,905 --> 01:41:36,272
But dobbs was guilty.

1857
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:38,524
Dobbs needed to be
convicted,

1858
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:42,612
So the end
justifies the means.

1859
01:41:44,481 --> 01:41:46,299
Right?

1860
01:41:49,319 --> 01:41:51,170
I'm in no position
to judge.

1861
01:41:51,238 --> 01:41:53,172
Why not?

1862
01:41:53,257 --> 01:41:56,008
There are 2 kinds of people
who live in alaska.

1863
01:41:56,093 --> 01:41:57,993
The ones
who are born here,

1864
01:41:58,045 --> 01:42:02,515
And the ones who come here
to escape something else.

1865
01:42:02,599 --> 01:42:04,300
I wasn't born here.

1866
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:08,137
Well, why don't you
tell me what you think?

1867
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:10,690
Here, now, in this room,

1868
01:42:10,774 --> 01:42:13,276
You and me.

1869
01:42:13,343 --> 01:42:14,894
Please.

1870
01:42:18,615 --> 01:42:19,849
I guess it's about
what you thought

1871
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:22,401
Was right at the time.

1872
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:27,456
And what you're willing
to live with.

Uh, she's not here
right now.

20 minutes ago to go--

Detective burr.

1881
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:43,876
Are they friendly?

1882
01:44:43,961 --> 01:44:46,679
Oh, yeah. Didn't expect
to see you this soon.

1883
01:44:46,747 --> 01:44:48,130
Sorry about the mess,

1884
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:49,164
Just doing
a little work here.

1885
01:44:49,216 --> 01:44:50,349
Oh, no problem.

1886
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:04,180
Do you think
kay's letters

1887
01:45:04,247 --> 01:45:06,849
Could really strengthen
the case against randy?

1888
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,517
Possibly.

I've done it
a thousand times.

1894
01:45:49,609 --> 01:45:52,061
Sorry about
all the clutter.

I am a pack rat.

1896
01:45:54,664 --> 01:45:58,084
I keep everything.

1897
01:45:58,168 --> 01:46:00,786
I know I got 'em.
I just don't know where.

1898
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:04,907
They gotta be here
somewhere.

1899

Working on a new
book, mr. Finch?

1900
01:46:06,576 --> 01:46:07,626
Have you read
any of my books?

Where is she?

She knows
you killed hap.

1906

You would've
realized it yourself

1907
01:46:56,176 --> 01:46:58,144
If you weren't
so fucking strung out.

1908
01:46:58,228 --> 01:46:59,645
I saw it
at the questioning.

1909
01:46:59,713 --> 01:47:00,629
The way she was
looking at you.

Where is she, finch?

Calm down, now I got
everything under control.

1912

If anything
happened to her--

She's ok. But if we
don't do something

it's all fine.

Let's search
this place.

What are
we looking for?

For the dress.
What dress?

Ellie's.

We're in the same boat.

01:48:27,517 --> 01:48:29,852
Did you mean
to shoot hap?

1940
01:48:30,904 --> 01:48:34,523
I...I don't know
anymore.

1941
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:37,826
I, uh, I don't know.

1942
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:41,580
I couldn't see him
through the fog,

1943
01:48:41,665 --> 01:48:43,449
But when
I got up close,

1944
01:48:43,533 --> 01:48:46,619
He was, uh...

1945
01:48:46,703 --> 01:48:48,570
He was afraid of me.

1946
01:48:48,622 --> 01:48:51,340
And he thought
I meant to do it,

1947
01:48:51,407 --> 01:48:54,543
So...Maybe I did.

1948
01:48:57,747 --> 01:49:00,799
I just don't know
anymore.

1949
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,270
[shotgun blast]

1950
01:49:16,533 --> 01:49:18,033
Where's your gun?
He took it.

1951
01:49:22,522 --> 01:49:24,573
Keep your head down.

1952
01:49:24,624 --> 01:49:26,125
All right, now listen.

1953
01:49:26,209 --> 01:49:27,626
I got 7 rounds
in this clip.

1954
01:49:27,694 --> 01:49:28,744
Ok.
Make it last.

1955
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:30,663
Head down.

1956
01:49:34,334 --> 01:49:36,552
Ok, go, go!

1957
01:49:54,321 --> 01:49:55,821
[gunshot]

1958
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:34,860
You forgot
the wild card, will.

1959
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:51,720
Ellie:
Detective dormer!

1960
01:51:54,808 --> 01:51:56,925
I called for backup.
They'll be here soon.

1961
01:51:56,976 --> 01:52:00,429
Dormer...Just hold on.

1962
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,614
Hold on.

1963
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:13,826
Nobody needs to know.

1964
01:52:17,497 --> 01:52:18,497
You didn't
mean to do it,

1965
01:52:18,581 --> 01:52:21,500
And I know that
even if you don't.

1966
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:23,552
No, don't, don't.

1967
01:52:23,619 --> 01:52:25,671
What?

1968
01:52:27,006 --> 01:52:28,657
Why?

1969
01:52:30,477 --> 01:52:33,929
Don't lose your way.

1970
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:40,486
Hang on.

1971
01:52:42,689 --> 01:52:44,490
Dormer.

1972
01:52:45,641 --> 01:52:47,326
Let me sleep.

1973
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:49,945
No.

1974
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:52,664
Just let me sleep.
