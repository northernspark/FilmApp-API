2
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:29,132
That man's crazy.

3
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:12,195
This is terrible.

4
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:15,807
Take Dr Bruckner to intensive care
immediately.

5
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:24,950
7 years later

6
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:05,240
As long as she finds me attractive.

7
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:12,482
And now, doctor...

8
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,238
Yuck, what a face.

9
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:20,904
That's Professor Bruckner. He's been
in a coma for 7 years.

10
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:24,547
He used to be a surgeon.

11
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:28,201
I feel sorry for him.
-Sorry? He's a creep.

12
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,574
Good evening.
-Good evening.

13
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,755
Did you look at the records?
-Yes, I'm almost finished.

14
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,611
This is Bert, the new assistant.
And this is Kim.

15
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,570
A glass of wine. You?

16
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:04,963
It's a bit scary to do my rounds
for the first time.

17
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:07,410
Do you really have to go?
-I have a date.

18
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,093
Have you done Coma yet?

19
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,396
No, do I have to?

20
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:17,069
I thought we might do it together.

21
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:19,614
Sorry, I have to make a phone call.

22
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:37,488
Peter speaking. Is Amy there?

23
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:41,785
I'll wait.

24
00:11:56,056 --> 00:12:01,103
Finally, were you having a bath?
-Hi, Peter.

25
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:03,115
I haven't heard from you for
a while.

26
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,987
How are you?

27
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:07,524
I wanted to discuss that with you
tonight.

28
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:10,652
That's impossible.

29
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:13,522
I already have a date.
-Cancel it.

30
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:16,702
Duh.
-Are you going to a party?

31
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:20,304
No, he's coming to me.

32
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:24,065
Not that asshole with the leather
jacket?

33
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:27,173
Or are you into SM these days?
-That's enough.

34
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:33,041
Anything else?
-Let me know if you want a trio.

35
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,630
What about that?

36
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:42,152
Wasn't I doing your shift?
-What time is it?

37
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:44,555
Almost 8:30 pm.
-Damn.

38
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,167
Where's Kim?
-Isn't she back yet?

39
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,862
No.

40
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:56,376
Darling, I'll call you back later.
Bye.

41
00:12:57,595 --> 00:13:00,437
She'll be pissed off.

42
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:16,257
What took you so long?

43
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,478
We already called the hospital.

44
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,986
Have you been drinking?
-Come on, mum.

45
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,875
I smell alcohol.
-Why are you so late?

46
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:27,111
The girl who was doing my shift
was gone.

47
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,112
Call Hank and Shirley.

48
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,911
Nice little car.

49
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,112
How do I look?

50
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:43,672
Good, you should wear a tuxedo
more often.

51
00:14:43,673 --> 00:14:50,259
Not bad.
-Behave, you're a guest here.

52
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:53,717
Bobby will keep an eye on you.

53
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:56,022
Why aren't you going anywhere?

54
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:58,828
You know I have an early start
tomorrow.

55
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,046
Amy's home alone too.
-She already has a boyfriend.

56
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:04,377
The one with the motor bike?
-Yes.

57
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:07,396
You can't take him seriously.
-Do you take Peter seriously?

58
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:11,146
Go now.

59
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:17,147
Have fun.

60
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:21,373
Hello.
-Hello.

61
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:24,557
Sorry, we had to wait for Peter.
He had a late shift.

62
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:29,500
If our car hadn't been in the garage,
we could have given you a lift.

63
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:33,529
Have your parents left, Ted?
-No, they'll be a bit later.

64
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,424
Ask your mother to bring my Tupperware
containers. I need them.

65
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:39,891
Call Peter.
-Why?

66
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:43,130
Just do it.
-What's wrong?

67
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:47,787
I haven't had this car for half
a year yet.

68
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:50,442
It looks like it's been cut with
a knife.

69
00:15:51,394 --> 00:15:54,311
What's wrong now?

70
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,941
Come here.

71
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,614
What's wrong?
-Come here, Peter.

72
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,851
Do you have to do that now?
-Stay out of it.

73
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,750
You said you'd be careful with
my car.

74
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:11,703
Did you do that?

75
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:14,775
It was like that already.

76
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,350
You're not saying I did this with
a knife, are you?

77
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:20,507
Don't ask me.

78
00:16:21,024 --> 00:16:24,126
Can you continue this conversation
tomorrow?

79
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:27,168
It's already 9 pm.
-Let's go.

80
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,997
Bye.
-Bye.

81
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:52,246
Aren't you going to the party?
-No, mum, I'm staying with Amy.

82
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:57,061
Ok, careful with the fireworks.
-Of course.

83
00:17:57,161 --> 00:18:00,991
Oh and Mrs Bogaerd needs her
Tupperware containers.

84
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:05,165
I'll have to try and find them and we're
late as it is.

85
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,033
John, did you...

86
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,083
Hey, Dennis.

87
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:08,581
Get lost, Dennis!

88
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:02,800
Amy, will you bring the firewood?

89
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,859
I thought you'd do that.
-But I'm fixing your walkman.

90
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:07,718
Ok.

91
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:22,675
Ted?

92
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:50,943
Stop it!

93
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:55,718
How did you get in?
-Your backdoor was open.

94
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,737
That doesn't mean you can come in.

95
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,353
You're so hard.

96
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,378
What do you want?
-Isn't it clear?

97
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:20,864
Mum!

98
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:51,024
I'll explain one more time.

99
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:56,657
Ted called me two weeks ago.
He wanted us to have a drink together.

100
00:26:57,541 --> 00:27:00,601
I said yes and it was very nice.

101
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:02,032
So it's been going on for a while.

102
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:06,344
Amy, that's not what we agreed.
-Agreed?

103
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:10,109
You've been doing the same thing.
I don't care.

104
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:13,105
You're seeing that nurse... Kim or
something.

105
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:15,296
You're jealous.

106
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:18,004
Jealousy doesn't have anything
to do with it.

107
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:21,015
No, it's got nothing to do with it.

108
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,561
You'd better leave.

109
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:04,011
Why?
-It's not working between us.

110
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:07,439
We've known each other since we were 12.
-It has always worked.

111
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:12,494
Until that asshole moved here.
-That's when I noticed the difference.

112
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:15,606
What?

113
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,745
If you like mummy's boys in leather,
that's your problem.

114
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:24,746
See you.

115
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,130
She's all yours again. I'm done.

116
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:51,059
Good.

117
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:56,917
What's that? Is that the best
you could find?

118
00:28:57,017 --> 00:28:59,653
You can't buy her with this.

119
00:28:59,753 --> 00:29:05,067
Bastard, why do you treat me like this?
I can't help that she likes me, not you.

120
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:08,753
She doesn't want you. You just
keep calling her.

121
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,950
She called me, I swear.

122
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:17,303
Stop lying.

123
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:19,570
Let me go. I want to see her.
-No.

124
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,496
I changed my mind. I'm going back
to her.

125
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:27,337
Bye, Teddy.

126
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:00,323
Have a seat.

127
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,221
These things have become so small.
It's very finicky.

128
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:12,843
They want you to buy a new one,
instead of fixing it.

129
00:30:13,423 --> 00:30:14,863
You're very good at that.

130
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:19,626
I bet you want to talk about Amy.
-Why?

131
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:22,343
They all want that.
-They who?

132
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,803
I'm popular with those guys.
-Which guys?

133
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:31,219
From school and the football club.
She had a lot of dates lately.

134
00:30:31,313 --> 00:30:33,685
The guys like her.

135
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:38,896
So Ted and her aren't going steady yet?
-In his dreams.

136
00:30:38,996 --> 00:30:40,845
My father hates him.

137
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:44,609
Shall we play a bit? Where's
your sax?

138
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,611
Downstairs.

139
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:51,024
I think she likes you.

140
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:53,193
Really?

141
00:30:57,757 --> 00:31:00,125
At least, I hope so.

142
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,810
Amy!

143
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,350
Amy!

144
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:29,290
I heard you've been seeing the
entire football team.

145
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,405
Yes and we had a great time.

146
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:32,406
Why are you here?

147
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,971
Why do you think?

148
00:31:38,424 --> 00:31:47,661
We went to school together, grew up
together. You're like a brother to me.

149
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:50,656
No more and no less.

150
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,436
So I'm your brother?

151
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,889
Asshole!

152
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:23,540
Hey.
-I have one more problem.

153
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,687
What's that?

154
00:34:25,785 --> 00:34:29,648
Ted. I'm sure he'll be here soon.

155
00:34:30,553 --> 00:34:35,300
That's no longer a problem.
-Why?

156
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:44,184
I saw him outside just now.
He won't bother you again.

157
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:47,257
What do you mean? I decide who
I see.

158
00:34:47,357 --> 00:34:51,725
Stop worrying about that loser.

159
00:34:51,825 --> 00:34:52,726
Stop it.

160
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:57,878
It's up to you. Damnit.

161
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:59,898
I'm fed up.

162
00:35:33,302 --> 00:35:36,062
Bob!
-Yes.

163
00:35:36,162 --> 00:35:40,562
Will you play the piano?
-Has Peter left yet?

164
00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:42,862
He just left.

165
00:35:42,962 --> 00:35:45,259
I'm coming.

166
00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:27,929
Tonight wasn't a party for everybody.

167
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:31,594
Three victims were reported at
St Anna Hospital.

168
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:34,146
It was described as a terrible massacre.

169
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:37,709
We're going there live.

170
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:44,687
Well-known American Professor Bruckner,
who went into a coma 7 years ago...

171
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:51,458
after a car accident, with bad burns,
has disappeared from the hospital.

172
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:54,603
The murders were committed around
the same time.

173
00:38:54,703 --> 00:38:58,314
The police haven't found a trace of the
killer yet, but what can you tell us?

174
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:06,548
We're checking all the staff who've
been working tonight.

175
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:11,953
We don't have any solid leads yet.

176
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:15,405
Thank you. Back to the stu...

177
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:52,660
Dennis.

178
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,501
American Professor Bruckner has
a reputation in the medical world.

179
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:56,363
Eight years ago, he made the news with
a controversial experiment.

180
00:40:56,839 --> 00:40:59,651
Have a look at some archive
footage.

181
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,225
The Minister refused permission, deeming
the experiments a public health risk.

182
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:39,320
I'm now talking to Dr Horvath.

183
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,950
He's one of Professor Bruckner's
colleagues.

184
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:50,338
Could the experiment have been done
with Professor Bruckner himself?

185
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:53,459
That's absolutely impossible.

186
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:59,346
Then how do you explain he came out of
his coma and can walk apparently?

187
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:03,286
That has never happened before,
as far as we know.

188
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:09,594
I don't have an explanation either.

189
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:15,610
We simply don't know enough about
the human brain yet.

190
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,859
Can many years of coma corrupt
one's mind?

191
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:27,283
That's a fact. The longer the coma,
the worse the brain damage.

192
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:34,285
Professor Bruckner is proof of this.

193
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:41,039
It's a case of life imitating art.

194
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:45,711
Professor Bruckner was a kind of
Frankenstein.

195
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:50,631
But he became the monster of his own
experiments.

196
00:42:50,731 --> 00:42:54,121
So you admit experiments have been done
with Professor Bruckner.

197
00:42:54,221 --> 00:42:57,312
Was it a brain operation or
an experiment with medication?

198
00:44:02,112 --> 00:44:07,152
Number 8. Looking all quiet.

199
00:44:27,176 --> 00:44:29,343
This has to be it. Number 6.

200
00:44:29,443 --> 00:44:32,427
He must be the last one to have seen
the killer.

201
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:36,085
Such nonsense. I've never had such
a boring New Year's Eve.

202
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:38,695
We're talking about a murder
case here.

203
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:45,248
Come back quickly and ask if the
champagne's cold.

204
00:47:49,963 --> 00:47:52,508
Do you know if Peter has gone home?
-Yes, why?

205
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:57,513
Are you sure he went home?
-Yes, I think so.

206
00:47:58,195 --> 00:47:59,653
Why?

207
00:47:59,982 --> 00:48:01,974
I keep calling him but he doesn't
answer.

208
00:48:02,074 --> 00:48:05,024
He must be asleep.

209
00:49:26,304 --> 00:49:28,731
Amy!
-Yes!

210
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,839
Come here.
-Ok.

211
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,573
Listen to this.

212
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:41,276
After the gruesome murders in
St Anna Hospital earlier tonight...

213
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:44,580
the police are telling people in
the area to be careful...

214
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,577
and to stay home.

215
00:49:48,421 --> 00:49:51,186
Put a tape in it. Sit down.

216
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:02,157
It's great!

217
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:06,615
Well done.

218
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:11,015
Keep it for a while. It also belongs
to you now.

219
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:14,421
Thanks. Are you going to see Peter?
-Yes, but I won't be long.

220
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:19,094
See you soon.

221
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,327
Oh good.

222
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:05,445
Peter, where are you? It's me, Amy.

223
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:17,867
Peter.

224
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:28,208
Are you in there?

225
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:52,024
Dennis, you scared me.

226
00:52:56,399 --> 00:52:58,477
Come on!

227
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:17,610
Jesus, Bobby!

228
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:11,803
Bobby, hurry, please.

229
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,882
Damnit, Bobby, answer the phone.

230
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,659
Amy, watch out!
-Bobby!

231
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:19,452
Get up!

232
01:01:20,325 --> 01:01:22,553
Come.

233
01:01:22,653 --> 01:01:25,392
I don't know where your room key is.

234
01:01:59,807 --> 01:02:01,988
Now what?

235
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,535
No, much bigger.

236
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:21,841
Hurry up, Bob.

237
01:02:33,158 --> 01:02:35,119
Come on.

238
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,927
Quick!

239
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:03,338
Come on, Bobby.

240
01:03:08,686 --> 01:03:11,422
Go, Amy

241
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:34,995
There's no plug on it.

242
01:04:54,209 --> 01:04:57,816
Peter... it's Peter.

243
01:05:07,287 --> 01:05:09,870
Amy, watch out!

244
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,857
Peter, I thought you were dead.

245
01:05:57,773 --> 01:06:00,211
Peter.
-Where did he go?

246
01:06:03,757 --> 01:06:05,926
Shall I get you a band-aid?

247
01:06:11,954 --> 01:06:14,838
Gee...

248
01:06:29,929 --> 01:06:32,534
Is this better?
-Yes.

249
01:06:39,566 --> 01:06:42,149
Bob, get some band-aids.

250
01:07:18,146 --> 01:07:20,657
He's got Bobby. We have to go
after him.

251
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:25,014
I'll go after him and you stay here
in case Bobby comes back.

252
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:50,047
Bruckner!

253
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:57,176
