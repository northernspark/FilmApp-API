Anybody home?

3
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,313
Just us mice.

4
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,158
Is there something we couId drink
that wiII make us two inches taII?

5
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,832
- Then we couId move in.
- This fenestration here.

6
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,153
- The what?
- The windows.

7
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,399
See the windows on the west waII?
It doesn't quite work.

8
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,720
Vincent, it's the most beautifuI
I've ever seen.

9
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,554
Come over here.

10
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,395
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you.

11
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,478
What was your name again?

12
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,710
I do Iove you.

13
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,478
Go, go, go, go, go!

14
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,349
I don't want to miss it!
PIease, pIease, don't Iet me miss it.

15
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,230
The contractor said
that tomorrow morning wouId be good.

16
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,389
We can finaIIy get things started.
Can you get away for a few hours?

17
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,756
What's tomorrow?. Wednesday, right?

18
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,916
- Yeah. Yeah, we can do that.
- Great.

19
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,557
I'II get the car this afternoon
so we get started earIy.

20
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,399
- What?
- Why do you do that?

21
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,354
- What do you mean?
- Why do you Ieave it at her pIace?

22
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,234
- Because I don't need it in town.
- Why not at my pIace?

23
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,112
Because your car is there.

24
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,272
It's convenient. There's a garage.
PIease stop doing this.

25
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,234
You don't Iive with her any more,
but your car stiII does.

26
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,036
What eIse do you Ieave there?
A toothbrush? A pair of sIippers?

27
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,874
A daughter.

28
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,118
Taxi!

29
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,996
Taxi, hoId on a second.

30
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,159
It's not nice for her not knowing
if you've Ieft or are coming back.

31
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,113
I'm not going back.
Why are you doing this?

32
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,311
I want to know where you Iive.

33
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,396
I Iive with you.

34
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,710
I Iove you.

35
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,156
With aII those bridges,
you shouIdn't be afraid to burn one.

36
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,034
Norman, I Iove the eIevations.
I Iove them. A Iot, a Iot!

37
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,472
Second thoughts?

38
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,949
- I don't Iike the spacing of the coIumns.
- Is he starting again?

39
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,280
NeaI, come here. Come here, Iook
at this. What does it remind you of?

40
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,836
- My grandfather's radiator.
- OnIy a bird sees it from there.

41
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,031
- I see it.
- SaIIy, teII him.

42
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,631
- It's fabuIous. Don't worry.
- Some act you two have.

43
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,549
A briIIiant buiIding. Frank LIoyd Wright
is eating his heart out.

44
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,709
PIease sign off these specs for the
TenIy project. They're going crazy.

45
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,760
Oh, it's beautifuI.

46
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,550
- You don't have to say that.
- I know.

47
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,637
The Antonio House is encIosed. PIumbing
and eIectric are finished on the 10th.

48
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,960
''ArchitecturaI Digest'' wants
a photo session the week of the 15th.

49
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,076
Drive down the day before.
Gerry FairchiId wants to dine with you.

50
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,919
The oId guy?. How did you swing that?

51
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,193
I had Dad caII him.
They went to schooI together.

52
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,272
You.

53
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,598
- You reaIIy are something.
- How's that?

54
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,678
You just keep right in there swinging
away...just Iike nothing's ever changed.

55
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,556
I'm protecting my investment. Can you
pick up Meaghan from baIIet schooI?

56
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,639
- Today?.
- Yeah. I have that fund-raiser.

57
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,118
- I can trade you something next week.
- That's aII right. I'II do that.

58
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,598
I have to pick up the car today.
I'II have NeaI give me a ride.

59
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,917
- OK.
- Do we have anything earIy tomorrow?.

60
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,514
- No. Going somewhere?
- No, I...just had something to see.

61
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,191
- It's the museum thing in the afternoon.
- I'II be there by three.

62
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,073
- AII right.
- Hey! That's nice.

63
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,115
The sweater. It's a nice coIour on you.
I Iike it.

64
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,875
Don't do that.

65
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,354
Hey, girI, they're waiting for you,
as usuaI. Don't forget to caII your mom.

66
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,157
Business. Environment. AstroIogy.
Everybody OK?.

67
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,557
- Wait. Where's OIivia?
- Who's OIivia?

68
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,275
- Try the vaIet parking.
- You're Iate.

69
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,754
Sorry.

70
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,715
- You couId have faxed it in.
- I Iike to commute.

71
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,876
- How many words?
- 750.

72
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,629
'Women Who Demand EquaIity
Renounce Their Superiority.''

73
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,595
- Norman MaiIer wiII send a death threat.
- WouIdn't that be great?

74
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,830
- I'm not sure how the epiIogue fits in.
- What epiIogue?

75
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,718
- So that's why you turned me down.
- CharIie, you couIdn't handIe it.

76
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,469
- Try me.
- You sound Iike an ad for phone sex.

77
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,638
What does 'V' stand for?.

78
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,398
- When's Meaghan's spring vacation?
- The first two weeks of ApriI.

79
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,558
Are you going right out to the isIand?

80
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,992
I won't be abIe to make it.
I'II be in the middIe of some project.

81
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,237
Have you spoken to Meaghan
about this?

82
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,389
- I'II spend time with her before you go.
- WeII, that'II work wonders.

83
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,119
We've got a probIem
at the TenIy construction site.

84
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,119
- No parking, no Iease!
- Why did you hire me for the job?

85
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,115
- We Iiked the design.
- Then stay with it! This is insane!

86
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,232
I need that parking space
to sign the Iease.

87
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,558
- What is this crap?
- It's a minor probIem. Eastman, Iisten.

88
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,877
- Read your contract!
- What?

89
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,640
Our attorney assures us
we have the right...

90
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,879
- Fuck my contract. Fuck you!
- We can push back.

91
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,390
Is this a threat?
Is this man threatening me?

92
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,795
- No, he didn't...
- To heII with you!

93
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,231
Then bring your goddamn goombah
Iawyers out of the woodwork!

94
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,793
Where's a phone?

95
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,356
You'II get your parking space.
Give it a day.

96
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,198
The man is crazy!

97
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,156
Very nice. Very dipIomatic.

98
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,559
Come on, NeaI. They don't need that
shit. They just want to be cute.

99
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,719
- They're the cIients.
- Great men of vision.

100
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,994
Everybody has to work for somebody.
MicheIangeIo had to pIease the Pope.

101
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,760
The Pope didn't ask for parking space.

102
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,396
They're not bad guys.
They want a coupIe of changes.

103
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,830
Why take it out on them?

104
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,389
What? NeaI, taking what out?

105
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,956
NeaI, teII me. Do you have something
to say?. Do you have a probIem?

106
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,591
- No, you do.
- Which is?

107
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,956
What?

108
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,635
You have an apartment in town,
a daughter in the house,

109
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,877
SaIIy in the office,
a girIfriend somewhere eIse...

110
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,389
Her name is OIivia.

111
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,230
It's bad design. You're supposed
to have everything under one roof.

112
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,478
Architecture 101 .

113
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,119
I aIways Ioved this house.

114
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,556
Perfect house for the perfect coupIe.

115
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,596
It wasn't so perfect. See you tomorrow.

116
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,998
What you have now is perfect?
You had a famiIy.

117
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,630
We weren't a famiIy.

118
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,599
We were a corporation with a kid.

119
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,833
When the boys went off to coIIege,

120
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,192
CIaire and I were going to traveI
the worId, see aII the museums.

121
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,039
The Prado, Paris, FIorence, India even.

122
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,956
There was a Piero deIIa Francesca
in a church in Arezzo.

123
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,118
The most beautifuI thing in the worId.

124
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,153
I wanted to show it to her.

125
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,313
We kept saying ''next year''.

126
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,320
Tempus fugit, paI.
Whatever you're going to do, do it!

127
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,396
HeIIo?

128
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,036
Edwina?

129
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,196
HeIIo?

130
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,316
Meaghan?

131
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,674
HeIIo? Anybody here?

132
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,838
HeIIo?

133
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,711
Vincent, couId you hand me
my robe, pIease?

134
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,116
Thank you.

135
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,110
I think Predock's going to get
that Santa Fe thing.

136
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,676
Predock?. He's good.
He'II do a good job.

137
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,599
Not as good as you.

138
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,239
There's enough to go around.

139
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,996
Don't forget we have that thing
tomorrow night.

140
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,476
What? Oh, shit! That formaI thing.

141
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,674
- I don't want to go.
- You must. Mom and Dad wiII be there.

142
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,994
- Do you know you're a knockout?
- You mean ''stiII''?

143
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,797
- I mean you're a knockout.
- So are you.

144
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,316
Why don't you shave?

145
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,154
- ReaIIy?.
- ReaIIy.

146
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,639
- Did you check on Meaghan?
- Yeah, she's asIeep.

147
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,312
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Come on.

148
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,955
- Honey...it's probabIy...
- We have an answering machine.

149
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,798
Honey, it's probabIy RusseII.

150
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,710
He'II Ieave a message. He'II Ieave a
nice, Iong message. Don't, don't, don't.

151
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,990
Come on, honey.

152
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,148
SaIIy Eastman.

153
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,430
RusseII!

154
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,358
No, we were just taIking.

155
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,509
We were taIking about what a IoveIy
time we had at dinner with you.

156
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,758
You're kidding!
They want to buiId the house.

157
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,910
- Mr Eastman? Is something wrong?
- Edwina. No.

158
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,748
- Where's Meaghan?
- BaIIet cIass. Aren't you fetching her?.

159
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,315
Oh, God, yes!

160
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,676
Lift up, pIease.

161
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,750
PuII up.

162
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,556
Watch your music.

163
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,716
Long arm.

164
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,194
There we go. Long in the arm.

165
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,392
That's my dad!

166
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,239
And a very nice tight fifth.

167
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,069
We aII get on stage,
in front of this director guy.

168
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,353
He's watching aII of us.
He picks one girI to do a soIo.

169
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,596
One, for the reaI opera?

170
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,438
''The RosenkavaIier''
or ''The Magic FIute''.

171
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,355
And Mrs Krask kind of impIied
it's between me and Chrissy TayIor.

172
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,916
I can't beIieve this! That's incredibIe.

173
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,078
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

174
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,628
- Go on, finish your sandwich.
- No, that's OK. I'm not hungry.

175
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,116
- Go on.
- I had a big Iunch.

176
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,754
You had a big Iunch? What?

177
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,276
An appIe.

178
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,711
- You know what Dr Lemert said.
- Dancers have to stay skinny.

179
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,151
If you don't watch out you'II be a fainter,
not a dancer.

180
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,559
- I'II have to carry you off stage.
- That's not true!

181
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,799
Richard says I have a good chance
of getting picked for the corps de baIIet.

182
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,356
- Who's Richard?
- Richard Quarry, a friend of Mom's.

183
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,678
- He makes Iots of money for the opera.
- ReaIIy?.

184
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,279
Is he nice?

185
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,990
He's OK. But he makes pancakes
in the shape of animaIs for breakfast.

186
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,636
It's Iike... Give me a break.

187
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,554
For breakfast?

188
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,231
Uh-oh.

189
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,715
Breakfast?

190
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,913
- Sounds pretty serious.
- I don't know. I mean...

191
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,677
She's taIking about inviting him
to the isIand for Easter.

192
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,196
How's the house coming?

193
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,233
- Which one?
- You and OIivia.

194
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,876
- That house. It'II start soon.
- My room?

195
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,516
- You have a room in this house?
- I hope so.

196
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,554
You've got big windows.
From them you see the ocean.

197
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,232
You've got doIphins and whaIes, just
Iike I said. You're so pretty. Let's go.

198
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,673
OK.

199
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,068
- Dad?
- Yeah?

200
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,916
- WiII you come to the isIand for Easter?.
- Get in. We'II taIk about it.

201
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,672
Honey! Honey!

202
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,192
We have tadpoIes, we have frogs,
we have fish.

203
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,278
Oysters! Look at this!

204
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,429
Let's put a fIower garden outside the
bedroom window. Roses! CameIIias!

205
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,519
No! WiIdfIowers.
We'II put wiIdfIowers everywhere!

206
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,235
The summer nights. Oh, my God!

207
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,718
Hey! Over here!

208
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,869
- Hey.
- Hi.

209
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,237
- How do you Iike your view?.
- Great. When can you start?

210
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,753
- I think I can start Monday.
- I don't know. With aII these rains.

211
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,797
I don't want to pour a foundation and
get rain damage before it's encIosed.

212
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,916
- What do you think?.
- Yeah, that's probabIy wise.

213
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,593
- I'd best be going.
- I'II be in touch with you.

214
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,117
- Thanks for coming.
- Nice meeting you.

215
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,959
Pappas is a good man. One of the best.

216
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,518
You don't want this house.

217
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,198
What makes you say that?

218
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,953
- No rush.
- This isn't as easy as you think.

219
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,393
There are high winds here. It's rainy this
time of the year. It's not an easy site...

220
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,434
You buiId office towers and museums.
This is a IittIe house.

221
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,474
WeII, I'm actuaIIy going to Iive
in this IittIe house.

222
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,876
Come here.

223
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,919
I want it to be right. ReaIIy right.

224
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,920
- We have aII the time in the worId.
- You said we'd get started by Easter.

225
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,598
That's not going to happen anyway.

226
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,436
I've got to go to the isIand.

227
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,915
Meaghan asked me.

228
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,396
This is a very difficuIt time for her.
She needs her father.

229
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,793
You wanted to see me?

230
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,880
Yeah. I'd Iike to come out to the isIand
for Easter, if that's OK.

231
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,589
- What happened?
- I thought about it. I'd Iike to be there.

232
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,113
That is, if it doesn't interfere
with anything.

233
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,520
- What do you mean?
- PIans of yours.

234
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,631
- No. It's great. Meaghan wiII be thriIIed.
- Good.

235
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,513
So, Richard, huh?

236
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,038
- Who?
- Richard!

237
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,755
Pancakes in the shape of animaIs.
Richard, you know.

238
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,997
- He's a friend of the famiIy.
- Does she eat them?

239
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,998
- Not usuaIIy.
- Good. GIad to hear that.

240
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,158
Have we concIuded the interrogation?

241
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,549
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, aII right?

242
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,231
She bIurted it out
and I didn't take it very weII. It threw me.

243
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,630
I shouId have toId you.

244
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,070
I'm sorry.

245
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,754
What?

246
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,516
You know what NeaI asked,
out of the bIue?

247
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,999
He asked me what happened to us.
I couIdn't remember.

248
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,954
- You feII in Iove with another woman.
- Before that.

249
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,799
Look, we don't have to do
this Easter thing, you and me.

250
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,075
That's aII right. There's stiII that
shutter that rattIes in the wind.

251
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,035
- The guest room. I didn't fix that.
- You'd better. It'II be your room.

252
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,114
- Is it your sinuses?
- Yeah.

253
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,629
- You Iook terribIe.
- Thanks.

254
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,513
You probabIy have a fever.

255
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,314
SaIIy, I'm aII right.

256
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,915
You need a siesta.

257
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,759
You stiII have that hoteI room?

258
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,035
Where was that?

259
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,150
It was...Denman Street.

260
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,428
Is it nice?

261
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,428
- It's a hoteI room.
- HoteI rooms can be nice.

262
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,277
No past. No future.

263
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,911
Just impersonaI.

264
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,037
What's a girI have to do
to get a IittIe action around here?

265
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,838
Oh! Where did that come from?

266
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,117
That is not Iike me, is it?

267
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,673
You have a ride tonight to the museum?

268
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,838
No thanks. I have a Iift.

269
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,076
- Pancake man?
- Yeah.

270
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,636
- Does he wear an apron?
- You used to be funnier.

271
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,070
- I'II hire a writer.
- This isn't such a good idea.

272
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,116
I don't think that we can come here
every day to the same office.

273
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,631
You're right. You're fired.

274
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,917
That's better.

275
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,119
It's my turn, my turn!

276
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,515
I'II teII you the truth.

277
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,157
When she first showed up with him,
I was not convinced.

278
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,958
Far from it.
An art student? God heIp us.

279
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,392
But she worked with him and
she straightened him out.

280
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,751
Our daughter has never Iooked better!

281
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,992
She Iooks so beautifuI.

282
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,753
So, now aII I want to know is,
where are my grandchiIdren?

283
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,350
- Dad.
- You've had a year. Let's get moving.

284
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,630
I'm exhausted.

285
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,957
SettIe down. This is not a roast.

286
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,315
We're proud of you.
And we Iove you both.

287
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,910
Long Iife!

288
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,473
Long Iife!

289
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,636
I Iove you, Daddy.

290
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,109
Demonstrators in Tehran shouted ''Down
with America'' and ''Death to Carter'',

291
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,348
The actions of Iranian Ieaders and
the radicaIs were compIeteIy unjustified,

292
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,274
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be mingIing.

293
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,429
- I think I'm mingIed out.
- It doesn't matter. You're a hit.

294
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,589
- TeII me. I'm Iistening.
- Of course you're the most fabuIous.

295
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,758
- And you can be so charming.
- Of course.

296
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,350
And you're incredibIy funny.

297
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,916
- Very taIented.
- Yes.

298
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,069
- I didn't hear ''sexuaIIy irresistibIe''.
- My grandmother said that.

299
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,031
The Raynors want you to buiId
a new summer cottage for them.

300
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,993
- ReaIIy?.
- Isn't that nice?

301
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,156
Yeah, it's good.

302
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,638
RandaII Otis wants to redo
his executive offices.

303
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,195
God, that's wonderfuI.

304
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,358
And, I'm not sure, but I think...

305
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,757
I think we have Iunch
with Brian Kennedy.

306
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,916
- Who?
- From the university.

307
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:46,036
- He is the construction committee!
- You're a genius.

308
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,196
Great.

309
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,077
- No, don't. No.
- Yes.

310
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,078
Vincent. Honey.

311
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,558
Come on. There are peopIe downstairs.

312
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,479
You go and Iock that door.

313
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,639
He said he wanted grandchiIdren!
Listen to your father.

314
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,958
Vincent...
God! I don't think he meant tonight.

315
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,518
But you be quiet, OK?.

316
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,110
I mean it. My parents are downstairs.

317
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,068
I got it. I'II do it, I'II do it.

318
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,838
Don't get your fingers on my dress.

319
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,153
Come on.

320
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,640
Kiss me. Kiss me.

321
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,794
That's good. Come on, hurry up.

322
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,553
Come on.

323
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,914
OK, that's good. OK.

324
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,560
That's good. It's OK.

325
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,953
OK. OK.

326
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,039
- My grandmother's downstairs.
- Stay, stay.

327
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,309
OK. AII right, hurry up.

328
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,479
Look, I'm aII wrinkIed.

329
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,435
Come on down pretty fast, OK?.
They're waiting for you.

330
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,716
You sure are a handsome deviI.

331
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,878
I mean for an oId guy.

332
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,954
Maybe the house isn't such a good
idea. Maybe it's too soon for you.

333
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,119
For us.
Maybe it's a IittIe too compIicated.

334
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,956
I mean it. And it's OK.

335
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,754
Yes, it is OK.

336
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,709
- What time wiII you be home?
- Around midnight.

337
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,878
- So Iate?
- I've got that thing at the museum.

338
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,277
- What thing?
- The reception.

339
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,755
- Your museum?
- Yeah. I toId you.

340
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,916
I don't remember.

341
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,592
It's just a dumb thing for the trustees.
They parade me Iike a trained seaI.

342
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,756
- Want me to come?
- No.

343
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,909
I'II just run up there,
make an appearance and get out.

344
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,518
I wiII be back before midnight.

345
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,870
I Iove you.

346
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,194
You reaIIy want the house?

347
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,197
Yes.

348
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,679
What's a month? One month?

349
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,155
We've got years.

350
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,318
1 20 on the side, 130, 130 now, At 130,

It's against you, ma'am. 180? Yes.

She comes back. And 50? I have 225.

366
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,948
SoId! GentIeman on the side.

367
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,754
- Cash or charge?
- Charge.

368
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,512
Excuse me. I'm sorry. It's such
an unusuaI cIock. I couIdn't resist.

369
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,355
- I was just bidding you up.
- Bidding me up?

370
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,799
- You work for the auctioneer?.
- Yeah.

371
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,194
- Do you ever get stuck?.
- Never.

372
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,795
What if I hadn't come in?

373
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,912
The guy with the sun hat
wouId go to 350.

374
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,759
I think he was out at 1 70.

375
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,035
Oh. WeII...

376
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,749
- Sir?.
- Yeah.

377
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,952
It's a Congreve cIock, actuaIIy.

378
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,109
EngIish. Kind of rare bird around here.
You don't see very many.

379
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,719
Phone number.

380
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,879
Keeps terribIe time,
but it's a very beautifuI object.

381
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,718
There you go.
That's yours, this is mine.

382
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,598
Do you have a pIace on the isIand?

383
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,109
- No.
- I didn't think so.

384
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,278
- Why is that?
- You're so fair.

385
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,359
I try to be.
What did you say your name was?

386
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,516
Eastman, Vincent.

387
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,110
Goodbye, Mr Eastman.
Enjoy your cIock.

388
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,595
This way, ma'am.

389
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,875
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

390
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,077
I know this is annoying. Have we met?

391
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,238
- No.
- You are so famiIiar.

392
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,230
- I thought I was being rather aIoof.
- You are, you are.

393
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,389
You know my name now. I thought
maybe at Ieast I couId know yours.

394
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,195
OIivia Marshak.

395
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,476
OIivia Marshak. Are you the writer?.
''Step Magazine''? ReaIIy?.

396
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,800
I can't beIieve this! I knew I knew you.
Your picture is on top of the coIumn?

397
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,357
It's so nice meeting you. I have
an incredibIe visuaI memory.

398
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,518
- WouId you Iike to sit down?
- No, that's OK.

399
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,794
It's reaIIy terrific. The magazine comes
to the office. The younger staff Iike it.

400
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,309
The young peopIe? God bIess them.

401
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,268
Can I get you something from the bar?.

402
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,914
- Not yet.
- I'II come back.

403
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:01,593
I remember a great coIumn you did.
We were passing it around the office.

404
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,033
It was about how you're aIways invited
to dinners as the unattached femaIe.

405
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,598
And you wouId aIways say no.
You wouId rather have your soIitude.

406
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,394
What did you caII it?

407
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,160
''HeII is Other PeopIe.''

408
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,876
Very good.

409
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,911
Is it true?

410
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,115
WouId you rather be aIone?

411
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,594
It depends.

412
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,759
- Are you sorry I sat down here?
- Not yet.

413
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,039
How about you?

414
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,715
We stoIe their Iand,
we decimated their culture,

415
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,434
We offered them welfare in exchange,

416
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,950
We wanted to do a buiIding
that wouId ceIebrate,

417
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,951
that wouId reassure them, and us, too,
of the greatness of that cuIture.

418
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,478
When I started thinking
about this project,

419
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,275
and every project has its own approach,

420
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,952
I wanted to get into the minds of the
peopIe who Iived here. To try, anyhow.

421
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,029
To feeI their reIationship with nature.
This extraordinary feeIing of divinity

422
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,189
that they had with everything around
them. Nature as a divine church.

423
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,712
I'II teII you a secret,
if you promise not to teII anybody.

424
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:03,359
I think there's something eIse here
besides concrete, stone and steeI,

425
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,915
that's hoIding this pIace up.

426
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,277
Anyhow, it's here. It's done.
We're very proud of this.

427
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,439
PIease waIk around and enjoy.
You paid for it.

428
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,598
But don't touch anything!

429
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,151
- It's beautifuI.
- That's reaI articuIate.

430
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,875
- Vincent, it's a triumph!
- Thank you.

431
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,436
- You're very sweet. Thanks.
- Nice to see you.

432
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,074
I'd stiII rather draw something
than expIain it.

433
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,070
What was that cIass?
A term paper was due...

434
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,149
European History. You were going
to draw the entire French RevoIution.

435
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:57,399
- Me and DeIacroix!
- Great work, Vincent.

436
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,874
Thank you.

437
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,438
- What was the professor's name?
- Leudtke. Hans Leudtke.

438
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,231
He had a terribIe toupee.
It was over his eyes.

439
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,676
- He had a thing for you.
- He did not.

440
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,919
- WonderfuI evening.
- Thank you. You remember ReginaId.

441
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,270
- Thanks a Iot.
- See you Wednesday.

442
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,109
Everyone taIked about it.
The guy was a mess.

443
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,997
He broke down when we got married.
PuIIed the rug right out from over him.

444
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,150
Come on, you're not Ieaving.

445
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,148
Pretty soon. I can't do this much Ionger.

446
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,079
Somebody wiII taIk to you.

447
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,033
You have to see Archer before you go.

448
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,676
Come on. PIease? For me?

449
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,229
- CongratuIations. MarveIIous buiIding.
- Thank you.

450
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,309
I wanted to caII you about something.
A new recitaI haII at the university.

451
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,957
- I think you'd be perfect for it.
- I don't think we've met.

452
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,069
Richard Quarry.

453
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,755
- The pancake man...
- Excuse me?

454
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,998
You make pancakes for my daughter.

455
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,635
Oh...yes.

456
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,594
I suppose I do.

457
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,237
She's a IoveIy girI.

458
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,716
What the heII do you know
about my daughter?.

459
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,433
- How did you get here?
- I fIew. There's an airport nearby.

460
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,598
I thought we couId drive home together.

461
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,349
- What's the matter?. They don't Iike it?
- They Iike it.

462
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,269
- It's beautifuI!
- Yes, it is. Let's get a drink.

463
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,715
- Yes, ma'am?
- Red wine.

464
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,354
- And for you, sir?.
- Nothing.

465
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,915
CIub soda.

466
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,798
Thank you.

467
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,432
What's the matter with you?

468
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,434
SaIIy is here. And Meaghan.

469
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,556
That's cosy.
Maybe we can aII go out for a pizza.

470
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,356
- You're drunk.
- It's the IittIe bottIes at the airport.

471
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,997
Are you trying to hide me?
If so, it's not going to work.

472
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:44,390
- If you'd onIy toId me. It's important...
- An important reception for the trustees.

473
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,832
Meaghan, a trustee?
So young, yet so accompIished.

474
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,349
- Let's go.
- Where?

475
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,953
- We're going home.
- No! I want to meet the trustees.

476
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,151
- Stop it.
- I've a better idea.

477
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,194
Do you have one of those
IittIe director's offices here?

478
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,072
Upstairs. Why?.

479
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,558
We couId Iock the door and do it
on the rug. A ceremoniaI quickie.

480
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,513
Grow up! For Christ's sake, grow up!

481
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,233
OK. I won't make a sound.
Just Iike SaIIy.

482
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,272
Go to heII.

483
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,837
- As soon as I know how I fit into aII this.
- Then come here.

484
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:33,153
Do you want to know how you fit in?
You don't! You do not fit into this.

485
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:39,230
I work with SaIIy. We did this project,
and we're very proud of this project.

486
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,389
It's not about you, it's about the
museum. Not everything is about you!

487
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,397
HeIIo.

488
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,316
I'm SaIIy Eastman.

489
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,320
SaIIy, this is OIivia Marshak.

490
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,752
- How are you?
- Fine.

491
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,596
I read your coIumn.

492
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,951
It's very good. It's very cIever.

493
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,549
- Thanks.
- I recognised you from your photo.

494
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,275
- You, too?
- Excuse me?

495
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,439
- It's a passport photo.
- ReaIIy?.

496
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,118
I Iike it.

497
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:34,952
''If you Iook Iike your passport photo,
you're not weII enough to traveI.''

498
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,074
- Hi, Meaghan.
- Hi.

499
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,394
WeII, it's nice to have
met you. At Iast.

500
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,637
Likewise.

501
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,756
Come on.

502
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,994
AII right?

503
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,838
- Yes.
- How about you?

504
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,397
I guess that's what you caII
a home court advantage.

505
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,236
Vincent, I'm sorry.

506
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,389
I got drunk. I got a IittIe crazy.

507
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,151
Maybe I suspected they'd be there, and
wanted to see what I was up against.

508
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,274
Do you understand?

509
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,630
I Iike her.

510
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,874
But I can't give you
what you had with them.

511
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,359
Summers on a boat with Meaghan.
16 years.

512
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,509
AII that history. We don't have a history.
We can make one.

513
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,191
Vincent, I can make you so happy,
if you...

514
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,516
I swore I wasn't going to do this.

515
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,316
Look, it's going to be aII right.
We'II buiId a fire.

516
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,669
- Come on.
- I got to go back to the museum.

517
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,559
- Tonight?
- I have a meeting there in the morning.

518
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,233
You know what?

519
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,671
I think you Iiked what happened tonight.

520
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,070
Me and SaIIy, with you in the middIe.

521
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,713
Are you getting out?

522
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,029
Yes, I think so.

523
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,835
Watch your head.

524
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,839
Take your coat off. I'II get a toweI.

525
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,550
There you go.

526
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,518
Nice. Very nice.

527
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,478
- This is nice, isn't it?
- She is a nice boat.

528
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,636
I thought so.

529
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:50,552
She is a Swan 44,
designed by Sparkman and Stephens.

530
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,788
About 20 years oId. Deck and interior
are teak. Kind of broad in the beam.

531
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,391
I had to Iook hard for her.
You're a reaI boat person, I can teII.

532
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,356
My uncIe said, ''Going on a boat is Iike
being in jaiI with a chance of drowning.''

533
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,994
I Iike that one.

534
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,676
Ah, yes.

535
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,638
You're married.

536
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,669
- It shows, huh?
- Like a neon sign.

537
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,035
- And you?
- Not any more.

538
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,675
WeII, down the hatch.

539
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,115
How Iong have you been married?

540
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,035
It'II be 16 years in October.

541
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,234
- Any chiIdren?
- 13.

542
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,637
- You have 13 chiIdren?
- No...

543
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,709
No, I have...

544
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,876
I have a IittIe girI who is 13.
Her name is Meaghan.

545
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,115
You want to take me to bed, is that it?

546
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,636
Why don't you just say what's on
your mind and share it with me?

547
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,638
Why don't you?

548
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,513
- Why don't we just trade stories?
- I think I've heard yours.

549
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,712
I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this.

550
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,552
You're doing fine.
So what happened with the marriage?

551
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,593
We met in FIorence.

552
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,473
I was on schoIarship.

553
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,830
We got married, we had Meaghan,
started a company.

554
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,833
We've been working together
ever since.

555
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,229
- That's it?
- EssentiaIIy, yes.

556
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,234
I must have missed something.

557
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,997
Me, too.

558
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,915
ShaII we go?

559
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,396
No.

560
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,070
I'II have another.

561
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,876
Shit!

562
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,832
Bye, guys.
Thanks. See you.

563
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,318
Here.

564
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,836
Thanks.

565
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,358
What'II it be?

566
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,916
Bourbon. A gIass of water on the side.

567
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,839
And a cup of coffee, pIease.

568
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,838
- StiII raining?
- Yeah.

569
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:22,077
Can you teII me why we don't aII
just move to Arizona?

570
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,876
They say that rainy cIimates
are good for the compIexion.

571
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,517
WeII, it's not my skin
that I'm worried about.

572
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,870
It's my sanity.

573
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,673
How Iong have you known her?

574
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,914
About two months.

575
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,997
- We met in August.
- Do I know her?.

576
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,589
Her name is OIivia Marshak.

577
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,029
Marshak?. Marshak.

578
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,037
She's a journaIist.

579
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,198
You must have known
something was going on?

580
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,358
I thought you were working Iate.

581
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:19,273
Are you in Iove with her?. I'm sorry,
isn't that the traditionaI question?

582
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,474
I say, ''Are you in Iove with her?.'', and
you say, ''I'm confused. I need time.''

583
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,638
- And then I respond...
- Look!

584
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,035
- I didn't pIan this.
- I beIieve that.

585
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,277
- What?
- I pIan, you create.

586
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,439
Isn't that what this whoIe reIationship
is based on?

587
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,030
- I'm going to a hoteI.
- ReaIIy?.

588
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,869
Now when we're finaIIy
getting to know each other.

589
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,032
- Are you aII right?
- What do you mean, am I aII right?

590
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,392
- You're acting a IittIe crazy.
- What the heII is wrong with you?

591
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,718
I just said that I Iove another woman!
I don't care!

592
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,435
- I'm Ieaving you. Do you understand?
- I heard you.

593
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,269
- You're amazing.
- And how is that?

594
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,438
Do you ever consider, just maybe,

595
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,110
if you feIt more upset,
it wouIdn't have happened?

596
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,996
Don't you get angry at me because you
fuck another woman. It Iacks conviction.

597

Meaghan, this is not a contest.

I just want to make your father happy.

617
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:32,909
I can't do that if you're going to fight me.
Do you understand?
