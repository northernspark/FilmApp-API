00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,551
The shadow monster
woke up.

3
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,804
It saw the boy
in the pot and said:

4
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,557
"Mmm. I'm starving."

5
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,101
"I'm going to eat you up."

6
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,563
So the monster opened
his mouth wide and...

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,358
swallowed
the little tailor whole.

8
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,693
The boy fell

9
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,195
and fell
into a dark cave

10
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,739
filled with slime...

11
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,367
Is that it?

12
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,579
That's all
I could come up with.

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,081
Well, you'll think
of something tomorrow.

14
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,499
Let's go to bed.

15
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,462
But I'm not sleepy
and I haven't finished it yet.

16
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,840
I know, sweetie,
but Mommy's tired from working all day

17
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,884
and she needs to sleep.

18
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,512
Here, I'll carry you.

19
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,265
God, you're heavy!

20
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,728
Your story
needs an ending.

21
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,813
Let's see if I can help.

22
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,857
Let me think...

23
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,862
Remember the scissors
the tailor had given his son?

24
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,366
Well, suddenly
he remembered
he still had them.

25
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,953
He took them out
and started cutting.

26
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:06,793
Snip, snip, snip...

27
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,964
And the monster shouted:
"Ouch!"

28
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,467
"Who's cutting me?"
And the little tailor...

29
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,260
I know, I know!

30
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,471
The boy cuts
his way out,

31
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,890
makes himself
a monster-skin coat

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,227
and the arrows couldn't hurt him any more.
I'll finish it right now.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,896
You're going to sleep
or you'll be tired in the morning.

34
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,231
Mom...

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,442
We'll get the little boy out
of the monster's belly
in the morning.

36
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:36,155
Don't shut it, Meow is still outside.
He might want to come in.

37
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,455
No dreaming
about monsters, okay?

38
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,628
Come!

39
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,749
Leave her alone,
monster!

40
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,455
Let him go!

41
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,560
Mommy!

42
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,336
Mommy!

43
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,144
Mommy, Mommy!

44
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
There, there...

45
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,026
It's over, sweetie.
There, there...

46
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,987
The monster came in
through the window.

47
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,241
It wanted to take me away.
It was... It had no face.

48
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,203
There's no monster in here.
It was only a nightmare.

49
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,539
It was only a nightmare.

50
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,957
Don't worry.

51
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,209
It's over.
What if he comes back?

52
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,171
If he comes back, close your eyes
and count to five.

53
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,465
When you open them,
he'll be gone, you'll see.

54
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,214
I'm going to call her.
She is driving me crazy.

55
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,340
I can't stop
thinking about her.

56
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,008
Oh, I'm sure
Carol would be very happy about that.

57
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,635
Fuck off.
You're not an angel.

58
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,136
Don't tell me
you never thought about it.

59
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,680
Listen, mate,
I'm very happy with what I've got.

60
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,933
I mean,
what could be so wrong

61
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,517
with a bit of
no-questions-asked,

62
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,061
harmless fun with
a filthy stranger

63
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,229
to spice up
your love life?

64
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,272
Just as long as Carol
doesn't find out.

65
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,482
And if she does?

66
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,570
I'd deny it,
wouldn't you?

67
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,823
Listen, mate,
if I were you,

68
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,451
I'd just get it out of the way
and tell her everything now.

69
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,119
Fuck off!

70
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,829
Come on!

71
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,879
Keep an eye on Frank.
I have to call my daughter.

72
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,806
She is just very lonely.

73
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,349
She must miss you.

74
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,644
Yes, she does. She misses me very much,
but my brother's there, so...

75
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,272
Send them my love.

76
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,565
I will. That's nice
of you, thank you.

77
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,318
Yeah, I know,
she is old.

78
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,745
Hey, Dad.
Where are you?

79
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,247
Sorry, sweetheart.
I'm still at work.

80
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,456
I'm gonna be
another hour.

81
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,418
That's too bad.
Grandma made me her famous cake.

82
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,627
Yeah, don't tell me,

83
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,422
chocolate, jam in the middle
and fake cream on top.

84
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,799
Is Mom there?
Can I talk to her?

85
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,967
Sure.

86
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,096
Dad wants to
talk to you.

87
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,682
Hey, baby.

88
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,270
Yeah. Okay.

89
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,230
Mia, it's so good
to see you.

90
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,859
Where is Winnie going?

91
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:58,282
Yeah? Okay,
love you, too. Bye.

92
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,999
Hey, Winnie,
where are you?

93
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,085
Winnie,
where are you?

94
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,852
Where are you going?

95
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,813
What have you found?

96
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,539
"Hollowface woke up
because someone called his name.

97
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,293
"After many,
many years, he was free.

98
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,715
"He wasn't young or old,
or ugly or handsome.

99
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,219
"He had no shape,
he didn't even have a face.

100
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,183
"He remembered a boy
with a face that looked like him.

101
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,060
"Hollowface had
to find the boy.

102
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,898
"He had to
find his face.

103
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,614
"Until one night,
Hollowface finally found a face to steal.

104
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:49,077
"It was a little boy
staring out of a window.

105
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,458
"Hollowface wanted
the boy's face

106
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,418
"more than anything
else in the world.

107
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,754
"Without a face,

108
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,548
"he had nothing.

109
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,301
"So he devised a plan.

110
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,637
"First,

111
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,139
"he'd separate the boy
from his parents.

112
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,934
"Then he'd take him
back to his lair.

113
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,103
"He'd rip off his face
and wear it himself.

114
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,941
"That way,
everybody would love him.

115
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:21,902
"The next night,

116
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,445
"Hollowface
dressed up as a man

117
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,780
"and went back
to the boy's house.

118
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,115
"He ran up
the wall quickly.

119
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,118
"He slipped
through an open window.

120
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,455
"He found the boy's room
and slipped inside.

121
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,874
"The boy was sleeping.

122
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,462
"Hollowface moved
closer and closer,

123
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,714
"and closer."

124
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,136
Continue, Mia.

125
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,975
That's all I have.

126
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,309
You haven't
finished it?

127
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,770
I didn't know how to.

128
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,147
It's not bad.

129
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,984
You've hooked your audience
and left us with a cliff-hanger.

130
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,653
Try to finish it
for next week.

131
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,738
Well, we are all
looking forward

132
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,490
to finding out
what happens next, aren't we?

133
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,042
See you later.

134
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,044
Oh, what time is
the party again?

135
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,213
6:00. Don't forget.

136
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,132
Okay, bye!
See you.

137
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,424
Hey!
You're late.

138
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,051
Sorry.
Who is she?

139
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,556
You're sweaty.
Come, you have to do the cake.

140
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,980
Hey, birthday girl!

141
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,649
Daddy!

142
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,194
Happy birthday.

143
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,371
It's a teddy bear!

144
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,123
We got you
something else, too.

145
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,591
Wow, thanks.

146
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,514
It's so cool!

147
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,932
I've wanted one
of them for ages!

148
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,809
Great.
Oh, yes.

149
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,897
You know, it's actually an antique,
it's nearly 50 years old.

150
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,151
An old
teddy bear. Cool.

151
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,029
I love it, Dad, really.

152
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,536
So, how old
are you again? Nine? Ten?

153
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,578
Dad.

154
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:19,913
Four?

155
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,207
Okay, guys.
It's time.

156
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,671
Happy birthday to you

157
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,924
Happy birthday to you

158
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,721
Happy birthday, dear Mia

159
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,224
Happy birthday to you

160
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,894
Whoo!

161
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,321
Hollowface woke up
because someone called his name.

162
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:57,409
After many,
many years, he was free.

163
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,580
When Hollowface
came out of his lair,

164
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,540
the people looked
right through him.

165
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,917
It was like
he was invisible.

166
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,505
He saw people
in the street, talking and kissing.

167
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,343
And he knew that,
without a face, no one could love him.

168
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,682
Hollowface kept
hunting for a boy to steal his face.

169
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:25,312
He looked everywhere,
in every window of every house.

170
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,691
Until one night,
he found a house with a child inside.

171
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,069
And an open window.

172
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,535
He crept
through the rooms

173
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,747
and down the corridor,

174
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,709
where he saw a girl
who was still awake.

175
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,588
So he crept closer,
and closer.

176
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,425
And he forgot all about
hunting for the boy.

177
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,053
Now, Hollowface
wanted the girl's face

178
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,846
more than anything else
in the world.

179
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,140
So, he devised a plan.

180
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,643
He would hide
in the dark corner of her room

181
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,813
and wait for her
to go to sleep, and then he would...

182
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,449
I really want one.

183
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,575
One?

184
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,370
Just one.
No.

185
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,913
Yes, just one.
No.

186
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,414
No, don't.

187
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,917
You don't need it.
I do.

188
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,919
That's pathetic.

189
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,631
Mia.

190
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,383
Mia, go to your room.

191
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,093
What is it?
What's the matter, sweetheart?

192
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,012
Mia, you've school
tomorrow, go.

193
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,398
John.

194
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,941
Come on,
it's her birthday.

195
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,660
Are you okay,
birthday girl?

196
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,539
I can't sleep.

197
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,044
Too much Coca-Cola?

198
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,212
It's not that.

199
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,798
No? What is it then?

200
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,141
Come on,
let's get you into bed.

201
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,775
Oh, I can see
you love my present.

202
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,904
Dad, I'm 12 years old.

203
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,114
Did you hear that?

204
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,035
Sorry, mate,
I think you should've stayed in the shop.

205
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,537
Looks like she is
just a little bit too grown-up for you.

206
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,374
Oh, yeah.
She's wearing lipstick and everything.

207
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,005
Come on,
you should try to sleep.

208
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,971
Good night,
sweetheart.

209
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,809
I love you, Dad.

210
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,853
I love you, too.

211
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:36,294
One, two, three,
four, five.

212
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,119
"He was a murderer
from the beginning,

213
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,080
and did not abide
in the truth,

214
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,083
because there is
no truth in him.

215
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,462
If ye continue
in my word,

216
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,174
then ye are
my disciples indeed.

217
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,510
And ye shall
know the truth,

218
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,763
and the truth
will make you free."

219
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,729
Wait for us here.

220
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,277
We can do it here
if you like.

221
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,497
You have to say,
"Hail, Mary, full of grace."

222
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,626
Hail, Mary,
full of grace.

223
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,336
The Lord is with thee.

224
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,886
When was
your last confession?

225
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:10,764
I don't know.

226
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,515
I don't remember.

227
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:13,808
That's okay.

228
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,313
Go ahead, tell me.

229
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,861
You needn't
be ashamed.

230
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,488
The Lord is good

231
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,406
and always forgives us.

232
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,246
Come on.

233
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,957
It can't be that bad.

234
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,302
Come on, Juan.
We're leaving.

235
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,194
No, no, no.
Keep going.

236
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,487
Sorry, mate.

237
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,658
Come on, you.
Concentrate.

238
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,369
You've gotta get
all that done by today.

239
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,746
You're the boss.

240
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,338
Help!

241
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:14,179
Help!

242
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,437
Please, mate, hurry,
I'm gonna fall!

243
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,105
John, help!

244
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,317
I can't hold on.
Come on, John, hurry up, mate!

245
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,068
Hurry up, I'm gonna
fucking let it go.

246
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,153
Hold on!

247
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,571
John!

248
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:12,403
John! I'm going to fall!

249
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,322
Frank!
Frank! Frank!

250
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,899
Dad?
Jesus.

251
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,153
You scared
the life out of me!

252
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,199
Are you okay, sweetheart?
What's the matter?

253
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,493
I had a nightmare.

254
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,245
What was it about?

255
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,336
Come, Mia.

256
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,637
Come on,
let's go back to bed.

257
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,930
You have
school tomorrow.

258
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,934
What if the nightmare
comes back?

259
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,313
Come on.

260
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,731
Dad, where are
we going?

261
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,107
Come on, it's fine.

262
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,616
Shit.

263
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,414
Dad.

264
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,541
Why are you standing
out there? Come on.

265
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,927
What are you doing?

266
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,387
Yes, got it.

267
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,805
Do you remember this?

268
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,351
The anti-nightmare book!

269
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,019
Dad, this is ridiculous.

270
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:54,440
Come on. Come and sit down.
Haven't read this in ages.

271
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,484
Come on.

272
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,988
Now, which one
shall we read?

273
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,824
That one.
This one?

274
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,493
Okay. So...

275
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:12,417
"If a big red devil
with big teeth and claws comes to you

276
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:17,797
"and tries to squeeze you in its jaws,
just light it up and say..."

277
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:19,674
Dad.

278
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,929
Oh, you're
too grown... "Boo!"

279
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,270
"And you'll see it's just a shadow and
you can see it through."

280
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,273
See, monsters
are cowards.

281
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,941
If you stand up to them,
they run away.

282
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,278
Not this one.

283
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,281
This one's different.

284
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,324
They're all the same.
All cowards.

285
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,119
And you know
they'd never dare come

286
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,079
into this house if
they know I'm here.

287
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,667
But he's already inside.

288
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,713
What do you mean?
Where?

289
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,048
I don't know.

290
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,260
I think he spies on me
when I'm asleep.

291
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,220
I know he's there.

292
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,517
Right.

293
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,021
Now,

294
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:21,861
to kill a monster,
you have to enter their story.

295
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,574
See, they think
you're gonna run away,

296
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,452
but if you
enter their story,

297
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,289
they're screwed.
So...

298
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,921
Now, there's
something missing.

299
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,097
Ah! Perfect.

300
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,601
Wow! There he is.

301
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,938
There's our monster.

302
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,440
So,

303
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,734
you think
you're scary, huh?

304
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,820
Now, listen, mate.

305
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,740
It's the end
of the road.

306
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,951
We've had enough.

307
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:15,623
You cannot keep
bothering my daughter at night.

308
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,843
Okay, stand back.

309
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,818
Whoa.
Look at him go.

310
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,280
Wow.

311
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,491
Basketball face, go.

312
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:51,742
Look at his face.

313
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:55,997
Ooh.

314
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,832
Spooky.

315
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,417
He looks so angry.

316
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,048
What the hell
are you doing?

317
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,717
Are you crazy?
What is this?

318
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,926
Mia, go to your room.

319
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,803
It's all right.
We were just playing.

320
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,889
What do you mean "playing"?
You could have burned the house down.

321
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,474
She had a nightmare.

322
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,142
We were just
getting rid of it.

323
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,310
What do you mean
"getting rid of it"?

324
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,811
What do you mean?
What is this?

325
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,855
Sue. It was a game.

326
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,777
Throw this thing away
before it stinks up the whole house.

327
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,208
Mommy!

328
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,837
Mommy!

329
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,342
Juan...

330
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,678
It's okay, sweetie.
There, there.

331
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,555
It's over.

332
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,153
Please, come in.

333
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,705
Juan.

334
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,542
Father Antonio is
here to see you.

335
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,931
He doesn't seem
to have a fever.

336
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,101
Hi, Juan.

337
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,728
My name is Antonio.

338
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:32,106
Do you remember me?

339
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,649
Look.

340
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,026
I brought your toy.

341
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,821
I'll leave it here,
okay?

342
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,411
Your mother says
you're having trouble sleeping.

343
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,454
Go away.

344
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,250
Why do you say that?

345
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,128
It's nothing to
be ashamed of.

346
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,338
I had nightmares
at your age too.

347
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,757
They aren't nightmares.

348
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,844
What are you scared of?

349
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,304
Witches?

350
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,472
No such thing.

351
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,309
And the bogeyman
isn't real either.

352
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,688
My parents told me about him
so I'd finish my dinner.

353
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,398
It's just a story.

354
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,567
You needn't be
afraid of stories.

355
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,738
Here's what we'll do:

356
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:25,618
You tell me what
you're scared of,

357
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,872
and I'll tell you
what scares me, okay?

358
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,752
I have a friend
I talk to every day who I can't see.

359
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,338
I'm scared...

360
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,007
my friend
won't answer me.

361
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,178
That I'll talk to him
and he won't say anything.

362
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,182
Now it's your turn.

363
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,684
What are you scared of?

364
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,489
Hollowface.

365
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,582
Who is Hollowface?

366
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,219
Mia, what's the matter?

367
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,359
What is it?
What's wrong?

368
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,904
Tell me.

369
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,825
He's here.

370
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,869
He's inside.

371
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,916
No, come on,
sweetheart.

372
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,962
There's nobody here,
it's just you and me.

373
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,640
Look.

374
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,101
Daddy, look.

375
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,053
Mia, get out.

376
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,395
Get out!

377
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,915
Dad!

378
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,484
Dad!

379
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:10,694
Help me!

380
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:22,998
John!

381
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,083
John, what's going on?
Call the police!

382
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:26,710
Call the police!

383
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,489
Please.

384
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,244
Just let her go.

385
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,749
Don't hurt her.

386
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,927
My God! Sweetheart,
are you okay?

387
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,428
Are you okay?

388
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,435
What's going on?

389
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,521
There was
a fucking man in the room.

390
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,318
Are you okay?
Are you okay? Baby...

391
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,071
It's okay, it's okay.

392
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,206
Awful business.

393
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,083
I think he must've come in
through the window.

394
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,337
I chased after him,
but he'd gone.

395
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,382
Did you see his face?
Could you give us a description?

396
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,010
It was dark.
He had a hood on.

397
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,103
Get that to forensics,
George.

398
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,397
Now, once an intruder
has been seen,

399
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,148
he very rarely
comes back.

400
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,193
We'll get him.
Don't worry, Mr. Farrow.

401
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:39,736
Thank you.

402
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,796
He said not to worry.
He said he definitely won't come back.

403
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,509
It's okay.

404
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,784
You sit down here,
lovely.

405
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,877
Has she said anything?

406
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,295
What do you want her
to say?

407
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,130
She's terrified.

408
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,429
Are you okay?

409
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,019
What is it, sweetheart?
Talk to me.

410
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,855
Mia.

411
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,485
Talk to me.

412
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,537
Sweetheart,
tell me what's wrong.

413
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,296
Mia.

414
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,388
Sweetheart,
what is it?

415
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,773
One, two, three, four...

416
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,824
Mommy, Mommy!

417
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,495
Juan...

418
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:29,716
How are you?

419
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,926
Everything okay?

420
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,722
No wonder
the father ran off.

421
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:37,932
Did she tell you that?

422
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:39,934
No.

423
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,937
She speaks
only of a presence,

424
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,607
that there's something
inside the boy.

425
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,403
They're both nuts,
the boy and the mother.

426
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,656
They would spook anyone.

427
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,408
She told you more
than she told me.

428
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,453
You don't know
how to treat women.

429
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,082
Will you help them?

430
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,501
What do you
want me to do?

431
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,588
I don't know.
Make them think you got rid of it.

432
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,215
Got rid of what?

433
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,804
We're talking about
something very serious.

434
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,140
It wouldn't have
to be official.

435
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,768
It would be
like a placebo.

436
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,271
Antonio, you can't perform
such a serious ritual

437
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,149
just to settle the nerves
of a crazy woman.

438
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,276
No matter
how pretty she is.

439
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,280
You can't play around
with this stuff, damn it.

440
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,785
Leave them alone.

441
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:42,872
This is a job
for a psychiatrist,

442
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,250
not for us.

443
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:06,813
And then he leapt
from your window?

444
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,399
Oh, Mia. I'm sorry.

445
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,986
What a terrible thing
to go through, it must be terrifying!

446
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,908
And you haven't
been able to speak ever since?

447
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,786
Or you haven't
wanted to?

448
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,374
Things and...
It's important I know.

449
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,009
You can't.

450
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,554
You know,
it's all right to be afraid.

451
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,142
I get scared too sometimes.
Everyone does.

452
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,784
Please,
come with me.

453
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,539
As there's nothing physically preventing
your daughter from speaking,

454
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,918
her silence is an acute
emotional response

455
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,920
to the severe shock
she experienced.

456
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,130
So what do we do?

457
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,591
Oh, you have to
be patient.

458
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:19,719
Should she keep
going to school?

459
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,804
Oh, yes, absolutely.

460
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:22,639
You don't want to
disrupt her routine,

461
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,891
but I will need to
see Mia every day.

462
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,059
Every day?

463
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,729
Mr. Farrow,

464
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,650
I'm sure you want
to avoid Mia re-living the experience

465
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,735
through flashbacks
or recurring nightmares.

466
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,154
We want to facilitate

467
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,365
the successful,
emotional processing

468
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,659
of the trauma through
basic counselling.

469
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:48,373
During the sessions,
Mia will confront her fears.

470
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,752
We've found the method
to be extremely effective for the children...

471
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,684
Hollowface
did not give up.

472
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,604
He would wait for the right moment
to rip off the girl's face.

473
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:16,025
Hollowface crept closer,
and closer and closer.

474
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,660
You haven't got one
that's a bit quieter?

475
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,786
Quieter?

476
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,497
Wouldn't have a Chihuahua
as a guard dog, would you?

477
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:30,832
This is a Rottweiler.

478
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,712
It's an excellent choice.
Complete security package.

479
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,255
No more worries.

480
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,383
How about...

481
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,940
I made you
something to eat.

482
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,653
You're doing
your homework?

483
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:06,034
Listen, Mia, you don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

484
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,169
"Want to." Okay.

485
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,841
Come, come here.
Come here. Sit.

486
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:35,730
You can
only access the images

487
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,440
on the central Web site
with a password.

488
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,524
It's very secure.

489
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,488
Yes, hi, mate, yeah.
I need to enter a password for a customer.

490
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,618
Name, John Farrow.
Yep.

491
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,287
One, nine, six, seven.

492
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,339
Hi, Juan.

493
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,632
How are you?

494
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:04,342
Remember me?

495
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:29,367
Juan.

496
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,577
Mommy, I'm having fun!

497
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,829
We're leaving.

498
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,914
We can't be here.

499
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,165
Let's go.

500
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,556
Come on.

501
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,601
Juan...

502
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,439
Hollowface crept
closer, and closer.

503
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,941
The girl knew that
Hollowface was there.

504
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,485
She could feel him
watching her.

505
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,988
She wanted to
scream for help,

506
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,657
but when she opened her mouth
she couldn't make a sound.

507
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,410
Her parents couldn't
keep her safe

508
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,413
because Hollowface
was already inside.

509
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:20,501
He'd made a new lair
right in her room,

510
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:23,463
in a dark corner
everyone had forgotten about.

511
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,508
His new lair was big enough
for both of them.

512
00:56:28,761 --> 00:56:31,220
Hollowface would drag
the girl into his lair

513
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,389
and keep her there
in the dark,

514
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:38,603
imprison her,
away from her parents, forever.

515
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,190
Then she wouldn't
need her face ever again.

516
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,110
He started calling her
to his lair.

517
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,821
She felt his claws
reaching out to her.

518
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,910
John!

519
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:25,334
Mia, are you okay?
Are you okay?

520
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,686
She's fine now.
Her blood pressure is very low.

521
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,812
She needs to rest.

522
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,439
We're going to run
some allergy tests.

523
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,901
Anaphylactic shock is
a severe hypersensitivity body reaction,

524
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,569
but I don't want you
to worry, Mrs. Farrow,

525
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,029
we will find
what triggered it.

526
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,947
In the meantime,
I'm gonna prescribe

527
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,866
some intravenous
adrenaline and sedatives

528
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,201
in case of emergency.

529
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,621
If she loses consciousness
and the ambulance takes too long,

530
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,164
you can
inject it yourself.

531
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:05,917
It takes only
a couple of seconds to take effect.

532
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,168
I'll have a nurse
show you how it works.

533
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,294
Okay. Thank you.

534
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,129
I'll go get a nurse.

535
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,133
Could you
give us a description?

536
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,427
Yeah, he looked
really weird.

537
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,472
It was like...

538
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:21,641
It was like
he was deformed.

539
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:23,351
Deformed?

540
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,812
But it's a good job
you installed those security cameras.

541
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:30,691
I'll have one of my men
check the coverage.

542
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:33,236
But we'll need
your password.

543
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,320
Yeah, of course.

544
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,493
Sorry, would you
excuse me?

545
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,454
Hey, how is she?

546
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,498
She's all right.
She's all right.

547
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,798
It's Dave.

548
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,134
Please, take him.
He's been calling the whole time.

549
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:58,844
Hello?

550
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,682
Mrs. Farrow,

551
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:04,767
can you tell me
what happened tonight?

552
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,020
I'm calling because
your mother asked me to.

553
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,188
Your mother
wants us to be...

554
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,523
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

555
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:11,941
I'm taking care
of the situation.

556
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,150
She is worried
about Mia.

557
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:14,694
How is she, John?

558
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,446
I didn't see him.
I just...

559
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,572
John?

560
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:21,033
Dave, I can't talk right now.
Sorry, I've gotta go.

561
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:26,789
Dave, how are they?

562
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,208
They'll be fine.

563
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,063
Sit down.

564
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,409
Come with me, Juan.

565
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,042
Lie down.

566
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,762
We're going to
pray together.

567
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:25,473
I'm going to
say a prayer

568
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,477
and repeat after me,
all right?

569
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,272
Mommy says you're going to make
Hollowface go away.

570
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:34,482
That's right.

571
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,443
Jesus will come,
he'll grab Hollowface

572
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:38,736
and poof.

573
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,823
He'll throw him
into a pit so deep he'll never get out.

574
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:44,867
But Hollowface can fly.

575
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,036
Juan, keep quiet
and obey the father.

576
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:48,954
Cross yourselves.

577
01:01:58,590 --> 01:01:59,882
Give me your hand.

578
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:06,472
"You, Lord,
are my refuge.

579
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:10,559
He shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler

580
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,686
and from
the noisome pestilence."

581
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,022
Repeat it.

582
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,525
"You, Lord,
are my refuge.

583
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:20,486
He shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler

584
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,113
and from
the noisome..."

585
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,409
"From
the noisome pestilence."

586
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:30,079
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,

587
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,998
nor for the arrow
that flieth by day."

588
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:35,876
Juan.

589
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,378
Please.

590
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:39,839
I don't want to.

591
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:44,385
That's all right.

592
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,012
We'll try something else.

593
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:48,764
I'll pray

594
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:52,518
and you repeat it
to yourself in silence.

595
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:54,645
Close your eyes.

596
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,151
"Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night,

597
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,862
nor for the arrow
that flieth by day."

598
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:21,297
I can't.

599
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,384
I can't do it.

600
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,722
I can't expel him
if I don't know who he is.

601
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:33,100
You know who he is,
don't you?

602
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,937
He has no face.

603
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,608
His face is hidden.

604
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,568
I can't see it.

605
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,113
You can't see it
because he's wearing a hood, right?

606
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:53,245
Close your eyes.

607
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,499
Try to imagine his face.

608
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,752
Take it off.

609
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:01,587
Take off his hood.

610
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
Father, that's enough.

611
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,215
Good, Juan.

612
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,176
Good.

613
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,068
He's there.

614
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:29,907
Where, Juan?

615
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,036
There.

616
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,829
Where is he?

617
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:51,971
There's nothing there.

618
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,484
What do you see?

619
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:16,287
He's gone.

620
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,082
It's only a statue.

621
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:24,086
Luisa.

622
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,338
You can't help us.

623
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:29,717
There's nothing
you can do.

624
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,344
It's only a statue.

625
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,180
You imagined
the whole thing.

626
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:36,890
Luisa!

627
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:42,896
Luisa...

628
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,607
Tell me what you saw.

629
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,092
Mommy,
where are we going?

630
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,178
I don't know.
Far away.

631
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,597
Juan, help me.
Close your suitcase.

632
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,974
Do you think
he'll follow us?

633
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,019
No, because we're going far away.
Do you understand?

634
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,232
You saw him too,
didn't you?

635
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,568
Juan, I didn't
see anything.

636
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,987
You hear me?
Nothing.

637
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,137
What's going on?

638
01:06:57,722 --> 01:06:58,931
Good morning, John.
Come through.

639
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,936
Is everything okay?

640
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:12,695
Sue, where's Mia?
Is she okay?

641
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,029
She's here, John.
She'll be fine.

642
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,614
Hello, John.

643
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:17,866
What is this?

644
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,452
Please, John,
take a seat.

645
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,543
Mia knows that
she has the full love

646
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,128
and support of
both her parents,

647
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:30,921
especially you, John.

648
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,215
You have a very
special bond with her.

649
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,842
I should hope so,
I'm her father.

650
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,930
Susanna tells me that
you haven't slept well since your incident at work.

651
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,226
Well, I think we've
all had trouble sleeping

652
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,019

653
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,438
in my daughter's
bedroom at night.

654
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,106
I understand.

655
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:54,069
John, there is
a very rare syndrome,

656
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:55,529
which is often
brought on by stress,

657
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:58,657
which occurs when
two people's psyches become entwined.

658
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,912
It's a shared disorder,
called "folie a deux."

659
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,374
When two people with
close emotional ties

660
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,793
share the same
hallucination.

661
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,464
Hallucination?

662
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,176
There's no intruder,
John.

663
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:22,848
It's in your imagination
and in Mia's.

664
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,985
What the fuck are
you talking about?

665
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:37,613
John, I'd like you to
look at this, please.

666
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,723
Play that again.

667
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,168
What is this?

668
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:34,461
There was
no one there, John.

669
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,881
Nobody else in the room,
but you and your daughter.

670
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,174
Mr. Farrow.

671
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,634
Who the fuck are you?

672
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,262
This is David Wareton
from Social Services.

673
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,931
We're all here
to help you, John.

674
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,768
The condition can be
treated very successfully through therapy,

675
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:57,276
but, John,
the first step will be

676
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,027
to separate you
from Mia for a while.

677
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,989
If you have
nowhere else to go,

678
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:03,156
we can help you out
with that.

679
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,785
I recommend that you speak
to my colleague, Dr. Nowinski.

680
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,995
He said he'll treat you.

681
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:12,583
This is ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense.
I was in the fucking room!

682
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:16,503
He was there,
he was attacking my daughter.

683
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:21,633
Sue, you were there,
tell them.

684
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,095
Sue.

685
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:31,977
Tell them!

686
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,271
Mr. Farrow,
you need to calm down.

687
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:39,484
I didn't see anything.

688
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,323
You saw the video.
There's nobody there.

689
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:50,996
I don't fucking
believe you.

690
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,391
So you think
I'm crazy, do you?

691
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:16,480
Don't worry.

692
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,858
By the time you get home,
I'll be out.

693
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,793
Mia,
when we get home,

694
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,920
Daddy is not
gonna be there.

695
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,757
We have to separate you
for a little while.

696
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,772
Mum says you've been
writing a story at school.

697
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:02,651
Who is Hollowface?

698
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,116
Susanna, it might
be easier for Mia

699
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,742
if you left us alone
for a minute.

700
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,757
Mia, is there something
you want to tell us?

701
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:43,650
Did your father
tell you the story?

702
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,782
You know
Hollowface isn't real?

703
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:24,584
Okay, Mrs. Farrow...

704
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:31,883
If he comes near
the house again,

705
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,052
Mrs. Farrow,
please let us know immediately.

706
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:35,387
Yes, I will.

707
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,598
We can get a court order.
No, no, no.

708
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,600
It won't be necessary,
seriously.

709
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:41,935
Okay.

710
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:46,815
So, this is the room.

711
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,400
It's a nice room, Mia.

712
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,278
Do you mind if
we talk outside?

713
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,407
Mia, I'm gonna be back
in a minute, yeah?

714
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,051
Mia.

715
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,265
What if we go
for a nice yummy meal tonight?

716
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,311
Yeah? Like a Chinese restaurant?
What do you think?

717
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:08,480
Good idea?

718
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:10,815
Let's go.

719
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,443
Luisa,

720
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,653
can I speak with you
when you have a minute?

721
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,991
He says he wants
to talk to you.

722
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:50,910
Mommy!

723
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:04,174
Mommy!

724
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,552
Don't worry,
it must just be
a nightmare.

725
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,472
I'm sure
he'll calm down.

726
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,894
Mommy!

727
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,689
One, two, three,

728
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:26,941
four, five.

729
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:30,069
There you'll
stay forever.

730
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,671
Hollowface woke up
because someone called his name.

731
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,549
After many,
many years,

732
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,260
he was free.

733
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,010
John?

734
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:37,261
He's back.

735
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:40,431
Who is back?

736
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:42,433
You know who.

737
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,147
I don't know what
you're talking about, son.

738
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,024
Yes, you do.

739
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:53,695
No.

740
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:56,781
It can't be.

741
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,827
You said I made him up.

742
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:02,620
That I was dreaming.

743
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,083
You lied to me.

744
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:28,563
I'm sorry.

745
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,274
I'm so sorry.

746
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,152
He's hurting Mia.

747
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,489
I was only trying
to protect you.

748
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,283
From what?

749
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:42,034
Son...

750
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:45,872
Forgive me.

751
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:48,958
Tell me.

752
01:24:57,176 --> 01:24:59,343
I'm sorry,
I had to lie to you.

753
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:03,890
He came to take you that night.
It wasn't a nightmare.

754
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:55,751
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

755
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:58,087
Three, four, five...

756
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:01,299
Come on. Baby!

757
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:08,180
It's me!

758
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,111
John, she can't breathe!

759
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,363
What's happening?
The shot's not working.

760
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,865
Call an ambulance!

761
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:32,705
It's me. I'm here.
Can you hear me?

762
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:42,214
I know he's here and
I know you're afraid, but that's all over now,

763
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:45,009
because I know who he is
and I know why he came back.

764
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:54,393
Come on, keep talking,
keep talking, keep talking.

765
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,527
Hollowface woke up
because someone called his name.

766
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,031
After many,
many years, he was free.

767
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:13,496
He wasn't young or old,
ugly or handsome.

768
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:16,040
He had no shape,

769
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:18,209
he didn't even
have a face.

770
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:28,094
They had locked him away
in a dark, tiny hole where the sun never shone.

771
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,936
He remembered a boy
with a face that looks like him.

772
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:41,774
Hollowface had
to find the boy.

773
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:44,360
He had to
find his face.

774
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:51,450
When he finally found
where the boy was hiding,

775
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,577
Hollowface didn't
know what to do.

776
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:59,500
Seeing the mother
kiss the boy made him feel envious.

777
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,794
He wanted to
be like the boy.

778
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:05,256
He wanted to be loved.
So he devised a plan.

779
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:09,885
First, he'd separate
the boy from his mother.

780
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,389
Then he'd bring him
to his lair.

781
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:18,436
And he would
rip off his face and wear it himself.

782
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:26,819
Hollowface moved closer

783
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:33,075
and closer, and closer.

784
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,954
You don't know the rest
of the story, but I do.

785
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:42,168
Hollowface couldn't find the boy
and that made him furious.

786
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,299
Where's the boy?

787
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,134
Leave her alone,
monster!

788
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,813
Don't be afraid, son.

789
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,774
You look like me.

790
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:21,499
Mia.

791
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:23,959
Mia, you have
to fight back.

792
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:26,670
You have to.

793
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:28,839
Mia.

794
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:32,259
You have to fight back.
You have to fight back, Mia.

795
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:45,439
Hollowface never
stole the boy's face.

796
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,525
Because Hollowface
didn't realise something.

797
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:57,243
The boy's mother
would never let him take

798
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:59,411
her son away without
putting up a fight.

799
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:05,417
Mommy!

800
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:18,556
Help me, son!

801
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:23,561
Help me!

802
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:24,645
No.

803
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:46,834
Because parents
are always willing

804
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,879
to do anything
to protect their children.

805
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:19,033
It's all right.
I'm here.

806
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:21,785
You're safe.

807
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:30,544
He's gone.

808
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:33,672
He will never come back again,
I promise.

809
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:41,180
It's over.

810
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:41,115
Hollowface woke up
because someone called his name.

811
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:50,958
Hollowface wasn't old or young,
ugly or handsome.

812
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:56,922
He had no shape,

813
