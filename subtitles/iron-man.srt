2
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,760
I feel like you're driving me to
court martial. This is crazy.

3
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
What did I do? I feel like you're
gonna pull over and snuff me.

4
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,040
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forest...

5
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,080
- We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?

6
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,760
No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,760
Dear God, you're a woman!
I honestly, I couldn't have called that.

8
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,400
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,880
I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,960
Well you have actually excellent
bone structure there. I'm kinda...

11
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,840
having a hard time not looking
at you now. Is that weird?

12
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,760
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!

13
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,240
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,520
It is true you went 12-for-12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,280
That is an excellent question.

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,800
Yes and no. March and I
had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,200
but fortunately the Christmas
cover was twins. Anything else?

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,240
You're kidding me
with a hand up, right?

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,440
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,240
Yes, it's very cool.

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,680
I don't wanna see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,360
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,000
No, throw it up, I'm kidding.

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,080
Yeah, peace! I love peace.
I'd be outta job with peace.

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,960
C'mon! Just click it, don't change
the settings, just click it.

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,840
What's going on?

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,120
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,640
Lie down!

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,640
Son of a bitch!

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,960
- Wait, wait, give me a gun!
- Stay here!

31
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,920
Tony Stark.

32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
Visionary. Genius.
American patriot.

33
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,960
Even from an early age,

34
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,440
the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark

35
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,560
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,680
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.

37
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,560
At age six, his first engine.

38
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,600
And at seventeen, he graduated
Summa Cum Laude from MIT.

39
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,120
Then, the passing of a titan.

40
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,960
Howard Stark's life long friend
and ally Obadiah Stane,

41
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,160
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder.

42
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,360
Until at age 21,
the prodigal son returns,

43
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,640
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

44
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,760
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era

45
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,560
for his father's legacy,
creating smarter weapons,

46
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,040
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.

47
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,760
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry,

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,440
by ensuring freedom

49
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,360
and protecting America and
her interests around the globe.

50
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,640
As liaison to Stark Industries,

51
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,600
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

52
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,200
He is my friend and
he is my great mentor.

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

54
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,160
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark!

55
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Tony?

56
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,040
Thank you, Colonel.

57
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,040
This is beautiful. Thank you.

58
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,120
Thank you all very much.
This is wonderful.

59
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

60
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,040
But if I were Tony...

61
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,320
...I would tell you
how honored I feel,

62
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,760
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.

63
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,720
Tony, you know,
the best thing about Tony...

64
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,160
...is also the worst thing -
he's always working.

65
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
C'mon!

66
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,200
We should just stay
till the morning.

67
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,680
- You are unbelievable!
- Oh, no. They roped you into this?

68
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,360
Nobody roped me into anything.
But they told me...

69
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,000
that if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

70
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,280
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you!

71
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,200
That's great. So when do we do it?
One more round. - There you go.

72
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,640
There it is. That was easy.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK.

73
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,120
Wow, would you look at that?
That's... that's something else.

74
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,800
I don't have any of those
swooping around. All right, ride!

75
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
Give me a hand, will you?
OK, you too.

76
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,520
I don't blow on man's hands.

77
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,960
There it is! It's the Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...

78
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,720
That's what happens.

79
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,000
Worse things have happened,
I think we're gonna be fine.

80
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,840
Color me up, will you?
- This is where I exit.

81
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,000
- Tomorrow don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it.

82
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,640
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.

83
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
Render unto Caesar that which
is Caesar's. There you go.

84
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,400
Mr. Stark! Excuse me!
Mr. Stark!

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,840
Christine Everheart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

86
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,600
Can I ask you a couple of
questions? - She's cute.

87
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,680
- She's alright? Hi.
- Hi.

88
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,440
Yeah. Okay, go.

89
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,400
You've been called the Da Vinci of
our time. What do you say to that?

90
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,240
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.

91
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,320
And what do you say to your other
nickname, the Merchant of Death?

92
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,000
That's not bad.
Let me guess... Berkeley?

93
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,520
Brown, actually.

94
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,440
Well, Ms. Brown.

95
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,160
It's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

96
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,800
I guarantee you the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,080
we'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.

98
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
Rehearse that much?

99
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.

100
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.

101
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,320
All I want is the serious answer.

102
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,440
Okay, here is serious.
My old man had a philosophy:

103
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,080
"Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."

104
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,240
That's a great line, coming
from a guy selling the sticks.

105
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,000
My father helped defeat Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

106
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,320
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,

107
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,840
would call that being a hero.

108
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,960
And a lot of people would
also call that war-profiteering.

109
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,480
Tell me, do you plan to report

110
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,080
on the millions we've saved by
advancing medical technology?

111
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,640
Or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

112
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,920
All those breakthroughs:
military funding, honey.

113
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,200
Wow, did you ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?

114
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,880
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.

115
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,200
Good morning. It's 7 a.m.

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,680
The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.

117
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,600
The surf conditions are fair
with waist to shoulder highlines,

118
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,440
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,080
Tony? Hey, Tony!

120
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,160
You are not authorized to
access this area. - Jesus!

121
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
That's Jarvis, he runs the house.

122
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,280
I've got your clothes here, they've
been dry cleaned and pressed.

123
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,400
And there's a car
waiting for you outside

124
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,520
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.

125
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,440
You must be the famous
Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.

126
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,040
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry cleaning?

127
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,520
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires.

128
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
Including occasionally taking out
the trash. Would that be all?

129
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,680
Give me the exploded view.

130
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,520
The compression in cylinder 3
appears to be low.

131
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,920
Note that.

132
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
- I'll try again later...
- Please don't turn down my music.

133
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll keep you posted.

134
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
You are supposed to be half way
around the world right now.

135
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,920
- How did she take it?
- Like a champ.

136
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,520
Might've tried to
hustle me out of here.

137
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,440
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.

138
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
That's funny... I thought with
it being my plane and all,

139
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,800
that it would just wait
for me to get there.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,320
I need to speak to you about couple of
things before I get you outta the door.

141
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,000
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the
purpose of having your own plane

142
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,440
if it departs before you arrive?

143
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,120
Larry called, he's got another
buyer for the Jackson Pollock

144
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,360
in the wings, do you
want it, yes or no?

145
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,960
Is it a good representation
of his Spring Period?

146
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,480
No the "Springs" is actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton,

147
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,160
where he lived and worked,
not "spring" like the season.

148
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,280
I think it's a fair example...

149
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,960
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

150
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,560
I need it. Buy it, store it.

151
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,760
Okay... the MIT
commencement speech.

152
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,120
Is in June... please, don't
harangue me about that stuff.

153
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,960
Well, they are haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes...

154
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,720
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

155
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,760
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?

156
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,360
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

157
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,480
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.

158
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,720
It's your birthday. - Yes.
- I knew that. Already?

159
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,960
Yeah, isn't that strange,
it's the same day as last year.

160
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Well, get yourself something
nice from me. - I already did.

161
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,680
- And?
- Oh, it was very nice.

162
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,480
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

163
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.

164
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,280
You're good! I thought
I've lost you back there.

165
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,400
You did, sir.

166
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,760
I took it across Mojave.
- Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha.

167
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,080
What's wrong with you?
- What?

168
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,800
Three hours! - I got caught
doing a piece for Vanity Fair.

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,120
Three hours. For three hours,
you got me standing here.

170
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,880
I'm waiting on you now.
Lets go. C'mon.

171
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,400
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

172
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,120
What're you reading?
- Nothing.

173
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,480
C'mon, sourpatch,
don't be mad.

174
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,040
I told you I'm not mad,
I'm indifferent, okay?

175
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,960
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

176
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,920
- No need to apologize.
- I told him I was sorry but he...

177
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,440
I'm just indifferent right now.

178
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,000
You don't respect yourself,
so I know you don't respect me.

179
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,560
- I respect you.
- I'm just your babysitter,

180
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
and so, when you need your
diaper changed, thank you...

181
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,920
let me know and I'll
get you a bottle, okay?

182
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,480
Hey, heat up the sake, will you?
Thanks for reminding me.

183
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,080
I'm not talking... we're not drinking,
we're working right now.

184
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,600
And you are constitutionally
incapable of being responsible.

185
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,360
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.

186
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,280
I'm just talking about
the night cup. - Hot sake?

187
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,760
- Yes, two please.
- No, just...

188
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,880
I'm not drinking,
I don't want any.

189
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,800
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning,

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,800
and I'm putting on my uniform,
you know what I recognize?

191
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,720
I see in that mirror that every
person that's got this uniform

192
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,080
will get my back! - Here we
go again. I'm not like you.

193
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,560
No, you don't have to be like me.
But you're more than... yes you are.

194
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,560
Will you excuse me,
I'm a little bit distracted here.

195
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,840
No, you can't be distracted
right now. Listen to me!

196
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,400
BAGRAM AIR BASE,
AFGHANISTAN

197
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,360
General.

198
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
Welcome, Mr. Stark.

199
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,200
We look forward to your
weapons presentation.

200
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,280
Is it better to be feared
or respected?

201
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,760
And I say, is it too much
to ask for both?

202
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,200
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel

203
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,080
of Stark Industries freedom line.
It's the first missile system

204
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,080
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

205
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,880
They say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.

206
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,960
I respectfully disagree.

207
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,880
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.

208
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,640
That's how dad did it,
that's how America does it...

209
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,040
and it's worked out
pretty well so far.

210
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,800
Find an excuse to let
one of these off the chain,

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,640
and I personally guarantee you

212
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,920
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

213
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,520
For your consideration,
the Jericho.

214
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,760
We throw one of these in with every
purchase of 500 million or more.

215
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,400
To peace!

216
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,080
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

217
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,520
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How did it go?

218
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,840
Went great, looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.

219
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,960
Hey, way to go, my boy.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

220
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,040
Why aren't you wearing
those pyjamas I got you?

221
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,680
Good night, Tony.

222
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,840
Hey Tony!

223
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.
The hum-drum-vee is back there.

224
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,040
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

225
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,160
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

226
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,560
What the hell did you do to me?

227
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,800
What I did?

228
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,000
What I did is to save your life.

229
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,480
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

230
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,080
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.

231
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
Here, wanna see?

232
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,240
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.

233
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,040
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.

234
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
We call them the walking dead.

235
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,440
Because in takes about a week for
the balls to reach the vital organs.

236
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,480
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet.

237
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,920
Hooked up to a car battery.

238
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,440
And it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

239
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,040
That's right. Smile!

240
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,960
We met once, you know.

241
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,320
At the technical
conference in Bern.

242
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,240
- Don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

243
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,640
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

244
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,760
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

245
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,720
Where are we?

246
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,080
Come on, stand up.
Stand up.

247
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
Do as I do.

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,920
C'mon, put your hands up.

249
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,840
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

250
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,960
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.

251
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,600
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark,

252
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,280
the most famous mass murderer
in the history of America."

253
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,160
He is honored.

254
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,800
He wants you to build a missile.

255
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,000
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

256
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,880
This one.

257
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,840
I refuse.

258
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,600
Tony!

259
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,920
He wants to know
what you think.

260
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,960
I think he got a lot
of my weapons.

261
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,000
He says they have everything you
need to build a Jericho missile.

262
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,960
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

263
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
He says for you to start
working immediately,

264
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,080
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

265
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,200
No, I won't.

266
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,840
No, he won't.

267
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.

268
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,880
But they will never find
you in these mountains.

269
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,640
Look...

270
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,560
What you just saw...
that is your legacy, Stark.

271
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,400
Your life's work in the
hands of those murderers.

272
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,760
Is that how you want to go out?

273
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,080
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

274
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,840
Or are you going to do
something about it?

275
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,920
Why should I do anything?
They're gonna kill me, you...

276
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Either way, if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

277
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,680
Well then... this is a very
important week for you, isn't it?

278
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
If this is gonna be my workstation,

279
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
I want it well lit,
I want all of these tools.

280
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,240
Welding gear, I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.

281
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,280
I need a soldering station,
I need helmets,

282
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,320
I need goggles,
I would like a smelting cup.

283
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,760
I need two sets
of precision tools.

284
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,320
How many languages do you speak?

285
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,440
A lot. But apparently
not enough for this place.

286
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,920
They speak Arabic,
Urdu, Dari, Pashto,

287
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,400
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

288
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,320
Who are these people?

289
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,480
They are your loyal
customers, sir.

290
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
They call themselves
The Ten Rings.

291
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,920
You know, we might
be more productive

292
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,000
if you include me in the
planning process? - Aha.

293
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,240
Okay. We don't need this.

294
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,640
What is that?

295
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,560
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.
We need at least 1.6,

296
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,640
so why don't you go break
down the other eleven.

297
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,480
What are they doing?

298
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,600
Working.

299
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,960
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.

300
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,680
Relax, I've steady hands.

301
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,960
Why do you think
you're still alive, huh?

302
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,840
What do I call you?

303
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,560
- My name is Yinsen.
- Yinsen... nice to meet you.

304
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,560
Nice to meet you too.

305
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,160
Wow, that doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.

306
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,120
That's because it is a
miniaturized Arc reactor.

307
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,520
We got a big one powering
my factory at home.

308
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,400
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

309
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,320
But what could it generate?

310
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,000
If my math is right,
and it always is...

311
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,040
three gigajoules per second.

312
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,720
That could run your heart
for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah.

313
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,200
Or something big for 50 minutes.

314
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,000
This is our ticket outta here.
- What is it?

315
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,200
'Flying the mountain' look.

316
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,240
Impressive.

317
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,120
Shesh Besh.

318
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,160
Good roll.
Good roll.

319
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,480
You still didn't tell me
where you're from.

320
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,080
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.

321
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,480
It's actually a nice place.

322
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,080
- You got a family?
- Yes.

323
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,600
And I will see them
when I leave here.

324
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,720
And you, Stark?

325
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Nothing.

326
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
No.

327
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,320
So you're a man who has
everything... and nothing.

328
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,040
Doesn't look anything
like the photo.

329
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,880
Maybe he modified it.

330
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,960
- The tail doesn't seem right.
- Well, too bad.

331
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,640
Relax.

332
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,000
The bow and arrow once was the
pinnacle of weapons technology.

333
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,960
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

334
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,320
to rule from the Pacific
to the Ukraine.

335
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,160
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great.

336
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,720
And four times the size
of the Roman empire.

337
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,400
But today,

338
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,000
whoever holds the latest
Stark weapons,

339
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,840
rules these lands.

340
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,840
And soon...

341
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,920
...it will be my turn.

342
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,120
Why did you fail me?

343
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
We're working on it.
Diligently.

344
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
I spared your life.

345
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,960
Is this how you repay me?

346
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,760
It's very complex.

347
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,200
We're trying hard.

348
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,320
On your knees.

349
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,040
You think I'm an idiot?

350
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,960
Tell me the truth.

351
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
We are working hard.

352
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,280
Open your mouth.

353
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,360
- What does he want?
- You think I'm a fool?

354
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,760
What is going on?

355
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,200
Tell me the truth.

356
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,360
We are working on Jericho.

357
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,040
What do you want,
a delivery date?

358
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,560
I need him.

359
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,720
He's a good assistant.

360
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,760
You have till tomorrow...

361
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,000
...to assemble my missile.

362
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,040
- Okay?
- Yes.

363
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,480
Can you move?

364
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,160
Say it again.

365
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,120
41 steps straight ahead,

366
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,400
then 16 steps, left from
the door, four to the right.

367
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,320
33 steps, turn right.

368
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,920
Where is Stark?

369
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,960
He was here a moment ago.

370
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,480
Go find him!

371
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,040
Yinsen!

372
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,560
Yinsen!
Stark!

373
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,160
Say something.

374
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,200
He is speaking Hungarian,
I don't...

375
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,120
- Speak Hungarian.
- Okay...

376
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,920
What do you know?

377
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,160
- How did that work?
- Oh my goodness.

378
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,120
- It worked all right.
- What do I do?

379
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,920
- Let me finish this.
- Finish last powering sequence.

380
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,200
Okay.

381
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,480
Now! Tell me, tell me!

382
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,240
F 11. Tell me when you
see a progress bar.

383
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,080
It should be up right now.

384
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,200
Talk to me, tell me when
you see it. - I have it.

385
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,640
- Press Ctrl + I.
- Got it.

386
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,760
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over
here and button me up.

387
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
They are coming!

388
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,160
Doesn't need to look pretty,
just get it done.

389
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,760
They are coming.

390
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,760
Make sure that checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, OK?

391
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,360
We need more time.

392
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,400
Okay.

393
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,640
I'm gonna go
buy you some time.

394
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,160
Stick to the plan!

395
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,760
Stick to the plan!

396
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,520
Yinsen!

397
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,840
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

398
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,760
Stark.

399
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,960
Come on. We gotta go.

400
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,720
Move with me. C'mon, we got
a plan, we need to stick to it.

401
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,640
This was always the plan, Stark.

402
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,720
Come on, you're going to
go see your family again.

403
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,000
My family is dead.

404
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,480
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

405
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,800
It's okay.
It's okay.

406
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,760
I want this.
I want this.

407
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,480
Thank you for saving me.

408
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,920
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.

409
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,280
My turn.

410
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,840
Not bad.

411
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,800
How was the fun-vee?

412
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,920
Next time you ride with me, okay?

413
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,400
Watch it coming up here.

414
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,760
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

415
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,960
Your eyes are red.

416
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,880
Few tears for your
long lost boss?

417
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,800
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.

418
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Yeah, vacation's over.

419
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,080
Where to, sir?

420
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,760
Take us to the hospital, please.
- No. - No? Tony...

421
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,480
- You have to go to the hospital.
- I don't have to do anything.

422
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,200
I was in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do.

423
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,520
I want an American cheeseburger...

424
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,520
...and the other one...
- That's not going to happen.

425
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,880
It's not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

426
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,040
Call for a press conference?
What on earth for?

427
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,160
Yeah, Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.

428
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,200
Look at this!

429
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,000
Tony!

430
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,280
I thought you'll be
in a hospital.

431
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,480
Look at you!

432
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,880
Oh, burger, you had
to have a burger.

433
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,520
Did you get me one of those?

434
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,640
There was only one left,
I needed it.

435
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,600
Hey, look who's here!

436
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,880
- Ms. Potts?
- Yes.

437
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,520
May I speak with you
for a moment?

438
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,480
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

439
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,840
I am not a reporter.
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

440
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,920
with the Strategic
Homeland Intervention,

441
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,840
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.

442
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,720
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

443
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,760
We've been approached
already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...

444
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,360
We are a separate division.
With a more specific focus.

445
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,640
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.

446
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,640
- I'll put something in a book,
shell I? - Thank you.

447
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,560
Hey, would it be alright
if everyone sat down?

448
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,640
Will you sit down? That way
you can see me, and I can...

449
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,880
A little less formal...

450
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,160
What's up with the lovin'?

451
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,760
Don't look at me,
I don't know what he's up to.

452
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,480
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

453
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,080
I never got to say
goodbye to dad.

454
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,920
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.

455
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,360
There's questions that
I would've asked him.

456
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,680
I would've asked him how he felt
about what his company did...

457
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,920
...if he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

458
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,520
Or maybe he was every inch of a man
we all remember from the newsreels.

459
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,720
I saw young Americans killed...

460
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,240
...by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

461
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,520
And I saw that I had
become part of a system

462
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,920
that is comfortable with
zero-accountability.

463
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,720
What happened over there?

464
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,960
I had my eyes opened.

465
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,280
I came to realize that
I have more to offer

466
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,400
this world than just making
things that blow up.

467
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,720
And that is why, effective
immediately, I'm shutting down

468
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,120
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International...

469
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,920
...untill such a time,
as I can decide

470
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,040
what the future of
this company will be,

471
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,800
what direction it should take,
the one I'm comfortable with,

472
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,680
and is consistent with the highest
good of this country and the world.

473
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,680
What we should
take away from this...

474
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,760
...is that Tony's back!

475
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,480
And he's healthier than ever.

476
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,840
We are gonna have a little
internal discussion

477
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,760
and we'll get back to
you with a follow-up.

478
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,480
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

479
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,400
That... that went well.

480
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,000
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

481
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,080
Your head?
What about my head?

482
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,400
What do you think the over-under
on a stock drop is gonna be?

483
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,480
- Optimistically? 40 Points?
- At minimum.

484
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,800
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.

485
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,560
Obie, I just... I don't want
the body count to be up...

486
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,400
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers, we make weapons.

487
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,320
My name is on facade
of the building.

488
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,520
What we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.

489
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,320
Not based on what I saw.

490
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,240
We're not doing a
good enough job.

491
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,960
We can do better, we're
gonna do something else.

492
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,800
Oh, like what? You want us
to make baby bottles?

493
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,760
I think we should take another
look into Arc Reactor technology.

494
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,400
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!

495
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,840
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

496
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,120
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

497
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,920
The Arc was never cost-effective.
We knew that before we built it.

498
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,760
Arc Reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

499
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,840
- Maybe.
- Am I right?

500
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,760
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that, in what... 30 years.

501
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,840
That's what they say.

502
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,480
Could you have a
lousier poker face?

503
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,800
Just tell me, who told you?
- Never mind who told me.

504
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,480
- Show me.
- Rhodey or Pepper.

505
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,560
- I wanna see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

506
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,640
It works.

507
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,240
Listen to me, Tony.

508
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,400
We are a team,
do you understand?

509
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,000
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

510
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,760
like your father and I.

511
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,680
I'm sorry I didn't give you a
heads up, okay? But if I had...

512
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,320
Tony, no more of this
'ready - fire - aim' business.

513
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,040
- Do you understand me?
- That was dad's line.

514
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,480
You gotta let me handle this.

515
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,960
We're gonna have to play whole
different kind of ball now.

516
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,880
We're gonna have to
take a lot of heat.

517
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,040
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

518
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,600
<i>Stark Industries. I've got one
recommendation. Ready, ready?</i>

519
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,520
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

520
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,440
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

521
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,560
<i>Does the 'Hindenburg'
ring any bells?</i>

522
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,920
<i>Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!</i>

523
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,760
<i>Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>

524
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,160
Pepper!
How big are your hands?

525
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,760
- What?
- How big are your hands?

526
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,680
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

527
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,680
Hey!

528
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,480
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.

529
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,120
Let's see them.

530
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,120
Oh, wow, they are small.
Very petite, indeed.

531
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,640
I just need your
help for a sec.

532
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,800
Oh my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

533
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,120
It was, it is now an antique.

534
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,520
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.

535
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,640
I was swapping it up
for an upgraded unit

536
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,080
and I just ran into a
little... speed bump.

537
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,720
Speed bump?
What's happening?

538
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,440
It's nothing,
it's just a little snag.

539
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,920
There's an exposed wire
under this device

540
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,720
and is contacting a socket wall

541
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,840
and is causing a little
bit of a short circuit.

542
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,960
What do you want me to do?

543
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,520
Put that on the table over
there. That is irrelevant.

544
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,120
I just want you to reach in...

545
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,720
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.

546
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,680
Is it safe?

547
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,640
Yeah, it should be fine.
It's just like an operation,

548
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,240
you just don't let it
touch the socket wall.

549
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,040
- What's Operation?
- It's just a game, never mind.

550
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,720
- Just gently lift the wire.
- Okay. - Okay? Great.

551
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,160
You know, I don't think
that I am qualified to do this.

552
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,800
No, no, you're fine.
You're the most capable,

553
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,960
qualified and trustworthy
person I've ever met.

554
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,880
You're gonna do great.

555
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,160
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
Cause I really need your help here.

556
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,640
- Oh, there's pus!
- It's not pus.

557
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,400
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from
the device, not from my body.

558
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,680
- It smells!
- Yeah, it does.

559
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,880
The copper wire.

560
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,240
The copper wire, you got it?
- I got it.

561
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,800
Now don't let it touch...

562
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,120
...the sides, that's what I was
trying to tell you before.

563
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,240
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out,

564
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,640
you don't pull out the magnet
and the end of it. That was it...

565
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,720
...that you just pulled out.
- Oh God. OK, what do I do?

566
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,920
- Don't put it back in!
- What's wrong?

567
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,120
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac
arrest cause you yanked out...

568
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,400
- What? I thought you said this
was safe! - We gotta hurry.

569
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,760
Take this, you gotta switch,
real quick. - Okay, okay.

570
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,160
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna make this okay.

571
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,840
You gotta touch
that to base plate.

572
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,760
And make sure you...

573
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,720
Was that so hard?

574
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,240
That was fun, right?
I got it, I got it.

575
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,840
Nice.

576
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,080
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

577
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,840
Are you okay?

578
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,240
Don't ever, ever...

579
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,280
...ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.

580
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,000
I don't have anyone but you.

581
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,360
Are we ready?

582
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,640
What do you want me
to do with this?

583
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,560
That? Destroy it.
Incinerate it.

584
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,680
You don't wanna keep it?

585
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,600
Pepper, I've been
called many things.

586
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,520
Nostalgic is not one of them.

587
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,520
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That would be all, Ms. Potts.

588
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,960
Hey butterfingers, come here.

589
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,240
What's all this stuff doing
on top of my desk?

590
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,840
That's my phone, that's
a picture of me and my dad...

591
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,920
Right there. In garbage.
All that stuff.

592
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,880
The future of air combat.

593
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,240
Is it manned or unmanned?

594
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,240
I tell you, in my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle

595
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,120
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,

596
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,400
his insight - that ability
to look into a situation

597
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,400
beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome.

598
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,120
Or pilot's judgement.

599
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,840
Colonel, it's... why not
a pilot without a plane?

600
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,320
Look who fell outta the sky!
Mr. Tony Stark.

601
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,960
Speaking about manned
or unmanned,

602
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,680
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong.

603
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,280
It's spring break,
just remember that.

604
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,760
Spring break 1987, that lovely
lady, what was his name?

605
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,120
Was it Ivan?

606
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,600
Don't do that, they'll believe it.
Don't do that.

607
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,360
Give us a couple
of minutes, you guys.

608
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,960
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

609
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,600
I swear I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.

610
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,680
I'm doing a little
better than walking.

611
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,240
- Really?
- Yeah.

612
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,160
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.

613
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,480
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be part of it.

614
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,640
You're about to make a whole lotta
people around here real happy,

615
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,320
cause that little stunt at the
press conference, that was juicy.

616
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,960
This is not for the military.
I'm not... it's different.

617
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,840
What, are you humanitarian
now or something?

618
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,680
I need you to listen to me.

619
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,160
No, what you need is time
to get your mind right.

620
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,400
I'm serious.

621
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,880
It was nice seeing you, Tony.

622
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,680
Thanks.

623
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,360
- Jarvis, are you up?
- For you sir, always.

624
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,200
I'd like to open a new
project file, index as: Mark 2.

625
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,720
Shell I store this on the Stark
Industries' central database?

626
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,920
I don't know who to trust
right now. Till further notice,

627
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,640
why don't we just keep everything
on my private server.

628
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,400
Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?

629
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,480
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.

630
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,560
Maybe in mine it could
actually do some good.

631
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,880
Next.

632
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,000
Up.

633
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,840
Not the boot, Dummy, right here.
You got me?

634
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,840
Stay put. Nice.

635
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,040
And you, you're no better
at it at all. Lift... I got it.

636
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,760
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?

637
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,240
Up.

638
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,720
That's great, don't even move.

639
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,520
You... are a tragedy.

640
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,760
Okay, lets do this right.

641
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Start mark, half meter
back of the center.

642
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,160
Dummy, look for light.
Stand back for fire safety.

643
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,080
You, roll it.

644
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,160
Activate hand controls.

645
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,120
We are gonna start up
nice and easy,

646
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,440
raising 10% thrust capacity
to achieve lift.

647
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,760
And 3, 2, 1.

648
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,640
Up two? Alright, step back.

649
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,880
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

650
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,600
Yeah, everything's... what?

651
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,640
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great, I'll be right up.

652
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,200
I thought you said you were
done making weapons?

653
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,120
It isn't. This is
a flight stabilizer.

654
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,120
It's completely harmless.

655
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,680
I didn't expect that.

656
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,680
How'd it go?

657
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,520
Oh, went that bad huh?

658
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,200
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York

659
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,480
doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

660
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,920
It would've gone better
if you were there.

661
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,120
You told me to lay low and
that's what I've been doing.

662
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,880
I lay low and you
take care of all the...

663
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,000
Hey, c'mon.
In public, the press...

664
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,680
This was a Board of
Directors meeting.

665
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,240
This was a Board of
Directors meeting?

666
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,960
The Board is claiming
a Post Traumatic Stress.

667
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
They are filing an injunction.
- A what?

668
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,680
They wanna lock you out.

669
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,840
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points?
We knew this was gonna happen.

670
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,960
- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

671
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,160
We own a controlling
interest in the company.

672
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,800
Tony, the Board has rights too.

673
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,760
They are making the case that
you and your new direction

674
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,720
isn't in a company's
best interest.

675
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,920
I'm being responsible.
That's a new direction.

676
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,880
For me... for the company.

677
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,720
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

678
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,200
- Oh, this is great!
- Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!

679
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,360
- I'll be in the shop.
- Hey, hey, Tony, listen.

680
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,560
I'm trying to turn
this thing around,

681
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,600
but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them.

682
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,240
Let me have the engineers
analyze that, you know,

683
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,160
draw some specs.
- No.

684
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,320
No. Absolutely not.
This one stays with me.

685
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,160
That's it Obie.
Forget it.

686
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,720
Alright, well this
stays with me then.

687
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,600
Go on, here, you can have
a piece. Take two. - Thank you.

688
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,120
Do you mind if I come down there
to see what you're doing?

689
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,640
Good night, Obie.

690
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,960
Day 11, Test 37,
Configuration 2.0.

691
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,880
For lack of a better option,
Dummy is still on fire safety.

692
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,600
If you douse me again,
and I'm not on fire,

693
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,600
I'm donating you to a city college.
Alright, nice and easy.

694
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,320
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

695
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,760
And 3, 2, 1.

696
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,840
Please don't follow me around
with it either cause I feel

697
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,360
like I'm going to catch on fire
spontaneously. Just stand down.

698
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,160
If something happens,
then come in.

699
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,400
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%.
3, 2, 1...

700
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,080
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be.

701
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,600
Not the car,
not the car.

702
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,800
It could be worse.
We are fine.

703
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,800
Okay, we are getting there.

704
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,480
Yeah. I can fly.

705
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,000
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

706
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,680
Engage head up display.
Check.

707
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,200
Import all preferences
from home interface.

708
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,720
Will do, sir.

709
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,400
Alright, what do you say?

710
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,080
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.

711
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,040
Start the virtual walkaround.

712
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,920
Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.

713
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,880
- Do a check on control surfaces.
- As you wish.

714
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,800
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

715
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,320
Ah, yes... tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

716
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,960
Start listening
the ground control.

717
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,560
Sir, there are still terabytes
of calculations needed

718
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,640
before an actual flight.
- Jarvis...

719
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,360
Sometimes you gotta run
before you can walk.

720
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,200
Ready? And 3, 2, 1.

721
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,680
It feels like a dream.

722
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:19,930
