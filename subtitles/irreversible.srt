2
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,880
Shall I tell you something?

3
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,720
Time ruins everything.

4
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,200
I just made that up.

5
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,480
What happened to you?

6
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,640
I will tell you.

7
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,960
I spent some time in prison
because...

8
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,880
because I had sex with my daughter.

9
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,440
The western syndrome.

10
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,880
I think about it all the time.

11
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,440
It was everything I had left,
I had nothing else.

12
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,040
I never had anything.

13
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
It was cute.

14
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,760
Easy now.

15
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
We`re all... mefisto`s.

16
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,600
I want to bring you some fun.

17
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,000
Guys who fool around a bit and
then hear it`s something bad.

18
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,600
That it`s dramatic.

19
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,440
But you can`t forget the joy
and the happiness.

20
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,120
There are no...

21
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,240
There are no crimes,
only actions.

22
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,840
I have to start over.

23
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,960
I have to quit, I have to live.

24
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,280
Keep on fighting, staying alive.

25
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,200
I understand you completely.
Do you have something to drink?

26
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,840
No, I don¢¥t have anything to drink.

27
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,480
I have no penny.
Oh what...

28
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,120
What¢¥s that noise outside?

29
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,920
Nothing.

30
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,320
The assholes from downstairs.

31
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
They give their usual show
in the Rectum.

32
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,480
Right.
- Rectum!

33
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,480
What kind of crime?
- With blood.

34
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,280
Blood? Does someone have
her period or something?

35
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
May I wait here for a while?

36
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,000
They still owe me money.
WHat happened?

37
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,480
I told you those bastards
wouldn`t pay.

38
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,200
Step aside please.

39
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,760
Morad, check out that guys
fucked up face.

40
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,080
Is your leg fucked up, pal?

41
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,320
Your ass too, I hope.

42
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,400
Like Alex. I hope you bleed a lot.
And that you`re in a lot of pain.

43
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,920
His asshole must have
bled a lot.

44
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,240
Fucker. Fag.

45
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,600
Because of those two guys
the fuckers got us.

46
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,800
They will be happy in the street.

47
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,720
But I want my money.

48
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,480
Why are we still standing here?
We`ll get our money or go.

49
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Fucking fags.
There are gays all over here.

50
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,560
It`s god damn impossible,
they are everywhere.

51
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,680
Clear the path.

52
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,760
Get rid of that asshole.

53
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,960
And cuff him.

54
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,080
They will fuck him in the
ass in prison.

55
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,080
I`m waiting for my money.
- Move it.

56
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,800
I hope you`ll be miserable in jail
and that they fuck you in the ass.

57
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,520
Fucking history and philosophy
teacher.

58
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,240
Fuscking moron.
- All philosophers are fags.

59
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,560
I hope they get you hard.

60
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,520
To the station.
- In prison there are no condoms.

61
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,240
You`ll get aids straigh away, fag.

62
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,680
What are you doing?
- I`m looking for The Tapeworm.

63
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,640
You have to pay.
- I`m already paying.

64
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,280
Go ahead.

65
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,600
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

66
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,600
We`ll find him,
we`ll find him.

67
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,280
You`re not human anymore. Even animals
don`t revenge themselves, Marcus.

68
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,760
It`s going totally wrong.

69
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,520
Leave me alone.
- You won`t survive.

70
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,040
It`s none of your business.
- It smells like shit here.

71
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,920
Quit it, Marcus.

72
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,120
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
- No.

73
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,080
Marcus, come back!
I won`t save you.

74
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,760
Marcus, stop it now.

75
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,560
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
- No.

76
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,000
Pierre!

77
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,560
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

78
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you know The Tapeworm?

79
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,800
The Tapeworm?

80
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,200
Pierre!

81
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,080
It goes on downstairs.
We`re going once.

82
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,280
We`re going down once.
Come on, one time. Help me, Pierre.

83
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,080
Do you know The Tapeworm?

84
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,240
Why are you smiling?

85
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,880
The Tapeworm...
Do you know The Tapeworm? No?

86
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,320
let me go! Don`t you know him?

87
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,640
Do you know The Tapeworm?
- Do you want to suck my cock?

88
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,320
No.
Do you know where The Tapeworm is?

89
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

90
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,920
Do you want to suck my dick?

91
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,440
Come back. You want to fuck?

92
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,080
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
He`s here often.

93
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,520
Maybe upstairs.

94
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,400
The Tapeworm...
Are you The Tapeworm?

95
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,280
Let me go.
Do you know The Tapeworm?

96
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,960
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm? He`s here often.
- Doesn`t ring a bell.

97
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,560
Do you work here often?
- Yes, but it doesn`t ring a bell.

98
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,640
Don`t you know him either?
- Search. You won`t find him far from here.

99
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,840
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

100
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,520
The Tapeworm? No.

101
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,520
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

102
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,240
Do you know The Tapeworm?
- I have him in my stomach.

103
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,280
Do you know The Tapeworm?

104
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,920
You there. Do you know The Tapeworm?

105
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,760
Yes, he`s my pal.
- You know him?

106
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,600
He`s my friend, I said.
- Where is he?

107
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,200
Take me to him.
- He`s fucking a fag.

108
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,040
Forget The Tapeworm. Fist me.
- Don`t touch me.

109
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,960
Come on fist me.
- Keep your hands off me.

110
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,360
Shut up. Take me to him.
- Fist me.

111
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,480
Fist me then!
- Take me to him.

112
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,520
Fist me! What kind of guy are you?

113
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,800
Keep quiet! I`m not a fag.

114
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,640
Where is he? Come on.
- I`ll take you to The Tapeworm.

115
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,080
Take me to him!
- Two hands up your ass!

116
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,040
Stop it.

117
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,600
Are you sure you want
to see The Tapeworm?

118
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,080
Fist me, that`s much better.

119
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,080
Are you sure you want to see
him? Fisting me is much better.

120
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,240
I like you.
You make me think about someone else.

121
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,120
Take me to him, I said.
Take it easy.

122
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,920
Take me to him. Where is he?

123
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,360
Give me a drink.
- Give him a drink.

124
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,920
Drink! Where is he?

125
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,200
One Pepsi.
- Where is he?

126
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
The Tapeworm? In your ass.
The Tapeworm is in your ass. You know?

127
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,680
You want my fist against your yaw,
fucking fag?

128
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,640
Where is he? I know him.

129
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,640
I know him. Bring me to him.

130
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,080
Damned parachutist.
- Take me to him.

131
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,240
You should fuck their brains out.
Show them you`re a hero.

132
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,080
Dammit, is that what you want?
Take me to him.

133
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,000
Take me to him!
- I confess!

134
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,280
Take me to him!
- I confess!

135
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,160
Take me to him!
- I confess, dammit!

136
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,160
Go on! Go on!
Where is he?

137
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,080
Hurry up dammit!
- The Tapeworm is dangerous.

138
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,000
Are you sure you want to see
The Tapeworm?

139
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
Hit me one more time.

140
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
Where is he?
- There he is.

141
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,640
Fuck off.

142
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,440
What`s happening?
- Who`s The Tapeworm here?

143
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,080
Are you The Tapeworm?
I asked you something.

144
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,600
Who`s The Tapeworm?

145
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,560
Who`s The Tapeworm?

146
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,520
Who`s The Tapeworm?
I asked you something. Gone with that.

147
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,560
Who`s The Tapeworm?
You know him?

148
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,560
Who`s The Tapeworm?

149
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,720
Who?
- What do you want from The Tapeworm?

150
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
I¢¥m looking for him.
Are you The Tapeworm perhaps?

151
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,480
Are you him?

152
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,960
Come on, fuck him! Fuck him!

153
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,560
Stop it!

154
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,120
Fucking fag!

155
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,000
Fucking fag!

156
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Stop it!

157
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,880
Nice work. Good.

158
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,480
Fucking slit-eye.

159
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,280
Quit your insanity.
- We`re getting near.

160
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Stop it.
- Wait, I`m asking.

161
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,160
Well, I`m waiting.

162
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,120
Where`s the Rectum?
- Which Rectum?

163
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,080
A fag bar.
- Do you need one?

164
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,720
Is it a whore bar?

165
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,640
Do you want my cock up your rectum?

166
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,800
Don¢¥t you know The Rectum?
- I only know this here.

167
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,600
Aren`t you a fag?

168
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,960
Where`s The Rectum?

169
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,160
What are you doing?

170
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,360
What are you doing?
- Who are you going to hit now?

171
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,360
Come on.
- Yes, I have nothing else to do.

172
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,960
Do you know a place that...

173
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,440
The Rectum, do you know it?

174
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,440
The Rectum, a gay bar.
You know it?

175
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,920
That way, I think.
- There?

176
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,000
It`s over there! Come on!

177
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,840
What are you doing? Come on!

178
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,240
We`re close!

179
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,680
Are you coming?

180
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,280
Come on!
- Stop it!

181
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,440
Are you being pussy too now?

182
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,360
You`re crazy!
- We¢¥re going to The rectum! Come on!

183
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,600
Hurry up.

184
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,400
Drive!

185
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,320
Who`s followinf you?
- Drive, I said!

186
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,600
Are the whore`s after you?

187
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,400
You`re not even telling where to,

188
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,600
We`re going to The Rectum!
- The Rectum! That`s clear.

189
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
Everyone knows where The rectum is.

190
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,200
Could you show the way, please?

191
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,080
It`s a gay bar.

192
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,160
If you took care of Alex with that much
energy, nothing would have happened.

193
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,520
Picture that with your little
brain, moron.

194
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,120
With your damned inhibitions!

195
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,040
Are you done preaching?
The Rectum is a gay bar.

196
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,440
Could you point it
out on a map?

197
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,320
It`s a fag bar.
Do you know what that is?

198
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,240
Are you gay?
- No! I`m looking for a gay bar.

199
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,520
Don`t you know some bars?

200
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,120
A lot.
- Well, take us to a gay bar.

201
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,680
You are gay.
- No! And now shut up.

202
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,800
Be quiet now and
leave me alone.

203
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,360
Sorry, sir.
- Take us to The Rectum.

204
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,720
Take it easy, marcus.
I`m going crazy here.

205
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,680
I don`t know a Rectum.

206
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,200
Don`t you have a phone?
Cal then!

207
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,680
Don`t you have
slit-eye friends?

208
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,320
Don`t insult me
or I will beat you up.

209
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,880
Bring me to The Rectum.

210
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,040
I will beat him up too, sir.
Don`t take it ill of him.

211
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,440
He`s crazy. It`s a moron.
- Doesn`t matter.

212
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,840
Okay, take it easy. Easy.

213
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,760
One bar with guys.
- Guys?

214
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,320
Try to get your brain working,
fucking asshole.

215
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,200
Take me to The Rectum.
- Get out now.

216
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,560
Shut up and get out.

217
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Just try to get me
out, fucker.

218
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,320
Get out, please.
I am fed up with it.

219
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,240
Alex would be ashamed.
- Get out now. Hurry.

220
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,600
Take it easy, we`re getting out.

221
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,400
get out, I said! Get out!

222
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,400
What do you want
with that pepperspray?

223
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,200
Filthy asshole!
- Get out!

224
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,880
Stop it! Get out, please.
I am fed up with it.

225
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,400
How much do I owe you?

226
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Stop it, Marcus!
Fucking stop it!

227
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,720
Fuck off!

228
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,800
Fuck off! Go on!
- My taxi!

229
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,600
You`re crazy! Stupid fucker!

230
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,240
Drop dead, filthy Chinese.

231
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,400
You`re insane!
- We`re going to The Rectum.

232
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,160
Stop it now with
your stupid revenge.

233
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,280
We`ll pay, we¢¥ll pay.
- Only whore¢¥s are here.

234
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,640
It`s the whore street.
They don¢¥t know anything else.

235
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,800
That¢¥s not your business.
- Stop it! Why, not my business?

236
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,400
Stop it! What, did you want to hit me?

237
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,720
Don¢¥t stay here.
We will give you money.

238
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,240
We¢¥re going to Alex
in the hospital.

239
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,040
Which girl do you know?

240
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,320
What do you want to do?
Being more stupid than...

241
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,240
You don¢¥t know who it was.

242
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,080
Don¢¥t you wnat to know?

243
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,960
Nobody knows who it is.
And you¢¥re not helping Alex with that.

244
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,840
I will give you money.
- Well, who do you know?

245
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
It¢¥s a bit further.
- What will you get with anger?

246
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,520
What kind of crazy
revenge is this?

247
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,440
Come to Alex
in the hospital.

248
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,720
You want to hit me? Is that it?
What¢¥s wrong with you dammit?

249
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,200
Then go to the hospital.

250
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,440
You know those two?
- Ask those whores.

251
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,120
What¢¥s his name?
- Guillermo Nunez.

252
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,800
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?

253
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,800
What?

254
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,440
What does she say?
- Ask the other one.

255
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,920
Donna, I know her.
I meant her.

256
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,080
We deliver better work
than the cops.

257
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,560
Drunkards with a gun.
Zuipschuiten met 'n pistool.

258
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,440
The police, they are morons.
De politie, dat zijn eikels.

259
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,480
What do you know, teacher?

260
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,720
The human stupidity,
that¢¥s what I know. In a mass.

261
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,880
Which one is it?
- There.

262
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,560
She?
- Donna!

263
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,280
Stop it!
- I didn¢¥t do anything!

264
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,240
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?
- No.

265
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,880
you don¢¥t know Guillermo Nunez?

266
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,880
He¢¥s my friend.
- You don¢¥t know him?

267
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,160
Nobody knows Guillermo Nunez.

268
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,480
Who is it? Tell me.

269
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,480
What does she say? Concha?
The blonde?

270
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
Thank you, Donna.

271
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,920
Concha, are you Concha?

272
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,000
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?

273
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,840
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?

274
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,640
Keep your hands off her.
Leave her alone.

275
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,400
We won¢¥t do her anything.

276
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,680
Marcus, she didn¢¥t do anything.

277
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,720
Who do you think we are?
- Fuck off.

278
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,040
Are you crazy, Marcus?

279
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,600
Answer me!
It¢¥s about a rape.

280
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
Please!
- Rape, you hear?

281
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,240
Marcus, please!
- Rape!

282
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,480
Are you totally?
- Easy now.

283
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Leave her alone
or I won¢¥t pay.

284
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,480
Take it easy. Stop it, stop it.

285
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,840
Let go!
- I will push!

286
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,280
Come on, dammit. Alex...
- Tell him to stop,

287
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,240
Stop it now, Marcus. Please.

288
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,440
Are you crazy?
You¢¥re fucking insane!

289
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,520
Do you know Guillermo Nunez?
Tell me.

290
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,200
Who is Guillermo Nunez?

291
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,160
Who is Jo? I don¢¥t know a Jo.
- I am Guillemo.

292
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,120
lk ben Guillermo.

293
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,840
You have become a transvestite,
great.

294
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,560
I will pay you now.
- That will tell she was there.

295
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,440
No.
- Did you see it?

296
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,960
Pick up! Go on.

297
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,600
Stop it, Marcus.
- What did you see?

298
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,640
Cut out her eye.
- Come on, stab!

299
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,200
Fuck off, you.
- Tell me.

300
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,280
It¢¥s The Tapeworm. I know him.

301
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,880
The Tapeworm is a pimp.

302
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,520
Where can we find him?

303
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,360
Where? I will rebuild
your transvestite face.

304
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,320
Where is he?
- Where can I find him?

305
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
What¢¥s the name of that club?
- Rectum.

306
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,040
A Tapeworm in The Rectum?
Are you playing me?

307
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,440
It¢¥s a nightclub
for gays.

308
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,720
There¢¥s a taxi!

309
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,880
Taxi!

310
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
Did you use alcohol?

311
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,600
No. No drugs either?

312
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,760
No drugs?

313
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,600
But according to your
so-called colleague...

314
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,040
you used drugs regulary.

315
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,200
He can say whatever he wants.
- Is it true or not?

316
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,400
I didn¢¥t use anything.

317
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,400
And the victim?

318
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,280
I don¢¥t know.
- No? Didn¢¥t you live together?

319
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,720
Did you live together?

320
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,560
Don¢¥t you want to answer?

321
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,920
You don¢¥t make it easy for us.

322
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,000
Did you leave before
or after the victim?

323
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,280
Pull yourself together.
- After, after.

324
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,160
After? how much after?
- 15 minutes.

325
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,560
Now that¢¥s an answer.

326
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,800
15 minutes.

327
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,320
And when did Mr. Marcus
go outside?

328
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,600
He came in the alley with me.

329
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,880
He came in the alley with you.

330
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,360
Did he leave sometime
earlier in the evening?

331
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,280
I don¢¥t know.
- You don¢¥t know?

332
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,880
Did you notice
something special?

333
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,720
Were there people
around the victim?

334
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,560
Did she talk to certain people?
Did she have a fight with someone?

335
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,160
No? With you maybe?

336
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,800
With Mr. Marcus?

337
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,640
And didn¢¥t you have
a fight with Marcus?

338
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,160
You didn¢¥t have a
fight with Mr. Marcus?

339
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,840
I will need a phone number
where I can reach you.

340
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,600
I¢¥m listening

341
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,880
01... 44... 76... 12... 26.

342
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,720
Good. Is that your private number?

343
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,440
Is it your private number?

344
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,440
Give him back his papers.

345
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,040
Take your papers back.

346
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,400
Take your papers.

347
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,960
I will contact you when
I need you. You may go.

348
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,200
Go ahead, it¢¥s allright.
You may go.

349
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,120
Good evening.
Are you allright?

350
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,760
The woman who was attacked...
is she someone you know?

351
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,440
You don¢¥t feel very good, huh?
It¢¥s tough.

352
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,840
You always think it only happens
to other people, but if it happens to you,

353
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,800
you are helplessly lost.

354
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,280
Are you counting on the cops?

355
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,880
What do you think the police
will do? Nothing, and you know that.

356
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,960
Will they find the perpetrator?

357
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,960
Will they put him in jail?

358
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,240
Will they give him food and clothes?
Will they wash him?

359
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,240
Will they give him a doctor?

360
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,320
Your girlfriend didn¢¥t
get a doctor.

361
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,920
Who are you?

362
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,800
Who I am?
As a matter of fact...

363
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,080
I could become your best friend.

364
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,200
I cna help you find the perpetrator.

365
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,800
You look honest.
Nicely dressed.

366
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,160
Obviously you have money.

367
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,680
If you have some money, we could
help you get revenge.

368
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,080
The perpetrator spilled blood.
Blood shouts for revenge.

369
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,040
Revenge is a human right.

370
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Laid, come over.

371
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,520
You understand it right away.
Explain who we are.

372
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,560
This here is our neighbourhood.

373
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,560
We find everyone, faster than
the morons over there.

374
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,560
Exactly.
- Listen to him.

375
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,320
Not very long ago someone
was raped here.

376
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,600
We have found the perpetrator.

377
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,040
We made him clear not to
do it again.

378
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,640
Do you want revenge or not?

379
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,560
Or do you want him to go to prison?

380
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,840
You hesitate?
- Do you know him?

381
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,080
Ofcourse. We found a hand bag
with identity.

382
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,560
The name was Guillermo Nunez.

383
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Are you in?
Pay and we deliver him.

384
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,880
You shouldn¢¥t hesitate.
You¢¥re hurting yourself.

385
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,400
What¢¥s wrong? You¢¥re shivering.

386
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,760
This is only for men.
Don¢¥t be a pussy. Okay?

387
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,160
Are you in or not?
Man yourself.

388
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,920
Take me with you.
- Are you in?

389
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,080
We¢¥ll leave the cops for what they are.
- Come.

390
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,400
Go home then.
- You don¢¥t realize your luck.

391
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,200
Shall I...
- You¢¥re ruining it with Alex.

392
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,360
I¢¥ll give you money for a taxi.

393
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,240
You¢¥re ruining the party
the whole evening.

394
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,080
What¢¥s happening?
- A whore got raped.

395
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,120
You won¢¥t get through
- We want a taxi.

396
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,120
No, gentlemen.
- We only want a taxi.

397
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,000
No, gentlemen.
- Don¢¥t act so stupid.

398
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,400
Something happened,
the street is blocked.

399
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,120
Alex!

400
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
Wait!

401
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,440
Alex! What happened?

402
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,800
Sir, take it easy.
- What happened?

403
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,160
She has been raped and is in a coma now.
Sir, please.

404
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,240
Let us do our work, sir.

405
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,480
Sir, take it easy.
Just let us do our work.

406
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,840
Take him away.
- Sir, please.

407
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,280
We can¢¥t work like that.
- Take him away.

408
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Who are you, sir?

409
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,960
Is she your wife?
- Do you know that man?

410
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,240
I will have to ask you some questions.
Who are you?

411
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,880
She¢¥s my wife.
- Do you know that man?

412
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,840
Sir, please.
- She is my wife.

413
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,200
Keep him on a distance.

414
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,960
It¢¥s dangerous.
Please go around the tunnel.

415
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,120
Thank you.

416
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,840
Here! Filthy bitch.

417
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,360
Filthy bitch, you¢¥re dead.
Hold on, you.

418
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,440
Wait!

419
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,600
Wait!
- Leave me alone.

420
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,560
Wait, I said.

421
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,520
Would you just shut up?
I won¢¥t do you anything.

422
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,440
Shut your fucking mouth.

423
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,520
You want to taste this?

424
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,800
Will you shut up now?

425
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,640
Fucking bitch.

426
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,360
Shall I give you a pretty smile?

427
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,640
Fucking whore.

428
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,000
Does that excite you?
Tell me.

429
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,480
Does it make you horney?

430
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,200
Well, well.

431
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,360
You are pretty hot.

432
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,360
Please...
- Shut up.

433
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,680
Leave me alone
- Shut up, I said.

434
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,600
Lift up your skirt.

435
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,040
Leave me alone.
- Lift up your skirt.

436
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,160
Shut up.

437
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,680
Dammit.
- Leave me alone, please.

438
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,360
Please.

439
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,800
Go sit on your knees.
On your knees!

440
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,960
On your knees! I¢¥m going
to fuck you. On your knees!

441
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,960
And now lie down.

442
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,160
Lie down.

443
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,400
Shut up.

444
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,800
Well, well.

445
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,440
You have a nice ass.

446
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,360
I¢¥m going to fuck you, whore.

447
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,440
Who pays for your clothes?
Your guy?

448
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,560
What an asshole that he lets
you walk around like this outside.

449
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,720
You little whore.

450
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,840
Shut up!
Shut up or I¢¥ll kill you.

451
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,800
Understand?
Shut up or I¢¥ll kill you.

452
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,400
Dammit!

453
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,360
Open your legs! Open your legs!
Open your legs, dammit!

454
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,200
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

455
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,600
Lay still... Don¢¥t move.
I¢¥m going to fuck you in your ass.

456
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,640
I will fuck your ass untill it bleeds!

457
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,920
I will fuck your ass like
you have never fucked.

458
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,680
You little whore.
Don¢¥t move.

459
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,880
You¢¥ve been fucked
in your ass before, huh?

460
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,280
Does your guy do it in your ass?
Do you like it?

461
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,040
Dammit.

462
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,400
Don¢¥t move, dammit!

463
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,280
Lay still, don¢¥t move.

464
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,000
Don¢¥t move, don¢¥t move.

465
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,080
Don¢¥t move, dammit!

466
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,840
Dammit!

467
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,240
You have a nice tight ass.

468
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,480
I will fuck your ass untill it bleeds!

469
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,240
If you dare to shit,
you die. Understand?

470
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,000
Fucking bitch.

471
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,520
You have such a tight ass.

472
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,200
A nice fag ass.

473
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,240
Usually I don¢¥t like that.

474
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,880
Bitch. But this time...

475
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,240
Will you shut up already?

476
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,880
Whore! in your ass!

477
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,360
You¢¥ve never been fucked in
your ass like this, huh?

478
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,840
Dammit, is that blood or cum?

479
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,160
Your ass is getting bigger, huh?
Are you bleeding?

480
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,640
Dammit.

481
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,040
Oh yeah, nice.

482
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,800
Damn, that¢¥s nice.

483
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,800
Tell your daddy it¢¥s nice.

484
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,520
Tell daddy it¢¥s nice.

485
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,000
Say daddy to me.
Say daddy.

486
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,560
Say daddy, bitch!

487
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,640
Shut up!

488
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,840
Dammit.

489
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,240
Dammit... God damnit

490
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,120
Good.

491
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,520
That was nice.

492
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,280
Where are you going, bitch?

493
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,240
WHere are you going?

494
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,080
Where are you going like that?

495
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,760
Did you think I was
done with you?

496
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,960
Little whore.
Look at me.

497
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,600
Look at me when
I¢¥m talking to you.

498
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,080
Look at me, dammit.

499
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,960
Filthy bitch, look at me.

500
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,760
Little whore. Fucking bitch.

501
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,200
Come here!

502
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,520
Ugly bitch!
Bitch!

503
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,840
You think you can do anything, huh?

504
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,120
You think you can do anything
because you're beautiful, huh?

505
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,120
Dirty cunt! Dirty...
Come here!

506
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,480
I'm gonna hit your face real hard!

507
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,960
I'm not finished with you!

508
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,120
Come here! Here! Here!

509
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,520
Fucking bitch! Here!

510
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,400
Are you happy now? Or do you want
some more?

511
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,160
Want some? Fucking whore!
Please!

512
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,520
Little cunt, that you are!
Over here!

513
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,320
This is for your rotten face!

514
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,600
Now I'm all finished with you.
Fucking cunt.

515
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,920
What do you want to say to me?

516
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,080
You do not care about my
sexuality.

517
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,080
But you engage me in it.
-You never talk about yours.

518
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,960
Because there is nothing to tell.

519
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,320
What is it then?
-There is always something.

520
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,880
What are you doing with your dick?

521
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,520
Don't bitch about it.
-Are you gonna keep it to wanking?

522
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,560
Don't be like that. I think about
Alex and you, and that's painful.

523
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,560
You are alone for 3 years now.
-So what?

524
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,480
What do you do?

525
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,080
You are sent by God,
because my pal Pierre...

526
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,880
has a problem.
-What about it?

527
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,120
We must find a way to losen

528
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,600
Pierre a bit up.

529
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,400
I want to take care of that.
-You see...but how?

530
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,960
You are with two
and I'm not alone either.

531
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,520
In the toilets.
-Now shut up.

532
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,000
That's where it happens all the time.
-Alex is alone.

533
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,280
Come on.
-Go, Pierre.

534
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,560
You are saying that I bitch about
your sexuality, and what about you?

535
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,640
Are you afraid?
-Pierre is very nice.

536
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,560
Forget it. I know how it goes.
We make fun,

537
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,160
we get completly stoned...

538
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,320
but I did that 15 years, 30 years ago.

539
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,680
Hello.
-Don't do that.

540
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,160
Stop it, Marcus.
Leave me alone.

541
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,240
You can't do that to Alex.
Leave Fatima alone.

542
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,800
Fatima, come on.

543
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,480
Don't do it. You are going to regret
if you sober up.

544
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,960
Forget about it. Come on.
Go with me.

545
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,960
He's very nice.
First a present.

546
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,680
Don't do that shit.
Leave it.

547
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,920
Stop it, Pierre.

548
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,520
Stop it. Don't do it.

549
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,080
You are a pain in the ass.

550
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,400
And, girls?

551
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,520
Delicious.

552
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,440
I got to go see Pierre

553
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,280
who only loves rats and
may not be left alone.

554
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,480
Are you coming back?

555
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,520
Soon?
-Yeah. Thanks, girls.

556
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,040
Are you going to leave us alone?

557
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,800
This is Pierre
and he needs your love.

558
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,880
Alex is dancing all alone.
Don't be an moron.

559
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,560
Give him some pleasure, ladies.
-Piss off.

560
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,560
You are saying that I bitch about
your sexuality and what do you do?

561
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,040
I know. Come on, Marcus.
I really hate it when you act like that.

562
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,120
If you are not doing it for me,
then do it for her.

563
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,000
No, Marcus stays here.

564
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,800
Come on. Don't be such an idiot.

565
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,520
Alex has to dance all by himself.
Come on.

566
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,000
Leave him.

567
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,120
Here I am!
-Come on.

568
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,360
Marcus, you are fantastic.
-It's rotten, Marcus.

569
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,120
That's life, mate.

570
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,520
Then it didn't have any sense
to bring her along.

571
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,120
Why did you bring her if you
are doing it that way?

572
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,800
Why are you doing it that way?
Come on, have a drink.

573
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,400
You are in need of a glass of water

574
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,520
You don't have to act like that.

575
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,320
You take her with you and...
-Look at the ladies.

576
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,600
You can be a dickhead
without being with her too.

577
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,680
Stay with her.

578
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,960
You need to have some fun.
-Do you call this fun?

579
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,160
Yes, this is fun.
You are just like a priest.

580
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,520
I feel like a nanny.
-Our little priest.

581
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,080
I go with a teenager loaded
with drugs.

582
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,760
Have some water. Come on.

583
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,400
Have a drink.

584
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,280
Here, drink the water. From the sink.

585
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,440
Give me a shot of water from the sink.

586
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,640
There was a queue at the john.
I couldn't piss.

587
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,960
Stop it, Marcus.
-I opened the tap.

588
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,200
Leave it.
-Come on, quit it.

589
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,720
Quit it, Pierre.
Before you fuck up everything.

590
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,000
Come on.
-You are not funny.

591
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,800
It's not funny like that.
They'll see you.

592
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,720
You are even more fierce then an animal.

593
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,720
You are not funny.

594
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,400
Did you come for that, dickhead?
-What, dickhead?

595
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,400
I came to watch them dance,
therefore I'm a dickhead.

596
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,000
Don't be like that, Marcus. Really.

597
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,400
Look how beautiful she is.
Look how she dances.

598
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:24,520
Look how gorgeous. Brunette,
blonde, brunette, blonde.

599
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,080
Behave like an adult.
-We'll fuck'em all.

600
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,880
Found your girlfriends?
-So?

601
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,600
Hello.
- What's your name?

602
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,760
Joanna. Is that you?
- Vincent.

603
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,280
Hello, Vincent.
- No, my name is Marcus.

604
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,720
And you?
- Aurele.

605
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,440
Aurele? This is Alex.

606
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,440
No, that's Alex.
- I know.

607
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,680
I'm Marcus.
Marcus.

608
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,880
Come on.
-I've had it with that cunt.

609
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,280
Don't be so annoying.
-He brings misfortune.

610
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,200
I give him some pussy.
He doesn't want them.

611
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,800
I give him coke, he doesn't like it.

612
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,880
I present him a glass, he says no.
Such a bore.

613
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,520
You picked a weird one as lean
as a lath, Alex.

614
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,400
No, I rather watch you.

615
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,960
I bear heavy secrets.
-Dance with me.

616
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,760
Let me have a look at you.
You didn't use to dance.

617
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,880
There is the hairy monkey.
Stop it, Marcus.

618
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,200
Do something.
What has he swallowed?

619
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,800
Stop it.

620
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,240
In the past you never danced.
-I dance with you.

621
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,080
You dance to forget, huh?
Your Marcus is out of his mind.

622
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,560
What are you doing?
You didn't use to dance like that.

623
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,360
In the past you didn't dance that way.

624
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,480
Let yourself go.
-I'm completly relaxed.

625
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,480
Dance with me.
-You scare me. You're never like this.

626
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,480
I never saw you like this.
There you have got him again.

627
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,680
Do I scare you?
-Funny, huh?

628
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,760
Do you think that's funny?
I can do it too.

629
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,520
Please. Dance with me.

630
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,960
I'm with you. I look at you.

631
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,880
You are in great shape.
Remember? Be careful.

632
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,400
You are playing a dangerous game,
Alex.

633
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,960
Marcus has a lot of fun.
-Come with me.

634
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,840
Very nice to see you.
-The pleasure is all mine. How are you?

635
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,840
I'm going to say hi to a few mates.

636
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,640
Everything okay?
Sorry.

637
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,400
Everything okay?

638
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,840
How about you?

639
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,640
And?
-And, does it grow?

640
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,160
He never knows when to quit.

641
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,880
I'm happy. You look hot.

642
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,680
Quit it.

643
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,360
I really enjoy it to see you

644
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,840
I'm completly wasted from the dancing.

645
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,320
I've also danced alot.
-Everything okay?

646
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,240
I'm happy.
I'm in a very special period.

647
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,360
I'll tell you about it.
I'm here with a guy.

648
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,280
Pierre?
- No.

649
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,080
I'm with Marcus.

650
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,800
I think he's completely insane.
-Yeah, it looks like it.

651
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,840
I want to have dinner with you
one evening.

652
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,080
Thank you.
-Then I'll tell you all.

653
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,920
She must tell me everything.

654
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,720
What does she have to tell?
-I don't know.

655
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,600
Are you alright?
-Yeah, of course.

656
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,680
Okay. Will you call me?
-Promised.

657
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,040
Well...

658
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,080
See you later.

659
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,160
Stop it.
- What?

660
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,160
What did you take?

661
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,200
Nothing. Nothing at all.

662
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,640
I'm sober as water.
My name is Jean-Francois.

663
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,040
Did you see your eyes?
-What's wrong with them?

664
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,680
You don't control your mouth.

665
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,640
You don't control your breasts.

666
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,440
Quit it, I want to rest.
-I've been looking for you for a while.

667
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,240
I was dancing.

668
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,200
Why do you have to swallow pills
to make fun?

669
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,560
I don't know. It's fun.
-You are no longer 15.

670
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,960
Sometimes you can be very sweet...

671
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,360
and soft, and at other moments
you can be a real moron.

672
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,840
Quit it, Alex.
-I want to go home.

673
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,760
I want to go home, I want some rest.

674
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,200
I'll bring you home.
-You look like a ghost.

675
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,240
Stop it, you are annoying me.
-Wait, I'll bring you home.

676
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,040
Don't touch me.

677
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,720
Come on!

678
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,160
I'll bring you home, I told you!

679
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,560
Alex, goddammit!

680
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,920
I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

681
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,480
I'm tired.
- But you're only here for an hour.

682
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,000
I want to go home.
-A minute ago, you were still dancing.

683
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,880
What's wrong?
-He's completely stoned.

684
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,480
I know.
-Take care of him.

685
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,320
He doesn't need me, you do.
-No I don't.

686
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:41,800
Don't worry.
I'll call you tomorrow.

687
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,800
No. I came for you.
To see you.

688
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,920
It has been months. I have to make
up something to see you.

689
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,040
To see you dance.
-Don't torture yourself like that.

690
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,080
I don't.
I can take it.

691
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,600
It's from esthetical pleasure.

692
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,200
From nostalgia to see you again.
Don't go away.

693
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,160
I'll call you tomorrow. Promised.

694
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,080
Why?
-You are a darling.

695
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,680
No, I'm not a darling. It's
uncareful to leave you alone.

696
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,240
I'm reading a very good book.
-How long?

697
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,720
Months.
-How many pages? 43?

698
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,520
It's really good.

699
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,800
After the index it's with each page...

700
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,360
What's it about?
-Well, it says...

701
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,280
The book?
-The book says...

702
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:37,640
It seems to be that the future is
completely decided already. Everything is fixed.

703
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,600
And the proof is the prophetic dreams.

704
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:45,400
Beautiful. That gets us asleep
at least.

705
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,520
Who knows what we are going to dream.
-You should write...

706
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,600
Sometimes I dream that I'm asleep.
My only dream.

707
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,560
Come on.
-Then you get relaxed.

708
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,360
Very suspenseful.
-Direction Louis Blanc.

709
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,560
Isn't that our stop?
-No, the next one.

710
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,640
You have to sleep.
Do you sleep 2 hours?

711
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,240
How many times did collapse,
after hours of work.

712
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,400
Was it good? Tell me.

713
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,560
You can't do it either, huh?
Terrible, huh?

714
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,200
What will make you come?

715
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,120
Stop it.
Why do you say something like that?

716
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,520
It's your own fault, if you go out
with your ex boy-friends

717
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,200
You can't make her come, huh?

718
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,400
We'll explain it to you one time.
-No, seriously.

719
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,240
What?
-Does he really make you come?

720
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,760
I don't say...
-You don't have to say anything.

721
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,960
Quit it. He with his monkey face.
Tell me.

722
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,000
Come on.

723
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,840
Don't be like that.
"Yes, we come."

724
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,960
You see how you are now, Pierre?
You want to explain everything.

725
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,800
Do you come or not?
I haven't been able to for years.

726
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,960
Don't excite yourself.
Everything is fine.

727
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,680
That's why you're in the back
and I'm up front.

728
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,040
No, seriously. There is nobody.
-Stop it.

729
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,080
Did he do something nice
or not?

730
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,360
You don't talk about that stuff.

731
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,520
Shall we do them then?
In turns.

732
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,600
That way we'll see if it works on them.
-It's complicated.

733
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,200
Did it work or not?
You held against me that...

734
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,840
I've been thinking for a long time...
I had results.

735
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,320
Excellent results, since...

736
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,280
Can he do it?
-We're not talking about sex.

737
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,880
Why not?
-You can talk about everything...

738
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,520
We can talk about sex,
just not with you.

739
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,440
He wants to explain everything.

740
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,600
Like sex. Sex is an act, you
don't talk about it.

741
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,720
But you can say how it is?

742
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,600
Did you enjoy a bit,
yes or no?

743
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,240
It's a vulgar question.
For me it was finished.

744
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:48,640
Why do you say that?
- I had to, from my cardiologist.

745
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,400
He said I would die from it.
"Her orgasm or your heart," she said.

746
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,760
Seriously.
- Stop it now.

747
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,800
there, a metro.
And it's blue with colors.

748
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,560
Did you achieve something or not?

749
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,960
Pierre!
- No, seriously.

750
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,760
We will explain everything.

751
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,040
Liar.

752
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,600
Liars have a big nose,
you have big ears.

753
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,400
Do I have a big nose?
- No, big ears. Your nose is nothing.

754
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,720
By the way, with the wind... look.

755
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,280
What an airflow.

756
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
a couple that cums.

757
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,960
One time...

758
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,920
One time she screamed.
- In four years, very good.

759
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,720
Because she bumped into
the pedestal.

760
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,040
Why are you acting like that?

761
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,160
The only tangible proof
of an orgasm.

762
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,840
And I believed in it.
I thought: Finally.

763
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,000
She cried. And it was bleeding.

764
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,880
You know what people say?

765
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,520
There are no women
who can't come,

766
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,040
only men who can't fuck.

767
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,400
And that's it.
-Why are you hurting yourself?

768
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,000
I am not. Tell me the truth and
I swill accept it.

769
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,840
I was too cerebral to
make her cum.

770
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,400
Then she follows a diet of banana's
and testosteron, and it's done.

771
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,480
You are trite.
- Seriously.

772
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,160
Do you do it for a banana diet?
Bravo.

773
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,840
Look at that couple going to a party
who don't share their bed secrets.

774
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,440
You have to be able to be tender.
- And you were so progressive.

775
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,200
I'll write it down, you never know
if I find the one.

776
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,080
It has been long that..
A knot, thank you.

777
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,560
No, I kept it for you.

778
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,480
How are those things called again?
Go on, tell me.

779
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,160
A tender gesture.
- No, for you it's hopeless.

780
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,160
You won't succeed anymore.
- Tell me.

781
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,560
You take care of your rats.
You can still do that.

782
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,160
I can't make them cum.
That's illegal.

783
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,160
I'm going crazy
or I'll rape children.

784
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,160
How do you do it?
- Don't make jokes about that.

785
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,840
Alex, what was the problem?
- What do you think?

786
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,520
His onomatopoeia?
His skin? His smell?

787
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,680
Or was it the tarzan yell?

788
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,640
Unimaginable.

789
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,720
You're saying I'm too intellectual.
Now I'm asking for something simple.

790
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,520
She gives a stroke,
she goes like...

791
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,960
Maybe you can sing at the same time.

792
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,360
What's that to me?

793
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,080
Am I annoying?
- No.

794
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,640
I am annoying. Sorry.
Sir, madam.

795
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,280
Excuse me.

796
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,720
Madam is coming.

797
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,400
Madam is coming,
but keeps it to herself.

798
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,720
How far are you with Sylvie?
- Like with the others.

799
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,360
After a few hours
of extreme effort...

800
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,720
Sylvie doesn't interest me.
- You know what your problem is?

801
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,040
You act like it's a big achievement.
-What?

802
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,320
To you it's a achievement.
-What?

803
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,360
Sex. You do it, but you¢¥re not
participating.

804
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,720
What do you tell me now?
-It's true.

805
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,640
The details of your private life
is none of my interests.

806
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,280
Excuse us, your honor.
-He started.

807
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:16,360
Later at the party you can continue
your discussion in the toilets.

808
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,960
Unbelievable.

809
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:23,200
What did you do more that I
couldn't do?

810
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,520
You are too old for that stuff.

811
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,120
I'm 2 years older than you are.
-A little bit more.

812
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,360
Mister starts cavilling.

813
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,240
You think too much about
the pleasure of the other.

814
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,640
You have to let yourself go lose.
-You are an altruist.

815
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,040
Get relaxed and think about yourself.
-That's selfish.

816
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,960
It's better like this.
Otherwise you get blocked.

817
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,800
You think too much about the
pleasure of others.

818
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,480
You get blocked because you
are not focusing on yourself.

819
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,400
In the end the pleasure of the woman,

820
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,800
is the pleasure of a man.

821
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,840
If I feel that the man isn't
enjoying...

822
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,360
his own pleasure...
-Wait a moment.

823
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,320
If I feel that the man doesn't go
up in his own pleasure...

824
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,160
You are not enjoying it because
I don't enjoy it?

825
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,760
No, I get blocked.
-What a bad thing to hear afterwards.

826
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,720
After all these years...
-I couldn't do it. No.

827
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,320
All this effort I took to
temper myself...

828
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,120
for hours.
I have been sweating from it.

829
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,960
Let me explain.
-And it was wrong? It had to be fast.

830
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,080
And you came two hours later,
while I was in the shower or asleep.

831
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,440
This is really fucked.

832
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,640
No, it's not like that.
-You push me too...

833
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,400
I wanted...
-He fucks and she comes hours later.

834
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,320
You can't explain.
-It's not rational.

835
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,560
Your problem is that you
want an explanation for everything.

836
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,560
But sometimes there is no explanation.

837
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,400
It's like that talking for centuries.
Sometimes you just have to fuck.

838
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,440
And afterwards everything is solved.
I don't know why.

839
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,480
The bodies talk.
-Don't I have to talk?

840
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,760
I talked during fucking.
Remember?

841
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,760
But the bodies.
-And everything I said got you excited.

842
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,040
It was just a chat.

843
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,280
But it interested you.

844
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,400
It was never a real extacy,
but once or twice...

845
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,480
Say it. He isn't listening anyway.
-More often.

846
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,800
Really? More often, mate! More often!

847
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,480
Mate!...more often.

848
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,040
You always talk like an intellectual.
-Me?

849
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,040
But after all it's always terra terra.
It's about sex.

850
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,480
That's good, isn't it?
-But you say he's an animal.

851
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,320
It's an essential need.

852
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,120
He doesn't possess the language.

853
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,200
"I fuck, I eat, I Marcus"

854
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,000
But I diverse.

855
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,480
I many trouble,
because I not speak the language very well.

856
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,760
The language.
-Come on now, "Language".

857
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,640
Are we there?
-I stay so I can wank myself off.

858
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,320
Well ok.

859
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,080
What a bullshit.

860
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,400
More often.
That's not bad at all.

861
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,840
Hello, Alexandra.

862
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,080
Pierre here. I've got car trouble.

863
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,360
I¢¥ll come and get you with the metro.

864
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,760
In 20 to 30 minutes.

865
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,600
I had a dream.

866
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,080
It was weird.

867
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,680
I don't have any feeling in my arm.

868
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,080
I walked through a tunnel.

869
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,280
A tunnel...

870
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,240
completely red...

871
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,640
And afterwards...

872
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,960
The tunnel broke in 2 pieces.

873
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,120
I think...

874
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,680
it's because of my menstruation.

875
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,440
Are you over time.
Remember?

876
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,520
A lot?

877
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,800
No, just a few days.

878
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,280
We'll see.

879
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,920
We had a long sleep.

880
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,800
We have to get up.
I have to buy a new bottle.

881
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,880
for the party tonight.
Pierre...

882
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,640
I have to be kind to him.

883
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,040
because in the end I stole
his wife.

884
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,160
What?

885
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,240
And I have to be too...
-No...

886
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,280
You didn't steal anything from anyone, honey.

887
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,600
I'm...
I'm not a thing.

888
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,280
You have not stolen anything
from anyone.

889
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,000
I have done it.
I have decided everything.

890
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,480
It's always the wife that decides.

891
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,680
Really.

892
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,000
But then again...

893
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:31,320
It's true that you decide.
By the way...

894
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,760
What do you get for me? Do you give
me parties with your ex?

895
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,560
He may be a friend.

896
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,440
But he is crazy about you.
He likes you.

897
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,000
Whatever, you will pay.
-I won't pay shit.

898
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,400
You decide and you pay for it.
-No, stop it.

899
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,480
No, wait. I'm not awake yet.

900
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,760
You'll pay for this.

901
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,480
If you hurt me, you'll pay.

902
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,560
You will pay.

903
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,960
The revenge of the elephant.
-Stop it!

904
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,600
Who kills children!

905
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,520
Stop it.

906
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,880
You know I don't like that.

907
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,360
Then I will revenge myself too.

908
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,600
With a kiss.

909
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,520
You crushed me.
-That's not true.

910
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,840
Wait, you...
-No.

911
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,320
Did I hurt you?
You're exaggerating.

912
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:49,040
You crushed my balls.
Dammit, Alex.

913
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,480
That can't be.
Did I hurt you?

914
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,760
You're a pig.

915
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
You're a dirty pig.

916
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:00,960
Then I will go away. I'll make
sone coffee. That will teach you.

917
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,000
Stop it.

918
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,800
Quit it.

919
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,920
I'll make some coffee.
-Make some coffee?

920
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,320
You know...
You should buy some booze.

921
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,480
Go on.

922
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,000
Okay.

923
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,880
Take a look,
I have something here that hurts.

924
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,720
No, really, I have something here.

925
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,040
Will you play some music?

926
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,840
No.

927
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,320
Alex...
- What?

928
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,960
I think I...
feel like fucking you in the ass.

929
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,680
No! I thought you were
going to say something romantic.

930
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,400
It is romantic.
- Oh? No, you know...

931
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,840
I love you.

932
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,920
I love you too.

933
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,040
And what if I were pregnant?

934
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,120
That wouldn't be so bad.

935
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,800
Yes, please.

936
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,960
Take a shower.

937
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,320
Hey, well...

938
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,200
I'm going to buy a bottle.

939
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,600
You have money?

940
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,920
Come on, stop it.
- What?

941
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,400
Do you ever have money?

942
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,560
Alright. Do you have some?

943
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,720
I'll get some from your purse.

944
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,000
See you later.

945
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,200
