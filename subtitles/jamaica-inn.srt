00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,180
(Wind howls)...

3
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,160
Can you make out the beacon light?
- Not yet.

4
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,590
About time we came up with it.
- Look to starboard.

5
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,080
Where?

6
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,040
I've lost it. It's gone. Did you see it?

7
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,140
No.

8
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,094
Nothing there.

9
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,220
(Crash)

10
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,260
Argh.

11
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,295
Argh.

12
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,160
Tell 'em to make sure
no-one gets clear of the wreck.

13
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
No-one, d'you hear?

14
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
(Man shouts orders)

15
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,097
That's all. Load up the horses.

16
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,760
Carry the rest yourselves.

17
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,640
Come on.

18
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,740
(Man barks orders)

19
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,400
Get the stuff up to the inn.

20
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,040
Come on.

21
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,700
Come along now.

22
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,920
You're sure no-one got away?

23
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,960
You can reckon on that, Joss.

24
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,000
Aye, you can reckon on that.

25
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Joss.

26
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,460
Help.

27
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,320
I told you to make certain, you fool.

28
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,360
Can't you use your eyes?

29
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,435
Do you want the lot of us to swing?

30
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,220
(Agonised scream)...

31
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,220
...(Whistling)

32
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,040
I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

33
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,200
That place gives me the creeps.
- Eh?

34
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,720
That place. Jamaica Inn.
It's got a bad name.

35
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,480
It's not healthy, that's why.
There's queer things goes on there.

36
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,785
Queer things. I won't stop there,
not if she were to offer me double fare.

37
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,240
Is Jamaica Inn on this road?

38
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
Yes.

39
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,120
How much further is Jamaica Inn?

40
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,370
Come on. Come on.

41
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
Come on. Gee up.

42
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,960
Why are we going so fast?
What's happened? Have the horses bolted?

43
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,920
BOTH: It's Jamaica Inn.

44
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,960
But this is where I want to get out.

45
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,800
Hi, coachman. Why don't you stop?
I want to get out.

46
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,560
Coachman, listen to me, you fool.
Pull up at once.

47
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,570
Why don't you stop, you fool?
Stop, I tell you.

48
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Whoa.

49
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,960
Why didn't you stop? Are you deaf?

50
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,040
I've been shouting myself silly.

51
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,720
You've taken me past Jamaica Inn.
Take me back at once.

52
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,760
You'd better try Squire Pengallan's instead.
They say he's partial to young women.

53
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,374
Here's your box. Gee up.

54
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,320
MAN: I think we owe a
toast to Sir Humphrey.

55
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Sir Humphrey.

56
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,460
Eh? What?

57
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Jove, yes.

58
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,080
Pengallan.

59
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,320
Thank you.

60
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,312
Might have asked you to drink the health of

61
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:33,440
His brand-new Majesty
George IV, but I forgot.

62
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,760
Fact is, I haven't been on speaking terms
for years with the fat fool.

63
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,640
You were much in his company at
one time, Sir Humphrey.

64
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,509
When Charlie Fox and Sheridan would...

65
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,760
...be there with him in
the Pavilion at Brighton.

66
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,920
In those days he was still a gentleman.

67
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,080
Now he's nothing but a painted bag
of maraschino and plum pudding.

68
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,600
WOMAN:
Last summer we made a tour of the lakes.

69
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,360
Which lake do you admire the most,
Sir Humphrey?

70
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,460
Chadwick.

71
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,000
Which lake did I admire the most?

72
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,040
Windermere, sir.
- Windermere.

73
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,960
It is very beautiful.
Why not a toast to beauty, Sir Humphrey?

74
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Why not?

75
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Chadwick, my figurine.

76
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,435
I need inspiration, by gad.

77
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,800
Oh, there's beauty.
- But it's not alive.

78
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,085
It's more alive than half the people here.
Look at them, what?

79
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,720
You want to see beauty alive? Chadwick.

80
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,760
Ask Sam how long Nancy's going to be.

81
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Nancy?

82
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,280
The most beautiful creature west of Exeter.

83
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,120
That's why he stays here
and never comes to London any more.

84
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,760
He keeps a girl here, the monster.

85
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,880
Then I prefer not to make her acquaintance.
- No. I'm curious.

86
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,720
Yes, by Jove.

87
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
Have her in, Pengallan.

88
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Here she is.

89
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,980
My exquisite Nancy.

90
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,340
(Horse whinnies)...

91
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,420
...(Murmurs of surprise)

92
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,760
Brought me in a hundred
guineas yesterday.

93
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,621
Ran away with the Bodmin Steeplechase,

94
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,720
didn't you, my dear?
Chadwick, what's that?

95
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,160
It's a woman, sir.

96
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,560
Don't argue with your women
when I'm entertaining.

97
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,282
WOMAN: The coachman left me stranded.

98
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,320
Ask your master to lend
me a horse and trap.

99
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,606
Let's have a look at her.

100
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:19,880
Ringwood, bet you 20-1
in guineas she's ugly.

101
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,980
I'll take you.

102
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,160
Would you er...

103
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,360
...oblige me by taking off
that coat for a moment?

104
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,920
Why should I?

105
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,760
I have a wager here.

106
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,600
Always respect a wager.

107
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Would you allow me?

108
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,160
But you're an exquisite shape, too.

109
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
My dear,

110
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
you're a beauty.

111
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Ringwood.

112
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,920
You've won.

113
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Here y'are.

114
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,320
RINGWOOD:
Look, here. I say, my bet, you know.

115
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,320
'She walks in beauty like the night.

116
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,640
Of cloudless climes and starry skies, hmm?

117
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,800
And all that's best of dark and bright

118
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Meet in her aspect...

119
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,940
...and her eyes.'

120
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,320
Thank you, sir, but I didn't come for poetry,
but for a horse.

121
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
A horse?

122
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,880
Being worthy of Lord Byron's poetry,
you shall have the horse.

123
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,870
My name is Sir Humphrey Pengallan.

124
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,680
I'm squire of Pengallan
and justice of the peace.

125
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,520
I'm Mary Yellan from Ireland.

126
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,680
And you're going where?
- To Jamaica Inn.

127
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,780
To Jamaica Inn?

128
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,560
You can't go there.

129
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,660
Why not?
- Sam.

130
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,440
This young lady wants to know
why she can't go to Jamaica Inn. Tell her.

131
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,600
Ooh, very rough there, miss.
No place for a young lady.

132
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,360
See, even Sam knows that.
No, you better stay here.

133
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,460
No, of course not.

134
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,720
I've come all the way from Ireland alone,
because I've nobody there now.

135
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,160
Your parents?

136
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,600
I'm going to Jamaica Inn,
because my Aunt Patience is there.

137
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
What a lovely horse.

138
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,780
Yes. Could you ride her?

139
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,320
Yes, of course.
I've been riding since I was a child.

140
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,280
Well, you shall ride her to the inn.

141
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,920
Thank you,

142
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,315
but I've got a box outside.

143
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,213
Oh, um... l'll take the box...

144
00:13:30,313 --> 00:13:32,720
...and conduct you myself
to er... your relative.

145
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,920
Sam, saddle the bay as well.

146
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,160
Chadwick.

147
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,120
Chadwick, this is Miss Mary Yellan
who's going to Jamaica Inn.

148
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,840
So she said, sir. I don't understand.

149
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,200
You've never understood anything,
so why be surprised at yourself now?

150
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,560
Try to understand this.
Miss Yellan is my friend.

151
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,823
If she returns here at any time, admit her at...

152
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,040
...once. See that she has
everything she requires.

153
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,720
Give me my greatcoat and muffler.
And a thick scarf for this lady.

154
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Pardon me.

155
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Chadwick,

156
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,120
I'll have some hot brandy
when I come back...

157
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,240
...and see that they put
a warming pan in the bed.

158
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,880
Very good, Sir Humphrey.

159
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,640
If you'll wait a moment,
miss, I'll get the scarf.

160
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,035
But I really don't need it.

161
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,320
If I can be of any service,
please command me.

162
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,755
Remember, I'm Pengallan,
and this is Pengallan land.

163
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,160
Don't forget, now.
- No, I won't.

164
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,200
Good night, Miss er... Yellan.

165
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,425
Good night, Sir Humphrey.

166
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
(Woman sobbing)...

167
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
...(Men laughing)...

168
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,380
...(Woman sobbing)

169
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Who's there?

170
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,560
What do you want?

171
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,000
Does Mrs Patience Merlyn live here?

172
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,640
She might.

173
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,280
And she might not.
Depending on your business.

174
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,280
I'm her niece from Ireland.
You must have heard.

175
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,840
I'm coming to live with my aunt and uncle.

176
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,320
What?

177
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,960
What put that in your head?
Who told you so, eh?

178
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,480
That's my business.
Go and tell your master I'm here.

179
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,120
Aren't you going to give me a kiss first?

180
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,709
You'll... You'll suffer
for this when my uncle's...

181
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:06,000
...told of it. I'll have you turned out of here.

182
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,760
You'll see.
- Oh, you wouldn't be hard on us, ma'am.

183
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,365
You see, your aunt would miss me.
- Get out of my way.

184
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
Correct.

185
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,940
Entirely correct.

186
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,920
I'm your aunt's loving husband,

187
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,898
your great big uncle Joss.

188
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,200
Come on.

189
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
WOMAN: Who's there?

190
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
There we are.

191
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,720
Aunt Patience.

192
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,334
Mary. Mary, my sister's Mary.

193
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,240
You know me, then, Aunt Patience?
- Yes, my dear, yes.

194
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,280
You're so like your mother.

195
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,920
When I heard your voice at first,
I thought it was hers.

196
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,440
And then when I saw you,
I thought for the moment...

197
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,940
She said you were expecting her to stay.

198
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,080
No, Joss, no.

199
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,440
But I wrote to you telling you everything.

200
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,540
Nothing came.

201
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
You wrote...

202
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,840
Mary,

203
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,940
you're in black.

204
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,480
Yes.

205
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,960
Mother died three weeks ago today.

206
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,440
(Mumbles) I'll have a drink.

207
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
How did it happen?

208
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
She hadn't been well,

209
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,120
but she said she must
leave her bed and work.

210
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,260
You know how Mother was.

211
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
(Whistling)

212
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,234
Patience. Don't stand
there yappering, woman.

213
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,800
Get the girl's box inside.

214
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,095
Yes. Yes, Joss.

215
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,810
No, no, Aunt Patience, let me.

216
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Easy, easy.

217
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,800
Your new uncle's very particular.

218
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,920
He's not the sort to let lovely ladies
spoil themselves with rough work.

219
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,080
He knows different, does Joss.
Lively with it, Patience, my dear.

220
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,520
I'll take this end.
- No. I can manage. It isn't heavy, Mary.

221
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,600
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- Mary, don't say anything.

222
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,520
I've had pretty women
pay me compliments before.

223
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,620
Stand clear there.

224
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,220
There.

225
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,240
Our Mary's a little bit sour tonight,

226
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,360
but, bless you, the best of us
can't be sweet-tempered on an empty belly.

227
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
Fill it up for her.

228
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,040
Yes, I'll get her something to eat.
Mary, if you'll come with me.

229
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,000
I won't be a minute.

230
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,040
If you'll sit down and rest.

231
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,160
I'll set the table.
- No, no, no, no.

232
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,480
You'll be tired after your long journey.

233
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,520
I'm not. Where's the
cloth and supper things?

234
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,340
Over there in the middle drawer.

235
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,020
(Raucous laughter)

236
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,854
It's nothing. Only some late customers...

237
00:18:54,954 --> 00:18:58,000
...in the parlour. They'll
be going soon, no doubt.

238
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
(Raucous laughter)

239
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Shut that gab.

240
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Keep it quiet.

241
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,800
You see, boys, we've got a visitor.
- Harry told us.

242
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,100
She's a neat piece from
what I've seen of her.

243
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Very neat.

244
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,120
That's all you think of, women.
Vanities of the flesh.

245
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,480
Following petticoats
along the path to everlasting corruption.

246
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,840
Salvation's off again.
- You can laugh now.

247
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,880
But you'll sing a different tune,

248
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,800
when you're roasting in the consuming fire
that's waiting for all of us.

249
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Me included.

250
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,880
Where are you going, Harry?
- To pay my respects.

251
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,960
She's not partial to your sort, Harry.

252
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,035
What about me in my new lace cuffs?

253
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,800
Anything in mind that way yourself?

254
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,920
Well, I hadn't given the matter a thought,
but I might.

255
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,020
I said I might, Harry.

256
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,660
All right, Joss.

257
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,560
Added to which,
she's my wife's niece from Ireland.

258
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,200
Why didn't you say that before?

259
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,040
My business, Harry, my business.

260
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,640
I knew a girl once.

261
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,680
Come from Ireland.
Talked funny, she did. Like a foreigner.

262
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,560
But it was all right.

263
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,200
I'm not what you expected, am I?

264
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,760
I was only a child when you went away,
Aunt Patience.

265
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,680
I can only just remember you then.

266
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,320
And what was I like then?

267
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
You were beautiful.

268
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,020
Was I?

269
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,760
Yes...

270
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
I suppose I was.

271
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,400
No doubt your mother
told you all about me.

272
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,800
You're thinking I'm paid
out for leaving home.

273
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,760
For running away. Well, you're wrong.

274
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,360
Joss has been a good husband to me.
There's nothing I'd change even if I could.

275
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,400
It's hard work and it's risky work.

276
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,720
It's work we'll rot in chains for one day.

277
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
All in a neat row.

278
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,200
And what do we get out
of it? Next to nothing.

279
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,608
Why, a man's share
doesn't come to enough...

280
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,320
...to hold body and soul together.

281
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,880
That last wreck didn't bring in
what it should have. That's what I say.

282
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,520
That's what you say.

283
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,000
No, that's what Sydney said.

284
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,880
So, you've been yapping, eh?
- No, no, Mr Merlyn, I assure you.

285
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,920
Showing off your arithmetic, eh?

286
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,280
Doing pretty sums for poor lads
that can't read nor reckon.

287
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,240
You're out to list the goods,
not set a price on them.

288
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Just a minute, Joss.

289
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,560
I told him the last haul didn't fetch
a quarter of what it should have done.

290
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,000
You did, eh?

291
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,040
Reckoning by our share of it,

292
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,200
maybe you're not getting
the right price for the stuff.

293
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,240
Maybe there's a leak somewhere.

294
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,340
(Harry whistles)

295
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,560
You're looking thoughtful, Harry.

296
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,800
Perhaps you'll give us
the benefit of your sentiments.

297
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
If any.

298
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,880
About this leak, I think the word is,

299
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,120
if you've a notion in your mind, Harry,
don't be bashful.

300
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,160
Spit it out. We'd be glad to listen.

301
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,200
I wouldn't know about that, Joss.

302
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,080
Well, perhaps I would.
Supposing there is a leak.

303
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,000
And supposing it happens before the goods
get to the inn, do you follow me?

304
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,960
Some absent-minded chap
might mislay a piece or two,

305
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,000
in a manner of speaking,

306
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,040
on the way up from the wreck.

307
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,120
Have you ever thought of that?
How long have you been with me?

308
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,240
A matter of five years, Joss.

309
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,280
Salvation?

310
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,075
We've been lost souls together
for two years and seven months, Joss.

311
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,240
Sydney?

312
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,520
Almost two and a half years, Mr Merlyn.

313
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,480
Dandy?

314
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,400
Let's see, now. I was carrying on
with a bit in Penzance around that time.

315
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,750
Here she is. Annie.
That makes it four years, Joss.

316
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
And you?

317
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
I'll tell them for you.

318
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,618
Mr Trehearne has been with us
the enormous time of two months.

319
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,480
Eight weeks.

320
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,580
56 days.

321
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,830
How's that for arithmetic?

322
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,240
What do you say to that, Mr Trehearne?

323
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,340
PATIENCE: Joss.

324
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
JOSS: Clear out.

325
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Joss, please.

326
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Why, what's wrong?

327
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,520
Joss, Mary's just told me,
she came to the inn with Squire Pengallan.

328
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,280
He asked her why she was coming here
and about us.

329
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,200
And, seeing he's a magistrate, I thought...

330
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,320
Joss, you don't think
he's found out anything?

331
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,360
What's this about Sir Humphrey, eh?
How did you come to meet him?

332
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,080
Why, I called on him.
The coach took me a long way past here.

333
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,120
So I went to the house for help.

334
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,680
Sir Humphrey was very
kind and most obliging.

335
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,840
He knows how to behave
towards a woman.

336
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,880
He even lent me a horse to ride here.

337
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,165
One that won him a hundred guineas
in the county steeplechase.

338
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,440
We didn't get the haul we
hoped for tonight, sir.

339
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:18,085
There was a full gale blowing down there
and the ship broke clean in two, sir.

340
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,560
Get a pair of scissors, Merlyn.

341
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
Yes, sir.

342
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,640
Why did you leave this blood on?

343
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,680
What do you think we're conducting?
A slaughterhouse? Cut it off.

344
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,200
There were so many tumbling in.
It was butcher's work.

345
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,047
What have they to live for, poor scum?

346
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,320
You were right to put
them out of their misery.

347
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,878
Look at this exquisite stuff.
Worth the miserable...

348
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,760
...lives of a hundred rum-rotten sailors.

349
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,880
Perfection of its own kind.
That's all that matters, Merlyn.

350
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,920
Whatever is perfect of its kind.

351
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,160
I'd transport all the riffraff in Bristol
to Botany Bay...

352
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,120
...to save one beautiful
woman a single headache.

353
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,280
Something you don't
understand. Never will.

354
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,000
Because you're neither
a philosopher nor a gentleman.

355
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,720
But you made certain, no survivors?
- Certain sure, sir.

356
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm sorry about that girl Mary, sir.
We didn't know she was coming.

357
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,160
She'll be no harm.
I'll get her away in the morning.

358
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,480
Make up the fire. It's cold.

359
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,790
Get me a drink.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,560
I didn't expect you so soon, sir,
before I'd put the light in the window.

361
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,680
A man's a fool to stir out on a night like this.

362
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,170
Taking a bit of a risk, wasn't it,

363
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,040
coming before I got
the men out of the way?

364
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,880
Everything's a risk.

365
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,600
This girl, Mary, not without character.
A mind of her own.

366
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,911
Oh, you leave her to me, sir.

367
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,960
I'll manage her, just as
I manage my Patience.

368
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,280
Have you looked at the stuff?
- I don't see any resemblance to your wife.

369
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,691
Maybe not, but my Patience was...

370
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,680
...a bit of a beauty when
I married her. Why, I...

371
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,760
This won't do, Merlyn. It's not enough.

372
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,680
No, sir, it's not quite what we looked for.
Better luck next time, eh, Sir Humphrey?

373
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,040
We could do with it.
The men are getting impatient.

374
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,680
I can deal with them, but they're asking
where the money goes. They want more.

375
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,040
What for? Rot their innards out sooner
with the blue ruin you sell 'em?

376
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,080
Listen, Merlyn. I want more.

377
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,431
I know what to do with
money when I have it.

378
00:25:55,531 --> 00:25:56,840
That's why I must have it.

379
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,080
Do you understand? I must have it.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,640
Anything more this week
while the weather still holds?

381
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,680
Perhaps tomorrow.
I've been thinking about your wife's niece.

382
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,040
It seems a pity to bundle her off
before she's seen anything of the county.

383
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,693
I've nothing against her stopping.

384
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:11,960
Provided, of course,
she's kept out of the way.

385
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,060
(Commotion downstairs)

386
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,760
Up to your rooms, both of you.

387
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,835
Patience, take her supper upstairs.

388
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,960
Now, try and sleep, dear. You must be tired.

389
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Good night.

390
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,337
Look at that.
- Ooh, how much?

391
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,240
You was right, Joss. See that?

392
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,315
Best part of fifteen pound in gold.

393
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
What did I tell you?

394
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,240
JOSS: You've got yourself
in a pretty mess, Mr Trehearne.

395
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,280
What have you got to say?

396
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,120
Get me a drink.

397
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,960
Choking gives you a thirst.

398
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,600
Thomas, I'm sure you'll
oblige the gentleman.

399
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,880
Seems I'm a good guesser, Mr Trehearne.

400
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,720
How did you get it?

401
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,360
Saved.

402
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,080
You mean, you've been
selling stuff on the side.

403
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,560
I'm ashamed of you, Mr Trehearne.

404
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
That's what I am.

405
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,748
Taking the bread out of
the mouths of your pals.

406
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:39,960
There's your leak.

407
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,600
Not true.

408
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,640
He's making fools of the lot of you.

409
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,680
Where do you think the stuff goes?

410
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,120
Who gets rid of it?
Do you think Joss is in this by himself?

411
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,110
Well, go on, ask him. Ask him who.

412
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,280
DANDY: That was a cosh. Clean out.

413
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,380
The dirty thief.

414
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,160
He asked for it all right.
- He done us. We do him.

415
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,640
What are we all waiting for?

416
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
(Harry whistles)

417
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,680
Try the other room.
See if you can find me a nice beam.

418
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,320
About six foot two off the floor.

419
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,800
Go on.

420
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
(Footsteps below)

421
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
JOSS:

422
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,360
Hold on. I'll see if the
women are out of the way.

423
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,010
Don't want a lot of squawking.

424
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
Hurry up.

425
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,880
It's a new chap, Trehearne.
They found this gold on him.

426
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,720
Know anything about him?

427
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,760
He came from St lves a
couple of months ago,

428
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,760
recommended by a pal.

429
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,120
Can't just kick him out. That's obvious.
- He might talk.

430
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,280
The men want to string him up tonight.
- Really? That's a trifle formal, isn't it?

431
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,320
Pistol. Oh, no. Too noisy.

432
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,095
Of course, you wouldn't want
to alarm your wife's niece.

433
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,760
I suppose it's as good a way as any.

434
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,800
No need for you to go. Tell 'em.

435
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,790
I haven't finished talking to you.

436
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,160
Harry?
- Yes?

437
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,800
Get on with it.

438
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,045
I'll be down in a minute.
- All right.

439
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,495
Come on, Salvation. Look sharp.

440
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,240
Stand back, the rest of you.

441
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,120
We don't want any gawpers here.

442
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,562
This is private, see. If
you want a public hanging,

443
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:41,160
Syd, you won't have to wait long.

444
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,200
And you'll get a fine view of it
from the best position. Inside the rope.

445
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
(Laughter)

446
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,150
You're not old enough yet.

447
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,840
SALVATION: What about Joss?

448
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,680
HARRY: He says to get it over.

449
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,520
DANDY: Is this the place, Harry?

450
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,040
HARRY: That's it. Plenty of clearance.

451
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,680
Anything worth doing, I say,
is worth doing proper.

452
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,780
(Harry whistles)

453
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,320
Come on.

454
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,040
Let's make a quick job of it
before he comes round.

455
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,880
I won't be a party to that, Thomas.

456
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,840
It's only being kind to him.
He won't know nothing about it.

457
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,800
It's no kindness to send a man
into the next world unawares.

458
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,760
It's heathen. That's what it is, I say.

459
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,400
Bring him round with a nip of spirits
and give him a fair chance to meditate.

460
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,640
I don't like the thought of it somehow.
It's like doing it in cold blood.

461
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,280
Come on. He's heavy.

462
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,960
What do you say, Harry?
- I say shut your misbegotten mouths.

463
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,060
Both of you.

464
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,160
Aha.

465
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,720
At it again, Dandy?
Grab, grab, grab all the time.

466
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,495
We'll spin a coin for them buckles,
when I say the word.

467
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,780
Let's have a light.

468
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,740
(Harry whistles)

469
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
HARRY: All together.

470
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Pull.

471
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,920
Don't you let him have them, Harry.
- Go on.

472
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,680
Throttle him, Dandy.
- Go on, Harry.

473
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,370
HARRY: Shut your mouth.
Do you want to bring Joss down?

474
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,440
You've got to get out of here.

475
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,920
They'll be back in a minute.

476
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,360
Please, you must try.

477
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Quick, quick.

478
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,720
You mustn't stop here. Get away.
- I couldn't leave Aunt Patience.

479
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
Please, you must hurry.

480
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
(Horse gallops away)

481
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Quick. Before Joss...

482
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,840
There you are, my dear.

483
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,915
Been saying good night to Patience?

484
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,520
Yes, I've been thinking things over.

485
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,920
'She's a sweet, pretty girl,' I said to myself,
'with a lot of character.'

486
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,504
It seems a pity to send her away,

487
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:45,240
before she's hardly seen
anything of the county.

488
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,320
'She can stay here,' I said,
'just as long as she feels inclined.'

489
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,420
HARRY: Joss. Joss.

490
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,530
Come down, Joss.

491
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,150
(Shouting from downstairs)

492
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
He's been took, Joss.

493
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,120
What? Who?
- Trehearne, he's been took by the angels.

494
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,440
Of course, he's been took. I know that.
- But alive, Joss. Alive.

495
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,080
Mary.

496
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
It was you.

497
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,220
You set that man free.

498
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,580
Listen to me. You must
leave Jamaica Inn now,

499
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,880
this minute, do you hear?

500
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
There y'are.

501
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,785
That blasted girl, I'll kill her.

502
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,060
For pity's sake, go now.

503
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,060
Before Joss comes up.

504
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,820
Where's that girl?

505
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Where is she?

506
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
You let her go.

507
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,220
JOSS:

508
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,680
Thomas, take this lamp.
Look in the stables.

509
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,200
Harry, give me a hand.
We'll go through the yard.

510
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,520
If some of you don't get a move on,
I'll break your blasted necks.

511
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,360
SALVATION: They can't
have got away so soon.

512
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,120
We can't stay here. Come on.
- Where?

513
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,160
Down by the harbour. I know a place.

514
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,980
We'll be safe there for a while.

515
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
Come on. Hurry.

516
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,160
SYDNEY: Joss. Shall I search the moor?

517
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,296
HARRY: Try the yard.

518
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,415
We'll have to get 'em,
if we stay out all night.

519
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,360
There's not a sign of either of them.

520
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,400
They've got clear. Any luck?
- No.

521
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,840
If we don't find 'em,
we'll swing for it, like as not.

522
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,880
Harry, take a couple of
men down to the coast.

523
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,446
Thomas, get your brother
and any of our chaps...

524
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:56,120
...you can find. Search the moors.

525
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,575
What are you going to do, Joss?
- I'll take the Bodmin turnpike.

526
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,660
SIR HUMPHREY: Chadwick.

527
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,760
It's very late, sir.
- She was a very charming girl, Chadwick.

528
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,054
I didn't mention it before,
sir, but the butcher...

529
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:11,600
...was here while you were at dinner.

530
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,480
He wants his account settled.
- Remarkably unattractive occupation.

531
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,200
Drearily dismembering
carcass after carcass.

532
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,520
I suppose they must live, sir.
- Must they?

533
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,640
There's nearly £40 owing to the butcher,
£35 to the baker.

534
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,480
You see, sir, butcher, baker...

535
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,480
Don't butcher and baker me.

536
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,580
You old numbskull.

537
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,840
I'm sorry, huh, Chadwick, what?

538
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Doing your duty.

539
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,360
That's all, Master Humphrey.

540
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,760
These outbursts of mine
are quite inexcusable.

541
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,665
I can't think what comes over me.

542
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
By the way, Chadwick,

543
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,898
what happened to my grandfather?

544
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,105
Yes, went mad, didn't he?

545
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,454
(Knock on window)

546
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,360
No need for you to hang about, Chadwick.

547
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Go to bed.

548
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,400
How dare you come here to me.
Haven't I told you a score of times?

549
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,160
Yes, but Trehearne has got away.
That girl set him free.

550
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,520
I couldn't help it. It
was while I was with you.

551
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,240
What have you done with her?
- She's gone, too.

552
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,280
Oh, a general exodus, apparently.

553
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,440
You persuaded your wife to remain, I hope.

554
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,120
The men are out looking for them now.
We're doing our best.

555
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,600
Is that all you came here to say?

556
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,345
That chap Trehearne knows too much.

557
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:08,720
If he was to inform against
me and the others...

558
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,760
You're losing your head, Merlyn.

559
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,680
Even if Trehearne lives to do any informing,
he'll do it here.

560
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,720
I'm the only justice in the neighbourhood.

561
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,800
If you can't keep your wits about you,
kindly allow me to keep mine.

562
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,200
If I didn't, you'd never see another wreck.

563
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,920
When the brains are out,
the body dies, Merlyn.

564
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,280
And I needn't remind you
that in this little organisation,

565
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,640
you and your fellows are only the carcass.

566
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,960
The brains are here, what?
- I'm sorry. I was only trying to warn you.

567
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,600
Will you let me do the warning?

568
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,420
If you want any more fat
pickings on the shore,

569
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
just obey orders.

570
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,360
And don't come here
again. Get out. Get out.

571
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,620
(Seagulls cry)

572
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Hey. What?

573
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,665
Come back. What on earth?

574
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,520
Now, what do you think you're doing?
- Let go.

575
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,280
Don't be a fool. You can't even row.

576
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,800
Leave me alone.

577
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,940
You're not afraid of me?

578
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,520
You are. Well, that's women for you.
Save your life one minute...

579
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,105
...and frightened for their own the next.

580
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,620
Yes, I'm not a very pretty
sight at the moment,

581
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
but I don't bite.

582
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,038
You think I don't know why
my aunt is frightened...

583
00:40:16,138 --> 00:40:18,000
...for her life, that I don't know what you...

584
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,780
...and the rest of you
are doing at Jamaica Inn?

585
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
No. What?

586
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,120
Thieves, smugglers,
cut-throats, for all I know,

587
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,220
and I'm not staying.

588
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,840
Look.

589
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,360
Harry, here.

590
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,400
A very significant piece of flotsam, eh?

591
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,965
BOY: It came out of the cave.

592
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,120
Suppose you ask your brother
to take you for a nice row? Follow me?

593
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,640
Rather.
- Can I go, too, Harry? I saw it first.

594
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,720
No, you cut back
and tell Joss everything's lovely. Run.

595
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,540
Dandy, you go and get some rope.

596
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,820
This way.

597
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
(Harry whistles)

598
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,793
You know what you've
done? The tide's going...

599
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:22,440
...out now, but it'll be high
water again before dark.

600
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,560
We can't stay here without that boat.

601
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,720
We'll have to run for it
as soon as the tide's low enough.

602
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,960
Trust me to land myself with a woman.

603
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,028
On the other hand, you did save my life.

604
00:41:32,128 --> 00:41:34,600
I hope you'll make better
use of it in the future.

605
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,580
A tall order for a
desperate character like me.

606
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
No doubt.

607
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,024
A smuggler and a cut-throat,
I think you said.

608
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,920
Do you think there's any hope for me?

609
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,600
Tell me, what ought I to do?
- Anything you please.

610
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,720
I used to be a sailor. I could go back to sea.

611
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,120
I'm not in the least interested.
- You must be.

612
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,160
You're responsible for me.
- I am not.

613
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,600
But for you, I shouldn't be here at all.
You can't deny that.

614
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,480
When we're safe in Truro,
I shall put myself in your hands.

615
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,720
Oh, please be quiet.
- Oh, cheer up. We'll be there by...

616
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,820
...(Whistling)

617
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,880
SALVATION: Take the little book.

618
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,760
There's a beautiful hymn on page 1 3.

619
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,640
'While at death's door I trembling stand.'

620
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,935
Very comforting.

621
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,000
Makes dying a pleasure, so he says.
- A handsome couple.

622
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,320
Breaks my heart to disturb 'em.

623
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,160
Coming down.

624
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,280
HARRY: Will you send the lady up first
or do you fancy it yourself?

625
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,600
DANDY: Ladies first, I always say.

626
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,640
What can we do?
- They know we're stuck.

627
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,680
They must have seen the boat drift out.

628
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,680
HARRY: Just in case you'd like a bit of help,
Mr Trehearne,

629
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,370
your old friend Thomas
is coming down to offer his arm.

630
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,680
He's out.

631
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,720
Any more? We're fond of company.

632
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,440
You'll get it all right. Never you fear.

633
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,520
It'll be a pleasure. Come on. Who's it to be?

634
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,200
Here, Belcher. Grab this.
Slip it round that bit of rock. Quick.

635
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,000
Do you hear that?
There's only one way out of this.

636
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,680
Can you swim?

637
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,463
Just to please you, Mr
Trehearne, so you won't...

638
00:43:06,563 --> 00:43:08,800
...feel lonely, we're all three coming down.

639
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,547
Please don't trouble with
me. I'll be in the way.

640
00:43:11,647 --> 00:43:14,240
It'll be hard enough for
you getting away alone.

641
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,680
I'll be all right. Joss daren't harm me.

642
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,320
Can you swim?
- A little.

643
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,800
Take off that dress and your shoes.
- I can't do that.

644
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,440
Take it off.
- I can't.

645
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,620
All right, then. I will.
- No, you won't. I will.

646
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,860
(Harry whistles)...

647
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,472
...(Yawns) I shall be glad
when this little job's over.

648
00:43:34,572 --> 00:43:35,840
We've been up all night.

649
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,640
Yes, it'll be nice to get to bed.

650
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,120
DANDY: What about the girl?
Do we hand her over to Joss?

651
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,260
They're coming. Come on.

652
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,315
HARRY: Now, Mr Trehearne...

653
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,520
That's the spirit. You're doing fine.

654
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,620
That's funny.

655
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,400
First time I've ever
seen a woman swimming.

656
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
All this... this salt.

657
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,920
Look. They've sent a boat.
It's coming this way.

658
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,120
Quick. Those rocks.
Hold onto my shoulder. Are you all right?

659
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,600
Hold on. The boat's coming.
- I can't.

660
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,910
(Jem whispers) Here it is.

661
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,600
Keep it up. They're going.
- It's no good.

662
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,910
I'm going.
- Hang on to me.

663
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,260
SIR HUMPHREY: Dowland.

664
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,320
Ah, good morning, Dowland.

665
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,360
I haven't had a taste
of that sloe gin of yours this year.

666
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,600
I'm three pounds short, Squire Pengallan.
- I told you...

667
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,360
Dowland, I want money just as you do.
I can't be Squire Pengallan on nothing.

668
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,400
Why are you short?
- That lad of mine.

669
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,865
He went down with a bad
leg and it won't heal.

670
00:45:05,965 --> 00:45:07,280
Take him to Dr Mackintosh.

671
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,680
Give the doctor my compliments.
Ask him to look at the leg. Pay £3 next time.

672
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,120
Thank you, Squire.
- Give him a receipt, Davis.

673
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,360
But I warned...
- The receipt, Davis.

674
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,520
This man's forefathers
were farming Pengallan land...

675
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,240
...when yours were hedge tinkers. Next.

676
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,520
Where can we go? Which way?
- We'd best make for the turnpike.

677
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,560
Wait. What house is that over there?

678
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,800
The Squire's.
- You mean Sir Humphrey?

679
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:33,400
I know him. I was there last night.
He'll be glad to help us. Come on.

680
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,275
This is the fellow I
mentioned, Sir Humphrey.

681
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,415
Burdkin. A rank radical.

682
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,020
DAVIS: Burdkin.

683
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,620
Er, well, Burdkin?

684
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,500
I've come to complain. I want my rights.

685
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,040
Your rights? I don't listen
to that sort of talk.

686
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,800
I've the law on my side.
- You haven't.

687
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,520
I'm the law here and on your side I won't be
while you take that tone.

688
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,880
Next you'll be telling me
you're as good as I am.

689
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,440
I'm a man, same as you.

690
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,400
Put that out of your head
before it lands you in the hulks.

691
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,612
You're not as good as
I am and never will be.

692
00:46:11,712 --> 00:46:13,440
Nature was against it from the start.

693
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,560
Everything else has been against it since.
I'm a gentleman.

694
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,920
Why, you great...

695
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,090
Have him run out, Davis.

696
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,160
Er, don't give him 24 hours.

697
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,700
If you please, Squire Pengallan.

698
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,600
Why if it isn't Granny Tremarney.

699
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,120
Yes, Your Honour.

700
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,089
It's my roof. I've complained
to Mr Davis about it,

701
00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:43,000
but he takes no notice. It
leaks all the time now.

702
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,160
Give her a new roof, Davis.
- But, Sir Humphrey...

703
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,260
I said a new roof.

704
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,960
She's my oldest tenant, hm?
While I'm here, she'll be snug.

705
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,200
I'm the only man under the rank of marquis...

706
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,440
...who ever gambled ten
years at White's Club...

707
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,520
...and kept his estate
out of the hands of the moneylenders.

708
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,560
While I have a roof, she shall have one.

709
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,280
MARY: I must see Sir Humphrey...
- What's this?

710
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,520
MARY: you're to let me
in. It's very important.

711
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,880
My dear child, what on earth's happened?

712
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,480
You're... soaked to the skin.

713
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,520
Chadwick, get Mrs Black
and close the door.

714
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,620
Come to the fire.

715
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,120
Tell them to go now,
Davis. Some other time.

716
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,760
But you're positively blue with cold.

717
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,600
Where have you been?
- Swimming.

718
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,200
For our lives.
- Er... Who, er... Who is this?

719
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,760
This is Jem Trehearne.
We got away from Jamaica Inn last night.

720
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,410
It's a horrible place. It's nothing better than...

721
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,800
...a den of smugglers.
They'd have murdered him.

722
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,520
She saved my life, sir.
- Well, this is extraordinary.

723
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,800
We need your help. My aunt's still there.
If you only knew...

724
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,483
You must tell me the whole story,

725
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,760
but, first, we must find
you some dry things.

726
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,963
Oh, Mrs Black, take this
young lady upstairs...

727
00:47:49,063 --> 00:47:51,120
...and see if you can find
her something to wear.

728
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,160
Will you come this way, miss?

729
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,850
Could I speak to you for a moment, please?
- Of course.

730
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,220
SIR HUMPHREY: Really?

731
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,889
(lndistinct voices)

732
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,000
Well, er... We, er...
We must see what we can do, hm?

733
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,585
Thank you. You're very kind.
- Not at all.

734
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,140
(Door closes)

735
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,240
Oh, er, excuse me, sir.

736
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,760
Chadwick.

737
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,640
Get the erm... fellow some
er... bread and beer.

738
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,865
I'll deal with you later.

739
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,920
MAN: So, I let her have it with nine
eight-pounders, then we went alongside...

740
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,400
'Wherein I spake of most
disastrous chances,

741
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,000
of moving accidents by flood and field
of hairbreadth 'scapes...'

742
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,560
Captain Murray, you'll stay to dinner?
- You keep the best table in Cornwall.

743
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,600
I should hope so. Why go?
- I'm due to rejoin my ship at Falmouth.

744
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,406
By the time you've finished your port...

745
00:48:55,506 --> 00:48:57,520
...and walnuts, I shall be
sailing past the house.

746
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,255
The deuce you will.
(Door opens)

747
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,800
I must have a word with you.

748
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,740
Well?
- Er, in private.

749
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,400
There's nothing you can tell me
these gentlemen shouldn't know.

750
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,840
One of a gang of smugglers
from Jamaica Inn.

751
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,840
Smugglers, eh?
Have you got any good brandies through?

752
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,880
Well, yes, as a matter of fact,

753
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,436
I've got a list of them here.

754
00:49:18,536 --> 00:49:20,720
Kindly remember I'm a justice of the peace.

755
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,000
Nevertheless, I think you'll
be rather interested...

756
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:27,101
...in these brandies.

757
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,220
Erm...

758
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,100
Er, gentlemen,

759
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,760
I think I must look into
this matter in private.

760
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,600
What?
- (Chuckles)

761
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,825
Come along, my dear chap.

762
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,760
Pengallan, if you don't find something good
for me, I'll report you to the Commission.

763
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,070
After you, my dear fellow.

764
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,060
I've placed some bread and
beer for this person...

765
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,160
...in the harness room.

766
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:11,480
Have you now? Place some cold chicken
and claret 'for this person' in the study.

767
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,520
Find some clothes for Mr Trehearne.

768
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:17,640
Mine would be a trifle generous. One of
Lord George's would be nearer the mark.

769
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,400
For this gentleman?
- Yes. Will you hurry? Hurry.

770
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,520
Master Humphrey...
- I must apologise.

771
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,843
I hadn't the least idea who
you were. Now, a stiff...

772
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:27,080
...glass of brandy till you're
fed and in dry clothes.

773
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,840
I'm most awfully obliged to you.

774
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,480
Not at all. Come in.

775
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,800
I hold the rank of Lieutenant
in His Majesty's Royal Navy.

776
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,320
I was seconded for duty
from the Home Office.

777
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,960
I've been at some pains
to conceal my identity.

778
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,594
I still haven't the least
notion what it's all about,

779
00:50:41,695 --> 00:50:43,400
but swallow this before you tell me.

780
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,130
I always had a great
admiration for the service.

781
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,520
I knew Collingwood well.

782
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,840
All fine fellows. A trifle desiccated, perhaps.
One can't have everything.

783
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,880
Now, what is all this business?

784
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,980
Smuggling?

785
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,240
No, it's much worse than
that, sir. Wrecking.

786
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,760
Deliberate, organised wrecking.

787
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,600
Not here, though?
- Yes, sir. Along this coast.

788
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,920
Always had wrecks here, you know.
A very dangerous coast.

789
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,040
Lloyds discovered that these wrecks
had one curious feature in common.

790
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,800
Indeed? Drink that up.

791
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,040
I think I'll join you with the brandy.

792
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,800
It has been er... quite an eventful morning.

793
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,440
What had these wrecks in common?

794
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,175
There were never any survivors.

795
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,400
Er, Mr Trehearne,

796
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,320
if what you tell me is true,

797
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,880
it's the most dreadful thing I've ever heard.

798
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:43,720
We hear of wrecks down here...
- Lloyds consulted with the Home Office.

799
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,760
They became convinced these wreckers
had accurate information...

800
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:51,600
...of the movements and cargoes of ships...
(Knock at door)

801
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,440
Captain Murray
wishes to say goodbye to you, sir.

802
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,260
Would you excuse me?
- Certainly.

803
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,080
I'm just going. I enjoyed myself immensely.
You're a prince.

804
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,320
Goodbye, Captain. Bon voyage.
- I'm coming back again.

805
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,643
I shall be thinking of you
out there in this wind...

806
00:52:10,743 --> 00:52:14,228
...when I'm sitting over my port tonight.

807
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,820
All right?
- Jolly good.

808
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,520
Well, er, Mr Trehearne,

809
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,160
kindly continue.

810
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,680
My researches took me to Jamaica Inn.
The landlord is the ringleader.

811
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,080
That wreck last night was
carried out by his men.

812
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,960
You were actually there?
- No, thank heaven, I was still on probation.

813
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,715
But I helped carry the goods up afterwards.

814
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,940
Have you erm...

815
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,000
Have you reported all
this to your superiors?

816
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,100
No, not yet.

817
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,730
I'm after bigger fry than Joss Merlyn.

818
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:59,760
I don't follow you. Erm...
You er... said he was the ringleader.

819
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,280
At Jamaica Inn, yes,
but he gets his orders from outside.

820
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,520
His information comes from outside.

821
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,400
His thinking's done for him outside.

822
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,160
By whom?
- I don't know.

823
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,241
Merlyn's own wife doesn't
know. The gang don't...

824
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:17,336
...even know. That's the
man we've got to find.

825
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,660
(Wind howls)

826
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:30,200
Yes, Joss has called the men for tonight.
There's to be another wreck.

827
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,680
They won't know where
until they get information from their leader.

828
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:38,280
In order to give them that information,
he'll be going to the inn tonight.

829
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,320
We must get there first.
- We can't do that single-handed.

830
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,520
I'll ride for help to the nearest garrison.

831
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,123
But that'll take time. We
mustn't let this fellow...

832
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,400
...slip through our fingers.

833
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,740
You and I will go to the
inn. My groom can take...

834
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,760
...a message to the
garrison at Truro for you.

835
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,860
Take some of those.

836
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,560
You say Merlyn's riffraff
won't be there till later?

837
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,360
I fancy we two can hold the fort
till the military come.

838
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,920
I'm game, if you are, sir.
- Excellent. This is positively exciting.

839
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,560
(Knock at door)
- Come in.

840
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,040
Chadwick, your money or your life?
- The clothes, sir. I've not told Lord George.

841
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,080
Who's the commander at Truro?

842
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,180
Er...

843
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,320
Captain... Boyle, an Irishman, I believe.
Good fellow in a pinch.

844
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,560
I'll write him a note.

845
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:22,165
No, I'll do that.
You get into Lord George's breeches.

846
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,820
To, er...

847
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,374
Captain... Boyle... erm...

848
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,775
...officer commanding...

849
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,970
...county militia,

850
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,140
Truro.

851
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,000
What shall I erm... say to him?

852
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,240
You know this style of thing.

853
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,805
Your help is needed urgently.

854
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,220
Your er... help?

855
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,260
Help, yes. Help.

856
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,814
Is... needed... urgently.

857
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,680
(Jem continues dictating)...which...

858
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:17,005
SIR HUMPHREY: For which...?
For which, er...? For which, er...

859
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,740
JEM: to give your immediate attention...

860
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,120
JEM: I have with me an officer of the law,
James Trehearne...

861
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:32,385
SIR HUMPHREY: Officer of the law,
James Trehearne.

862
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,560
JEM: Got that? All right, Sir Humphrey?
SIR HUMPHREY: Yes.

863
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:46,120
He reports that the wreckers have their
headquarters at Jamaica Inn, Pengallan.

864
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,609
And has enough evidence...

865
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,520
...to hang the landlord and his accomplices.

866
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,360
Are you ready?
- Yes.

867
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,600
A miraculous fit.
You put Lord George in the shade, what?

868
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,360
I'd better get you a hat.

869
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,720
Chadwick.

870
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,520
We must leave at once, you know.
- One moment, sir.

871
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,440
The girl, Miss Yellan,
she mustn't know about this.

872
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,366
Oh, no, no, no. That must wait.

873
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:17,200
Poor thing. Evidently
devoted to her relative.

874
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,520
I had no choice, Sir Humphrey.
I couldn't tell her the truth.

875
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,760
Tell Sam I want him at once. Where is he?

876
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,520
In the kitchen, sir.
- Sam.

877
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,560
You'd better have a warm cloak.

878
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:30,120
Get Mr Trehearne the blue cloak,
not the one with the astrakhan collar,

879
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,760
get him a hat, and get me my cloak and hat.

880
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,160
Oh, Sam.
- Ride into Truro as fast as you can.

881
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,120
Deliver that to Captain Boyle
at Militia Headquarters.

882
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,880
SIR HUMPHREY: Gallop all the way.
SAM: Very good, sir.

883
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,200
Would you be good enough to tell Robbins
I want my coach at once? Come along.

884
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,300
Chadwick.

885
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,280
Your coat, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

886
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,120
Would you tell Mrs Black
to look after the young lady...

887
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,800
...and if she can persuade her
to get a little sleep, so much the better?

888
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,040
Will you make my excuses for me?

889
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,520
Tell Lord George I'll be back for dinner.

890
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:04,425
Yes, sir.
- Oh, thank you so much.

891
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,540
Robbins.

892
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,880
Where is my coach?

893
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,520
Isn't it ready?

894
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,280
The young lady came round the back
and took it, sir.

895
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,920
BOTH: What?
- She said you had ordered it for her, sir.

896
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:26,335
Do you think?
- Horses. Quick, will you?

897
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,347
You must come away with
me while there's time.

898
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,360
That man I cut down was a law officer.

899
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,699
He's on his way here
now with Sir Humphrey.

900
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,400
They've sent to Truro for help.

901
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,560
I must change.
Get your things together before they come.

902
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,080
I must tell Joss.

903
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,000
No time.
- I'll not leave without Joss.

904
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,640
They know the truth and,
Aunt Patience, so do I.

905
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,120
This is your last chance to be free of him.

906
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,360
No.

907
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,200
He's a wrecker, a murderer.

908
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,160
But he's my husband. Oh, Mary,
you don't understand. You don't know him.

909
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,260
(Footsteps)

910
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:12,445
She's come here to warn
us. We must get away.

911
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,200
Where's that fellow? Where's Trehearne?

912
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,880
Joss, they're coming for you.
Trehearne's a law officer. We can't...

913
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,980
...(Knock at door)...

914
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,420
...(Knocking continues)

915
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,560
Keep quiet.

916
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:02,440
I don't think I need tell you
why I'm here with this officer, Merlyn.

917
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,280
I fancy you'll be able to guess.
I demand the right to search your premises.

918
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,695
Perhaps you'd show us round, Mr Merlyn?

919
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,640
All clear in there, Sir Humphrey.

920
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,280
So, you're here.
How quick of you, Mr Trehearne,

921
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,240
but law officers waste very little time.

922
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,560
I'm sorry. Come here, Mrs Merlyn.

923
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,920
She had nothing to do with this.
- I hope not.

924
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,280
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

925
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,240
So you could have warned your aunt?

926
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,768
And why not? She's
innocent. She won't run...

927
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,240
...away. Nothing will
drive her away from Joss.

928
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,680
If that is the case, perhaps Mrs Merlyn
will mix us something to drive out the cold.

929
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,600
What would you like?
A hot brandy, if you'd be so kind.

930
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,695
JEM: Up the stairs, Joss. Go on. Get up.
- Joss?

931
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,040
I'm sorry about this, believe me.

932
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:50,540
But try not to worry. We'll do our best.

933
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,520
Aunt Patience,
you've known about Joss all along.

934
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,320
I love him. People can't help
being what they are. Joss can't. I can't.

935
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,560
There's nothing to be done.
- Even now you could leave him.

936
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,560
Go and put the kettle on the fire
while I get the brandy.

937
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,960
This is where he comes
in, up these stone steps.

938
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,080
You're expecting a visitor, aren't you?

939
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:13,640
He comes to one of these rooms.
I've tried that door, but it's locked.

940
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,280
Give me the key.

941
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:20,650
I'll break that door down.
- Don't be a fool. Give him the key.

942
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,220
Go on. Get in.

943
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,920
Mind your head, Sir Humphrey.

944
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,760
These doors are rather low.

945
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,400
Oh, er, thank you.

946
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,560
This looks more like it.
- Never used.

947
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,840
What did you say, Merlyn?
- I say it's never used.

948
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,560
No? Then why is that fire alight?
- You're right.

949
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,760
Our friend's apparently expected very soon.

950
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:48,280
Deuced considerate of the fellow.
I like a good fire.

951
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
Here's something.

952
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,920
What do you make of it?
- It's blood on silk.

953
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,600
We got silk from last night's wreck.
You see? He was here last night.

954
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:05,905
JEM: Foolish of you to overlook this, Joss.
- One might even say careless.

955
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:09,680
See that, Sir Humphrey?
There's been many others, too.

956
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,720
An unusual place. Behind the curtain.

957
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,360
A signal?
- You've hit it.

958
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:17,880
Open the door at the end of the passage.
- Certainly.

959
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:22,230
Thank you.
- Oh. Thank you.

960
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:40,200
Joss, who is it who comes here?
- Would you like to know?

961
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,440
I'll tell you. Santa Claus. Every Christmas.

962
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,040
Things'll be a lot easier, if you tell me.
You don't plan these wrecks.

963
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,795
Who does?
- You'll find out, Mr Law Officer.

964
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,720
The wall's covered in plaster.

965
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,760
I left the door open for him.
- Good.

966
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,440
What about the signal?
Better light it up for him.

967
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,540
I'll do that.

968
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,480
What about the women?
Better bring them up.

969
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,580
Right. I'll get them.

970
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,280
Watch him.
- Fetch my toddy while you're about it.

971
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:18,520
Right.

972
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,000
SIR HUMPHREY: Still blowing?

973
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,680
Hard as ever, sir.
- Take your orders, Merlyn.

974
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,780
Another wreck? Tonight?

975
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,480
Captain Murray
would like to have dined with me.

976
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,000
He dislikes the food on
shipboard, you know?

977
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:36,160
He was particularly mortified
at having to sail past here at dinner time,

978
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,920
which means, let's see,
er, Barnard's Head...

979
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,080
Nine o'clock or thereabouts.
- Yes, sir.

980
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:44,320
What are they carrying, sir?
- Among other things, gold.

981
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:49,775
You must make quite certain.
I need the money very particularly.

982
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,840
I hope the wind drops after.

983
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,080
I'm an indifferent sailor.
- What?

984
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:59,080
I'm going to take a little holiday.
I advise you to do the same.

985
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,665
Why? What's happened? Is...
- Nothing yet.

986
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,480
But the authorities sent Mr Trehearne
down into Cornwall.

987
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,580
You see, they suspect.

988
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,960
I shall come back when it's blown over.

989
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,060
Then it's the last one?

990
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,040
It's the last of this series.

991
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:20,480
I shall catch the Falmouth packet tonight
for St-Malo.

992
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,095
I shall call back on the way,

993
01:03:22,195 --> 01:03:24,520
so have the gold and
valuables ready for me.

994
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:27,760
They're extremely fond of
such things in France.

995
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,860
What about Trehearne?

996
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,195
When will your men be here?

997
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,600
If this is what saving your life
has brought us all to, I wish...

998
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,590
You don't think I'm enjoying this?

999
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,420
(Raucous laughter)...

1000
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,560
Is anything wrong?
SIR HUMPHREY: Oh, no.

1001
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,600
Our friend made a very elementary joke.

1002
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,000
We're ready.
I've locked the women in the bedroom.

1003
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,720
Everything, in fact, except the man himself.

1004
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,040
Your groom left just before us.
An hour and a quarter there and back.

1005
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,960
Which means Captain Boyle should be here
within ten minutes.

1006
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,168
There's only one way you
might save your skin.

1007
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:28,000
Name the man and tell the whole story.

1008
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,419
I took the precaution of
bringing this warrant...

1009
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,920
...for the fellow's apprehension.

1010
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:36,120
His name will have to be filled in later
when we know it.

1011
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,025
Like to write it in for us, Joss?

1012
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:43,760
You've taken all the risks so far,
you and Harry and Salvation and the rest.

1013
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,520
And what have you got out of it?
The bare pickings.

1014
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,745
Have you thought of that?

1015
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,041
You've a chance to break
free of him for good.

1016
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:52,680
Turn king's evidence. Why don't you?

1017
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,760
Do you think he'd hesitate
in your shoes? No.

1018
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,740
A man like that would
save his own skin first.

1019
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,840
You think so?

1020
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,047
He'd sacrifice anybody.

1021
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:01,360
You seem to have a very
clear picture of him.

1022
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,000
What sort of a fellow do
you think he really is?

1023
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:08,360
This man deliberately plans the wrecking
of ships and the cold-blooded slaughter...

1024
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,160
...of any who survive the wreck.

1025
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,680
He remains aloof,

1026
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:14,720
content to hire the scum
to do his murderous work for him,

1027
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,920
thinking there's no blood on his own hands,
but there is, blood on his soul...

1028
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:22,600
...(Downstairs door bangs open)
- The military.

1029
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:26,936
Watch him. I'll go down and
tell them to surround...

1030
01:05:27,036 --> 01:05:31,286
...the place and to lie
low till we give the word.

1031
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,890
Oh, what a beauty.
- (Laughter)

1032
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,060
Stay where you are.

1033
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,900
You devil.

1034
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:45,760
Sir Humphrey.

1035
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:49,240
Look out. Some of the gang are here.
- He's got somebody with him.

1036
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:52,655
See nobody gets outside.
- Sir Humphrey.

1037
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:58,555
There's no other way.
HARRY: Are you up there, Joss?

1038
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,220
Joss?

1039
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,200
(Harry whistles)

1040
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,300
Squire Pengallan?

1041
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,847
That's right. Your respected
justice of the peace...

1042
01:06:13,947 --> 01:06:16,000
...brought here by your pal Mr Trehearne.

1043
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:20,160
Who forgot to tell you he's a law officer.
- What's that?

1044
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:24,960
What do you think?
They came here to hang us over the wreck.

1045
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:29,055
We'll make a real job of
it this time. Come on.

1046
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,940
Hold on.

1047
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,760
We've got to go careful.
- What's the matter?

1048
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:43,800
We don't want our justice of the peace
found here dead. People might talk.

1049
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,200
He won't be found.
- But he might be missed.

1050
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,240
Maybe they knew he was coming here.

1051
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:50,080
We've got to finish him.
- Surely,

1052
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:56,130
but that takes a little thinking over
and there's no time for that now.

1053
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,680
We're doing another wreck.

1054
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,520
Tonight?
- Nine o'clock.

1055
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,760
We'll fix them when we come back.

1056
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,600
Get a couple of ropes there.

1057
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,700
JOSS: Chairs.

1058
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,045
No, I'll do him. It'll be a pleasure.

1059
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:21,000
Do you think I came here just for you?
I told you, there's somebody behind Joss.

1060
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,249
If you wait here long
enough, you'll see him.

1061
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:24,520
He's coming here tonight.

1062
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,200
You shut your gab.
Playing for time, are you?

1063
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,862
You'd like to see us miss
that wreck we're doing...

1064
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,960
...tonight. We wouldn't miss it for worlds.

1065
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,800
Joss, finished trussing His Worship?

1066
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,040
Let's make 'em nice and snug.

1067
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:40,440
And while we're away, we've got to think
of a nice little accident for you.

1068
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:42,480
Now, what would Your Worship fancy?

1069
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,520
A choice coach over the cliffs?

1070
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,861
Or perhaps you'd sooner
be caught by the tide...

1071
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:48,200
...with our friend Jem here...

1072
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,840
...on a nice, comfortable,
cosy part of the beach.

1073
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,520
That's it. In death they shall not be divided.

1074
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:57,160
I warn you, all of you, if you lay a finger
on either of us, you'll pay for it.

1075
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,844
You'll end swinging in the wind at

1076
01:07:58,944 --> 01:08:01,200
Execution Dock with tar
to keep the weather out.

1077
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,440
It's time we went.
- Well, who's going to stay with them?

1078
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,800
What about Salvation?
He can talk to Mr Trehearne about eternity.

1079
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,680
SALVATION: Him? Not me.

1080
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:13,069
We'll need all hands on
shore. Patience'll watch...

1081
01:08:13,169 --> 01:08:15,000
'em. The women are locked in the bedroom.

1082
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,360
I'm sorry to see you here, Willie Penhale.

1083
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,458
I told you when you were up before me...

1084
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:21,760
...for poaching you were
among evil companions.

1085
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,175
You should have listened to me, my boy.

1086
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:29,554
It looks as though your
wish is going to come...

1087
01:08:29,654 --> 01:08:32,880
...true. You might just as well have left me.

1088
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,320
What's she doing here?
- She came here to warn us.

1089
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,853
She started the whole
thing. I don't see why...

1090
01:08:37,953 --> 01:08:38,960
I'll look after her.

1091
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:42,920
I've got a nice job for you, Patience.
Take this and watch the two gentlemen.

1092
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,132
HARRY: You can't leave
a woman in charge.

1093
01:08:45,232 --> 01:08:47,080
I'll need you lot down at the beach.

1094
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,502
They're tied. This is all
the better for a finger...

1095
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:51,240
...that's nervous, like, on the trigger.

1096
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,557
I shouldn't move, bearing that in mind. You...

1097
01:08:53,657 --> 01:08:56,120
...wouldn't like your suit
spoiled with a bullet hole.

1098
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,640
You'll have no call to use it, most likely.

1099
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,160
Come on. Look lively now.

1100
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,280
Patience, you can't leave them like...
- You're coming with us.

1101
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:06,240
Take your hands off her.
You can't take her to the wreck.

1102
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,982
Of course not. I'm going to leave her behind...

1103
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,840
...to cut you loose for the
second time in 24 hours.

1104
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,480
Come on now.

1105
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:14,800
Merlyn.

1106
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,640
You'll answer to me for her safety.

1107
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,740
Yes, Your Worship.

1108
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,120
(Door is bolted)...

1109
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:31,360
What's happened to the military?
- Something must have delayed them.

1110
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,960
If they'd come, we could save the wreck.
- We don't know where it's going to be.

1111
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,480
Our man came here, but he left before us.
- How do you mean?

1112
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,520
Or Joss wouldn't have
known about the wreck.

1113
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:44,800
I warn you, Mrs Merlyn, if Captain Boyle
finds you like that, nothing will save you.

1114
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,040
This is very annoying.
I told Chadwick I'd be back for dinner.

1115
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,400
Mrs Merlyn,

1116
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,240
I wonder if that pistol is loaded.

1117
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:54,640
You're inexperienced in these things.
Would you like me to look?

1118
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,240
That'll never work.
- Very well, Mrs Merlyn.

1119
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:01,040
Let's see if it's properly primed.
You're not fully conversant with the facts.

1120
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,455
I know your husband better than you do.

1121
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,920
He would no more have loaded that pistol
than he would have left me helpless,

1122
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,995
which would have been quite absurd.

1123
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,060
As I thought.

1124
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,540
Now, Mrs Merlyn.

1125
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:21,040
I've always admired
your devotion to your husband.

1126
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,720
The woman shall cleave to the man,
even if the man is our friend Joss.

1127
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:28,900
Admirable. Now, if this
officer should escape...

1128
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:31,360
...your husband will pay for it with his life,

1129
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:34,880
so I needn't stress the importance
of the task I'm giving you.

1130
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,980
There.

1131
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,840
Watch him. Closely.

1132
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:44,933
If there's the slightest
chance of him getting free,

1133
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,160
don't hesitate to shoot him.

1134
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,200
Just get firm pressure on the trigger.

1135
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,840
On the trigger.

1136
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,940
And all will be well.

1137
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,660
No.

1138
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,800
JEM: You've forgotten one thing.

1139
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,680
Captain Boyle.
There's still the military to reckon with.

1140
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,990
There is no Captain Boyle.

1141
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,420
In consequence, there'll be no military.

1142
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,340
(Door slams shut)

1143
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,720
Mrs Merlyn, you've got to let me go.

1144
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,812
Quick.
- Please. Don't move.

1145
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,240
JOSS: Whoa. Take her
round. Take her round.

1146
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,340
Whoa.

1147
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,160
Up to the beacon with you. Quick.

1148
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,630
Can't I join in the wreck?

1149
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:49,920
When you're grown to a man's size, maybe.

1150
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:53,080
I never see anything.
- Off with you.

1151
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,460
(Harry whistles)

1152
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,960
Would you like me to bring
you back a nice ring?

1153
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,400
Not including the finger, if you follow me.

1154
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,570
Come down out of there.

1155
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,910
Hold on to her, Catchpole.

1156
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,640
Mrs Merlyn, where is
the wreck going to be?

1157
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:40,280
I don't know.

1158
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,720
You can't let it happen.
You must set me free.

1159
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:46,120
Innocent men and women are going to die.
You'll be responsible.

1160
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:50,280
You love your husband, I know that.
And I know it's my duty to take him if I can.

1161
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,440
But the men on that ship have wives, too.

1162
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,880
Think of yourself if Joss was on board.

1163
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:57,640
That ship sailing down
from Falmouth in the gale.

1164
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,280
Somewhere on the shore,
a beacon is going out.

1165
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,120
Can you see the rest?

1166
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,625
The ship striking. Men spread out like flies,

1167
01:13:04,726 --> 01:13:07,240
clinging to the rigging,
screaming at the surf.

1168
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:09,280
And after the wreck, the wolves.

1169
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,320
That's why you must let me go.
Tell me where that wreck is.

1170
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,760
I can't. I can't. I don't know, I tell you.

1171
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,600
I've never known.

1172
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,700
Mrs Merlyn.

1173
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,920
Let me go now and I'll find out where it is.

1174
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,840
Hurry. There's hardly time.

1175
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,880
I can't. What will happen to Joss?

1176
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:29,414
You must make a choice.
The lives of those men...

1177
01:13:29,514 --> 01:13:31,440
...and of other men in the future or Joss?

1178
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,680
After all, Joss is only one man.

1179
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:35,780
Yes, but he's my man.

1180
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:42,805
Mrs Merlyn, supposing
I allow your husband...

1181
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,900
Hey.

1182
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:06,280
Whoa-up.
- Where's the nearest military garrison?

1183
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,120
Bodmin. Why?
- I want your coach.

1184
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:13,405
Give me those reins in the name of the law.
Here's my warrant.

1185
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:27,420
There she is. Look.

1186
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:45,410
HELMSMAN: A light. Barnard's Head.
MURRAY: Hard a'port.

1187
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,220
(Angry cries from gang)

1188
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:11,280
She's the one that did it.

1189
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:15,035
Women are no good here,
bring you bad luck.

1190
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,160
All right, Joss. You leave her to us.

1191
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:20,320
We'll manage very nicely. Thank you.

1192
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,880
DANDY: I'm sure you'll agree, Harry.

1193
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:26,160
This calls for my attention.
This is where I come into my own.

1194
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,400
Let her go. Get into that cart quick.

1195
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,160
Keep back there.

1196
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,960
You can't take her.
- She's robbed us of our best cargo ever.

1197
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,320
Fetch her down.
MARY: Robbed you? Thank heaven.

1198
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,556
Robbed of your chance to
stuff your pockets...

1199
01:17:37,656 --> 01:17:39,840
...by murdering innocent
devils you've never seen.

1200
01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,760
I'm glad. I don't care what happens.

1201
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:45,600
I'm glad.
- Shut your mouth, you little fool.

1202
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,520
I don't know how long my
business will take me.

1203
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,160
I may be away for some weeks.
- Very good, sir.

1204
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,000
Sir Humphrey.
- What is it, Sam?

1205
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:06,760
I couldn't deliver this note.
The regiment left Truro three weeks ago.

1206
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,800
Nobody's heard of any Captain Boyle.
- Extraordinary.

1207
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,640
Shall I try Bodmin?
- No, no, it's of no importance.

1208
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:18,095
That'll be all, Chadwick.
I can't give you my address in France.

1209
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,480
Sir.
- What?

1210
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,240
Well, er, Chadwick?

1211
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,920
You'll pardon the liberty.

1212
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,020
You're not ill?

1213
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,200
III, Chadwick?

1214
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,720
III?

1215
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:39,240
I've never felt better in my life.

1216
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,340
Come here.

1217
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,480
The fact is I'm, er...

1218
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,240
...growing younger.

1219
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:46,760
Come here.

1220
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,150
So much younger I'm taking...

1221
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:50,280
...a beautiful young girl
with me on my travels.

1222
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:52,640
Yes, sir. Is there anything more?

1223
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:53,740
Yes, you fool.

1224
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,400
Don't stand there with
that look in your eyes.

1225
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,040
Sam.
- Sir?

1226
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,960
Keep the mare and bay
in good condition, won't you?

1227
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,060
And, er, come here.

1228
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,100
Watch Chadwick.

1229
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,880
His mind's going.

1230
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,800
Hm.

1231
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,705
SIR HUMPHREY: Drive on, will you.

1232
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:17,880
Mr Chadwick.

1233
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,640
He's, erm...

1234
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:22,970
I've seen that coming along for years.

1235
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,565
Aunt Patience. Aunt Patience.

1236
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,405
Aunt Patience. Aunt Patience.

1237
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,400
Mary. Joss. What's happened?

1238
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:41,120
Joss is hurt.

1239
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,220
Careful, Joss. Joss.

1240
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,560
Mary.

1241
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,660
(Joss coughs)

1242
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:52,360
Mary. Mary, what happened?

1243
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:58,920
I stopped the wreck. The men came for me
and Joss saved me and they shot him.

1244
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,820
(Coughs)

1245
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,820
Uhh.

1246
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,500
Joss, Joss.

1247
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,300
Oh, Patience.

1248
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,900
Patience, my dear.

1249
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,240
You're all right, Joss. I'm taking care of you.

1250
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,854
You're a good girl, Patience.

1251
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,220
I'm sorry.

1252
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,480
Where's Jem? Aunt Patience, he's not?

1253
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,240
I set him free.

1254
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,550
He went to find the wreck.

1255
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:53,160
Mary, he promised me he'd let Joss escape.

1256
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,532
You know what that means.
We can leave here.

1257
01:20:55,632 --> 01:20:57,640
We can leave here together, Joss and I.

1258
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:00,760
You must help me, Mary.
We must go quickly while we can.

1259
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,520
Mary, we'll begin again.

1260
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,440
Think of it. To be able to live without fear...

1261
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,380
...among different people
who don't know us.

1262
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,480
Yes, Aunt Patience.

1263
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:10,600
It'll be like those first days in Bodmin.
Joss was different then.

1264
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,360
He's strong.

1265
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:15,180
He'll soon get better, won't he?

1266
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,300
(Coughs)
- Of course.

1267
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:21,840
When he's recovered a
little, we must move him.

1268
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:25,280
We can't wait. Joss mustn't be here when...
when he comes back.

1269
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,640
Who?

1270
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:28,880
Oh, Mary, I haven't told you.

1271
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:32,046
I didn't know myself until
tonight, but I've always...

1272
01:21:32,146 --> 01:21:34,000
...known Joss wasn't his own master.

1273
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,056
There's someone else who
planned the wrecks...

1274
01:21:36,156 --> 01:21:37,240
...and had Joss in his power.

1275
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,280
Tonight I found out who. Mary, it's...

1276
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,380
...(Gunshot)

1277
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,365
Aunt Patience. Aunt Patience.

1278
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,500
Life without Patience?

1279
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:00,620
Get me a drink.

1280
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,820
Yes, Joss, yes.

1281
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,370
A good, clean shot, wasn't it?

1282
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:36,220
I'm sorry.

1283
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:39,720
Poor creature. She has suffered so much.
But I was forced to do it, you see.

1284
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:44,160
She was going to tell you about me.
I didn't like that.

1285
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,640
I wanted to tell you myself.

1286
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:52,160
So, you stopped the wreck?
Pity. I was counting on it.

1287
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:56,360
You're a very brave young lady,
but you've made my position very difficult.

1288
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:59,760
Let me go. Let me go.
- Please don't scream like that.

1289
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:02,703
I shall have to put this handkerchief...

1290
01:23:02,803 --> 01:23:06,080
...in your mouth. You must
tell me if that hurts.

1291
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,200
Of course, you can't. How silly of me.

1292
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,785
Put your hands down.
Put your hands down.

1293
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,880
Or I shall have to tie them up, too.

1294
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,220
Right.

1295
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:25,010
This will prevent the cord
from cutting your wrists.

1296
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:28,960
You see, you're quite alone now.

1297
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:30,960
You have no-one else in the world.

1298
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,920
Except myself.

1299
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,825
So I'm going to take care of you.

1300
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:40,218
Er... in fact, we're going away together.

1301
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,040
We should be going now.
Trehearne may come back.

1302
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,080
You'd better put this on.

1303
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,400
It's wise to wrap up well,
while this cold wind is blowing.

1304
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,960
I'm always telling people
they can't be too careful.

1305
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,000
But they think they know better.

1306
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:59,000
And you wouldn't want people
to see you like that, would you?

1307
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,360
There.

1308
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:04,453
I'm er... glad you're quiet now.

1309
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:11,380
Now, come along.

1310
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,934
My coach is not far away.

1311
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,250
(Mary sobs)

1312
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,780
But we must hurry.

1313
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,820
We must hurry.

1314
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,620
We must hurry.

1315
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,900
HARRY: Sir Humphrey.

1316
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,480
And the girl's with him.

1317
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:45,640
But Joss, what about Joss?
- Come on.

1318
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,360
DANDY: Trehearne's gone, too.

1319
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,460
ALL: Joss. Joss.

1320
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,050
SALVATION: Harry, here. Quick.

1321
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:03,740
Dead. Both of them.

1322
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:08,520
You shouldn't have done
that to Joss, Harry.

1323
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:13,075
If you ask me, it's er... time we moved on.

1324
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:21,040
What are you all standing
there for? Get out.

1325
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,605
Don't keep together. Scatter.

1326
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,620
Soldiers.

1327
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:34,360
Now, where's that girl?

1328
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,280
That's the question.
- Come on now, where is she? Tell me.

1329
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:38,755
Take it calm now, take it calm.

1330
01:25:38,855 --> 01:25:40,920
You're going to be
disappointed, Mr Trehearne.

1331
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,360
She's gone and found herself
another gentleman.

1332
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:45,920
I just seen her sneaking off alone
with His Worship.

1333
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,056
The squire.

1334
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,160
We've got to find them, Captain.

1335
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:55,445
Sergeant, I want six men
to ride with Mr Trehearne and myself.

1336
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,280
I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

1337
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:05,800
It was breaking that...
that bit of looking glass that did it.

1338
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,790
I told you. Seven years' bad luck.

1339
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:11,680
No, Dandy, not more than seven days.
Not counting eternity.

1340
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:13,640
What'll they do? What'll happen to us?

1341
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,768
Lt'll be a proper public execution...

1342
01:26:15,868 --> 01:26:18,400
...with the women watching.
I'll make 'em sit up.

1343
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,500
I'm ready. Ready.

1344
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:27,120
That won't do, will it?
- Better tie him up.

1345
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,220
Why are you doing that?

1346
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,200
Why can't I be chained? Stop.

1347
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,240
Stop. I want to be chained like the others.

1348
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,340
Listen to me.

1349
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:39,120
I've got a right to be. I'm the same as them.
I've done what they've done, haven't I?

1350
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:41,345
I want to hang with them.

1351
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:44,220
You'll hang me.

1352
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:46,260
I don't want to hang.

1353
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,320
I don't want to die. Not yet.
I'm only a boy. I'm only 1 7.

1354
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:51,360
You won't let them, will you?

1355
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:54,200
I only did what I was told.
I never killed anybody.

1356
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:56,240
I never even went near the wrecks.

1357
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:58,960
So you can't hang me.
You mustn't. You daren't.

1358
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:01,000
Because I don't want to die.

1359
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,395
(Sobs) I don't want to die.

1360
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,220
(Harry whistles)

1361
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,139
There's my house. Do you see?

1362
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,300
Across the bay.

1363
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,640
The Pengallans have
been there a long time.

1364
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,865
I may never see it again.

1365
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,440
Because, you see,
we may never be able to come back.

1366
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,480
We may be going a long way, you know.

1367
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,520
Nearer the sun, of course.

1368
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:40,595
Italy perhaps. The Isles of Greece.

1369
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:42,560
You're thinking that'll cost money,

1370
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:44,600
but there, I have enough.

1371
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:47,055
One must have enough.

1372
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,960
I always knew that to live like a gentleman,

1373
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:54,338
spaciously and with elegance,
one must have money.

1374
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:59,685
And a few beautiful possessions, of course,
like you, my dear.

1375
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,227
Where's Sir Humphrey?

1376
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:14,240
Sir Humphrey has gone away on business.

1377
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:16,000
Where?
- Answer, man, answer.

1378
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:19,520
Sir Humphrey is taking
the Falmouth night packet to St-Malo.

1379
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:22,600
I say, I say, what's this? Oh, it's you.

1380
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,700
Good heavens. My suit.

1381
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,160
These gentlemen
are enquiring for Sir Humphrey, sir.

1382
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:31,228
Sir Humphrey is the head
of a band of wreckers...

1383
01:28:31,328 --> 01:28:34,643
...who are under arrest at Jamaica Inn.

1384
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:44,020
(Clock chimes)

1385
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:09,360
HAWKER: Sweet China oranges.

1386
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:11,460
Sweet China.

1387
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:17,560
I've put your luggage below, sir.

1388
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:20,200
Sir Humphrey Pengallan.
The large stateroom.

1389
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,840
Are you the steward?
Get me a bottle of brandy.

1390
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:26,425
Very good, sir. This way, sir. Follow me.

1391
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:35,955
What a miserable hole.
Is this the best they've got?

1392
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,580
Old traveller, though.

1393
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,975
I'll make you comfortable.

1394
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:47,120
I never really cared for wrecking.

1395
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:50,560
After all, not my kind of thing,
hobnobbing with cut-throats.

1396
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:53,680
It had to be done.
Half my friends living like paupers.

1397
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:59,390
But I'm living like a prince.
Drowned hundreds of sailors to do it.

1398
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,380
But like a prince.

1399
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:06,600
And I'll make a princess out of you.

1400
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:25,280
I believe you're sorry,
because you're not marrying some oaf,

1401
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:30,659
who'd father on you a dozen
snivelling, dirty-nosed brats.

1402
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:38,133
Any man of sensibility
would rather see you dead first.

1403
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:44,620
Gangplank away.

1404
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:46,660
(Crowd shout goodbyes)

1405
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:50,440
In Paris you'll have your
woman to attend to you.

1406
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,480
I'll see to your new clothes myself.

1407
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,920
Yes, I'll dress you, my dear.

1408
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:59,865
And we'll put silk
next to that smooth skin of yours, hmm?

1409
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:03,040
Pale green silk, I think, what?

1410
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:05,140
(Mary sobs)...

1411
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,220
...(Sir Humphrey laughs)

1412
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:09,220
Pah. Stop crying.

1413
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:11,385
Stop it, you little fool.

1414
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:16,040
Be beautiful. Hard as nails if you like,
but you must be beautiful.

1415
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:19,760
Well, you have to be hard now.
The age of chivalry has gone.

1416
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:21,860
(Horses approaching)

1417
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:29,480
CAPTAIN JOHNSON:
That's it. Bring her back to the quayside.

1418
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:32,320
SIR HUMPHREY:
Troopers. They may be coming for you.

1419
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,280
Of course, you can't go with them.

1420
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,120
You shouldn't have done that, my child.

1421
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:40,895
Lots of riffraff about.
Things might be most unpleasant.

1422
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,660
(Mary screams)

1423
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:56,100
Captain Johnson.

1424
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:58,140
I'm here.

1425
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,220
Sir Humphrey Pengallan.

1426
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,240
Give yourself up, I beg you, Sir Humphrey,
and let her go.

1427
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,160
Pray, keep your distance.

1428
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,810
Careful. Wing him if possible.

1429
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,120
Take care.
Lean away from him as far as you can.

1430
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:13,560
No, don't shoot. He can't help himself.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

1431
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,174
He's mad, I tell you. Mad.

1432
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:21,840
It's safer here.

1433
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:24,915
SAILOR: Port bow line ashore there.

1434
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:30,780
It must be now.

1435
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,970
Please be still.

1436
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,720
Jem, don't harm him.
It's not his fault. He can't help himself.

1437
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:52,820
JEM: Come down.

1438
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,520
Come down from the rigging
and give yourself up.

1439
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,620
Come down.

1440
01:32:57,660 --> 01:32:59,700
Come down, Sir Humphrey.

1441
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:06,732
Come down, sir. Come down.

1442
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:10,810
Good heavens,
what's the squire doing up there?

1443
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,720
JEM: Come down, Sir Humphrey,
and give yourself up.

1444
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:20,000
You'll not be harmed, I promise you.
Come down, sir.

1445
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,300
I shall be down to you
before you're up to me,

1446
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:24,400
Mr Trehearne.

1447
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,985
If you'll be kind enough to give me room.

1448
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,850
OFFICER: Bring that man down.
- All right, sir.

1449
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:44,200
SIR HUMPHREY: What are
you all waiting for?

1450
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,040
A spectacle?

1451
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:48,140
You shall have it.

1452
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:51,720
And tell your children
how the great age ended.

1453
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:54,573
Make way for Pengallan.

1454
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,700
(Screaming)...

1455
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:59,740
...(Thud)

1456
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:26,655
SIR HUMPHREY'S VOICE: Chadwick.

1457
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,020
(Fainter) Chadwick.

1458
01:34:30,305 --> 01:34:36,905
