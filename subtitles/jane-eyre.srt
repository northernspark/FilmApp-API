2
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,159
I will die

3
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,319
St. John?

4
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,479
I found her
at the door.

5
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,959
She's white as death

6
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,639
Hannah,
some of that hot milk.

7
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,079
St. John, we would
have stumbled upon
her corpse in the morning.

8
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,319
And she would
have haunted us for
turning her away.

9
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,359
- She's no vagrant.
- I'm sure of it.

10
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,119
There's milk for you.

11
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,399
Here.

12
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,199
Ask her her name.

13
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,359
What's your name?

14
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,839
YOUNG JOHN REED
Jane Eyre.

15
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,319
Tell us how
we may help you.

16
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,559
Your name?

17
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,279
YOUNG JOHN REED
Where are you?

18
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,319
Must hide

19
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,079
St. John, we must
get her warm.

20
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,959
ST. JOHN
Let us take her upstairs

21
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,639
Will she die?

22
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,519
Where are you, rat?

23
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,519
I know you're here.

24
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,599
If you crawl out and say,
"Forgive me, Master Reed,"

25
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,799
I might consider it.

26
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,719
Mama
John

27
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,039
There you are.

28
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,039
That book
belongs to me, rat.

29
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,119
It belongs to
my Uncle Reed.

30
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
Spoilt, miserable brat!

31
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,479
- Mama!
- For shame!

32
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,759
Mama!

33
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,159
You wretched imp

34
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,439
She attacked me

35
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,559
I hate you, John Reed!
I hate you!
Hilary, take her! Take her!

36
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,599
Lock her in the red room

37
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,999
No!

38
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,199
Please, please!
No, it's haunted. Please
It's haunted! No!

39
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,399
Please! Please

40
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,639
If you don't sit still
you will be tied down

41
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,439
What we do is
for your own good.

42
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,919
Pray for forgiveness,
Miss Eyre,

43
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,879
or something bad will
come down that chimney
and fetch you away.

44
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,519
Let me out, please!
Have mercy, Aunt Reed
Please

45
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,759
Do you know, Jane Eyre,
where the wicked
go after death?

46
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,119
They go to hell.

47
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,919
And what is hell?

48
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,479
A pit full of fire.

49
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,359
Should you like
to fall into this pit

50
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,079
and be burned
there forever?

51
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,919
No, sir.

52
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,239
How might
you avoid it?

53
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,759
I must keep in good
health and not die.

54
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,959
What is her parentage?

55
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,799
She's an orphan

56
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,439
Her mother was
my husband's sister.

57
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,919
On his deathbed
he exhorted me
to care for her.

58
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,039
I have always treated her
as one of my own.

59
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,599
If you accept her
at Lowood School,
Mr. Brocklehurst,

60
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,119
keep a strict eye on her

61
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,879
She has a heart of spite

62
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,439
and I'm sorry to say
that her worst fault
is that of deceit.

63
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,439
You can rest assured

64
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,439
that we shall root out
the wickedness

65
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,239
in this small,
ungrateful plant.

66
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,199
And as
for its vacations,

67
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,879
it must spend them
all at Lowood

68
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,959
You may leave.

69
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,839
You said I was a liar.
I'm not.

70
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,399
If I were,
I should say I loved
you, and I don't.

71
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,759
I dislike you worse
than anybody
in the world.

72
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,239
People think you are good
but you're bad
and hard-hearted

73
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,039
I'll let everyone know
what you have done.

74
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,839
Children must be corrected
for their faults.

75
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,159
Deceit is not my fault.

76
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,959
But you are passionate

77
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,479
My Uncle Reed is in heaven,
so are my mother and father.

78
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,319
They know how you hate
me and wish me dead.
They can see.

79
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,199
They see everything
you do and they will
judge you, Mrs. Reed

80
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,519
Get out.

81
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,919
- Next.
- Show me your hands.

82
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,559
Stop there

83
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,439
Very grand

84
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,599
Next.

85
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,119
Step out
of your fine dress.

86
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,199
Stay there

87
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,559
Show me your hands

88
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,519
My name
is Jane Elliott.

89
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,239
Who can we send
for to help you?

90
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,399
No one.

91
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,799
I mustn't ever be found.

92
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,239
Join me to Thyself

93
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,599
with an inseparable
band of love.

94
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,759
For Thou,
even Thou alone,

95
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,639
dost satisfy him
that loveth Thee.

96
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,599
And without Thee
all things are vain
and empty

97
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,479
Amen

98
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,639
Amen.

99
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,279
It's wonderful to see
you up, Miss Elliott

100
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,039
Last week we thought
we'd be escorting your remains

101
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,639
to an unmarked grave.

102
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,079
She read
The Bride of Lindorf

103
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,679
and suddenly it's all
woebegone maidens
and dramatic deaths.

104
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,759
I'm sorry to have
caused so much trouble.

105
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,839
Nonsense.

106
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,599
You're the
most exciting thing
that's happened here

107
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,719
since St. John's
sermon on the
fall of Babylon

108
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,039
I hope I'll not
be eating long at your
expense, Mr. Rivers.

109
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,079
Then tell me where
to place you.

110
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,039
Show me where to seek
work, that is all I ask.

111
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,039
You're not fit enough
to work. Is she, Di?

112
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,119
No. Stay with us

113
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,319
You return to your posts
at the end of the month.

114
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,959
What must
Miss Elliott do then?

115
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,719
I'll endeavor to help you,

116
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,599
if that's what you wish.

117
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,759
With all my heart, sir.

118
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,599
This school you
were at, Miss Elliott,

119
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,679
this charitable institution

120
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,039
what did it prepare you for?

121
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,399
Was it a thorough education?

122
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,119
Most thorough

123
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,399
A little wit...

124
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,839
A little wit...

125
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,279
will serve

126
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,359
a fortunate man

127
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,679
Again. A little wit...

128
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,999
A little wit

129
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,399
will serve

130
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,119
a fortunate man

131
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,279
Burns!

132
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,359
I will not have you
before me in that attitude.

133
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,599
All rise

134
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,119
I see you are mortifying
this girl's flesh.

135
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,039
Sir, she was not..

136
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,079
It is your mission
to render her contrite
and self-denying.

137
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,439
Continue.

138
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,079
The new girl.

139
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,359
This is the pedestal
of infamy,

140
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,159
and you will remain
upon it all day long.

141
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,519
You will have neither
food nor drink,

142
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,159
for you must learn
how barren is the
life of a sinner.

143
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,559
Children, I exhort you
to shun her, exclude her,

144
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,639
shut her out
from this day forth.

145
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,079
Withhold the hand
of friendship

146
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,839
and deny your love
to Jane Eyre

147
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,599
the liar.

148
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,439
How do you bear
being struck?

149
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,919
Miss Scatcherd hits me
to improve me.

150
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,279
She's tormented
by my faults.

151
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,639
If she hit me,
I'd get that birch

152
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,039
and break it
under her nose.

153
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,559
She'd find another
soon enough.

154
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,879
My father used to preach
that life's too short

155
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,759
to spend in nursing
animosity.

156
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,199
At my aunt's house,
I was solitary
and despised.

157
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,039
She thought I could do
without one bit of
love or kindness.

158
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,959
You are loved

159
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,599
There's an invisible world
all around you

160
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,439
a kingdom of spirits
commissioned to
guard you, Jane.

161
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,959
Do you not see them?

162
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,439
Jane?

163
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,999
Have you something
for me to do?

164
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,119
You're doing
something already

165
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,599
May I see?

166
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,919
These are wonderful.

167
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,279
St. John

168
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,959
No, Mary, please...

169
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,159
See how skilled Jane is.

170
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,639
Is this how
you perceive me,
Miss Elliott?

171
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,759
Well. How fierce I am.

172
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,479
Jane.

173
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,639
You're freezing.
Your little feet are bare.

174
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,359
Come into bed
and coveryourself.

175
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,359
How are you?

176
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,439
I'm happy, Jane.

177
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,039
I'm going home.

178
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,439
Back to your father?

179
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,559
I'm going to God

180
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,999
Don't be sad.

181
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,039
You have a passion
for living, Jane.

182
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,079
And one day you'll
come to the region of bliss.

183
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,759
Don't leave me.

184
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,759
I like to have you near

185
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,639
I will not leave you.

186
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,999
No one shall
take me from you

187
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,119
Helen!

188
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,119
Helen!

189
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,399
Mr. Rivers? I wondered
if you had yet heard
of any work I could do.

190
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,639
I found you a situation
some time ago,

191
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,599
but I've delayed telling you
because the work is lowly
and I fear you'll scorn it.

192
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,879
I shan't mind what I do.

193
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,999
When I took over
the parish two years ago
it had no school

194
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,719
I opened one for boys
I now intend to
open one for girls.

195
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,679
The schoolmistress
will have a cottage paid
for by benefactors

196
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,959
and she'll receive
£15 a year.

197
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,279
You can see how humble,
how ignoble it is.

198
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,279
Mr. Rivers,
thank you.

199
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,599
I accept.

200
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,839
With all my heart

201
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,239
But you comprehend me?

202
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,159
'Tis a village school
cottagers' daughters

203
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,559
What will you do
with all your fine
accomplishments?

204
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,959
I will save them
till they're wanted.
They will keep.

205
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,319
Jane.

206
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,039
You will be quite
alone here.

207
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,559
I'm not afraid
of solitude.

208
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,239
This is my first home
where I am neither dependent

209
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,679
nor subordinate to anyone.

210
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,679
Thank you, Mr. St. John

211
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,759
It is small and plain
as I told you.

212
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,959
Then it'll suit me
very well.

213
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,119
Safe journey,
Miss Eyre. Godspeed.

214
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,279
Goodbye, Miss Eyre

215
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,119
Safe journey.
Thank you.

216
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,639
Bye, Miss Eyre.

217
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,439
Girls!

218
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,439
Goodbye

219
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,639
Thornfield, Miss.

220
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,999
Wait here, Miss

221
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,799
How do you do,
my dear?

222
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,479
Are you Mrs. Fairfax?
Indeed I am

223
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,039
What a tedious journey
you must have had.

224
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,559
Your hands must
be frozen. Here.

225
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,039
Goodness.
How young you are.

226
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,359
I'm quite experienced
I can assure you

227
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,879
Of course you are.
I'm sure we're very
lucky to have you.

228
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,959
Leah, would you
ask Martha to bring
a little hot port

229
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,439
and cut a sandwich or two?

230
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,159
Draw nearer the fire

231
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,359
John is taking your trunk
up to your room.

232
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,399
I've put you at the
back of the house
I hope you don't mind

233
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,919
The rooms at the
front have much
finer furniture,

234
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,239
but they're so gloomy
and solitary, I think.

235
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,079
I'm glad you're come.

236
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,999
To be sure, this is
a grand old house,

237
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,039
but I must confess that
in winter one can fee
a little dreary and alone

238
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,439
Leah's a very nice girl,
and John and Martha
are good people, too,

239
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,919
but they are servants.

240
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,479
One cannot talk to them
on terms of equality

241
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,039
Am I meeting
Miss Fairfax tonight?

242
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,439
Who?

243
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,679
Miss Fairfax
my pupil?

244
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,679
Oh, you mean Miss varens,
Mr. Rochester's ward.

245
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,719
She's to be your pupil

246
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,519
Who's Mr. Rochester?

247
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,639
Why, the owner of Thornfield.
Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester.

248
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,919
I thought Thornfield Ha
belonged to you.

249
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,359
Bless you, child,
what an idea. Me?

250
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,199
I'm only the housekeeper

251
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,639
Forgive me.

252
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,719
There is a distant
connection between
Mr. Rochester and me

253
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,239
his mother was a Fairfax,
but I'd never presume on it.

254
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,119
Heavens. Me,
owner of Thornfield?

255
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,319
We shall have a cheerful
house this winter

256
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,679
With Miss Varens
here and with you,

257
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,079
we'll have quite
a merry time of it.

258
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,039
I'm sure that last winter,
and what a severe one it was,
if it didn't rain it snowed,

259
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,079
if it didn't snow it blew.

260
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,759
I declare, not one sou
came to the house from
November to February.

261
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,079
When spring finally came,
I thought it a great relief
I hadn't gone distracted.

262
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,519
I've had Martha lay a fire.
I hope you'll be comfortable.

263
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,799
Now, get that lot
turned over before
frost comes down

264
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,119
Do you want
the upper bit doing
as well?

265
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,559
Yes

266
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,319
We must open the
window in the study today

267
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,639
to let in some air

268
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,399
I've never seen such
an ancient old house

269
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,399
How beautifully
you've preserved it.

270
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,199
Well, Mr. Rochester's visits
are always unexpected

271
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,159
He doesn't like
to arrive and find
everything all swathed up,

272
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,759
so I keep it in
constant readiness.

273
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,559
Now, come and
meet Miss Varens.

274
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,399
Did I mention
she's French?

275
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,839
Will you ask her
about her parents?

276
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,199
Mr. Rochester
neglected to tell me
anything about her.

277
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,439
Her mother
has passed away.

278
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,279
Adèle is going to show us
her accomplishments.

279
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,679
Oh!

280
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,679
How very French.

281
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,399
Very good.
Very good.

282
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,599
Now, we're going
to make a press
Shut the book up

283
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,839
Butterfly.

284
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,879
And what was it
before it was a butterfly?

285
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,399
Caterpillar

286
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,199
"I shall leave
and walk into town.'

287
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,879
"Do not go,"
begged her maid.

288
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,439
"The Gytrash roams
these hills."

289
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,399
A spirit of the North
that lies in wait
for travelers.

290
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,319
It tenants the
carcasses of beasts

291
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,839
possesses horses,
wolves, great dogs.

292
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,159
You know it
only by its eyes,

293
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,759
which burn as
red as coals,

294
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,239
and if one should
chance upon you

295
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,759
Nothing. A mere story

296
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,279
What nonsense

297
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,039
Whatever brings
you up here?

298
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,919
I've been waiting
to pour our tea.

299
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,119
I'm not in need of tea
thank you.

300
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,479
It's a quiet life,
isn't it?

301
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,959
This isolated house,
a still doom for
a young woman.

302
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,479
I wish a woman could
have action in her life,
like a man.

303
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,319
It agitates me to pain
that the skyline over
there is ever our limit.

304
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,159
I long sometimes
for a power of vision
that would overpass it

305
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,519
If I could behold
all I imagine...

306
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,639
I've never seen a city

307
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,319
I've never
spoken with men

308
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,599
And I fear my
whole life will pass

309
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,719
Now, exercise
and fresh air,

310
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,079
great cures for
anything, they say.

311
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,559
I have some letters to post
Will you take them?

312
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,959
Up! Up, you
cursed beast! Up

313
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,399
Stand back.
Are you injured, sir?

314
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,959
May I be of some help?

315
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,239
Where did you
come from?

316
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,359
Just below,
at Thornfield Hall.
I am the governess

317
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,759
I'm on my way
to post a letter

318
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,319
Can I fetch
someone to help?

319
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,919
The governess.

320
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,359
You may help me yourself.

321
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,919
Get hold of his bridle
and lead him to me.

322
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,279
If you would be so kind.

323
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,279
It would be easier
to bring me to the horse.
Come here.

324
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,799
I must beg of you
to please come here,
Miss Governess.

325
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,599
Hold it.

326
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,079
Make haste
with your letter

327
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,559
For who knows
what might lurk in
these dark woods.

328
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,799
Leah
go and light the fire in
the master's bedroom.

329
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,719
And tell Martha
to prepare for tea.

330
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,839
Yes, ma'am.

331
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,759
Mr. Rochester's here.

332
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,239
Go and change your frock.
He wishes to meet you.

333
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,439
Leah, take her cloak.
I have to change?

334
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,879
I always dress for
the evening when
Mr. Rochester's here.

335
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,599
But all my dresses
are the same.

336
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,879
You must have
one that's better.

337
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,359
He's in a terrible humor.

338
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,999
His horse fell
in Hay Lane, and
his ankle is sprained

339
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,999
He's at the doctor
this half hour
Where have you been?

340
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,959
Let her sit

341
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,799
I've examined Adèle
and I find you've taken
great pains with her.

342
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,519
She's not bright,
she has no talents,

343
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,639
yet in a short time
she's improved.

344
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,679
Thank you, Mr. Rochester.

345
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,519
You've been resident
here three months?

346
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,959
Yes, sir.

347
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,039
And from whence
do you hail?

348
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,839
What's your tale of woe?

349
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,399
Pardon?

350
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,999
All governesses
have a tale of woe.
What's yours?

351
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,719
I was brought up by my aunt,
Mrs. Reed of Gateshead,

352
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,559
in a house even
finer than this

353
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,039
I then attended
Lowood School,
where I received

354
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,239
as good an education
as I could hope for.

355
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,999
I have no tale
of woe, sir

356
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,359
Where are your parents?

357
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,479
Dead

358
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,359
Do you remember them?
No

359
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,439
And why are you
not with Mrs. Reed
of Gateshead now?

360
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,879
She cast me off, sir

361
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,119
Why?

362
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,639
Because I was burdensome
and she disliked me.

363
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,759
No tale of woe?

364
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,599
I daily thank providence
for sending us Miss Eyre.

365
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,879
She's an invaluable

366
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,399
Don't trouble yourself to
give her a character.
I'll judge for myself.

367
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,959
I have her to thank
for this sprain

368
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,319
Sir?

369
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,239
You bewitched my horse.

370
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,199
I did not.

371
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,519
Were you waiting
for your people
on that lane?

372
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,239
I have no people, sir

373
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,239
I mean for the imps
and elves and little
green men.

374
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,599
The sad truth is,
they are all gone.

375
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,319
Your land is neither wild
nor savage enough for them.

376
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,039
Adèle brought me these.
Are they yours?

377
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,519
Yes, sir.

378
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,079
Where did you
get your copies?

379
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,719
Out of my head

380
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,239
That head I now see
on your shoulders?

381
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,879
Yes, sir.

382
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,239
Who's this?

383
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,399
The evening star.

384
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,879
Were you happy when
you painted these?
Yes.

385
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,559
To paint is one of
the keenest pleasures
I have ever known.

386
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,839
Then your pleasures
have been few.

387
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,679
Are you satisfied
with them?

388
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,119
Far from it.
I imagine things I'm
powerless to execute

389
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,679
You've secured the
shadow of your thoughts.

390
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,799
Yet the drawings
are, for a schoolgirl,
peculiar.

391
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,079
Good night

392
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,159
Come, Adèle

393
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,919
Most merciful Father,

394
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,199
we give Thee humble
thanks for this,
Thy special bounty.

395
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,279
Amen

396
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,559
Amen.
Amen.

397
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,399
Sit nicely, please, Adèle

398
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,399
Pilot

399
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,959
Pilot, come here!

400
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,479
Go on,
further down!

401
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,999
By the river!

402
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,319
He's very abrupt
and changeful.

403
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,639
What manner
of man is he?

404
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,639
He's a good master.

405
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,999
He's fine company,
too, when he...

406
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,839
Except when he's
in an ill humor.

407
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,279
Adèle.

408
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,839
I hate to reload.

409
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,239
On three
One, two, three

410
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,199
Ready?

411
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,039
Oh!

412
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,159
Think that's it, sir.
Take it down to the river.

413
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,359
Come on

414
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,479
Keep it

415
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,559
Take it away and
disembowel it

416
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,759
Beautiful.
Miss Eyre.

417
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,839
I'm not fond
of children.

418
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,359
Nor do I particularly enjoy
simple-minded old ladies.

419
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,639
But you might suit me,
if you would.

420
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,599
How, sir?

421
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,239
By distracting me
from the mire of
my thoughts.

422
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,999
That is how Maman
used to say.

423
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,839
Precisely

424
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,719
And that's
how she charmed
my English gold

425
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,319
out of my English pocket

426
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,799
Let's go and try it on,
shall we?

427
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,559
Your gaze is very
direct, Miss Eyre.

428
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,319
Do you think me handsome?

429
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,319
No, sir.

430
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,159
What fault do
you find with me?

431
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,919
I have all my limbs
and features.

432
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,279
I beg your pardon, sir.

433
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,919
I ought to have replied
that beauty is of
little consequence.

434
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,599
You're blushing, Miss Eyre.

435
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,759
And though
you're not pretty any more
than I am handsome

436
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,599
I must say it becomes you.

437
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,319
And now I see
you're fascinated by
the flowers on the rug

438
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,919
Come, speak to me

439
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,799
Fact is, Miss Eyre,
I'd like to draw you out

440
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,519
you have rather
the look of another
world about you.

441
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,599
I don't wish to treat
you as inferior

442
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,359
Yet you'd command
me to speak?

443
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,879
Are you very hurt by
my tone of command?

444
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,999
There are few masters
who'd trouble to enquire

445
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,599
whether their paid
subordinates

446
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,159
were hurt by their commands.

447
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,599
Paid subordinate?
I'd forgotten the salary.

448
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,759
Well, on that
mercenary ground,

449
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,879
will you consent
to speak as my equal

450
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,279
without thinking that
the request arises
from insolence?

451
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,599
I'd never mistake
informality for
insolence, sir.

452
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,119
One, I rather like.
The other, nothing freeborn
should ever submit to.

453
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,399
Humbug.

454
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,879
Even for a salary.

455
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,999
Most free-born things
would submit to
anything for a salary.

456
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,159
But I mentally shake
hands with you
for your answer.

457
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,079
Not three in 3,000
schoolgirl governesses

458
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,519
would have answered me
as you've just done.

459
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,959
Then you've not
spent much time in
our company, sir.

460
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,639
I'm the same plain kind
of bird as all the rest,

461
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,319
with my common tale of woe

462
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,519
I envy you

463
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,119
How?

464
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,879
Your openness,
your unpolluted mind.

465
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,839
When I was your age,
fate dealt me a blow.

466
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,559
And since happiness
is denied me,

467
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,759
I've a right to get
pleasure in its stead.

468
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,119
And I will get it,
cost what it may.

469
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,199
Then you'll degenerate
still more.

470
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,999
But, Miss Eyre

471
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,479
if the pleasure
I was seeking was
sweet and fresh,

472
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,559
if it was an inspiration
if it wore the robes of
an angel of light,

473
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,679
what then?

474
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,039
To speak truth, sir,
I don't understand you at all.

475
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,839
I fear the conversation
has got out of my depth.

476
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,919
You're afraid of me.

477
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,239
I'm not afraid.
I've simply no wish
to talk nonsense.

478
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,799
Do you never laugh
Miss Eyre?

479
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,079
Only rarely, perhaps

480
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,079
But you're not
naturally austere,

481
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,879
any more than
I'm naturally vicious

482
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,959
I can see in you
the glance of a
curious sort of bird

483
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,959
through the close-set
bars of a cage,

484
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,639
a vivid, restless captive

485
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,079
Were it but free,
it would soar, cloud-high.

486
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,119
Leah,
have you seen Mrs. Poole?

487
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,199
Yes, ma'am.

488
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,159
The master's in no mood
for any more mistakes.

489
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,639
Who's there?

490
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,199
Wake up, sir!
Wake up! Sir
Wake up!

491
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,959
The quilt!
Give it here!

492
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,719
A noise aroused me
from my sleep.

493
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,319
What noise?

494
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,359
There was someone
at my door.

495
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,399
Stay here

496
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,039
Don't make a sound.

497
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,399
Say nothing about this.
You're no talking fool.

498
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,079
But...
I'll account for
this state of affairs.

499
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,639
Say nothing

500
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,839
Yes, sir.

501
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,119
Is that how you
would leave me?

502
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,159
Jane, fire is
a horrible death.

503
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,599
You've saved my life.

504
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,519
Don't walk past me
as if we were strangers.

505
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,199
But what am I to do then?

506
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,439
I've a pleasure in
owing you my life

507
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,399
There is no debt.

508
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,919
I knew you would do me
good in some way.

509
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,639
I saw it in your eyes
when I first beheld you.

510
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,319
Their expression did
not strike my very inmost
being so for nothing.

511
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,439
People talk of natural
sympathies. You...

512
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,199
Good night then, sir

513
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,839
You will leave me, then?

514
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,239
I am cold.

515
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,479
Go

516
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,919
Has Mr. Rochester
not sent for us today?

517
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,799
Why, he's gone away

518
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,319
Were you not aware?
He left after breakfast

519
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,239
He's gone to the Leas.
It's Mr. Eshton's place

520
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,279
I believe Blanche
Ingram is there.

521
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,079
She's a great
favorite of his

522
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,839
I saw her two years
ago when Mr. Rochester
gave a party here.

523
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,759
She's a most
elegant girl.

524
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,119
They sang a duet together.
They made a lovely harmony.

525
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,519
I was quite surprised
he didn't make a proposal,

526
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,839
but she has no fortune.

527
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,159
In every other way
they'd make
a splendid match.

528
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,399
Perhaps it's his
intention now.

529
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,999
He's far more likely to
have gone off to Europe

530
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,119
He often goes
without so much
as a fare-you-well

531
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,559
and I don't see
him for a year.

532
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,959
I collected
the burnt linen
from the master's room

533
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,959
That's fine
Just go make up the bed.

534
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,639
England is
a great power, Adèle.

535
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,679
British ships set sail
from here to the outer
limits of our empire,

536
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,479
navigating the five oceans
and four corners of our world.

537
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,359
From Canada, here,
all the way to the
south of Africa

538
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,119
and the Cape of Good Hope

539
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,879
Across the Indian Ocean,
to Australia and New Zealand,

540
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,399
and on to Burma, China,
India and Malaya.

541
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,999
Nothing.

542
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,999
On these distant horizons,
you will find all
manner of men.

543
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,639
He's coming
back tomorrow.

544
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,479
He's given me
directions to prepare
all the rooms.

545
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,719
I'm to get more staff
from the George Inn

546
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,519
Miss Ingram's coming.

547
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,839
Supplies to be got,
the linen, mattresses...

548
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,399
I'll go to the George now
No, no, I'll tell Martha...

549
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,559
May I assist you,
Mrs. Fairfax?

550
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,319
Oh

551
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,639
South-facing rooms
for Lady Ingram
and Miss Ingram.

552
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,359
Colonel Dent and Mrs. Dent
must have the river view.

553
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,839
I reckon
master's taken a fancy
to that Miss Ingram.

554
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,639
He may well have
asked her already

555
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,239
I'll wager
he will by end of week.

556
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,119
You mark my words

557
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,959
Adèle.

558
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,239
What's she saying?

559
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,879
Mr. Rochester is here.

560
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,639
Everybody out.

561
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,519
Edward.

562
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,119
Allow me,
Miss Ingram.

563
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,919
I'd forgotten
how masculine
Thornfield is

564
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,959
I think
you need more flowers.

565
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,079
I have
the fairest of all on my arm.

566
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,199
Come away, Adèle

567
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,239
Tonight, he wants both
of you in the drawing
room after dinner.

568
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,759
Not me, surely.

569
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,039
I'm instructed to tell you,
if you resist,

570
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,519
he'll come up
and get you himself.

571
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,279
But I don't have a dress.

572
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,839
Don't worry, child,
who'll notice?

573
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,759
Mademoiselle!

574
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,039
I thought you
were not fond of children,
Mr. Rochester.

575
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,319
Nor am I, Lady Ingram.

576
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,959
What induced you
to take charge of her?

577
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,919
She was
left on my hands.

578
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,799
Why don't you
send her to school?

579
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,679
She has a governess.

580
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,919
Poor child.
I had about half
a dozen in my day,

581
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,879
all detestable incubi.

582
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,719
It's true.

583
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,119
Mr. Rochester
beware the governess

584
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,919
Mama thinks
they're generally hysterics.

585
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,239
Or degenerates.

586
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,599
I thank heaven
I have done with them

587
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,919
It's a miracle
I survived my education.

588
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,639
I remember
Miss Wilson screaming,
"You villainous child!"

589
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,559
That's right. She tried
to set her hair on fire

590
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,599
Frequently, I might add.

591
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,039
Anyway, enough
of this dreary race.

592
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,479
We shall have music

593
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,159
and a new subject.

594
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,959
Signor Eduardo,
what shall it be?

595
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,279
I give you beauty.

596
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,039
There's nothing
new to be said.

597
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,079
I give you back
male beauty.

598
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,999
Well,
that's my son.

599
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,519
Hear hear.

600
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,479
A man should pay
no heed to his looks.

601
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,079
He should possess
only strength and valor.

602
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,279
Gentleman or highwayman,

603
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,239
his beauty lies
in his power.

604
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,599
Then a pirate
would do for you?

605
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,479
Why did you
leave the room?

606
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,239
I am tired, sir.

607
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,799
Why didn't you come
and speak to me?

608
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,759
I haven't seen you
for weeks.

609
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,319
It would have been normal
and polite to wish me
good evening.

610
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,479
You seemed engaged

611
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,879
You look pale.

612
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,879
I am well

613
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,679
What have you been doing
while I've been away?

614
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,319
Teaching Adèle

615
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,359
You're depressed.

616
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,879
What's the meaning of this?

617
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,799
Your eyes are full...

618
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,839
What is it?

619
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,039
There's a gentleman
to see you, sir.

620
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,599
From Spanish Town
Jamaica

621
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,759
And indeed I think
he does come from
some hot place

622
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,479
because he won't
take off his coat

623
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,919
Mr. Richard Mason

624
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,679
I've put him in
the morning room.

625
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,519
Have I done wrong?

626
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,159
Bring him to my study.

627
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,679
Jane, this is a blow

628
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,079
If I were to go
to those people

629
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,839
and they looked at me
coldly and sneered,

630
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,639
and then left me
one by one,

631
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,999
what would you do?
Would you go with them?

632
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,919
No, sir.
I'd stay with you

633
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,319
You'd dare condemnation
for my sake?

634
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,199
For the sake of any friend
who deserved it.

635
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,559
Richard.

636
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,599
Fairfax.

637
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,919
How the devil are you?

638
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,039
Splendid.

639
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,999
I'm sorry. I see
you have guests.

640
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,439
'Tis no trouble. Come.

641
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,279
What on Earth was that?

642
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,439
- Where is Rochester?
- Wait for me.

643
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:51,199
I'm here. Be composed
A servant has had
a nightmare, that's all.

644
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,079
I must see you back
into your rooms

645
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,199
because until
the house is settled,

646
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,759
she can't be
properly looked after

647
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,999
Is there
anything I might do?

648
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,439
Miss Ingram,
ladies, please

649
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,719
return to your nests
like the doves that you are.

650
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,039
I assure you
all is well.

651
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,119
Noisy old house.

652
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,959
Come, my lily flower

653
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,639
I told you
it was nothing.

654
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,279
Please.

655
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,799
Come with me.

656
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,159
Can you clean this?

657
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,799
Yes

658
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,599
Drink, Richard
It will give you the
strength you lack.

659
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,599
- Will it hurt me?
- Drink!

660
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,479
I must go for the doctor.

661
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,439
Sponge the blood
away when it returns.

662
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,639
Give him water
if he wants it

663
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,319
Do not speak to him
for any reason.

664
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,519
And, Richard

665
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,119
on pain of death,
do not speak to her.

666
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,719
How does he?

667
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,679
He is sleeping.

668
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,319
Hurry, Carter
Be on alert.

669
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,319
The sun will soon rise
and he must be gone.

670
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,559
Let's have a look,
shall we?

671
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,159
Flesh is torn
as well as cut

672
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,839
Very, very unpleasant

673
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,439
Fairfax
Drive!

674
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,999
It's a strange night
you've passed.

675
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,239
Yes, sir.

676
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,759
You showed no fear.

677
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,719
I was afraid of
the inner room

678
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,239
You were in no danger.

679
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,199
Mr. Rochester,
who did that violence?

680
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,119
I cannot tell you.

681
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,079
Why do you protect them?

682
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,319
I drag through life
a capital error.

683
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,319
Its consequence
blights my existence.

684
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,079
For years, I've sought
to escape it.

685
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,919
This spring,
I came home heart-sore
and soul-withered.

686
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,719
And I met a gentle stranger
whose society revives me.

687
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,319
With her, I feel
I could live again

688
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,719
in a higher, purer way

689
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,279
Tell me

690
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,399
am I justified in
overleaping an obstacle
of custom to attain her?

691
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,959
There is an obstacle?

692
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,999
A mere conventional
impediment.

693
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,839
But what can it be?

694
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,319
If you cherish
an affection, sir

695
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,559
then fortune alone
cannot impede you

696
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,479
Yes

697
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,479
And if the lady
is of noble stock

698
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:04,399
and has indicated that
she may reciprocate...

699
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,759
Jane, of whom do
you think I speak?

700
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,599
Of Miss Ingram

701
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:19,159
I'm asking what
Jane Eyre would do
to secure my happiness?

702
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,559
I would do
anything for you, sir.

703
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,079
Anything that was right.

704
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,919
You transfix me quite.

705
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,399
I feel I can speak
to you now

706
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,799
of my lovely one

707
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,119
for you've met her
and you know her.

708
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,239
She's a rare one
isn't she?

709
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,679
Fresh and healthy,

710
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,119
without soil or taint.

711
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,159
I'm sure
she'll regenerate me
with a vengeance.

712
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,839
You look
ridiculous.

713
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,999
This game
is ridiculous.

714
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,519
Excuse me, sir

715
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,319
Does that creeping
creature want you?

716
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,759
Excuse me.

717
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,479
This is from my
old nurse, Bessie.

718
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,319
She says my cousin
John Reed is dead.

719
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,519
He squandered his fortune
and has committed suicide.

720
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,999
The news has so
shocked my aunt

721
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,399
it's brought on a stroke.

722
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,759
What, the aunt
who cast you out?

723
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,599
She's been asking for me

724
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,439
I parted from her badly
and I can't neglect
her wishes now.

725
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,999
Promise me
you won't stay long

726
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,959
Mr. Rochester
I've had no wages

727
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,799
I need funds for my journey.

728
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,839
How much do I owe you?

729
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,479
Thirty pounds.

730
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,159
Here's 50

731
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,679
That's too much.

732
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,079
Take your wages, Jane

733
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,639
I cannot.

734
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,399
Then I only have 10.

735
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,879
Now you owe me.

736
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,639
Indeed I do

737
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,839
Meantime, I shall
safeguard it here.

738
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,599
Do you trust me
to keep it?

739
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,719
Not a whit, sir.

740
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,999
You are not to be
trusted at all.

741
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,879
Jane Eye.

742
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,239
I've twice done
you wrong.

743
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,679
And I broke the vow
I made to Reed.

744
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,799
Please, don't think of it.

745
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,559
Open that box

746
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,559
Take out the letter
and read it.

747
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,159
"Madam,

748
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,919
"will you have the goodness
to send me

749
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,599
"the address of my
niece, Jane Eyre?

750
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,119
"I desire her to come
to me at Madeira.

751
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,799
"Fortune has blessed
my endeavors,

752
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,879
"and as I am childless,
I wish to adopt her

753
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,199
"and bequeath her at my death
whatever I may have to leave

754
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,119
"Yours, John Eyre, Madeira."

755
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,639
This is dated three years ago.
Why did I never hear of it?

756
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,759
Because I wrote
and told him

757
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,639
you'd died of typhus
at Lowood School.

758
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,559
You called the names
of the dead
down upon me.

759
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,439
You cursed me

760
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,599
I would have loved you
if you'd let me.

761
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,959
You were born
to be my torment.

762
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,399
Then love me or
hate me as you will.

763
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,439
You have my full
and free forgiveness.

764
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,719
Be at peace.

765
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,319
My dear uncle,

766
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,999
Some years ago,
my Aunt Reed mistakenly
informed you that I had died.

767
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,599
I am writing to tell you
that I'm very much alive

768
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,999
and gratified to find
I have a relative.

769
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,759
I look forward to
our correspondence,

770
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,519
hoping one day we may meet.

771
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,359
I'm currently living
at Thornfield Hall,

772
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,479
where I am governess
to the ward of
Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester.

773
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,119
Ah. There you are.

774
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,039
Just like one
of your tricks,

775
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,199
to steal in along
with the twilight.

776
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,479
If I dared I'd touch you
to see if you were real

777
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,839
Come, Jane

778
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,719
Stay your wandering feet
at a friend's threshold.

779
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,639
Thank you, Mr. Rochester,
for your great kindness.

780
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,719
I'm strangely glad
to get back again.

781
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,279
There's been
nothing official yet,

782
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,159
but he's ordered
jewels from his bank

783
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,919
and he's making preparations
to travel to Europe.

784
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,679
Mademoiselle.

785
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,839
He's taken to singing,

786
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,439
the operas Miss Ingram
favors so well.

787
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,359
We'll hear
their announcement
soon, I'm sure.

788
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,279
You are to be married.

789
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,799
I see Mrs. Fairfax has
intimated my intention

790
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,919
to put my neck
into the sacred noose.

791
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,199
Adèle should
go to school,

792
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,519
and I must seek
another situation.

793
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,919
Congratulations, sir

794
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,759
Thornfield is a pleasant
place in spring, isn't it?

795
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,439
Yes, sir.

796
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,439
You'll be sorry
to part with it.

797
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,839
It's always the way
with events in life.

798
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,319
No sooner
have you got settled

799
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,519
than a voice cries,
"Rise and move on!'

800
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,479
I'll find you
a new situation, Jane,

801
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,719
one I hope
that you'll accept.

802
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,919
I shall be ready
when your order
to march comes

803
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:06,839
Must I really lose
a faithful paid subordinate
such as yourself?

804
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,039
You must.

805
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,679
We've been good friends
haven't we?

806
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:14,839
Yes, sir.

807
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,199
I've a strange feeling
with regard to you

808
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,359
as if I had a string
somewhere under my left ribs,

809
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,399
tightly knotted to
a similar string in you.

810
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,159
And if you were to leave

811
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,239
I'm afraid that
cord of communion
would snap.

812
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,159
And I've a notion
that I'd take to
bleeding inwardly

813
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,879
As for you,
you'd forget me

814
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,119
How?

815
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,919
I have lived
a full life here.

816
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,279
I have not been
trampled on.

817
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,599
I have not
been petrified.

818
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,399
I have not been
excluded from every
glimpse of what is bright

819
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,039
I have known you,
Mr. Rochester,

820
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,439
and it strikes me
with anguish to be
torn from you.

821
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,639
Then why must you leave?

822
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,759
Because of your wife

823
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,919
I have no wife.

824
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,559
But you are
to be married.

825
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,319
Jane, you must stay

826
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,279
And become
nothing to you?

827
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,159
Am I a machine
without feelings?

828
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:26,279
Do you think that
because I am poor,
obscure, plain and little

829
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,359
that I am soulless
and heartless?

830
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,759
I have as much soul as you
and full as much heart.

831
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,239
And if God had blessed me
with beauty and wealth,

832
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,079
I could make it as hard
for you to leave me

833
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,759
as it is for I
to leave you.

834
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,239
I'm not speaking to you
through mortal flesh.

835
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,119
It is my spirit that
addresses your spirit

836
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:48,399
as if we'd passed
through the grave and stood
at God's feet, equal,

837
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,999
as we are.
As we are.

838
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,079
I am a free human being
with an independent will

839
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,959
which I now exert
to leave you.

840
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,119
Then let your will
decide your destiny.

841
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,639
I offer you my hand,
my heart.

842
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,479
Jane,

843
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,679
I ask you to pass
through life at my side.

844
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,519
You are my equal
and my likeness.

845
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,879
Will you marry me?

846
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,239
Are you mocking me?

847
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,199
Do you doubt me?

848
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,039
Entirely

849
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,239
Your bride is Miss Ingram

850
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,439
Miss Ingram?

851
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,279
She is the machine
without feelings.

852
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,119
It's you. You rare
unearthly thing

853
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,879
Poor and obscure
as you are

854
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,919
please accept me
as your husband.

855
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,879
I must have you for my own.

856
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,279
You wish me
to be your wife?

857
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,279
I swear it.

858
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,879
You love me?

859
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,519
I do.

860
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,239
Then, sir,
I will marry you

861
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,799
Good night.
Good night, my love.

862
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,079
Good night

863
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,239
Am I a monster?

864
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,279
Is it so impossible
that Mr. Rochester
should love me?

865
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,799
No.

866
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,599
I've long noticed
you were a sort
of pet of his

867
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,879
But you're so young
and you're so little
acquainted with men

868
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,319
I don't want to
grieve you, child

869
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,959
but let me just put
you on your guard.

870
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,199
Gentlemen in his position

871
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,719
Well, let's just say

872
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,239
they're not accustomed
to marry their governesses

873
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:44,639
Until you are wed,
distrust yourself
as well as him.

874
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,439
Please,

875
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,319
keep him at a distance.

876
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,599
Come.

877
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,359
What is it?

878
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,519
Jane Eyre with
nothing to say?

879
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,879
Everything seems unreal

880
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,959
I am real enough

881
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,839
You, sir, are most
phantom-like of all.

882
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,079
I will be Jane Eyre
no longer.

883
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,559
Edward!

884
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,319
Move it!

885
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,359
Have the carriage
loaded and ready
within the hour.

886
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,919
Take courage, Jane

887
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,319
I will.

888
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,479
Come on

889
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,239
I require
and charge you both,

890
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,359
as you will answer
at the dreadful Day
of Judgment,

891
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,359
when the secrets
of all hearts
shall be revealed

892
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,199
that if either of you
do know of any impediment

893
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,959
why you may not be
joined together lawfully,

894
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,879
you do now confess it

895
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,479
Edward Fairfax Rochester

896
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,959
The marriage cannot go on

897
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,759
An insurmountable
impediment exists.

898
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,119
Proceed.

899
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,279
"I affirm
and can prove...

900
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,599
Proceed!

901
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,999
"...That Edward Fairfax
Rochester was,

902
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,719
"15 years ago,
married to my sister,

903
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,879
"Bertha Antoinetta Mason,
at St. James' Church,

904
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,519
"Spanish Town, Jamaica."

905
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,399
A copy of the register
is now in my possession

906
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,279
Signed, Richard Mason

907
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,239
She lives at
Thornfield Hall

908
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,479
This girl knew
nothing of this.

909
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,239
She thought all
was fair and legal.

910
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,119
She never dreamt
she was being entrapped

911
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,519
into a feigned union
with a defrauded wretch

912
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,559
Come, Jane

913
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:38,679
Come, all of you.
Meet my wife.

914
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,439
Get back!

915
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,159
Go, all of you. Go!

916
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,519
You're 15 years too late.

917
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,359
Mrs. Poole.

918
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,399
You ought to
give warning, sir

919
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,319
This is Bertha
Antoinetta Mason.

920
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,039
My wife.

921
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:13,639
- Antoinetta.
- It's I, Richard.

922
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:18,759
She has her quiet
times and her rages.

923
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:23,439
The windows are shuttered
lest she throw herself out.

924
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,159
We have no furniture,
as she can make a weapon
out of anything.

925
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,799
I take her for a turn
upon the roof each day,
securely held,

926
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,239
as she's taken to
thinking she can fly.

927
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,199
My own demon.

928
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,199
Jane.

929
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,279
Forgive me. I'm worthless.
How could I?

930
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,799
Jane.

931
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,479
No tears.

932
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,879
Why don't you cry?

933
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,599
Why not scream at me?
I deserve a hail of fire.

934
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,079
I need some water
Of course.

935
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,599
Jane.

936
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,079
How are you now?

937
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,519
I will be well again soon.

938
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,079
I know you.
You're thinking.

939
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,639
Talking is of no use,
you're thinking how to act

940
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,439
All is changed, sir.
I must leave you.

941
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,079
No. No

942
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:00,239
Jane, do you love me?

943
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,119
Then the essential things
are the same.

944
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,279
Be my wife.

945
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,839
You have a wife.

946
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,559
I pledge you my
honor, my fidelity

947
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:19,639
You cannot.

948
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:21,879
My love, until
death do us part.

949
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,279
What of truth?

950
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,159
I would have
told you the truth

951
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,199
You are deceitful, sir!

952
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,319
I was wrong
to deceive you.

953
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,039
I see that now.
It was cowardly.

954
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,559
I should have appealed
to your spirit as I do now

955
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,119
Bertha Antoinetta Mason

956
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,919
She was wanted by
my father for her fortune

957
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,039
I hardly spoke with her
before the wedding.

958
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,599
I lived with her
for four years.

959
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,279
Her temper ripened,
her vices sprang up

960
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,719
violent and unchaste.

961
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,319
Only cruelty would check her,
and I'd not use cruelty.

962
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,279
I was chained to her
for life, Jane.

963
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,199
Not even the law
could free me.

964
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,599
Have you ever set foot
in a madhouse, Jane?

965
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,399
No, sir.

966
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,919
The inmates are caged
and baited like beasts.

967
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,079
I spared her
that at least.

968
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,639
Jane.

969
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,839
I earnestly pity you, sir

970
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,919
No.

971
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,079
Who would you offend
by living with me?

972
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,999
Who would care?

973
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,799
I would.

974
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,039
You'd rather drive
me to madness

975
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,759
than break some
mere human law?

976
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,359
I must respect myself.

977
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,479
Listen to me.

978
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,599
Listen.

979
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,079
I could bend you
with my finger
and my thumb,

980
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,959
a mere reed you fee
in my hands

981
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,359
But whatever I do
with this cage

982
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,039
I cannot get at you

983
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,999
And it is your soul
that I want.

984
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,039
Why don't you come
of your own free will?

985
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,439
God help me!

986
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:56,519
Jane!

987
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,879
I asked how you were

988
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,639
I'm getting on very well.

989
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,639
Do you find the
work too hard?

990
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,039
Not at all

991
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,239
Is the solitude
an oppression?

992
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:26,759
I hardly have time
to notice it.

993
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,239
Thank you, girls

994
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,559
Yes, ma'am

995
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,159
Then perhaps
you are dwelling
on things past.

996
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,919
When I came to your door
I had nothing

997
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,919
Now I have a home and work,
free and honest.

998
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:47,279
I thank God
for the generosity
of my friends.

999
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,039
What you had left
before I met you,
I don't know.

1000
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,559
But I counsel you
to resist firmly

1001
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,959
every temptation
to look back.

1002
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,799
That's what I intend to do.

1003
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,399
A year ago, I was myself
intensely miserable.

1004
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,879
I scorned this weakness,

1005
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,999
fought hard against it
and won.

1006
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,039
I wonder if we
do not share
the same alloy

1007
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:22,039
You are ambitious,
I think.

1008
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,399
And this little school
will not hold you for long.

1009
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:33,839
Is this yours?

1010
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,119
Yes

1011
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,279
What's the matter?

1012
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:40,959
Nothing.

1013
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,999
Good night

1014
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,519
Jane.

1015
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,199
Miss Eyre.

1016
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,999
What brings you
from your hearth
on a night like this?

1017
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:56,319
There is no bad
news, I hope

1018
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:00,039
How easily alarmed
you are, Miss Eyre.

1019
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,319
Please, won't
you sit down?

1020
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,359
Thank you, Miss Eyre

1021
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:15,479
I saw an advertisement
in The Times from
a solicitor named Briggs

1022
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,599
inquiring of a Jane Eyre

1023
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,199
I knew a Jane Elliott.

1024
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,879
This paper
resolved my suspicion
into certainty.

1025
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,279
And so, I wrote to him

1026
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,079
He told the story of
a young governess.

1027
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,639
And her employer,
a Mr. Fairfax Rochester

1028
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,559
Mr. Rivers

1029
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,679
I can guess your feelings
but please hear me.

1030
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:49,039
As you know so much,
perhaps you'll tell
me how he is?

1031
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,159
Who?
Mr. Rochester.

1032
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,359
I'm ignorant of
all concerning him.

1033
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,919
But he has
been seeking me?

1034
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,919
No, he hasn't.

1035
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:03,159
Mr. Briggs has

1036
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:05,719
And what does
he want with me?

1037
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,039
Merely to tell you
that your uncle

1038
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:12,319
Mr. John Eyre of
Madeira, is dead,

1039
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:15,159
that he has left you
all his property

1040
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,719
and that you
are now rich.

1041
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,239
What?

1042
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,919
You are rich,

1043
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,239
quite an heiress.

1044
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,319
Will you ask how
much you are worth?

1045
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,359
How much am I worth?

1046
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,879
Twenty thousand pounds.

1047
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,559
If you had committed
a murder

1048
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,239
and I'd found you out,
you could scarcely
look more aghast.

1049
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,839
There must be
some mistake.

1050
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,359
Not at all

1051
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:50,879
You look desperately
miserable about it,
I must say

1052
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,439
Please,

1053
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:58,559
sit down
I've shocked you

1054
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,159
Mr. St. John.

1055
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,159
The debt I owe to you
and your sisters...

1056
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,639
Is nothing

1057
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,119
You saved my life.

1058
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,439
Please write to them

1059
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,519
This money frees us.

1060
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,879
They will have 5,000 each

1061
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:39,279
and so will you,
if you'll take it.

1062
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,439
Certainly not

1063
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,759
And if you would accept
me as a sister,

1064
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:42,959
perhaps we could
live together,

1065
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,079
at Moor House.

1066
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,919
I told you the
news too quickly

1067
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,359
You're confused

1068
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,159
My only relative is dead.

1069
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,719
You have family.

1070
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,639
You cannot know
what isolation means.

1071
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:56,839
And you cannot know
what it means
to be wealthy.

1072
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,399
I have been alone always

1073
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,479
I've never had
a brother or sisters.

1074
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,719
Please, let me be yours.

1075
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,959
Are you reluctant
to have me?

1076
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:13,319
No, Miss Eyre

1077
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,159
On the contrary

1078
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,079
I shall write
to my sisters,
as you request

1079
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,919
Brother

1080
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:31,239
We are bid to work
while it is day.

1081
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:35,479
For night cometh,
when no man shall work.

1082
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,319
Help us to choose
the harder path,

1083
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,239
for as our master
is long-suffering,

1084
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,519
so must we be

1085
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,999
Amen

1086
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:50,879
Amen.
Amen.

1087
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,079
Good night.
Good night.

1088
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,079
Good night

1089
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,239
Is Jane not
our sister, too?

1090
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,199
Good night

1091
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,199
Jane.

1092
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,319
I go to India
in six weeks.

1093
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,839
I can see what
your gifts are

1094
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,119
and why they were given.

1095
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,039
God intended you
for a missionary's wife

1096
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,519
I want to claim you.

1097
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,599
I'm not fit for it.

1098
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,599
I trust you
unreservedly

1099
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,239
And know this,

1100
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,599
in you,

1101
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,279
I recognize
a fellow soul.

1102
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,199
I'll go with you
to India.

1103
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:22,359
Jane.

1104
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,039
I'll go if
I may go free.

1105
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,319
Free?

1106
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,439
How can I take out
to India a girl of 19
unless she is my wife?

1107
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,319
I love you as a brother
As a husband, no

1108
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,519
My heart is mute

1109
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:40,559
Then I must speak for it

1110
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:43,239
You've said you'll come.

1111
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,999
We shall marry

1112
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,639
And undoubtedly
enough of love
would follow.

1113
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:52,559
Enough of love?

1114
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,079
Yes, quite enough

1115
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:57,079
Of love?

1116
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,919
Yes. In all its forms.

1117
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,839
Forgive me, but
the very name of love

1118
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,799
is an apple of discord
between us.

1119
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,839
My dear brother,
abandon your
scheme of marriage

1120
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,759
Why this refusal?

1121
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,919
It makes no sense

1122
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,039
I earnestly wish
to be your friend

1123
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,399
You can't give
half a sacrifice.

1124
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,279
You must give all

1125
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,519
To marry you
would kill me!

1126
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:27,839
Kill you?

1127
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,839
Those words are
unfeminine and untrue

1128
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:37,799
I know where your heart turns
and to what it still clings.

1129
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:42,879
Say his name

1130
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:47,799
Say it. Say it

1131
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,879
Jane.

1132
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,719
Why have you not
yet crushed this
lawless passion?

1133
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:57,999
Jane!

1134
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:00,919
It offends me and
it offends God!

1135
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,679
What is it?

1136
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,159
Where are you?

1137
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,279
Wait for me.

1138
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,719
Why do you speak to the air?

1139
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:14,159
Jane.

1140
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,559
Jane.

1141
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:19,519
I am coming
Jane!

1142
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,439
Wait, please, Miss.

1143
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:40,359
Jane Eyre.

1144
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,639
I thought
gypsies were come.

1145
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:48,599
And then I saw you
and I thought
it cannot be

1146
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:50,319
you are a ghost.

1147
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,399
No one knows
how it started

1148
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:00,879
I expect that Mrs. Poole
took too much of
the gin and water

1149
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,839
and as she slept,
the lady,

1150
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:05,599
Mrs. Rochester,
unhooked the keys.

1151
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,359
She did what she failed
to do a year ago,

1152
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,799
set the whole place
to fire.

1153
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,599
We would have
all perished
in the smoke,

1154
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:19,159
but Mr. Rochester
would not rest till
we were all safe.

1155
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,279
Then he went
in for her

1156
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,279
The flames were
tearing up so high

1157
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,719
it brought men running
from the village.

1158
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,639
I saw her standing
on the roof.

1159
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,799
The very edge.

1160
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,959
I heard Mr. Rochester
beg her to come down

1161
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,239
But she jumped.

1162
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:41,559
Mr. Rochester remained,

1163
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:45,119
as if he would not move
until the fire consumed him.

1164
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,839
I didn't know

1165
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:52,679
I didn't know
it was his wife
I promise you

1166
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,159
Why did you
run away, child?

1167
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,119
I would have helped you.

1168
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,959
I had some money saved.

1169
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:03,679
You could have come to me.

1170
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:09,719
Where is he?

1171
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:53,119
Pilot.

1172
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:09,399
Who's there?

1173
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,839
This hand...

1174
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:02,079
Jane Eyre.

1175
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,679
Edward, I am
come back to you.

1176
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:24,039
Fairfax Rochester
with nothing to say?

1177
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,719
You are altogether
a human being, Jane.

1178
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,959
I conscientiously
believe so.

1179
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,719
A dream.

1180
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:02,079
Awaken then.

1181
01:54:03,305 --> 01:54:09,375
