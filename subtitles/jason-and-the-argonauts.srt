2
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,008
Well?

3
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,773
Zeus, king of the gods
of the Greeks...

4
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,736
...write in the ashes
so that I may read the future.

5
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,115
I see...

6
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,788
...a great tree
at the end of the world.

7
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:47,417
And in its branches there hang
the skull and the skin of a ram.

8
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,545
They gleam and shine...

9
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:53,423
...for it is a prize of the gods,
a Golden Fleece.

10
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:57,719
We've no time for riddles
and mysteries. Tell me of tonight.

11
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,686
Pelias, you will conquer tonight.

12
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:08,438
You will overthrow
the kingdom of Thessaly.

13
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,900
You will kill the king, Aristo,
and wear his crown.

14
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,903
You will do all these things
without fear or wound...

15
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,738
...because Zeus commands it.

16
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:21,785
If I'm protected by Zeus,
I will have no need of this.

17
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:25,247
I will lay it on the fire
as a thank offering to the gods.

18
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,291
Pelias...

19
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:32,462
...it is also foretold that although
you will win the throne of Aristo...

20
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,633
...you will, when Zeus ordains,
lose it...

21
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,469
...to one of Aristo's children.

22
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:45,518
- Then Aristo will have no children.
- He has three, Pelias.

23
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:49,272
Two daughters,
Philomela and Briseis...

24
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,566
...and a son, Jason.

25
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:55,904
Then two daughters and a son
will die with their father tonight.

26
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:13,399
Hera, queen of gods, protect
this child, my sister Philomela.

27
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:16,068
And if I, Briseis, am worthy...

28
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:18,404
...take me into your protection.

29
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,766
Are you Briseis,
the daughter of Aristo?

30
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:50,061
Be silent. She is praying.

31
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:55,859
For her sister
and for her murdered father, Aristo.

32
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,194
Are you a priestess?

33
00:05:58,362 --> 00:05:59,863
I serve the gods.

34
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:03,825
Then tell me, has Briseis
called upon the goddess Hera?

35
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:05,035
She has.

36
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,871
And has the goddess
heard her prayer?

37
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,622
Yes.

38
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:12,959
Then pray for me.

39
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,507
It is the will of Zeus.

40
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:22,761
It is not the will of Zeus.
It is your will.

41
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,305
Zeus has given you a kingdom.

42
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:28,475
The rest will be your own doing.

43
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:35,648
The gods abandon you, Pelias.

44
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:37,984
A one-sandaled man shall come...

45
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:41,488
...and no god shall protect you
from him.

46
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:43,782
A one-sandaled man?

47
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,453
The child who has escaped you:
Jason.

48
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,628
Then why was I not told
the whole prophecy?

49
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:59,507
Why did Zeus drive me
to kill this girl...

50
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:02,468
...when the only one I needed to kill
was Jason?

51
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:05,429
Zeus cannot drive men
to do what you have done.

52
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:07,848
Men drive themselves
to do such things...

53
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:09,767
...that the gods may know them...

54
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:13,145
...and that men
may understand themselves.

55
00:07:13,313 --> 00:07:16,690
The killing of Jason
would do you no good.

56
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:22,029
Kill Jason and you kill yourself.

57
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:44,093
Zeus, my godly husband,
did you, for some reason...

58
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,763
...order the profanation
of my temple in Thessaly?

59
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:49,266
That was entirely
the thought of Pelias.

60
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:52,394
Not content with winning the throne
of Thessaly, as I wished...

61
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:56,148
...he tried to avoid losing it
as I have commanded.

62
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:03,155
I know that you've
been insulted, my dear.

63
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:06,408
But be content.
The boy, Jason, has escaped.

64
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,910
- He will avenge you.
- How?

65
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:12,664
You must know by now I never arrange
exact and precise details...

66
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:16,376
And because you are neither exact
nor precise, a young girl was killed...

67
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:19,171
...and my temple was profaned.

68
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:23,675
- I want to help Jason.
- No.

69
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:26,761
You may help the infant, Philomela,
if you wish. She's a girl.

70
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:28,471
The rest is man's work.

71
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,309
No. I want to help Jason.

72
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,477
As you wish.

73
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:38,690
How many times did Aristo's daughter
Briseis call upon you?

74
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:42,027
- By name?
- Five.

75
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:45,155
Well, then you can help
her brother five times.

76
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:49,452
Five times only you can help him
to overthrow Pelias.

77
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,246
And that is my final word.

78
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:55,708
It will be 20 years
before Jason becomes a man.

79
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:59,337
Oh, an instant of time
here on Mount Olympus...

80
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:03,466
...but a long 20 years
for King Pelias.

81
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:09,305
He cautiously travels
the roads of Thessaly.

82
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:13,768
Yes, Pelias, you have had years
of watching and waiting...

83
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:16,145
...for the man
who must come to kill you.

84
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:19,482
The man with one sandal.

85
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:34,516
I owe you my life.

86
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:37,019
That was as good a way
to ford a river as any.

87
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:39,730
But I seem to have lost a sandal
in doing it.

88
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,732
Where are you traveling?

89
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,317
To the palace of the king.

90
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:46,361
- Pelias?
- Pelias of Thessaly.

91
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:49,824
Then I can put you on your way.

92
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:55,663
But first, you must accept
the hospitality of my camp.

93
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,457
Come.

94
00:11:25,778 --> 00:11:27,612
Be seated.

95
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,431
You have not yet
told me your name.

96
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,726
I am Jason,
the lawful king of Thessaly.

97
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:02,398
One of my father's soldiers rescued
me and brought me up in exile.

98
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:04,483
Now I've returned
to claim my kingdom.

99
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:07,903
I have waited for you for 20 years.

100
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:10,489
And in that 20 years,
Pelias has turned my kingdom...

101
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:14,326
...from the pride of Greece
to a savage, evil land.

102
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:15,828
I shall need your help.

103
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:20,916
When your father defended his throne,
no man fought harder than I.

104
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,627
This time it will not
be enough to fight.

105
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,129
I could fight.

106
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:27,756
I could find Pelias and kill him.

107
00:12:27,924 --> 00:12:29,758
But the people need more
than a leader.

108
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:33,262
They must believe
the gods have not deserted them.

109
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:36,640
- They need a miracle.
- And where will you find this miracle?

110
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:39,351
I have heard there is a tree
at the end of the world...

111
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,020
...with a fleece of gold
hanging in its branches.

112
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,689
I have heard this too.

113
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,941
So have many men.

114
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:48,569
They say it is a gift of the gods.

115
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:53,199
It has the power to heal, bring peace
and rid the land of plague and famine.

116
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:56,369
If I could find this prize
and bring it home to Thessaly...

117
00:12:56,537 --> 00:13:00,665
...then it would inspire the people,
wipe out the years of misrule.

118
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,084
They would know the gods
have not abandoned them.

119
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:05,044
My land would be
rich and strong again...

120
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:09,090
...as it was before this tyrant, Pelias,
murdered my father.

121
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:10,383
Jason...

122
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:13,094
...be advised by me.

123
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:15,555
First, search for this Golden Fleece.

124
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:18,892
Do not reveal yourself to Pelias,
but build a ship...

125
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,561
...and find a crew,
and when you have this prize...

126
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,396
...then and only then...

127
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,858
...return and kill Pelias.

128
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,367
And now rest yourself.

129
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:39,913
My companions are yours
to command.

130
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:49,047
Father, why do you let him live?

131
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:54,011
If I destroy him, Acastus,
I destroy myself.

132
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,263
While he is searching
for the Golden Fleece...

133
00:13:56,431 --> 00:14:00,100
...he is at the ends of the earth
and I am safe.

134
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:02,436
And if he finds it?

135
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:05,940
You will be there.

136
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:18,911
Have you come to pray
to the gods, Jason?

137
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:23,290
If I had, I wouldn't
have chosen a fallen one.

138
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,126
Only a statue.

139
00:14:27,295 --> 00:14:30,256
Sometimes the gods argue
amongst themselves.

140
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:31,966
Then great winds blow...

141
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:33,801
...and temples fall.

142
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,637
- Hermes.
- Yes?

143
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:41,767
No, I said the statue
was the god Hermes.

144
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:45,688
- Hermes.
- Yes.

145
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:50,150
A bringer of dreams
and a prowler of the night.

146
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:52,821
Jason.

147
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,620
No man can tell you
how to find the fleece.

148
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:05,375
Is it not time you asked the gods?

149
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,670
They will not answer
those who believe in them.

150
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:10,797
Why should they answer one
who doesn't?

151
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:15,302
Come with me.

152
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:18,179
Why?

153
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:21,850
So that you will believe...

154
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:24,519
...and be answered.

155
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:48,979
You win, my lord.

156
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:53,652
That is, the battle, not the war.

157
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:59,491
Oh, those waters
are far too shallow for galleys.

158
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:03,286
Hera, my dear, you really must learn
to win without cheating.

159
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:06,456
Or at least to lose gracefully.

160
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,636
- Greetings, Hermes.
- Greetings, my lord Zeus.

161
00:17:20,972 --> 00:17:22,723
There seems to be a piece missing.

162
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,058
Perhaps I can help.

163
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:36,486
Welcome to Olympus, Jason.

164
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:45,954
Jason come to Mount Olympus
at last.

165
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:49,833
No man calls upon the gods
unless he wants something.

166
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:53,337
We arranged for you
to be brought here by Hermes.

167
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,133
I wouldn't have believed a mortal
could ask the help of the gods...

168
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:00,344
...much less visit them.

169
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,222
Well, at least you're honest.

170
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,517
Which is more than I can say
for most other mortals.

171
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,020
What is it you want?

172
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,564
A ship? A crew?

173
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:14,776
No. Those I can find myself.

174
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:18,613
And what are you going to use
in place of gold?

175
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,364
The hearts of men.

176
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:24,535
I am Hera, queen of the gods
and your protector on this voyage.

177
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,789
But my lord Zeus has decreed a limit
to the number of times...

178
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:31,209
...I may help you when you call
upon me. Do not speak now.

179
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,877
I know what you must ask of me.

180
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,923
Does the Golden Fleece exist?
And if so, where is it?

181
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,549
That's two questions.

182
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,594
And I shall help him
with only one answer.

183
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:43,554
Search in the land of Colchis.

184
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,891
Then it does exist.

185
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,602
But Colchis...

186
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,980
That's the end of the world.
No Greek has ever sailed there.

187
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:54,691
Now that you've heard that...

188
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:58,237
...are you so sure
that you will not need my help?

189
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:00,906
Think carefully.

190
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,201
I offered him a ship.

191
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:07,120
A ship and a crew.

192
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:10,082
And he refused me.

193
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,417
Refused the help of the gods?

194
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,343
What ship is strong enough
to reach to the edge of the world?

195
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:24,263
What crew brave enough
to sail in her?

196
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:26,765
I shall tell
the shipbuilders of Greece...

197
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:29,726
...that the richest cargo in the world
waits in Colchis.

198
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:31,645
The Golden Fleece
is worth a kingdom.

199
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:35,941
I shall say that only the strongest ship
ever built will survive the voyage.

200
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:38,527
The athletes of Greece are proud.

201
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:40,946
I'll tell them only the best
can expect a place...

202
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,490
...in the most perilous voyage
in history.

203
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:44,950
I shall announce a games...

204
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,786
...invite the strongest
and bravest of the Greeks.

205
00:19:48,705 --> 00:19:50,956
No greater games
shall ever be held...

206
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,458
...unless the gods decree otherwise.

207
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,174
I did well to choose you, Jason.

208
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:05,138
The gods are best served
by those who want their help least.

209
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:11,978
Welcome, Polydeuces.

210
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,523
Castor of Sparta.

211
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:23,031
Acastus of Thessaly.

212
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:31,915
Well done, Acastus.

213
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:36,461
Phalerus of Athens,
champion archer of Greece.

214
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:39,130
Euphemus of Taenarum.

215
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:41,716
Spyros of Syracuse.

216
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:43,509
Hercules!

217
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,428
He's here!

218
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:01,528
I mean to sail with you, Jason. Tell me
which champion you want me to beat.

219
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,283
No one. I know you can beat us all.
Your place is reserved.

220
00:21:06,785 --> 00:21:09,870
Hercules. Yes.

221
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:14,917
- Hercules?
- Yes.

222
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:16,710
My name is Hylas.

223
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:20,089
Like you, I came too late
to compete in the games.

224
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,050
But it occurs to me that
if I can beat you at something...

225
00:21:23,218 --> 00:21:25,803
...Jason couldn't refuse me
a place on the ship either.

226
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:34,687
After all, he might need brains
as well as brawn.

227
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:38,440
Shall we compete?

228
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:44,488
Discus?

229
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,869
Come on.

230
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:59,087
- See that rock?
- Yes.

231
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:01,756
No thrower has ever reached it.

232
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:05,385
And is the contest to hit it
or pass it?

233
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:11,891
You'll be lucky if you get halfway.

234
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,144
- Now, go on.
- No, after you, Hercules.

235
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:17,188
I've never thrown a discus before.

236
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:20,316
I'd like to see how it's done.

237
00:22:58,148 --> 00:23:01,984
Let Hylas have his moment of triumph
while he may.

238
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,112
You shall have your place, Hylas.

239
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,198
Hail Hylas!

240
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:10,493
I have found the finest crew
in all Greece.

241
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,829
Now for a ship
that is worthy of them.

242
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:21,796
Argos.

243
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:25,883
- Argos.
- Hello?

244
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,927
Is that you, Argos?

245
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:31,347
- Who's there?
- It's Jason.

246
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:33,891
Come aboard.

247
00:23:54,871 --> 00:23:56,455
So you've come back again.

248
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:58,792
She's a fine ship.

249
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,710
Yes.

250
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:05,173
She is a fine ship.
She's ready to sail.

251
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:07,008
We've yet to give her a name.

252
00:24:07,552 --> 00:24:11,304
I'll call her the Argo,
after her builder.

253
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:14,724
The Argo?

254
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:18,728
Well, you'd better have a look
at the figurehead.

255
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:22,649
It might make you change your mind.
No, this way.

256
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:25,443
- Is it forward?
- No, it's astern.

257
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,903
We'll have to move it.

258
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:29,781
It's supposed to watch over
the water ahead of the vessel.

259
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:34,911
I can't help that.
Something made me put it here.

260
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:43,545
Hera, queen of the gods.

261
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:47,007
- What?
- Nothing.

262
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:49,050
You don't object to it here?

263
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:53,096
- No.
- Nor do I.

264
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:57,642
It makes me feel someone friendly
is watching over us.

265
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:02,648
- When do we sail?
- Tomorrow.

266
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:37,411
Don't waste it.

267
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:40,289
There isn't enough left
to make any difference, Jason.

268
00:26:40,456 --> 00:26:42,124
Oh, let him rest.

269
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:45,585
But the sooner we find some island
with water, the better.

270
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:48,297
We can't row much longer
on three sips a day.

271
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:51,258
Take my advice. Put back to Icos.

272
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:53,593
But we'd lose five days' sailing.

273
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:55,554
We haven't water enough
for tomorrow...

274
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:58,015
...let alone the time it would take
to reach Icos.

275
00:26:58,182 --> 00:27:01,936
Don't worry, Hylas.
I don't expect him to take my advice.

276
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:04,564
But I wish he'd listen to someone.

277
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,201
Still grumbling?

278
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:20,705
Sailors always grumble.

279
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,499
These sailors have something
to grumble about.

280
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,960
Hardly any water. Blistered hands.

281
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:28,463
- They should use brine.
- Brine?

282
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,506
It toughens the skin.

283
00:27:30,674 --> 00:27:33,593
Well, go down and treat them.
I'll steer.

284
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,270
Hera.

285
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,525
You said you could help me
a certain number of times.

286
00:27:49,943 --> 00:27:51,611
So far, you've told me of Colchis.

287
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:55,948
And I threw Pelias from his horse
and dragged him beneath the water.

288
00:27:56,116 --> 00:27:57,700
Pelias?

289
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:01,413
So that was King Pelias.

290
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:04,875
I know your need.
Set sail and steer north.

291
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:07,294
- You will reach land at noon.
- Where?

292
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:09,129
The Isle of Bronze.

293
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:11,507
I've never heard of it.

294
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:14,676
No mortal has.
It was the foundry of the gods.

295
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:18,430
Hephaestus labored there,
making armor and weapons for Zeus.

296
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:22,643
Oh, do not fear. Hephaestus himself
has long departed.

297
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:25,479
I will see that you reach
the Isle of Bronze.

298
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:28,816
But listen to me, Jason.
Listen very carefully.

299
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:42,287
- Take the helm.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:45,082
Set sail.

301
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,801
We reach land at noon.

302
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:59,388
Then you can fill your bellies until they
grumble as much as your tongues.

303
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:00,682
Now, mark this.

304
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:03,476
It will be safe to take
food and water.

305
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:08,022
But nothing else.
Absolutely nothing else.

306
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:10,733
That doesn't include women?

307
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:13,319
If there are any on the island,
yes, it does.

308
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,823
If I meet a girl with a firm leg,
a full bosom and a warm heart...

309
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:19,492
...let no man try and stop me.

310
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,287
- Talos will.
- Who's Talos?

311
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:24,998
You do mean there's a man there
who wants a fight?

312
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,499
I spoke of no man.

313
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:30,378
Food and water, Hercules.
That's all.

314
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:34,966
Jason, who told you of this island?

315
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:38,553
The goddess Hera.

316
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:10,336
Port helm.

317
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:13,631
Steady as you go.

318
00:30:14,174 --> 00:30:16,383
Furl the sail.

319
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:47,414
Ashore for food and water.

320
00:30:59,219 --> 00:31:02,722
- Are goats good sailors?
- Goats? What are you talking about?

321
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,058
What do you want with goats
onboard ship?

322
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:07,978
Well, some of us might be hungry...

323
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:10,188
...or thirsty.

324
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:12,732
Come on.

325
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,201
Here's one for the pot.

326
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:33,086
Hercules.

327
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:55,650
Isn't he one of the Titans?

328
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:58,528
He might be. He's big enough.

329
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:06,203
Didn't Jason say something
about Talos?

330
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:19,800
This must be where Hephaestus
molded the statues of the gods.

331
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:24,722
Yes. And set them up
for all the world to see.

332
00:32:43,116 --> 00:32:44,992
Hercules.

333
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:25,158
It's a treasure chamber.

334
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:28,704
The treasure chamber of the gods.

335
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:34,793
Look at this.

336
00:33:34,961 --> 00:33:37,003
And this.

337
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:38,797
A pearl.

338
00:33:38,965 --> 00:33:40,298
It's a javelin.

339
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:43,301
Don't be silly. In a jewel box?

340
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:45,721
It's a brooch pin.

341
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,807
Well, whatever it is,
it'll make a useful weapon.

342
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:50,434
Let's get back to the ship.

343
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:53,812
- Hercules.
- Well, what is it?

344
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,231
- You'd better put it back.
- Why?

345
00:33:56,941 --> 00:34:00,819
- Remember what Jason said?
- It won't be missed.

346
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:05,158
Anyway, if the gods leave all this
lying about unguarded...

347
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:08,119
...they obviously don't want it.
Come on.

348
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,544
It must have been the wind.

349
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,889
And you saw nothing of them
after that?

350
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,017
Perhaps Hercules found a woman
after all.

351
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,112
Talos.

352
00:37:59,229 --> 00:38:02,731
- Back water.
- Back. Back water.

353
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:04,358
Back.

354
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:43,334
I warned you, Jason.
This is Hercules' doing.

355
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:46,504
Talos will try to kill all of you.

356
00:39:46,671 --> 00:39:47,713
How can I fight him?

357
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:50,800
Think before you waste
the gift of the gods.

358
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:53,594
Against a man of bronze,
our weapons are useless.

359
00:39:53,762 --> 00:39:55,262
I repeat that question.

360
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,014
Then I must answer it.

361
00:39:57,182 --> 00:40:01,018
Fight Talos with your wits
rather than your courage.

362
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:03,395
And look to his ankles.

363
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:04,772
His ankles?

364
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:08,360
There is nothing else I can tell you.

365
00:40:56,242 --> 00:40:57,784
Jason.

366
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,870
You disobeyed my order.

367
00:41:13,927 --> 00:41:16,596
Lure him to these rocks,
but stay out of reach.

368
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:19,056
- And what will you do?
- I shall hide here, Acastus.

369
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,560
I shall do my very best
to send him to you, Jason.

370
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:24,061
My very best.

371
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,266
Mind his foot!

372
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,671
Quick, get back to the rocks.

373
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,430
Hylas.

374
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,520
Hercules, you've left your...

375
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:08,016
- Well?
- We searched, Argos.

376
00:46:08,184 --> 00:46:10,268
And I will search again.

377
00:46:10,436 --> 00:46:14,106
Hylas was with us.
We saw him running.

378
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:17,067
But then he disappeared.

379
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:20,529
He could've been hurt,
not able to get back to the ship.

380
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:24,158
Like Palinuros.
We had to carry him aboard.

381
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:28,037
Hercules, Hylas is dead.

382
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,541
The gods decided it.

383
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:37,213
Why kill a boy for my grave fault?

384
00:46:39,257 --> 00:46:41,592
But I should have stayed with him.

385
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,513
Search until nightfall.
We won't sail till then.

386
00:46:54,022 --> 00:46:56,232
Sail when you please, Jason.

387
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:59,777
I cannot leave this island
till I've found Hylas.

388
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:20,632
Jason.

389
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,553
Will you abandon Hercules,
the best man among us?

390
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,181
- I, for one, won't sail without him.
- Nor shall I.

391
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:30,600
Nor I.

392
00:47:31,978 --> 00:47:32,978
Come with me.

393
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:36,314
Hylas!

394
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,452
Is there any man here
who does not obey the gods?

395
00:47:51,664 --> 00:47:56,626
We will do as the goddess Hera
commands, if she will speak to us.

396
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,341
This is your last chance, Jason.

397
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:12,517
The last time that I can help you.

398
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:14,145
I understand.

399
00:48:15,105 --> 00:48:16,939
Then know this, Argonauts.

400
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:19,483
- Hylas is dead.
- Hylas is dead.

401
00:48:19,651 --> 00:48:23,362
As for Hercules, he is not fated
to go further with the Argo.

402
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,531
Zeus has other tasks for him.

403
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:28,075
And for us, Hera?

404
00:48:28,243 --> 00:48:32,371
Sail to Phrygia.
Seek out Phineas, the blinded man.

405
00:48:32,539 --> 00:48:34,832
Only he can guide you now.

406
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:40,046
We set sail.

407
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:47,219
Come on, back to your places.

408
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:53,893
Back to your places.
Get forward there.

409
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,908
Go away!

410
00:50:33,454 --> 00:51:14,035
Devils! Demons!

411
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:47,611
Lord Zeus, I was a sinner.

412
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:50,989
I've never tried to deny it.

413
00:51:51,157 --> 00:51:54,576
But I didn't sin every day.

414
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:58,914
Why, then,
do you punish me every day?

415
00:52:17,977 --> 00:52:20,478
What in the name of the gods
are they?

416
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:39,539
Jason.

417
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,675
- Are you Phineas?
- Yes.

418
00:52:50,843 --> 00:52:53,011
Take my arm. I can't see yours.

419
00:52:53,178 --> 00:52:54,971
Don't flinch.

420
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:01,978
Zeus gave me the gift of prophecy,
but I misused it...

421
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,272
...so I was blinded.

422
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,817
Zeus ordered the Harpies
to torment me.

423
00:53:08,402 --> 00:53:12,155
You, Jason, now listen to me.

424
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:16,701
The gods have ordered me to tell you
whatever you want to know.

425
00:53:17,245 --> 00:53:19,997
But the gods have gone
too far with me.

426
00:53:20,165 --> 00:53:25,002
They can punish a man so much,
and then one day he abandons them.

427
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,921
He says, "All right, Zeus.

428
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:30,841
Throw a thunderbolt.
Let the earth swallow me.

429
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:32,092
I defy you."

430
00:53:35,764 --> 00:53:38,766
You growl away all you like, Zeus.

431
00:53:38,934 --> 00:53:42,186
I mean what I say. Jason.

432
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:44,730
I'll tell you
what you want to know...

433
00:53:44,898 --> 00:53:47,399
...only if you'll meet my price.

434
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:49,318
What is your price then?

435
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:51,904
Free me from these
tormenting Harpies.

436
00:53:52,072 --> 00:53:54,239
If Zeus sent those creatures
to plague him...

437
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:56,283
...we'd be unwise to interfere.

438
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:58,619
That's my price.

439
00:53:58,787 --> 00:54:00,871
Then we'll meet it, Phineas.

440
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,749
We'll make you
the master of the Harpies.

441
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:31,858
Get to the ropes!

442
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:42,828
Now.

443
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,305
Castor. Phalerus.

444
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:04,391
Find some wood to build a cage.

445
00:57:14,152 --> 00:57:15,986
Here you are, you hungry fellow.

446
00:57:16,154 --> 00:57:19,156
A big fish for you
and some more wine.

447
00:57:22,286 --> 00:57:25,872
Well, Phineas, we've completed
our part of the bargain.

448
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:28,583
- What is it you want to know?
- The way to Colchis.

449
00:57:29,293 --> 00:57:32,128
The way to Colchis
is through the Clashing Rocks.

450
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:34,964
Steer northwest
and you'll reach them in five days.

451
00:57:35,132 --> 00:57:36,174
Northwest, eh?

452
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:39,302
After the Clashing Rocks,
you turn northeast.

453
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:42,305
Before long, you'll sight
the shores of Colchis.

454
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:44,932
But tell me, what gods protect you?

455
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:47,351
None now.

456
00:57:48,228 --> 00:57:50,605
Then you won't pass
the Clashing Rocks.

457
00:57:50,772 --> 00:57:54,775
- What are the Clashing Rocks?
- They speak for themselves, don't they?

458
00:57:56,028 --> 00:57:58,571
All I can offer you is this.

459
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,574
It's not much reward
for what you've done...

460
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:03,951
...but it's all I have.

461
00:58:07,873 --> 00:58:11,167
If that's all you can tell us,
then goodbye.

462
00:58:12,294 --> 00:58:14,462
The gods be merciful to you.

463
00:58:25,308 --> 00:58:28,727
Phineas, from now on, they'll witness
a banquet every night...

464
00:58:28,895 --> 00:58:31,313
...and eat the scraps you leave.

465
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:36,777
Good appetite.

466
00:59:13,231 --> 00:59:15,565
There's not much water here.

467
00:59:42,553 --> 00:59:45,930
Steady as you go. Row easy.

468
00:59:53,897 --> 00:59:55,398
Easy, all.

469
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:57,608
Easy, all!

470
01:00:30,143 --> 01:00:31,769
It's a narrow channel...

471
01:00:31,936 --> 01:00:34,396
...but I can't see what
made Phineas so frightened.

472
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,440
It looks calm enough.

473
01:00:36,775 --> 01:00:38,442
Too calm.

474
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,694
Acastus!

475
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,243
I know the sea god's moods.

476
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,789
But most of them are dangerous.

477
01:00:51,956 --> 01:00:54,625
Acastus, take a sounding.

478
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,462
The rest of you, be prepared to row
when I give the word.

479
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:02,424
But an easy stroke.
Save your strength.

480
01:01:04,386 --> 01:01:06,512
They may need it later.

481
01:01:10,016 --> 01:01:15,896
Ship ahoy!

482
01:01:16,815 --> 01:01:19,024
There she is.

483
01:01:20,068 --> 01:01:22,236
She doesn't seem to be
in any great difficulty.

484
01:03:21,274 --> 01:03:23,150
A whole ship's crew.

485
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:24,778
And Lynceus from the masthead.

486
01:03:25,196 --> 01:03:28,740
There was no hope of saving him,
not in that sea.

487
01:03:29,325 --> 01:03:31,284
Are we going through?

488
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:36,206
- Yes.
- But it's...

489
01:03:36,749 --> 01:03:39,876
All right, we're going through.

490
01:03:40,044 --> 01:03:42,170
Back to your places.

491
01:03:47,343 --> 01:03:49,469
There's no turning back now.

492
01:03:49,637 --> 01:03:51,179
No, Acastus.

493
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:53,348
There's no turning back
on this voyage.

494
01:03:53,516 --> 01:03:56,351
Drummer, beat out the stroke...

495
01:03:57,144 --> 01:03:59,521
...but keep it easy.

496
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:03,817
The gods want their entertainment.

497
01:04:05,361 --> 01:04:06,778
Jason goes too far.

498
01:04:06,946 --> 01:04:11,199
Because he speaks the truth
when the gods themselves go too far?

499
01:04:58,248 --> 01:05:01,292
Turn back, Jason. We're trapped.

500
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:05,463
- Trapped, Hera.
- It seems so.

501
01:05:06,548 --> 01:05:09,383
You've left me only one move.

502
01:05:18,393 --> 01:05:20,353
Pray to the gods, Jason.

503
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,313
The gods of Greece are cruel.

504
01:05:24,566 --> 01:05:27,903
In time, all men
shall learn to do without them.

505
01:06:36,014 --> 01:06:39,183
Pull! Pull!

506
01:06:40,018 --> 01:06:42,186
Get back to your place.

507
01:06:59,371 --> 01:07:00,580
Pull!

508
01:07:00,748 --> 01:07:05,251
Pull till your hides crack
and your backs break.

509
01:07:05,419 --> 01:07:09,964
Pull!

510
01:07:50,423 --> 01:07:52,966
Keep the stroke going.

511
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:17,324
Jason dared to speak
of the end of the gods...

512
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:19,243
...and yet you let him live.

513
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:24,665
If I were to punish every blasphemy,
I'd soon lose all loyalty and respect.

514
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:26,917
You are the god of many men.

515
01:08:27,086 --> 01:08:29,254
Yet when those men
no longer believe in you...

516
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:31,047
...then you'll return to nothing.

517
01:08:31,215 --> 01:08:35,552
You understand that,
and yet you remain with me.

518
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:38,179
You think it weak of me, my lord?

519
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,431
Not weak.

520
01:08:40,599 --> 01:08:42,767
Almost human.

521
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:01,786
Whichever god or goddess
helped us...

522
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:03,580
...is to be thanked.

523
01:09:03,747 --> 01:09:05,832
Those others weren't so fortunate.

524
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,167
What's that?

525
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:51,170
Who are you?

526
01:09:51,338 --> 01:09:52,838
Your ship was lost.

527
01:09:53,006 --> 01:09:55,966
We found only two other survivors.
They're being looked after.

528
01:09:56,134 --> 01:09:58,385
Here. Drink this.

529
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:03,390
When did you sail from Colchis?

530
01:10:03,558 --> 01:10:05,601
Dawn, this morning.

531
01:10:05,769 --> 01:10:07,436
Dawn?

532
01:10:08,355 --> 01:10:10,564
Then our journey is nearly over.

533
01:10:10,732 --> 01:10:13,275
- Where have you come from?
- Thessaly.

534
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:15,611
But that's the other side
of the world.

535
01:10:16,905 --> 01:10:19,365
You don't look like a merchant.

536
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:23,035
Your vessel's a fighting ship.

537
01:10:23,203 --> 01:10:25,204
We'd be foolish to sail unarmed.

538
01:10:26,331 --> 01:10:30,168
By all accounts, your king, Aeetes,
fears the gods...

539
01:10:30,336 --> 01:10:32,879
...and we were sent by the gods.

540
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:35,674
But I'm gonna talk to him alone,
peacefully.

541
01:10:36,092 --> 01:10:37,634
Now you answer a question.

542
01:10:37,802 --> 01:10:40,178
What was your ship doing
in such dangerous waters?

543
01:10:40,346 --> 01:10:43,556
We came to sacrifice
to the gods of the rocks...

544
01:10:43,724 --> 01:10:46,768
...to throw flowers onto the sea
to make it safe for our ships.

545
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,564
I'm afraid our gods were angry,
not so powerful as yours.

546
01:10:51,732 --> 01:10:52,983
Are you a priestess?

547
01:10:54,318 --> 01:10:56,319
I serve in the temple of Hecate.

548
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:58,571
A dancer.

549
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:00,949
Is Hecate the god of the Colchians?

550
01:11:01,117 --> 01:11:02,242
The goddess.

551
01:11:02,410 --> 01:11:05,078
But I'd heard they worship
some strange idol...

552
01:11:05,246 --> 01:11:06,871
...the skull and skin of a ram.

553
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:08,415
No ordinary ram.

554
01:11:08,582 --> 01:11:12,127
Its fleece is of gold.
A gift of the gods themselves...

555
01:11:12,294 --> 01:11:15,547
...and it's brought our city
great peace and prosperity.

556
01:11:15,715 --> 01:11:18,425
We'll put you ashore
at dawn tomorrow.

557
01:11:18,592 --> 01:11:21,469
Perhaps you will show me
the way to the city.

558
01:11:21,637 --> 01:11:24,472
Now, tell me your name.

559
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,391
Medea.

560
01:11:26,559 --> 01:11:28,810
And you can answer
my first question.

561
01:11:29,604 --> 01:11:31,647
- Who are you?
- My name is Jason.

562
01:11:41,616 --> 01:11:44,452
Within a few hours,
we shall sight Colchis.

563
01:11:44,619 --> 01:11:46,829
I'm coming in quietly by night.

564
01:11:46,997 --> 01:11:49,749
Now the voyage is over,
I don't want the trouble to begin.

565
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:51,834
Won't be any trouble, Jason.

566
01:11:52,002 --> 01:11:54,587
Just tell us where the city is
and when we attack.

567
01:11:55,005 --> 01:11:56,422
We don't attack.

568
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:00,134
But that's foolish. You have
the finest fighting men in the world.

569
01:12:00,302 --> 01:12:02,094
Forty fighting men against a nation?

570
01:12:02,262 --> 01:12:04,013
Better 40 than one, Jason.

571
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:05,723
We're not pirates, Phalerus.

572
01:12:05,891 --> 01:12:09,018
What's that girl done to you?
We thought you were a fighting man.

573
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,938
I'm going up alone in the morning
to see what the situation is.

574
01:12:13,106 --> 01:12:17,151
Oh, you mean spy out the land.
Well, why alone?

575
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:19,070
Why not take a few of us scouting?

576
01:12:19,237 --> 01:12:22,323
The fewer who go,
the less can get caught.

577
01:12:22,491 --> 01:12:25,117
- What's the fewest you can think of?
- One, of course.

578
01:12:25,285 --> 01:12:27,119
Right. I accept your advice.

579
01:12:27,287 --> 01:12:28,829
But I don't.

580
01:12:28,997 --> 01:12:32,000
Having sailed this far together,
we're free to speak our minds.

581
01:12:32,168 --> 01:12:34,127
And what's on yours, Acastus?

582
01:12:34,295 --> 01:12:37,214
We nose our way upstream,
rush the guards and seize the fleece.

583
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:40,467
We'd be out into the open sea
while Aeetes is still asleep.

584
01:12:40,635 --> 01:12:42,427
- A night attack?
- Yes.

585
01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:45,847
And in the dark, during the attack,
a man will die.

586
01:12:46,015 --> 01:12:47,099
That man will be me.

587
01:12:47,642 --> 01:12:48,975
A javelin in my back.

588
01:12:49,143 --> 01:12:52,020
A Greek javelin, Acastus.
Maybe your javelin.

589
01:12:52,188 --> 01:12:54,773
- You'll die for that, Jason.
- Keep back.

590
01:14:10,726 --> 01:14:13,019
Euphemus.

591
01:14:34,584 --> 01:14:37,628
It's Euphemus. He's dead.

592
01:14:41,466 --> 01:14:45,219
Look at this. Slashed and bloody.

593
01:14:46,471 --> 01:14:48,805
Acastus must be
at the bottom of the sea.

594
01:14:48,973 --> 01:14:50,515
I wonder.

595
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,435
- Make sail.
- And Euphemus?

596
01:14:53,603 --> 01:14:56,355
The sea was his kingdom
while he was alive.

597
01:14:56,522 --> 01:14:58,273
Let it take his body now he's dead.

598
01:14:58,441 --> 01:15:00,484
Make sail.

599
01:15:00,944 --> 01:15:03,028
Make sail!

600
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:10,327
You're wounded.

601
01:15:11,371 --> 01:15:15,165
We have a flower in Colchis
which heals and soothes.

602
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:17,292
Tomorrow, I'll show you.

603
01:15:27,345 --> 01:15:28,762
What do you call the flower?

604
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,682
It has no name.
It grows on a double stalk.

605
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:34,519
They say it sprang
from the blood of Prometheus.

606
01:15:34,687 --> 01:15:39,440
And it has been used over the years
for its soothing and curing powers.

607
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,529
The sun's getting higher.
We must be on our way.

608
01:15:44,697 --> 01:15:46,364
Follow the road to the east.

609
01:15:46,532 --> 01:15:48,199
You're not coming further?

610
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:50,535
I go another way.

611
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:40,166
The goddess Hecate has spoken.

612
01:18:41,501 --> 01:18:44,378
There will be one among us today...

613
01:18:44,546 --> 01:18:47,715
...from the ends of the world.

614
01:18:48,383 --> 01:18:50,801
His name is Jason.

615
01:18:50,969 --> 01:18:54,472
Any man of whom he asks his way...

616
01:18:54,639 --> 01:18:55,806
...shall say this:

617
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:59,393
"Aeetes, king of Colchis...

618
01:18:59,561 --> 01:19:02,563
...awaits him
in the temple of Hecate."

619
01:19:03,899 --> 01:19:07,610
And that is all
any man shall say to him.

620
01:19:13,074 --> 01:19:14,283
Come forward, Jason.

621
01:19:30,425 --> 01:19:33,219
You have done all of us
a great service.

622
01:19:33,386 --> 01:19:35,013
Tonight, we shall feast you.

623
01:19:35,681 --> 01:19:39,184
We know of your great heroism,
and it deserves celebration.

624
01:19:39,352 --> 01:19:42,354
Return, then, to your companions
and bring them to my palace.

625
01:19:42,522 --> 01:19:44,523
I thank you, my lord...

626
01:19:44,982 --> 01:19:47,359
...but I do not understand.

627
01:19:51,072 --> 01:19:54,282
- Medea?
- Welcome to Colchis.

628
01:20:15,846 --> 01:20:20,100
I give you Jason and the Argonauts.

629
01:20:20,268 --> 01:20:23,144
Jason and the Argonauts!

630
01:20:28,317 --> 01:20:31,403
Tell me, Jason,
why did you come to Colchis?

631
01:20:32,029 --> 01:20:33,947
In peace.

632
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:36,993
I said "why," not "how."

633
01:20:37,578 --> 01:20:39,954
Altogether,
how many men have you?

634
01:20:40,122 --> 01:20:41,581
Enough.

635
01:20:41,748 --> 01:20:44,166
And you say you do not
threaten us?

636
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:47,336
Envoys who come to me in deceit
remain in death.

637
01:20:48,714 --> 01:20:51,132
I know you've come for the fleece.

638
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,760
I know, too, that if you cannot win it
by bargaining, you plan to steal it.

639
01:20:55,429 --> 01:20:57,513
But we'll never part with it, Jason.

640
01:20:57,681 --> 01:21:00,182
It is a gift of the gods.

641
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,643
It has brought wealth and peace
to Colchis.

642
01:21:02,811 --> 01:21:05,646
Should we ever let it go,
it would mean plague and famine...

643
01:21:05,814 --> 01:21:07,523
...and the destruction
of our country!

644
01:21:08,025 --> 01:21:10,526
We can no longer welcome
or entertain you...

645
01:21:10,694 --> 01:21:12,528
...but treat you as you deserve.

646
01:21:12,696 --> 01:21:14,655
As thieves...

647
01:21:14,823 --> 01:21:16,991
...as pirates...

648
01:21:17,576 --> 01:21:20,411
...as murderers.

649
01:21:26,043 --> 01:21:29,211
We give our thanks to one person.

650
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:34,800
The person who exposed
a criminal attempt on our kingdom:

651
01:21:35,928 --> 01:21:39,723
The son of King Pelias
of Thessaly...

652
01:21:39,891 --> 01:21:42,017
...Acastus.

653
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:46,229
Hail!

654
01:22:12,882 --> 01:22:15,926
Hecate, queen of darkness...

655
01:22:16,094 --> 01:22:17,969
...you've always helped me.

656
01:22:18,137 --> 01:22:20,555
Tell me now what I must do.

657
01:22:21,265 --> 01:22:25,268
You, who gave me
the gift of foresight...

658
01:22:25,436 --> 01:22:28,939
...why didn't you reveal to me
Acastus' treachery?

659
01:22:29,774 --> 01:22:32,943
He who sits drinking with Aeetes...

660
01:22:33,111 --> 01:22:35,237
...while Jason...

661
01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:39,784
...imprisoned, condemned to death.

662
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:44,038
If I help him now
in the quest for the fleece...

663
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:48,626
...I shall be a traitor to my country...

664
01:22:49,294 --> 01:22:52,255
...and to you, Hecate.

665
01:22:55,426 --> 01:22:57,385
And if not...

666
01:22:59,638 --> 01:23:01,597
...to myself.

667
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:07,979
Help me, Hecate.

668
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,350
Medea.

669
01:23:45,518 --> 01:23:48,520
Why did you come here?
Was it Aeetes who sent you?

670
01:23:48,688 --> 01:23:50,814
I came to ask you
to give up your quest...

671
01:23:50,982 --> 01:23:53,817
...and sail away
with the Argonauts in peace.

672
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:55,736
Never return.

673
01:23:55,904 --> 01:23:57,654
Never to think
of the Golden Fleece?

674
01:23:57,822 --> 01:23:59,364
Never to think of the fleece.

675
01:23:59,532 --> 01:24:01,158
Then it was Aeetes.

676
01:24:01,785 --> 01:24:04,703
You tell him I will fulfill the task
the gods have sent me...

677
01:24:04,871 --> 01:24:08,749
...and never betray the Argonauts,
whatever he offers me.

678
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,544
Even if it's Medea,
high priestess of Hecate.

679
01:24:12,712 --> 01:24:13,796
Please...

680
01:24:14,839 --> 01:24:19,718
...forget the Golden Fleece.
I fear for your safety.

681
01:24:21,721 --> 01:24:24,890
If you're set on carrying it away...

682
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,559
...I must come with you.

683
01:24:28,895 --> 01:24:30,145
I'll go alone.

684
01:24:31,397 --> 01:24:32,898
No.

685
01:24:33,566 --> 01:24:36,777
I have to go with you.
I have no country now.

686
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,740
And I love you.

687
01:24:57,716 --> 01:25:00,802
Castor, Phalerus, Dmitrius,
get to the door.

688
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:03,429
The rest of you,
back to your places.

689
01:25:08,435 --> 01:25:10,937
- The priestess.
- Argos, listen to Medea.

690
01:25:11,105 --> 01:25:14,148
When you're clear of the palace,
go to the ship and row downstream.

691
01:25:14,316 --> 01:25:17,026
There's a break in the cliff
and a path through the woods.

692
01:25:17,194 --> 01:25:19,737
Anchor there. We'll join you.

693
01:25:37,798 --> 01:25:39,341
Well, what is it?

694
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:42,344
- Jason has escaped.
- And his men?

695
01:25:42,512 --> 01:25:45,973
They were all gone. I was making
my rounds, found the guards drugged.

696
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:49,351
Drugged?
Then there's an accomplice.

697
01:25:49,519 --> 01:25:52,313
- Where's Acastus?
- He's not in his quarters.

698
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,357
Acastus help Jason?

699
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:58,152
But there's no reason to it.

700
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:01,989
Unless it was Medea
who mixed the drug.

701
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,991
The high priestess of Hecate?

702
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,161
I saw how Medea looked at Jason.

703
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:12,666
If Medea's helping them, then she's
guiding them to the Golden Fleece...

704
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,336
...and the Argonauts will take ship.

705
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,212
The landward way is shorter.

706
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:20,007
Muster your men, captain.

707
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:57,212
Listen.

708
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:01,216
Soldiers.

709
01:27:01,968 --> 01:27:04,386
Phalerus, Castor,
you come with me.

710
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,346
- No, not you, Polydeuces.
- But, Argos...

711
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:09,557
You stay aboard with the rest
of the men and guard the ship.

712
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:10,594
Jason.

713
01:31:14,098 --> 01:31:15,807
Aeetes and the Colchians.

714
01:31:16,434 --> 01:31:19,436
We heard them from the ship.
They must be somewhere near.

715
01:31:22,315 --> 01:31:24,024
Get the fleece.

716
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:24,210
Guards, follow them up there
and that way.

717
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:29,007
Wait.

718
01:32:40,728 --> 01:32:42,812
Hecate, queen of darkness...

719
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,941
...revenge yourself
against the Thessalians.

720
01:32:46,109 --> 01:32:49,403
Deliver to me the children
of the Hydra's teeth...

721
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:51,572
...the children of the night.

722
01:33:37,702 --> 01:33:41,663
The teeth.
Fetch me the Hydra's teeth, quickly.

723
01:34:07,316 --> 01:34:09,984
Against the children
of the Hydra's teeth...

724
01:34:10,152 --> 01:34:12,946
...there is no protection.

725
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:08,377
The fleece. Give me the fleece.

726
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,089
It has the power to heal.

727
01:35:41,411 --> 01:35:44,246
It's true.
It does have the power to heal.

728
01:36:06,938 --> 01:36:09,022
Jason!

729
01:36:10,233 --> 01:36:13,860
Hold the guards back, captain,
or they may die...

730
01:36:14,028 --> 01:36:15,904
...killed with Jason and his pirates.

731
01:36:39,136 --> 01:36:42,472
Rise up, you dead,
slain of the Hydra.

732
01:36:43,599 --> 01:36:47,186
Rise from your graves
and avenge us.

733
01:36:47,354 --> 01:36:52,149
Those who steal the Golden Fleece
must die.

734
01:37:26,351 --> 01:37:28,144
Argos, get down to the ship.

735
01:37:28,312 --> 01:37:30,771
- Take Medea.
- Come with me.

736
01:37:48,541 --> 01:37:50,042
There.

737
01:37:57,216 --> 01:37:58,759
And there.

738
01:38:04,057 --> 01:38:05,807
And still another.

739
01:38:07,894 --> 01:38:09,561
Wait.

740
01:38:13,733 --> 01:38:15,359
And more.

741
01:38:40,259 --> 01:38:42,761
Destroy them!

742
01:38:45,056 --> 01:38:47,265
Kill!

743
01:38:47,893 --> 01:38:51,396
Kill, kill, kill them all!

744
01:39:56,421 --> 01:39:58,172
Get back.

745
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:45,591
I think that proves at last
that I'm a worthy opponent, my lord.

746
01:42:45,759 --> 01:42:46,926
Where are you going?

747
01:42:47,093 --> 01:42:50,847
- To clear the board. The game is over.
- It certainly is not.

748
01:43:01,567 --> 01:43:04,861
For the moment
let them enjoy a calm sea...

749
01:43:05,029 --> 01:43:07,614
...a fresh breeze and each other.

750
01:43:07,782 --> 01:43:11,284
The girl is pretty,
and I was always sentimental.

751
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:16,790
But for Jason
there are other adventures.

752
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:18,917
I have not yet finished with Jason.

753
01:43:20,544 --> 01:43:24,381
Let us continue the game
another day.
