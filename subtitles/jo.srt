2
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,639
You have to pull the trigger.

3
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,344
You have to pull the trigger.

4
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,450
Let's start again.

5
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:57,525
You there.

6
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,441
Are you ready?
- Yes.

7
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:22,636
Mathilde, it's me.
It's me.

8
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,187
It's Mr Colas, the barrister.
Recognise him?

9
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:27,934
Give me a hand.

10
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:36,284
We were rehearsing.
The gun's not real. Look.

11
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:06,514
What are you doing?

12
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:19,333
Grab her there.
Yes, like that.

13
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:39,053
Why didn't you warn me?
- It's not a joke. It's work.

14
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:41,804
So it wasn't real?
- Of course not.

15
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,612
I almost died from the shock.

16
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:49,178
Your reaction proves
that it's a good scene.

17
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:52,083
I'm happy.
- Me too.

18
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,958
How do you feel?
How do you feel?

19
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,608
I want to go back to the kitchen.
- She's stuck.

20
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:05,247
When you'll have another corpse,
please let me know.

21
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:07,403
Alright.
What do you think about my debut?

22
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:11,566
Old chap, I don't think
it's very good.

23
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:16,667
If you ask my opinion as a barrister,
I'll give it as a friend.

24
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:22,995
You're a good comedy author,
but for a detective story...

25
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:27,295
What's wrong with the story?
- Well, first of all...

26
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:31,071
Why does your hero shoot the man?
- Because he's a bastard.

27
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:35,321
If you want to shoot all the bastards...
- He's a bastard who blackmails my hero.

28
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:40,759
He had to pay for the first time,
then for the second time...

29
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,946
...and now he has to...
- I don't understand what you're saying.

30
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,708
What?
- He...

31
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,237
Double.
- Ah!

32
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:55,885
And my hero can't pay that, so he
has to sell this, that, this...

33
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:59,713
...this, that, only the
chandelier stays.

34
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:03,098
You get all worked up in order
to write a detective story.

35
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:07,611
He pretends he'll pay.
- Yes.

36
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:10,581
Good, and... and...

37
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:13,684
Yes.
- Let's go there.

38
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:17,441
The villain comes from there, like you.
- Yes.

39
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:20,385
He stands here.
- Bang, bang, dead.

40
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:22,676
What bang, bang, dead?
- Bang, bang, dead.

41
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:26,083
Bang, bang, you kill him.

42
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:31,643
I don't like that your hero's
holding something back.

43
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:37,320
He just happened to end up in this
story and he's completely innocent.

44
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:41,435
Why doesn't he go to the police?
- Because he can't.

45
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:44,581
And the audience won't know why?
- I don't want them to know.

46
00:06:44,582 --> 00:06:49,632
Alright, call me after you've
worked on the story. See you later.

47
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:55,148
What's wrong with my story?
- Your hero will end on the scaffold.

48
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:58,283
He can't say.
- Will he commit the perfect murder?

49
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,745
In a way, yes.
- Have you got a bucket of water?

50
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:05,085
A bucket of water?
- To get the blood of your carpet.

51
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,685
Avoid blood on carpet.
- That's it.

52
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:22,237
And also avoid yelling by the maid.
- Ah yes, the maid.

53
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:26,631
Maid... avoid... yelling.
- See you later.

54
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:30,858
Yes, yes.

55
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:33,213
There's also a way to
commit a perfect murder.

56
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:36,815
Yes?
- That's to make the body disappear.

57
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:40,774
When there's no body, they can't
prove there was a murder.

58
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:44,447
Yes, that's true.
Thanks.

59
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:48,564
Hey, wait.
Wait, wait.

60
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:55,550
What if I throw the body in the water?
- It'll float back up.

61
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:59,260
I didn't think of that.
- Unless you cut the body to pieces.

62
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:03,058
From the bottom up.
- And in an oven.

63
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:05,590
Does he have fake teeth?
- I don't know.

64
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:09,847
Teeth don't burn easily.
- That sounds really difficult.

65
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:13,897
Alright, bye bye.
- Mr Brisebard!

66
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:17,262
Mr Brisebard.
- Good morning.

67
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,670
Did you convince your wife
to sell the property?

68
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:24,560
It's not easy. Have you got someone?
- Yes, Mr Grunder.

69
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:29,658
He's rich and they're looking
for a nice property...

70
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:34,536
...that's quiet and rural.
Can we come and visit?

71
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:40,902
My wife can't know. Come over in the
evening when she's at the theatre.

72
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:45,854
Excuse me.
- Another one that's henpecked.

73
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,681
Hello?
- Mr Brisebard?

74
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:59,392
You forgot about me.
- No, I think about you all the time.

75
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:03,809
Have you taken a decision?
- Yes, I can't do this.

76
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,679
I can't at the moment.
- Why not?

77
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,728
I can't tell you why not.
- I'm giving you 48 hours.

78
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:17,417
You're very kind.
I'll call you back. Bye.

79
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:50,376
What is this?
- Delivery of Mrs Brisebard's gazebo.

80
00:09:55,903 --> 00:10:00,525
Happy birthday, darling.
- What's this, Mrs Brisebard's gazebo?

81
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:03,679
I wanted to surprise you for the feast
of St. Anthony. You're not very happy...

82
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,195
But I am.
- Leave me alone, you...

83
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:08,591
It's a beautiful gift.
- It certainly is.

84
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:11,958
Leave me in peace.
- You'll never guess where I found it.

85
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,063
In the Puy-de-Dôme.
- The Puy-de-Dôme.

86
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,030
Yes, the Puy-de-Dôme.
- Get lost!

87
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:22,208
I can never afford this.
- But it's a good investment.

88
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,756
And all the little details
go very well with the house.

89
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:29,693
And what does it cost?
- I got it at a bargain price.

90
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,666
250,000 francs.
- What?

91
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,320
Without the foundation.
- What?

92
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,956
I have to go to the theatre.
Have a nice day, darling.

93
00:10:41,294 --> 00:10:46,577
Why am I the only man in the world
whose wife bought a gazebo?

94
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:51,946
Mrs Brisebard and I agreed on 250,000
for the foundation.

95
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:55,276
250,000 francs?
- But for you, I'll do it for 248,000.

96
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:59,929
That's quite a favour.
- And don't worry about the payments.

97
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,587
My men and I will make a big hole
in the ground, for the foundation.

98
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:08,668
And tomorrow, I'll pour in cement
and then I'll place the gazebo on top.

99
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:13,237
I guarantee you that the foundation
will last at least 200 years.

100
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:15,752
I won't be able to check that
in 200 years.

101
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:19,511
200 years?
- Yes, indeed.

102
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:24,272
Can you guarantee that the
hole will be made tonight?

103
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:26,683
Tonight in 200 years.
- What, in 200 years?

104
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:29,286
Tonight, for 200 years.
- Tonight...

105
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:31,444
The hole will be there!

106
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,999
Can I count on you?
- You can.

107
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,257
Promise?
- Promise.

108
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:39,511
Start right away.
- Right away.

109
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,225
It's a deal.

110
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:45,877
Come on, we start.

111
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,360
Mr Jo?
- Yes?

112
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:51,049
Antoine Brisebard speaking.
- Well?

113
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,289
It's solved.
- Ah!

114
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,476
First I couldn't do it, but now I can.
- How much?

115
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:59,692
I'll have exactly what you need.

116
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:01,833
Like last time.
- 9 o'clock at your place.

117
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:07,038
9 o'clock and I'll leave the door open.
See you tonight, Mr Jo.

118
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:14,250
Sylvie?
- Yes.

119
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:18,839
It's all been solved with Mr Tonelotti.
After tomorrow, everything'll be ready.

120
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,299
We can save money by not
having any foundations.

121
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,699
But we need foundations.
Big foundations!

122
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,061
Look.

123
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:36,174
The cement will be hard in a day.
Thanks to Mr Tonelotti.

124
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:39,705
And on Friday,
we'll have the party.

125
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:42,883
Your 550th play with
your comrades in costumes.

126
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:44,701
Antoine, you're a genius.

127
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:47,337
Thank you, darling.
I'll get ready.

128
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:14,296
Antoine?

129
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,507
Where are you?
- I'm coming.

130
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:19,349
I'm coming down.

131
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:29,675
What were you doing in the garden?
- It's for my new piece.

132
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,679
Are you coming to the theatre?
- I can't.

133
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,291
Do you mind?
- No, I'll let you work.

134
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:41,984
I have to go, or I'll be late.
- Say, Sylvie.

135
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:47,140
Yes,
- Tell me, if someone...

136
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:53,365
...ends our love or
if we have to separate...

137
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,856
We won't, my angel.

138
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:59,902
Promise me we'll die together,
my dearest Sylvie.

139
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:06,542
But of course. You're so serious.
Is it because of the new piece?

140
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:12,495
Maybe, the detective genre isn't...
- You can do it. You'll see.

141
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:19,081
And when I come home tonight,
I'm sure there'll be a corpse.

142
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:38,913
The digging has been done,
the maid left... the doors...

143
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:45,673
Four: get a gun ready.

144
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:53,731
Four: a gun... alright.

145
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:57,855
Five: turn off the lights.

146
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:03,730
Six: I can't see anything.

147
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,712
We should have put this at seven.

148
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:31,151
What are you doing in the dark?
- What do you mean?

149
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:38,053
Don't you feel well?
- I feel very well.

150
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,653
I'm very late.
I forgot my make-up.

151
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,419
Sylvie, did I give you a kiss?

152
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:48,475
You did. Do you want
to give me another one?

153
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:50,209
I do, actually.

154
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:52,867
Aren't you forgetting anything?

155
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,361
You won't be back?
- I don't think so.

156
00:15:56,102 --> 00:16:00,308
Bye, cupcake.
- Bye, sweetie pie.

157
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:16,366
I can't...

158
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:21,803
I can't do it.
I'd rather pay.

159
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:25,212
I can't do it. There.

160
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,796
Oh no! Oh no!

161
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:49,066
Oh no, it's not for real.

162
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:53,424
It's not for real, come on.

163
00:18:57,611 --> 00:19:02,259
You're still working.
- Didn't you go to the cinema?

164
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,051
I was just leaving.
A prop gun.

165
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:11,388
Good evening, Mr Colas.
Have fun.

166
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:22,825
Mr Brisebard?

167
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:26,536
Something terrible happened.
Oh my God!

168
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,506
Mr Brisebard?

169
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:51,394
You were here?
What are you doing here?

170
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:53,862
I was working.
- In that costume?

171
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:56,863
Didn't you hear me?
- No.

172
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:01,373
It's very bad. Mrs Grunder
fell into the hole.

173
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:05,608
What's she doing in my hole?
I need my hole.

174
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:14,957
Why did she fall in?

175
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,968
What?

176
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:18,842
I don't understand.

177
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,368
Give her a cognac.
It'll do her well.

178
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:54,433
Mr Brisebard?

179
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:58,110
Yes?
- Can I give a tour?

180
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:01,143
No, we don't give tours.
It's over. Just go.

181
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:04,622
Go, quickly!

182
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:12,172
I look like a fool.
- Don't force me to comment.

183
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:15,854
Good.

184
00:22:15,855 --> 00:22:17,922
Bye, madam.
- Bye, Mr Brisebard.

185
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:25,984
A bit of cognac.

186
00:22:28,323 --> 00:22:32,522
You forgot Mrs Grunder.

187
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:38,523
You forgot Mrs Grunder.
She's there.

188
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,386
Look, look.

189
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:42,919
My cognac...

190
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:50,930
Come, let's go sleep.

191
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:04,748
Ah, it's you.

192
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,081
Am I interrupting?
- Lights out.

193
00:25:10,082 --> 00:25:13,569
Listen, I can't see anything.
- We have to.

194
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:16,329
Where are you?
- Here, under the lamp.

195
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,908
No, under the lamp.
- Ah!

196
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:25,869
What's with the costume?
- I had a look at the foundation.

197
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:31,471
We've been thinking the same thing.
I found something wrong with it.

198
00:25:31,472 --> 00:25:37,075
What did you see?
- They made a hole in own my hole.

199
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:38,563
A hole?
- A hole!

200
00:25:38,564 --> 00:25:40,224
But where?
- In my own hole.

201
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:42,714
I say.
- And not a small hole.

202
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:47,289
A big hole.
Big enough for a corpse.

203
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,987
What has come of the world. But who?
- I don't know.

204
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:56,821
Maybe one of your workers?
- I closed the hole again.

205
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,285
You closed it?
- Yes.

206
00:25:58,286 --> 00:26:00,399
Why?
- Just because.

207
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,313
Which hole?
- The hole he made.

208
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:04,133
Where?
- In my own hole.

209
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:08,344
You can't have.
- Yes, and they left the shovel outside.

210
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:10,730
It'll rust. I'll return it.
- Give it to me.

211
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:16,281
No, no! We're not going to work now.
Goodnight, sir.

212
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,636
To the gazebo.
- What's that?

213
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:23,005
To the gazebo.
- It's really beautiful.

214
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:25,126
To our love.
- Yes, my darling.

215
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:26,969
Your husband's very happy.

216
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,123
That's because of the gazebo.
My birthday gift to him.

217
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:33,316
Even better than a tie.

218
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:37,663
It's a beautiful gazebo.
- They've got taste.

219
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:40,700
Did you remove the shower curtain?
- What?

220
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,518
The shower curtain. Did you remove it?
- No!

221
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,511
Where is it then?
- Ah, well...

222
00:27:46,512 --> 00:27:49,740
What did you do with it?
- I gave it away.

223
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:53,572
You gave it away? To whom?
- To a poor person.

224
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:58,378
A poor person?
- Yes, he came by and... warm clothes...

225
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:01,468
Warm, and you gave him that?
- Yes.

226
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:04,428
It was raining and...
- Yes?

227
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:05,936
I said to myself...
- What did you say to yourself?

228
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:08,555
I said...
- What did you say?

229
00:28:08,556 --> 00:28:14,118
He could get my coat,
but he was already gone.

230
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,934
What are you saying?
- To the gazebo!

231
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:30,430
Madam, madam!
- Yes.

232
00:28:30,431 --> 00:28:32,069
The Spanish musicians are here.

233
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,035
That's great entertainment.
You'll see...

234
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:37,588
Say...
- Careful, damn.

235
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:38,771
What is it?

236
00:28:38,772 --> 00:28:41,320
A gentleman's asking for you.
- What was that?

237
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:43,468
A gentleman's asking for you.
No, there, there...

238
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:52,608
Sir?
- Police inspector Ducros.

239
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:02,885
Get some champagne for the gentleman.
- No thanks, never when I'm on duty.

240
00:29:04,232 --> 00:29:09,575
It's original, that gazebo.

241
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:16,901
It's from the Puy-de-Dôme and
it's a gazebo.

242
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:19,055
Aha.

243
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:24,920
You wanted to talk to me?
- Yes.

244
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:27,433
Do you know Mr Jo?

245
00:29:28,658 --> 00:29:31,350
Mr who?
- Jo.

246
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,299
Sorry... let me think...

247
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:45,143
Yes, no, Mr Jo... Thinking...
- Think well.

248
00:29:57,988 --> 00:30:00,889
Let's have a drink.
- Is this your maid?

249
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,841
Yes, police inspector Ducros.

250
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:10,558
What's so funny?
- It's just like last night.

251
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,417
What happened?
- Nothing, she went to the cinema.

252
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:20,898
What did you see?
- Sir, shooting somebody.

253
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:24,811
You go on.
- Tell me...

254
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:27,673
Did you kill somebody?
- Yes.

255
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:30,478
Yes?
- Not really, I pretended.

256
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:35,235
I'm working on a detective story and
I often invite a friend.

257
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:38,074
He plays the bad guy, so
I can judge the play.

258
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:40,987
Mr Brisebard, you were right.
It's your shovel.

259
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:43,936
I have no shovel. What can I...
- It's yours.

260
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:46,762
I wanted to see you about the hole.
- Which hole?

261
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:50,994
There is no hole. This is
police inspector Ducros.

262
00:30:50,995 --> 00:30:55,677
Mr Inspector, I don't know
who made this hole.

263
00:30:55,678 --> 00:30:58,616
See? There is a hole.
- There is no hole. He's wrong.

264
00:30:58,617 --> 00:31:04,461
They dance, they jump, no hole.
Look, how beautiful.

265
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:09,854
I drink to what's underneath.
- What's underneath?

266
00:31:09,855 --> 00:31:12,926
There's nothing!
Yes, French soil!

267
00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:15,587
Ah, long live France.

268
00:31:15,588 --> 00:31:18,947
Long live France!
- Long live the gazebo!

269
00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:23,133
Long live the Puy-de-Dôme and
long live peace.

270
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:27,077
Excuse me.
What did you want to say?

271
00:31:27,078 --> 00:31:30,291
I have a hole in my memory.
- Goodbye.

272
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:35,253
I'll give you this beautiful
shovel. Goodbye, Inspector.

273
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,245
Go, come on.

274
00:32:32,757 --> 00:32:35,164
Go recite a poem. A poem.

275
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,131
Help me. You.

276
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:57,663
It was going to last 200 years.
- It's only temporary.

277
00:32:57,664 --> 00:33:00,400
Repair it now.
- I'll be there tomorrow morning.

278
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:02,854
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

279
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:09,506
Mr Inspector.
- Mr Brisebard.

280
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:13,003
About Mr Jo again.
- Mr who?

281
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:14,981
Mr Jo!
- Yes, of course.

282
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:17,548
Can I sit down?
- Of course, do sit down.

283
00:33:29,787 --> 00:33:31,518
What is it?

284
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,978
Have my seat.
- Yes.

285
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,081
Comfortable?
- Absolutely.

286
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:53,679
Perfect. Something's going on.

287
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,960
What happened?
- Mr Jo was a blackmailer.

288
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:58,986
No.
- Yes.

289
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:03,127
We found a list of all his
victims, at his place.

290
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,063
No.
- Yes.

291
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:07,839
That's why I'm here. You're on the list.
- Me?

292
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,599
It's not true.
- Yes, it is.

293
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,490
I thought he must have
contacted you.

294
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:16,917
Bang, bang, dead.
Tell me, Antoine.

295
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,365
The corpse.
- Hello, sir.

296
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:23,578
Let him speak.
- I have an idea to hide the corpse.

297
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:28,224
Is there a corpse?
- No corpse. Champagne but no corpse.

298
00:34:30,395 --> 00:34:33,561
Listen. I thought
it was a good idea.

299
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:45,467
Who's that? -Barrister Colas.
He doesn't know a thing about theatre.

300
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,680
Your barrister...

301
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:53,372
You'd better tell me why
you're on Mr Jo's list.

302
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:56,396
It's a simple routine question.

303
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:58,683
For now.

304
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:06,723
Promise me you won't
tell my wife.

305
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:32,082
I have...

306
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:50,695
I didn't hear a thing.
- I meant to say...

307
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:56,178
...that my wife's Granuda's daughter.
- That's impossible.

308
00:35:56,179 --> 00:36:00,788
Granuda, the crook who...
- Yes.

309
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:03,901
Unbelievable. In 1946?
- 1945!

310
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:06,859
1945...
- 1946, I know my facts!

311
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,262
Unbelievable.

312
00:36:15,377 --> 00:36:18,242
I can't hear. I don't understand.
- I said that your wife...

313
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:25,293
...if she's the daughter of Granuda...
if people knew... her career...

314
00:36:25,294 --> 00:36:29,007
Granuda killed many people.
- Yes, four.

315
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:31,115
No, five.
- Four.

316
00:36:31,116 --> 00:36:33,525
The fifth victim was the train guard.
- I see.

317
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:39,261
A few years ago, a terrible
person wanted to scare Sylvie.

318
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:42,632
He wanted to reveal her identity.
There.

319
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:45,873
I say.

320
00:36:49,022 --> 00:36:53,805
Inspector, the names on that list...
- Yes?

321
00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:56,575
They won't be published, will they?
- Of course not.

322
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:58,793
They'll remain secret.
- Good.

323
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:00,730
All, except one.
- Which one?

324
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:02,444
The one of the murderer.

325
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:08,747
Whose murderer?
- Mr Jo was murdered last night.

326
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:11,683
I beg your pardon?
- I have proof, so...

327
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:17,296
Proof, you have no proof.
- We found him with a hole in his head.

328
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:20,248
Where?
- On the floor.

329
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:22,621
But not here.
- No, at his place.

330
00:37:22,622 --> 00:37:24,577
At his place?
- Yes.

331
00:37:25,254 --> 00:37:31,182
Bye bye. Don't worry, you're not a
murderer. You don't have the face.

332
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:39,959
This is unbelievable.

333
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,074
Who did I bury under the gazebo?

334
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,865
Antoine, where were you?
The guests are already leaving.

335
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,357
Didn't you see Edouard?
- Edouard?

336
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,123
He said he'd be at the party.

337
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:59,667
He should sleep during the night.

338
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:05,870
Edouard, my best friend...

339
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,294
I buried my best friend
under the gazebo.

340
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:12,371
It's really bad.
Hello?

341
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:16,291
Who's speaking?
- Edouard?

342
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:21,131
Is it really you?
Is it really you in person?

343
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:26,300
I'm glad to hear from you!

344
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:29,830
Adrien thought you'd be
at my party.

345
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:33,169
You couldn't make it?
Had a car accident?

346
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,094
Very good. Your
car is a wreck?

347
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:46,559
She's not there?

348
00:38:53,317 --> 00:38:57,176
What's wrong with her?
- Her husband left her...

349
00:38:57,177 --> 00:38:59,594
Did he leave you?
- Yes.

350
00:38:59,595 --> 00:39:02,426
When?
- Tuesday night.

351
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:04,963
Tuesday night?
- Yes.

352
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:07,102
We have to find out where he is.

353
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:11,235
I found him.
He ran off with someone else.

354
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,747
But when?
- Yesterday night.

355
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,826
When?
- Yesterday night, I said.

356
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:20,175
That's good.
- He...

357
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:21,720
Bichard!
- What about Bichard?

358
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:23,720
What happened to Bichard?
- He's been dead for two years.

359
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:29,221
That's good.
- Your husband acts so weird. I'll go...

360
00:39:29,222 --> 00:39:31,773
Hello, Auntie, it's Toitoine.
How's Unkie?

361
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,057
It's Toitoine. You're not
hearing any better, are you?

362
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:37,908
You're not hearing any better!

363
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,050
Does he have the flu? Good!

364
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:47,573
Yes, I'll stay on the phone.
- I'm off.

365
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:49,518
Say hello from me.
- Caroline?

366
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:53,956
Caroline, is anyone
missing in your family?

367
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:55,778
Don't you know?
- What?

368
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:58,110
Théophile.
- What about Théophile?

369
00:39:58,111 --> 00:40:01,644
It's been almost 3 months...
- That's alright then.

370
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:07,000
Listen, he was 93 years old.
Goodbye, Caroline.

371
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:12,942
What's wrong, Antoine?
- Everything's fine, believe me.

372
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:17,165
No, I'm certain, he wasn't
there. Really.

373
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:21,104
Who is it?
- The plumber's wife.

374
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:24,722
She wants to know if he was
at the party.

375
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,909
Antoine, what's wrong?

376
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,783
Go say goodbye to Caroline.
- She's already gone.

377
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:34,274
No, I heard her just now.
- Tonight, to bed at 9, with an aspirin.

378
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:38,613
This is terrible.

379
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,929
A plumber, working overtime
to make some extra money.

380
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:51,179
Mrs Bouillé?
Mr Brisebard speaking.

381
00:40:52,127 --> 00:40:57,713
That plumber who was working
here... does he have children?

382
00:40:57,714 --> 00:41:01,793
Six? It's really terrible.

383
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,314
Are you sure?
He couldn't make it?

384
00:41:06,055 --> 00:41:11,929
He's standing next to you?
Give him three big kisses!

385
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,961
And I'm kissing you too,
Mrs Bouillé.

386
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:20,298
Yes, everything's fine.
Bye bye, Mrs Bouillé.

387
00:41:23,255 --> 00:41:27,675
But who did I bury under the
gazebo?

388
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:31,453
It's me. I have good news,
Mr Brisebard.

389
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:34,880
That strange thing in your garden...
- Yes?

390
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:37,547
The Grunders really love it.
- The Grunders?

391
00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:41,249
Yes, the Grunders...
They want to pay 5 million extra.

392
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,608
How much does that make in total?
- 80 million French francs.

393
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:46,037
Sold!
- And Mrs Brisebard?

394
00:41:46,038 --> 00:41:48,030
Mrs Brisebard...
- Ah!

395
00:41:48,031 --> 00:41:52,833
Sylvie, come here.
You'll see who's in charge here.

396
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:58,343
Sylvie! I just sold the house.
No use disagreeing.

397
00:41:58,344 --> 00:42:01,141
That's fantastic, darling.

398
00:42:06,926 --> 00:42:09,860
Another round.
- Yes, darling.

399
00:42:12,451 --> 00:42:15,876
You're not arguing?
- Why? I'm very happy.

400
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:38,445
Mr Grunder even wrote a
cheque to your name.

401
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,062
Oh, 20 million francs.
- I'll get a bottle of champagne.

402
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,900
20 million extra.
- Thanks to the gazebo.

403
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,792
I need to tell you something.
I think the gazebo's awful.

404
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:59,081
I hate it even.
- So do the Grunders.

405
00:42:59,082 --> 00:43:02,259
They're paying 20 million
extra to have the gazebo removed.

406
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,784
Your husband just needs
to sign this piece of paper.

407
00:43:05,785 --> 00:43:07,939
For the house.
- Of course.

408
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,346
The countryside bores me.
- Ah.

409
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:15,189
Angel, there's something Mrs Cramusel
didn't dare tell you.

410
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,019
Don't say it.
- The house has been sold anyway.

411
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,862
Is it good news?

412
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:23,448
The Grunders want to remove
the gazebo using dynamite.

413
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:27,916
So they have somewhere to
put a swimming pool.

414
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,200
Drink.

415
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:47,495
No.
- Drink. You have to sleep.

416
00:43:47,496 --> 00:43:49,454
No, I need to think.

417
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:07,601
Why do you care that the
Grunders will remove the gazebo?

418
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:10,175
I mind it a lot.

419
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:14,381
You want to sell,
you don't want to sell.

420
00:44:16,702 --> 00:44:18,648
Will you drink this or not?
- I won't drink it.

421
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:22,591
Alright, goodnight.

422
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:30,918
Goodnight, dearest.

423
00:44:33,493 --> 00:44:35,408
Goodnight, dearest.

424
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,839
Goodnight, dearest.

425
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,240
Do you need help?

426
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,410
Where is he?
- Who?

427
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:51,459
Riri.
- I don't know a Riri.

428
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,838
That's the maid.
- Where's the corpse?

429
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,258
Whose corpse?

430
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:10,549
We want to find Riri so much...

431
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,228
...because he took the money.

432
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:17,069
It would be terrible if we didn't
find it.

433
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,438
I don't know what you're
on about.

434
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:22,733
We followed our friend
to your place, last night.

435
00:47:22,734 --> 00:47:24,672
Now do you know what
I'm talking about?

436
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:27,906
We waited all night for him.

437
00:47:27,907 --> 00:47:33,001
He must have left
your place again.

438
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:35,846
Enough talk, Le duc.
- Go for it Big Louis.

439
00:47:38,694 --> 00:47:41,549
What did you do to Riri?

440
00:47:52,747 --> 00:47:53,906
Come on.

441
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,865
It's Riri.

442
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:11,222
He's stuck.
- Well, pull

443
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:13,400
He was never going to
give us the money.

444
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:25,545
The money's here.
Sorry for treating you the way we did.

445
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:28,537
And thanks again for killing
Riri for us.

446
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,089
You have to take him with you.
- What do we want him for?

447
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,764
What about me?
- He's a gift.

448
00:48:34,172 --> 00:48:36,897
God, get me out of this mess.

449
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:46,728
A statue, thank you God!

450
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,027
Antoine?
- Yes?

451
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:18,293
Did you sleep on the couch all night?
- Yes, of course.

452
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:24,152
What's that?
- A statue.

453
00:49:24,153 --> 00:49:27,932
Yes, I know.
- I made it last night.

454
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:42,669
Can I talk to the doctor, please?

455
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,022
Aren't you feeling well?
- It's for you.

456
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:49,965
I feel fine. put the phone down.
Put it down fast!

457
00:49:49,966 --> 00:49:51,544
I'm feeling good.

458
00:49:54,879 --> 00:49:58,410
Antoine, I'm rather worried about you.

459
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:05,864
Sylvie, I never told you that I've
wanted to be a sculptor all my life.

460
00:50:05,865 --> 00:50:08,606
Oh, alright.
- Isn't it beautiful?

461
00:50:08,607 --> 00:50:10,892
What?
- The statue, of course.

462
00:50:10,893 --> 00:50:13,484
It's very beautiful.
- Is it really?

463
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:16,460
Yes.
- Sylvie, I'm pleased.

464
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:21,481
The statue will never leave us.
It'll go into our new living room.

465
00:50:23,037 --> 00:50:27,572
Why do you pull that face?

466
00:50:27,573 --> 00:50:30,291
Antoine...
- I have a right to make statues.

467
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:32,571
Yes, of course.
- I'm not the only one.

468
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,390
Of course, darling.
- Others have done it before me.

469
00:50:34,391 --> 00:50:37,497
I don't need to see a doctor
because I made a statue.

470
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:38,860
Of course not, darling.

471
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:45,004
And I like it.
- That's what it is.

472
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:47,109
Did Rodin ever see a doctor?

473
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,423
He didn't give shower curtains
to strangers.

474
00:50:50,424 --> 00:50:54,162
I've got your play.
What a coincidence.

475
00:50:54,163 --> 00:50:57,716
Your story is the one
of Mr Jo.

476
00:50:57,717 --> 00:50:59,617
I know that.
- Did you read the article?

477
00:50:59,618 --> 00:51:01,323
I didn't read any article.

478
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:06,381
What's this?
- A portrait of my grandmother.

479
00:51:06,382 --> 00:51:09,666
You're not going to leave that here?
- Yes, I am.

480
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:12,319
It's my grandmother.
- Alright.

481
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,725
Don't I have the right...

482
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:16,709
But of course...
- I'm getting changed.

483
00:51:18,935 --> 00:51:22,710
Excuse me, because...
- Yes, no, I understood.

484
00:51:22,711 --> 00:51:27,450
I have things to do.
- What do you say about Mr Jo's story?

485
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:32,024
It's just a stupid
everyday story.

486
00:51:32,025 --> 00:51:35,002
I don't agree. If it was, they
wouldn't put inspector Ducros on it.

487
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:37,671
Inspector Ducros isn't
that great.

488
00:51:37,672 --> 00:51:39,868
Ducros? He catches all
the criminals.

489
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:44,029
Ducros is a loser. He has that,
he has that, but he doesn't have this.

490
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:47,025
Who, Ducros?
He's a special person.

491
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:49,772
I know him better than you.
We went to school together.

492
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,033
We're on a first name basis.

493
00:51:52,034 --> 00:51:56,133
Hello, Antoine, how are you?
- Mr Inspector.

494
00:51:56,134 --> 00:51:58,516
What's wrong? No first name?
- Of course.

495
00:51:58,517 --> 00:51:59,565
Well?

496
00:52:00,653 --> 00:52:02,361
How are you, buddysir?

497
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,983
How are you, sirbuddy?

498
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:07,308
How are you, buddy?

499
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:08,309
That's better.

500
00:52:09,808 --> 00:52:11,485
We've known each other
for a long time.

501
00:52:11,486 --> 00:52:12,530
Sir.
- Sir.

502
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:15,457
Mr... barrister Colas.

503
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,425
He's a barrister with the Crown Court.
- You already got a lawyer?

504
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:23,637
Inspector Ducros, our friend Antoine
is writing a detective story.

505
00:52:23,638 --> 00:52:27,700
Rascal.
Remember when we were young?

506
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:31,061
I know who killed Jo.
- Me too.

507
00:52:31,062 --> 00:52:32,878
What do you mean, me too?

508
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,170
As I said, remember when
we were young...

509
00:52:39,577 --> 00:52:42,175
Would you like a drink?
- What?

510
00:52:42,176 --> 00:52:43,692
What you like a drink?
- What's that?

511
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:47,085
We'll do what?
- Have a drink. I'll get it.

512
00:53:10,728 --> 00:53:14,591
What's that?
- That's his grandmother.

513
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:33,701
This is my grandmother
when she was 15 or 16 years old.

514
00:53:38,086 --> 00:53:39,529
What did you say?

515
00:53:41,246 --> 00:53:43,072
I can't hear you.

516
00:53:43,408 --> 00:53:45,991
Mrs Brisebard.
- My pleasure, madam.

517
00:53:45,992 --> 00:53:49,974
Police inspector Ducros.
- Police, why?

518
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:55,560
I was in the area and thought I'd
visit my best friend.

519
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:01,636
Excuse us.
- Excuse me.

520
00:54:03,965 --> 00:54:05,875
I'm really worried.
- Why?

521
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:10,071
Didn't you notice?
- He's a bit nervous, at the moment.

522
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:13,505
A bit?
- You know him. He's always nervous.

523
00:54:14,497 --> 00:54:18,290
Look at the gazebo.
- The bad weather did that.

524
00:54:21,782 --> 00:54:24,455
It fell.

525
00:54:26,523 --> 00:54:32,148
What's wrong?
- Look at this.

526
00:54:32,149 --> 00:54:36,074
I promised him it would last
200 years.

527
00:54:36,075 --> 00:54:38,800
I've lost face.
- But no, calm down.

528
00:54:38,801 --> 00:54:43,164
We'll get you a glass of wine.
You'll feel a lot better.

529
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:49,020
Sit down.

530
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,658
You're hard to follow, Mr Brisebard.
Sit down.

531
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:05,737
Why would you hide things
amongst old friends?

532
00:55:05,738 --> 00:55:10,744
Mr Colas told me that he
knew someone famous...

533
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:14,639
...and I told him I knew someone
who's even more famous.

534
00:55:15,444 --> 00:55:19,101
Me? Thank you.
- You're very famous, you know.

535
00:55:19,102 --> 00:55:21,254
Everybody talks about you.

536
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:26,674
You're a good, friendly inspector.
- Very friendly.

537
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:32,283
That speaks for itself when
you're making things up.

538
00:55:36,536 --> 00:55:37,971
Sit down.

539
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:43,806
Since you like stories,
what about this one...

540
00:55:45,806 --> 00:55:50,066
Once, there was a well-liked man.

541
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:54,623
One day, he meets a guy
with bad intentions.

542
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,523
Let's say, Mr Jo.

543
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:57,516
To keep it simple.

544
00:55:57,853 --> 00:55:58,852
Who?
- Jo.

545
00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:01,967
Riri.

546
00:56:02,481 --> 00:56:04,296
Who?
- Riri.

547
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:08,078
Another bad guy...
Jo's accomplice.

548
00:56:08,628 --> 00:56:10,942
He often collected money.

549
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:14,172
For him.
- I see.

550
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:17,628
And?
- After they kill Jo...

551
00:56:17,629 --> 00:56:23,148
...Riri takes the money and finds
a note about a meeting with a man.

552
00:56:23,149 --> 00:56:28,520
He goes to that man
to teach him a lesson.

553
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:33,457
He was probably armed.
Our good friend got scared and shot him.

554
00:56:37,442 --> 00:56:40,951
That's how Riri was killed
instead of Jo.

555
00:56:43,342 --> 00:56:50,777
And now our good man has to get rid of
a corpse, without knowing who it is.

556
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:52,930
Congratulations.

557
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:55,684
Congratulations, inspector.
You should thank the inspector.

558
00:56:55,685 --> 00:56:57,603
It's a good story for his play.
- But no...

559
00:56:57,604 --> 00:57:02,573
Yes, that's your play and you
were looking for a part for me.

560
00:57:02,574 --> 00:57:04,062
But no!
- But yes!

561
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:09,689
Jo comes in during the night.
I fire, he falls down.

562
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:12,781
And the next day, I find out
I killed the wrong one.

563
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:17,700
God, who did I kill?
Who?

564
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:19,802
I call all my friends. You know,
like you did last night.

565
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:24,551
Hello Trude, hello Macha.
And we have to get rid of the body.

566
00:57:24,552 --> 00:57:25,931
And...

567
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:45,077
What's wrong with her?
- I'll be a father.

568
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:46,581
Get a glass of water.

569
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:57,015
What do we do now?
- Search the garden and the gazebo.

570
00:57:57,016 --> 00:57:59,517
Either there's a body
or I'm an idiot.

571
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,614
Yes, boss.
- What?

572
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:02,052
That's my opinion as well.
- What?

573
00:58:02,053 --> 00:58:04,884
That you're on the right track.
- Good.

574
00:58:07,731 --> 00:58:10,247
Drink.
- When will it be born?

575
00:58:10,248 --> 00:58:12,282
Born what?
- The child.

576
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:15,095
In 6 months, 8 months,
12 months. I don't know.

577
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:17,170
We're not in a hurry, you know.
Drink.

578
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:18,627
I'll be right back.

579
00:58:22,485 --> 00:58:26,490
Mr Brisebard, the Grunders have arrived.
Are you selling or not?

580
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:28,758
Let them buy quickly.

581
00:58:30,445 --> 00:58:32,170
What's wrong?
- What's that?

582
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:36,176
That's my grandmother.
- Who made this?

583
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:37,177
I did.

584
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:45,333
Antoine, why did you
hide this from me?

585
00:58:49,887 --> 00:58:52,394
I'll explain everything.
- Yes.

586
00:59:00,657 --> 00:59:03,689
There's nothing there, boss.
- Then I'm an idiot.

587
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:08,864
There.

588
00:59:08,865 --> 00:59:14,413
Darling, do you love me that much?
From now on, we're in it together.

589
00:59:14,414 --> 00:59:16,557
You'll see how I handle this.

590
00:59:20,764 --> 00:59:21,726
Am I interrupting?

591
00:59:22,807 --> 00:59:25,367
I want to speak to your husband.

592
00:59:34,013 --> 00:59:37,385
Come in. You'll see the house
is beautiful.

593
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:44,962
See? It's really beautiful.

594
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:49,472
It's very hot.
- I thought it was rather cold.

595
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:53,732
This is Mr Brisebard's
grandmother.

596
00:59:53,733 --> 00:59:57,682
You know his charming wife.
- Hello.

597
01:00:04,575 --> 01:00:07,550
Maybe I should wear my bathing suit.
- Enough of these games.

598
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,622
You helped your husband hide
the body, didn't you?

599
01:00:09,623 --> 01:00:12,123
Which body?
- That's enough, the both of you.

600
01:00:12,124 --> 01:00:15,099
You dissolved it in sulphuric acid.
- Is that possible?

601
01:00:15,963 --> 01:00:18,140
We're going to change our tune.

602
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:19,849
Boss?
- Get Andrieux.

603
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,354
Andrieux.
- Get Plumerel.

604
01:00:25,105 --> 01:00:26,945
Here, boss.
- Alright.

605
01:00:33,901 --> 01:00:36,116
The plumber's here.
- Show him the bathroom.

606
01:00:36,117 --> 01:00:37,587
Please follow me.

607
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:51,856
As you can see, it's very quiet here.
Come, the kitchen's over there.

608
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,764
Darling, your husband
still hasn't come back?

609
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:58,728
No.
- This isn't the moment. Come.

610
01:01:00,776 --> 01:01:02,297
It's a madhouse here.

611
01:01:02,665 --> 01:01:06,100
Mrs Brisebard, has the gazebo gone yet?
- Yes.

612
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:07,140
Look at this.

613
01:01:10,008 --> 01:01:13,743
We'll search from the attic
to the basement, you hear?

614
01:01:13,744 --> 01:01:17,791
If we don't find anything,
I'll apologise. -No!

615
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:21,035
You're starting to lose it, aren't you?
- Yes.

616
01:01:23,606 --> 01:01:25,096
Anybody here?

617
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:30,087
Sir, registered mail for
Mrs Brisebard.

618
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:04,070
Antoine, this isn't the moment.

619
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:05,414
Wait here for me.
- No!

620
01:02:05,415 --> 01:02:06,747
Wait here.
- No!

621
01:02:06,748 --> 01:02:09,950
Do you mind waiting here?
- No, I don't want to...

622
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:27,291
Come, help me.
- What?

623
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:29,152
Help me!

624
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:31,114
Please help me.

625
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:33,178
Antoine, come here.

626
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:34,752
Antoine, good man...

627
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:37,670
I'm not going to do this
on my own, am I?

628
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,358
Come on.

629
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:43,911
Help me.

630
01:02:43,912 --> 01:02:45,537
Quick, get rid of this.

631
01:02:47,278 --> 01:02:49,037
1, 2, 3...

632
01:02:52,761 --> 01:02:56,047
Backward, backward I say.
- It's heavy...

633
01:03:00,204 --> 01:03:02,380
No, that way.

634
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:05,303
I can't go on.
- That way.

635
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:13,586
Antoine, did you hurt
yourself, darling?

636
01:03:15,047 --> 01:03:18,464
He's too long.
- We'll cut him up.

637
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:21,748
Put the feet in.

638
01:03:22,457 --> 01:03:23,991
Not your feet!

639
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,014
There we go.
- He's so heavy.

640
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:42,796
His head. Give me your shirt.
- No, I don't want to.

641
01:03:42,797 --> 01:03:46,881
My shirt...
- So many buttons...

642
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,970
No, no!

643
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:53,988
This really isn't the moment.

644
01:03:55,325 --> 01:03:57,225
This is the room.

645
01:03:58,644 --> 01:04:04,035
And there... the dining room.

646
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:17,429
Antoine, Antoine, come here.
Listen. like this. Alright?

647
01:04:20,026 --> 01:04:22,386
Pull, but pull.

648
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:27,770
Push.

649
01:04:43,189 --> 01:04:44,559
Let's go look at the rooms.

650
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:55,311
Go get a saw.

651
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:20,771
Say, the garage is locked.
- What do you want me to do about it?

652
01:05:20,772 --> 01:05:23,608
The key, quick.
- The key's in the kitchen.

653
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,591
What happened to your grandmother?

654
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:26,591
She's dead!

655
01:05:35,317 --> 01:05:44,540
Antoine, come here.
Get changed quickly.

656
01:05:45,432 --> 01:05:47,467
Get dressed!

657
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:52,052
Antoine, this isn't the moment.

658
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:19,786
Thanks!

659
01:06:24,646 --> 01:06:26,085
Andrieux...

660
01:06:38,785 --> 01:06:40,723
Well?

661
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:54,887
No...
- The door bell. Open the door.

662
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,344
Sir?
- Hello sir.

663
01:06:59,345 --> 01:07:03,406
Nice day, isn't it? Excuse me.
- Hey you!

664
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:06,432
I often visit people.
It's my job.

665
01:07:06,433 --> 01:07:10,042
I used to be a public servant and now
I give demonstrations at people's homes.

666
01:07:10,043 --> 01:07:13,067
So I'm used to giving
demonstrations.

667
01:07:13,068 --> 01:07:15,830
One demonstration and
you'll buy it.

668
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,776
Antoine.
- Yes.

669
01:07:17,777 --> 01:07:19,160
Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

670
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:22,503
It will only take a few seconds.
Don't panic.

671
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:25,361
Antoine.
- There.

672
01:07:25,362 --> 01:07:30,317
And now I'll light it.
- Antoine!

673
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:31,317
Yes.

674
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:35,800
No problem at all.

675
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:38,115
What's wrong?
- In the clock, quickly.

676
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:39,116
Quickly.
- Yes.

677
01:07:39,117 --> 01:07:40,117
It's not opening.

678
01:07:45,338 --> 01:07:47,048
Quickly, please.

679
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,666
Fire!

680
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:58,246
Fire!
- What's happening?

681
01:07:58,725 --> 01:08:01,226
Quickly, water.

682
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:22,453
This is a good bit for the new play.

683
01:08:26,743 --> 01:08:28,874
Get that idiot out of here.

684
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:29,875
Come along.

685
01:08:31,704 --> 01:08:34,154
Come, we'll fix you up.

686
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:35,754
I'll get a screwdriver.

687
01:08:37,165 --> 01:08:40,881
Let me help you.
Are you alright?

688
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:44,311
Thanks!
- That's the least I can do.

689
01:08:45,639 --> 01:08:46,686
Brisebard.

690
01:08:49,408 --> 01:08:50,578
Brisebard.

691
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:55,468
Brisebard. Where's your husband?
- He's somewhere...

692
01:09:05,722 --> 01:09:09,074
How does he do that?
- He's a Sunday's child.

693
01:09:09,075 --> 01:09:12,973
Sunday, Monday, I'm
not wasting any more time here.

694
01:09:13,638 --> 01:09:14,902
I don't need any more headaches.

695
01:09:20,253 --> 01:09:24,854
Your wife's asking for you.

696
01:09:29,906 --> 01:09:31,432
I've got the screwdriver.
- Finally.

697
01:09:38,502 --> 01:09:40,958
Do you want to see the rest?

698
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:45,789
I think I've seen it all.

699
01:09:55,259 --> 01:09:59,688
Where's inspector Ducros? It's urgent.
- In the kitchen.

700
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:00,688
Thank you.

701
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:06,550
We're off. See you soon.
- It was fun.

702
01:10:11,067 --> 01:10:16,318
Sir, we're off.
Wait, let me help.

703
01:10:55,371 --> 01:11:00,233
Quick, we'll be back.
I bet it's not Riri's corpse.

704
01:11:17,717 --> 01:11:20,818
When we're out at sea,
out of the window.

705
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:28,234
You'll see, it'll be
a nice cruise.

706
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:39,224
I didn't want all this.
- Do you regret telling me?

707
01:11:39,225 --> 01:11:43,213
No, of course not.
I just hope he fits.

708
01:11:43,214 --> 01:11:46,336
Try it, while I call a
travel agent.

709
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:52,808
Where to? I don't know. Tahiti?

710
01:11:53,734 --> 01:11:59,103
No Tahiti for the next three weeks.
- Find something else.

711
01:12:02,673 --> 01:12:04,376
Singapore, the day after tomorrow,
is perfect.

712
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:09,322
Tell me, how big are the
windows of the ship?

713
01:12:11,257 --> 01:12:14,356
Would 40 cm be enough?
- Height or width?

714
01:12:14,357 --> 01:12:17,204
I think height.
- At least 50 cm. At least.

715
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:18,204
Alright 50 then.

716
01:12:23,357 --> 01:12:27,289
A window of 50 cm.
You'd do me a big favour.

717
01:12:37,443 --> 01:12:38,726
Where's your husband?

718
01:12:41,513 --> 01:12:44,467
Sit down. I'll get him.
- Find him.

719
01:12:46,377 --> 01:12:49,754
What do you want from him now?
- Have you got a warrant?

720
01:12:49,755 --> 01:12:50,755
I do now.

721
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:59,836
Ah, you're going on a trip.
You're running away.

722
01:13:00,602 --> 01:13:05,979
What's in there?
- Nothing. We're looking for the key.

723
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,980
Of course.

724
01:13:08,861 --> 01:13:10,287
There he is, boss.

725
01:13:11,544 --> 01:13:14,127
What are you doing there?
- I'm writing my story.

726
01:13:14,272 --> 01:13:17,979
And what's with her?
- Must be the baby.

727
01:13:18,453 --> 01:13:21,895
She shouldn't get worked up.
- Is that why you're in the suitcase?

728
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:25,058
Enough with the comedy, you two.
We found the corpse...

729
01:13:25,059 --> 01:13:28,167
...of Big Louis with a hole in his head.
- We don't know that person.

730
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:31,316
It means Riri killed Big Louis
before coming here.

731
01:13:31,317 --> 01:13:38,203
Haven't you seen Riri yet?
- Have mercy father. I mean inspector.

732
01:13:38,204 --> 01:13:39,203
We're not getting anywhere here.

733
01:13:39,204 --> 01:13:44,071
Plumerel, the floors. Andrieux in
the car. I'll start in the basement.

734
01:13:44,072 --> 01:13:46,765
Do you have an oven?
- Won't work because of the golden teeth.

735
01:13:46,766 --> 01:13:49,064
What?
- Make yourself at home.

736
01:13:49,065 --> 01:13:50,566
Indeed!

737
01:13:54,803 --> 01:13:57,011
We're almost there.

738
01:13:57,299 --> 01:14:02,164
We have to get him out.
There's no time for that.

739
01:14:03,112 --> 01:14:06,107
I can't go on.
- We have to get him out.

740
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:27,406
Why do you look at me like that?
- Never put mustard on the salami.

741
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:29,289
It's a crime.

742
01:14:30,847 --> 01:14:32,678
The key. I'll get it.

743
01:14:34,245 --> 01:14:40,278
Well, dear man, how do you feel now?
- Better than in the clock, isn't it?

744
01:14:41,135 --> 01:14:45,206
Stop the comedy.
Poor Riri, killed by crazy people.

745
01:14:45,207 --> 01:14:46,907
Come out.
- He can't.

746
01:14:46,908 --> 01:14:51,028
Come out, Brisebard.
- The gendarmerie's on the phone.

747
01:14:54,695 --> 01:14:57,138
Tonelotti's van is in
the back of our garden.

748
01:15:05,121 --> 01:15:08,668
Yes, stay there. I'm coming.

749
01:15:09,912 --> 01:15:13,874
And?
- They found Le duc's car.

750
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:16,311
Inside it were Riri's things
and 32 thousand francs.

751
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:18,450
Then I think...
- Don't think, I'm in a hurry.

752
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:46,609
Brisebard.

753
01:15:47,742 --> 01:15:48,940
Come here.

754
01:16:22,431 --> 01:16:29,464
I want to apologise. It was clearly a
case of criminals killing each other.

755
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:33,282
Riri was ambushed after he came here
and the smartest one kept the money.

756
01:16:34,059 --> 01:16:37,362
As for Riri's corpse... we'll search
the entire region until we find it.

757
01:16:37,363 --> 01:16:40,176
It's easy to hide a corpse
for a professional killer.

758
01:16:40,177 --> 01:16:43,088
Only for a professional...
- Yes.

759
01:16:43,539 --> 01:16:49,103
I apologise again. If you need anything,
please let me know at phone number 17.

760
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,537
It's number 14.
- 14 is the telegraph.

761
01:16:51,772 --> 01:16:53,600
What about the fire department then?
- The fire department's 18.

762
01:16:53,601 --> 01:16:55,550
If you need information, press 12.

763
01:16:55,551 --> 01:16:56,551
Goodbye.

764
01:17:01,229 --> 01:17:05,045
And you almost lost hope.
- Tonelotti!

765
01:17:05,046 --> 01:17:06,046
The trunk!

766
01:17:23,543 --> 01:17:26,123
My trunk.
Where's my trunk, Mr Tonelotti.

767
01:17:26,124 --> 01:17:27,124
My trunk.

768
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:30,328
Antoine, stop.
- My trunk.

769
01:17:33,413 --> 01:17:36,353
Antoine.
- Where's my trunk?

770
01:17:48,368 --> 01:17:51,851
The bastard.
- You should have let me deal with it.

771
01:17:54,722 --> 01:17:57,812
You really don't want a drink?
- Never on duty.

772
01:17:57,813 --> 01:17:58,812
Alright then...

773
01:18:06,022 --> 01:18:07,531
Mr Brisebard?
- Yes.

774
01:18:07,532 --> 01:18:08,563
Mrs Brisebard.
- Yes.

775
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:10,418
Is this your trunk?
- No.

776
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,378
Yes, it's yours.
Come have a look.

777
01:18:14,379 --> 01:18:17,586
Look well. It's yours.
It says so.

778
01:18:18,322 --> 01:18:19,839
Now that you mention it.
- See?

779
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,400
It was found on a public road,
so we're returning it.

780
01:18:24,401 --> 01:18:27,549
If we didn't have the police...
- Indeed, madam.

781
01:18:27,973 --> 01:18:32,599
I'm glad to have been of service.
It was our pleasure.

782
01:18:33,436 --> 01:18:41,101
I'm quite a fan of yours, your talent.
But I don't go to the theatre often.

783
01:18:42,155 --> 01:18:47,705
Tickets are expensive, unfortunately.
- From now on, it's free for you.

784
01:18:48,106 --> 01:18:50,096
Madam... madam...

785
01:19:03,737 --> 01:19:04,708
We're going!

786
01:19:11,394 --> 01:19:13,721
I can go to the rehearsal
after all.

787
01:19:14,272 --> 01:19:17,122
And him in there?
What about him?

788
01:19:17,123 --> 01:19:19,279
You have a lot of time to
think about it.

789
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,722
You have such a lively
imagination.

790
01:20:07,714 --> 01:20:10,297
Brisebard! Brisebard!

791
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:17,248
