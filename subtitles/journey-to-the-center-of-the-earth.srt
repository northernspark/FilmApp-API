2
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,111
Trevor!

3
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:12,420
Max.

4
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,143
Whoa, whoa.

5
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:46,581
Although Wegener was ridiculed
by the scientific community...

6
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:48,726
...he was eventually found
to be correct...

7
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:51,920
...in his theory of an original
supercontinent called Pangaea.

8
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:55,090
Yeah. Okay.

9
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:04,233
Ah. Come to papa.

10
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,305
Hey, Leonard.

11
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:08,812
Hey, man.

12
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,177
- Dude, you ain't gonna be happy.
- Why?

13
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,648
- It's Kitzens.
- I see.

14
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:18,245
- Hello.
- Trevor, there's my favorite colleague.

15
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:19,754
- How are you, Alan?
- I'm good.

16
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:22,189
- How's that Con Drift class of yours going?
- Fine.

17
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,954
Does it get echoey in there
with so few students?

18
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,966
So, what do you got on the books?
I'm busy.

19
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:32,331
No, no, I can see how busy you are.

20
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,701
So I'll try to be
as quick as possible here.

21
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:39,435
The university is pulling the plug
on your brother's lab.

22
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:40,635
Pulling the plug?

23
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:43,713
Yeah, it's gonna finally give us
all the storage space we need.

24
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:46,817
Let's get something straight here,
this facility is dedicated...

25
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:50,887
...to the research of Maxwell Anderson's
theories predicting the volcanic fissures...

26
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:52,614
Which have never been proven.

27
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:57,888
I mean, how many of your late brother's
sensors are even still active? One, two...?

28
00:03:58,063 --> 00:03:59,530
- Three.
- It used to be 29.

29
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,666
This is the wrong time to shut us down.

30
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:06,600
I have got seismic activity in Bolivia.
I got a 13 millimeter shift in Mongolia.

31
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:08,966
Alan, you can't shut us down.
Keep the lab open.

32
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,543
- It's all I've got left of Max.
- It's been 10 years since Max, Trevor.

33
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:18,009
I am sorry about all this. I really am.

34
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,259
<i>Trevor, are you there? It's Elizabeth.</i>

35
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:34,659
<i>Pick up, please.</i>

36
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:39,167
<i>Okay. Well, uh, we are on the 95,</i>
<i>and we're heading your way.</i>

37
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:41,601
<i>You wanna say hi</i>
<i>to your Uncle Trevor, Sean?</i>

38
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:43,434
<i>No.</i>

39
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,200
<i>Just say hello.</i>
- No.

40
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:47,902
<i>I don't want to.</i>
- Oh, no.

41
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:50,340
<i>Hey, it's your sister-in-law again.</i>

42
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:52,847
<i>Just wanted to make sure</i>
<i>what time you'd be home...</i>

43
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,781
<i>... because we'll be there around 6.</i>

44
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,744
<i>Okay. Well, we'll be on my cell.</i>

45
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,789
- Oh, boy.
- <i>Sean's looking forward to seeing you.</i>

46
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,425
- <i>Right, Sean?</i>
- <i>Negatory.</i>

47
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,391
<i>I'm getting worried that</i>
<i>we might've gotten our signals crossed.</i>

48
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:05,723
<i>Please call me.</i>

49
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,429
<i>I'm not home. Leave me a message.</i>

50
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,467
<i>Trevor, we're pulling up</i>
<i>in front of your building.</i>

51
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,279
Trevor, you in there?

52
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,308
Hi.

53
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,746
- Hey.
- How are you, Elizabeth?

54
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,287
- Oh, you're home.
- It's so good to see you.

55
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,856
You too.

56
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:37,926
- How are you? I just got your messages.
- Uh-huh.

57
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:41,190
- You forgot, didn't you?
- I didn't forget.

58
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,628
How could I forget?

59
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,291
- You didn't forget?
- I...

60
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:49,636
I forgot.
It doesn't mean I haven't been...

61
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,799
...looking forward
to time with my nephew.

62
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,842
I haven't seen him since he was 9?

63
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:56,310
- Seven.
- Wow. Ha-ha.

64
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,711
So how long
is he gonna be staying again?

65
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,444
- Ten days.
- Is that what we said?

66
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,714
Hey, Sean. How are you?

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,616
Looking good.

68
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:10,024
- Is that one of those Game Boys?
- It's a PSP.

69
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:14,393
- Cool.
- Sean, get up, say hi to your uncle.

70
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:18,297
Hi to your uncle.

71
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:24,241
Last time I saw you,
you were about this high.

72
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,173
- Oh! Ha-ha.
- Yeah, good one.

73
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:31,407
You got that?
Okay, you've got all my numbers.

74
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,881
You've got your ticket
and passport in your bag.

75
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:36,077
I will be there to pick you up in Ottawa.

76
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:40,054
And by then I'll have found us a house
and we can start on this big new adventure.

77
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:42,216
- Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
- Yeah, it's great.

78
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:45,261
We get to be Canadians. Thrilling, eh?

79
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:48,659
Just let yourself in.

80
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,832
- It will be good for him, being with you.
- Yeah.

81
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:56,064
Who knows?
Maybe it will be good for you too.

82
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,008
This is for you.

83
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:04,341
What...? Is this Sean's?

84
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:06,416
No, it's Max's.

85
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:08,950
- Max's?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:29,196
So, hey, dude. This is gonna be fun.

87
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:30,807
A couple of dudes hanging out.

88
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:32,442
Five days, maybe a week.

89
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,101
You know, doing dude stuff,
what dudes do.

90
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:38,307
You like baseball?
You know what we should do?

91
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:40,212
We should go get in a batting cage.

92
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:44,116
Yeah, okay, listen.
I don't like this any more than you do.

93
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,484
As long as you keep stocked
with Mountain Dew...

94
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:49,422
...and TiVo <i>Family Guy,</i>
we'll get along fine.

95
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,119
- Sure.
- Oh, wow.

96
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,663
- That's an awesome coin collection.
- Oh.

97
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,269
Well, kind of a pet project of mine.

98
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:02,395
- Yeah, it's really nifty.
- Thanks.

99
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,936
You hungry?
We could order in, you know.

100
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,705
Maybe some pizza, Chinese, Thai food?

101
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,472
Subs? Or something like that?

102
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:15,485
- Wow.
- What's that?

103
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:22,182
Well, it's a box of possessions
of a really great guy.

104
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,850
Your dad.

105
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,427
His old ball glove.

106
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,864
Mom doesn't talk about him very much.

107
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:33,731
Well, you can take my word for it.

108
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:36,237
He was one of those few people...

109
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:41,140
...who are just exceptional
at everything they do.

110
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:47,950
Ooh. You see this?
This was your old man's PSP.

111
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:50,718
- A yo-yo?
- Don't be dissing the yo-yo.

112
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,483
This is physics at work.
You got your centrifugal force.

113
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,320
Your gravitational pull,
you got your potential energy.

114
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,291
And in ancient times, did you know...

115
00:08:58,463 --> 00:09:01,626
...that this was actually used
as a hunting implement?

116
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,824
Watch.

117
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,701
- Hey, here, let me try.
- Yeah, you should probably take it.

118
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,804
I have no idea what this is.

119
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,176
Hello.

120
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,957
This was his favorite book.

121
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:31,158
Jules Verne's
<i>A Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>

122
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:36,060
You know, I think that was
on my summer reading list once.

123
00:09:36,234 --> 00:09:40,500
- I never got to it.
- That's too bad, it's a good read.

124
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:45,371
To him, it wasn't just science fiction,
it was inspiration.

125
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:49,578
He used to read this to me
when I was a really little kid.

126
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,681
Hello. What are these notes?

127
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:07,256
"Magma temperatures reach 1150
in Mongolia"?

128
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,033
"Bolivia."

129
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,365
"Hawaii."

130
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:16,304
Look out!

131
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:26,206
Hey, Sean, let's go check out my lab.

132
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,914
So it couldn't wait for tomorrow?

133
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:33,046
"Tectonophysics is the science of now,
not tomorrow."

134
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:35,749
It's about seismic events
that occur in an instant.

135
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,792
Here, look at this.

136
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:42,731
You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia.

137
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:46,234
And the conditions today are almost
exactly what they were in July '97.

138
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:48,531
What's the big deal about July '97?

139
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:51,300
Sean, that was the year
that your dad went missing.

140
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:54,639
Now, look, you see this column
of numbers here?

141
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:59,707
If the 753, right here, was a 752,
then it would be...

142
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:08,684
Exactly the same.

143
00:11:10,728 --> 00:11:13,925
What do these little blips mean?

144
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:17,090
Don't touch anything.
Those little blips are my life's work.

145
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:19,668
These four little blips
are your entire life's work?

146
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:22,266
Three. Three little blips.

147
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:28,469
One, two, three, four.

148
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:34,642
Iceland.

149
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,548
This makes sense.

150
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:39,849
Max saw the readings 10 years ago,
and he took off to investigate.

151
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:43,482
Now, if the readings are the same today
as they were then...

152
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,221
...this may be my only chance
to find out what happened.

153
00:11:46,397 --> 00:11:48,456
- I'm gonna need your passport.
- For what?

154
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada
a little earlier than we planned.

155
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,933
What are you talking about?

156
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:58,667
I'm talking about this.
<i>A Journey to the Center of the Earth.</i>

157
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:04,314
It's all set in Iceland,
which is where he must've gone.

158
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:06,548
These are all my dad's notes?

159
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:11,377
Look...

160
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,191
...Max and l...

161
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:21,321
Your dad and I were talking about
the possibility of volcanic tubes existing...

162
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:25,094
...that went down past the mantle,
towards the center of the Earth.

163
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,533
And that's what I think
he went looking for.

164
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,906
Sorry, I gotta put you on a flight
to Ottawa in the morning.

165
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:33,100
- And I'm calling Icelandair.
- No, no, look.

166
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:35,943
- Hey.
- I just got here, okay?

167
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,706
You're not gonna go and ditch me.

168
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:42,478
I was the person who found your life's work
fourth little blip thingy in the first place.

169
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:45,144
- This is my brother we're talking about.
- It's my dad.

170
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:48,383
Now, I don't have to be in Ottawa
for 10 days. I'm going with you.

171
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,050
Know how much to book
a last-minute flight to Reykjavík?

172
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,992
Something tells me you got it covered.

173
00:13:06,677 --> 00:13:10,443
"Descend, bold traveler,
into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels...

174
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:14,210
...which the shadow of Scartaris touches
before the kalends of July...

175
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:16,580
...and you will attain
the center of the Earth."

176
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,382
Ooh.

177
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:20,484
Sorry.

178
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:26,493
What are you doing?

179
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:29,724
I'm deciphering these notations
that your father made in this book.

180
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:32,426
I think there's a code
behind the pairing of letters.

181
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,094
It might have something to do
with the periodic table.

182
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,241
For instance, I've got S-A, I-S, G-G.

183
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:41,603
I believe that P-B is on the periodic table
and that's plumbum.

184
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,909
- Plumbum means lead.
- What's "Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson"?

185
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:47,642
What?

186
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:50,681
Well, it's right here. Read it down.
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson.

187
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,219
Oh. Uh...

188
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:57,384
Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson, that's...

189
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,621
That's a clue. Maybe that's a place.

190
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,096
It could be a thing.

191
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:06,069
- What are you doing?
- I am Googling at 30,000 feet.

192
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:09,604
- Are you supposed to be doing that?
- Welcome to the 21 st century.

193
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,265
- Okay. Here.
- It's a person.

194
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:14,636
"Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson,
executive director...

195
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,372
...of Ásgeirsson Institute
for Progressive Volcanology."

196
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:19,038
Max would've known this guy.

197
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:24,052
I knew it was a good thing to bring you.
His institute has gotta be our first stop.

198
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,922
Are we there yet?

199
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:34,189
If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there.

200
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:37,758
- You know, you're going kind of slow.
- I'm going kind of safe.

201
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:40,529
I just saw a goat in the passing lane.

202
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,764
When's the whole adventure thing
gonna begin?

203
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,669
Let me give you something fun to do.

204
00:14:45,443 --> 00:14:47,343
Navigate.

205
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,410
Where are we?

206
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:55,041
Have we passed Havanschlicht?

207
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:57,619
- Havanschlicht?
- Yeah.

208
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,881
I don't know.

209
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:02,218
Have we passed Eingarsstadir?

210
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:03,917
- I don't know.
- Reynivír?

211
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:05,494
- I don't know.
- Húsavík?

212
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:06,925
No.
- Grundarhol?

213
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:09,396
No.
- Stifflarschtarder?

214
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,761
Stifflardschtarder?

215
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:15,372
How about Koldukardarskinoquue?
- What?

216
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,606
We're definitely lost.
- We're not lost.

217
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:20,141
Just look for an institution.

218
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:24,873
What's an institution look like?
- I don't know, it looks big and institutional.

219
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,381
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

220
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:32,712
Hey, look, there's a little shack up there.
We can stop there and ask for directions.

221
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,552
- We're not lost.
- Oh, no, definitely not.

222
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:43,661
What's this? A ski shack?

223
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:45,728
"Ásgeirsson...

224
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,035
...lnstitute for Progressive Volcanology."

225
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:50,640
I told you I'd find it.

226
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:52,207
Alrighty.

227
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:55,607
- Not too shabby.
- All right.

228
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:02,651
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.

229
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,758
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hello.

230
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:12,462
- I'm Hannah.
- Oh, how do you do? Hi.

231
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,658
I'm Trev... Professor Anderson.
I'm visiting from America. Um...

232
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:21,137
- This is Sean, my nephew.
- I'm Sean.

233
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,266
Hi, Sean.

234
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,808
I was wondering if I could
possibly speak with, forgive me here...

235
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,843
...Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson?

236
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,047
Um...

237
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:33,410
Well, Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson is dead.

238
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:36,778
- Dead?
- Yeah, he died three winters ago.

239
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,285
Oh. Uh...

240
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,048
So do you run the institute?

241
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,158
Nobody does. There is no institute.

242
00:16:42,326 --> 00:16:46,660
- There's a sign down the road that says...
- Progressive volcanology was a failed idea.

243
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:50,494
Like, you know, the Berlin Wall
and eight-track tapes.

244
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,502
I see.

245
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:54,602
Well, did you work with him?

246
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,637
No, no. He was my father.

247
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,975
Yeah? I know it. What about it?

248
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,811
Well, this book belonged
to my late brother, Max.

249
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,009
Max Anderson?

250
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:13,885
We believe that he may have been
in contact with your father.

251
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:17,050
- Your brother was a Vernian.
- What's a Vernian?

252
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:20,823
Someone that believes that the writings
of Jules Verne were actual fact.

253
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:24,400
I mean, the guy
was a science fiction writer.

254
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:28,299
And yet this society of believers
regarded Verne like a visionary.

255
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:31,339
My father
was the biggest Vernian of them all.

256
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,875
My brother was no Vernian.

257
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,845
This was my father's copy.

258
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,683
Take a look.

259
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:53,688
See, the markings are exactly the same.
Your brother was a Vernian.

260
00:17:56,367 --> 00:18:00,201
Wow, my dad was kind of out there.

261
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,568
- You didn't know him, Sean.
- I'm starting to think you didn't either.

262
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:06,369
He was no member
of some secret society.

263
00:18:06,977 --> 00:18:10,674
- What are you guys doing here?
- I'm a scientist, I'm a professor.

264
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:14,545
I'm here because there are seismic sensors
going off 30 klicks north of here...

265
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,687
...that we think
that we should check into.

266
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:19,448
And that's the reason that we're here,
plain and simple.

267
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,881
Okay.

268
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,391
You know,
there are no roads to the north.

269
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,154
Well...

270
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,094
I'm a mountain guide.
I can take you there, professor.

271
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,429
- Great.
- That's great, I love hiking.

272
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:34,298
- I would appreciate that. That'd be great.
- Good.

273
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:37,674
- Call me Trevor.
- You can call me Sean.

274
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:40,208
So it will be 5000 kronur to go up there.

275
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:42,107
Five grand a day? No problem.

276
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:43,905
An hour.

277
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:48,013
Do you accept rolls of quarters?

278
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,446
Come on, boys.
I wanna be home by sundown.

279
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:24,518
Hey, you think you can slow down
a little bit, please?

280
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:33,688
- Dibs.
- What?

281
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,299
I got dibs on the mountain guide.

282
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,667
- You're 13.
- Sorry, called it.

283
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,832
- Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs.
- Get over it.

284
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,617
We're getting closer.

285
00:19:56,954 --> 00:20:00,788
All right, just watch your step there.
Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous.

286
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,155
- What's Sneffels?
- Well, why don't you tell him, professor?

287
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:08,788
Sneffels is the name of the mountain
where this character Liedenbrock...

288
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:12,629
...apparently found a portal
to the center of the Earth.

289
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:15,328
Let's just find that sensor of yours,
professor.

290
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,474
There it is.

291
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:19,636
Yes.

292
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,005
Well, what do you need to do with it?

293
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,670
I gotta unlock it.
It's got, like, a black box...

294
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,414
...that has recorded
all of the seismic activity...

295
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:31,680
...that's transpired in the last 10 years.

296
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,255
Could tell me a lot about Max.

297
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:36,423
And what he was doing
when he went missing.

298
00:20:36,594 --> 00:20:39,085
Trevor, I'm really sorry,
we're gonna have to go now.

299
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:40,423
Must be corroded.

300
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,363
Trevor, we need to... Whoa.

301
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:50,903
Okay, we need to take cover.
Come on, Sean. Right now.

302
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:52,099
I'll be right there.

303
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:55,370
- Trevor, just leave it for now.
- I've almost got it.

304
00:20:56,146 --> 00:20:57,511
We need to take cover now.

305
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:01,580
Come on. Trevor.

306
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:03,583
- Uncle Trevor.
- Get in here.

307
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:07,853
- Yes. Oh!
- Watch out.

308
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:09,185
Hurry up. Come on.

309
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,291
Trevor,
the sensor's attracting the lightning.

310
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:16,456
- Drop it. Drop the sensor.
- What? I'm not gonna drop it.

311
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:19,967
Hurry!
- It's attracting the lightning!

312
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,279
Trevor?

313
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,620
- Trevor?
- I'm all right.

314
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,561
Sean?

315
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,431
- Sean, you all right?
- I'm good.

316
00:21:58,242 --> 00:22:03,202
- Okay, everybody, just stay calm.
- Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.

317
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,877
Come on.

318
00:22:11,922 --> 00:22:14,618
- Forget it, it's no use.
- Forget it?

319
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:18,654
She's right.

320
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:24,461
There must be about 60 or 70 tons
of boulders on top of us.

321
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,365
Take us about a month
to dig out of here.

322
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,608
- We have to find another way.
- What if there is no other way?

323
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:34,266
There's always another way, Sean.

324
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:37,171
What else have you got?

325
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:42,479
Signal flares, first aid, some rope, blankets
and a couple of protein bars.

326
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,745
But they're on a ration.

327
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:48,085
- Don't know how long we'll be trapped for.
- Trapped? Is that what we are?

328
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:52,321
She... No, she didn't mean that.

329
00:22:53,597 --> 00:22:56,930
- Sean, hey, what are you doing?
- God, I'm not getting any service.

330
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:59,728
Sean, you're not gonna get any signal
down here, okay?

331
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:02,497
Put this away.
Okay, don't worry about it.

332
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,836
- We'll find another way out, all right?
- Okay.

333
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:09,337
One of these
might snake back to the surface.

334
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,037
How do we know which one to take?

335
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,450
My gut says we go right.

336
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:16,017
Come on.

337
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,657
Looks promising.

338
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:31,959
Just put one foot in front of the other.
We'll be out of here in no time.

339
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:36,368
Looking good.

340
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:42,477
Don't worry, direction is my sixth sense.

341
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,014
Pay attention, Sean.
It's just like doing field work.

342
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:48,549
I used to love doing field work.

343
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,912
- Watch out.
- Ah!

344
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,433
You're not studying rocks in a lab,
professor.

345
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:11,062
- This is life or death here.
- Yeah, thanks.

346
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,268
You owe me one.

347
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:30,087
What does this say?

348
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,661
That means keep out.

349
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:38,029
- Maybe that's decent advice.
- No, no. This is great news.

350
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:41,569
This might lead us to an old mine shaft
and that could be our way out.

351
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:44,833
- How deep do you think it is?
- Can you give me one of those flares?

352
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:48,068
Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.

353
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,611
I'm gonna light this
and drop it over the edge...

354
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,841
...and I want you to tell me
how many seconds pass before it stops.

355
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:55,279
Okay.

356
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,753
Here we go. Three, two...

357
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,449
Oh, God!

358
00:25:10,768 --> 00:25:12,099
What?

359
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,032
What was that?

360
00:25:23,747 --> 00:25:25,647
Yup, magnesium.

361
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:28,151
Must run in veins
all through these walls.

362
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:31,685
Magnesium is kind of flammable,
isn't it, professor?

363
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:35,681
Yeah, used in flares,
used in gun powder, matchsticks.

364
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:40,523
Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares
aren't such a good idea down here.

365
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:45,465
Thank you.

366
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:46,864
It's the same principle.

367
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:51,274
- You ready, Sean?
- Yeah, go ahead.

368
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:53,966
Three, two...

369
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:56,812
One.

370
00:25:58,248 --> 00:25:59,272
Two.

371
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:02,209
Almost three.

372
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:05,218
Thirty-two squared by... It's 200 feet.

373
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:07,954
That's no problem.

374
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,720
It's about your basic 20-story high-rise.

375
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:14,227
- You got enough rope?
- I always have enough rope.

376
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,491
Well, no problem for what?

377
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:17,929
Rappelling down in there.

378
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:20,400
We're gonna rappel down
that deep, dark hole?

379
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:22,334
What, you got a problem with that?

380
00:26:22,506 --> 00:26:24,167
- Pfft.
- What's the matter?

381
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:26,536
There's no way
we should be rappelling down.

382
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,043
What are you talking about? You're
man enough to call dibs on the guide.

383
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,205
- But not enough to climb down a rope.
- Guys.

384
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:36,011
- Calling dibs on the mountain guide...
- No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.

385
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:38,880
We're going down there.

386
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:45,159
Steady, steady.

387
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:48,162
Remember, we're all connected.

388
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:51,025
It's okay.

389
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:54,630
Looking good.

390
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,508
It's all good down here.

391
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:00,867
Way down here.

392
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:02,511
You guys are coming down, right?

393
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,046
All right, Sean, I'm gonna start
lowering you down really, really slowly.

394
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:09,947
So just lean back
and keep your feet up high.

395
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:13,416
You're okay, Sean.

396
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,491
We're tethered together,
so nothing bad is gonna happen.

397
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:19,125
Yeah, sure.

398
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,496
Good.

399
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:27,126
Sean, keep walking.

400
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:29,499
You have to keep walking.

401
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:32,731
Good.

402
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,776
Hey, you're looking pretty good there.

403
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,074
- Sure you haven't done this before?
- Shut up.

404
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,315
Hey, you mind?
Watch your step, will you?

405
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:44,181
I'm hanging on for my life here.

406
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:47,923
Okay, Sean,
just make conversation with me.

407
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:51,592
So, Hannah, do you come here often?

408
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:53,121
Oh, give me a break.

409
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,822
That can't be the best line
you can come up with.

410
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:59,765
- I'm making conversation with her.
- No, Sean, I do not come here very often.

411
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,862
Ready?

412
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:11,471
Hey.

413
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:13,710
Look at all this schist.

414
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:15,579
- What?
- It's a metamorphic rock.

415
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:18,550
Green schist, garnet schist,
mica-garnet schist.

416
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:22,180
- Oh. Schist.
- It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...

417
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,128
Trevor.

418
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:34,794
Get to the wall, Trevor.
- I can't.

419
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:38,305
- I can't, the walls widen out down here.
- Your rope is caught on mine.

420
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:40,839
You're gonna take us down.
I gotta cut you loose.

421
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,137
What?
- Hannah, no.

422
00:28:42,312 --> 00:28:44,473
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

423
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:45,637
- Don't.
- Don't, don't, don't.

424
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:46,942
- Uncle Trevor.
- Ah!

425
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,217
Hey, guys, found it.

426
00:28:58,395 --> 00:28:59,828
The bottom's right here.

427
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,860
Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right?

428
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:06,000
Right?

429
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:07,631
Hannah?

430
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:19,740
Guys, what's this?

431
00:29:23,854 --> 00:29:25,845
Looks like
an abandoned mine tunnel to me.

432
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:28,583
That's Old Bla'gils Mine.

433
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:31,955
It was shut down 60 years ago
after the big disaster.

434
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:33,528
Disaster?

435
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,457
How big?

436
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:37,031
Eighty-one dead.

437
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,224
That's pretty big.

438
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:40,560
Come on.

439
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:42,901
Cowboy up.

440
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,070
Hey, Trevor,
was there a mine like this in the book?

441
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:49,937
No, don't think so.

442
00:29:51,782 --> 00:29:53,306
- Hannah?
- Yup?

443
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:55,474
Can I ask you something?

444
00:29:55,652 --> 00:30:02,148
Do you wonder if your father
and my brother weren't wrong?

445
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:05,826
Let me make something very clear
to you.

446
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:07,828
I am not my father.

447
00:30:08,465 --> 00:30:11,901
And the world that he belonged to
has nothing to do with me.

448
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:13,331
I understand, of course.

449
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:16,063
I didn't mean to say that it was
or that it would be...

450
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:19,970
- You know I'm still on the clock, right?
- You're still billing me?

451
00:30:20,143 --> 00:30:23,909
I bill you until I'm safe in my house.

452
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:28,382
- Huh.
- Hannah?

453
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:34,552
What's that?

454
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:37,850
- This is the old generator for the mine.
- Hey, you don't want to touch that.

455
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,362
What are you doing?

456
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:44,056
There might be some
volatile compounds there, you know.

457
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:47,169
- Serious generator.
- Hannah, that thing could blow up.

458
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:48,395
Stop throwing switches.

459
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:50,039
Don't do that. No, wait.

460
00:30:50,207 --> 00:30:51,697
Get away from that thing.

461
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:03,017
Okay, I take it back.

462
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:12,159
This is it, right? I mean, the miners,
they had to get their stuff out somewhere.

463
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:14,559
Yeah.
- These tracks could lead us out.

464
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:17,365
Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?

465
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:19,801
One.

466
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,568
That's a start. I call front.

467
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:24,404
What? No, no, no.

468
00:31:24,574 --> 00:31:25,871
Come on, don't get in there.

469
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:27,873
We don't even know
if these things work.

470
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:29,068
They're not safe.

471
00:31:29,246 --> 00:31:31,578
The tracks might not be safe.

472
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,352
Track ahead looks good. Get in.

473
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:51,924
Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe.
I wouldn't do that.

474
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:55,265
I think I see something. It's...

475
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,572
Please tell me it's daylight.
Otherwise, I don't wanna know.

476
00:31:59,142 --> 00:32:00,666
Uh...

477
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:03,608
No, it's not daylight.

478
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,010
Oh, we're in deep schist.

479
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,058
I wish there were seat belts
on this thing.

480
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,319
You're worried about seat belts?

481
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:30,163
- Whoa!
- Ah!

482
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,705
Watch it.

483
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:45,052
- Hannah.
- I know.

484
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:47,588
- Pull the brake, pull the brake.
- No, don't.

485
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,951
We won't make it.

486
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:02,134
Yeah.

487
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,798
Hey, great job. Thanks.

488
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:10,108
Guys.
- Stay put, Sean.

489
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,115
Trevor, you okay?

490
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:26,092
Hannah, your track ends.

491
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:28,687
Jump in my car.

492
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,393
What?

493
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,694
Quick, you have to do it.

494
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:34,860
- Just jump.
- I know that.

495
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,203
Ready? Ah!

496
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:47,180
Trevor, your track ends too.

497
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:53,946
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

498
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,949
Showing the proper way
to save someone's life. Come on.

499
00:33:57,127 --> 00:33:58,321
- Can I help?
- Okay.

500
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,322
Ready?

501
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:21,076
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

502
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:23,549
Luckily, I had a soft landing.

503
00:34:27,057 --> 00:34:29,457
That's two you owe me now.

504
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:33,056
- Who's keeping count?
- I am.

505
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,430
That was awesome.

506
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:45,434
- What happened to you guys?
- Don't ask.

507
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,272
What's that?

508
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,951
Where are you going? Don't go in there.

509
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,816
What are you guys talking about?
This could be our way out.

510
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:04,186
There's a hole in the wall.

511
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:06,261
Guys, check it out.

512
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,000
Rubies.

513
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:13,897
Emeralds.

514
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,662
Feldspar.

515
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:19,567
Uh, guys, there's more.

516
00:35:32,655 --> 00:35:34,282
Diamonds.

517
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:36,582
Bling.

518
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:45,064
Crystals are frequently formed
and found...

519
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:50,167
...in volcanic tubes.

520
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:59,344
This tube could take us back up, right?

521
00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:01,575
- Uh-huh.
- We're not far from the surface.

522
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:04,447
- Uh-uh.
- When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.

523
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:08,853
Money is not the only thing that matters,
Sean. People matter too, you know.

524
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:12,461
- Something like that.
- Not if you have a Maserati.

525
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:16,727
Did you guys hear that?

526
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,865
Nobody move.

527
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:34,280
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

528
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:38,945
Muscovite.

529
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,346
Muscovite.

530
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:42,457
What's muscovite?

531
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:48,522
- Muscovite is a thin type of rock formation.
- How thin?

532
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:52,395
Well, so thin that the slightest change
in weight and pressure...

533
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:55,231
...can cause it to shatter.

534
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,663
And we're standing on a lot of it.

535
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:00,333
Just stop. Stop.

536
00:37:04,214 --> 00:37:05,238
Okay, they're stopped.

537
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,375
I need you to walk back
exactly the way we came from.

538
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:10,746
Very, very calmly, okay?

539
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,248
Tread lightly.

540
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:15,414
Heel, toe. Doing good.

541
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:17,958
Doing great. Very slowly.

542
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:20,186
Good. Come on.

543
00:37:25,969 --> 00:37:27,163
That's it.

544
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:29,731
That's great.

545
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:31,203
- Really careful.
- Keep going.

546
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:34,703
No!

547
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,287
It's actually thicker than I thought.

548
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:07,702
We're still falling!

549
00:38:20,323 --> 00:38:21,790
Trevor, what's at the bottom?

550
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,789
Well, if what Verne wrote was right...

551
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,656
...these tunnels could go for hundreds,
thousands of miles.

552
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:28,126
Verne was not right.

553
00:38:28,298 --> 00:38:30,129
Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?

554
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,325
Most likely theory is that it just ends.

555
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:35,835
Ends? Got any other theories?

556
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:38,997
Well, the walls of this tunnel
could have gently eroded...

557
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:41,143
...by water which still runs through it...

558
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:44,405
...providing a gradual break to our fall.

559
00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:47,482
- Kind of like a water slide.
- Water slide.

560
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,049
Okay, that's a theory.

561
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:53,348
But wouldn't the water have formed
stalagmites pointing straight up at us?

562
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:55,821
- We'll be skewered.
- That is also possible.

563
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:13,708
Is that water?

564
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:15,275
Yes. Water.

565
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,140
Water slide, water slide.

566
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,611
Here it comes. Hang on.

567
00:39:58,488 --> 00:40:00,547
Sean! Sean!

568
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:03,491
Sean, Sean, you all right?

569
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,457
We didn't get skewered.

570
00:40:05,628 --> 00:40:07,562
Make for the rocks.

571
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:18,205
Where's Hannah?

572
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,434
Hannah! Hannah!

573
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,617
My backpack was too heavy.

574
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,775
Thank you.

575
00:40:59,348 --> 00:41:01,213
So where does that put us now?

576
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:06,445
Back to one.

577
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:11,994
Guys, where are we?

578
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:13,389
Are those stars?

579
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,398
No.

580
00:41:22,572 --> 00:41:25,302
That's just the ceiling of the cave.

581
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:29,002
Is it just me, or is the cave ceiling...

582
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:31,571
...moving?

583
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,244
Yeah.

584
00:41:35,718 --> 00:41:37,913
It does look like it...

585
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:39,520
...doesn't it?

586
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,143
They're birds.

587
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:07,944
Electric birds?

588
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:10,677
They look like <i>Cyanis rosopteryx.</i>

589
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:15,153
Only they're bioluminescent,
like fireflies or glowworms.

590
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,348
It's incredible.

591
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:29,531
Cool.

592
00:42:29,705 --> 00:42:31,969
Glow... birds.

593
00:42:42,285 --> 00:42:43,718
Have you seen
these creatures before?

594
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:45,979
Yeah, in the museum,
but they were fossilized.

595
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:49,386
These things have been extinct
for over 150 million years.

596
00:43:02,004 --> 00:43:04,234
Where are they going?
- Hey, a tunnel.

597
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,937
Guys, come on.

598
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:10,776
Sean, wait. Wait for me.

599
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:42,702
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the center of the Earth.

600
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:48,240
Max was right.

601
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,853
He was right.

602
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:55,983
Max was right!

603
00:43:58,628 --> 00:43:59,959
Your dad was right.

604
00:44:00,463 --> 00:44:01,487
He was right.

605
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,331
Hannah, your dad was right too.

606
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:06,796
They both believed...

607
00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:10,427
...in something
that everyone told them was impossible.

608
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,597
He was right.

609
00:44:14,911 --> 00:44:18,074
- What's that light up there?
- I can't tell.

610
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:24,152
It must be some sort
of luminescent gas combination.

611
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,449
I don't know.

612
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,420
It's like a terrarium.

613
00:44:29,592 --> 00:44:32,823
A terrarium thousands of miles
beneath the crust of the Earth.

614
00:44:35,531 --> 00:44:40,093
A world within the world.

615
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:57,017
"The waterfalls, which for a long time,
could be heard flowing from afar...

616
00:44:57,186 --> 00:45:00,883
...now cascaded along
the towering canyon walls...

617
00:45:01,057 --> 00:45:03,491
...streaming along the rock
with no end."

618
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,291
I mean,
it's the same thing Liedenbrock wrote.

619
00:45:06,462 --> 00:45:10,489
Are we saying that Liedenbrock
the character was real?

620
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,826
That he existed?

621
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,528
Someone came down here.
Someone saw all this.

622
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:18,572
Someone got out
and someone told Verne.

623
00:45:18,741 --> 00:45:20,504
Somebody got out?

624
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,735
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

625
00:45:22,912 --> 00:45:25,005
Doesn't this
just completely blow your mind?

626
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:50,664
My mind is blown, yes.

627
00:45:59,682 --> 00:46:02,742
Enormous fossilized mushrooms.

628
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:05,682
Sort of like humongous fungus.

629
00:46:08,858 --> 00:46:11,418
- Everything in the book is real?
- Probably.

630
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:14,529
- And the really dangerous parts?
- I was thinking about that too.

631
00:46:14,697 --> 00:46:15,994
Right.

632
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:18,657
Trevor, come quick.

633
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:20,131
- Sean?
- Sean?

634
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,594
- I'm going in.
- Yeah, wait up.

635
00:46:47,396 --> 00:46:49,125
Hey, slow down.

636
00:46:49,865 --> 00:46:50,957
I'll be right there.

637
00:47:16,992 --> 00:47:19,222
Someone actually lived here?

638
00:47:19,395 --> 00:47:21,329
That somebody...

639
00:47:22,898 --> 00:47:24,889
...was Liedenbrock.

640
00:47:27,036 --> 00:47:28,901
Look at all his gear.

641
00:47:29,538 --> 00:47:31,802
All this, state of the art...

642
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:34,432
...a century ago.

643
00:48:33,135 --> 00:48:34,796
Hey, Trevor.

644
00:48:35,337 --> 00:48:37,168
I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.

645
00:48:40,075 --> 00:48:41,633
Look.

646
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:45,769
Looks like on the other side of those trees
there's some sort of underground ocean.

647
00:48:45,948 --> 00:48:47,506
Yeah.

648
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,883
I don't think
that's Liedenbrock's handwriting.

649
00:48:57,259 --> 00:48:59,193
It's my dad's.

650
00:49:00,796 --> 00:49:02,388
Trevor?

651
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,299
Trevor?

652
00:49:09,205 --> 00:49:11,105
Can I talk to you for a minute?

653
00:49:11,273 --> 00:49:12,297
Out here.

654
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:14,874
Can you wait here for a minute?

655
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:33,527
Hey, I think I found Max.

656
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:15,202
I never really got a chance to know him.

657
00:50:17,706 --> 00:50:21,198
I mean, I wish I did.

658
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:25,479
He wrote something
and I want you to hear it.

659
00:50:28,217 --> 00:50:32,415
"August 14, 1997.

660
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:35,314
Today was Sean's third birthday.

661
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,293
Six weeks ago, I promised myself
I would be home in time...

662
00:50:41,463 --> 00:50:43,397
...to give him his first baseball glove.

663
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,427
Now I'm worried...

664
00:50:49,204 --> 00:50:51,536
...that I'll never get the chance.

665
00:50:55,778 --> 00:51:01,910
I set out to make an incredible discovery
to share with Trevor and the world.

666
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:06,052
But now, I would trade it all...

667
00:51:07,156 --> 00:51:09,784
...just to be able to watch you grow up...

668
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:13,917
...to be the brave and caring man...

669
00:51:14,096 --> 00:51:17,156
...I am certain you will become.

670
00:51:21,403 --> 00:51:22,768
Happy birthday, Sean.

671
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,534
I love you.

672
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,574
Daddy."

673
00:51:43,759 --> 00:51:45,727
Goodbye, Max.

674
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,236
Come on.

675
00:52:17,993 --> 00:52:19,722
According to Max's journal...

676
00:52:19,895 --> 00:52:25,356
...we're here in this giant air pocket
that's surrounded by lava.

677
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:29,163
And during periods
of intense seismic activity...

678
00:52:31,874 --> 00:52:35,037
- Like the one we're in now.
- That's right.

679
00:52:35,577 --> 00:52:37,636
- the magma that surrounds us...

680
00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:40,976
...turns this place
into pretty much just a big oven.

681
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,380
Was that what happened to my dad?

682
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:52,955
Look, I know I'm just a kid,
but I can handle this, really.

683
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,959
Sit down.

684
00:52:56,899 --> 00:52:58,594
Max was planning an escape.

685
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:03,431
His notes say that temperatures down here
can easily hit 200 degrees.

686
00:53:03,605 --> 00:53:06,005
A human being can't survive
beyond 135.

687
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,666
- It's already 95 degrees.
- It was 82 when we got here.

688
00:53:08,844 --> 00:53:11,176
- Temperature's rising quickly.
- So, what do we do?

689
00:53:11,346 --> 00:53:13,280
I say that we follow Max's plan.

690
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,141
"My analysis of the original Verne text...

691
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,779
...leads me to believe that across the ocean
due north of my current position...

692
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:25,484
...is a geyser-like river which could be used
to return to the surface."

693
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:28,061
So, what we have to do
is get across this ocean...

694
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:32,291
...and find the geyser
and just hitch a ride topside.

695
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:33,662
Topside sounds good.

696
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,360
It's a little trickier than that.

697
00:53:35,537 --> 00:53:37,732
It could get so hot
that the water'll evaporate.

698
00:53:37,906 --> 00:53:39,601
How much time do we have?

699
00:53:39,775 --> 00:53:41,868
Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two, tops.

700
00:53:43,312 --> 00:53:44,643
Probably less.

701
00:53:44,813 --> 00:53:46,906
Okay, so the question is:

702
00:53:47,082 --> 00:53:49,448
What is the fastest way
to get across the ocean?

703
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:52,246
There's no way we can get around it,
because if we hike...

704
00:53:52,421 --> 00:53:53,683
Oh, we don't have time.

705
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,915
There's no time to do that.

706
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,720
It's all in the book.

707
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:08,502
Hey, you all right?

708
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,331
What's the temperature doing?

709
00:54:10,506 --> 00:54:12,167
It is a hundred degrees.

710
00:54:20,015 --> 00:54:23,576
Eat your trilobite, Sean.
We gotta keep our strength up.

711
00:54:24,486 --> 00:54:25,714
Attaboy.

712
00:54:30,592 --> 00:54:31,957
Hey.

713
00:54:32,127 --> 00:54:34,595
Don't we need a center mast?

714
00:54:34,763 --> 00:54:36,628
No. We don't need it.

715
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:38,959
The wind that we want is way up there.

716
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:42,535
Thermal. It's a lot faster
than what we got down here.

717
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,573
Good job. That should just about do it.

718
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,905
Hey, I got something for you.

719
00:54:56,018 --> 00:54:58,452
What is this?
- It's a compass.

720
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,746
It was your dad's.

721
00:55:00,722 --> 00:55:03,350
I remember the Christmas
that your mom gave it to him.

722
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:08,929
She wanted to make sure
that he could always find a way back home.

723
00:55:10,165 --> 00:55:14,261
And maybe it will help you
find a way back to her.

724
00:55:19,908 --> 00:55:21,671
- Thanks, Trevor.
- You got it.

725
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:23,674
- It means a lot to me.
- Me too.

726
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:30,051
Oh, there's one thing you should know.
Down here, the polarity is reversed.

727
00:55:30,218 --> 00:55:32,186
I mean, north is south, south is north...

728
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:35,585
...and we need to bear due north
across the sea.

729
00:55:36,024 --> 00:55:37,457
You mean, south.

730
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,588
Exactly.

731
00:56:02,217 --> 00:56:04,185
All right, it's starting to pick up now.

732
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:07,455
Okay, hold it. Hold it really steady.

733
00:56:07,623 --> 00:56:09,853
Good, good, good.

734
00:56:10,258 --> 00:56:12,317
- Good. Ready?
- Yeah.

735
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,325
Three, two, one, go!

736
00:56:16,898 --> 00:56:18,024
- Yeah.
- All right.

737
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,226
Yeah. All right.

738
00:56:25,073 --> 00:56:26,768
Yeah.

739
00:56:28,043 --> 00:56:29,408
Go, go, go.

740
00:56:30,979 --> 00:56:32,742
Yeah. Keep going.

741
00:56:40,322 --> 00:56:42,347
Whoa, we're going, we're going.

742
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,991
Hey, well, can you wait for me?

743
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:47,094
Well, get on.
- Come on, come on, let's go.

744
00:57:03,278 --> 00:57:04,836
He's back.

745
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:06,913
Hey, little guy.

746
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,147
Seen those clouds?

747
00:57:14,322 --> 00:57:15,687
Yeah.

748
00:57:15,857 --> 00:57:20,123
The current's pulling us in the direction
we wanna go. We should lower the kite.

749
00:57:22,264 --> 00:57:24,698
Can't do that.
It's a hundred and nine degrees.

750
00:57:24,866 --> 00:57:25,890
It's getting hotter.

751
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,229
We need all the speed we can get.
Leave it up.

752
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:36,466
It's just a little storm.

753
00:57:36,645 --> 00:57:39,113
Ain't no big deal.

754
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,144
Something moving down there.

755
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,021
Phosphorous and plankton.

756
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:52,251
It's the same thing we saw
back at the beach.

757
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,622
I don't know.
It looks kind of big for plankton.

758
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:57,731
Sean, we're not at SeaWorld,
so back off a little bit.

759
00:57:57,899 --> 00:58:00,163
- All right?
- I think it's some sort of fish.

760
00:58:11,313 --> 00:58:12,610
No.

761
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:19,879
They're everywhere.

762
00:58:20,055 --> 00:58:22,148
Sean, I told you
we'd get to the batting cage.

763
00:58:22,324 --> 00:58:23,655
Batter up.

764
00:58:24,426 --> 00:58:26,690
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

765
00:58:28,363 --> 00:58:30,763
Yeah. Line drive.

766
00:58:36,271 --> 00:58:37,363
- Sean!
- Do you hear something?

767
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:41,835
- Hello?
- <i>Sean.</i>

768
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,841
- Mom?
- <i>I think we have a bad connection.</i>

769
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:45,673
Mom, I can't hear you.

770
00:58:45,847 --> 00:58:47,314
<i>Where are you?</i>

771
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,815
Uncle Trevor and I, uh...

772
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,511
...we're sort of on a fishing trip and...

773
00:58:54,723 --> 00:58:56,054
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

774
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,192
Whoa, no, you don't.

775
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:03,729
- Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one.
- <i>Sean?</i>

776
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:06,895
- My phone.
- Sean, do you know how to switch hit?

777
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,500
- Ready?
- Yeah.

778
00:59:11,573 --> 00:59:12,733
Out of the ball park.

779
00:59:12,908 --> 00:59:14,000
- Sean.
- Look out.

780
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,234
I got it, I got it.

781
00:59:22,584 --> 00:59:23,812
Sean.
- No, no, don't.

782
00:59:23,985 --> 00:59:25,919
Get away from the sides.

783
00:59:30,926 --> 00:59:32,052
Look what they're doing.

784
00:59:32,594 --> 00:59:34,425
They don't want us. They want the fish.

785
00:59:34,596 --> 00:59:37,895
Listen up.
Sean, you take the tiller, we'll get the line.

786
00:59:38,066 --> 00:59:39,465
Hannah, hold the slack.

787
00:59:39,634 --> 00:59:41,499
Sean, you wanna take us hard starboard?

788
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,137
What?

789
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:44,397
That way.

790
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:49,877
Come on.

791
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,742
- Okay.
- Doing good.

792
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,650
Now just let it out gently.
Let it out gently.

793
00:59:57,819 --> 00:59:58,979
Let it out slowly.

794
00:59:59,154 --> 01:00:00,519
It's working.

795
01:00:00,689 --> 01:00:03,214
We're pulling clear of them.

796
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,360
You're the man, Uncle Trev.

797
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:13,399
That's what I've been telling
the scientific community for years.

798
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,203
Hannah.

799
01:00:19,374 --> 01:00:20,932
Let me see.

800
01:00:25,981 --> 01:00:27,278
The lines.

801
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:45,889
Got it.
- Sean.

802
01:00:46,067 --> 01:00:48,092
Sean, don't do that. No, Sean.

803
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,396
Sean!

804
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:53,073
- No, Sean!
- Trevor!

805
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:55,573
- Sean!
- Hang on!

806
01:00:55,744 --> 01:00:59,202
Don't let go!

807
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,549
No.

808
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,080
Trevor?

809
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,780
Trevor?

810
01:02:16,825 --> 01:02:18,588
Hello?

811
01:02:21,329 --> 01:02:22,990
Hello?

812
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,361
Hey, little guy. Where are we?

813
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,736
Hey, do you know
where I can get some water?

814
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,871
I'm talking to a bird.

815
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,172
I must be losing it.

816
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,250
Sean!

817
01:02:56,598 --> 01:02:59,158
Sean!

818
01:03:02,871 --> 01:03:04,634
Wait.

819
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,776
The wind blew him this way.

820
01:03:11,946 --> 01:03:14,176
We still heading north?

821
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,208
Yeah, still north.

822
01:03:17,385 --> 01:03:19,353
He's a smart kid. He knows the plan.

823
01:03:19,521 --> 01:03:22,081
I'm sure he'll be waiting by the river.

824
01:03:23,124 --> 01:03:24,921
Let's find that river.

825
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,264
Hey, come on, wait up.

826
01:03:39,674 --> 01:03:41,608
Where'd you go?

827
01:03:48,316 --> 01:03:50,375
Good job.

828
01:03:55,824 --> 01:03:57,587
Okay.

829
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,818
Now which way?

830
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:07,930
South.

831
01:04:08,103 --> 01:04:09,297
That's good.

832
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,371
The river's north.

833
01:04:12,273 --> 01:04:13,638
Okay.

834
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:18,378
Here, let me take that.

835
01:04:18,546 --> 01:04:20,537
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Come on, let me take it.

836
01:04:20,715 --> 01:04:22,774
- Trevor, I'm fine.
- Hannah, Hannah, I got it.

837
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,846
Let's just stop for a second.

838
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:35,490
Hey, we're gonna find him.

839
01:04:40,702 --> 01:04:41,896
Drink that.

840
01:04:43,037 --> 01:04:45,301
- Is that the last of the water?
- Yeah.

841
01:04:45,473 --> 01:04:46,940
We're gonna need that. Keep it.

842
01:04:47,108 --> 01:04:49,167
Hannah, drink it.

843
01:04:51,312 --> 01:04:52,939
Come on.

844
01:05:03,925 --> 01:05:05,358
Duck!

845
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,686
- What the...?
- What was that?

846
01:05:12,267 --> 01:05:14,701
Large carnivorous plant?

847
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,530
Hannah.

848
01:05:17,305 --> 01:05:18,897
Hannah?

849
01:05:19,307 --> 01:05:20,934
Hannah.

850
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,400
Hannah.

851
01:05:27,015 --> 01:05:28,642
Hannah.

852
01:05:36,524 --> 01:05:37,513
Ugh.

853
01:05:50,271 --> 01:05:52,034
Hang in there.

854
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,704
That's one point for me, right?

855
01:06:00,882 --> 01:06:02,110
Right.

856
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:05,548
Who's keeping track, right?

857
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,760
I get it.

858
01:06:50,932 --> 01:06:53,059
It's a magnetic field.

859
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:19,792
No way.

860
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:22,122
Magnetic rocks?

861
01:08:58,559 --> 01:09:01,756
No, no. No, no, no.

862
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,443
No. No.

863
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:51,234
You try that without wings.

864
01:10:05,193 --> 01:10:06,558
That's the river.

865
01:10:06,727 --> 01:10:09,389
Geyser must be inside that cave.

866
01:10:11,065 --> 01:10:15,593
Sean!

867
01:10:25,213 --> 01:10:26,578
Where is he?

868
01:10:26,981 --> 01:10:29,245
Where is he?

869
01:10:46,234 --> 01:10:48,099
Trevor?

870
01:10:52,573 --> 01:10:53,597
Trevor?

871
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:21,965
Man, I really wish I'd read that book.

872
01:11:54,702 --> 01:11:56,260
I don't see him anywhere.

873
01:12:05,713 --> 01:12:07,408
Trevor? Trevor.

874
01:12:07,582 --> 01:12:09,345
Hang on a minute. What are you doing?

875
01:12:09,684 --> 01:12:11,584
I'm going to get my nephew.

876
01:12:13,487 --> 01:12:15,011
Hannah.

877
01:12:15,523 --> 01:12:19,857
This is all my fault.

878
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:22,089
Save yourself.

879
01:12:22,663 --> 01:12:24,460
Just go home.

880
01:12:25,232 --> 01:12:27,666
I'll wait for you at the river...

881
01:12:27,835 --> 01:12:30,326
...for as long as I can.

882
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:38,843
What did you do that for?

883
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,110
Just in case.

884
01:13:53,954 --> 01:13:56,422
Sean!

885
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:58,785
Sean!

886
01:14:17,478 --> 01:14:19,343
Sean!

887
01:14:20,881 --> 01:14:22,542
Sean?!

888
01:14:23,884 --> 01:14:25,442
Sean!

889
01:14:27,988 --> 01:14:29,319
Sean!

890
01:14:31,659 --> 01:14:33,286
Sean! Sean!

891
01:14:54,982 --> 01:14:56,415
Come on!

892
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:01,552
Oh, God, I'm glad to see you.

893
01:15:01,722 --> 01:15:02,746
Yeah, you too.

894
01:15:02,923 --> 01:15:05,016
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

895
01:15:05,192 --> 01:15:06,386
We should go.

896
01:15:07,762 --> 01:15:09,093
Wait, wait, wait.

897
01:15:09,263 --> 01:15:12,232
- Is that the geyser?
- Yeah, that's where we're going.

898
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:15,796
Come on.

899
01:15:17,037 --> 01:15:20,632
- Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?
- Not with skin on it.

900
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,548
He's too fast. We're not gonna make it.

901
01:15:34,522 --> 01:15:36,752
- Trevor, what are you doing?
- That's muscovite.

902
01:15:36,924 --> 01:15:39,017
Same thing that we fell through before.

903
01:15:39,193 --> 01:15:41,024
There's no way it's gonna hold you.

904
01:15:41,195 --> 01:15:43,493
It can't hold him either. Now you run.

905
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,632
Trevor, no.

906
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,496
It's not breaking, Trevor.

907
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:52,662
Keep running!

908
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:57,643
- He's gaining on you.
- I know.

909
01:15:57,812 --> 01:15:59,871
Keep going.

910
01:16:00,915 --> 01:16:02,815
Ah! Whoa.

911
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,615
Trevor, it's working.

912
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,660
Look out!

913
01:16:24,972 --> 01:16:26,405
Trevor!

914
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,546
I just remembered something.
I hate field work.

915
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:37,877
Trevor, come on.

916
01:16:41,288 --> 01:16:43,188
That was like... And then you were like...

917
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:45,587
Yeah, I know. I'm really lucky.

918
01:16:45,759 --> 01:16:47,454
Okay, that way.

919
01:16:47,628 --> 01:16:51,086
That, no good. That, worse.

920
01:16:51,265 --> 01:16:52,892
Let's go.

921
01:17:00,374 --> 01:17:03,275
The river.
How are we gonna get to the geyser?

922
01:17:03,444 --> 01:17:05,708
- Water's boiling.
- We need something that floats.

923
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,472
Anything. I could use a log or...

924
01:17:07,648 --> 01:17:09,843
What we really need is a boat.

925
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:23,790
Who had dibs again?

926
01:17:26,967 --> 01:17:27,991
Come on, jump in.

927
01:17:28,168 --> 01:17:31,331
- The best mountain guide on the planet.
- Got that right.

928
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,933
You didn't really think
you were gonna scare me away, did you?

929
01:17:37,411 --> 01:17:39,743
You'll have to work harder than that.

930
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:52,481
I'm afraid I'll have to charge you extra
for this bit.

931
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,855
Can I open a tab? Whoa.

932
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:57,988
What was that?

933
01:17:58,732 --> 01:18:01,496
It's not good. That's the river bed.

934
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:03,466
We're running out of water.

935
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:07,337
Well, guys,
you might wanna hang on to something.

936
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:10,807
This ride is about to get a little bit...

937
01:18:19,086 --> 01:18:20,781
Bumpy.

938
01:18:24,224 --> 01:18:25,885
- Is everybody all right?
- Yeah.

939
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:27,960
Where are we?

940
01:18:29,763 --> 01:18:31,924
What's that light down there?

941
01:18:32,232 --> 01:18:33,699
That's lava.

942
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,868
It's magma, and it's rising.

943
01:18:37,037 --> 01:18:40,268
There's supposed to be water in this tunnel.
Steam, water shooting up.

944
01:18:40,441 --> 01:18:42,739
We're too late for the geyser,
we missed it.

945
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:45,504
- What do we do?
- Do you have any suggestions, professor?

946
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,705
Without water, no steam.
Without steam, we're not going anywhere.

947
01:18:48,882 --> 01:18:52,477
This place looks like there hasn't been
water here in two, three hours now.

948
01:18:52,653 --> 01:18:55,713
- But the walls are still wet.
- That's impossible, it's 130 degrees.

949
01:18:55,889 --> 01:18:57,322
- Trevor. Behind you.
- What?

950
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:01,719
It is wet.

951
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,721
It's cold. There's water behind here.

952
01:19:04,898 --> 01:19:07,799
There's gotta be water behind some pocket
or underground river.

953
01:19:07,968 --> 01:19:09,265
Trevor, it's getting closer.

954
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,062
Hey, that's magnesium.

955
01:19:16,343 --> 01:19:18,504
- We're slipping.
- How many flares you got left?

956
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,446
Three.
What do you wanna do with them?

957
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:27,450
Gonna light the magnesium. On purpose.

958
01:19:29,423 --> 01:19:31,015
Hang on.

959
01:19:35,129 --> 01:19:37,393
Oh, come on. It's too wet.

960
01:19:41,935 --> 01:19:44,233
Got to get further down.
Give me another one.

961
01:19:46,206 --> 01:19:47,969
Hold my legs.

962
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,304
Come on.

963
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:01,986
You're gonna have to tie me off.
I gotta get down lower.

964
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,685
Trevor, it's getting closer.

965
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,954
That's good. All right, ready.

966
01:20:10,731 --> 01:20:12,426
It's the last one.

967
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:30,349
Trevor, be careful.

968
01:20:33,921 --> 01:20:35,479
How's that?
- Little more.

969
01:20:35,656 --> 01:20:37,180
Hurry.

970
01:20:40,928 --> 01:20:43,123
Lower?
- Little more.

971
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:44,924
Okay, hold off.

972
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,261
- Come on.
- Come on.

973
01:20:48,435 --> 01:20:50,426
Come on, light.
- Come on.

974
01:20:52,339 --> 01:20:53,363
Come on, Trevor.

975
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,906
Still wet. Gonna have to
throw it to the other side.

976
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:16,595
What?

977
01:21:17,064 --> 01:21:18,156
No.

978
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:19,890
No!

979
01:21:25,405 --> 01:21:27,134
Trevor, come on.

980
01:21:27,608 --> 01:21:29,405
- Trevor, come on.
- It's lit, it's lit.

981
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:30,804
Pull!

982
01:21:31,145 --> 01:21:32,373
- Pull me up.
- Hurry.

983
01:21:32,546 --> 01:21:33,706
Pull me up. Pull me up.

984
01:21:35,115 --> 01:21:36,844
Come on, pull it. Pull it.
- Pull.

985
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:39,679
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.

986
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:41,844
Sean! Come on!

987
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,250
Get down, it's gonna blow.

988
01:21:55,836 --> 01:21:57,064
This thing's heating up.

989
01:21:57,237 --> 01:21:58,829
I know!

990
01:22:07,114 --> 01:22:10,083
- Hang on!
- Trust me, I'm hanging on!

991
01:22:12,286 --> 01:22:14,550
Is that sky?

992
01:22:28,101 --> 01:22:29,966
Hang on, everybody!

993
01:22:30,137 --> 01:22:32,537
- Stop saying that!
- It just keeps coming up!

994
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:24,590
That's Mount Vesuvius.

995
01:23:25,058 --> 01:23:28,494
Hey, Sean, if your mom asks you
what you did this weekend...

996
01:23:28,662 --> 01:23:32,655
...you tell her Uncle Trevor took you to Italy.
- Italy?

997
01:23:50,717 --> 01:23:51,809
Sean?

998
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,009
Sean?

999
01:23:55,255 --> 01:23:57,314
What? I just took
a few geological samples.

1000
01:23:57,491 --> 01:23:59,049
A few geological samples?

1001
01:23:59,226 --> 01:24:02,684
A few pounds of samples, but what
do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.

1002
01:24:05,032 --> 01:24:07,159
Look. Look.

1003
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,859
You take this.

1004
01:24:10,037 --> 01:24:13,200
You take. We are sorry.

1005
01:24:19,446 --> 01:24:22,313
You want slide again?

1006
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,979
Slide is okay. It's fine.

1007
01:24:25,152 --> 01:24:27,416
Anything what you want.

1008
01:24:36,563 --> 01:24:38,190
What was that for?

1009
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,390
Now we're even.

1010
01:24:53,914 --> 01:24:56,781
Leonard, I'm back.
Stop doing what you're doing.

1011
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:58,884
What am I doing?

1012
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:00,849
Oh, look, you're looking for work.

1013
01:25:01,021 --> 01:25:03,216
You don't need to,
because you have a job...

1014
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:07,019
...with the Ásgeirsson-Anderson Institute
for Tectonophysical Exploration.

1015
01:25:07,194 --> 01:25:09,526
The Ásgeirsson-Anderson... What?

1016
01:25:09,696 --> 01:25:11,186
Still working on the name.

1017
01:25:11,365 --> 01:25:13,799
But the point is, rising tide lifts all boats.

1018
01:25:13,967 --> 01:25:15,594
Man, that's awesome.

1019
01:25:15,769 --> 01:25:17,930
I think... Am I a boat?

1020
01:25:18,105 --> 01:25:21,006
- You're a boat. We're back in business.
- All right, dude.

1021
01:25:21,174 --> 01:25:23,699
Well, well, well.
What's all the excitement about?

1022
01:25:23,877 --> 01:25:25,538
- Oh, hey, Alan. How are you?
- Good.

1023
01:25:25,712 --> 01:25:27,304
- What you doing?
- Oh, me?

1024
01:25:27,481 --> 01:25:29,972
I'm moving into my new lab.

1025
01:25:30,350 --> 01:25:32,113
More importantly, where have you been?

1026
01:25:32,285 --> 01:25:36,119
I heard you missed your Monday lecture
and both of your students complained.

1027
01:25:36,289 --> 01:25:37,278
Oh!

1028
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:41,025
I took a quick vacation.
Best thing I could've done.

1029
01:25:41,194 --> 01:25:42,252
That is exciting.

1030
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,693
You'll have to promise
to tell me about it, okay?

1031
01:25:44,865 --> 01:25:49,029
Not sure if I'll have time, but you can read
about it in <i>Scientific American.</i>

1032
01:25:51,571 --> 01:25:52,663
<i>Scientific American?</i>

1033
01:25:52,839 --> 01:25:55,364
Look, I just want to say,
no hard feelings, okay?

1034
01:25:55,542 --> 01:25:57,908
About the laboratory moving
and expansion thing.

1035
01:25:58,078 --> 01:26:00,569
So I'm actually looking
for my own building anyway.

1036
01:26:00,747 --> 01:26:03,580
How exactly
are you going to do that, Trevor?

1037
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,817
Well, let's just say
I fell into a small fortune.

1038
01:26:09,556 --> 01:26:11,581
So tomorrow
you're gonna be a Canadian.

1039
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:14,056
Yep. Looks that way.

1040
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,829
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding
packed into very little time.

1041
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:26,370
What do you say
we take a couple weeks next time?

1042
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,007
A couple weeks?

1043
01:26:28,175 --> 01:26:30,643
- What are you doing over Christmas break?
- Nothing. I'm free.

1044
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,938
I just found this in your dad's stuff.

1045
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:34,974
Give it a read.

1046
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,139
- <i>"Lost City of Atlantis."</i>
- Mm-hm.

1047
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,875
We'll talk.

1048
01:26:41,955 --> 01:26:43,047
Sean, what is that?

1049
01:26:43,757 --> 01:26:45,850
- I'm just feeding my pet.
- What pet?

1050
01:26:46,026 --> 01:26:47,994
Sean.

1051
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:50,786
- You think my mom will let me keep him?
- I don't know.

1052
01:26:50,964 --> 01:26:53,057
Might not even stay here.

1053
01:26:53,233 --> 01:26:55,030
- Look at it.
- Hey, come on.

1054
01:26:55,202 --> 01:26:57,397
- This is your problem.
- Where are you going?

1055
01:26:57,871 --> 01:27:00,007
I got some food for you. Come on.
Come back down here.

1056
01:27:00,874 --> 01:27:02,466
Come on.

1057
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,552
