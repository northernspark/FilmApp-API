2
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:54,799
Don't worry. It's just a pack of wolves.
Come on. We're almost rid of it.

3
00:01:12,885 --> 00:01:15,513
- Caleb, it's after me!
- Grab on!

4
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:18,216
Run! Run!

5
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,886
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.
Come on. Help me bury it.

6
00:01:26,198 --> 00:01:28,894
What if someone digs it up?

7
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,237
May God have mercy
on his soul.

8
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:09,732
- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Miss Magruder.

9
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:12,174
- Good afternoon, Alan.
- Hey, Frank.

10
00:02:19,952 --> 00:02:22,750
- All yours, Alan.
- Thanks, Bill.

11
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:39,933
Get him!

12
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,574
Prepare to die, Parrish!

13
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,482
Hey, Parrish,
what's the rush?

14
00:02:58,457 --> 00:03:00,152
He's goin' to
his dad's factory!

15
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:05,091
Alan wants his daddy now!

16
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:21,773
Go ahead, Parrish.
Run to Daddy. We'll be waiting.

17
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:46,498
- Hi, Carl.
- Hey, Alan, I gotta show you something.

18
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:50,099
Come here. Now, I've been
working on this for almost a year.

19
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:54,805
I got an appointment this afternoon
with your father to show him this.

20
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,610
Go ahead. Take it.

21
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:59,844
So what do ya think?
Ya think he'II like it?

22
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,188
- What is it?
- What is it?

23
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:06,850
Man, this is the future. If I can
get Wilt Chamberlain to wear 'em...

24
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:10,452
I predict there'll be a pair of those
in every closet in America.

25
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:12,656
That's gonna be
the height of fashion.

26
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,633
What's wrong?

27
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:20,664
- Nothin'.
- Alan!

28
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:24,242
Thanks, Bob.
What are you doing here?

29
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,642
I've told you before. This factory
isn't a playground. It's dangerous.

30
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:31,149
- Dad, can I have a ride home?
- Look, Alan.

31
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:34,185
Is Billy Jessup
picking on you again?

32
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,617
Son, you're gonna have to
face him sooner or later.

33
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,354
Look, if you're afraid of something,
you've got to stand and face it.

34
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:46,560
Now, run on, son.

35
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,201
Carl, you should know better
than to let the boy play in here.

36
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,362
Sorry, sir.

37
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:56,374
- What was it you wanted to show me?
- Just a minute, sir.

38
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:06,212
What the devil...

39
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:10,946
Get an extinguisher.

40
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,226
Who did this?

41
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:25,797
Well?

42
00:05:29,308 --> 00:05:30,741
I did, sir.

43
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:48,217
Just because you're a Parrish doesn't
mean you can hang around my girlfriend.

44
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:53,054
- We're just friends.
- Not anymore. Get him!

45
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,901
- Let's go!
- Okay, I've got his bike.

46
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:07,344
Jerks!

47
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:05,195
Wow.

48
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:56,011
Neat.

49
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:05,990
Alan. Are you home?

50
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:18,034
Oh, Alan, not again.
Come on.

51
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:23,936
Hard work, determination,
a cheerful outlook...

52
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,876
attributes that have exemplified
the Brantford spirit...

53
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:30,847
since our forefathers
first settled this town.

54
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:35,114
Despite the harshness of our native
clime and the granite of our soil...

55
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:38,281
- we have...
- Prospered.

56
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:42,383
- I knew the damn thing this morning.
- You'll know the darn thing tonight.

57
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:46,363
- All right. Let's go.
- Sam. We have to talk to Alan.

58
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:57,131
- Well, we're on our way.
- Okay.

59
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:01,475
I told your father what you told me this
afternoon. It wasn't just Billy Jessup.

60
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:04,106
Look, if I'd known that,
Alan, I wouldn't have...

61
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:07,845
- It's okay, Dad.
- I want you to know I am proud of you.

62
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,649
I mean, you faced them, even
though you were outnumbered.

63
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:13,782
And since you
took it like a man...

64
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:16,794
your mother and I have decided
that you're ready to go...

65
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:19,160
to the Cliffside School for Boys.

66
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:21,722
- There.
- Congratulations, sweetheart.

67
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:27,267
- You don't want me living here anymore?
- Alan.

68
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,405
It's always been the plan that you go
to Cliffside when you were ready.

69
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:35,845
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.

70
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:38,849
Even your Uncle Skylar
went there.

71
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:42,580
- Look at this. Parrish Hall.
- It's the main dormitory.

72
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:50,189
Oh, this is great. Kids are on my
case here because I'm a Parrish.

73
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:53,857
Just wait till I'm living in
a building named after me.

74
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:56,366
It was named
after my father.

75
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:59,892
- Good. Why don't you live in it?
- I did!

76
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:02,963
I wouldn't be who I am today
if it weren't for my years there.

77
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:08,375
Maybe I don't wanna be who you are.
Maybe I don't wanna be a Parrish.

78
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:14,179
You won't be.
Not till you start acting like one.

79
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:16,447
Get your coat!

80
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:22,692
I guess I'm not ready
for Cliffside then!

81
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:27,494
We're taking you there next Sunday! I
don't wanna hear another word about it!

82
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:31,730
You won't.
I'm never talking to you again!

83
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,240
- Sam...
- Don't!

84
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,677
- Sam...
- What?

85
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:43,008
Nothing. Just...

86
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:13,672
- What are you doing here?
- I brought your bike back.

87
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:17,806
You didn't have to. I was going
over to Billy's to get it myself.

88
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:21,717
I told Billy to stop
picking on you.

89
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:25,517
You shouldn't have wasted your breath.
We'll talk about this some other time.

90
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:28,024
What was that?

91
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,723
- You heard it too?
- Of course I heard it.

92
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:37,399
Come on. I found this weird game
in the factory.

93
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:39,198
A game?

94
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:57,213
"Jumanji.

95
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:01,885
A game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind.

96
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,555
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles gets another turn.

97
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,929
And the first player to reach
the end wins." You wanna play?

98
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,766
I quit playing board games
five years ago.

99
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:17,708
Sarah.

100
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:27,545
- It's gotta be magnetized or something.
- Alan, look.

101
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:33,386
"At night they fly,
you better run...

102
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,155
these winged things
are not much fun."

103
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:47,769
- What was that?
- I don't know.

104
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,765
- Put it away, Alan!
- Okay.

105
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,283
Oh, no.
The game thinks I rolled.

106
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:04,451
What do you mean,
"The game thinks"?

107
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,491
"In the jungle you must wait...

108
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:13,554
until the dice
read five or eight."

109
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,394
"In the jungle you must wait..."
What's that mean?

110
00:14:37,022 --> 00:14:40,185
Roll the dice!

111
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:22,062
I think a bed-and-breakfast
is just what this town needs.

112
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:25,899
Well, it's pretty hard to pass up,
especially full of furniture.

113
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,066
Oh, boy! I keep forgetting
how big this place is.

114
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,735
Judy, Peter,
come look at this.

115
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:35,075
I'm gonna put
a reception area over here.

116
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:39,141
And a bar over here
in the parlor.

117
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:47,818
That sounds lovely. I'm sure you and
your kids are gonna be very happy here.

118
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:52,386
Oh. Well, actually,
they're my late brother's.

119
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:55,399
He and his wife passed away
just last winter.

120
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:01,268
Is this something,
or what?

121
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,608
It sure is.

122
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:21,782
So, what do you think, young man?
Is it big enough for you?

123
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:36,331
Peter hasn't spoken a word
since it happened.

124
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:43,207
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.
How terribly awful.

125
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:48,378
It's okay.
We barely even knew our parents.

126
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:53,254
They were always away... skiing in
Saint Moritz, gambling in Monte Carlo...

127
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:57,260
safariing in darkest Africa.

128
00:16:57,328 --> 00:17:00,764
We didn't even know
if they loved us.

129
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:03,767
But when the sheik's yacht
went down, well...

130
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:06,861
they managed to write us
a really beautiful good-bye note...

131
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:11,602
that was found floating in
a champagne bottle amongst the debris.

132
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:12,938
Excuse me.

133
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:24,888
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

134
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,982
- So you'll send me those escrow papers?
- First thing tomorrow.

135
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:03,087
I'll have to get a locksmith
out for this one.

136
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,686
Peter, pick up your toys,
please.

137
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:15,631
Peter, take this suitcase
up to the attic.

138
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:19,165
Then we can all have
ice cream and bourbon.

139
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:48,305
What? What is it?

140
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,876
- I'm going to Motel 6.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.

141
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:21,532
I don't see any guano.

142
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:30,041
- He said it looked like that.
- That's an African bat.

143
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,810
Some kid said she saw a bunch
of those back in the '60s.

144
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:36,285
But we don't get bats
like that in New England.

145
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:40,222
- But that's what he saw.
- Well, whatever it was...

146
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,782
is gone now.

147
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,921
Bats aren't what I'd worry about
in this house anyways.

148
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:48,795
What would you worry about?

149
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,959
Well, personally...

150
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:54,061
I wouldn't wanna live in a house
where someone was murdered.

151
00:19:56,774 --> 00:19:58,173
- Murdered?
- Yep.

152
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:01,234
Little Alan Parrish.
I say his father did it.

153
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:06,413
There's a thousand and one places he
could have hid the body in this house.

154
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:10,454
Especially if he
chopped it up first.

155
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:15,083
Hey, up there! You kids don't wanna
be late for your first day of school.

156
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,260
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
- Ya hear that?

157
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:26,064
There is nothing
to be afraid of in this house.

158
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,991
I can't believe I have to see
your principal after the first day.

159
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:57,659
What am I gonna do?

160
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:04,738
Let's just try to relax and finish our
dinner and talk about something else.

161
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:07,243
Well, we found out why
you got this house so cheap.

162
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:11,907
Twenty-six years ago, a kid named
Alan Parrish used to live here.

163
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:14,178
Then one day,
he just disappeared...

164
00:21:14,252 --> 00:21:18,211
'cause his parents chopped him up in
little pieces and hid him in the walls.

165
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:22,225
Okay, that's it. I am sick and tired of
your lies, young lady. You're grounded.

166
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,327
Fine. There's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

167
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,200
And just for your information,
that wasn't a lie.

168
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:13,766
Did you hear anything
a little while ago?

169
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:18,914
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

170
00:22:20,518 --> 00:22:23,487
- No.
- Liar.

171
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:27,149
If you don't cut that out,
they're gonna send you to a shrink.

172
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:30,956
Where do you think they're gonna
send you if you don't start talking?

173
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:52,176
If I get held up at the permit office,
I'll give you a call.

174
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,515
School bus should be here
any minute.

175
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:59,021
You guys still have
your house keys?

176
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,082
You guys listening to me?

177
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:05,328
Hello?

178
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:09,131
- Hello?
- What?

179
00:23:11,002 --> 00:23:13,266
Maybe I should wait
with you till the bus comes.

180
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:17,364
Did your parents used
to put you on the bus?

181
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:19,966
- No. No.
- Are you sure?

182
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:22,870
I could drop you off.

183
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:26,974
No, don't worry about us.
The bus'll be here any minute.

184
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:30,282
Okay.
Please be good today.

185
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:43,757
- You do hear it.
- Hear what?

186
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:01,117
Where's it coming from?

187
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,616
Wow.

188
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:36,084
Let's bring it over here.

189
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,666
Weird. They're stuck.

190
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:56,196
"Jumanji. A game for those who seek to
find a way to leave their world behind.

191
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:59,071
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles get another turn.

192
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:02,442
The first player
to reach the end wins."

193
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:10,481
It's gotta be microchips
or something.

194
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:14,484
You go first.

195
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,594
Okay.

196
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:22,092
Six.

197
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:39,339
"A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

198
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:18,645
Don't!

199
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:26,227
"This will not be
an easy mission...

200
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:28,993
monkeys slow the expedition."

201
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:35,031
What is that?

202
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,409
I bet those monkeys came from the game.
The mosquitoes too.

203
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:24,753
Uh-oh.
I didn't see this part.

204
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:30,887
"Adventurers beware."

205
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:41,298
"Adventurers beware. Do not begin
unless you intend to finish.

206
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:44,102
The exciting consequences
of the game will vanish...

207
00:27:44,175 --> 00:27:47,406
only when a player has reached
Jumanji and called out its name."

208
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:49,605
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.

209
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,773
- Put it away.
- Wait!

210
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:54,613
The instructions say if we
finish the game, it'll all go away.

211
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:57,085
We better do it,
or Aunt Nora's gonna pitch a fit.

212
00:27:57,154 --> 00:28:00,817
We should just get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.

213
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:07,154
No, you rolled doubles.
You get another turn.

214
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,789
Roll!

215
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:10,993
Five.

216
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:18,736
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.

217
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:23,075
Your party better move
poste haste."

218
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:25,775
I don't like the sound of that.

219
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,752
Judy, someone's in here.

220
00:28:50,507 --> 00:28:54,375
It's not real, Peter.
It's a hallucination.

221
00:28:54,745 --> 00:28:57,111
Run, Peter!

222
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,044
I'm back.

223
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:31,361
Somebody roll
a five or an eight?

224
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:34,971
He did.

225
00:31:41,545 --> 00:31:44,241
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

226
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:50,778
Thank you.
Sorry if I scared you.

227
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:53,118
Sorry if I scared you.
Thank you.

228
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,217
I'm back! Mom! Dad!

229
00:31:59,096 --> 00:32:01,690
I'm home!

230
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:04,290
I'm back!

231
00:32:04,368 --> 00:32:08,600
It's me!
It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!

232
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:11,732
I'm home! I'm back.

233
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,438
Are you my little sister?

234
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:18,879
No.
I'm Judy and he's Peter.

235
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:21,577
Where's Mom?
Is Dad at the factory?

236
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:26,382
Are you Alan Parrish?

237
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:29,585
Yeah.
Who are you?

238
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,594
We live here now.

239
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,764
- Where's my mom and dad?
- We don't know.

240
00:32:38,068 --> 00:32:41,469
This house has been empty
for years.

241
00:32:41,538 --> 00:32:43,938
Everyone thought you were dead.

242
00:32:54,852 --> 00:32:56,376
Sorry.

243
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:04,726
<i>- Gimme that description again.</i>
- I said, red fur and long fail.

244
00:33:14,838 --> 00:33:17,602
Get down off of my car, please.

245
00:33:17,674 --> 00:33:19,767
And get up on the sidewalk.

246
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:24,780
- What year is it?
- It was brand new.

247
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:28,409
No.
What year is it?

248
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:31,386
- Uh, 1995, remember?
- '95.

249
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:35,653
You got some I. D? Oh, let me guess.
You left it in your other Tarzan outfit?

250
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:38,854
- Twenty-six years.
- Are you from around here?

251
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:42,194
I was!
But I've been in Jumanji.

252
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:44,928
Indonesia.
He was in the Peace Corps.

253
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,494
Bentley.

254
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:55,541
- Carl Bentley, the Soleman.
- Is this man related to you?

255
00:33:55,612 --> 00:33:59,776
- Yes, sir. He's our uncle.
- Does he always dress like that?

256
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,512
Well, yeah,
he's a vegetarian.

257
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:04,747
Get out of there!

258
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:13,325
Monkeys! Monkeys.

259
00:34:14,298 --> 00:34:16,027
Is he all right upstairs?

260
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,263
Uh, he suffered a head injury
a few months ago.

261
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:33,439
Hey! Hey... What?

262
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:37,317
Don't you move!
Freeze! Hey!

263
00:34:37,387 --> 00:34:39,355
Don't move. Don't move.

264
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:44,490
- Wait a minute! Where are you going?
- To find my parents!

265
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:47,727
Come on.

266
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:15,354
Wait!

267
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,448
My dad used to
make shoes here.

268
00:36:13,984 --> 00:36:16,077
They were the best shoes
in New England.

269
00:36:19,323 --> 00:36:20,756
Hey!

270
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:28,790
Sorry.

271
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:32,831
Easy, girl.

272
00:36:37,607 --> 00:36:40,474
Do you know what happened
to this shoe factory?

273
00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:46,546
Yeah, it folded up,
like everything else in this town.

274
00:36:46,616 --> 00:36:50,108
Hey, it's pretty cold out there.
How 'bout some coffee?

275
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:53,247
Why would they close
Parrish Shoes?

276
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:58,460
When his kid ran away, Sam put
all he had into trying to find him.

277
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:00,553
His time, his money.

278
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,621
Everything.

279
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:05,827
After a while,
he stopped comin' to work.

280
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:09,201
He just quit carin'.

281
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:13,402
I don't think anybody
loved his boy more than Sam did.

282
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:17,146
Here.

283
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:21,540
You're gonna freeze out there.

284
00:37:22,853 --> 00:37:26,550
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes still around?

285
00:37:27,491 --> 00:37:30,517
- I see 'em now and then.
- Yeah?

286
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:33,320
They're over on Adams Street.

287
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:54,442
Our parents are dead too.

288
00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:59,984
They were in the Middle East
negotiating peace when...

289
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,864
Our dad was in advertising.

290
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,103
I bet you miss him, huh?
Me too.

291
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:21,276
There he goes again.

292
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,582
Listen, I know you're upset and all, but
I kinda feel we should finish the game.

293
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,949
We?
Why do you need me?

294
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,989
Just in case any other
scary stuff comes out.

295
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:35,820
Plus, there's a lion in my aunt's
bedroom. What should I do about that?

296
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:39,589
- Do I look like a Ringling Brother?
- But she'll be home soon.

297
00:38:39,663 --> 00:38:43,497
Won't she be surprised.
Hope she's not allergic to cats.

298
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:01,250
Larry, we need the wheels.
Gimme a hand.

299
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:03,252
Did we hit her that hard?

300
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,380
No, it looks like another one
of those weird bites.

301
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:14,127
It's another one.

302
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:17,189
Geez, that's over 50.
What the hell's goin' on?

303
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:18,529
Easy now.

304
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:21,799
- Hey, look. Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
- Who's that?

305
00:39:21,872 --> 00:39:25,171
- The realtor.
- Quiet. Listen.

306
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:27,733
You hear that?

307
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:31,508
- Hear what?
- Get in the car.

308
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:41,116
Okay, think.
What came out of the game before me?

309
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:45,491
- There was a lion, a bunch of monkeys...
- That!

310
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:51,129
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just a bug.

311
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:54,830
But we're safe in here.
See? We're fine.

312
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:02,001
As long as we stay low, he can't get
through there too far. Don't worry.

313
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,807
We're fine.

314
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,940
Hey, he can't get us in here.
He can't get through the glass.

315
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:09,184
We're safe.

316
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:16,222
Either one of you know how to drive?
No? Well, that's no problem.

317
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:21,731
Well, my dad used to let me back
the car down the driveway once.

318
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:23,857
- So what's the big deal?
- Buckle up.

319
00:40:23,934 --> 00:40:26,630
Here we go!

320
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:32,375
Oh, wait a minute.
What... Wait.

321
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:39,172
Alan, the top!

322
00:40:56,566 --> 00:40:58,500
Piece of cake.

323
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:01,563
Yeah.

324
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:22,291
Keep that thing away from me!

325
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:25,185
When are you gonna
help us play?

326
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:27,855
We've gotta hurry.
Our aunt's gonna be home soon.

327
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:32,391
Well, good. You can inform her
that she's the ex-owner of this house.

328
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:36,838
I hope you realize, with my parents
gone, this home belongs to me.

329
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:43,369
Oh, thank you.

330
00:41:43,446 --> 00:41:45,380
No more banana leaves.

331
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:55,320
What do you think those monkeys are
gonna do to the ecosystem around here?

332
00:41:55,392 --> 00:41:57,519
<i>Just sit right back</i>
and you'll hear a tale

333
00:41:57,594 --> 00:42:00,085
<i>- A tale of a fateful trip</i>
- Hello!

334
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:03,064
<i>That started out on this tropic port</i>
aboard this tiny ship

335
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:05,727
<i>The mate was</i>
a mighty sailor man

336
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:07,895
<i>The skipper</i>
brave and sure

337
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:12,340
<i>Five passengers set sail that day</i>
for a three-hour four

338
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:33,492
What happened to you?
You shave with a piece of glass?

339
00:42:33,563 --> 00:42:36,396
What happened to you?
The Clampetts have a yard sale?

340
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:39,501
What do you want?
I've never shaved before.

341
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:41,529
Where are you going?

342
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:46,569
How 'bout Peter and I play,
and you just sort of watch?

343
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:48,201
No, thanks.
I've seen it.

344
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:52,343
So if you're not gonna help us,
what are you gonna do?

345
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:56,249
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I left off.

346
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,186
I wonder if Mrs. Nedermeyer's
still teaching sixth grade.

347
00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:11,599
Come on, Judy.
He's not gonna help us. He's afraid.

348
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:14,727
What did you say?

349
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:18,532
You're afraid.
It's okay to be afraid.

350
00:43:22,278 --> 00:43:24,576
Let's go set it up
in the living room.

351
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,408
No, you have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

352
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:34,821
Whatever it is, we'll handle it
by ourselves. We don't need your help.

353
00:43:34,891 --> 00:43:36,722
I don't think so.

354
00:43:36,793 --> 00:43:41,355
You think monkeys,
mosquitoes and lions are bad?

355
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:44,457
That's just the beginning.

356
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:48,334
I've seen things you've only
seen in your nightmares.

357
00:43:48,404 --> 00:43:51,669
Things you can't even imagine.

358
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:54,175
Things you can't even see.

359
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:58,510
There are things that'll
hunt you in the night.

360
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:02,950
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eat.

361
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:07,012
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

362
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,650
Afraid?

363
00:44:09,726 --> 00:44:12,854
You don't even know
what afraid is.

364
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:15,762
You will not last
five minutes without me.

365
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:20,729
So are you gonna help us?

366
00:44:23,173 --> 00:44:25,107
I'll watch.

367
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:31,213
But I'm not afraid.

368
00:44:41,124 --> 00:44:44,252
Peter, that was very cool.

369
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:49,094
That's reverse psychology.
Dad used to pull it on me all the time.

370
00:44:49,165 --> 00:44:52,794
- Ready?
- Yeah.

371
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:55,364
Alan, ready?

372
00:44:55,438 --> 00:44:57,372
There is no "ready."

373
00:45:07,317 --> 00:45:09,410
I'll try it again.

374
00:45:17,293 --> 00:45:18,954
It's not working.

375
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:30,839
Oh, no. It's not your turn.

376
00:45:30,907 --> 00:45:32,932
Yeah. I rolled first...

377
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:35,978
and then Peter twice 'cause he got
doubles, and now it's my turn again.

378
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,075
No, look. Two of those
pieces are yours, right?

379
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,412
Whose are the other pieces?

380
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:47,522
The elephant was mine.

381
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,686
You're playing the game
I started in 1969.

382
00:45:55,665 --> 00:45:57,758
I'm gonna have to play.

383
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:04,797
It's not my turn.

384
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:06,808
Whose turn is it?

385
00:46:10,313 --> 00:46:12,543
Sarah Whittle.

386
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,383
This is where
she used to live.

387
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:26,020
This place gives me the creeps.

388
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,533
We used to play
on this porch.

389
00:46:42,412 --> 00:46:44,778
I knew she still
wouldn't live here.

390
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,577
Probably married Billy Jessup and
they're living in a trailer park.

391
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,710
- Let's go.
- Maybe she'II know where Sarah went.

392
00:46:50,787 --> 00:46:53,483
Of course she'll know where Sarah went.
She's a psychic.

393
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:55,023
Good point.

394
00:46:58,294 --> 00:47:00,694
- I remember the porch being bigger.
- Hello?

395
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:05,760
- Um, can you help us?
- Do you have an appointment?

396
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:08,065
No, we're just trying
to find someone.

397
00:47:08,137 --> 00:47:12,267
- Madam Serena can't see you right now.
- Maybe you can help us.

398
00:47:16,012 --> 00:47:17,673
What is it?

399
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:19,874
We're looking for someone
who used to live here.

400
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:22,543
No, I've lived here
my whole life.

401
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:25,086
Well, then you must know
Sarah Whittle.

402
00:47:30,026 --> 00:47:32,119
What do you want
with Sarah Whittle?

403
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,163
No, I don't go
by that name anymore.

404
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:44,763
What do you want?

405
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:51,213
Twenty-six years ago, you played a game
with a little boy down the street.

406
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:55,850
A game with drums.

407
00:48:00,323 --> 00:48:01,756
How do you know that?

408
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:06,289
I was that little boy,
Sarah.

409
00:48:18,408 --> 00:48:20,968
You killed her.

410
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:24,206
<i>Leave a message and the docfor</i>
will call you back...

411
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,147
<i>at his earliest convenience.</i>

412
00:48:27,216 --> 00:48:29,275
<i>Dr. Boorstein.</i>
Sarah Whittle calling.

413
00:48:29,352 --> 00:48:31,752
If you could call me back
as soon as you can...

414
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:34,722
I think I need to have
my dosage checked.

415
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,884
That event we've been discussing
for a long time now...

416
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:39,553
the one that
didn't really happen...

417
00:48:39,629 --> 00:48:43,531
I'm havin' an episode here with the
little boy that didn't really disappear.

418
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,762
I'm sittin' in his living room
drinkin' lemonade.

419
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:50,135
If you could call me, I'd really
be interested in your interpretation.

420
00:48:50,206 --> 00:48:53,903
Thank you so much. He'II call me back
ten minutes before the hour.

421
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:56,740
- While we're waiting...
- Whoa, God!

422
00:48:56,813 --> 00:48:59,407
- Sarah!
- No, no, no, no!

423
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:02,576
- Sarah, please!
- I spent over 2,000 hours in therapy...

424
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:04,745
convincing myself that
that doesn't exist.

425
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:06,812
What happened to you was so awful,
I made up that whole thing.

426
00:49:06,889 --> 00:49:10,848
- Sarah, it was awful. It really was.
- Am I crazy?

427
00:49:12,361 --> 00:49:14,659
It was real. Real.

428
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:16,664
No, no, no.
It wasn't real.

429
00:49:16,732 --> 00:49:19,166
Your father murdered you and
chopped you up in little pieces.

430
00:49:19,235 --> 00:49:24,229
Sarah, come on.
My dad did that?

431
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:27,902
My father could
barely hug me...

432
00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:30,343
let alone cut me
into little pieces.

433
00:49:30,413 --> 00:49:33,041
Twenty-six years ago...

434
00:49:33,116 --> 00:49:35,983
we started playing
a little game.

435
00:49:36,052 --> 00:49:39,886
And now we're all
gonna sit down...

436
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:41,890
and we're
gonna finish it.

437
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:45,086
And guess what?
Your turn.

438
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,431
No!

439
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:57,638
Play the game.

440
00:49:57,707 --> 00:50:00,642
- Oh, no, no, no.
- All right.

441
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:06,771
Just gimme the dice and you can go home.
You don't have to play.

442
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:08,476
Thank you, Alan.

443
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:12,385
Oh, my God!
How could you do that?

444
00:50:12,455 --> 00:50:15,891
It's the law of the jungle, Sarah.
You'll get used to it.

445
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:20,088
And I think of all the energy I spent
visualizing you as a radiant spirit.

446
00:50:20,163 --> 00:50:21,630
Go on, read it.

447
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:32,340
"They grow much faster than bamboo.
Take care or they'll come after you."

448
00:50:35,378 --> 00:50:40,247
- Oh, great.
- Oh, God. Tell me this isn't happening.

449
00:50:40,316 --> 00:50:42,250
Oh, it is.

450
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:45,082
Stay away from the walls.
Don't touch anything.

451
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:47,486
No quick movements.

452
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:55,757
- Wow, they're beautiful.
- Oh, yeah, they're beautiful.

453
00:50:55,831 --> 00:50:59,028
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.

454
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:01,262
And definitely
stay away from the pods.

455
00:51:01,337 --> 00:51:03,430
The big yellow ones.

456
00:51:03,506 --> 00:51:05,633
What big yellow ones?

457
00:51:09,011 --> 00:51:10,911
Peter!

458
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,107
I got ya!
Get his arms!

459
00:51:13,182 --> 00:51:15,377
Get it off me!

460
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:25,086
Oh, my God!

461
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,300
- Hang on, boy.
- Grab him!

462
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,133
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, my God!

463
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,202
Sorry, Angus.

464
00:51:42,812 --> 00:51:45,645
Whoa. Harvest time!

465
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:55,517
Are you okay?

466
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:05,232
Oh, my God!

467
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:09,966
My car.
Oh, my car.

468
00:52:11,307 --> 00:52:14,208
<i>Has anybody seen Carl?</i>

469
00:52:14,277 --> 00:52:16,973
<i>- I can't believe this. Start. Please.</i>
- Carl, come in please.

470
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:23,083
<i>- Carl here.</i>
- Where have you been?

471
00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:25,518
<i>We've got a serious</i>
animal control situation.

472
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:28,386
You gotta get Stan and Willy on it.
I'm headin' to the old Parrish place...

473
00:52:28,457 --> 00:52:30,652
to check a suspicious character.

474
00:52:32,795 --> 00:52:34,387
I should've been a fireman.

475
00:52:47,777 --> 00:52:49,369
Get your hands off me!

476
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:52,778
- The game is not over yet, Sarah.
- It is for me.

477
00:52:52,848 --> 00:52:57,842
You are not in the jungle anymore. Stop
this! You don't treat people like this.

478
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:15,593
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

479
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:24,671
Alan, please. Last time I played
this game, it ruined my life.

480
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:28,813
It ruined your life?

481
00:53:28,884 --> 00:53:33,150
"In the jungle you must wait,
till the dice read five or eight."

482
00:53:34,323 --> 00:53:37,292
I was a little girl, Alan.

483
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,295
You disappeared.

484
00:53:40,363 --> 00:53:44,959
And a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street.

485
00:53:45,968 --> 00:53:47,196
I was afraid.

486
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:50,835
I'm sorry, Alan.

487
00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:53,704
No one believed me.
I was all alone.

488
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:55,710
So was I.

489
00:53:55,778 --> 00:53:58,212
For 26 years, Sarah.

490
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:03,146
Me too.

491
00:54:03,219 --> 00:54:06,655
It's okay, Sarah.
We're scared too.

492
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:10,123
But if we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

493
00:54:10,192 --> 00:54:14,253
- What if I get stuck in the game?
- You won't.

494
00:54:16,265 --> 00:54:18,460
Because I won't stop playing.

495
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:21,901
- And neither will I.
- I won't either.

496
00:54:30,146 --> 00:54:33,081
- Come on, Sarah.
- Please?

497
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:43,752
I knew this was
gonna be a bad day.

498
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:47,855
Hey, come on.
We'II be fine.

499
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,057
We just have to
keep our heads.

500
00:54:52,301 --> 00:54:53,791
Roll with the punches.

501
00:55:12,154 --> 00:55:17,148
"A hunter from
the darkest wild...

502
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:21,026
makes you feel
just like a child."

503
00:55:21,096 --> 00:55:25,089
- What is it?
- Van Pelt.

504
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,806
You miserable coward!
Come back and face me like a man.

505
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:46,321
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

506
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:48,720
Coming, ready or not.

507
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:09,473
Hey, you!

508
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:16,411
Drop your gun and get
your hands in the air!

509
00:56:42,144 --> 00:56:44,635
Man, I don't believe this.

510
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:55,651
Even if Alan gets out of this,
the same kind of thing's...

511
00:56:55,724 --> 00:56:57,658
gonna happen over and over again.

512
00:56:57,726 --> 00:57:02,959
When you carry around so much anger,
it attracts a lot of negative energy.

513
00:57:03,032 --> 00:57:06,661
And things happen, like ending up
in the jungle. That was no accident.

514
00:57:06,735 --> 00:57:09,329
- There are no accidents.
- Whose turn is it?

515
00:57:09,405 --> 00:57:13,000
- It's my turn.
- Really? Great.

516
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:15,908
You might have told us there was a man
in there with a rifle that hunts people.

517
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:18,913
I didn't know, okay?
It's just the roll of the dice.

518
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:21,449
Is he the reason
you didn't wanna play?

519
00:57:23,886 --> 00:57:25,979
You didn't wanna play either...

520
00:57:26,055 --> 00:57:30,048
Mr. We-Started-Something-26-Years-Ago-
And-Now-We-Gotta-Finish-It?

521
00:57:32,695 --> 00:57:35,163
- What's the deal with you and this guy?
- He's a hunter.

522
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:38,859
He kills things. Right now,
he wants to hunt me and kill me.

523
00:57:38,934 --> 00:57:41,402
- Why you?
- Why me? I don't know.

524
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:44,405
Everything about me he finds offensive.
You think it'd be a waste of his time.

525
00:57:44,473 --> 00:57:48,102
- Maybe he needs something for his wall.
- It's your turn.

526
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:51,271
You ever thought about sitting down
and talking about your differences?

527
00:57:51,347 --> 00:57:53,315
What, are you crazy?
The man has a gun.

528
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:55,612
Don't ever call me crazy, Alan.

529
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,278
Ever. 'Cause everyone in this town
has called me crazy...

530
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:00,879
ever since I told the cops
you were sucked into a board game.

531
00:58:00,956 --> 00:58:04,289
- Maybe I should roll.
- You know what it's like to be known...

532
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,385
as the little girl
who saw Alan Parrish murdered?

533
00:58:06,462 --> 00:58:08,953
You think anybody showed up
at my 14th birthday party?

534
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:11,761
- Hello. I'm rolling now.
- Billy who?

535
00:58:11,834 --> 00:58:15,270
- I'm gonna roll.
- Are you an owl?

536
00:58:15,337 --> 00:58:17,931
- Dig into your higher consciousness...
- Here, just roll.

537
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:21,238
And find the memory
of your old boyfriend.

538
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:24,370
- The kid who stole your bicycle?
- No, the kid who took you to movies.

539
00:58:24,446 --> 00:58:26,937
"Don't be fooled.
It isn't thunder.

540
00:58:27,016 --> 00:58:29,041
Staying put
would be a blunder."

541
00:58:29,118 --> 00:58:31,018
- No, you're immature.
- You are.

542
00:58:31,086 --> 00:58:33,247
I know you are,
but what am I?

543
00:58:34,723 --> 00:58:36,554
Do you feel that?

544
00:58:37,626 --> 00:58:39,287
Listen.

545
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:04,314
Run!
It's a stampede!

546
00:59:06,055 --> 00:59:07,613
The game!

547
00:59:14,496 --> 00:59:15,690
Don't look back!

548
00:59:42,524 --> 00:59:44,321
Not the game!

549
00:59:53,202 --> 00:59:55,796
Why didn't you
grab the game, Peter?

550
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:57,634
Ignore him, honey.
He's a Libra.

551
00:59:57,706 --> 00:59:59,970
- Where are you going?
- He'll head for water!

552
01:00:03,479 --> 01:00:05,777
<i>Judy, if's Aunt Nora.</i>
Where have you been?

553
01:00:05,848 --> 01:00:08,942
I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.

554
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:13,086
Wait for me!

555
01:00:31,406 --> 01:00:34,603
- What can I do for you?
- I want a gross of these.

556
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:38,168
You know, they stopped
making these in 1903.

557
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:41,910
Damn. I shall need
a replacement weapon.

558
01:00:41,984 --> 01:00:43,542
There's a waiting period...

559
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:45,678
and you'll have to...

560
01:00:45,754 --> 01:00:47,688
fill out these.

561
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,022
Or I could fill these out.

562
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,134
Now, anyone asks,
you didn't get this here.

563
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:09,235
You're not a postal worker,
are you?

564
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,143
Quiet.

565
01:01:29,298 --> 01:01:30,822
Okay.

566
01:01:40,042 --> 01:01:41,009
No!

567
01:02:53,749 --> 01:02:56,343
- Peter, that was great.
- Are you okay?

568
01:02:56,418 --> 01:02:58,978
I can't believe you did that.
That was so cool.

569
01:02:59,054 --> 01:03:01,249
- You gave me chills.
- It was great.

570
01:03:05,394 --> 01:03:08,591
It's nice work.
Come on, gimme the game. Let's go.

571
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:30,880
Act natural.

572
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:37,418
- Hey!
- Hide the game.

573
01:03:43,098 --> 01:03:46,625
I don't believe this. Every time
there's trouble, I run into you.

574
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:49,569
Me? I don't know
what you're talking about.

575
01:03:49,638 --> 01:03:51,936
- I'm taking you in for questioning.
- I'm not going anywhere.

576
01:03:57,779 --> 01:04:00,475
Just a second.
You can't take him. He's...

577
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:03,245
- Her fiance.
- I thought he was your uncle.

578
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,747
It's all right.
I'll be back soon.

579
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,154
Blast.

580
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,992
Remember you said you'd never
abandon your friends?

581
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:19,056
- We'll finish the game later.
- Later?

582
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:24,598
I suggest you all
go home now.

583
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:26,163
Okay.

584
01:04:30,946 --> 01:04:33,972
Now how are we supposed
to finish the game?

585
01:04:34,049 --> 01:04:36,279
We can't. We can't finish it
without him.

586
01:04:38,053 --> 01:04:39,987
What?

587
01:04:42,624 --> 01:04:43,921
What happened?

588
01:04:43,992 --> 01:04:47,189
I thought I could end the game.
I was only ten spaces away.

589
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:49,992
"A law of Jumanji
having been broken...

590
01:04:50,065 --> 01:04:52,431
you will slip back
even more than your token."

591
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:55,263
You tried to cheat?

592
01:04:55,337 --> 01:04:58,534
No. I tried to drop the dice
so they'd land on 12.

593
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:00,939
Oh, okay, honey.
Well, that would be cheating.

594
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:05,345
Peter, your hands!
Look at your hands!

595
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,403
<i>Ray, come in, this is Willie.</i>

596
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:36,137
<i>They cleaned out Larry's Hardware,</i>
and they're headed for Parrish Common.

597
01:05:36,211 --> 01:05:40,079
<i>I can't stop 'em, Lorraine. You gotta</i>
get the Nafional Guard down here now!

598
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:42,844
What is this about?
I know you know.

599
01:05:42,918 --> 01:05:46,877
Yes, I do, but you wouldn't believe me
even if I told you, Carl.

600
01:05:46,955 --> 01:05:50,391
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

601
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:52,359
I know a lot more than that.

602
01:05:52,427 --> 01:05:55,419
I know you used to work on the
stamping line at Parrish Shoes.

603
01:05:55,497 --> 01:05:57,522
They used to call you
Soleman.

604
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,227
Soleman.
Yeah, that's right.

605
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:03,669
I was in there too, until
old man Parrish fired me.

606
01:06:03,738 --> 01:06:05,865
- He fired you?
- Yeah, man.

607
01:06:05,941 --> 01:06:09,274
And I had something I could've turned
this whole town around.

608
01:06:09,344 --> 01:06:11,744
- Your shoes.
- Right.

609
01:06:11,813 --> 01:06:13,747
Listen, Carl...

610
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,119
I know it doesn't mean much
after 26 years...

611
01:06:18,186 --> 01:06:21,417
but I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

612
01:06:22,757 --> 01:06:26,249
- Sorry for what?
- It's me, Alan.

613
01:06:30,432 --> 01:06:32,900
Thank you.
Come on.

614
01:06:32,968 --> 01:06:36,734
- What's going on?
- Apparently there's a sale happening.

615
01:06:42,344 --> 01:06:45,313
You just saw three monkeys
go by on a motorcycle, didn't you?

616
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,314
- Yes.
- Good girl. Come on.

617
01:06:49,985 --> 01:06:52,044
Maybe we can bail him out
with a check.

618
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,644
Thanks.

619
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:56,657
You tell that sniveling coward
from me, if he wants...

620
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:00,353
Give me that, boy!

621
01:08:01,723 --> 01:08:04,851
Hey! Help me!

622
01:08:04,926 --> 01:08:07,451
Get me outta here!

623
01:08:07,529 --> 01:08:10,362
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Peter. Come on.

624
01:08:38,727 --> 01:08:39,989
There it is!

625
01:08:40,061 --> 01:08:41,892
Wait here.

626
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:52,600
Got ya, girlie.

627
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:57,209
When Alan hears
of your predicament, he'll come.

628
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:01,010
He doesn't know I'm here,
so this isn't gonna work. I'm going.

629
01:09:03,418 --> 01:09:06,444
Don't move or I'II blow
your blinking brains out!

630
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:08,386
Call the cops!

631
01:09:08,456 --> 01:09:10,447
- That should do it, don't ya think?
- Oh, yeah.

632
01:09:15,497 --> 01:09:16,930
Price check.

633
01:09:20,969 --> 01:09:24,200
If you let me go,
I can stop all this.

634
01:09:25,507 --> 01:09:28,032
<i>It sounds like something out of the</i>
Twilight Zone, but it's true.

635
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:30,703
Please.
You gotta help me on this.

636
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:32,246
I know I'm gonna regret it.

637
01:09:34,449 --> 01:09:36,383
Just hold still.

638
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,550
There. I let you go.
Now what are we gonna do?

639
01:09:43,391 --> 01:09:45,154
- You are gonna stay here.
- Those are my keys!

640
01:09:45,226 --> 01:09:46,818
It's for your own good.
You just stay there.

641
01:09:46,895 --> 01:09:50,262
- My handcuff keys. Wait.
- This is something I have to do.

642
01:09:50,332 --> 01:09:52,562
- Alan!
- You'll thank me someday.

643
01:09:52,634 --> 01:09:57,367
<i>Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot</i>
involving a woman and two children.

644
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:00,806
<i>Sounds like the armed perpetrator in</i>
the pith helmet and khakis you reported.

645
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:04,174
<i>- Carl? Come in, Carl.</i>
- Lorraine, come in. Lorraine!

646
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:06,236
- What's Sir Sav-a-Iot?
- It's a discount store.

647
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:09,306
- Move over.
- Wait. Gently.

648
01:10:09,384 --> 01:10:11,147
All right.

649
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:13,744
Don't worry.
I've done this before once.

650
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,578
- Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?
- Monroe and Elm.

651
01:10:41,649 --> 01:10:43,776
- The Episcopal church.
- No, it's not a church anymore.

652
01:10:43,852 --> 01:10:47,185
Now it's a Speedy Burger, or it was.
I don't know what's left of it.

653
01:10:47,255 --> 01:10:48,847
People in this town
are goin' loopy.

654
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:03,404
We got company.

655
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:06,338
It's all right.
That's a traffic cop. He'll back us up.

656
01:11:59,661 --> 01:12:02,129
- Here's the game.
- Come on. Get outta here.

657
01:12:28,356 --> 01:12:30,586
- Turn the siren off. Right there!
- I got it.

658
01:12:30,658 --> 01:12:32,285
Okay!

659
01:12:39,133 --> 01:12:42,125
Stop your cringing.
I could have shot you at any moment.

660
01:12:42,203 --> 01:12:43,568
Then why didn't you?

661
01:12:43,638 --> 01:12:46,300
You didn't roll the dice.
Alan did.

662
01:12:46,374 --> 01:12:48,672
There it is.
Hit the brakes.

663
01:12:48,743 --> 01:12:50,768
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hittin' 'em.

664
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:54,144
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hittin' the brakes!

665
01:12:55,517 --> 01:12:57,508
He should be here any moment.

666
01:13:20,675 --> 01:13:22,040
You're all right?

667
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:24,840
- Where's Peter?
- I'm here.

668
01:13:27,482 --> 01:13:29,313
Oh, great.

669
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,250
<i>So remember...</i>

01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:36,916

671
01:13:37,992 --> 01:13:39,926
<i>End of tape three.</i>

672
01:13:41,663 --> 01:13:44,791

<i>to dial 9-1-1.</i>

679
01:14:45,927 --> 01:14:47,554
I got it.

680
01:14:49,697 --> 01:14:52,393
Alan, talk to him. Please?

681
01:14:52,467 --> 01:14:54,833
What? We don't have time
for this, okay?

682
01:14:54,902 --> 01:14:58,497
I know, but he's a kid
and he was trying to help.

683
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:00,939
- All right.
- Thank you.

684
01:15:04,946 --> 01:15:07,779
I warned you about this,
Peter.

685
01:15:07,849 --> 01:15:10,477
No, you wanted
to play the game.

686
01:15:12,186 --> 01:15:15,747
What, are you crying? You don't cry,
all right? You keep your chin up.

687
01:15:15,823 --> 01:15:18,417
Keep your chin up.

688
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:21,428
Crying never helped anybody
do anything, okay?

689
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:25,927
You have a problem,
you face it like a man.

690
01:15:35,543 --> 01:15:37,636
I'm sorry.

691
01:15:37,712 --> 01:15:41,910
Twenty-six years buried in the jungle
and I still became my father.

692
01:15:41,983 --> 01:15:43,814
It's okay.
Come here. I'm sorry.

693
01:15:43,885 --> 01:15:45,910
Hey.
It's all right.

694
01:15:45,987 --> 01:15:49,047
Remember what you told me?
It's all right to be afraid.

695
01:15:49,123 --> 01:15:51,591
It's not that.

696
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:54,184
What is it?

697
01:16:05,807 --> 01:16:08,207
Okay. Ready?

698
01:16:11,646 --> 01:16:16,640
Don't worry. We're gonna have you turned
back into your old self in no time flat.

699
01:16:16,718 --> 01:16:19,346
'Cause we're gonna go in here,
and together...

700
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,945
we're gonna sit down,
we're gonna finish that game...

701
01:16:22,023 --> 01:16:25,015
no matter what.

702
01:16:37,004 --> 01:16:39,996
Suddenly, I feel right at home.

703
01:17:12,273 --> 01:17:14,434
Lorraine, this is Carl.

704
01:17:14,509 --> 01:17:18,912
I know who's behind this. I'm headin'
to the Parrish place. Gimme backup.

705
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:28,716
Wait!

706
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:31,623
- Now what?
- Stop!

707
01:17:31,692 --> 01:17:33,626
Wait, stop!

708
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:38,530
Is there a problem, ma'am?

709
01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:41,295
- Can I have a ride home?
- Where do you live?

710
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:44,361
Jefferson Street.
The old Parrish place.

711
01:17:44,438 --> 01:17:46,963
Do you have children?
A boy and a girl?

712
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:51,034
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- Get in. I'II explain it on the way.

713
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:23,102
Fine! Take it!

714
01:18:23,177 --> 01:18:25,270
We gotta get to that house.

715
01:18:30,985 --> 01:18:33,419
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
- No.

716
01:18:33,487 --> 01:18:36,615
I grew up in this.
It's out there that scares me.

717
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:39,893
Okay, it's my turn.

718
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:42,088
If you roll a 12, you win.

719
01:18:44,232 --> 01:18:46,792
Okay, ready? Here I go.

720
01:18:51,372 --> 01:18:52,361
It's okay.

721
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,170
"Every month at the quarter moon...

722
01:18:55,243 --> 01:18:57,871

01:18:57,945 --> 01:18:59,936

724
01:19:00,014 --> 01:19:03,108
Monsoon.
Well, at least we're inside.

725
01:19:05,686 --> 01:19:07,483
Yeah, right.

726
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,906
Well, a little rain
never hurt anybody.

727
01:19:31,979 --> 01:19:34,846
Yeah, but a lot could kill you.

728
01:19:44,258 --> 01:19:46,988
- What do we do now?
- We get to higher ground!

729
01:19:47,061 --> 01:19:50,224
- Okay.
- Come on! Stay together!

730
01:20:06,314 --> 01:20:07,406
You all right?

731
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:12,585
Alan. What is that?

732
01:20:14,021 --> 01:20:17,422
Swim! Go! Go!

733
01:20:23,364 --> 01:20:24,888
Swim fast! Move!

734
01:20:27,668 --> 01:20:29,863
Keep goin'!

735
01:20:31,472 --> 01:20:34,464
Get on the table!
Peter, get out of the water!

736
01:20:38,145 --> 01:20:39,635
On the chandelier!

737
01:20:48,889 --> 01:20:50,618
Come on, Sarah.

738
01:21:04,672 --> 01:21:06,640
Hang on, Sarah!

739
01:21:10,077 --> 01:21:11,510
Are you okay?

740
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:27,152
Where is he?

741
01:21:40,274 --> 01:21:43,710
Ma'am, step back and let me handle this,
please. It's probably nothing.

742
01:21:43,778 --> 01:21:45,837
They probably left the TV
on too loud.

743
01:21:50,684 --> 01:21:53,312
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?

744
01:22:13,307 --> 01:22:14,831
Give me your hand.

745
01:22:19,313 --> 01:22:21,873
- Grab my hand!
- I got it! No!

746
01:22:43,337 --> 01:22:46,033
Take the game.
Here you go.

747
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,614
- You okay?
- Yeah.

748
01:23:00,321 --> 01:23:02,949
Alan, you wrestled
an alligator for me.

749
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,589
It was a crocodile.

750
01:23:07,661 --> 01:23:11,529
Alligators don't have
that little fringe on their hind leg.

751
01:23:12,633 --> 01:23:14,260
Come on.

752
01:23:17,438 --> 01:23:19,633
My mistake.

753
01:23:39,593 --> 01:23:40,787
Come on.

754
01:23:46,066 --> 01:23:48,762
Okay, it's my turn.

755
01:23:48,836 --> 01:23:53,273
I've got it. Colonel Mustard
in the library with a wrench.

756
01:23:56,577 --> 01:23:58,101
Clue.

757

759
01:24:21,235 --> 01:24:23,829
- Help me.
- Okay. Stay calm.

760
01:24:23,904 --> 01:24:24,962
Don't struggle.

761
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:27,030
- Stay calm.
- I'm calm.

762
01:24:28,209 --> 01:24:30,268
- Grab on!
- Pull.

763
01:24:30,344 --> 01:24:32,278
Okay, I got it.

764
01:24:32,346 --> 01:24:34,143
Pull!

765
01:24:37,484 --> 01:24:40,009
Stay calm!

766
01:24:40,087 --> 01:24:41,281
Come on.

767
01:24:42,323 --> 01:24:45,121
Oh, good!

768
01:24:47,361 --> 01:24:49,625
I got you.

769
01:24:49,697 --> 01:24:51,995
Stop giving me things
that come apart!

770
01:24:54,034 --> 01:24:57,629
- "There is a lesson..."
- All right.

771
01:25:00,474 --> 01:25:02,237
"There is a lesson
you will learn:

772
01:25:03,177 --> 01:25:04,303
I got you.

773
01:25:06,981 --> 01:25:09,643
Sometimes you must
go back a turn."

774
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,754
- Did I hurt you?
- Oh, no.

775
01:25:14,822 --> 01:25:16,756
Oh, dear.

776
01:25:16,824 --> 01:25:19,918
Oh, thank you, Judy.
Thank you.

777
01:25:19,994 --> 01:25:21,723
That was quick thinking.

778
01:25:21,795 --> 01:25:24,593
Sarah and I would like
to get out of the floor...

779
01:25:24,665 --> 01:25:26,599
so it's your turn, Peter.

780
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:28,294
Okay.

781
01:25:35,309 --> 01:25:37,334
I thought I lost you again.

782
01:25:37,411 --> 01:25:39,709
Thanks for stickin' around
this time.

783
01:25:45,319 --> 01:25:47,947
"Need a hand
while you just wait...

784
01:25:48,022 --> 01:25:51,924
we'll help you out,
we each have eight."

785
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:03,265
- What's that? What is it?
- Nothing.

786
01:26:03,337 --> 01:26:04,861
You don't go "Waah!"
For nothing.

787
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:08,865
- Oh, my.
- Peter!

788
01:26:08,942 --> 01:26:11,911
My dad kept an ax
in the woodshed. Get it.

789
01:26:11,979 --> 01:26:14,072
- Okay.
- Hurry! Go, go, go!

790
01:27:23,784 --> 01:27:26,685
Aunt Nora, it's me, Peter.

791
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:32,524
Oh, God!

792
01:27:32,593 --> 01:27:35,721
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'll explain later.

793
01:27:36,697 --> 01:27:38,221
- What?
- It's your turn.

794
01:27:38,298 --> 01:27:41,233
- You can finish if you roll a 7.
- I can't roll!

795
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:44,065
Put the dice in your mouth...

796
01:27:44,138 --> 01:27:46,231
Bring the game!
Hurry!

797
01:28:00,654 --> 01:28:03,919
- Judy, are you okay?
- I'm fine. Help them.

798
01:28:07,628 --> 01:28:09,926
Come on, Judy.

799
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,733
Gimme the dice!

800
01:28:23,811 --> 01:28:25,836
"You're almost there
with much at stake...

801
01:28:26,814 --> 01:28:29,078
but now the ground
begins to quake."

802
01:28:32,619 --> 01:28:34,519
- Oh, my God!
- What?

803
01:28:39,993 --> 01:28:42,757
I wish Mom and Dad were here.

804
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:44,764
So do I.

805
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:58,906
Our only chance is if
we finish the game!

806
01:28:58,979 --> 01:29:00,879
It's your turn!

807
01:29:00,948 --> 01:29:02,438
Oh, my God.

808
01:29:15,662 --> 01:29:19,063
- Get the game! The game!
- No, I won't let you go!

809
01:29:48,161 --> 01:29:49,753
Don't move!

810
01:29:54,234 --> 01:29:55,861
Stand up.

811
01:30:00,874 --> 01:30:02,705
What's in your hand?

812
01:30:05,178 --> 01:30:06,372
Drop it.

813
01:30:16,557 --> 01:30:18,650
End of the line, Sonny Jim.

814
01:30:18,725 --> 01:30:21,455
Game's up.
Stop running.

815
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:24,856
No.

816
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:30,166
- Aren't you afraid?
- I'm terrified.

817
01:30:31,305 --> 01:30:32,966
But my father told me...

818
01:30:34,174 --> 01:30:36,642
you should always face
what you're afraid of.

819
01:30:41,381 --> 01:30:45,010
Good lad.
You're finally acting like a man.

820
01:30:46,987 --> 01:30:48,386
Any last words?

821
01:30:58,799 --> 01:31:00,733
Jumanji.

822
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,164
No, Alan!

823
01:32:38,031 --> 01:32:39,862
Forgot my speech notes.

824
01:32:44,071 --> 01:32:47,268
I'm so glad you're back.

825
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:49,274
I've only been gone
five minutes.

826
01:32:51,144 --> 01:32:53,840
It seems like
a lot longer to me.

827
01:32:55,415 --> 01:32:58,441
I thought you told me you were never
gonna talk to me again.

828
01:33:02,255 --> 01:33:04,450
Whatever I said, Dad...

829
01:33:04,524 --> 01:33:06,856
I'm sorry.

830
01:33:09,229 --> 01:33:13,325
Look, Alan, I was angry.

831
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,528
I'm sorry too. I'm sorry.

832
01:33:21,274 --> 01:33:25,301
You don't have to go to Cliffside
if you don't want to.

833
01:33:28,348 --> 01:33:31,806
Let's talk it over tomorrow,
man-to-man.

834
01:33:34,521 --> 01:33:36,546
How about father-to-son?

835
01:33:37,924 --> 01:33:40,586
All right.

836
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:43,959
Hey, I gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honor.

837
01:33:46,133 --> 01:33:47,566
Dad?

838
01:33:51,605 --> 01:33:55,939
Back in 196...
I mean, today in the factory...

839
01:33:56,009 --> 01:33:58,273
it wasn't
Carl Bentley's fault.

840
01:33:58,345 --> 01:34:01,508
I put the shoe
on the conveyor belt.

841
01:34:03,784 --> 01:34:06,275
I'm glad you told me, son.

842
01:34:06,353 --> 01:34:08,287
Thanks.

843
01:34:09,422 --> 01:34:11,356
Bye, Dad.

844
01:34:11,424 --> 01:34:13,358
Good-bye.

845
01:34:23,203 --> 01:34:25,137
Holy smokes!
Judy and Peter!

846
01:34:27,374 --> 01:34:29,308
They're not there.

847
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:32,903
It's 1969.

848
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:35,607
They don't even exist yet.

849
01:35:05,312 --> 01:35:08,076
I'm starting to forget
what it's like to be a grown-up.

850
01:35:08,148 --> 01:35:11,982
That's okay. As long as
we don't forget each other.

851
01:35:12,052 --> 01:35:13,917
Or Judy and Peter.

852
01:35:15,455 --> 01:35:18,083
Alan, there's something
I've been wanting to do...

853
01:35:19,159 --> 01:35:22,788
and I better do it
before I feel too much like a kid.

854
01:35:41,882 --> 01:35:45,943
They probably don't teach
driver training in the sixth grade, huh?

855
01:35:48,021 --> 01:35:50,690
<i>God and sinners reconciled</i>

856
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:51,987
<i>God and sinners reconciled</i>

857
01:35:52,058 --> 01:35:56,085
<i>Joyful all ye nations rise</i>

858
01:35:56,162 --> 01:36:00,963
<i>Join the triumph of the skies</i>

859
01:36:01,034 --> 01:36:04,834
Merry Christmas.
Want to try one of these?

860
01:36:04,905 --> 01:36:08,568
<i>Christ is born in Bethlehem</i>

861
01:36:08,642 --> 01:36:12,203
<i>Hark, he herald angels sing</i>

862
01:36:12,279 --> 01:36:16,010
No, Dad. It's a new cross-trainer.
It's doing fabulous.

863
01:36:16,082 --> 01:36:18,744
- It's not a bra. It's a shoe.
- Honey, they're here.

864
01:36:18,818 --> 01:36:22,254
Dad, I gotta run. Merry Christmas.
We'll pick you up at the airport.

865
01:36:22,322 --> 01:36:25,621
You'll be the best
Christmas gift of all. Bye-bye.

866
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:26,989
- They're here.
- Come on.

867
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:28,493
Let's go.

868
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:32,664
Pardon me.

869
01:36:32,732 --> 01:36:35,223
- Jim, glad you could make it.
- Thanks.

870
01:36:35,302 --> 01:36:37,827
- This is my wife, Martha.
- Hi, Martha. This is Sarah.

871
01:36:37,904 --> 01:36:40,031
- Hi, Sarah.
- Where are the kids?

872
01:36:40,941 --> 01:36:42,875
Oh, my God, there they are.

873
01:36:44,077 --> 01:36:45,544
How'd you know?

874
01:36:45,612 --> 01:36:49,070
A guess. A guess, of course.
They're your kids.

875
01:36:49,149 --> 01:36:51,242
You're right.
These are our children.

876
01:36:51,318 --> 01:36:54,617
Judy and Peter. Kids, say hi
to Mr. And Mrs. Parrish.

877
01:36:54,688 --> 01:36:57,885
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

878
01:36:59,192 --> 01:37:02,127
You're just like
we remembered you.

879
01:37:04,364 --> 01:37:06,889
I feel like we know
so much about them...

880
01:37:06,967 --> 01:37:08,798
because, you know...

881
01:37:08,868 --> 01:37:11,302
- You've told Alan so much about them.
- And I told her.

882
01:37:11,371 --> 01:37:13,999
- Yeah.
- I'll go get the presents.

883
01:37:14,074 --> 01:37:15,564
Sure, honey.

884
01:37:15,642 --> 01:37:17,576
Well, we love children.

885
01:37:17,644 --> 01:37:20,306
- Merry Christmas.
- Cool!

886
01:37:23,316 --> 01:37:26,342
- When can you start?
- Martha and I were thinking...

887
01:37:26,419 --> 01:37:29,445
of taking a little skiing holiday
up in the Canadian Rockies.

888
01:37:29,522 --> 01:37:30,750
No!

889
01:37:33,026 --> 01:37:34,084
Sorry.

890
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:36,526
We... We just...

891
01:37:36,596 --> 01:37:39,724
Need you to get that marketing
done on the new line pronto.

892
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:43,362
No problem.
I could probably start next week.

893
01:37:43,436 --> 01:37:44,562
That'd be great.

894
01:37:44,637 --> 01:37:48,437
Let me introduce you to the rest of
the folks you'll be working with.

895
01:37:48,508 --> 01:37:51,136
Come on in.
Our house was your house.

896
01:37:51,211 --> 01:37:53,509
Is, anytime you like.

897
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:56,947
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>
We wish you a merry Christmas

898
01:37:57,017 --> 01:38:02,284
<i>We wish you a merry Christmas</i>
and a happy New Year
