From the Federal Theatre.

Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got an audience.

The trick is to start to build
right from the back of your throat.

Okay.

71
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,380

I'm leaving, Annie.

73
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
I'm going back to Chicago.

74
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,510
I'm sorry, Annie.

76
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,890
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

77
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,900
You gotta think of yourself now.

78
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,730
You should try out for that part.

79
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,820
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

80
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,780
Every time you reach out
for something you care about...

81
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,570
fate comes along and snatches it away.

82
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,240
But not this time, Annie.

83
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,370
Not this time.

84
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,630
-Oh, hello, Mr Weston.
-Oh, jeez.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,750
Look, miss, I told you already,
call my office.

86
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,750
Leave your résumé with my secretary.

87
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,920
Now, why would I want to do that
when we can talk about it in person?

88
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,590
Because that's what a smart girl would do.

89
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,140
But I already sent you my résumé.
You returned it unopened.

90
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,260
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

91
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,970
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

92
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,270
Jesus, you don't give up, do you?

93
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,890
Mr Weston, I know this role backwards.

94
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,940
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just
gave the part to someone else.

95
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm sorry, kid. The play is cast.

96
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,150
I know times are tough.

97
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,240
You want my advice?

98
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,610
Use what you got. You're not bad-looking.

99
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,320
A girl like you doesn't have to starve.

100
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,040
There's a new place. It just opened.

101
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,250
Now listen, princess, this gig
ain't the Palace, you understand?

102
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,300
Ask for Kenny K. Tell him I sent you.

103
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,010
Just play the date, take the money...

104
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,970

You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

113

Come on, fellows, you know the deal.

114
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,470
We agreed to push Maureen's start date...

115
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,140
so she could get her teeth fixed.

116
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,020
It's not the principle of the thing,
it's the money.

Carl, you've been in production
for over two months.

Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...

What ship?

121
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,360

to be shooting on the back lot.

Yes, I understand that.

making that film anymore...

and I'll tell you why.

The script has been rewritten.

I've come into possession of a map.

129
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,630
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

130

A place that was thought to exist
only in myth.

Whoa, Carl, slow down.

133
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,680
Is he asking for more money?

134
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,350
He's asking us to fund a wild-goose chase.

135
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,850
I'm talking about a primitive world
never before seen by man.

136
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,020
The ruins of an entire civilisation.

The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

Boobies?

141
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,740
Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms.

142
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,660
In my experience,
people only go to these films...

143
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,040
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

You think they asked De Mille if he
would waste his time on nudie shots?

146
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,670
No! They respected the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

147
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,170
Not that you'd know what that means,
you cheap lowlife!

He's had a lot of near-success.

-lNVESTOR 2: He's washed up.

161
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,220
It's all over town.

162
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,300
This jumped-up little turd's
gonna bankrupt us.

163
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,180
The animal footage has value.

164
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,680
Sure. Universal are desperate
for stock footage.

165
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,140
Then sell it! Scrap the picture.

166
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,600
We got to retrieve something
from this debacle.

167
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,070
Get him back in.

168
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,730
Mr Denham.

169
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,910
I want the cast and crew on the ship
within the hour.

170
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,110
No, Carl, you can't do this.

171
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,370
Tell them the studio pressured us
into an early departure.

172
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,450
-It's not ethical!
-What are they gonna do, sue me?

173
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,620
They can get in line.

174
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,120
I'm not gonna let them kill my film.

175
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,620
PRESTON: You realise that none of
the camera equipment is on board?

176
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,500
We have no permits, no visas.

177
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,210
CARL: That's why I have you, Preston.

178
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,380
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

179
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,380
In fact, we have no currency of any kind.

180
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,550
He's there.

181
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,340
-Get in there.
-Who's gonna pay for the ship?

182
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,510
Get in.

183
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,970
-You get out of there! Come here!
-Step on it! Step on it!

184
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Get out! You're finished, Denham!

185
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,310
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice at this.

186
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,940
I'm real good at crapping the crappers.

187
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,280
PRESTON: Red Label, 80% proof, to be
packed in a crate marked "lemonade."

188
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,450
CARL: You got it.

189
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,860
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

190
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,240
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

191
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,910
She doesn't wanna be in this picture.

192
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,710
-Maureen pulled out.
-She pulled out?

193
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,870
Yesterday. I told you.

194
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,580
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

195
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,630
That's what you told her.

196
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,710
Yeah, but we're not shooting in Singapore.

197
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,090
God damn it, Preston, all you had to
do was look her in the eye and lie.

198
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,890
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

199
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,390
She's unavailable.

200
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,260
CARL: Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

201
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
PRESTON: You'll never get her
into a size four.

202
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,270
You gotta get a girl
that'll fit into Maureen's costumes.

203
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,860
Fay's a size four.

204
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,440
Yes, she is,
but she's doing a picture with RKO.

205
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,490
Cooper, huh?

206
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,030
I might have known.

207
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,780
PRESTON: You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

208
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,330
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

209
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,830
-Not an option.
-Carl.

210
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,370
I said I'd find a girl.

211
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,710
For God's sake, Preston, think like a winner!

212
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,620
Call Jack. I need that goddamn screenplay!

213
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,540
Defeat is always momentary.

214
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,570
What?

215
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,160
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

216
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,750
Excuse me.

217
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,290
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

218
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,510
Vaudeville, huh?

219
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,640
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

220
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,510
If you don't kill them fast, they kill you.

221
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,010
Mr Denham...

222
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,060
I want you to know...

223
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,940
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers.

224
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,850
Or, for that matter...

225
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,480
taking things that don't belong to me.

226
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,480
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

227
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,480
It's just that I haven't been paid in a while.

228
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,990
That's awful.
Anyway, Ann.... May I call you Ann?

229
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,450
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

230
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,000
No, no. Oh, God, no.

231
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,620
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

232
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,790
I'm not that type of person at all.

233
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,540
What type of person are you?

234
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,590
I'm someone you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

235
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,720
Believe me, I am on the level.
No funny business. Please sit down.

236
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,340
Please. Please.

237
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,350
Okay.

238
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,890
Ann, I want you to imagine...

239
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,680
a handsome explorer bound for the Far East.

240
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,020
You're filming in the Far East?

241
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,560
Singapore.

242
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,400
On board ship, he meets a mysterious girl.

243
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,320
She's beautiful, she's fragile, haunted.

244
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,070
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...

245
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,030
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

246
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,330
It's as if her whole life
has been a prelude to this moment...

247
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,040
this fateful meeting that changes everything.

248
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,710
And sure enough,
against her better judgement....

249
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,460
She falls in love.

250
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Yes.

251
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,380
But she doesn't trust it.

252
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,510
She's not even sure if she believes in love.

253
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,220
Really?

254
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,770
If she loves someone, it's doomed.

255
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,230
Why is that?

256
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,230
Good things never last, Mr Denham.

257
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,320
So you're interested.
Good. That's settled, then.

258
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,900
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.

259
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,410
-Well, I really--
-Ann, I'm telling you...

260
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,820
you're perfect. Look at you.

261
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,910
You're the saddest girl I've ever met.

262
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,080
You're gonna make them weep, Ann.
You're gonna break their hearts.

263
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,420
See, that's where you're wrong, Mr Denham.

264
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,080
I make people laugh, that's what I do.

265
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,750
Good luck with your picture.

266
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,130
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

267
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,590
I'm offering you money.

268
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,340
Adventure, fame, the thrill of
a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

269
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,510
You want to read a script?

270
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft
as we speak.

271
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,020
Jack Driscoll?

272
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,440
Sure. Why?

273
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,480
Wait. You know him?

274
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,110
No, not personally. I've seen his plays.

275
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,190
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

276
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,280
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

277
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,740
He said to me, "Carl...

278
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,160
"somewhere out there
is a woman born to play this role."

279
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,620
And as soon as I saw you, I knew.

280
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,290
Knew what?

281
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,540
It was always going to be you.

282
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,590
(SHlP HORN BLOWlNG)

283
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,050
CARL: How much do I owe you?
DRlVER: Make it a quarter.

284
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,720
Keep the change.

285
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,560
Is this the moving picture ship?

286
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,560
Not exactly.

287
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,060
It's actually this one over here.

288
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,740
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

289
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,660
-ls this all of the equipment?
-Yeah.

290
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,830
-This is all of it?
-Yeah.

291
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,490
-We're taking the Bell & Howell?
-Yeah.

292
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,290
-Good. You got all the lenses?
-Sure.

293
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,910
-PRESTON: Carl!
-Yes!

294
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,330
Get it on board, fellows, come on.

295
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,130
It's bad, it's bad.

296
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,130
They're on their way. I've just had word.

297
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,300
-Who?
-Men in uniform.

298
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,470
The studio called the cops.

299
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,970
Englehorn! Cast off!

300
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,970
Hoist up the mainsail, raise the anchor...

301
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
whatever the hell it is you do.
We gotta leave!

302
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,810
I cannot do that.

303
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,140
We are waiting on the manifest.

304
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,690
What? Who? English, please.

305
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,810
Paperwork, Mr Denham.

306
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,570
I'll give you another $1,000 to leave now.

307
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,030
You haven't given me the first $1,000 yet.

308
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,280
Can we talk about this later?

309
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,160
Can't you see
we're in the company of a VlP guest?

310
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,290
Ma'am.

311
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,540
Ann Darrow.

312
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,710
So you are ready for this voyage,
Miss Darrow?

313
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,090
Sure.

314
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,210
Nervous?

315
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,760
Nervous? No.

316
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,050
Why? Should I be?

317

who would take such a risk.

Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?

Wonderful idea. Thank you, Preston.

Hi. My name is Preston. Carl's assistant.

322
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,200
$2,000. It's a deal. Will you take a cheque?

323
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,530
Do I have a choice?

Excuse me, fellows.

please don't hesitate to ask.

Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me.

Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

Say I got depressed and committed suicide.

330

Say I stuck my head down the toilet.

-You want one?
-No. I can't stay, Carl.

Jack, this is 15 pages.

336
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,290
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages there, Carl.

337
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,370
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

338

You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

No, Jack, you can't do this to me.
I have a beginning...

340
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,630
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

All right, fine. We might as well settle up.

Sounds great.

God, I'm sorry. It'll just take a sec.

358
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,440
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me when you get back.

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,830
It's nice to meet you, too, Miss Darrow.

476
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,140
Good Christ!

477
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,160
CARL: She's standing at the railing.
She doesn't know it yet...

478
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,330
(TYPEWRlTER CLACKlNG)

479
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,910
but they are sailing towards disaster.
You got that?

480
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,830
JACK: Okay, so she turns...

481
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,000
the first mate is staggering towards her.

482
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,960
There's a knife sticking out of his back.

483
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,970
Wait a sec. We're killing off the first mate?

484
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,680
That's assuming
she knows who the first mate is.

485
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,600
Come on, Jack. It was an honest mistake.

486
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,220
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened to anyone.

487
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,890
I was joking, Carl.

488
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,270
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

489
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,110
And that's when she sees it.

490
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,650
Sees what?

491
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,030
What?

492
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,910
The island.

493
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,870
We're filming on an island now?
When did this happen?

494
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,210
Jack, keep your voice down.

495
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,250
I don't want the crew getting spooked.

496
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

497
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,970
All right. It has a local name...

498
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,550
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

499
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,340
They call it Skull lsland.

500
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,140
Did you get that?

501
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,260
What's wrong with this place?

502
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,060
There's nothing officially wrong with it.

503
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,640
Because, technically,
it hasn't been discovered yet.

504
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,020
Okay. All right.

505
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,490
So we arrive at this place.

506
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,280
S...

507
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,110
K...

508
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,530
U...

509
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,740
L...

510
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,490
L...

511
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,330
Island.

512
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,760
All right, everyone, from the top!
And action!

513
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,970
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

514
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,640
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

515
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,180
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships, do you?

516
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,220
No, they're a nuisance.

517
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,940
-Well, I'll try not to be.
-Just being around is trouble.

518
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Cut!

519
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,780
It's great.

520
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,120
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

521
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,120
That was very natural. I felt moved.

522
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,750
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

523
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,620
It was pure effluence.

524
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,460
I beefed up the banter.

525
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,670
Try to resist that impulse.

526
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,960
It's just a little bit of humour, bud.

527
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,500
What are you, a Bolshevik or something?

528
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,800
Actors.

529
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,220
Travel the world,
but all they ever see is a mirror.

530
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,020
Good legs.

531
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,270
Sea legs. Well, you know, sea legs.

532
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Yeah.

533
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,570
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

534
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,950
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

535
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,450
About the scene today with you and Bruce--

536
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,330
I know it wasn't what you wrote...

537
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:46,460
but Mr Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...

538
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,750
he must ignore her.

539
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,670
And if things turn really hostile, then....

540
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,750
No?

541
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,550
Interesting theory.

542
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
I know. I should have....

543
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,680
It wasn't what I had intended, but--

544
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,260
I'm sorry. I was....

545
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,350
And you made it your own.

546
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,810
I was nervous.

547
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,640
It was funny, actually. You were funny.

548
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,850
Please don't say another word. Good night.

549
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,350
Miss Darrow.

550
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,190
You don't have to be nervous.

551
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,040
Thank you.

552
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,590
Let's take it....

553
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,960
Would you please....
We're trying to shoot a scene.

554
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:40,670
-Okay.
-Thank you.

555
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,220
Okay, again.

556
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,940
CARL: We're close. Turn southwest.

557
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,610
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

558
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,070
It takes us way outside the shipping lanes.

559
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,610
I won't sail blind in these waters.

560
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,910
I'll make it worth your while.

561
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,240
There's nothing out there.

562
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,370
Well, then you've nothing to lose.

563
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,390
If someone were to tell you this
ship was headed for Singapore...

564
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,600
what would you say?

565
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,470
I would say they're full of it, Mr Hayes.

566
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,980
Well, we turned southwest last night.

567
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,810
Gentlemen, please.

568
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,770
-We're not looking for trouble.
-No.

569
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,480
You're looking for something else.

570
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,280
Yes, we are.

571
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,330
We're going to find Skull lsland.

572
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,740
Find it, film it, and show it to the world.

573
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,500
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

574
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,130
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

575
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,050
What do you mean?

576
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,380
Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes
were working our passage...

577
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,010
on a Norwegian bark.

578
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,930
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

579
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,010
He'd been drifting for days.

580
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,510
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

581
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,020
An island hidden in fog.

582
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,060
He spoke of a huge wall...

583
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,110
built so long ago...

584
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,650
no one knew who'd made it.

585
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,780
A wall 100 foot high...

586
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,860
as strong today as it was ages ago.

587
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,660
Why'd they build the wall?

588
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,750
Well, the castaway, he spoke of a creature...

589
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,290
neither beast nor man...

590
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,050
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

591
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,460
A lion or a tiger.

592
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,720
A man-eater.
That's how all these stories start.

593
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,590
What else did he say?

594
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,050
Nothing.

595
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,850
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

596
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,480
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do better than that.

597
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,980
Monsters belong in B movies.

598
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,060
If you find this place...

599
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,020
if you go ashore with your friends
and your cameras...

600
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,860
you won't come back.

601
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,360
Just as long as you understand that.

602
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,100
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

603
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,940
You're writing a stage comedy?

604
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,940
I'm writing it for you.

605
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,980
Why would you do that?

606
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,780
-Why would I write a play for you?
-Yes.

607
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,070
Isn't it obvious?

608
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,120
Not to me.

609
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,160
Well...

610
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,500
it's in the subtext.

611
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,460
I guess I must have missed it.

612
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,380
It's not about words.

613
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,950
(MORSE CODE BEEPlNG)

614
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,500
Message for you, Captain.

615
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,520
What's going on?

616
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,150
Hayes, why are we changing course?

617
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,980
-Englehorn, you can't just--
-Outside.

618
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:09,660
There's a warrant out for your arrest.

619
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,620
Did you know that?

620
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,660
I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon.

621
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,170
Another week. I haven't got a film yet.

622
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,210
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

623
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,550
No, Denham. You risked everything I have.

624
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,720
What do you want?

625
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,050
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

626
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,050
I want you off my ship.

627
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,140
Set a course for Rangoon, Mr Hayes.

628
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,190
I'm finished.

629
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,530
It's over for me, Jack.

630
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,780
How'd you think this would end, Carl?

631
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,920
Check our position. Use the stars.

632
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,720
There are no stars, Captain.

633
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,560
JACK: What is that?

634
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,610
-What?
-That.

635
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,240
That right there.

636
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,070
I don't know. What is it? A coffee stain?
