7
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,732

A land serene

18
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:22,940
A crystal moon

19
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:29,484
It's only forever

20
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,617
It's not long at all

21
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:37,430
The lost and the lonely

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,725
That's underground

23
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:46,137
Underground

24
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,986
Give me the child.

25
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,551
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...

26
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:10,222
I have fought my way to the castle
beyond the Goblin City...

27
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,325
to take back the child
that you have stolen.

28
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:18,563
For my will
is as strong as yours...

29
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:22,165
and my kingdom is as great--

30
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:32,047
For my will is as strong as yours,
my kingdom as great--

31
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,417
Damn.

32
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:37,015
Oh, I can never remember that line.

33
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:41,759
"You have no power over me."

34
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:48,160
Oh, Merlin.

35
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,432
Oh, no, Merlin.
I don't believe it. It's 7:00!

36
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:58,809
Come on. Come on!

37
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,555
No one can blame you

38
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,059
For walking away

39
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:22,160
But too much rejection

40
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:27,101
No love injection

41
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:29,166
Life can be easy

42
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:34,476
It's not always swell

43
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:40,453
Don't tell me truth hurts
little girl

44
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,149
'Cause it hurts like hell

45
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:48,254
Oh, it's not tair!

46
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,688
Oh, really.

47
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,291
- I'm sorry.
- Don't stand in the rain. Come on.

48
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:56,461
All right. Come on, Merlin.

49
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:58,505
- Come on.
- Not the dog.

50
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:00,803
- But it's pouring.
- Go on, into the garage.

51
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:05,977
Go on, Merlin.
Go into the garage.

52
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,480
Go.

53
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:13,387
- Sarah, you're an hour late.
- I said I was sorry!

54
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:15,422
Please let me finish.

55
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,481
- Your f ather and I go out rarely.
- You go out every single weekend.

56
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:22,552
I ask you to baby-sit only it it
won't interfere with your plans.

57
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,361
You don't know what my plans are.
You don't even ask me anymore.

58
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:29,665
I assume you'd tell me you had a date.
I'd like it it you had a date.

59
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:33,798
- You should have dates at your age.
- Sarah, you're home.

60
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,470
- We were worried about you.
- I can't do anything right, can I?

61
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:42,245
She treats me like a wicked stepmother
in a tairy story no matter what I say.

62
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:43,806
I'll talk to her.

63
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,237
Through dangers untold...

64
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,664
and hardships unnumbered...

65
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,406
I have fought my way here
to the castle...

66
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,505
beyond the Goblin City...

67
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:19,350
to take back the child...

68
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,184
that you have stolen.

69
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:28,726
- Can I talk to you?
- There's nothing to talk about!

70
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:30,423
Hurry. You're gonna be late.

71
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,932
Listen, we ted Toby
and put him to bed.

72
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,094
We do have to leave now,
but we'll be back around midnight.

73
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,534
You really wanted
to talk to me, didn't you?

74
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,372
Practically broke down the door.

75
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:47,371
Lancelot!

76
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,611
Someone has been in my room again.

77
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:53,620
I hate that. I hate it!

78
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,625
I hate you. I hate you!

79
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,261
Someone save me, take me away
from this awful place!

80
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:12,502
What do you want?
You want a story, huh?

81
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:14,006
Okay.

82
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,710
Once upon a time
there was a beautitul, young girl...

83
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,943
whose stepmother always
made her stay home with the baby.

84
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:26,418
The baby was a spoiled child
and wanted everything for himself...

85
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,422
and the young girl
was practically a slave.

86
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,525
But what no one knew...

87
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,721
was that the king ot the goblins
had f allen in love with the girl...

88
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,321
and he had given her
certain powers.

89
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,889
So one night...

90
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:43,425
when the baby had been
particularly cruel to her...

91
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,132
she called on the goblins tor help.

92
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:49,209
Listen.

93
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:54,613
"Say your right words, "
the goblins said.

94
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,442
"And we'll take the baby
to the Goblin City...

95
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,216
and you will be tree."

96
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,455
But the girl knew
that the king ot the goblins...

97
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,123
would keep the baby in his castle
torever and ever and ever...

98
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,723
and turn it into a goblin.

99
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,769
So the girl sutfered in silence...

100
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:19,829
until one night, when she was tired
from a day of housework...

101
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:23,673
and she was hurt by the harsh words
of her stepmother...

102
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:25,974
and she could no longer stand it--

103
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:30,614
Oh, all right!

104
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:35,949
Knock it ott. Come on.

105
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:38,218
Stop it!

106
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:40,226
I'll say the words.

107
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:43,457
No, I mustn't. I mustn't say.

108
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,831
I wish--

109
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,959
I wish.

110
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:50,299
- She's going to say it.
- Say what?

111
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,669
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

112
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,674
You shut up.

113
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,540
Listen.
She's going to say the words.

114
00:08:57,611 --> 00:09:00,102
I can bear it no longer!

115
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:04,083
Goblin King, Goblin King,
wherever you may be...

116
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:07,678
take this child of mine
tar away trom me!

117
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,415
- No!
- That's not it.

118
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:16,020
Where'd she learn that rubbish?
It doesn't even start with "I wish."

119
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:19,858
Toby, stop it!

120
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:25,902
I wish I did know what to say
to make the goblins take you away.

121
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:28,771
"I wish the goblins would come
and take you away right now."

122
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,777
That's not hard, is it?

123
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:33,979
I wish--

124
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:36,641
I wish--

125
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:39,618
- Did she say it?
- Shut up!

126
00:09:57,538 --> 00:10:00,564
I wish the goblins would
come and take you away.

127
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,103
Right now.

128
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,598
Toby?

129
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,129
Toby, are you all right?

130
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:40,011
Why aren't you crying?

131
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:10,734
You're him, aren't you?
You're the goblin king.

132
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:13,705
I want my brother back, please,
it it's all the same.

133
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,106
What's said is said.

134
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:18,167
But I didn't mean it.

135
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:20,338
- Oh, you didn't.
- Please.

136
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:21,745
Where is he?

137
00:12:21,815 --> 00:12:24,443
You know very well where he is.

138
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:27,453
Please bring him back. Please.

139
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,614
Sarah...

140
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,818
go back to your room...

141
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:36,488
play with your toys
and your costumes.

142
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:38,497
Forget about the baby.

143
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,132
I can't.

144
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:43,829
I've brought you a gitt.

145
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,930
- What is it?
- It's a crystal.

146
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:49,202
Nothing more.

147
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:51,540
But it you turn it this way...

148
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:53,239
look into it.

149
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,680
It will show you your dreams.

150
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:58,843
But this is not a gitt
tor an ordinary girl...

151
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,854
who takes care
ot a screaming baby.

152
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:05,051
Do you want it?

153
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:10,222
Then forget the baby.

154
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:13,990
I can't.

155
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:18,129
I appreciate what you're trying to do
tor me, but I want my brother back.

156
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:20,139
- He must be so scared.
- Sarah.

157
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,883
Don't dety me.

158
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:41,755
You're no match for me.

159
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:43,922
But I have to
have my brother back.

160
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,134
He's there, in my castle.

161
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,809
Do you still
want to look tor him?

162
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:01,809
Is that the castle
beyond the Goblin City?

163
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:06,012
Turn back, Sarah.
Turn back betore it's too late.

164
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,951
I can't.

165
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:11,047
Don't you understand
that I can't?

166
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,717
What a pity.

167
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:15,993
It doesn't look that f ar.

168
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,294
It's turther than you think.
Time is short.

169
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:28,270
You have 13 hours in which
to solve the labyrinth...

170
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,503
betore your baby brother...

171
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,636
becomes one ot us...

172
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:34,146
torever.

173
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,183
Such a pity.

174
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:41,746
The labyrinth.

175
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,117
It doesn't look that hard.

176
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,086
Well, come on, teet.

177
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:14,483
- Excuse me?
- Oh, excuse me!

178
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,921
Oh, it's you.

179
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,221
Excuse me, but I have to get through
this labyrinth. Can you help me?

180
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,930
Oh, how sweet.

181
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,970
Fifty-seven!

182
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:33,598
- How could you?
- Yeah.

183
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:35,801
Poor thing.

184
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:39,478
You monster. Ow!

185
00:15:40,714 --> 00:15:42,443
It bit me!

186
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:44,780
What did you expect
tairies to do?

187
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:48,982
I thought they did nice things
like granting wishes.

188
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:51,524
Huh? Shows what you know,
don't it?

189
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,693
- Fifty-eight.
- You're horrible.

190
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:56,592
Huh? No, I ain't.

191
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:58,824
I'm Hoggle. Who are you?

192
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:01,698
That's what I thought.

193
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:05,262
Fitty-nine.

194
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,569
Do you know where the door
to the labyrinth is?

195
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:10,075
- Maybe.
- Where is it?

196
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,633
Oh, you little--

197
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:13,441
Sixty!

198
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,812
- I said, where is it?
- Where is what?

199
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,044
- The door.
- What door?

200
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:19,642
It's hopeless asking you anything.

201
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,417
Not it you ask the right questions.

202
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,321
How do I get into the labyrinth?

203
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:32,557
Now that's more like it.

204
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:35,500
You gets in there.

205
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:47,479
You really going in there,
are you?

206
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,547
Yes.

207
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:54,143
I'm afraid I have to.

208
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,737
Cozy, isn't it?

209
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:28,420
Now, would you go lett
or right?

210
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:35,089
- They both look the same.
- Well, you're not gonna get very f ar.

211
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:38,029
- Which way would you go?
- Me?

212
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,588
I wouldn't go either way.

213
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,430
It that's all the help you're
gonna be, you can just leave.

214
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:46,666
You know your problem?
You take too many things for granted.

215
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:49,098
Take this labyrinth--

216
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:52,407
Even if you get to the center,
you'll never get out again.

217
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:56,506
- That's your opinion.
- It's a lot better than yours.

218
00:17:57,684 --> 00:17:59,948
Thanks tor nothing, Hogwart.

219
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:05,189
It's Hoggle!
And don't say I didn't warn you.

220
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:12,682
What do they mean, "labyrinth"?
There aren't any turns or corners.

221
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,125
It just goes on and on.

222
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:23,869
Maybe it doesn't.

223
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:28,803
Maybe I'm just taking it
tor granted that it does.

224
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:19,357
'Allo.

225
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,666
Did you say "hello"?

226
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:31,431
No, I said "'allo,"
but that's close enough.

227
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,065
- You're a worm, aren't you?
- That's right.

228
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:40,170
You don't by any chance
know the way through this labyrinth?

229
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:42,738
Who, me?
No, I'm just a worm.

230
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,415
Come inside, meet the missus.

231
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:50,684
No, thank you, but I have
to solve this labyrinth.

232
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:53,385
But there aren't any turns
or any openings or anything.

233
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,553
It just goes on and on.

234
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,531
You ain't looking right. It's tull
of openings, but you ain't seeing 'em.

235
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,965
- Where are they?
- There's one just across there.

236
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:04,401
It's right in front of ya.

237
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,598
No, there isn't.

238
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:09,471
Come inside and have
a nice cup ot tea.

239
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:13,536
- But there isn't an opening.
- Ot course there is.

240
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:17,174
You try walking through it.
You'll see what I mean.

241
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,342
What?

242
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:19,908
Go on then.

243
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:25,024
That's just wall.
There's no way through.

244
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:27,389
Things are not always
what they seem in this place.

245
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,918
So you can't take anything
tor granted.

246
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,471
Hey!

247
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:42,935
- Hang on.
- Thank you.

248
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,137
- That was incredibly helpful.
- Don't go that way.

249
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:49,011
- What was that?
- I said, don't go that way.

250
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:51,744
Never go that way.

251
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:54,685
Oh. Thanks.

252
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:57,951
If she had kept on
going down that way...

253
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:00,857
she'd had gone straight
to that castle.

254
00:22:11,304 --> 00:22:12,601
Toby.

255
00:22:14,674 --> 00:22:16,608
I'm coming, Toby.

256
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,982
Give me back this!
Go on, get ott me.

257
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:34,223
Stay out of the way.
What are you talking about?

258
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:36,228
Walk, walk, walk.

259
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,021
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?

260
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:03,646
- The babe with the power.
- What power?

261
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:05,315
- The power ot voodoo.
- Who do?

262
00:23:05,392 --> 00:23:06,450
- You do.
- Do what?

263
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:09,290
Remind me ot the babe.

264
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:11,990
Quiet! A goblin babe.

265
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:17,268
Well?

266
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:23,974
I saw my baby

267
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:28,003
Crying hard as babe could cry

268
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:30,481
What could I do

269
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,280
My baby's love had gone

270
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:37,289
And left my baby blue

271
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:39,120
Nobody knew

272
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,022
What kind of magic spell to use

273
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:47,123
Slime and snails

274
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,498
Or a puppy dog's tail

275
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,332
Thunder or lightning

276
00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:52,803
And baby said

277
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:56,642
- Dance, magic
- Dance, magic, dance

278
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,735
- Dance, magic, dance
- Dance, magic, dance

279
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,246
Put that baby spell on me

280
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:05,481
- Jump, magic, jump
- Jump, magic, jump

281
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:09,880
Put that magic jump on me

282
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:12,322
Slap that baby
Make him free

283
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,475
Hey, what goes on?

284
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:38,841
Your mother is an aardvark!

285
00:24:56,903 --> 00:24:59,770
In 9 hours and 23 minutes...

286
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,773
you'll be mine.

287
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:10,480
I saw my baby

288
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,112
Trying hard as babe could fry

289
00:25:15,188 --> 00:25:17,122
What could I do

290
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,886
My baby's fun had gone

291
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:23,759
And left my baby blue

292
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,958
Nobody knew

293
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:31,697
What kind of magic spells to use

294
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:33,762
Slime and snails

295
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,070
Puppy dog's tails

296
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:38,076
Thunder or lightning

297
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:39,372
Then baby said

298
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,012
- Dance, magic, dance
- Dance, magic, dance

299
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:47,784
Put that baby spell on me

300
00:25:49,622 --> 00:25:52,614
- Jump, magic, jump
- Jump, magic, jump

301
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,456
Put that magic jump on me

302
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:58,759
Slap that baby
Make him free

303
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:01,198
- Dance, magic, dance
- Dance, magic, dance

304
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:10,535
Jump, magic, jump

305
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:14,974
Put that baby spell on me

306
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,763
- You got it?
- I got it.

307
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,302
- Good.
- Shh!

308
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:52,011
Someone has been
changing my marks.

309
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:55,282
What a horrible place this is.
It's not tair!

310
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:57,915
That's right. It's not f air.

311
00:26:59,392 --> 00:27:01,121
But that's only half ot it.

312
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:06,761
- This was a dead end a minute ago.
- No, that's the dead end behind you.

313
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:14,535
It keeps changing.
What am I supposed to do?

314
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:17,599
The only way out ot here
is to try one of these doors.

315
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,578
One ot them leads to the castle
at the center ot the labyrinth.

316
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:23,013
- And the other one leads to...
- Boom-boom-ba-boom.

317
00:27:23,082 --> 00:27:25,016
certain death.

318
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:30,681
Which one is which?

319
00:27:30,757 --> 00:27:32,782
- We can't tell you.
- Why not?

320
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,527
- We don't know.
- But they do.

321
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:39,565
Oh. Then I'll ask them.

322
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:44,634
No, you can't ask us.
You can only ask one of us.

323
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,605
It's in the rules,
and I should warn you...

324
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:49,403
one ot us always tells the truth...

325
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:51,636
and one ot us always lies.

326
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,179
That's a rule too.
He always lies.

327
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:57,739
- I do not. I tell the truth.
- Oh, what a lie.

328
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,281
He's the liar.

329
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,023
All right. Answer yes or no.

330
00:28:05,358 --> 00:28:09,055
Would he tell me that this door
leads to the castle?

331
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:16,960
Yes.

332
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:20,967
Then the other door leads
to the castle...

333
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,974
and this door leads
to certain death.

334
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,738
- Ooh!
- How do you know?

335
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:28,679
- He could be telling the truth.
- But then you wouldn't be.

336
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,444
So it you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer is no.

337
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:34,350
- But I could be telling the truth.
- But then he would be lying.

338
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,878
So it you told me that he said yes,
I know the answer would still be no.

339
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:40,050
Wait a minute. Is that right?

340
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:42,754
I don't know.
I've never understood it.

341
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,191
No, it's right.
I tigured it out.

342
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,428
I could never do it before.

343
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:53,461
I think I'm getting smarter.
This is a piece of cake.

344
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,142
Help!

345
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:03,210
Stop it! Help!

346
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,019
What do you mean, "help"?
We are helping.

347
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:09,077
We're helping hands.

348
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:10,782
You're hurting.

349
00:29:10,857 --> 00:29:13,621
Would you like us to let go?

350
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,295
Well, then come on,
which way?

351
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:20,764
Which way?

352
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,597
Up or down?

353
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,195
- Oh.
- Come on, come on.

354
00:29:26,272 --> 00:29:28,206
We haven't got all day.

355
00:29:28,274 --> 00:29:31,072
Well, it's a big decision for her.

356
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,113
Which way do you want to go, hmm?

357
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:36,512
Yes, which way?

358
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:41,384
Well, since I'm pointed that way,
I guess I'll go down.

359
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:44,514
She chose down.

360
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,785
She chose down?

361
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:49,726
- Was that wrong?
- Too late now.

362
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:05,775
She's in the oubliette.

363
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,905
Shut up! She should not have gotten
as tar as the oubliette.

364
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:12,382
- She should have given up by now.
- She'll never give up.

365
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:15,683
Won't she? The dwarf's about
to lead her back to the beginning.

366
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:20,249
She'll soon give up when she realizes
she has to start all over again.

367
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,294
Well, laugh.

368
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,472
Who's there?

369
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,973
Me.

370
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:39,971
- Oh, it's you.
- Oh, yes, well...

371
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,106
I knew you were gonna get into trouble
as soon as I met you...

372
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:45,650
so I've come to give you a hand.

373
00:30:46,986 --> 00:30:49,147
Oh, you're looking around now,
aren't you?

374
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,055
I suppose you noticed
there ain't no doors.

375
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,059
Only the hole.

376
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:58,592
This is an oubliette.
The labyrinth's full ot them.

377
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:01,758
- Really? How do you know that?
- Oh, don't sound so smart.

378
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:05,099
- You don't know what an oubliette is.
- Do you?

379
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:08,197
Yes, it's a place you put people...

380
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:10,401
to forget about 'em.

381
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:14,105
Now, what you've gotta do
is get out of here.

382
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,115
And it so happens
that I know a short cut...

383
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:19,276
out ot the whole labyrinth
from here.

384
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:21,547
No, I'm not giving up now.

385
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:23,555
I've come too tar.

386
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,261
- No, I'm doing okay.
- Ot course you are.

387
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,527
But it gets a lot worse
trom here on in.

388
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:38,334
Why are you so concerned about me?

389
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:41,305
Well, I am, that's all.

390
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:45,811
Nice, young girl.
Terrible, black oubliette.

391
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,245
You like jewelry, don't you?

392
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:50,942
Why?

393
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:54,885
If you help me solve the labyrinth,
I'll give you this.

394
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:59,682
You like it, don't you?

395
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,853
- So-so.
- Oh. Okay.

396
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:07,495
Tell you what--
you give me the bracelet...

397
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,501
and I'll show you the way
out ot the labyrinth.

398
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:12,231
- You were gonna do that anyway.
- Yes.

399
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:16,674
That's what would make it a
particularly nice gesture on your part.

400
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:18,505
I'll tell you what--

401
00:32:18,578 --> 00:32:21,376
it you won't take me to the center,
take me as f ar as you can.

402
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:24,814
- Then I'll do it on my own.
- What is that anyway?

403
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,110
Plastic.

404
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:32,448
I don't promise nothing, but...

405
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:36,484
I'll take you as tar as I can,
then you're on your own, right?

406
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:38,723
- Right.
- Right.

407
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:42,000
Wow. Plastic!

408
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:48,406
Here we go.

409
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,674
Damn.

410
00:32:55,748 --> 00:32:57,181
Broom closet.

411
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:02,353
Well, can't be right
all the time.

412
00:33:05,424 --> 00:33:08,450
This is it. Come on then.

413
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:19,066
- This way.
- Don't go on.

414
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:22,437
Go back while you still can.

415
00:33:22,508 --> 00:33:25,671
This is not the way.

416
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:29,272
Take heed and go no further.

417
00:33:29,348 --> 00:33:33,648
Beware. Beware.

418
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:36,187
Soon it will be too late.

419
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,553
Yeah! Don't pay
any attention to them.

420
00:33:38,624 --> 00:33:42,185
They're just talse alarms.
You get a lot ot them in the labyrinth.

421
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:44,252
Especially when you're
on the right track.

422
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,265
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, shut up.

423
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,530
- Sorry. Just doing my job.
- You don't have to do it to us.

424
00:33:50,603 --> 00:33:53,629
- Beware tor--
- Just torget it.

425
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:57,369
Oh, please, I haven't said it
tor such a long time.

426
00:33:57,443 --> 00:34:00,935
Oh, all right, but don't
expect a big reaction.

427
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:03,743
No, no, no, ot course not.

428
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:07,946
For the path you will take
will lead to certain destruction.

429
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:10,955
- Thank you very much.
- Uh-oh.

430
00:34:11,023 --> 00:34:12,149
Oh, no.

431
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:20,457
What have we here?

432
00:34:20,533 --> 00:34:22,865
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

433
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,665
Nothing? Nothing?

434
00:34:25,738 --> 00:34:27,672
Nothing, tra-la-la.

435
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,732
Your Majesty,
what a nice surprise.

436
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,971
- Hello, Hedgewart.
- Hogwart.

437
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:34,478
Hoggle!

438
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:37,414
Hoggle, can it be
that you're helping this girl?

439
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:40,350
Helping? In what sense?

440
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:42,887
In the sense that you're
leading her towards the castle.

441
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,220
No, I was taking her back
to the beginning, Your Majesty.

442
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,725
What?

443
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:51,285
I told her I was going to
help her solve the labyrinth.

444
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:54,561
A little trickery on my part.
But actually--

445
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,694
What is that plastic thing
'round your wrist?

446
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,568
Oh, this!

447
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,369
My goodness,
where did this come trom?

448
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:07,969
- Higgle--
- Hoggle.

449
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:10,777
It I thought tor one second
that you were betraying me...

450
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,809
I'd be forced to suspend you headfirst
in the Bog ot Eternal Stench.

451
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:18,983
No, Your Majesty!
Not the Eternal Stench!

452
00:35:19,058 --> 00:35:20,992
Oh, yes, Hoggle!

453
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,585
And you, Sarah.

454
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,654
How are you enjoying
my labyrinth?

455
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:29,968
It's a piece ot cake.

456
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:31,697
Oh!

457
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:35,104
Really? Then how about
upping the stakes?

458
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,506
Hmm?

459
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:39,134
That's not tair!

460
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:41,304
You say that so often.

461
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,248
I wonder what your basis
tor comparison is.

462
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,785
So the labyrinth's
a piece of cake, is it?

463
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:51,345
Well, let's see how you deal
with this little slice.

464
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:01,130
Oh, no, the cleaners!

465
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,134
- What?
- Run!

466
00:36:09,508 --> 00:36:11,305
You okay?

467
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,312
Come on!

468
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,149
Faster!

469
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:27,752
The cleaners!
The Bog of Stench!

470
00:36:27,827 --> 00:36:30,455
You sure got his attention.

471
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,579
Ah, this is what we need.

472
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:58,919
A ladder. Follow me.

473
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:02,654
How can I trust you now that I know you
were taking me back to the beginning?

474
00:37:02,728 --> 00:37:04,286
I wasn't.

475
00:37:04,363 --> 00:37:08,800
I told him I was taking you back to the
beginning to throw him otf the scent.

476
00:37:08,868 --> 00:37:11,666
Hoggle, how can I believe
anything you say?

477
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:14,535
Well, let me put it this way.

478
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:16,734
What choice have you got?

479
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,544
You're right.

480
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:26,347
You see, you've gotta
understand my position.

481
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:29,910
I'm a coward,
and Jareth scares me.

482
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:34,085
- What kind ot position is that?
- No position. That's my point.

483
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,152
You wouldn't be so brave
if you'd ever smelled...

484
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:39,322
the Bog ot Eternal Stench.

485
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:41,457
It's-- It's--

486
00:37:44,603 --> 00:37:46,730
Is that all it does,
is smell?

487
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,138
Believe me, that's enough.

488
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,938
But the worst thing is,
it you so much...

489
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:54,104
as put a foot
in the Bog ot Stench...

490
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,411
you'll smell bad
for the rest ot your lite.

491
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,111
It'II never wash otf.

492
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,986
Here we are then.
You're on your own trom now on.

493
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:12,655
- What?
- That's it. I quit.

494
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:14,665
Wait a minute.

495
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,663
I didn't promise nothin'. I said
I'd take you as tar as I could go.

496
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,504
You little cheat.
You nasty little cheat.

497
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:27,512
Don't try to embarrass me.
I've got no pride.

498
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,639
Oh, yeah?

499
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:31,410
But them's my jewels!

500
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:34,941
You give 'em back.
Give them back. Give those back.

501
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:38,217
Give those back to me!

502
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,784
Now, there's the castle.
Which way should we try?

503
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,923
Them's my rightful property.
It's not tair!

504
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:49,467
No, it isn't.

505
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,935
But that's the way it is.

506
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:04,014
Excuse me, please,
but can you help me?

507
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:06,278
Oh, a young girl!

508
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:11,387
And who is this?

509
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:15,259
- My friend.
- Oh, yes.

510
00:39:15,327 --> 00:39:17,818
And what can I do tor you?

511
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,990
Please, can you tell--
That is--

512
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:22,590
I have to get to the castle
at the center ot the labyrinth.

513
00:39:22,668 --> 00:39:24,602
Do you know the way?

514
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:28,898
Well, yes, now.

515
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:31,636
You want to get to the castle.

516
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,008
How's that for brain power, huh?

517
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,376
Be quiet!

518
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:37,210
Ah, nuts.

519
00:39:37,283 --> 00:39:40,343
So, young woman...

520
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:44,788
the way forward
is sometimes the way back.

521
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:49,590
Will you listen to this crap!

522
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:52,825
- Will you please be quiet!
- Sorry. All right.

523
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:54,024
- Okay.
- Okay!

524
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:56,158
- All right.
- All right!

525
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:58,169
- What?
- Sorry.

526
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:01,638
Finished?

527
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:04,274
Yes.

528
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:08,107
Quite otten, young lady...

529
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,583
it seems like we're not getting
anywhere, when in tact--

530
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:16,018
- We are.
- We are.

531
00:40:16,088 --> 00:40:19,387
I'm certainly not getting
anywhere at the moment.

532
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,686
Join the club.

533
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,658
I think that's your lot.

534
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:30,964
Please leave a contribution
in the little box.

535
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:35,030
Don't you dare! Them's mine.

536
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,637
Well, I guess I can spare this.

537
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,889
Oh, you didn't
have to give him that.

538
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:52,890
He didn't tell you nothin'.

539
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:56,155
Well, then.
There go a couple of suckers.

540
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:01,590
Ah, it's so stimulating
being your hat.

541
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:05,897
Why-- Why did you say that...

542
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:08,098
about my being your friend?

543
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:09,663
Because you are.

544
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:12,836
You may not be much ot a triend,
but you're the only one I've got here.

545
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,610
Do you hear something?

546
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,150
- No, it's all right.
- Friend.

547
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:21,848
I like that.

548
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,722
I ain't never been
no one's triend betore.

549
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,059
- Good-bye!
- Wait a minute.

550
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:32,120
- Keep the stuft.
- Are you my triend or not?

551
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:34,597
No, I'm not.
Hoggle ain't no one's triend.

552
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:37,635
He looks after himselt,
like everyone.

553
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,467
Hoggle is Hoggle's triend.

554
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,064
Hoggle, you coward!

555
00:41:45,944 --> 00:41:47,878
Well, I'm not atraid.

556
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:51,313
Things aren't always
what they seem in this place.

557
00:41:57,623 --> 00:42:00,786
Try on this for size,
you big yeti!

558
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:03,487
We've got you now,
tuzz ball!

559
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:06,194
All together now.

560
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:16,272
It only I had something to throw.

561
00:42:24,516 --> 00:42:26,484
Sock it to him!
Sock it to him!

562
00:42:30,255 --> 00:42:34,919
What happened? Who turned out
the light? I can't see!

563
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:39,722
- Why'd you bite me?
- Who bite who?

564
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:42,130
Who bite me? Who bite me?

565
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:46,233
- I can't see!
- What is going on?

566
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:53,076
Retreat!

567
00:42:55,013 --> 00:42:56,173
Who bit me?

568
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:58,682
Oh, my aching sushi!

569
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,164
Now, stop that.

570
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,027
Is that any way to treat someone
who's trying to help you?

571
00:43:19,204 --> 00:43:22,071
Don't you want me
to help you down?

572
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:27,946
Ludo down.

573
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:29,446
Ludo?

574
00:43:30,616 --> 00:43:31,708
Is that your name?

575
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:38,181
You seem like such a nice beast.

576
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,460
Well, I certainly hope you
are what you seem to be.

577
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:47,296
Just hang on.
I'll get you down.

578
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:50,557
Just a second.

579
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,464
I'm sorry!

580
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:58,105
Ludo, are you hurt?

581
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:07,010
Friend?

582
00:44:07,085 --> 00:44:09,610
That's right, Ludo.

583
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,121
I'm Sarah.

584
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,957
Sarah.

585
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:18,255
Here, let me help you.

586
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,264
Are you okay?

587
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:29,307
Sarah triend.

588
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:31,865
Now, wait. Just a second.

589
00:44:31,944 --> 00:44:35,710
- I want to ask you something, Ludo.
- What?

590
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:39,376
I have to get to the castle at the
labyrinth's center. Do you know the way?

591
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:49,556
- No.
- You don't know either, huh?

592
00:44:49,628 --> 00:44:52,188
I wonder if anyone knows how
to get through this labyrinth.

593
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:57,393
Get through the labyrinth.
Get through the labyrinth.

594
00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:01,337
One thing tor sure-- she'll never
get through the labyrinth.

595
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,109
Hey.

596
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,676
Where did they come trom?

597
00:45:14,553 --> 00:45:16,282
What do you think?

598
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:19,017
Which shall we choose
out ot these two ugly characters?

599
00:45:23,562 --> 00:45:27,054
It's very rude to stare!

600
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:29,965
I'm sorry. I was just wondering
which door to choose.

601
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:32,230
- What?
- It's no good asking him.

602
00:45:32,304 --> 00:45:34,534
- He's as deat as a post.
- Don't talk with your mouth tull.

603
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,131
- I'm not talking with my mouth full!
- Wait a second.

604
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:39,336
- I can't understand you.
- What were you saying?

605
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,417
- It is so good to get that thing out.
- What were you saying?

606
00:45:48,487 --> 00:45:51,581
I said, it's no good talking to him.
He's as deat as a post.

607
00:45:51,657 --> 00:45:55,491
Mumble, mumble. You're a wondertul
conversational companion.

608
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,858
You can talk!
All you do is moan!

609
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:00,124
No good. Can't hear you.

610
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,901
- Where do these doors lead?
- What?

611
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,769
Search me.
We're just the knockers.

612
00:46:13,011 --> 00:46:14,979
- How do I get through?
- Huh?

613
00:46:15,047 --> 00:46:18,414
Knock, and the door will open.

614
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,385
I don't want that thing
back in my mouth.

615
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:31,895
- Come on. I want to knock.
- Mm-mmm.

616
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:34,693
Doesn't want his ring
back in his mouth, eh?

617
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:37,166
Can't say I blame him.

618
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:59,683
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I'm used to it.

619
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:09,659
Come on.

620
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,487
You're welcome.

621
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:38,824
He's a lively little chap.
I think I'll call him Jareth.

622
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,661
He's got my eyes.

623
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,682
Ludo scared.

624
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,480
Aw, give me your hand.

625
00:48:01,553 --> 00:48:03,214
Come on.

626
00:48:03,288 --> 00:48:05,950
Imagine a big thing like you
being scared.

627
00:48:06,024 --> 00:48:07,457
Yeah.

628
00:48:09,027 --> 00:48:11,894
See, Ludo? There's nothing
to be atraid of.

629
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,013
Ludo, where are you?

630
00:48:39,057 --> 00:48:41,184
Hoggle, help!

631
00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:45,491
- I'm comin', Sarah.
- Well, it it isn't you.

632
00:48:45,564 --> 00:48:48,192
And where are you going?

633
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:52,302
Well, the little lady
gave me the slip...

634
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,066
but I just hears her now...

635
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,371
so I was about to lead her
back to the beginning...

636
00:48:58,443 --> 00:49:00,536
like you told me.

637
00:49:00,612 --> 00:49:02,842
- I see.
- Ludo!

638
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:05,747
For one moment I thought
you were running to help her.

639
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:09,480
But no, not after my warnings.

640
00:49:09,554 --> 00:49:12,819
- That would be stupid.
- Oh, you bet it would!

641
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:16,520
Me help her
atter your warnings?

642
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:22,932
- Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead.
- Hoggle.

643
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:27,404
I've just noticed
your lovely jewels are missing.

644
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,872
Oh, yes, so they are.

645
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:33,934
My lovely jewels. Let me think.

646
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:37,106
I better tind 'em, but tirst
I'm ott to take the little lady...

647
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,174
back to the beginning ot the labyrinth,
just like we planned.

648
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:41,947
Wait.

649
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,045
I've got a much better plan.

650
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:47,784
Give her this.

651
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:52,252
Wha-- What is it?

652
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,888
It's a present.

653
00:49:53,965 --> 00:49:56,263
It ain't gonna hurt
the little lady, is it?

654
00:49:56,334 --> 00:49:58,029
Why the concern?

655
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,974
- I won't do nothin' to harm her.
- Oh, come, come, Hogbrain.

656
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,532
I'm surprised at you
losing your head over a girl.

657
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,510
I ain't lost my head.

658
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:09,911
You don't think a young girl
could ever like...

659
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:13,678
a repulsive little scab
like you, do you?

660
00:50:13,752 --> 00:50:15,777
She said we was--

661
00:50:15,854 --> 00:50:18,084
Bosom companions?

662
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:19,783
Friends?

663
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:23,217
- Don't matter.
- You'll give her that...

664
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:26,423
or I'II tip you straight
into the Bog of Eternal Stench...

665
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:28,432
betore you can blink.

666
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,058
Yes. Right.

667
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,233
And Hoggle...

668
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:37,503
if she ever kisses you,
I'll turn you into a prince.

669
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,567
You-- You will?

670
00:50:39,644 --> 00:50:42,010
Prince of the Land ot Stench.

671
00:50:48,453 --> 00:50:49,818
Ludo?

672
00:50:57,195 --> 00:50:59,129
What's going on?

673
00:51:03,368 --> 00:51:04,767
- What do you want?
- What, us?

674
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,199
We're just atter
having a good time.

675
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,400
That's right!

676
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,574
- Don't got no problems
- No problems

677
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:20,584
- Ain't got no suitcase
- No suitcase

678
00:51:20,652 --> 00:51:23,849
- Ain'f got no clothes to worry about
- No clothes to worry about

679
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:26,254
Ain't got no real estate or jewelry
or gold mines to hang me up

680
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,689
- I just throw in my hand
- Throw in his hand

681
00:51:29,761 --> 00:51:32,753
With the chilliest bunch
in the land

682
00:51:32,831 --> 00:51:34,890
- In the land
- They don't look like much

683
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,524
They're so chilly chilly

684
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:39,695
They positively glow glow
Chilly down

685
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:42,137
With the wild gang

686
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:45,438
Think small with the wild gang

687
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,944
Bang heads with the wild gang

688
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:49,742
Like the man said,
don't lose your head.

689
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:53,011
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down

690
00:51:53,084 --> 00:51:55,951
- With the wild gang
- Hey, I'm a wild child

691
00:51:56,021 --> 00:51:57,818
Let's fly with the wild gang

692
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,516
Walk tall.

693
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:03,322
- Good time, bad food
- Yeah.

694
00:52:03,395 --> 00:52:05,920
When your thing gets wild
Chilly down, chilly down

695
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:09,693
Roll 'em.

696
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:11,827
Snake eyes!

697
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:19,442
Hey, lady!

- So when things get too tough

00:52:36,895 --> 00:52:39,659
- Your chin is dragging on the ground
- Dragging on the ground

701
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:43,292
- And even down looks up

702
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,801
Bad luck

703

Just strut your nasty stuff
Wiggle in the middle, yeah

706
00:52:56,114 --> 00:52:58,582
Get the town talking, bad gang

707
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,517
- Chilly down with the wild gang

00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:03,986

00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:07,252
- Bang heads!
- Bang heads with the wild gang

710
00:53:07,325 --> 00:53:08,883
Hey, listen up.

714
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,829

715
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:21,337
Come on!

Hey, hey!
Her head don't come ott.

00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,308
Ot course it doesn't!

718
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,678
- She's right. It's stuck on.
- Hey, lady.

719

00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,882
Hey, man, I know what we can do.

Yeah, let's take her apart.

00:53:40,358 --> 00:53:42,121
Lady, that's his head.

723
00:53:42,193 --> 00:53:44,388
- That's my head!

724
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:47,090
What are you doing?

Hey! Wait!

726
00:53:53,404 --> 00:53:54,894
Hey, lady...

727
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:57,965
it's against the rules
to throw other people's heads.

728
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:00,442
You're only allowed
to throw your own head.

729
00:54:00,512 --> 00:54:02,207
Yeah, that's right.

730
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,612
Where's the reteree?

We'll just take your head ott.

- Play the game.
- Yeah, we're going to throw your head.

734
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:16,884
You can't quit.
The game's not over.

735
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,129
- Hey, lady!
- Leave me alone!

736
00:54:20,198 --> 00:54:24,396
- We get a free throw.
- Don't you want to take your head oft?

737
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,438
- Ot course she does.

00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:43,884

743
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:48,322
- Go away.
- Hoggle, you've come to help me.

744
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,521
Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me!

745
00:54:53,598 --> 00:54:57,034
No, no, no!

746
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:05,699
Hoggle, hold on.

747

Oh, my God.

Oh, what is it?

00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,525
The Bog ot Eternal Stench!

750
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:27,297
I never smelled anything like it.
It's like--

751
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:36,596
It doesn't matter what it's like.
It's a Bog ot Eternal Stench.

752
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:38,107

00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:42,510
Hold on.

754
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,750
What did you have to go
and do a thing like that tor?

755
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,912
Do what?

756
00:55:52,757 --> 00:55:55,817
- You mean rescue you?
- What? No.

757
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,021
You kissed me.

758
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:06,501
Oh, my gosh.

759
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,506
Don't pretend to be so hard.

760
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:13,408
I know you came back to help me,
and I know that you're my triend.

761
00:56:13,478 --> 00:56:15,309
Did not. Am not.

767
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:36,726

You're right.

Oh, my God.

776
00:57:05,263 --> 00:57:06,730
There's a bridge.

777
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,629
Come on.

778
00:57:13,604 --> 00:57:14,696
Watch it.

779
00:57:14,772 --> 00:57:18,469
You step in this stutt
and you'll stink torever.

780
00:57:20,712 --> 00:57:21,804
Stop!

781
00:57:23,047 --> 00:57:26,016
- Stop, I say.
- Please, we have to get across.

782
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:28,314
Without my permission,
no one may cross.

783
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:31,446
Please, I only have
a little time left!

784
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:33,717
We've gotta get out of this stench.

785
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:35,952
Smell bad.

786
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:38,825
- Stench? Ot what speaketh thou?
- This smell.

787
00:57:40,598 --> 00:57:43,294
- I smell nothing.
- Oh, you're joking.

788
00:57:43,368 --> 00:57:46,132
But I live
by my sense ot smell.

789
00:57:48,706 --> 00:57:52,802
The air is sweet and fragrant,
and none may pass without my permission!

790
00:57:52,877 --> 00:57:55,846
Smell bad.

00:57:55,913 --> 00:57:58,313
Oh, get out of my way!

792
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:01,318
I warn thee,

Listen, I don't want to

Let go of my staft, sir!

All right then.
I can conquer this mountain.

00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,858
Thou must do better than that.

799
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:54,199
Give up? Huh?

800
00:59:08,553 --> 00:59:09,747
Enough!

801
00:59:11,622 --> 00:59:14,455
Before this day, never have I
met my match in battle.

802
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:19,121
Yet this noble knight
has tought me to a standstill.

803
00:59:19,197 --> 00:59:22,758
- Are you all right, Ludo?
- Smell!

804
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:26,964
Sir Ludo, it that's thy name,
now l, Sir Didymus, yield to thee.

805
00:59:27,038 --> 00:59:29,973
Come, let us be brothers
hencetorth...

806
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,669
and fight tor the right as one!

807
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,080
- Thank you very much.
- Ludo get brother.

808
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:39,241
Steady.

809
00:59:40,485 --> 00:59:43,010
- Well met, Sir Ludo.
- Good. Come on.

810
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:46,579
Wait a minute!
You torget my sacred vow, my lady.

811
00:59:46,657 --> 00:59:50,457
- I cannot let you pass.
- But you said Ludo is your brother.

812
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:53,964
I have taken an oath,
and I must detend it to the death.

813
00:59:54,031 --> 00:59:56,761
- The smell!
- Okay.

814
00:59:56,834 --> 01:00:00,326
Let's handle this thing logically.
What exactly have you sworn?

815
01:00:00,404 --> 01:00:04,500
I have sworn with my liteblood
no one shall pass this way...

816
01:00:04,575 --> 01:00:06,839
without my permission.

817
01:00:09,013 --> 01:00:12,346
Well, may we have your permission?

818
01:00:13,518 --> 01:00:14,951
Well, l--

819
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:25,954
- Yes.
- Thank you, noble sir.

820
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,395
My lady.

821
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:34,004
- Uh-oh.
- Have no fear, sweet lady.

822
01:00:34,071 --> 01:00:36,403
This bridge has lasted
for a thousand years.

823
01:00:46,984 --> 01:00:49,043
- It seemed solid enough.
- Hoggle!

824
01:00:53,324 --> 01:00:55,986
Fear not, tair maiden.
I will save thee.

825
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,084
Somehow.

826
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:03,291
Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl
when yon maiden needs our help?

827
01:01:33,264 --> 01:01:35,994
- That's incredible, Ludo.
- My brother!

828
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:38,365
Canst thou summon up
the very rocks?

829
01:01:38,436 --> 01:01:42,532
Sure. Rocks friends.

830
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:50,273
- Here.
- Thanks, Hoggle.

831
01:01:54,285 --> 01:01:56,219
Be caretul, Ludo.

832
01:02:03,127 --> 01:02:05,459
Wait tor me.

833
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:09,795
Ambrosious, it's all right.
You can come out now.

834
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:13,428
Come on. That-a boy.

835
01:02:13,504 --> 01:02:16,337
My loyal steed. Steady.

836
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:22,536
Forward. Steady, boy.

837
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:26,105
Come on, Ambrosious.
Just close your eyes and go.

838
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,821
Let's get out of here.

839
01:02:35,593 --> 01:02:37,527
Excuse us. Thank you.

840
01:02:44,101 --> 01:02:46,934
I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

841
01:02:47,004 --> 01:02:50,496
Oh, please,
I can't give it to her.

842
01:02:54,045 --> 01:02:57,776
Come on then. We should reach
the castle well betore day.

843
01:03:04,755 --> 01:03:08,122
Look, Sarah, is this
what you're trying to find?

844
01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:14,358
So much trouble over such
a little thing, but not tor long.

845
01:03:14,432 --> 01:03:18,892
She'll soon forget all about you,
my tine tellow.

846
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:22,097
Just as soon as Hoggle
gives her my present...

847
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,370
then she'll torget everything.

848
01:03:27,078 --> 01:03:29,945
Is that my stomach or yours,
Ambrosious?

849
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:32,715
Hungry.

850
01:03:33,884 --> 01:03:38,287
Yeah. Well, we can't stop now.

851
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:41,291
Maybe we can tind
some berries or something.

852
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,087
Yeah?

853
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,390
Here.

854
01:03:50,234 --> 01:03:52,327
Thank you!

855
01:03:52,403 --> 01:03:54,530
You're a litesaver.

856
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,508
This tastes strange.

857
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:15,220
What have you done?

858
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:18,625
Oh, damn you, Jareth.

859
01:04:18,696 --> 01:04:21,096
And damn me too.

860
01:04:32,543 --> 01:04:34,477
Everything's dancing.

861
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:42,843
Yea, verily.
Whoa, Ambrosious, whoa!

862
01:05:42,913 --> 01:05:47,213
The castle doth lie yonder,
my lady.

863
01:05:47,284 --> 01:05:49,218
My lady?

864
01:06:39,336 --> 01:06:42,533
There's such a sad love

865
01:06:42,606 --> 01:06:47,634
Deep in your eyes
A kind of pale jewel

866
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:51,442
Open and closed
within your eyes

867
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:53,983
I'll place the sky

868
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:57,248
Within your eyes

869
01:06:58,722 --> 01:07:02,158
There's such a fooled heart

870
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,784
Beating so fast

871
01:07:03,861 --> 01:07:06,193
In search of new dreams

872
01:07:06,263 --> 01:07:08,663
A love that will last

873
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:10,927
Within your heart

874
01:07:11,001 --> 01:07:13,492
I'll place the moon

875
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:17,132
Within your heart

876
01:07:18,509 --> 01:07:20,909
As the pain sweeps through

877
01:07:20,978 --> 01:07:23,378
Makes no sense for you

878
01:07:23,447 --> 01:07:25,813
Every thrill has gone

879
01:07:25,883 --> 01:07:29,842
Wasn't too much fun at all

880
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:35,848
But I'll be there for you

881
01:07:36,827 --> 01:07:40,456
As the world falls down

882
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:41,930
Falling

883
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,765
- As the world falls down
- It's falling

884
01:07:52,009 --> 01:07:53,601
Falling in love

885
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:59,082
I'll paint you mornings of gold

886
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:02,243
I'll spin you Valentine evenings

887
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:07,086
Though we're strangers till now
We're choosing the path

888
01:08:07,157 --> 01:08:09,250
Between the stars

889
01:08:09,326 --> 01:08:11,817
I'll lay my love

890
01:08:11,895 --> 01:08:15,160
Between the stars

891
01:08:16,934 --> 01:08:19,334
As the pain sweeps through

892
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:21,963
Makes no sense for you

893
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:24,132
Every thrill has gone

894
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:28,076
Wasn't too much fun at all

895
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:33,942
But I'll be there for you

896
01:08:35,185 --> 01:08:38,677
As the world falls down

897
01:08:38,756 --> 01:08:40,189
Falling

898
01:08:44,862 --> 01:08:47,854
- As the world falls down
- It's falling

899
01:08:50,934 --> 01:08:52,367
It's falling

900
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:11,452
Falling in love

901
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:48,782
Oh, she'll never forgive me.

902
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:50,952
What have I done?

903
01:09:51,028 --> 01:09:54,020
I've lost my only triend.

904
01:09:54,098 --> 01:09:56,191
That's what I've done.

905
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,644
What was I doing?

906
01:10:20,724 --> 01:10:22,658
Get oft my back!

907
01:10:25,162 --> 01:10:27,756
Why don't you look
where you're going...

908
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:29,799
young woman, hmm?

909
01:10:31,135 --> 01:10:34,298
- I was looking.
- Huh? Huh?

910
01:10:34,371 --> 01:10:37,397
Where were you going, hmm?

911
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:39,237
I don't remember.

912
01:10:39,309 --> 01:10:42,574
You can't look where you're going
it you don't know where you're going.

913
01:10:42,646 --> 01:10:44,307
I was searching tor something.

914
01:10:45,182 --> 01:10:46,774
Look here.

915
01:10:51,688 --> 01:10:53,121
Lancelot?

916
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:56,251
Thank you.

917
01:10:56,326 --> 01:11:00,820
That's what you were looking tor,
wasn't it, my dear?

918
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:04,026
Yes. I torgot.

919
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:07,127
Now, why don't you...

920
01:11:07,204 --> 01:11:09,434
come in here...

921
01:11:09,506 --> 01:11:12,441
and see if there's
anything else...

922
01:11:12,509 --> 01:11:14,841
you'd like, hmm?

923
01:11:45,309 --> 01:11:47,368
It was just a dream.

924
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,640
I dreamed it all, Lancelot.

925
01:11:54,918 --> 01:11:56,977
But it was so real.

926
01:12:00,157 --> 01:12:02,785
Let's go see it Daddy's back,
okay?

927
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:10,499
Better to stay in here, dear.
Yes.

928
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:15,004
There's nothing you want
out there. No!

929
01:12:15,072 --> 01:12:18,007
Oh, what have we got here?

930
01:12:18,075 --> 01:12:19,508
Lancelot.

931
01:12:20,577 --> 01:12:23,068
Your little bunny rabbit.
You like your little bunny rabbit.

932
01:12:23,146 --> 01:12:25,546
Don't you? Yes, yes.
There you go.

933
01:12:25,616 --> 01:12:28,107
There's Betsy Bou.
You remember Betsy Bou, don't you?

934
01:12:28,185 --> 01:12:30,016
Yes, yes.

935
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:33,523
Now, then, what else have we got?
What's this? Let's have a look.

936
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:36,184
It's a pencil box.
Got lots of pencils in it too.

937
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:40,757
Here's your panda slippers.
You know how much you like them.

938
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:44,358
You never wanted them thrown away.
There they are. That's right.

939
01:12:44,434 --> 01:12:48,165
Okay, now then, what else?
Oh, it's little Horsey.

940
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,672
You love little Horsey,
don't you, dear?

941
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:54,837
And look at this!
You got a printing game, you have.

942
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:58,609
Oh, here's a treasure.
You'll want that, won't you, my dear?

943
01:12:58,682 --> 01:13:02,516
Yes, go on, put it on.
Make yourselt up.

944
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:06,044
Here's dear old Flopsy.
You'll want her. There you go.

945
01:13:06,857 --> 01:13:10,054
Oh, yes. Ah, oh, yes.

946
01:13:10,127 --> 01:13:13,927
Charlie Bear. Right.
There's Charlie Bear tor you.

947
01:13:13,997 --> 01:13:15,931
There was something
I was looking tor.

948
01:13:15,999 --> 01:13:18,467
Ah, don't talk nonsense.

949
01:13:18,535 --> 01:13:23,632
It's all here. Everything you've
ever cared about is all right here.

950
01:13:23,707 --> 01:13:26,107
There's your little toy candy shop.

951
01:13:26,176 --> 01:13:27,541
"Through dangers untold...

952
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,375
and hardships unnumbered...

953
01:13:31,415 --> 01:13:34,851
I tought my way here
to the castle...

954
01:13:34,918 --> 01:13:37,546
beyond the Goblin City...

955
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:40,954
to take back the child
that you have stolen."

956
01:13:42,326 --> 01:13:45,921
What's the matter, my dear?
Don't you like your toys?

957
01:13:46,997 --> 01:13:48,089
It's all junk.

958
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:51,963
Well, what about this?

959
01:13:52,035 --> 01:13:55,937
This is not junk, eh?

960
01:13:56,873 --> 01:13:59,307
Yes, it is!

961
01:14:00,344 --> 01:14:03,108
I have to save Toby!

962
01:14:07,451 --> 01:14:08,884
My lady!

963
01:14:11,221 --> 01:14:13,155
Are you all right?

964
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,558
Fair maiden. Thank goodness
thou art safe at last.

965
01:14:22,632 --> 01:14:24,862
- Where are we?
- Sarah back.

966
01:14:24,935 --> 01:14:27,369
My lady, we're almost there.

967
01:14:27,437 --> 01:14:29,905
Those are the gates
to the Goblin City.

968
01:14:29,973 --> 01:14:32,134
Ludo, Sir Didymus.

969
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:35,974
Let's go quickly.
We don't have much time.

970
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:38,378
- Yeah.
- Right, Ambrosious.

971
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:40,439
Forward.

972
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:41,950
You know.

973
01:14:45,188 --> 01:14:47,418
Open up. Open the door.

974
01:14:47,491 --> 01:14:49,652
Sir Didymus, we must go quietly.

975
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:53,729
Open up. Open up right now!

976
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:55,287
You'll wake the guard.

977
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:56,696
Quiet.

978
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:59,531
Well, let them all wake up!

979
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:03,597
I shall tight you all
to the death!

980
01:15:05,642 --> 01:15:09,043
Please, Sir Didymus,
tor my sake, hush.

981
01:15:09,112 --> 01:15:11,239
But of course.
For thee, anything.

982
01:15:11,314 --> 01:15:13,680
- But I'm not a coward?
- No.

983
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,911
- And my sense ot smell is keen?
- Oh, yes.

984
01:15:15,986 --> 01:15:19,615
Then I shall tight anyone
anywhere, anyplace, any time!

985
01:15:19,689 --> 01:15:21,520
We know!

986
01:15:21,591 --> 01:15:23,024
Now hush.

987
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:27,088
Quietly.

988
01:15:27,164 --> 01:15:29,598
Ambrosious, be quiet now.

989
01:15:31,034 --> 01:15:33,264
I don't see why we
have to be so quiet.

990
01:15:33,336 --> 01:15:35,531
It's only a Goblin City.

991
01:15:35,605 --> 01:15:37,539
I smell trouble.

992
01:15:43,346 --> 01:15:44,779
Come on, Ludo.

993
01:15:46,116 --> 01:15:47,515
Oh, no.

994
01:15:51,388 --> 01:15:53,322
What is that?

995
01:15:57,394 --> 01:15:59,521
Who goes?

996
01:16:05,135 --> 01:16:06,966
Who goes?

997
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:23,912
Watch out!

998
01:16:37,734 --> 01:16:39,861
Ambrosious, will you come here?

999
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,800
Come here right now!

1000
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:48,270
Will you please come into the open?
You're embarrassing me.

1001
01:17:03,093 --> 01:17:05,118
Look out!

1002
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,455
Get out ot there.

1003
01:17:10,734 --> 01:17:12,702
What are you doing?

1004
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:16,104
Bombs away!

1005
01:17:19,609 --> 01:17:21,634
That wasn't very nice.

1006
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:24,640
My turn now.

1007
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:28,611
How do you drive this thing?

1008
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:34,482
Drop the ax!

1009
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:36,856
I'm trying.

1010
01:17:36,927 --> 01:17:39,987
Come here at once.

1011
01:17:40,063 --> 01:17:42,327
What's happened?

1012
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:44,333
Where's reverse?

1013
01:17:51,308 --> 01:17:54,436
Get out ot there, Hoggle!

1014
01:17:54,511 --> 01:17:56,240
Abandon ship.

1015
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:07,083
Hoggle, are you all right?

1016
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,922
I'm not asking to be forgiven.
I ain't ashamed ot nothin' I did.

1017
01:18:11,995 --> 01:18:15,487
Jareth made me give you
that peach.

1018
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:19,194
I don't care what you think ot me.
I told you I was a coward.

1019
01:18:19,269 --> 01:18:21,260
I ain't interested
in being triends.

1020
01:18:22,706 --> 01:18:24,105
I forgive you.

1021
01:18:25,675 --> 01:18:27,905
You-- You do?

1022
01:18:29,179 --> 01:18:32,842
And I commend you.
Rarely have I seen such courage.

1023
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:36,215
You are a valiant man,
Sir Hoggle.

1024
01:18:36,286 --> 01:18:38,948
- I am?
- Yeah.

1025
01:18:39,022 --> 01:18:41,456
Hoggle and Ludo friends.

1026
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:45,227
- We are?
- Yeah.

1027
01:18:45,295 --> 01:18:46,819
Here are your things.

1028
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:49,459
Thanks for your help.

1029
01:18:49,532 --> 01:18:53,024
Well, what are we waiting tor?

1030
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,628
Let's get the rat
who calls himself Jareth.

1031
01:18:55,705 --> 01:18:57,229
Right. Come on.

1032
01:18:57,307 --> 01:19:00,242
Ambrosious, it's sate now.
Nothing to be afraid of.

1033
01:19:26,002 --> 01:19:28,232
Your Highness!

1034
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:33,333
- Your Highness, the girl--
- What?

1035
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:36,743
- Who ate the peach, torgot everything.
- What of her?

1036
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:39,976
She's here with the monster and Sir
Didymus and the dwarf who works tor you.

1037
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:43,019
- What?
- They're on their way to the castle!

1038
01:19:43,086 --> 01:19:47,079
Stop her! Call out the guards.
Take the baby and hide it.

1039
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,249
Guards!

1040
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:51,317
She must be stopped.
Do something!

1041
01:19:52,262 --> 01:19:55,425
Come on, move. Move!

1042
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:08,170
- I think we're gonna make it.
- Oh, piece ot cake.

1043
01:20:14,784 --> 01:20:17,810
Company, halt.

1044
01:20:24,427 --> 01:20:27,362
Lances ready!

1045
01:20:30,567 --> 01:20:32,558
Cannon, tire!

1046
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:41,374
Ambrosious, turn around.
Turn about.

1047
01:20:41,444 --> 01:20:44,174
- Quick, this way.
- All right. Charge!

1048
01:20:45,815 --> 01:20:47,806
No, not that way!

1049
01:20:49,586 --> 01:20:53,022
You're going the wrong way!

1050
01:20:53,089 --> 01:20:55,023
The battle's behind us!

1051
01:20:58,962 --> 01:21:02,796
Ambrosious, can we please
talk about this?

1052
01:21:02,866 --> 01:21:04,299
Sit!

1053
01:21:08,838 --> 01:21:11,363
Be caretul. Okay.

1054
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:12,874
Through here.

1055
01:21:15,678 --> 01:21:19,307
Ambrosious, stand still.

1056
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,184
Okay, come on, guys.

1057
01:21:23,686 --> 01:21:26,519
Ambrosious, it you don't
turn around this second...

1058
01:21:26,589 --> 01:21:29,387
I will never feed you again.

1059
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:33,094
That's better.

1060
01:21:34,864 --> 01:21:37,697
Don't worry, Ambrosious.
I think we've got them surrounded.

1061
01:21:40,737 --> 01:21:43,399
Didymus! Where's Didymus?

1062
01:21:43,473 --> 01:21:45,907
Fire!

1063
01:21:47,977 --> 01:21:49,911
I hit something, yes? No?

1064
01:21:51,314 --> 01:21:53,748
We've got to tind Didymus.

1065
01:21:55,318 --> 01:21:57,650
Down this way.

1066
01:22:15,004 --> 01:22:17,905
Charge!

1067
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:26,748
Tallyho!

1068
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:33,186
Ambrosious, you coward.

1069
01:22:43,233 --> 01:22:45,633
Quick, in here.

1070
01:22:45,702 --> 01:22:47,533
How's Ludo gonna get in?

1071
01:23:09,292 --> 01:23:11,385
You in there,
you're surrounded!

1072
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:13,991
Surrounded?

1073
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:19,130
Get out!
Ludo, hold the roof!

1074
01:23:30,513 --> 01:23:32,674
- Take that!
- Hungry?

1075
01:23:37,987 --> 01:23:40,854
Ambrosious, unlock this door.

1076
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:49,254
So, had enough, have you?

1077
01:23:49,332 --> 01:23:53,928
Then throw down your weapons,
and I'll see that you're well-treated.

1078
01:24:21,497 --> 01:24:23,465
Next time, surrender.

1079
01:24:33,142 --> 01:24:35,303
Good griet!

1080
01:24:40,483 --> 01:24:41,575
Steady, men.

1081
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,447
Steady, men. Hold your ground.

1082
01:24:51,227 --> 01:24:54,253
Okay, I take it back.
Run tor your lives!

1083
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:57,527
I've had enough!
I'm going to bed.

1084
01:24:59,736 --> 01:25:01,727
Get out ot my house!

1085
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,158
Whoa, Nellie! Duck!

1086
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:30,530
Missed!

1087
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,397
Okay, come on.

1088
01:25:34,904 --> 01:25:36,337
Fire!

1089
01:25:38,808 --> 01:25:40,901
Hey, I just tired you.

1090
01:25:40,977 --> 01:25:42,808
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

1091
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:47,115
This way.

1092
01:25:51,554 --> 01:25:52,646
Now we have you!

1093
01:25:54,857 --> 01:25:56,290
And now you don't.

1094
01:26:13,743 --> 01:26:15,870
Hey, no problem.

1095
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:22,010
- Sir Didymus!
- Coming!

1096
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,982
Hi-ho, Silver!

1097
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,569
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, big fella.
- This way.

1098
01:26:40,636 --> 01:26:42,069
Steady, boy.

1099
01:26:44,006 --> 01:26:47,305
Ah, yes. Up we go. Up, up.

1100
01:26:49,612 --> 01:26:51,546
Come on. Good boy.

1101
01:26:51,614 --> 01:26:53,548
Come on.

1102
01:26:53,616 --> 01:26:54,913
No.

1103
01:26:54,984 --> 01:26:56,849
Good boy. Come on.

1104
01:26:58,287 --> 01:27:01,450
-That's the only way he could have gone.
-Well, then, come on.

1105
01:27:01,524 --> 01:27:04,960
- I have to f ace him alone.
- But why?

1106
01:27:05,027 --> 01:27:07,154
Because that's the way it's done.

1107
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:09,790
Well, it that is the way
it is done...

1108
01:27:09,866 --> 01:27:12,130
then that is the way
you must do it.

1109
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:14,999
But should you need us--

1110
01:27:15,938 --> 01:27:18,236
Yes, should you need us--

1111
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:20,774
I'll call.

1112
01:27:21,844 --> 01:27:23,709
Thank you, all of you.

1113
01:27:48,838 --> 01:27:51,272
How you've turned my world

1114
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:53,638
You precious thing

1115
01:27:56,646 --> 01:28:00,047
You starve and near exhaust me

1116
01:28:01,918 --> 01:28:04,148
Everything I've done

1117
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:06,711
I've done for you

1118
01:28:09,759 --> 01:28:11,852
I move the stars for no one

1119
01:28:16,632 --> 01:28:18,566
You've run so long

1120
01:28:18,634 --> 01:28:20,363
You've run so far

1121
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:29,636
Your eyes can be so cruel

1122
01:28:32,315 --> 01:28:36,376
Just as I can be so cruel

1123
01:28:41,157 --> 01:28:44,422
Though I do believe in you

1124
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,659
Toby!

1125
01:28:48,631 --> 01:28:52,397
Yes, I do

1126
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,763
Live without your sunlight

1127
01:28:59,242 --> 01:29:01,676
Love without your heartbeat

1128
01:29:04,814 --> 01:29:08,773
l, I can't live

1129
01:29:08,851 --> 01:29:12,048
Within you

1130
01:29:53,162 --> 01:29:55,562
Toby!

1131
01:30:56,525 --> 01:30:58,459
Give me the child.

1132
01:30:58,527 --> 01:31:00,859
Sarah, beware.

1133
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:05,162
I have been generous up until now,
and I can be cruel.

1134
01:31:05,234 --> 01:31:06,667
Generous?

1135
01:31:08,871 --> 01:31:12,204
- What have you done that's generous?
- Everything!

1136
01:31:12,274 --> 01:31:15,209
Everything that you have wanted,
I have done.

1137
01:31:15,277 --> 01:31:19,213
You asked that the child be taken.
I took him.

1138
01:31:19,281 --> 01:31:22,580
You cowered before me.
I was frightening.

1139
01:31:22,651 --> 01:31:25,017
I have reordered time.

1140
01:31:25,087 --> 01:31:27,817
I have turned the world
upside-down...

1141
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:30,484
and I have done it all for you.

1142
01:31:32,094 --> 01:31:36,087
I am exhausted trom living up
to your expectations of me.

1143
01:31:36,165 --> 01:31:37,359
Isn't that generous?

1144
01:31:40,903 --> 01:31:44,168
Through dangers untold
and hardships unnumbered...

1145
01:31:45,674 --> 01:31:49,508
I have fought my way here to the castle
beyond the Goblin City.

1146
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:54,148
For my will
is as strong as yours...

1147
01:31:55,418 --> 01:31:58,444
- and my--
- Stop. Wait.

1148
01:31:58,521 --> 01:32:00,148
Look, Sarah.

1149
01:32:00,222 --> 01:32:03,919
Look what I'm otfering you.

1150
01:32:03,993 --> 01:32:05,460
Your dreams.

1151
01:32:07,696 --> 01:32:10,256
And my kingdom as great--

1152
01:32:10,332 --> 01:32:13,165
I ask for so little.

1153
01:32:13,235 --> 01:32:15,760
Just let me rule you...

1154
01:32:15,838 --> 01:32:19,274
and you can have everything
that you want.

1155
01:32:22,011 --> 01:32:25,503
Kingdom as great?

1156
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:26,912
Damn.

1157
01:32:26,982 --> 01:32:29,246
I can never remember that line.

1158
01:32:29,318 --> 01:32:33,118
Just fear me, love me,
do as I say...

1159
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:35,589
and I will be your slave.

1160
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:40,721
My kingdom as great--
My kingdom as great--

1161
01:32:47,403 --> 01:32:49,894
You have no power over me.

1162
01:32:51,707 --> 01:32:54,699
You have no power over me.

1163
01:33:38,521 --> 01:33:39,954
Toby.

1164
01:34:15,324 --> 01:34:18,122
Here you are.

1165
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:21,163
I'd like Lancelot
to belong to you now.

1166
01:34:44,587 --> 01:34:46,020
We're home.

1167
01:34:52,795 --> 01:34:54,854
Sarah, are you home?

1168
01:34:55,931 --> 01:34:58,195
Yeah. Yes, I'm home.

1169
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:03,304
Good-bye, Sarah.

1170
01:35:12,982 --> 01:35:14,506

1172

01:35:20,022 --> 01:35:22,923
tor any reason at all--

1174
01:35:22,992 --> 01:35:25,460
I need you, Hoggle.

01:35:25,527 --> 01:35:26,960
You do?

1176
01:35:28,297 --> 01:35:30,788
I don't know why, but...

1177
01:35:30,866 --> 01:35:33,460

in my lite...

All of you.

You do?

1181
01:35:40,743 --> 01:35:44,076
Well, why didn't you say so?

1182
01:35:55,457 --> 01:35:57,618
- Oh, Ludo!
- Sarah.

1183
01:35:57,693 --> 01:36:01,288
Ambrosious,
good boy, good boy.

1184
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,932
I say, does anyone here
want to play a game ot Scrabble?

1185
01:36:32,795 --> 01:36:34,729
- You remind me of the babe.
- What babe?

1186
01:36:34,797 --> 01:36:36,628
- The babe with the power.
- What power?

1187
01:36:36,699 --> 01:36:38,860
The power of voodoo. You do.

1188
01:36:38,934 --> 01:36:41,562
- Do what?
- Remind me of the babe.

1189
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:49,875
- Daddy, Daddy, get me out of here
- Heard about a place today

1190
01:36:49,945 --> 01:36:52,140
l, I'm underground

1191
01:36:52,214 --> 01:36:54,876
Nothing ever hurts again

1192
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:58,511
- Heard about a place today
- Daddy, get me out of here

1193
01:36:58,587 --> 01:37:00,919
Where nothing ever hurts again

1194
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:03,082
Wanna go underground

1195
01:37:03,158 --> 01:37:07,288
- Daddy, Daddy, get me out of here
- Wanna go underground

1196
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:11,697
- l, I'm underground
- Get me underground

1197
01:37:11,767 --> 01:37:16,067

Daddy, Daddy, get me out of here

No one can blame you

1202
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:39,025
For walking away

1203
01:37:40,929 --> 01:37:44,194
But too much rejection

1204
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:48,966
No love injection

1205
01:37:50,072 --> 01:37:52,199
Life can be easy

1206
01:37:54,042 --> 01:37:57,034
It's not always swell

1207
01:37:58,781 --> 01:38:02,774
Don't tell me truth hurts
little girl

1208
01:38:02,851 --> 01:38:05,547
'Cause it hurts like hell

1209
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:09,690
But down in the underground

1210
01:38:11,627 --> 01:38:14,061
You'll find someone true

1211
01:38:15,697 --> 01:38:18,359
Down in the underground

1212
01:38:20,302 --> 01:38:22,532
A land serene

1213
01:38:22,604 --> 01:38:25,630
A crystal moon

1214
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:32,003
It's only forever

1215
01:38:33,715 --> 01:38:35,910
Not long at all

1216
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:40,653
The lost and the lonely

1217
01:38:41,957 --> 01:38:44,585
That's underground

1218
