l just feel
like so many people
go through this life

01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:59,315
looking for what
l've found here,

And they themselves,
they never find it.

1555
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:06,030
Or worse, they find it,
but they let it slip away.

l am so afraid
of that happening.

l beg you for mercy.
