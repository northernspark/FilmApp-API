3
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:13,085
Lassie, come home!

4
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:28,838
All right, folks, it's moving day.

5
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:36,325
- I told you not to watch this crap.
- I like "Lassie".

6
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:38,318
Jennifer!

7
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:41,235
You'll thank me when you're older.

8
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:44,682
Jennifer! Breakfast, honey.
You better hurry.

9
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:48,406
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm fine!

10
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:23,644
Matt! 2.30! We're going!

11
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,241
Steve, did you load
that brown suitcase?

12
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,637
It's under four suitcases.

13
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:35,597
- I put Jennifer's books in it for the trip.
- Why would you do that?

14
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:37,961
I'm sorry.

15
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:41,362
Honey...

16
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,683
- Last minute jitters.
- Me, too.

17
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:54,245
- Does this move make sense?
- Yes.

18
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:59,278
We're going to be living in the house
where Anne grew up.

19
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,600
I can handle that...

20
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:07,241
...I think.

21
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,040
Jennifer, how many kids
are there in the world?

22
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,596
- I don't know.
- Billions, OK?

23
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:37,564
- A quarter of those are kids, right?
- Yeah.

24
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:39,843
Well, that means...

25
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:43,716
...250 million kids
at about three presents a kid.

26
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:46,920
That means 750 million presents,

27
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:51,603
in one night, with one guy
and eight reindeer.

28
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,076
- Dad!
- What's going on?

29
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:58,125
- Nothing... The guy is a hoax.
- Mom!

30
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:01,800
Her name is Laura.

31
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:38,524
We've got a long drive
ahead of us, girl.

32
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:02,524
Matt, what do you say
we stop and get something to eat?

33
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,677
Hey, Matt!

34
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:08,238
- Matt!
- Look out!

35
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:31,040
What a mess!

36
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,997
I got it, here we go.

37
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,605
All right, people, back in your cars.

38
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:09,959
All right, load up.
Looks like we're moving.

39
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:12,276
Hey, Matt, look! It's Lassie!

40
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:16,485
Jennifer, there's no such thing.
First Santa Claus, now...

41
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:20,442
- Holy cow!
- See, I told you. It is Lassie!

42
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:22,995
- Jennifer...
- It's Lassie, Dad.

43
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,079
- Jennifer, don't touch a strange dog.
- It's hurt.

44
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:29,603
- Jen, he'll be fine. Come on.
- It's a she!

45
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,326
- Come on!
- We can't just leave her here.

46
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:34,523
- Steve...
- Honey, please!

47
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:37,326
She's all alone.

48
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,360
Matt, hop in.

49
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:56,479
Lumber's half-price, so the cost is
low, and there's no hassle for permits.

50
00:08:56,647 --> 00:09:01,640
- Can I play the jukebox? I got money.
- No Paula Abdul or Janet Jackson.

51
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,201
- You're not going to eat that?
- I'm not hungry.

52
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,961
Then why did you order it?

53
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:14,400
- Look, it's Lassie, she's back!
- Jennifer, it's not Lassie.

54
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,399
- How do you know?
- Lassie doesn't exist.

55
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,160
Whatever doesn't exist
just followed us here.

56
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,522
- Can we keep her?
- Of course not.

57
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,166
Why?

58
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:28,524
It probably belongs to somebody,
and we're full enough as it is.

59
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:32,116
- There she is.
- How did you find us?

60
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:36,404
- Jen, be careful.
- See, she loves us.

61
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:38,682
She wants to be with us.

62
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:43,238
Sweetie, she doesn't really love us,
she just wants food.

63
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:46,205
- Kids are supposed to have dogs.
- Jennifer!

64
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:49,484
- It helps us grow up right.
- I think she's sweet.

65
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:52,480
- Honey, you too?
- It's weird enough as it is.

66
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:55,285
- Why not add a dog?
- Honey, come on!

67
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:58,404
- Why not?
- Please, Dad!

68
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,842
This is ridiculous.
Where would we put it?

69
00:10:03,966 --> 00:10:07,642
How about the back seat?
Come on, let's take her.

70
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,162
Please, Dad!

71
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,557
- All right, the back seat.
- Yes!

72
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,754
Hey, Matt!

73
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:38,124
Hey, cut it out! Cut it out!
Get away from me.

74
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Move over.

75
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,326
- This dog stinks.
- Look who's talking!

76
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:54,284
I don't have fur!

77
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,756
Come here, Lassie.

78
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:32,202
Well, this is it.

79
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,884
- Franklin Falls.
- 148?

80
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,765
It's the country, pal.
There's room out here.

81
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:45,442
148? There's more people than that
in a supermarket.

82
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,995
- Matt!
- There's more people on a subway.

83
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:52,365
- You've never been on a subway.
- I know what they hold.

84
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:56,280
You took us to nowhere.
That's where we've moved to.

85
00:11:56,447 --> 00:12:00,565
- Soon you'll like it here.
- I'll take the bus back to Baltimore.

86
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:03,639
- There's my grandkids!
- Grandpa!

87
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,400
- Hello, princess.
- I missed you, Grandpa.

88
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:10,957
I missed you, too, honey.
And how's my big fellow?

89
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:14,038
- Is that an earring you're wearing?
- Yeah.

90
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:18,201
- Hi, Len.
- Hello, Steve.

91
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:21,245
Len, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Laura.

92
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,922
- I'm glad to meet you, ma'am.
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

93
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:29,956
I can't tell you how good it is to have
these two youngsters back with me.

94
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:34,481
- What do we have here?
- That's our new dog.

95
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:38,003
Just a stray we picked up
on the side of the road.

96
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:41,125
Just a stray?
This is a beautiful dog.

97
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:45,599
- It's a fine pedigree, I bet you.
- See!

98
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:50,238
I guess you would like to see
the house before it gets dark.

99
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:54,446
- I'll get the truck so you can follow me.
- That's all right, I remember the way.

100
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:59,162
Thank you.

101
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:02,794
There you are. I'll see you tomorrow.

102
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,082
- See you then.
- Bye-bye, Grandpa.

103
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:07,601
- Good to see you, Matt.
- Bye, Grandpa.

104
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,802
Matt, all aboard.

105
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,721
All right, come on.

106
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:35,206
Wow, is that our farm?
It's beautiful!

107
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:38,120
No, sweetie, we're up the road.

108
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,245
Wouldn't you know, it's starting to rain.

109
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,395
No way, this is it?

110
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:16,558
Don't worry, it'll be better inside.

111
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:25,801
Wait, let me turn on the light.

112
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,961
Great. Doesn't work.

113
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:33,046
Here you go, sweetie.
Be careful, Matt.

114
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,197
There's a note.

115
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,443
What?

116
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,398
It's from Len.

117
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:44,605
"The electricity went down in a storm,
should be back in a couple of weeks."

118
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:48,475
"Sorry for the mess.
I tidied up the best I could. Len."

119
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:52,196
- So there's no TV?
- No, Matt, there's no TV.

120
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,961
That's means there's no MTV.
Oh, great, really great.

121
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:58,119
- Why don't we just kill ourselves?
- Matt...

122
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,238
Take my hand, sweetie.

123
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:07,957
Watch your step there.

124
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,835
Let's take a look upstairs.

125
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:25,082
This bed seems OK. We'll use sleeping
bags until we get the sheets unpacked.

126
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:29,923
- Why bother?
- You and I are going to unload the car.

127
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:34,597
- Hey, don't forget this.
- Great! No pavement!

128
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,998
What'll I do with this? What kind
of kid would want to live here?

129
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:41,364
It wasn't so bad for your mother!

130
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:55,077
- Could this be my room, Laura?
- I don't think anyone will fight you for it.

131
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,884
Yes!

132
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:01,205
Which room do you want, Matt?

133
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:22,195
Still raining.

134
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:26,725
- About what I said outside...
- Forget it, it was nothing.

135
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,196
No?

136
00:16:30,807 --> 00:16:33,274
You know...

137
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:39,596
...after your mother died, I made a point
not to talk about her in front of you,

138
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,360
because I could see
how much it upset you.

139
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,200
I don't know if that was
the right thing to do.

140
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,721
I know we can't bring her back,

141
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:52,038
but that doesn't mean
we need to forget her.

142
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,315
Goodnight, son.

143
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,478
- Dad, are you going to tuck me in?
- I'll be right there.

144
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:22,559
- You, too, Laura.
- OK, sweetheart. I'm coming up.

145
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,321
Well, everybody wants a dog,
I let the dog out.

146
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:50,442
That's all right. Come on.

147
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:01,234
Oh, my...

148
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,837
Cool!

149
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:58,882
- Pots and pans.
- OK, that's a start.

150
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:01,766
All right, I'm off.

151
00:19:01,926 --> 00:19:05,442
- When I'm back, we'll go to the store.
- Have a good meeting.

152
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:08,166
- You've got breakfast?
- Five boxes of Pop-Tarts.

153
00:19:08,326 --> 00:19:11,443
- We don't have a toaster.
- Get out of here.

154
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:15,042
I'll call you later
and let you know how it goes.

155
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:19,476
- We don't have a phone.
- Honey, it's going to be fine.

156
00:19:19,646 --> 00:19:21,557
I know.

157
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,876
- See you later.
- OK.

158
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:31,356
Jennifer and I are going for a walk,
do you want to come?

159
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:39,084
It's not like the city, you know.

160
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,840
We'll both be short on friends here.

161
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:20,363
What do you want?

162
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:26,123
Hey, come on, cut it out.

163
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,798
Look, I said cut it out!

164
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,915
Hey! Hey!

165
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:39,159
Come back here!

166
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:41,238
Come on, give me those!

167
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:47,444
Drop those! Drop those right now!

168
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:51,486
I'm going to kill you!
Give me my headphones!

169
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:01,205
Wait a minute!

170
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:04,164
Stay! Stay!

171
00:21:05,686 --> 00:21:07,803
Heel!

172
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:20,797
Give me those!
If you don't drop those...

173
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,238
Whoa!

174
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:37,400
How did you find this place?

175
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:48,638
Man, they got a rope here
and everything. Cool.

176
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,762
Looks cold!

177
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:10,726
That was awesome!
That was totally awesome!

178
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:13,002
I'm not kidding!

179
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:22,205
- Anything with that?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

180
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:28,637
Mr Jarman, since our last conversation,
I've worked out 3 preliminary options,

181
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,605
depending on how much
of the structure will remain.

182
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:36,045
- Based on your budget...
- That's what we need to talk about.

183
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:38,605
What?

184
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:46,520
Hi, Steve, how did it go?

185
00:22:47,126 --> 00:22:49,117
- They don't want it.
- What?

186
00:22:49,287 --> 00:22:52,563
- The new house, remodelling, nothing.
- Why?

187
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,684
He says he was running high credit
at the bank, way too high.

188
00:22:55,846 --> 00:23:00,682
The man just lost half his flock,
and insurance isn't going to pay for it.

189
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:06,398
Len, I pulled my kids out of school. This
was going to cover me for 6-9 months.

190
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:10,723
It's a lousy break.
It's a damn lousy break,

191
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:14,402
but you got you one job,
you'll get another.

192
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:17,479
- That or some other type of work.
- What other work?

193
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,842
In the store, I hear about things.

194
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:23,363
There's always folks needing help
fixing this or that.

195
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:28,806
You mean, being a handyman?
Len, I'm a builder, I'm a contractor.

196
00:23:57,047 --> 00:24:00,642
Stop! Don't shoot!
Hey, mister, that's my dog!

197
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:06,039
Don't worry. I think I know the difference
between a coyote and a collie.

198
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:12,720
Now, boys are another thing.

199
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:16,117
I don't often see one I don't know
on my land.

200
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:19,039
- Aren't lost, are you?
- No, I know my way.

201
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,039
- I'm staying down at the Collins farm.
- Collins?

202
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:25,994
I bet you had to dust the cobwebs
out of that place.

203
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:31,403
- Yeah, you're not kidding.
- Well, have a nice visit.

204
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:35,559
Thanks, but we're not visiting,
we're going to live there.

205
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:39,480
Live there?
Well, now that's good news.

206
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:43,401
I got two boys just about your age.
I'll send them around.

207
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:47,037
You tell your daddy
Sam Garland says welcome.

208
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:59,795
Went out hunting coyotes today...
Josh, pass this down to your mother.

209
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:04,324
I ran into a youngster who said they
was moving on to the Collins place.

210
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:08,958
That's all right. As long as they
don't mess around with our flock.

211
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:11,321
- Right, boys?
- They won't, sir.

212
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:16,002
- Me and Jim will take care of that.
- That's what I like to hear.

213
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:19,603
Sam, you mustn't encourage the boys
to do anything malicious...

214
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:23,680
Now, Mildred, who said anything
about malicious?

215
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:28,602
I just want my boys to keep an eye
on things. We need that pasture.

216
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:32,237
- You know what I mean, right, Jim?
- Yes, sir.

217
00:25:32,686 --> 00:25:35,917
- Josh, you know what I'm talking about?
- Yes, sir.

218
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:41,916
Mildred, you're a wonderful cook.

219
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:45,164
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?

220
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:47,795
They've gone under.

221
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:51,635
- And you want to stay anyway?
- Where are we going to go, Laura?

222
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:54,275
- Home.
- There's no such thing any more.

223
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:58,804
- I could get my job back at the bank.
- I could get other work here.

224
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,241
- Doing what?
- I'll find something.

225
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:04,479
Honey, look... I don't want
the kids to grow up in the city.

226
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,558
I'd like them to see the sky,
hear the birds, not that noise.

227
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:11,878
I'd like them to walk home at night
and not worry what's behind them.

228
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:16,403
- Am I really wrong to feel that way?
- No, of course not.

229
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:24,719
- Don't worry. They'll think you're cool.
- Really?

230
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:26,605
Yeah.

231
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:32,636
Class, we have a brand new student
in grade 8 that's just moved to the area.

232
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:38,757
Matt Turner doesn't know anyone here,
so I want us all to make him welcome.

233
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:47,199
And now April will give us a grade 9
presentation of her 4-H Club project.

234
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:51,125
Jim, Josh, stop that.

235
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,637
This is Charlotte,
a 6-month-old Toggenburg goat,

236
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:59,366
who I helped birth
and then disbudded at one week.

237
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:03,201
Toggenburgs are the oldest registered
breed of any animal in the world.

238
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:08,963
They're light brown with white accents
and are excellent milk producers.

239
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:12,596
Thank you, April. That was
a very imaginative demonstration.

240
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:16,442
I'd like to encourage the rest of you
to accompany their science projects...

241
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:19,758
...with practical demonstrations
like the one April presented.

242
00:27:19,926 --> 00:27:23,124
Now, if you turn in your books
to chapter 17...

243
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:26,724
How are you doing, girl?

244
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:30,003
Can you believe that?
Show-and-tell with a goat?

245
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,202
I can't believe I live here!

246
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:37,361
You know what would happen at my
old school if I put a goat on a desk?

247
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:40,559
Hey, wait up!
I'm not a dog, you know.

248
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,644
Are you sure
this is the right way back?

249
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:51,682
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Probably through those trees.

250
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:55,483
Come on, this isn't funny.

251
00:27:56,326 --> 00:28:00,240
Is this the only trick you know?
Give me back my bag!

252
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:06,364
Come on, wait up, will you!

253
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:12,395
I told you, it's not funny!
Give me my bag.

254
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,286
You like making me chase you,
don't you?

255
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:23,285
Hey, come on, quit it.

256
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:27,163
There it is.

257
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:31,084
It doesn't look like such
a dump from up here.

258
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:41,116
"AC"...That's my mom!

259
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:45,118
AC, that's my mom,
Anne Collins.

260
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,915
How did you know?

261
00:28:57,406 --> 00:29:02,162
Once we get the weeds out, we could
have flowers, some geraniums...

262
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:06,957
And over here would be a great place
for a vegetable garden.

263
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:11,436
- A garden?
- Yeah.

264
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:17,397
- What do you know about gardening?
- Not a thing.

265
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:27,924
Hi, Steve... Laura.

266
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:32,079
I told you I'd hear
about some work, and I have.

267
00:29:32,247 --> 00:29:36,923
At the Walker ranch they're repairing
all the outbuildings and the fences.

268
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:39,759
They'll furnish all the tools,
you won't have to bring a thing.

269
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:43,760
- Repairing fences...
- Well, that's all there is for now.

270
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:50,083
No, I understand.
Well, at least I'll be outside.

271
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:57,920
- Your apple pie is great, Laura.
- In celebration of good old electricity.

272
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:03,602
- What is this thing?
- It looks like an old record player.

273
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:07,080
Are these old CDs?

274
00:30:07,767 --> 00:30:11,520
No, sweetie, these are 45s.

275
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:15,124
Let's see if this thing works.

276
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:19,080
- Did you try plugging it in?
- Yeah.

277
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:24,798
"Proud Mary"..."Jimmy Mack"...I used
to listen to these when I was a kid.

278
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:29,403
Those records were your mom's.
She used to play them all day long.

279
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,525
Just like Matt
with his head attachment.

280
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:46,286
I know this one. Mom used
to sing it to us. Remember, Matt?

281
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:51,165
There are places I remember

282
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:56,124
All my life, though some have changed

283
00:30:56,287 --> 00:31:00,121
Some forever, not for better

284
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:05,203
Some have gone and some remain

285
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:09,758
All these places have their moments

286
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:13,760
With lovers and friends
I still can recall

287
00:31:13,926 --> 00:31:18,442
Some are dead and some are living

288
00:31:18,606 --> 00:31:23,396
In my life, I've loved them all...

289
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:53,242
What, you can't find it?

290
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:58,565
What is it?

291
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:03,205
I'm coming.

292
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:06,719
What is it, girl?
What are you looking at, girl?

293
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:19,919
It's my mom's diary.

294
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,875
Thanks, Lassie.

295
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:27,597
"April 23..."

296
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,884
"Today I got up early and rode Lucky
through the high pasture,"

297
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:33,321
"all the way to the mountain pool."

298
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:36,604
It was too cold to swim,
so we sat there for a while,

299
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:39,804
I forgot about the time
and was almost late for school.

300
00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:45,601
On Saturday, Dad let me help him
split wood and showed me

301
00:32:45,767 --> 00:32:49,999
how to mend the goat pen and put up
the new wire in the chicken coop.

302
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:54,444
Mom said, "What are you teaching
her to use axe and hammer for?"

303
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:59,634
Daddy said, "So she can take the
place over some day, if she wants to. "

304
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:03,083
"Maybe raise her own kids here. "

305
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,955
I didn't tell Mom then,
but that's just what I want,

306
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:10,163
have a real sheep farm some day,
right here.

307
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:14,161
After all, we've got some
of the best grazing land around.

308
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:19,162
Of course I'll need to get a sheepdog,
I already know what kind, a collie.

309
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:22,079
I think I'll name it Lass...

310
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:29,599
Sing me the one
about the mockingbird.

311
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:32,644
Oh, I think I know that one.

312
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:36,516
Hush, little baby, don't say a word

313
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:40,843
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird

314
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:45,838
And if that mockingbird don't sing

315
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:49,760
Daddy's gonna buy you
a diamond ring

316
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:54,159
And if that diamond ring don't shine

317
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:58,843
Daddy's gonna buy you...
something nice.

318
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:06,125
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

319
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:33,643
Lassie, believe me, you don't
want to go out in that storm.

320
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,237
Lassie?

321
00:36:39,126 --> 00:36:41,163
No, Lassie!

322
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,557
Good girl!

323
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:21,443
Quiet, girl. Don't wake them up.

324
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:25,086
Come on, girl.

325
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:36,961
You're a pretty brave dog.

326
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:39,003
What happened?

327
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:42,603
- Nothing, Jen. Go back to bed.
- She's hurt.

328
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:47,405
She's fine.
Help me dry her off.

329
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:54,315
Hey, I told you to be quiet.

330
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,838
Hey, I thought I told you
to be quiet, too.

331
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:28,596
What did you think of the flip, Lassie?
Not bad, huh?

332
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:32,760
Are you kidding? That was great.
Where did you learn how to do that?

333
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:36,556
- That's no big deal.
- Yeah? You can't do it.

334
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:40,083
- How do you know, dung head?
- Because I know you're a spaz.

335
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,036
You're Matt, right?

336
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:48,960
"Let's all make Matt real welcome,
because he doesn't know anybody here."

337
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:51,163
- Knock it off, Jim.
- What?

338
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:57,554
I'm April Porter.
This is Jim and Josh Garland.

339
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:01,916
- You're from the Collins farm, right?
- Yeah.

340
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:05,875
- What a hole!
- We like it OK.

341
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:09,356
- Can you do a back flip?
- Sure.

342
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:13,235
- Let's see.
- Yeah, maybe some other time.

343
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:16,126
- Come on, do it!
- He can't do it.

344
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:21,041
- I can do it, I just don't want to.
- Yeah, right. He just doesn't want to.

345
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:38,918
Our dad is the biggest sheep farmer
in the whole state.

346
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:43,675
My folks are going away this weekend.
Why not come over Saturday night?

347
00:39:44,246 --> 00:39:47,762
- We're going to rent some cool videos.
- I don't think so, Josh.

348
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,804
My parents already have other plans.

349
00:39:51,887 --> 00:39:55,197
Wait till you see our place.

350
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:59,358
Now this is a real farm.

351
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:04,081
Stay here, Lassie.
I'll only be a minute.

352
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,963
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

353
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:16,637
You have a swimming pool
in your living room.

354
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:20,684
- You like guns?
- Yeah, I guess.

355
00:40:21,327 --> 00:40:25,717
Look at that.
Bolt-Action.22. It's mine.

356
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:29,402
You get all this from raising sheep?

357
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,717
Sure do.
"Warm, durable American wool."

358
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:35,923
- We know the motto, Jim.
- Well, he doesn't.

359
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:41,715
I'm coming, girl.

360
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:48,001
Lassie?
Where did you go?

361
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:50,681
Lassie!

362
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,844
There she is.

363
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:59,320
Bringing in a stray.
As good as any sheepdog.

364
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:01,998
Good girl, Lassie.

365
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:05,715
Hey, Matt... Ever seen
so many lamb chops on a hoof?

366
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:08,195
- Josh!
- April's so sensitive.

367
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:12,041
They're not pets, April.
Just wool and good eating.

368
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:16,436
I've got to go. Bye.

369
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:20,358
- Well, I'll see you guys around.
- Yeah. See you.

370
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:23,041
Come on, Lass!

371
00:41:24,806 --> 00:41:26,922
Come on, girl.

372
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:33,795
Big city guy's going to run off
with your girlfriend.

373
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:36,764
Shut up, lame-brain!

374
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:44,644
You stretch the wire,
you pound in the staple...

375
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:47,605
...and you go on to the next post.

376
00:41:55,047 --> 00:42:00,996
Stretch the wire, pound in the staple,
go on to the next post...

377
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,963
Oh, my God!

378
00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:05,356
I have a question:
what does 4-H mean?

379
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:10,043
It stems from...
"Head, Heart, Hands and Health."

380
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:12,675
"Head, Heart, Hands..."

381
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:15,235
- Well, see you.
- Bye.

382
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:18,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

383
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:26,996
"Twenty-five years of my life
and still..."

384
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,635
"...l'm trying to get up
that great big hill of..."

385
00:42:30,086 --> 00:42:31,405
"...hope!"

386
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,398
That was good.

387
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:40,036
Hey, where are you going?
Wait up!

388
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,242
Coyotes.

389
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:20,476
It'll be all right. It'll be fine.

390
00:43:21,007 --> 00:43:23,804
It's just sleeping.

391
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:27,844
Lassie, I don't know what to do.

392
00:43:28,487 --> 00:43:32,605
I'm not a vet.
Just forget about it.

393
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:44,878
All right...

394
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:58,717
Come on, Lass... Here.

395
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,876
Is April here?

396
00:44:18,686 --> 00:44:21,076
It's OK, Dad.

397
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:24,163
Hi...

398
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:29,364
I was wondering if you'd come over
to my house for a little while?

399
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:32,121
The thing is, I need some help.

400
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:35,282
It's in here.

401
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:43,844
- Will it be OK?
- I don't know.

402
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:48,117
Sometimes they can make it without
a mother, sometimes they can't.

403
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:51,085
It just depends on the sheep.

404
00:44:52,007 --> 00:44:57,161
Keep a blanket over it tonight, because
it'll probably get pretty cold in here.

405
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:00,523
I'll bring you some extra formula
tomorrow.

406
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:04,596
Yeah, you like that, don't you?
Yeah, you do.

407
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:10,115
I don't think it's hurt.
It just looks really hungry.

408
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:14,722
- You are from Baltimore, right?
- Yeah.

409
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:18,956
I've been there once.
It was cool.

410
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,358
- Thanks for coming over.
- Sure.

411
00:45:28,646 --> 00:45:31,480
- I better get going home.
- Yeah.

412
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,445
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Right.

413
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:53,842
- Matt, guess what!
- Not now, Jen.

414
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:56,840
- But guess what!
- What?

415
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:58,565
We're going home!

416
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:03,117
- Moving back?
- It's not definite, I'll know in a few days.

417
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:07,405
- What are you talking about?
- Your dad got a call about a good job.

418
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,206
In Baltimore. They've been trying
to reach him for a week.

419
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,802
That place I interviewed a month ago.
At the time, they didn't have anything.

420
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:19,166
- You don't have to take it, do you?
- No, but I need a hell of a reason not to.

421
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:24,400
- What about the job you have here?
- Mending fences at 5 dollars an hour?

422
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:27,320
Hey, what's going on?

423
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:31,923
- I thought you'd want to move back?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

424
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:37,922
Look, it doesn't matter
to me either way.

425
00:46:43,646 --> 00:46:47,036
I didn't tell Mom then, but that's just
what I want to do,

426
00:46:47,206 --> 00:46:51,324
have a real sheep farm some day,
right here.

427
00:46:57,407 --> 00:47:00,762
- What do you mean, how do they do it?
- You saw their ranch.

428
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:04,681
- They make a fortune. How?
- Well, they raise a lot of sheep.

429
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:07,918
- And that's it?
- Well, yeah...

430
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:11,795
- And they've got the best pasture.
- That's what I'm trying to say!

431
00:47:11,967 --> 00:47:15,402
- Now, where is this pasture-land?
- I don't know.

432
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:19,195
Down around Greenly's,
the whole high meadow. Why?

433
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:24,561
- Well, that's their flock, right?
- Yeah.

434
00:47:24,726 --> 00:47:27,719
- And this is their pasture-land, right?
- Right.

435
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:30,637
So what's that fence?

436
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:35,244
I come by every day, and there's no
other fence between here and our farm.

437
00:47:35,487 --> 00:47:40,800
I've seen their sheep grazing all over
here, all the way up to the creek.

438
00:47:41,686 --> 00:47:44,804
- All right, let's say that this is our land.
- I don't know.

439
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:49,916
Let's just say. Somebody has put
that fence here for something.

440
00:47:50,086 --> 00:47:52,442
You know, raising sheep
is not as easy as it looks.

441
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:55,916
- You need pens and sheepdogs...
- I've got the dog!

442
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:58,760
Lassie, go!
Round them up!

443
00:48:02,126 --> 00:48:04,686
Bring them here, girl!

444
00:48:24,606 --> 00:48:26,961
Good girl!

445
00:48:27,286 --> 00:48:30,597
This is our boundary, right?
Our farmhouse is right here.

446
00:48:30,766 --> 00:48:33,884
- I can read a plat map.
- All right, sorry.

447
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,925
- This is the Garlands' ranch.
- Yeah, I've seen it.

448
00:48:37,086 --> 00:48:41,603
And whose land are they using? Ours.
They've got sheep all over that pasture.

449
00:48:41,766 --> 00:48:46,965
- It's the best grazing land in the area.
- If it's done right, you can make money.

450
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:51,599
300 ewes and 20 rams, by the end
of next year you have 450 sheep.

451
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:54,565
- What's going on?
- Your brother just lost his mind.

452
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:56,603
You should see the Garlands' ranch...

453
00:48:56,766 --> 00:49:00,918
I'm a contractor. I don't know the first
thing about farming, neither do you.

454
00:49:01,086 --> 00:49:05,922
- Grandpa does.
- I'm no expert, but I know the basics.

455
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:10,717
With the animals and the construction,
that's doing labour ourselves,

456
00:49:10,887 --> 00:49:15,358
we could probably get started
for 30-35,000.

457
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:18,518
I'm sorry, Matt. I'd be lucky
to cover half of that.

458
00:49:18,686 --> 00:49:21,440
If you'd be willing, I'd be glad
to put up the other half.

459
00:49:21,606 --> 00:49:24,485
That's very generous of you,
but we couldn't ask you to do that.

460
00:49:24,646 --> 00:49:30,039
Nothing generous about it. The fact is,
I'm kind of thinking about myself.

461
00:49:30,206 --> 00:49:33,960
I'd sure like to have
these grandkids around me.

462
00:49:34,126 --> 00:49:37,277
You want to stay here?

463
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:44,202
Yeah.

464
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:46,755
Yeah, I really do.

465
00:49:47,726 --> 00:49:50,684
What do you think we should do?

466
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
I wish I knew.

467
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,760
Come on...

468
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:10,275
- Let me try.
- OK, just don't tilt the bottle too much.

469
00:50:14,606 --> 00:50:17,246
- Come on, you're drowning the thing.
- I am not.

470
00:50:17,407 --> 00:50:18,726
That's enough.

471
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:22,722
That's done. Don't worry,
I've got another one.

472
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:26,081
There you go.

473
00:50:29,887 --> 00:50:32,525
Well, I hope you're not driving.

474
00:50:33,606 --> 00:50:35,882
Me, too.

475
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:43,914
That's the whole flock. I brought them
down from the high pasture on Friday.

476
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:46,601
So, how many is that?

477
00:50:46,766 --> 00:50:49,804
That's 380 ewes and 34 rams.

478
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:54,643
380 and 34, that's just about right
for the land we got.

479
00:50:55,206 --> 00:50:57,038
How much?

480
00:50:57,206 --> 00:51:00,244
Like I said on the phone,
I don't know about this.

481
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:03,398
Sam Garland said he might be
interested in the whole flock.

482
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:06,559
So are we.
What's he offering?

483
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:09,844
We talked about 57 a head
for the ewes.

484
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:12,918
We'd like to offer you
60 dollars a head, Pete.

485
00:51:13,086 --> 00:51:15,885
Well, 60 is fair.

486
00:51:16,047 --> 00:51:18,958
- I'd say so.
- More than fair.

487
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:22,684
- But Garland was here first.
- I don't understand the problem.

488
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:25,679
We'd like the whole flock,
we're offering 3 dollars more.

489
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:29,965
It's all right, Mr Jarman.
We respect your position.

490
00:51:30,126 --> 00:51:34,563
I'm sure you and Sam Garland go
way back, and he'd do the same for you.

491
00:51:34,726 --> 00:51:37,639
I hope we didn't take up
too much of your time.

492
00:51:40,126 --> 00:51:42,163
Come on.

493
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:51,764
I'm sorry we couldn't work
something out, Pete.

494
00:51:54,646 --> 00:51:58,525
Honey!
Honey, what are you doing?

495
00:51:58,686 --> 00:52:01,918
Don't worry. He's pressuring
himself more than we ever will.

496
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,157
Hey, hold up a minute.

497
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:10,282
The flock is yours
if you can pay today.
