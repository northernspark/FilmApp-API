Mr. Galt here says you're real well-informed on what happens around here.

641
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,731
You saying I did it?

642
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:06,526
I asked if you knew anything about it, not if you did it.

643
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:11,615
The crime has been solved, son. Mexican police picked up two armed drifters...

644
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,035
...from the state of Florida across the border. Handed them over.

645
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,871
They ain't confessed yet, but they will.

646
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,166
I just can't get past the idea...

647
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:25,629
...that maybe one of these two bootleg gangs had something to do with it.

648
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,924
I learned a long time ago to trust my instincts.

649
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,345
Now listen real careful, because here is the point, son.

650
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,514
Things in this town are out of control.

651
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,435
Two gangs is just one too many.

652
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,520
I'm not an idealist.

653
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,399
I know a lot of things that people do are awful low...

654
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:49,444
...but that's between them and God.

655
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:52,155
Do you believe in God?

656
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,659
I believe in God, son.

657
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,579
But what I'm concerned with is keeping a lid on things.

658
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:03,917
And what we got here in Jericho is just way out of hand.

659
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,920
And Sheriff Galt here, he can't do much about it, right?

660
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:11,216
Matter of fact, it might be fair to say he's part of the problem, right?

661
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:15,762
Now, you been going back and forth playing both sides according to Mr. Galt here.

Well, it's over, son.

664

I'm coming back here in 10 days.

665
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:28,608
I'm gonna bring about 20 rangers with me.

666
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:32,404
I will tolerate one gang because that is the nature of things.

667

A certain amount of corruption is inevitable.

668
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,701
But if I find two gangs here when I get back...

669
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,287
...then in a couple of hours, there will be no gangs here.

670
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,958
So it's simple.

671
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,127
One gang quits and goes home.

Just so long as one side leaves, or maybe one side loses.

674
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,807
That's fine too, son. Kill as many as you want.

I'm just gonna watch.

1124
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,564
I don't wanna die in Texas.

1125
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,899
Chicago maybe.

1126
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:20,571
You can meet me there if you want, and try and kill me.

1127
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,543
Maybe you're the kind of guy...

1128
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:37,129
...that would shoot an unarmed man in the back.

1129
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:39,340
Done worse than that.

1130
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:01,570
SMITH: I can't say it all went exactly the way I planned.

1131
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:04,948
But I was right about one thing.

1132
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:08,952
They were all better off dead.

1133
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:21,840
JOE: Goddamn, I wasn't real sure this old gun would still shoot.

1134
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:27,304
SMITH: Looks like you got yourself a new car.

1135
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,577
SMITH: And that was it.

1136
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:53,997
It ended about the same place where it started.

1137
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:57,167
Out in the desert on the road to Mexico.

1138
01:35:57,502 --> 01:36:00,546
And I was just as broke as when I arrived.

1139
01:36:00,964 --> 01:36:03,173
But something would turn up.

1140
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:05,175
It always does.
