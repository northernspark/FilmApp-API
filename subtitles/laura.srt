00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:09,168
I shall never forget
the weekend Laura died.

3
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:14,723
A silver sun burned through the sky
like a huge magnifying glass.

4
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:18,839
It was the hottest Sunday
in my recollection.

5
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:22,796
I felt as if I were the only human being
left in New York.

6
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:27,872
For with Laura's
horrible death, I was alone.

7
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:32,108
I, Waldo Lydecker...

8
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,066
was the only one
who really knew her...

9
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:40,501
and I had just begun
to write Laura's story when...

10
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,738
another of those detectives
came to see me.

11
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:46,656
I had him wait.

12
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:52,292
I could watch him
through the half-open door.

13
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:08,118
I noted that his attention
was fixed upon my clock.

14
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:11,595
There was only one other
in existence...

15
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:14,233
and that was
in Laura's apartment...

16
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:17,111
in the very room
where she was murdered.

17
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:23,866
Careful there.
That stuff is priceless.

18
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:26,902
Come in here, please.

19
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,216
Mr. Lydecker?

20
00:02:35,336 --> 00:02:37,574
Ah, you recognize me.
How splendid.

21
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:39,572
Sit down, please.

22
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,648
Nice little place
you have here, Mr. Lydecker.

23
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:47,765
It's lavish,
but I call it home.

24
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:50,803
I suppose you're here
about the Laura Hunt murder.

25
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,041
Yesterday morning,
after Laura's body was found...

26
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:56,278
I was questioned
by Sergeants McAvity and Schultz...

27
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:58,237
and I stated...

28
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:01,354
"On Friday night, Laura had a dinner
engagement with me...

29
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:04,631
"after which she was ostensibly
going out of town.

30
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,707
"She phoned and canceled
our engagement at exactly 7:00.

31
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,666
- After that I..."
- You "ate a lonely dinner...

32
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:13,864
then got into the tub to read."

33
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,782
Why did you
write it down?

34
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,020
Afraid you'd forget it?

35
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,537
I am the most widely
misquoted man in America.

36
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:24,055
When my friends do it,
I resent it.

37
00:03:24,135 --> 00:03:27,372
From Sergeants McAvity and Schultz,
I should find it intolerable.

38
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:30,050
Hand me that washcloth,
please, Mr. -

39
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,249
Mr. -

40
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,167
McPherson.

41
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,885
McPherson. McPherson.

42
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,602
Mark McPherson-
the siege of Babylon, Long Island.

43
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:42,000
The gangster with the machine gun.
Killed three policemen.

44
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,438
I told the story over the air
and wrote a column about it.

45
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,436
Are you the one
with the leg full of lead...

46
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:48,714
- the man who walked right in and got him?
- Yeah.

47
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,433
Well, well.
Hand me my robe, please.

48
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:58,226
You have a pretty good memory,
Mr. Lydecker.

49
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:01,984
I always liked that detective
with the silver shinbone.

50
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:06,140
Thanks. I hope you won't have any reason
to change your mind about me.

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,057
- Have you any more questions?
- Yeah, just one.

52
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:11,495
Two years ago,
in your October 17 column...

53
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:13,653
you started out
to write a book review...

54
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:17,171
but at the bottom of the column, you
switched over to the Harrington murder case.

55
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,288
Are the processes of the creative mind
now under the jurisdiction of the police?

56
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:25,964
You said Harrington was rubbed out with
a shotgun loaded with buckshot...

57
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:28,681
the way Laura Hunt was murdered
night before last.

58
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,600
- Did I?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,557
But he was really killed
with a sash weight.

60
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:37,394
How ordinary.
My version was obviously superior.

61
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:39,393
I never bother
with details, you know.

62
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:42,270
I do. Well, so long.

63
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:45,627
Mind if I go with you?

64
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:48,985
- What for?
- Murder is my favorite crime.

65
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:51,023
I write about it regularly...

66
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,060
and I know you'll have to visit everyone
on your list of suspects.

67
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:57,058
I'd like to study
their reactions.

68
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:59,815
- You're on the list yourself, you know.
- Good.

69
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:03,212
To have overlooked me
would have been a pointed insult.

70
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:06,849
You're not the sort of man
one would insult, Mr. Lydecker.

71
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,767
- Do you really suspect me?
- Yes.

72
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:13,683
McPherson, if you know anything
about faces, look at mine.

73
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:19,119
How singularly innocent
I look this morning.

74
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,076
Have you ever seen
such candid eyes?

75
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,630
Something you confiscated
in a raid on a kindergarten?

76
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,747
Takes a lot of control.
Would you like to try it?

77
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,105
No, thanks.

78
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:38,863
Were you in love
with Laura Hunt, Mr. Lydecker?

79
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,659
Was she in love with you?

80
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:46,017
Laura considered me
the wisest, the wittiest...

81
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,014
the most interesting man
she'd ever met.

82
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,696
I was in complete accord
with her on that point.

83
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:54,660
She thought me also
the kindest...

84
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:56,821
the gentlest...

85
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,223
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

86
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:01,786
Did you agree
with her there too?

87
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:04,147
McPherson,
you won't understand this...

88
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:08,752
but I tried to become
the kindest, the gentlest...

89
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:11,834
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

90
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,277
Have any luck?

91
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:17,400
Let me put it this way.

92
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,804
I should be sincerely sorry to see my
neighbors' children devoured by wolves.

93
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,805
Shall we go?

94
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:48,308
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Treadwell.

95
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:50,230
- Waldo.
- Good morning, Ann.

96
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,472
- I've just taken over the Laura Hunt case.
- Won't you sit down?

97
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,794
Thanks. I have
all the reports...

98
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,116
but there are a few more questions
I'd like to ask.

99
00:06:58,236 --> 00:07:00,119
Certainly. I'll do anything
I can to help.

100
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:02,160
You were fond of your niece,
Mrs. Treadwell?

101
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,162
Why, I adored her.
Cigarette?

102
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:07,005
No, thanks. You collapsed when
you identified the body.

103
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,969
I can quite understand that. A shotgun
loaded with buckshot, close range.

104
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,051
- It's not very nice to look at.
- It was horrible.

105
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:16,653
Her maid Bessie, I suppose
she was devoted to Miss Hunt?

106
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:19,897
Oh, she worshipped her.
Laura had had her for years.

107
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:22,979
I'll never forget her scream
when she saw Laura lying there.

108
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,863
Did you approve of Miss Hunt's coming
marriage to Mr. Carpenter?

109
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:30,426
Why? Shouldn't I approve?

110
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:34,430
I don't know. What is your relationship
with Mr. Carpenter?

111
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,431
What do you mean?

112
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:39,394
What I mean is, he's been
a frequent guest in your home.

113
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:42,076
Is he an acquaintance? Friend?
Are you in love with him?

114
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:44,358
This is beginning to assume
fabulous aspects.

115
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,081
Oh, shut up, Waldo!
What are you driving at?

116
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:49,844
The truth, Mrs. Treadwell.
Are you in love with him?

117
00:07:52,085 --> 00:07:55,888
Why, no. I'm... I'm very fond
of Mr. Carpenter, of course.

118
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,211
- Everybody is.
- I'm not. I'll be hanged if I am.

119
00:07:58,331 --> 00:08:00,573
Oh, don't be
so annoying, Waldo!

120
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:02,575
Did you give
Mr. Carpenter money?

121
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:06,579
- What do you mean?
- A couple of checks went through your account endorsed by him.

122
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:11,223
One on May 15 for $250.
One on May 22 for $400.

123
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:14,386
Oh, that. I...

124
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:17,068
I asked him to do
some shopping for me. That's all.

125
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:19,070
Shelby's a very obliging fellow.

126
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,753
For some time, also, you've been
withdrawing various amounts in cash.

127
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,836
Sometimes 1,500.

128
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,757
Sometimes 1,700 at a clip.

129
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:30,040
Yes. I needed that money.

130
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:36,326
The day you took out $1,500,
Mr. Carpenter deposited 1,350.

131
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:39,568
When you withdrew 1,700,
he deposited 1,550.

132
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,571
Maybe they were shooting crap.

133
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,092
Oh, must I be insulted like this?

134
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:50,218
I'm sorry, Mrs. Treadwell, but I have
to find out about these things.

135
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:54,783
Shelby needed some money, and I lent it to
him. That's all. After all, it is my money.

136
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:57,304
- I suppose I can do as I please with it.
- Sure. Of course.

137
00:08:57,424 --> 00:09:00,268
Now, on Friday night, Mrs. Treadwell,
you stayed home alone all evening?

138
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:03,270
- Yes.
- Why didn't you go to the concert with Shelby?

139
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:06,393
Because he didn't ask me.

140
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:08,475
We were just talking
about you, Carpenter.

141
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:11,317
- What a coincidence to find you here.
- This is Lieutenant McPherson.

142
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:14,840
- Oh, how do you do, Lieutenant?
- I didn't know you were here, Mr. Carpenter.

143
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,442
As a matter of fact,
I was just lying down here.

144
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:21,086
My hotel room was so hot, and then all
the people and reporters and telephone.

145
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,048
You know how it is,
Lieutenant.

146
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:25,850
I've hardly slept a wink
since it happened.

147
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:28,453
Is that a sign of guilt or innocence,
McPherson?

148
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:31,976
I'm at your disposal, Lieutenant. I'm as
eager to find the murderer as you are.

149
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:34,459
But what possible motive
could I have for killing Laura?

150
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:37,341
Miss Hunt and I were going to be married
this week, you know.

151
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,422
No, he doesn't know,
and neither do I...

152
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:42,866
- or you or anyone else alive.
- What do you mean by that?

153
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:45,868
Laura had not definitely made up
her mind to marry him.

154
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:49,792
She told me so herself last Friday when she
called up to cancel our dinner engagement.

155
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:53,275
As a matter of fact, she was going
to the country to think it over.

156
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:55,678
She was extremely kind,
but I was always sure...

157
00:09:55,757 --> 00:09:59,842
she would never have thrown her life
away on a male beauty in distress.

158
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:01,923
I suppose you've heard
losers whine before...

159
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:03,925
especially in your
profession, eh?

160
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,847
Would you like
a bite of lunch, Lieutenant?

161
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,889
That's very thoughtful...
the perfect host.

162
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,211
- Waldo.
- You'd almost think he was in his own home.

163
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,493
Shelby knows how distracted I am.
Would you, Lieutenant?

164
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,896
Thank you, Mrs. Treadwell,
but I've got to be going.

165
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:19,579
But, Lieutenant, I... Well, I rather thought
you'd want to ask me some questions.

166
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:22,822
Oh, yes. What did they play
at the concert Friday night?

167
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:25,544
Oh, Brahms's First
and Beethoven's Ninth.

168
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:28,867
Uh-huh. Have you got a key
to Miss Hunt's house up in the country?

169
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:31,630
No, but I think there's one
up in her apartment.

170
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,112
- Okay, I'll have a look.
- Perhaps I could help you?

171
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:36,074
All right. Come along.

172
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:38,516
I'll be seeing you,
Mrs. Treadwell.

173
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,563
Extra! Extra!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

174
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,924
Extra! Girl victim
in brutal slaying!

175
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:50,447
Read all about it!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

176
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,129
Girl victim
in brutal slaying! Read all about it!

177
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:00,296
All right.
Break it up. Break it up.

178
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,298
Ice-cold drinks!

179
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,525
- The doorbell rang.
- What?

180
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,767
As she opened the door,
the shot was fired.

181
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,769
And how do you deduce that?

182
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,772
She fell backward.
The body was there.

183
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,976
I thought you hadn't
been up here before.

184
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:45,938
I saw the police photos.

185
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:56,867
I guess I better
try and find that key.

186
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,112
McPherson, tell me, why did they have to
photograph her in that horrible condition?

187
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:04,755
When a dame gets killed,
she doesn't worry about how she looks.

188
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,637
Will you stop calling her a dame?
Look around.

189
00:12:09,118 --> 00:12:11,280
Is this the home of a dame?

190
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,884
Look at her.

191
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:20,208
Not bad.

192
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:23,131
Jacoby was in love with her
when he painted it...

193
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:25,333
but he never captured
her vibrance, her warmth.

194
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:29,577
Have you ever been in love?

195
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:32,537
A doll in Washington Heights
once got a fox fur out of me.

196
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:35,899
Ever know a woman who wasn't
a "doll" or a "dame"?

197
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:41,540
Yeah, one, but she kept walking me
past furniture windows...

198
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,660
to look at the parlor suites.

199
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,381
- Would you mind turning that off?
- Why? Don't you like it?

200
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:51,102
It was one of Laura's favorites.
Not exactly classical, but sweet.

201
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:54,023
- You know a lot about music?
- I don't know a lot about anything...

202
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,103
but I know a little
about practically everything.

203
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:58,223
Yeah? Then why did you say...

204
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:02,224
they played Brahms's First and Beethoven's
Ninth at the concert Friday night?

205
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:05,425
They changed the program at the last
minute and played nothing but Sibelius.

206
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:07,866
I suppose I should have
told you in the first place.

207
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:10,426
I'd been working on that
advertising campaign with Laura.

208
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:13,667
Well, we'd been working so hard, I...
I just couldn't keep my eyes open.

209
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:16,228
I didn't hear a note at the concert.
I fell asleep.

210
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:19,108
Next he'll produce
photographic evidence of his dreams.

211
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:22,109
I know it sounds suspicious,
but I'm resigned to that by now.

212
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:25,629
I'm a natural-born suspect just because
I'm not the conventional type.

213
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,870
I wouldn't worry about it,
Mr. Carpenter.

214
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,191
It sounds reasonable.
I fall asleep at concerts myself.

215
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:33,152
Thank you.

216
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,952
You found
that key yet?

217
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:40,273
No. I looked for it in the den,
but it wasn't there. It may be in here.

218
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:48,954
Yes, here it is.

219
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:51,396
I knew there must be
one around somewhere.

220
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:53,876
The police are very fussy
about their inventories.

221
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:57,237
That key isn't on the list of things
that were in that drawer yesterday.

222
00:13:57,316 --> 00:13:59,717
Then it's made
a recent reappearance.

223
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,997
You put it there,
didn't you?

224
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:04,398
- Yes.
- Why?

225
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:07,598
It's just that I didn't want to give it
to you while Waldo was present.

226
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:10,280
- Oh.
- I have private reasons that don't concern him.

227
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,200
Everything about Laura
concerns me.

228
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,041
You have private reasons,
no doubt, to lie about the key.

229
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,041
Waldo, for your own good,
I'm warning you to stop implying...

230
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:21,322
that I had anything to do
with Laura's death.

231
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,723
Very well.
I'll stop implying.

232
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:25,643
I'll make
a direct statement.

233
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:27,563
All right,
you asked for it.

234
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:30,444
I wouldn't.

235
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,925
Will you please stop dawdling
with that infernal puzzle?

236
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:37,125
- It's getting on my nerves.
- I know, but it keeps me calm.

237
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:39,206
Okay, let's go.

238
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,169
This was our table...

239
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,170
Laura's and mine.

240
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,531
We spent many quiet evenings
here together.

241
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:06,692
I remember we dined here the night
before her 22nd birthday.

242
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,973
Just we two...

243
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:13,694
happy, making plans
for her future.

244
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,775
- Good luck.
But this was a far cry...

245
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:22,415
from the girl who walked into my life
at the Algonquin Hotel five years before.

246
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:25,976
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

247
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,018
Excuse me.

248
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,620
Mr. Lydecker,
how do you do?

249
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,140
My name is Laura Hunt,
and I'm with Bullitt and Company.

250
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:47,421
You know,
the big advertising firm.

251
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,302
And I'd like to talk
something over with you, if I may.

252
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:54,423
You can hardly fail to realize that
I am engaged in eating my lunch.

253
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:58,144
Yes, I know. I'm awfully sorry
to interrupt this way...

254
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:01,185
but it's so hard to get to see you
the regular way, and...

255
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:03,185
this will only
take a minute, really.

256
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,946
- Now, this is...
- Young woman...

257
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:12,107
either you have been raised
in some incredibly rustic community...

258
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:14,067
where good manners
are unknown...

259
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,468
or you suffer from the common
feminine delusion...

260
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,469
that the mere fact
of being a woman...

261
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:21,389
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

262
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,389
Or possibly both.

263
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,150
Possibly, but here's
what I wanted to show you.

264
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,190
It's for
the Wallace Flow-Rite pen.

265
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:33,311
I know my company would be glad to pay
you $5,000 if you'll endorse the ad.

266
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,232
I don't use a pen.

267
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:37,352
I write with a goose quill
dipped in venom.

268
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:40,273
Yes, but this is a very fine pen,
Mr. Lydecker...

269
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:42,194
the best on the market.

270
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,834
Wouldn't you at least
consider endorsing it?

271
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:49,035
I'll neither consider, endorse
or use the Wallace pen.

272
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,236
I hate pens.

273
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:54,476
If your employers wish me to publish
that statement in my column...

274
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,157
you may tell them that I shall be
delighted to oblige.

275
00:16:57,277 --> 00:17:01,157
Oh, no.
You mustn't do that.

276
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:03,318
Don't blame Bullitt and Company,
Mr. Lydecker.

277
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:06,919
They don't know anything about this.
It was my idea to see you.

278
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,760
Indeed?

279
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,001
Yes. I know they'd give anything down
at the office to get your endorsement...

280
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,161
only they think
there's no use asking.

281
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:19,121
So I had this ad made up
all on my own...

282
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:22,562
because I thought, well,
what's the harm in trying?

283
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,923
There was always a chance
that you might, Mr. Lydecker.

284
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:26,843
Just think what
it would mean...

285
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,004
You seem to be completely disregarding
something more important than your career.

286
00:17:31,124 --> 00:17:33,645
- What?
- My lunch.

287
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:38,046
Do you really believe that?

288
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,526
Implicitly.

289
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:43,007
I never heard
of anything so selfish.

290
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:47,568
In my case, self-absorption
is completely justified.

291
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:50,968
I have never discovered any other
subject quite so worthy of my attention.

292
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:53,530
But you write about people...

293
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,810
with such real understanding
and sentiment.

294
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,251
That's what makes
your column so good.

295
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,611
Sentiment comes easily
at 50 cents a word.

296
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:07,172
Well, if that's the way
you really feel...

297
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:11,133
you must be very lonely.

298
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:15,014
Will you kindly continue
this character analysis elsewhere?

299
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:18,254
- You begin to bore me.
- You're a poor man.

300
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:20,375
I'm very sorry for you.

301
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,576
Naturally,
I was annoyed by the incident...

302
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,977
but she had something
about her, that girl.

303
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:34,058
I had to speak to her again.
I had to see her.

304
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:36,419
- Miss, would you mind if I...
- Just a moment, please.

305
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:38,739
I'll tell Mr. Bullitt right away.
He's on the telephone.

306
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,060
Thank you.

307
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:04,105
Boy, Waldo Lydecker
to see Miss Laura Hunt.

308
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:08,826
Announce me.

309
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:11,147
Johnny, please tell
the gentleman I'm busy.

310
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:19,429
Miss Hunt, I have something
to say to you.

311
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,869
You've already said it,
Mr. Lydecker.

312
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:25,470
I wish to point out that you caught me
at my most difficult moment.

313
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,191
Ordinarily I am not
without a heart.

314
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,111
Really?

315
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:32,592
Shall I produce
X-ray pictures to prove it?

316
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:38,033
I wish to apologize.

317
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:39,993
Your apology is accepted.

318
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,114
Good-bye, Mr. Lydecker.

319
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,354
If you come
a little bit closer, my boy...

320
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:48,875
I can just crack your skull
with my stick.

321
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,877
And now, for reasons
which are too embarrassing to mention...

322
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:58,837
I'd like to endorse that pen.

323
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:01,758
Mr. Lydecker!

324
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:03,758
Thank you.

325
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:09,160
- You're a very strange man.
- What?

326
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:13,120
You're really sorry
for the way you acted, aren't you?

327
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,601
Let's not be psychiatric,
Miss Hunt...

328
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:18,482
but in a word, yes.

329
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,642
It's very kind of you,
you know.

330
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:25,203
I'm not kind. I'm vicious.
It's the secret of my charm.

331
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,570
But if you choose
to think me kind...

332
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,498
I'll call for you at 6:00.

333
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,669
All right?

334
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:37,481
All right.

335
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,674
Her career began
with my endorsement of the pen.

336
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,392
I secured other endorsements for her...

337
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,169
introduced her
to important clients.

338
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:50,445
I gave her her start...

339
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:52,152
but it was her own talent
and imagination...

340
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,626
that enabled her to rise
to the top of her profession...

341
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:56,333
and stay there.

342
00:20:57,274 --> 00:21:00,062
She had an eager mind always.

343
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:03,199
She was always quick to seize upon
anything that would improve her mind...

344
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,941
or her appearance.

345
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:07,729
Laura had innate breeding.

346
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:14,036
But she deferred
to my judgment and taste.

347
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,312
I selected a more attractive
hairdress for her.

348
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,678
I taught her what clothes
were more becoming to her.

349
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,860
Through me, she met everyone.

350
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:29,194
The famous and the infamous.

351
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:32,888
Her youth and beauty, her poise
and charm of manner...

352
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:34,770
captivated them all.

353
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,000
She had warmth, vitality.

354
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,858
She had authentic magnetism.

355
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,900
Wherever we went,
she stood out.

356
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:47,245
Men admired her.
Women envied her.

357
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,765
She became as well known
as Waldo Lydecker's walking stick...

358
00:21:50,835 --> 00:21:52,716
and his white carnation.

359
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:55,504
But Tuesday and Friday nights
we stayed home...

360
00:21:55,574 --> 00:21:58,397
dining quietly,
listening to my records.

361
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:01,707
I read my articles to her.

362
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,320
The way she listened
was more eloquent than speech.

363
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:07,004
These were the best nights.

364
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:12,057
Then one Tuesday, she phoned
and said she couldn't come.

365
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:15,263
It didn't matter, really.

366
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:18,190
But when it happened again
the following Friday, I was disturbed.

367
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:23,174
I couldn't
understand it. I felt betrayed...

368
00:22:24,254 --> 00:22:26,449
and yet I knew Laura
would never betray anyone.

369
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,836
I walked for a long time.

370
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:38,610
Then I found myself
before her apartment building.

371
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:42,618
The lights were on.
It pleased me to know she was home...

372
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,360
till I saw she was not alone.

373
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,797
But I waited.
I wanted to see who he was.

374
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,383
It was Jacoby, who had recently
painted her portrait.

375
00:22:57,254 --> 00:22:58,822
I never liked the man.

376
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:03,213
He was so obviously conscious of looking
more like an athlete than an artist.

377
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:05,861
I sat up the rest of the night
writing a column about him.

378
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,534
I demolished his affectations...

379
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:10,391
exposed his camouflaged
imitations of better painters...

380
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:12,726
ridiculed his theories.

381
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:15,549
I did it for her,
knowing Jacoby was unworthy of her.

382
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,860
It was a masterpiece
because it was a labor of love.

383
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,613
Naturally, she could never
regard him seriously again.

384
00:23:22,797 --> 00:23:25,306
There were others,
of course...

385
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:27,048
but her own discrimination
ruled them out...

386
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:29,384
before it became necessary
for me to intercede...

387
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,530
until one night at a party
at Ann Treadwell's.

388
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:36,876
It was one of her usual roundups
of bizarre and nondescript characters...

389
00:23:36,945 --> 00:23:39,070
- corralled from every stratum of society.
- How are you this evening?

390
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:41,197
This is Mr. And Mrs. Preston.
They've been waiting to meet you.

391
00:23:41,266 --> 00:23:42,870
How do you do?

392
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:47,085
- Hello, Shelby.
- Excuse me, honey.

393
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:52,696
You're Laura Hunt.

394
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,728
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Shelby Carpenter.

395
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:58,550
- Want to dance?
- I'm not alone.

396
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,419
Oh, him? I'll bet
he's still doing the polka.

397
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:04,719
Excuse me, please. Yes.

398
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:06,391
Betsy Ross taught it to me.

399
00:24:06,461 --> 00:24:08,133
- Hello, Waldo. Darling, how are you?
- Hello, darling.

400
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,806
- I see you've met Shelby.
- Hello, Ann.

401
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:12,141
- Unavoidably.
- He was awfully nice to me in Louisville at the Derby.

402
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,162
His family's from Kentucky.

403
00:24:14,232 --> 00:24:15,904
Sharecroppers, no doubt.

404
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:22,665
Louise. Louise, for the last time,
will you marry me?

405
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:24,721
I won't, but I've saved
some chicken livers for you.

406
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:26,393
Oh, you're an angel.
In the meantime, darling...

407
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,380
you think you could
get this spot out for me?

408
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:30,680
I can afford a blemish on my character
but not on my clothes.

409
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:33,050
- Mmm. Couldn't eat another mouthful.
- I'm afraid it's rouge.

410
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:34,792
- I'm afraid it's liquor.
- Louise. Oh.

411
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:37,371
- May I have a glass of milk for Mr. Lydecker?
- Of course, Miss Hunt.

412
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,148
I forgot to tell you.
I also read palms.

413
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:42,528
I cook, I swallow swords, I mend my own
socks, I never eat garlic or onions.

414
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,200
What more can you want
of a man?

415
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:46,709
- Don't listen to that scalawag.
- I didn't expect to find him here, Louise.

416
00:24:46,815 --> 00:24:48,382
What do you mean?
We're old friends.

417
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,055
She feeds me,
humors me, repairs me...

418
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,833
and refuses to marry me,
don't you, honey?

419
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,540
- I do.
- She has good sense.

420
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,875
- Now, wait just a minute. Thanks, Louise.
- You're wasting your time.

421
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,105
- She's got good sense too.
- You're jealous.

422
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:02,007
And what does it feel like,
Mr. Carpenter?

423
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:04,307
What does what feel like,
Miss Hunt?

424
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:06,329
Living on the income
from an estate.

425
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,001
- Well, I, uh-
- Or don't you know?

426
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:11,870
Well, I did, until the sheriff
took it over 10 years ago.

427
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:13,542
Why maintain the fiction?
Why not work?

428
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,365
Believe it or not, I asked
one of my many friends for a job once...

429
00:25:16,469 --> 00:25:18,560
executive of a big company...
2,500 employees.

430
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,069
He could have pressed a button
and done it, but he just laughed.

431
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:22,742
- He thought I was joking.
- Weren't you?

432
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:25,320
No. When I convinced him, he got
embarrassed, said he'd phone me.

433
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:29,572
That was months ago. Now whenever
he sees me, he looks the other way.

434
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:38,075
- Do you really want a job?
- Yes.

435
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,117
Oh, here you are.

436
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,288
Laura, dear, I cannot stand
these morons any longer.

437
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:48,564
If you don't come with me
this instant, I shall run amok.

438
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:50,271
All right, Waldo.

439
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:52,955
10:30 tomorrow,
Bullitt and Company.

440
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:55,708
You've got a job.

441
00:25:55,812 --> 00:25:58,809
I concealed my
annoyance with masterly self-control...

442
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,026
but I sensed a situation
which would bear watching.

443
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:06,405
Laura, take a look at this.

444
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:09,368
Do you like it? Do you think it'll make
people want to bathe more often?

445
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,563
It should. It's excellent.

446
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,271
- There you are.
- Good night, Miss Hunt.

447
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,943
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Carpenter.

448
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:17,104
- Good night, honey.
- It's really very good. Who's the model?

449
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:19,578
A girl named Diane Redfern.
You hired her yourself last week.

450
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:21,250
- Don't you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

451
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:23,830
Well, let's go, moon of my delight.
I am starved.

452
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:25,885
You usually are.

453
00:26:25,955 --> 00:26:27,558
- I approve of that hat.
- You do?

454
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,893
Mm-hmm.
And the girl in it too.

455
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,635
Thank you.

456
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:35,782
I knew there was
something on my mind.

457
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:38,674
What is it? Oh, yes.
Will you dine with me tomorrow night?

458
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:40,800
- Maybe.
- No, that isn't what's worrying me.

459
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,647
- It's the next night.
- But, Shelby, I can't be...

460
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:45,260
Good. What about three weeks from
tonight and all the nights in between?

461
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,933
Don't you think
I have any other engagements?

462
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:49,686
What about two months
from now and the month after that?

463
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,439
- What about next year?
- That's all settled. What about breakfast?

464
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,018
What about dancing?

465
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:56,691
What about lunch?
Beautiful lunches...

466
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,095
- day after day after day after day?
- What about work?

467
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:01,534
Beautiful work,
day after day after day?

468
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:03,242
Why, Miss Hunt,
the way you talk.

469
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:05,019
You'd think I was
in love with you.

470
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,710
Yes, Laura,
I heard everything he said.

471
00:27:14,776 --> 00:27:16,657
I went to call for you.

472
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:19,937
I'm sorry, Waldo.

473
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:21,936
And that reminds me.

474
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,817
Old Mother Hubbard has
something in the cupboard.

475
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:31,177
The results of
my private investigation...

476
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:33,616
of that sterling character,
Mr. Shelby Carpenter.

477
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:38,017
By stooping so low, you only
degrade yourself, Waldo.

478
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:43,016
Did you know that he almost went to jail
for passing rubber checks...

479
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:45,297
that he was suspected of stealing
his hostess's jewels...

480
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:47,497
when he was a houseguest
in Virginia?

481
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:50,056
Naturally they'd suspect him,
because he isn't rich.

482
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,257
Those are only insinuations...

483
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:55,376
the cheapest kind.

484
00:27:55,496 --> 00:27:57,976
These aren't only
insinuations, my dear.

485
00:27:58,096 --> 00:27:59,977
There you are.
Read them.

486
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:03,817
What of it?

487
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:07,737
I know his faults.
A man can change, can't he?

488
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:10,417
People are always ready
to hold out a hand to slap you down...

489
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:12,337
but never to pick you up.

490
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,696
All right,
I'm helping Shelby.

491
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,817
His past is his own affair.

492
00:28:16,937 --> 00:28:19,697
I only care about the present.

493
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:22,857
Speaking of the changed Mr. Carpenter
in the present tense...

494
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:26,977
he's now running around
with a model from your own office.

495
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:29,177
Her name is Diane Redfern.

496
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:34,497
I'm closer to despising you
than I thought I ever would be.

497
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:44,497
I'm sorry. I should have
told you before.

498
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:47,057
Shelby and I are going to be
married next week.

499
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:54,377
I believe you presented him with
a cigarette case on his last birthday.

500
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,577
Rather valuable, isn't it?

501
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,617
Where did you get it?

502
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:04,897
From the pawnshop where Diane Redfern
took it after he gave it to her.

503
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:08,217
I don't believe it. He probably needed
money and was too proud to borrow.

504
00:29:08,337 --> 00:29:10,218
Carpenter proud?

505
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:13,938
Perhaps that's why
the pawn ticket was in her name.

506
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:16,017
Before this goes any further,
why, I'll just...

507
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,098
He isn't home.

508
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:29,177
He's dining
at Ann Treadwell's.

509
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:31,297
He can't be.
He asked me to dinner.

510
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:34,977
He would have canceled his appointment
with her if you had accepted.

511
00:29:35,058 --> 00:29:37,577
He treats her
rather badly these days.

512
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:41,738
I'm afraid she'll say
he isn't there.

513
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:52,618
Waldo...

514
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:55,578
why are you doing this?

515
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:02,578
For you, Laura.

516
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:07,177
Shall we pay them a visit?

517
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:10,617
He won't be there, Waldo.
I know he won't.

518
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:12,817
All right. We'll see.

519
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:18,658
Don't you want to take this little
bauble along in case he is there?

520
00:30:26,418 --> 00:30:28,218
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

521
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:31,018
- I'm sorry. Mrs. Treadwell is not home.
- We know, dear.

522
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:45,258
Good evening.

523
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:52,858
Hello, darling. I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

524
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:54,778
There you are, my dear.

525
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:57,418
In a moment of supreme disaster,
he's trite.

526
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:00,178
You've been reading
too many melodramas, Waldo.

527
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:03,259
I was just telling Ann
about our getting married.

528
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:05,179
Well, have you two
had dinner?

529
00:31:06,258 --> 00:31:08,138
Would you like
a glass of wine?

530
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:10,258
Why don't you sit down?

531
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,098
I couldn't find out
if she saw Carpenter in the meantime.

532
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:25,538
All I know is that on Friday
she had lunch with Diane Redfern.

533
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:29,859
What came of it,
I hoped to hear that night.

534
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:33,338
- I alternated between moods of
over optimism and over pessimism.

535
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,058
When the phone rang,
I had a foreboding of disaster.

536
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:42,778
I called to tell you, Waldo,
I'm frightfully sorry.

537
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:45,138
I can't have dinner
with you tonight.

538
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:48,698
Oh, no, no. I'm not sick.
I'm just dreadfully nervous.

539
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:51,259
I'm going to the country
for a few days.

540
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:53,179
Yes. I'm afraid
it's about Shelby.

541
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:56,459
Oh, no. Please.
There's nothing you can do.

542
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:58,899
I've got to think
this thing out for myself.

543
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:02,859
I'm sorry. I'll call you
when I get back. Good-bye.

544
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:07,058
It was the last time
I ever heard her voice.

545
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:11,219
I was sure she had
too much pride to forgive him.

546
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,738
But...

547
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:17,739
Where does
this Diane Redfern live?

548
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:20,139
Brooklyn somewhere.
She's in the phone book.

549
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:24,139
Come on. It's late.
Let's get going.

550
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:27,059
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

551
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,099
- All right.
- Thank you, Mr. Lydecker.

552
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,419
Good night.

553
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,899
I shall never forgive myself for
letting her become involved with Shelby.

554
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:48,459
It was my fault.

555
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,019
I should have
stopped it somehow.

556
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:53,019
Well, it's too late now.

557
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:58,699
Thanks for the wine.

558
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:17,419
Hello. Mosconi's?

559
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:20,619
This is Lieutenant McPherson,
Homicide Bureau.

560
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:24,579
Laura Hunt had been buying her liquor
from you for several years, hadn't she?

561
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,819
Yeah.

562
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:30,020
Did she ever buy a brand of scotch
called Black Pony?

563
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:33,420
Yeah.

564
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:37,020
I see.

565
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,139
Well, that's all
I wanted to know. Thanks.

566
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:41,059
She's here, McPherson...
the maid.

567
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:43,499
Okay.

568
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,219
- Come in, Miss Clary.
- Never mind the "Miss Clary" stuff.

569
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,979
My name's Bessie, and I'm a domestic,
and I got nothin' to be ashamed of.

570
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:52,019
Sit down, Bessie.

571
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:55,139
Her letters.

572
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,059
And her private diary.

573
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,099
You've been reading them,
pawing over them.

574
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,499
It's a shame in the face of the dead.
That's what it is. It's a shame.

575
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,100
- Sit down, Bessie.
- I'll stand on my own two feet.

576
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,140
Don't you go
ordering me around.

577
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,579
I ain't afraid of cops. I was
brought up to spit whenever I saw one.

578
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,340
Okay, go ahead and spit
if that'll make you feel better.

579
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:24,060
What do you want to know?

580
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,380
What we all want to know...
who killed Laura Hunt.

581
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,339
How would I know?

582
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,060
You don't think I done it?

583
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,700
I know you cops
get crazy notions...

584
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,060
but if you got any notion
concerning me...

585
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,460
Ask anyone...
anyone who ever come to this house.

586
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,380
I would have
worked for her.

587
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:44,300
I would have washed,
ironed, scrubbed...

588
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:47,939
done everything she wanted of me,
whether she paid me for it or not.

589
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,671
And it wasn't only on account of the
thousand sweet things she done for me.

590
00:34:51,786 --> 00:34:54,092
It was because she was
so sweet herself...

591
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:57,473
because she was
a real fine lady.

592
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:01,970
But you cops
wouldn't know about that.

593
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:06,927
But you do. That's all the more reason
why you should help me, Bessie.

594
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:09,771
Do you happen to know how this got into
her liquor cabinet?

595
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,076
I put it there.

596
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:16,381
But she never bought cheap stuff like
that... not a lady like Miss Hunt.

597
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:19,225
- No.
- When did you put it in the cabinet?

598
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:21,031
- Saturday.
- Before the police came.

599
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:24,336
- Was it there Friday night before you left?
- No.

600
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:26,334
Are you sure of that?

601
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,832
I cleaned out
the cabinet on Friday...

602
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,754
and put the empties
in the basement.

603
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:34,174
Then somebody was with her
in the apartment Friday night...

604
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:36,019
someone
who brought that bottle.

605
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,901
- Yes.
- Who?

606
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:40,092
I don't know,
but I didn't want anyone...

607
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:43,205
getting any wrong ideas about her,
God rest her soul.

608
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,049
That's why I took it out of the bedroom
and put it in the cabinet...

609
00:35:46,164 --> 00:35:47,932
before the police got here.

610
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:50,314
And that ain't all I done.

611
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:53,235
I washed out the glasses
and cleaned off the bottle too.

612
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,503
Do you know what happens to people
who destroy evidence?

613
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:58,231
I don't care.

614
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:00,383
You ain't gonna tell
the newspaper reporters, are ya...

615
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,343
and let them make up
their nasty stories...

616
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:04,264
and drag her name
through the mud?

617
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,647
Go ahead,
but it won't do you any good.

618
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:10,375
- I'll say you lied. I'll say...
- Take it easy, Bessie.

619
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:13,411
Get me some ice
and a setup, will you?

620
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,563
All right.

621
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,523
A couple of highball glasses.

622
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,556
Good morning.
Lieutenant McPherson sent for us.

623
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,401
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Hello, McPherson.

624
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:28,090
- This is quite a delegation. I only sent for you, Carpenter.
- I know.

625
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:30,281
Shelby's dropping me off
at the hairdresser's later...

626
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,394
- so I thought I might as well come along.
- My excuse is equally feeble.

627
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:35,431
I just popped in
to pay my dubious respects...

628
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:37,313
and inquire as to
the state of your health.

629
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,774
- Insipid, I trust.
- I was just going to pour myself a drink.

630
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:43,079
- Care to join me?
- A very nice idea. Shelby, wouldn't you like one?

631
00:36:43,155 --> 00:36:44,923
- I'll get it.
- Never mind.

632
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,998
- Bessie, would you bring a couple more glasses?
- Yes, sir.

633
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:49,112
Hi, Bessie.
What are you doing here?

634
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:51,225
I'm paid up for the week,
and I'm working, regardless.

635
00:36:51,302 --> 00:36:53,800
- Would you like one, Lydecker?
- I see no reason to exclude myself...

636
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,644
if the host provides scotch.

637
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:57,873
- This do?
- I presume it'll have to.

638
00:36:57,989 --> 00:36:59,987
How about you, Carpenter?
It's cheap, but it's potent.

639
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:03,754
As a matter of fact, I don't think I care
for any. I'm not much of a daytime drinker.

640
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:07,751
- Uh-huh. That'll be all for you, Bessie.
You can go home now. - But I... Yes, sir.

641
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,093
I remember when Laura
bought these glasses.

642
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,246
She loved them.
She loved all her things so.

643
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,551
What are you going to do?
Sell them?

644
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,318
I don't know.
I suppose so. Thank you.

645
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:22,122
If I'm appointed administrator of the estate,
I shall probably just call in Corey.

646
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,160
You mean Lancaster Corey,
the art dealer?

647
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:26,004
Yes. He was
a friend of Laura's.

648
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:29,155
Let him dispose of everything.
It'll be less gruesome that way.

649
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:32,038
Not quite everything, Ann.

650
00:37:32,153 --> 00:37:34,266
Two or three things in here
belong to me.

651
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:36,304
This vase, for instance...

652
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:39,109
and that, uh, clock,
of course...

653
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,876
and the antique fire screen.

654
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,297
- I only lent them to Laura, you know.
- Oh, really, Waldo.

655
00:37:44,412 --> 00:37:47,756
Yes, really. This vase is the gem of my
collection. I intend to have it back.

656
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:49,639
And the clock and the screen too.

657
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:52,444
But they aren't yours. You gave them
to Laura. I won't permit it.

658
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,595
Does an alleged fiance
have any voice in this matter?

659
00:37:55,711 --> 00:38:00,245
I'll take the vase with me now and send someone
to collect the other things this very day.

660
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,665
Nothing is leaving here
except you, Lydecker.

661
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,701
Is that your quaint way
of indicating dismissal?

662
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:09,545
We're all going anyway. I have to be
back at headquarters by noon.

663
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:13,196
Lieutenant, I don't understand.
You sent for me, didn't you?

664
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:15,117
- Yeah.
- Well, don't you want to see me?

665
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:17,654
- Don't you want to ask me some questions?
- I'll be seeing you.

666
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,767
- Well...
- I bid you good day.

667
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:23,303
- Come along, Shelby.
- Are you making any progress on the case, Lieutenant?

668
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,608
We're doing all right.

669
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:42,404
- Hello, Mark.
- Go get something to eat. I'll take over.

670
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:44,479
- Thanks.
- Take your time.

671
00:41:29,881 --> 00:41:31,955
Fred?

672
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,027
- Yes?
- What's the matter? Did you go to sleep?

673
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:40,718
This is McPherson.
Any calls come through?

674
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:44,138
Well, keep listening.

675
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:46,137
No. Nothing new.

676
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:53,822
I happened to see
the lights on.

677
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:56,781
Have you sublet
this apartment?

678
00:41:56,897 --> 00:41:58,664
You're here often enough
to pay rent.

679
00:41:58,741 --> 00:42:01,777
- Any objections?
- Yes.

680
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,698
I object to you prying
into Laura's letters...

681
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,543
especially those from me.

682
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:08,387
- Why? Yours are the best in the bunch.
- Thanks.

683
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:10,539
But I didn't
write them to you.

684
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,845
Haven't you any sense
of privacy?

685
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:16,841
Murder victims have
no claim to privacy.

686
00:42:16,957 --> 00:42:20,454
Have detectives who buy portraits
of murder victims a claim to privacy?

687
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:25,065
Lancaster Corey told me
that you've already put in a bid for it.

688
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,409
That's none of your business.

689
00:42:27,487 --> 00:42:31,176
McPherson, did it ever strike you
that you're acting very strangely?

690
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:34,519
It's a wonder you don't come here like a
suitor, with roses and a box of candy...

691
00:42:34,634 --> 00:42:36,441
drugstore candy, of course.

692
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,784
Have you ever dreamed
of Laura as your wife...

693
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,704
by your side at the policeman's ball,
or in the bleachers...

694
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,702
or listening to the heroic story of how
you got a silver shinbone...

695
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:47,854
from a gun battle
with a gangster?

696
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,735
- I see you have.
- Why don't you go home? I'm busy.

697
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,655
Perhaps we can
come to terms now.

698
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:59,805
You want the portrait.
Perfectly understandable.

699
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:02,995
I want my possessions...
my vase, my clock and my screen.

700
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,224
Also perfectly understandable.
Now, if you...

701
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:07,069
Get going.

702
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:11,373
You better watch out, McPherson,
or you'll end up in a psychiatric ward.

703
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,293
I don't think they've ever had a patient
who fell in love with a corpse.

704
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:40,261
What are you doing here?

705
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,104
You're alive.

706
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:47,255
If you don't get out at once,
I'm going to call the police.

707
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,561
You are Laura Hunt,
aren't you?

708
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:52,904
Aren't you?

709
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:55,402
- I'm going to call the police.
- Well, I am the police.

710
00:44:57,093 --> 00:44:59,169
Mark McPherson.

711
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:02,127
What's this all about?

712
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,280
Don't you know?

713
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:07,739
- Don't you know what's happened?
- No.

714
00:45:07,815 --> 00:45:10,374
Haven't you seen the papers?
Where have you been?

715
00:45:10,495 --> 00:45:14,494
Up in the country.
I-I don't get a newspaper.

716
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:18,454
- Haven't you got a radio?
- It was broken.

717
00:45:18,574 --> 00:45:20,414
What...

718
00:45:37,773 --> 00:45:40,332
Somebody was murdered
in this room.

719
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:42,252
Do you have any idea
who it was?

720
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,172
No.

721
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:46,692
Who had a key
to your apartment?

722
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,732
Nobody.

723
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:50,651
Are you sure?

724
00:45:51,651 --> 00:45:55,291
- When did it happen?
- Friday night.

725
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,050
What are you
going to do now?

726
00:46:00,131 --> 00:46:02,170
Find out
who was murdered...

727
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,130
and then find the murderer.

728
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,970
You'd better take off those wet clothes.
You might catch cold.

729
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:17,048
Yeah.

730
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:28,088
I found this in my closet.

731
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,047
It's Diane Redfern's.

732
00:46:30,168 --> 00:46:33,207
It wasn't here when I left.
She's one of our models.

733
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:35,447
Just about my size.

734
00:46:35,567 --> 00:46:38,327
Beautiful, wasn't she?

735
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:40,447
Do you suppose...

736
00:46:44,686 --> 00:46:46,566
Sit down, please.

737
00:46:50,525 --> 00:46:53,326
This is Monday night.
You left on Friday.

738
00:46:53,405 --> 00:46:57,005
- Rather a long weekend, isn't it?
- Yes.

739
00:46:57,085 --> 00:46:59,005
What train did you take?

740
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:00,924
The 7:26.

741
00:47:01,044 --> 00:47:04,045
- See anybody you knew on the train?
- No.

742
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:08,164
- Then what?
- Then I got off the train at Norwalk.

743
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,564
- Saw nobody you knew at the station either?
- No.

744
00:47:11,684 --> 00:47:15,723
- Go on.
- Then I went to the garage where I keep my car.

745
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:19,563
It's a private garage.
Nobody saw me there either.

746
00:47:19,643 --> 00:47:21,523
Then I drove to my house.

747
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:24,282
You were there three days.
What did you do?

748
00:47:24,402 --> 00:47:26,922
Work in my garden.

749
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:28,882
You didn't go out
in all that time?

750
00:47:29,002 --> 00:47:32,562
No. I had everything
I needed in the house.

751
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:34,801
- Nobody came to see you?
- Nobody.

752
00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:36,721
I went there to be alone.

753
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:40,001
Police were there on Saturday.
There was no one in the house.

754
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:44,520
Oh, yes. Saturday,
I took a long walk.

755
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:46,600
I walked for hours
in the woods.

756
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Mm-hmm. You were going to
marry Shelby Carpenter this week.

757
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,439
Thursday, if I'm not mistaken.

758
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,720
Yes.

759
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,639
Yet you went away
just before your wedding...

760
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:02,719
for a long weekend
to be alone.

761
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:05,199
I was tired.
I'd been working hard.

762
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:08,359
You know Shelby Carpenter has a key to
this apartment. Why didn't you tell me?

763
00:48:08,438 --> 00:48:10,718
I know nothing of the sort.
He hasn't.

764
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:12,718
How else did the girl
get into the apartment?

765
00:48:12,798 --> 00:48:15,718
You knew she was in love with Carpenter,
that he'd given her your cigarette case.

766
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:17,717
You know all that,
don't you?

767
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:20,477
I knew that she was in love with him.
She told me so herself.

768
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,597
- When did she tell you?
- At lunch last Friday.

769
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:27,277
I also know she meant nothing to Shelby.
I understand him better than you do.

770
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:29,556
She was found in your
dressing gown and slippers.

771
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:31,996
That's hardly the regulation costume
for an impersonal chat...

772
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:34,796
between a man and woman
who mean nothing to each other.

773
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:37,556
Did you know or did you suspect he was
going to bring her here Friday night?

774
00:48:37,676 --> 00:48:40,355
How could I? I don't know that he
brought her here. Neither do you.

775
00:48:40,436 --> 00:48:42,796
- You merely assume it.
- What other assumption is possible?

776
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:46,195
Do you love Carpenter so much you'd risk
your own safety to protect him?

777
00:48:46,275 --> 00:48:48,955
My own safety?
Do you suspect me?

778
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:52,154
I suspect nobody and everybody.
I'm merely trying to get at the truth.

779
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:54,354
I see you have been trying
to get at the truth.

780
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:57,074
You've read things I never meant
anyone else to look at.

781
00:48:57,194 --> 00:48:59,074
Strictly routine.

782
00:48:59,154 --> 00:49:01,034
I'm sorry. Really.

783
00:49:03,713 --> 00:49:06,513
I'd better be going. I'll see you
in the morning, Miss Hunt.

784
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:10,473
Oh, I must ask you not to leave
the house or use the phone.

785
00:49:10,593 --> 00:49:13,872
But... But I've got
to let my friends know I'm alive.

786
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,312
Sorry, Miss Hunt,
but I must insist you do as I say.

787
00:49:16,432 --> 00:49:19,272
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

788
00:49:19,352 --> 00:49:22,751
But if anything should happen
to you this time, I wouldn't like it.

789
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:25,712
All right.
I promise.

790
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,551
There's one more thing.
You may as well know what I know...

791
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:30,511
some of it, at any rate.

792
00:49:30,631 --> 00:49:33,870
It'll save time and a lot
of unnecessary fencing.

793
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,551
I know that you went away
to make up your mind...

794
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,830
whether you'd marry
Shelby Carpenter or... or not.

795
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,629
What did you decide?
I want the truth.

796
00:49:48,709 --> 00:49:50,589
I decided
not to marry him.

797
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:54,428
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.

798
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:56,429
Good night.

799
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:13,027
Really?
Does McPherson know that?

800
00:50:13,147 --> 00:50:15,747
Uh-huh. Well, okay.
Good-bye.

801
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,506
Say, Mark, that was
the medical examiner's report.

802
00:50:19,627 --> 00:50:22,787
It wasn't Laura Hunt. It was Diane
Redfern that was bumped off upstairs.

803
00:50:22,866 --> 00:50:25,346
- Kinda balls things up, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

804
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:27,666
Say, you're not taking it too hard.

805
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:30,026
Wait a minute.

806
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:32,465
- Hello?
- This is Laura. I've...

807
00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:34,465
Don't say anything on the phone.
Meet me right away.

808
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:37,464
I'll wait for you in my car
in front of Bullitt's.

809
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:39,505
- Was that...
- Yeah.

810
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,825
Dames are always
pulling a switch on you.

811
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:43,744
Stand by.

812
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:02,302
You follow her.
I'm gonna tail him.

813
00:51:52,578 --> 00:51:54,697
Are you taking it down
or putting it away, Carpenter?

814
00:52:07,176 --> 00:52:10,456
- It's been fired lately.
- Yes. I killed some rabbits with it.

815
00:52:10,536 --> 00:52:13,136
- When?
- Oh, a while back. I don't know exactly.

816
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:15,096
You know about guns,
don't you?

817
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,856
- Yes.
- How come you didn't clean it afterward?

818
00:52:17,976 --> 00:52:20,535
I don't know.
I forgot, I suppose.

819
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:24,095
- Your initials?
- Yes. I gave it to Laura for protection.

820
00:52:24,215 --> 00:52:26,374
She didn't want it,
but I insisted.

821
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,055
This house is rather isolated,
as you see.

822
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:31,494
- Did you teach her how to use it?
- No.

823
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:35,014
- Does she know how?
- I don't know. It didn't occur to me to ask.

824
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:37,174
You're a vague sort of a fellow,
aren't you, Carpenter?

825
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,653
I've spent very little time in observing
my own character, Mr. McPherson.

826
00:52:40,773 --> 00:52:43,293
You haven't borrowed it lately?
You didn't just bring it back tonight?

827
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:47,293
You followed me here.
You saw me come in. You ought to know.

828
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:50,932
You, uh, realize
the spot you're in, Carpenter?

829
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:52,892
You took that poor girl
to Miss Hunt's apartment.

830
00:52:53,012 --> 00:52:55,412
You knew all along
it was she who was murdered.

831
00:52:57,172 --> 00:53:00,372
Didn't you know Laura Hunt would come
back any day and spill the whole thing?

832
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,891
Or did you plan
to kill her too...

833
00:53:04,011 --> 00:53:06,851
hide the body someplace
and cover up your first crime?

834
00:53:06,971 --> 00:53:10,250
You're being fantastic,
McPherson.

835
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:12,890
You took a bottle of Black Pony
to her house Friday night.

836
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:14,970
I took it there
over a week ago.

837
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,490
Bessie said it wasn't there Friday
night. It was Saturday morning.

838
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,930
I can't help what Bessie said.

839
00:53:22,889 --> 00:53:25,689
- Where's the key to her apartment?
- I haven't got it.

840
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:30,449
- What did you do with it, give it back to her tonight?
- I never had one.

841
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:32,888
You didn't take the bottle
of scotch to her house Friday night.

842
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,248
You haven't got a key to her apartment.
How did you get in?

843
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:37,249
- Well, I...
- You had a key, and I know it.

844
00:53:37,368 --> 00:53:39,648
- Now, come on, Carpenter. Spill it.
- I...

845
00:53:39,768 --> 00:53:43,968
Laura kept a duplicate key
at her office. I went over and got it.

846
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:48,007
I'd asked Diane to dine with me. I wanted
to have it out with her once and for all.

847
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:52,447
You know, she thought... Well,
she thought she was in love with me.

848
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:55,646
Well, we couldn't go on talking
in public places. She was too upset.

849
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:58,006
I couldn't go to her room, and I didn't
want to take her to my hotel.

850
00:53:58,126 --> 00:54:00,686
- So we went to Laura's.
- Yeah?

851
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:02,645
We talked there
for about three hours...

852
00:54:02,766 --> 00:54:06,085
- and then the doorbell rang and...
- Go on.

853
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,766
Diane was frightened.
But knowing Laura as I've known her...

854
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,726
I've learned to be
surprised at nothing.

855
00:54:10,805 --> 00:54:13,965
- What do you mean by that?
- Her friends would come to her with their troubles...

856
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:16,205
at all hours
of the day or night.

857
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:18,604
I asked Diane
to answer the door.

858
00:54:18,685 --> 00:54:22,324
- Why didn't you go yourself?
- Supposing one of Laura's friends had found me there.

859
00:54:22,444 --> 00:54:25,124
- Why open the door at all?
- They must have seen the light.

860
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:27,844
What about the girl? Diane...
what about her reputation?

861
00:54:27,923 --> 00:54:31,603
I asked her to tell them Laura had let
her the apartment while she was away.

862
00:54:31,723 --> 00:54:33,803
Anybody that knew Laura
would have believed that.

863
00:54:33,923 --> 00:54:37,123
- Yeah. Go on.
- Well, then the doorbell rang again.

864
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:39,883
I could hear Diane's mules...
Laura's they were...

865
00:54:39,962 --> 00:54:42,803
clattering across the bare boards
between the rugs.

866
00:54:42,922 --> 00:54:45,282
Then there was a moment's silence
and then a shot.

867
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:49,041
It was an awful explosion.

868
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:52,002
By the time I reached her,
the door was closed.

869
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,561
- She lay there on the floor.
- Did you go out to see who it was?

870
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:58,200
No. I was too confused, too horrified,
incapable of doing anything.

871
00:54:58,321 --> 00:55:01,161
The room was dark. I saw only
a vague heap lying on the floor.

872
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,400
I... I don't think
I fully grasped the situation.

873
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,479
I think I called her name,
but I'm not sure. I...

874
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,519
I remember kneeling on the floor,
feeling her heart.

875
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:15,040
My first instinct
was to call the police.

876
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,999
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

877
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,159
Or rather, I was afraid...
not only for myself, but for Laura.

878
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:24,438
In a panicky sort of way, I felt I must
keep out of this to keep Laura out of it.

879
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:26,598
I know now how foolish
and hopeless it was...

880
00:55:26,678 --> 00:55:29,118
but there was only
one thing on my mind...

881
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:31,758
the safety of a person whose life
was dearer to me than my own.

882
00:55:31,878 --> 00:55:33,757
Don't you understand that?

883
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:36,038
Did you think
Laura had done it?

884
00:55:36,117 --> 00:55:38,918
- Did you?
- I don't remember what I thought.

885
00:55:39,037 --> 00:55:41,917
- Do you think so now?
- No.

886
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:44,083
- But you didn't?
- No.

887
00:55:44,203 --> 00:55:47,372
On Saturday, when our men went to the
hotel to tell you that Laura was dead...

888
00:55:47,452 --> 00:55:51,224
- you seemed sincerely shocked.
- I was. I hadn't expected that mistake.

889
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:53,270
But you had your alibi ready
no matter who was dead.

890
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:56,078
Yet you knew the minute
Laura got back it wouldn't stick.

891
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:58,725
Don't you see? I was incapable
of thinking that far ahead.

892
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:01,213
I was incapable
of thinking at all.

893
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:04,624
I was groping for some way
to keep Laura's name out of it.

894
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:09,037
I was heartbroken about Diane
and panic-stricken about Laura.

895
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,523
I haven't slept a full two hours
since this thing happened.

896
00:56:11,644 --> 00:56:14,613
Let's get back to the present. What did
you and Laura talk about tonight?

897
00:56:14,692 --> 00:56:17,300
I told her the whole story,
just as I've told you.

898
00:56:19,066 --> 00:56:21,192
She phoned you after she promised me
she wouldn't call anybody.

899
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:24,161
- What did she want?
- It's perfectly natural she should want to see me...

900
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,087
especially
after what's happened.

901
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:28,935
Why don't you tell the truth? She sent
you here to get rid of this gun.

902
00:56:29,015 --> 00:56:32,184
She did not. It was my own idea.
She doesn't even know I'm here.

903
00:56:38,643 --> 00:56:42,695
- It works fine, doesn't it?
- Yes. Did you think it wouldn't?

904
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:45,222
I hoped it wouldn't.
All right. Let's go.

905
00:56:46,627 --> 00:56:50,438
- Well, am I under arrest?
- No, but you're not to leave town...

906
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,925
and it would be
foolish of you to try it.

907
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,566
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

908
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:16,420
- What's that?
- Breakfast.

909
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,867
You didn't buy any food
when you went out last night.

910
00:57:24,604 --> 00:57:28,215
I'll fix some bacon and eggs.
Can you make coffee?

911
00:57:28,335 --> 00:57:31,946
Suppose you set the table
while I get breakfast.

912
00:57:32,026 --> 00:57:33,951
Do you always sound like this
in the morning?

913
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:35,917
Don't tell me
you can cook.

914
00:57:36,038 --> 00:57:40,009
My mother always listened sympathetically
to my dreams of a career...

915
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,497
and then taught me
another recipe.

916
00:57:42,617 --> 00:57:45,104
Shh! Don't move.

917
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,125
It's all right, Bessie.
It's all right, Bessie.

918
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:55,535
She's alive.

919
00:57:55,656 --> 00:57:57,541
It's all been
a mistake, Bessie.

920
00:57:57,621 --> 00:58:00,389
I'm not a ghost. Really.

921
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:03,237
I found you,
and you were dead.

922
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,324
It was Miss Redfern's
body you found.

923
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,537
How about
taking over here...

924
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:11,943
fixing us some
coffee and eggs.

925
00:58:12,024 --> 00:58:16,156
But I... I saw it
with my own eyes.

926
00:58:16,236 --> 00:58:18,523
I... I don't
understand it.

927
00:58:18,603 --> 00:58:21,331
Have you ever
heard a ghost ask for eggs?

928
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:23,337
No, miss.

929
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:25,343
You'll be all right,
Bessie.

930
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:38,141
Somebody should have warned her.
Poor Bessie.

931
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:41,229
By the way, I've asked Waldo Lydecker
to come here this morning.

932
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,556
- Did you tell him?
- No.

933
00:58:43,637 --> 00:58:45,563
Why not?
It's brutal.

934
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:48,893
I'm not doing it for fun.

935
00:58:49,013 --> 00:58:52,262
Why did you break your promise
and go out and see Shelby last night?

936
00:58:52,382 --> 00:58:54,428
You forced me
to give you my word.

937
00:58:54,548 --> 00:58:56,715
I never have been and I
never will be bound by anything...

938
00:58:56,795 --> 00:58:59,082
I don't do
of my own free will.

939
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,810
Redfern was in love
with Carpenter.

940
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:03,816
You admitted that
last night.

941
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:06,625
- May I have a match, please?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

942
00:59:06,745 --> 00:59:10,114
I also told you that
he wasn't in love with her.

943
00:59:10,235 --> 00:59:12,602
Just sit still.

944
00:59:19,783 --> 00:59:22,470
Hello, Lieutenant.

945
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:25,118
- Morning, my darling.
- Hello, dear.

946
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,726
Ah. Thank you.

947
00:59:27,846 --> 00:59:29,893
Oh. It's on again.

948
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:33,543
Do I have to get a permit from the police
department to kiss my fiancee good morning?

949
00:59:33,664 --> 00:59:35,549
So he made you
change your mind.

950
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:37,836
Speaking of changing one's mind,
Mr. McPherson...

951
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:40,002
I have just come
from my lawyer.

952
00:59:40,082 --> 00:59:42,650
Yeah? Did he tell you how much
you'll get off for good behavior?

953
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,817
No, but he told me that anything
I may have said last night...

954
00:59:44,896 --> 00:59:47,785
was said under duress
and can't be used against me.

955
00:59:47,866 --> 00:59:49,751
Besides, none of it was true.

956
00:59:49,871 --> 00:59:53,402
Smart lawyer you've got. Maybe he told you
how that scotch got up here Friday night...

957
00:59:53,522 --> 00:59:55,408
after you'd bought it
at Mosconi's.

958
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:57,494
Maybe it was the lawyer
who brought Diane Redfern up here.

959
00:59:57,574 --> 00:59:59,500
Maybe...

960
01:00:03,873 --> 01:00:06,440
Well, McPherson...

961
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,248
have you thought over
the deal I suggested?

962
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:15,186
Waldo.

963
01:00:15,306 --> 01:00:17,192
Waldo.

964
01:00:20,642 --> 01:00:22,688
Right-hand pocket.

965
01:00:22,768 --> 01:00:24,775
You want a doctor?

966
01:00:24,895 --> 01:00:27,261
Right-hand pocket.

967
01:00:27,382 --> 01:00:29,748
We'd better take him
into the bedroom.

968
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:43,148
- What...
- Don't try and say anything, dear.

969
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:45,194
Just be quiet.

970
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,527
I think this is
carrying things too far.

971
01:00:49,648 --> 01:00:51,893
Your methods are vicious.
There ought to be a law against it.

972
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,381
- Yeah?
- How does he feel now?

973
01:00:54,501 --> 01:00:56,387
It was a terrible shock.
Poor darling.

974
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:58,393
Don't tell me you're in love
with him too.

975
01:00:58,474 --> 01:01:00,559
Look here, fella. You're not to talk
that way to Miss Hunt.

976
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,606
Shut up. Why do you cover up
for a guy like him?

977
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:05,213
- Don't answer him, Laura.
- What story did he tell you last night?

978
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:07,861
- Don't answer him. Let him talk to our lawyer.
- Our lawyer?

979
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:09,827
- So now you're covering up for each other.
- Look at him, Laura.

980
01:01:09,947 --> 01:01:12,554
He's beginning to crack up.
He'd use anything to make an arrest...

981
01:01:12,675 --> 01:01:14,561
just so he can be a big shot
in the headlines.

982
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:16,607
I've got enough on you
to arrest you right now.

983
01:01:16,687 --> 01:01:18,612
Quick, McPherson,
the handcuffs.

984
01:01:18,693 --> 01:01:21,020
- Trundle him off to the hoosegow.
- You keep out of this.

985
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,269
- You'll look nice in bracelets.
- Why don't you get down on all fours again, Waldo?

986
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,957
It's the only time you've ever
kept your mouth shut.

987
01:01:27,037 --> 01:01:29,885
I hope you'll forgive
my wee touch of epilepsy, my dear.

988
01:01:30,006 --> 01:01:32,052
It's an old family custom.

989
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:35,221
Well, McPherson, what does
Laura's resurrection do to you?

990
01:01:35,342 --> 01:01:38,190
Too bad Diane Redfern
can't be resurrected.

991
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:40,597
I'm afraid I've interrupted
what you call "a pinch."

992
01:01:40,678 --> 01:01:43,566
Do your duty, McPherson.

993
01:01:43,646 --> 01:01:46,856
You know, Lydecker,
you've made me change my mind.

994
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:48,822
- For the moment.
- Well, in that case...

995
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:50,868
we'll have time
for a little get-together.

996
01:01:50,988 --> 01:01:54,839
- You'd better order some liquor and some food, Laura.
- What for?

997
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:56,845
People are coming
to celebrate your return.

998
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:58,931
Ann and Bullitt and Corey.
Everybody.

999
01:01:59,051 --> 01:02:02,100
- Who asked them to come?
- I did, when I was in there.

1000
01:02:02,221 --> 01:02:04,107
I phoned my man,
and he's calling everyone.

1001
01:02:04,227 --> 01:02:07,958
- Why did you do that, Waldo?
- A sense of the fitness of things, my dear.

1002
01:02:08,078 --> 01:02:11,688
Perhaps our friend can weave all the
loose ends into a noose. Eh, McPherson?

1003
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,136
Sorry you went to all that trouble.
I've already called them.

1004
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:20,514
You're working yourself
to death, darling.

1005
01:02:20,595 --> 01:02:23,804
- I haven't had a moment with you all day.
- It's a very thirsty crowd.

1006
01:02:23,924 --> 01:02:26,252
Oh, after all,
it isn't your homecoming.

1007
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:28,738
Aren't you being
a little bit nasty, Ann?

1008
01:02:28,819 --> 01:02:30,704
I feel nasty
when I don't see you.

1009
01:02:30,825 --> 01:02:34,275
Well, you look very sweet. That's
a completely wonderful hat, darling.

1010
01:02:34,356 --> 01:02:37,244
Now, if you'll forgive me,
Laura wants a cocktail.

1011
01:02:37,364 --> 01:02:39,651
- So do I.
- Well, here you go.

1012
01:02:40,774 --> 01:02:43,141
Shelby, why don't you
come to your senses?

1013
01:02:43,221 --> 01:02:46,631
You know it's all over between you
and Laura, or it soon will be.

1014
01:02:46,712 --> 01:02:49,921
But you haven't lost me.
Why don't we get married now?

1015
01:02:50,042 --> 01:02:52,649
- Ann, dear, you don't seem to realize the situation.
- Yes, but I do.

1016
01:02:52,729 --> 01:02:55,978
That's why you need me. We'll get
the best lawyer that money can buy.

1017
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:59,549
When it's all over, we'll go away... anywhere
you want... and forget about all this.

1018
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,919
Thanks, Ann, but you see,
Laura needs me. Sorry.

1019
01:03:05,487 --> 01:03:07,412
Uh-uh.

1020
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:11,745
- Laura.
- Thanks.

1021
01:03:11,825 --> 01:03:14,473
If you don't mind,
I'd like a word with Miss Hunt.

1022
01:03:14,553 --> 01:03:17,001
I don't mind.
Talk to her as much as you like.

1023
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:21,494
- I see he's taking a new tack.
- What do you mean?

1024
01:03:21,574 --> 01:03:25,265
Trying to make you like him
to make you talk.

1025
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:28,314
Shelby, tell me,
why did you go to...

1026
01:03:29,879 --> 01:03:31,764
Excuse me.

1027
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:35,415
Why did you go
to the cottage last night?

1028
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:37,421
But don't you know?
I was afraid...

1029
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:40,148
you wouldn't think
of hiding that shotgun.

1030
01:03:40,229 --> 01:03:43,800
- What shotgun?
- The one I gave you.

1031
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,126
You don't have to lie
to me, darling.

1032
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:48,132
I'll stand by you.

1033
01:03:54,992 --> 01:03:57,199
What's the matter,
Laura?

1034
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,488
Oh, I guess I'm just nervous.
That's all.

1035
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:03,217
So am I.

1036
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,503
McPherson suspects Shelby.

1037
01:04:06,627 --> 01:04:08,512
He seems to suspect me too.

1038
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,481
And so do
some of my friends.

1039
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:13,527
You?
Don't be absurd.

1040
01:04:13,647 --> 01:04:16,174
- You could never do a thing like that.
- And Shelby?

1041
01:04:16,255 --> 01:04:18,181
Oh, I don't think
he did it.

1042
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,147
But he's capable of it.

1043
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:24,439
Are you as interested in McPherson
as he is in you?

1044
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,606
But, Ann, I only
met him last night.

1045
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:28,892
That's more than
long enough sometimes.

1046
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:33,425
Anyway, he's better for you
than Shelby. Anybody is.

1047
01:04:33,546 --> 01:04:36,796
- Shelby's better for me.
- Why?

1048
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:39,764
Because I can afford him,
and I understand him.

1049
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:43,656
He's no good,
but he's what I want.

1050
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:46,584
I'm not a nice person,
Laura. Neither is he.

1051
01:04:46,665 --> 01:04:50,074
He knows I know he's...
just what he is.

1052
01:04:50,195 --> 01:04:53,124
He also knows
that I don't care.

1053
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:57,537
We belong together because we're
both weak and can't seem to help it.

1054
01:04:57,657 --> 01:05:00,425
That's why I know
he's capable of murder.

1055
01:05:00,545 --> 01:05:02,431
He's like me.

1056
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,162
No, dear, I didn't...

1057
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:09,050
but I thought of it.

1058
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,471
Hello? Yes. Yes.

1059
01:05:29,591 --> 01:05:31,997
Oh, it's for you, Lieutenant.

1060
01:05:32,118 --> 01:05:34,405
Thank you, Bessie.

1061
01:05:34,485 --> 01:05:36,371
McPherson.

1062
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:39,981
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry.

1063
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:42,067
I told you I'd bring in
the killer today.

1064
01:05:43,752 --> 01:05:45,959
Yeah. I was just gonna
make the arrest when you called.

1065
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,489
No, I can't tell you now.
I'm not alone.

1066
01:05:51,856 --> 01:05:53,702
You'll see when I come in.

1067
01:05:53,822 --> 01:05:55,708
Right. See you later.

1068
01:06:14,884 --> 01:06:16,770
All right. Let's go.

1069
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,294
- You mean...
- Yeah.

1070
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,300
Oh, no!

1071
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,312
No. No, no.

1072
01:06:24,432 --> 01:06:26,357
Not Miss Hunt.

1073
01:06:26,478 --> 01:06:28,364
Please!

1074
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:31,286
Thank you, Bessie.

1075
01:06:32,286 --> 01:06:34,166
Thank you.

1076
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:38,926
Now will you please be good enough
to go and get me my things?

1077
01:06:39,045 --> 01:06:41,245
- Yes, miss.
- Laura.

1078
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:45,245
Don't worry, darling.
Let them accuse you.

1079
01:06:45,324 --> 01:06:47,204
We'll fight them.

1080
01:06:47,323 --> 01:06:50,683
I have every weapon...
money, connections, prestige.

1081
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:55,923
And my column. Every day, millions will
read about you and rally to your defense.

1082
01:06:56,002 --> 01:06:58,602
You talk as if you wanted
to see her tried for murder.

1083
01:06:58,722 --> 01:07:03,921
Yes. Rather than let you blacken
her name with suspicions and rumors.

1084
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:09,000
Try to prove her guilty. Get on the witness
stand with your poor shreds of evidence.

1085
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:13,200
I'll expose your cheap methods
you used on her.

1086
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,119
- Thank you, Bessie.
- Laura, I told you to watch out for this fella.

1087
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,279
- Can we go now?
- I warned you.

1088
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:23,678
It's too bad you didn't
open that door Friday night, Carpenter.

1089
01:07:23,758 --> 01:07:26,557
- Wait a minute.
- Shelby!

1090
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:31,037
Oh, did he hurt you, darling?

1091
01:07:31,117 --> 01:07:32,996
Darling.

1092
01:07:34,197 --> 01:07:36,076
Ann.

1093
01:07:40,075 --> 01:07:42,555
Come in.

1094
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:44,554
Sit down.

1095
01:07:45,634 --> 01:07:47,513
- That'll be all, Gallagher.
- Yes, sir.

1096
01:07:50,953 --> 01:07:54,873
All right. Let's have it.
Look at me.

1097
01:07:57,192 --> 01:07:59,512
What are you trying to do,
force a confession out of me?

1098
01:07:59,592 --> 01:08:01,992
You've been holding out,
and I want to know why.

1099
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:03,991
It'll be easier for you
if you tell the truth.

1100
01:08:05,431 --> 01:08:07,751
What difference
does it make what I say?

1101
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,910
You've made up your mind
I'm guilty.

1102
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:13,630
- Are you?
- Don't tell me you have any doubts.

1103
01:08:13,749 --> 01:08:16,269
Since you...
Oh, I can't.

1104
01:08:16,349 --> 01:08:18,389
Please. Do I have to have
those lights in my face?

1105
01:08:24,508 --> 01:08:28,427
Thanks. No, I didn't
kill Diane Redfern...

1106
01:08:28,508 --> 01:08:30,387
or anyone else.

1107
01:08:31,826 --> 01:08:34,186
Then why...

1108
01:08:34,267 --> 01:08:37,346
Why did you tell me the radio
at your country place was broken?

1109
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:39,545
- Because it was broken.
- Not when I tried it.

1110
01:08:39,665 --> 01:08:42,545
Just as I was leaving the village,
I asked the local handyman to fix it.

1111
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:46,424
- How did he get in?
- I always leave a key under the flowerpot on the porch.

1112
01:08:46,544 --> 01:08:51,224
You're too intelligent to make up
something I could check so easily...

1113
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:56,063
but you're intelligent enough to have
broken it yourself to strengthen your story.

1114
01:08:56,143 --> 01:08:59,742
The main thing I want to know is why you
pulled that switch on me about Carpenter.

1115
01:08:59,822 --> 01:09:03,182
You told me last night
you decided not to marry him.

1116
01:09:03,302 --> 01:09:07,460
- Yes, I guess I did.
- But today it was on again. Why?

1117
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:11,620
Well, I...
I changed my mind.

1118
01:09:11,701 --> 01:09:15,979
What are you trying to hide? Don't you
realize you're involved in a murder?

1119
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,819
You've got yourself in a jam it's not
going to be easy to get out of...

1120
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:20,859
unless you're on the level
with me.

1121
01:09:20,938 --> 01:09:23,338
This is no time for secrets.

1122
01:09:23,418 --> 01:09:25,418
Now, did you really decide
to call it off...

1123
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:28,937
or did you just tell me that because
you knew I wanted to hear it?

1124
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:36,136
What went on between you and Carpenter
when you saw him last night?

1125
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:38,576
Did he persuade you to make up?

1126
01:09:39,855 --> 01:09:41,975
Or did you agree
to pretend you had?

1127
01:09:42,055 --> 01:09:45,375
- Was that it?
- Well, we... That is, both of us thought...

1128
01:09:45,454 --> 01:09:47,895
He convinced you that if you
broke the engagement now...

1129
01:09:47,974 --> 01:09:50,654
people would think
you believed he was guilty.

1130
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:54,053
Yes, but now I know it was only
because he thought I was.

1131
01:09:54,173 --> 01:09:57,013
- Did you believe he was guilty?
- No. I'm sure he isn't.

1132
01:09:57,093 --> 01:09:59,932
But he'd gotten himself
into an awfully suspicious position...

1133
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:03,332
and he's the sort of man that people are
always ready to believe the worst about.

1134
01:10:04,772 --> 01:10:06,691
Are you in love with him?

1135
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,890
I don't see how
I ever could have been.

1136
01:10:17,329 --> 01:10:19,209
Come on.
You're going home.

1137
01:10:21,569 --> 01:10:24,768
- But I thought I was...
- That's... That's what I wanted you to think.

1138
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:27,967
You and a few others.
I didn't even book you.

1139
01:10:28,048 --> 01:10:30,167
You mean this was
some sort of a game?

1140
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:32,927
I was 99% certain
about you...

1141
01:10:33,046 --> 01:10:35,286
but I had to get rid of
that one percent doubt.

1142
01:10:35,366 --> 01:10:38,326
Wasn't there
an easier way to make sure?

1143
01:10:38,406 --> 01:10:41,685
I'd... reached a point
where I needed official surroundings.

1144
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:46,084
Then it was worth it, Mark.

1145
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,924
I'll call a cab for you.

1146
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,762
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1147
01:11:05,881 --> 01:11:07,761
Good night, Mark.

1148
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:10,841
I'm going over
to Lydecker's apartment.

1149
01:12:30,627 --> 01:12:32,547
It still doesn't
make sense to me, Laura.

1150
01:12:32,627 --> 01:12:35,187
He's playing some sort
of a game with you.

1151
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:37,866
- I don't think so.
- I don't deny that he's infatuated with you...

1152
01:12:37,947 --> 01:12:41,145
in some warped way
of his own.

1153
01:12:41,226 --> 01:12:45,025
But he isn't capable of any normal,
warm human relationship.

1154
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:47,584
He's been dealing
with criminals too long.

1155
01:12:50,025 --> 01:12:52,224
When you were unattainable...
when he thought you were dead...

1156
01:12:52,304 --> 01:12:54,183
that's when
he wanted you most.

1157
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,184
But he was glad
when I came back...

1158
01:12:56,263 --> 01:12:58,183
as if he were
waiting for me.

1159
01:12:58,263 --> 01:13:01,422
Do you know what
he calls women? "Dames."

1160
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,742
A "dame" in Washington Heights
got a fox fur out of him.

1161
01:13:04,822 --> 01:13:08,221
- His very words.
- That doesn't mean anything.

1162
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,341
He isn't like that.

1163
01:13:10,461 --> 01:13:13,260
Laura, you have
one tragic weakness.

1164
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,300
With you, a lean, strong body
is the measure of a man...

1165
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:18,299
and you always get hurt.

1166
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:22,299
No man is ever
going to hurt me again.

1167
01:13:22,419 --> 01:13:25,219
No one, not even you.

1168
01:13:25,298 --> 01:13:28,578
I? Hurt you?

1169
01:13:28,658 --> 01:13:30,657
Laura, look at me.

1170
01:13:32,897 --> 01:13:35,977
When a man has everything
in the world that he wants...

1171
01:13:36,097 --> 01:13:39,096
except what he wants most...

1172
01:13:39,176 --> 01:13:41,456
he loses his self-respect.

1173
01:13:41,536 --> 01:13:44,375
It makes him bitter, Laura.

1174
01:13:44,456 --> 01:13:46,895
He wants to hurt someone
as he's been hurt.

1175
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:52,374
You were a long time
in finding out about Shelby...

1176
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:56,374
but... that's over now.

1177
01:13:56,453 --> 01:13:59,973
We'll be back together again.

1178
01:14:00,093 --> 01:14:03,292
Haven't you heard of science's
newest triumph... the doorbell?

1179
01:14:04,932 --> 01:14:06,812
I don't like to remind her.

1180
01:14:08,572 --> 01:14:13,131
- That was the murderer's signal.
- Did you eavesdrop too? I hope.

1181
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:17,090
I thought you'd like to know. We
tested your shotgun. It isn't the one.

1182
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:19,450
Now, that's what I call
a typical move...

1183
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:22,409
a real key
to the man's character.

1184
01:14:22,489 --> 01:14:24,688
First he tells you that
he thinks you're innocent...

1185
01:14:24,769 --> 01:14:26,768
then proceeds
to check up on you.

1186
01:14:26,888 --> 01:14:28,848
When I report that I think
she's innocent...

1187
01:14:28,928 --> 01:14:31,048
that's my own personal opinion.

1188
01:14:31,127 --> 01:14:33,647
When I submit proof, it becomes
the opinion of the department.

1189
01:14:33,767 --> 01:14:35,927
This entire maneuver could be a trick
to get you off your guard.

1190
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:38,087
It could be, but it isn't.

1191
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:41,726
- I believe you, Mark.
- It's the same obvious pattern, Laura.

1192
01:14:41,846 --> 01:14:45,366
If McPherson weren't muscular and
handsome in a cheap sort of way...

1193
01:14:45,486 --> 01:14:47,365
you'd see through him
in a second.

1194
01:14:47,445 --> 01:14:50,764
Waldo, I mean to be
as kind about this as I know how...

1195
01:14:50,884 --> 01:14:55,084
but I must tell you-you're the one who
follows the same obvious pattern.

1196
01:14:55,164 --> 01:14:57,404
First it was Jacoby, then Shelby.
And now I suppose...

1197
01:14:57,523 --> 01:15:00,003
- Laura, I...
- I don't think we should see each other again.

1198
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:03,883
- You're not yourself, darling.
- Yes, I am.

1199
01:15:04,003 --> 01:15:07,282
For the first time in ages,
I know what I'm doing.

1200
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:11,681
Very well.

1201
01:15:11,761 --> 01:15:14,281
I hope you'll never regret
what promises to be...

1202
01:15:14,361 --> 01:15:17,041
a disgustingly
earthy relationship.

1203
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,400
My congratulations, McPherson.

1204
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,519
Listen to my broadcast
in 15 minutes.

1205
01:15:24,599 --> 01:15:27,279
I'm discussing
great lovers of history.

1206
01:15:46,155 --> 01:15:51,275
- It was the most difficult thing
I ever had to do in my life.

1207
01:15:51,354 --> 01:15:53,674
All I need is the gun.

1208
01:15:57,874 --> 01:16:01,713
- What are you doing?
- Do you know the combination to this thing?

1209
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:05,313
- I never knew it had one.
- It must be somewhere. Oh.

1210
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:20,670
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.

1211
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:23,432
Waldo gave you that clock,
didn't he?

1212
01:16:23,552 --> 01:16:25,434
Yes.

1213
01:16:26,755 --> 01:16:28,757
The doorbell rang...

1214
01:16:28,877 --> 01:16:31,559
and Diane Redfern
went to the door in your negligee.

1215
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,403
She opened the door.
The room was dark.

1216
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:40,687
Waldo saw a girl standing there,
and he assumed it was you.

1217
01:16:41,967 --> 01:16:43,850
He figured that if
he couldn't have you himself...

1218
01:16:43,929 --> 01:16:45,851
he was gonna make sure
that nobody else did.

1219
01:16:45,932 --> 01:16:47,853
So he let her have it...

1220
01:16:51,296 --> 01:16:53,218
with both barrels,
right in the face.

1221
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:58,142
She fell here.

1222
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:01,024
Waldo heard Shelby running
from the next room...

1223
01:17:01,104 --> 01:17:03,386
so he hid
in the stairway outside.

1224
01:17:05,148 --> 01:17:07,910
Shelby was scared,
so he ran out as fast as he could.

1225
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:11,153
Then Waldo came back
and placed the gun in that clock.

1226
01:17:13,355 --> 01:17:15,236
I knew it.

1227
01:17:15,317 --> 01:17:17,678
I've felt it
ever since I came back...

1228
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:20,081
but I didn't want
to believe it.

1229
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,843
I couldn't make myself
believe that...

1230
01:17:22,963 --> 01:17:25,685
Waldo was a murderer.

1231
01:17:25,765 --> 01:17:29,648
- Well, he is.
- He didn't really kill Diane Redfern.

1232
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:31,850
- I killed her.
- What are you talking about?

1233
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:36,174
But I did, Mark. I did as surely
as if I'd pulled the trigger myself.

1234
01:17:36,294 --> 01:17:38,176
That's nonsense.
Forget it.

1235
01:17:38,255 --> 01:17:41,979
No, Mark, I can't.
I'm as guilty as he is...

1236
01:17:42,059 --> 01:17:46,023
not for anything I did,
but for what I didn't do.

1237
01:17:47,504 --> 01:17:51,347
But I couldn't help myself.
I owed him too much.

1238
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:58,633
I can understand that,
Laura...

1239
01:17:58,713 --> 01:18:02,316
but I can't understand why you've tried so
hard to protect Shelby these last few days.

1240
01:18:02,397 --> 01:18:04,518
I was nearly frantic for fear
you'd arrest Shelby.

1241
01:18:04,638 --> 01:18:07,481
I knew he wasn't guilty.
He hasn't enough courage to kill a fly.

1242
01:18:07,601 --> 01:18:10,604
And Waldo was doing everything
he could to incriminate him.

1243
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:12,725
It was his way
of getting rid of Shelby...

1244
01:18:12,806 --> 01:18:14,727
just as he did Jacoby.

1245
01:18:17,289 --> 01:18:19,371
I must say, for a charming,
intelligent girl...

1246
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:22,974
you've certainly surrounded yourself
with a remarkable collection of dopes.

1247
01:18:24,655 --> 01:18:27,338
Don't touch anything.
Fingerprints will be important.

1248
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,421
I'll have the clock
picked up tomorrow.

1249
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,543
- What are you going to do?
- Arrest Waldo.

1250
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:36,146
- Mark.
- Can't be helped.

1251
01:18:42,471 --> 01:18:44,953
That's to make sure
you're not disturbed.

1252
01:18:45,033 --> 01:18:47,355
If the doorbell rings,
don't answer it.

1253
01:18:47,435 --> 01:18:51,118
- I'll phone you in the morning.
- Good night, Mark.

1254
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:54,241
Get some sleep. Forget
the whole thing like a bad dream.

1255
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:45,936
And thus,
as history has proved, love is eternal.

1256
01:20:46,056 --> 01:20:49,740
It has been the strongest motivation
for human actions...

1257
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:51,942
throughout centuries.

1258
01:20:52,021 --> 01:20:54,463
Love is stronger than life.

1259
01:20:54,544 --> 01:20:57,026
It reaches beyond
the dark shadow of death.

1260
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,468
I close this evening's
broadcast...

1261
01:21:00,549 --> 01:21:03,431
with some favorite lines
from Dowson.

1262
01:21:03,511 --> 01:21:05,433
"Brief Life."

1263
01:21:07,194 --> 01:21:11,037
"They are not long,
the weeping and the laughter...

1264
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:14,041
"love and desire
and hate.

1265
01:21:15,361 --> 01:21:17,724
"I think they have
no portion in us...

1266
01:21:17,843 --> 01:21:20,486
after we pass the gate."

1267
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:23,968
- Who's tailing Lydecker?
- I was going to, when he came out.

1268
01:21:24,049 --> 01:21:26,771
- He left five minutes ago.
- He didn't come out this way.

1269
01:21:26,891 --> 01:21:29,974
Must've gone out the back way.
Come on. Let's check.

1270
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:35,459
"They are
not long, the days of wine and roses.

1271
01:21:35,539 --> 01:21:39,502
"Out of a misty dream,
our path emerges for a while...

1272
01:21:39,622 --> 01:21:41,864
then closes within a dream."

1273
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,907
- That's the way it is, isn't it, Laura?
- Waldo!

1274
01:21:46,028 --> 01:21:48,269
You have
heard the voice of Waldo Lydecker...

1275
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:50,191
by electrical transcription.

1276
01:21:50,271 --> 01:21:54,355
Waldo, you've taken one life.
Isn't that enough?

1277
01:21:54,434 --> 01:21:58,878
The best part of myself...
that's what you are.

1278
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:01,601
Do you think I'm going to leave it
to the vulgar pawing...

1279
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:04,763
of a second-rate detective
who thinks you're a dame?

1280
01:22:04,844 --> 01:22:07,486
Do you think I could bear the thought
of him holding you in his arms...

1281
01:22:07,566 --> 01:22:10,088
kissing you, loving you?

1282
01:22:11,089 --> 01:22:13,331
Laura! It's Mark.
Open the door!

1283
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:15,373
- There he is now.
- Laura!

1284
01:22:15,452 --> 01:22:18,775
He'll find us together, Laura...

1285
01:22:18,855 --> 01:22:21,978
as we always have been, as we always
should be, as we always will be.

1286
01:22:29,584 --> 01:22:31,426
Mark!

1287
01:22:42,156 --> 01:22:44,077
Good-bye, Laura.

1288
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:55,447
Good-bye, my love.

1288
01:22:56,305 --> 01:23:02,689
