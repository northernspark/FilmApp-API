2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,534
Whoo-ha!

3
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:26,734
Ha ha ha!

4
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:27,868
Hey!

5
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:30,567
Choctaw!

6
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:40,701
Let her burn, boys!

7
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:48,834
...and I hate storekeeper's whiskey!

8
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,100
Have 'em mount up, Harv.

9
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:06,167
Oh, my god!

10
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,534
Get 'em out of here.

11
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,634
Gimme that!

12
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,200
Sober up, Choctaw!

13
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:14,400
Mount up!

14
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,601
We're ridin' back to Sabbath now.

15
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,234
Yep.

16
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,367
Whoa. Whoa.

17
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:27,067
Aw, stay still.

18
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,300
Hyah!

19
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:40,467
Here.

20
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,534
It's my brother-in-law,
Marc Corman.

21
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,434
Who?

22
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm Jered Maddox.

23
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:30,834
Cotton Ryan.

24
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:36,000
You the marshal?

25
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,367
What can I do for you, Maddox?

26
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:40,734
Vincent Bronson, Choctaw Lee,

27
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,334
Jack Dekker, Vern Adams,

28
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,367
Hurd Price, Harvey Stenbaugh,

29
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:48,167
Marc Corman. Know any of 'em?

30
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,667
All of 'em.

31
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,234
Well, that makes it easy.

32
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,501
Does it?

33
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,601
I want these men
brought in under arrest

34
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,834
by noon tomorrow.

35
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:00,000
I want 'em fed and ready for travel.

36
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:02,133
You got papers sworn out?

37
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,734
I'll get 'em if you need 'em.

38
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,367
Not from anybody in this
territory, you won't.

39
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,033
You've got jurisdiction.

40
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,834
I've got jurisdiction,

41
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,834
but you couldn't have reason enough

42
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,300
to get papers from me. Nobody could.

43
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,968
3 months ago, Bronson
took 8,000 head of cattle

44
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,133
across the Kiowa.

45
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,067
On the way back, they
hit a town called bannock.

46
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,267
They drank their
fill, had their women,

47
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,467
shot up the town.

48
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:31,033
All just cowboy fun.

49
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,634
They killed an old man.

50
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,100
Kin?

51
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,200
No.

52
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,601
I'm just the lawman in bannock.

53
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,868
Look at this town.

54
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:44,834
Nice quiet town.

55
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,501
Nice town to live in.

56
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,167
They got no railhead, no
digging up in the hills,

57
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:52,200
no reason to grow fat.

58
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:54,267
This town eats
because Vincent Bronson

59
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:56,067
puts their bread on the table.

60
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:58,167
He owns the town.

61
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:00,367
He owns the county.

62
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:04,133
People around here owe him.

63
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,067
Those men on your list...
they stand in Bronson’s shadow.

64
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:09,100
I can't move against those men.

65
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,834
You carry the law.

66
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:14,534
Humph. I carry nothin'.

67
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:18,434
I sit there 'cause Bronson says sit.

68
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:23,267
I've been paid for, Maddox.

69
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:26,167
You carry messages, don't you?

70
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm gonna take these men back with me

71
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:30,100
or kill them where they stand.

72
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,801
They got till noon tomorrow.

73
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:32,901
Tell 'em.

74
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,601
That one of them out there?

75
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,067
Corman.

76
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:39,267
You can take his name off the list.

77
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:42,200
What happened?

78
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:46,801
He called me out.

79
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,601
What's the trouble?

80
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,667
What happened, marshal?

81
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:05,767
Better come inside, Sam.

82
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:07,534
One of you take Corman
to the undertaker's

83
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:10,501
and the rest of you go
on about your business.

84
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,634
As a member of the
citizens council...

85
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:15,434
you can get it
secondhand from the mayor.

86
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,334
How far from here to
the Bronson spread?

87
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
I wouldn't know.

88
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:49,200
Who's he, some bounty
hunter or something?

89
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:52,901
Don't make an enemy
of him, storekeeper.

90
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,601
Step wide of him.

91
00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:01,834
That's about it, Mr. Bronson.

92
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:05,367
He said by noon tomorrow.

93
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:07,100
And Marc Corman's dead?

94
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,534
He's dead.

95
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,100
How'd it happen?

96
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:14,634
Came up against the wrong man.

97
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,367
I don't know the details.

98
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,400
Marc was a good man with a gun.

99
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,667
He was a big mouth

100
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:23,033
who thought he was a
good man with a gun.

101
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,100
There's a cold hole in the
ground between the 2 of 'em.

102
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,367
His family know?

103
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,667
I sent word.

104
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:34,767
I'll ride out there in the morning.

105
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:38,033
How do you measure
this thing, cotton?

106
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,167
I think you got trouble, Mr. Bronson.

107
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,767
Unless you say he's all mistaken.

108
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,167
I wish he was.

109
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,601
There's no mistake.

110
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,868
We got a little drunk,
broke a bit of glass.

111
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:53,801
I didn't know anyone was killed.

112
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:56,901
Tell Maddox I’m sorry, really sorry,

113
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,334
and I’ll make it good.
I'll pay the damages.

114
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,734
I'll fix it up with
the old man's family.

115
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:05,667
Tell him I’ll make it
all right with him, too.

116
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:07,901
Better still, arrange
a meeting tomorrow.

117
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:11,033
I’ll... I’ll deal straight with him.

118
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,801
If he doesn't want to talk?

119
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:14,934
Why shouldn't he?

120
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,567
Some men just go to a thing

121
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,400
in a straight line, Mr. Bronson.

122
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,367
They don't bend,
and they don't trade.

123
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,901
You're telling me
Maddox is like that?

124
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,234
He's got the mark.

125
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,567
That's too bad.

126
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:31,634
Then he's going to buy
himself a lot of pain.

127
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:34,100
Try him, cotton. Talk to him.

128
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,934
He got you spooked, Ryan?

129
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,501
No, Harv. I'm not on his list.

130
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,234
That all, Mr. Bronson?

131
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,400
Yeah.

132
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,734
All right, Harv. Chew it out.

133
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:56,534
I don't like askin' favors.

134
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,100
No one's asking you

135
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,868
to bend your knee, Harv.

136
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:01,701
Just to talk.

137
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,934
Some worn-out tin star

138
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,133
wouldn't rate cuttin' your cigars.

139
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,901
Ryan doesn't rate him that low.

140
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:10,033
Ryan's a kicked dog.

141
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,901
Well, maybe that's what makes him

142
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:13,834
a better judge of men like Maddox.

143
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,634
There was a time...

144
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,501
it's in the past, Harv.

145
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,100
What do you want to do,

146
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,167
ride into Sabbath and gun him down?

147
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,701
Those days have passed.

148
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:27,300
Times have changed.

149
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:30,167
There are other ways. You buy him.

150
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:33,667
And if he doesn't sell,
you buy the man above him.

151
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:36,968
Those killing days
were for younger men.

152
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm on that list, Vince.

153
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:42,467
I'm not ridin' his
dust back to bannock.

154
00:13:42,534 --> 00:13:45,367
Neither am I.

155
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:47,000
The others will be here soon.

156
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,501
I'd send Jason and Crowe.

157
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,634
We'll talk then.

158
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:54,868
We don't need the others.

159
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,601
We'll talk.

160
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,968
It's your land.

161
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,701
It's your grass.

162
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,501
You've never been on wages, Harv.

163
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,000
What's out there

164
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,767
is as much yours as mine.

165
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,868
10 years too long, Jered?

166
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,467
Hello, Laura.

167
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,400
Can I come in?

168
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:54,133
Sure.

169
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,167
It don't seem 10 years.

170
00:14:56,234 --> 00:15:01,901
To me, it does.

171
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,667
Won't you sit down?

172
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,801
You look good, Laura.

173
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:16,267
You're a soft-tongued liar.

174
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,734
You live in Sabbath?

175
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:21,601
Near. What... what
are you doing here?

176
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,334
Oh.

177
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,601
That's not an honest question.

178
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,767
I know what you're doing here.

179
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,934
I was in town getting some supplies,

180
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,868
and I heard about it.

181
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:38,033
Do you think you owe
me anything, Jered?

182
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,601
Say it out plain, Laura.

183
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,501
My man, Hurd Price,

184
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:48,567
he's one of the men you want.

185
00:15:48,634 --> 00:15:51,968
I guess it had to be
something like that.

186
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:54,400
He work for Bronson?

187
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,801
No.

188
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:58,534
We have a small farm

189
00:15:58,601 --> 00:16:00,434
between here and the high country,

190
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,667
and he takes work from Bronson

191
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,033
when he can get it.

192
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,834
Let him go, Jered.
He never shot anybody.

193
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:10,434
He stands with the rest.

194
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:11,567
Sorry, Laura.

195
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:13,167
The hell you are.

196
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:15,534
Nobody has to die.

197
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,767
Just tell him to come into
town and give himself up.

198
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,868
What will happen to him then?

199
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:24,467
He'll go back to
bannock and stand trial.

200
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:26,501
Will they hang him?

201
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,501
Circuit judge is no hanging judge.

202
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:31,367
In fact, a man like
Bronson could buy him cheap.

203
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:33,400
I don't... I don't
mean just the judge.

204
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,567
I mean the town, the
good people with the rope.

205
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,567
My town, Laura.

206
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:40,467
Nobody gets a mob rope in my town.

207
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,734
You know that. I give you my word.

208
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,234
If he comes in peaceful,

209
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,200
there will be no hurt come to him.

210
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:49,901
You never did give much away.

211
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,367
Would you come, Laura,

212
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:56,567
if your man hadn't been on the list?

213
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:58,267
No.

214
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:01,167
There's nothing left
over from before, Jered.

215
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:02,701
Good-bye.

216
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,601
He has until tomorrow.

217
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,701
I called you in 'cause
we've got trouble.

218
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,267
You remember last spring

219
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:37,901
we took a herd over the Kiowa.

220
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:39,667
We hit a town called bannock

221
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:42,868
on the way back.

222
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:45,868
7 of us went into
town. Do you recall?

223
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:50,000
None too clearly.

224
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:52,234
We shot up the town.

225
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,567
Seems an old man took a bullet.

226
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:01,334
We thought it was nothing
but a lot of broken glass,

227
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,801
but...

228
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:06,067
seems now it's a bit more.

229
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:08,167
Now, the hard point of the matter

230
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:11,100
is there's a lawman
the name of Maddox

231
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,801
in Sabbath.

232
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:16,501
Figures to take us back
and stand trial for murder.

233
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,467
One lawman?

234
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,267
Ryan thinks he's enough.

235
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:28,067
Cotton Ryan.

236
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:31,534
Choctaw, you may not
think much of Ryan

237
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,100
as he stands now,

238
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,701
but...

239
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:40,868
in his day, you couldn't
walk in the same sun as him.

240
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,634
Hey, where's Marc Corman?

241
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,033
Marc Corman's dead.

242
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,501
Corman's dead

243
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,601
'cause he called
short on this Maddox.

244
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:51,501
Marc Corman's dead?

245
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:56,534
I called ya here to hear
what you have to say.

246
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:59,167
Well, Vern?

247
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,801
I don't know, Mr. Bronson.

248
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:03,834
I don't want trouble,

249
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,334
I appreciate ya askin'
us here for our opinion,

250
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,033
but it seems to me you got
some choice, and I don't.

251
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,801
I can't go back to bannock.

252
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:13,033
If I do, my land dries
up and blows away.

253
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,033
My beef gets scattered
into the high country.

254
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,434
I don't have the hands to
keep my spread tied down.

255
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,601
You know I’d see ya right, Vern.

256
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,400
I'd send some of the boys,

257
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,868
give my mark to cover your losses.

258
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:27,834
Thanks, and I know you mean it,

259
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,734
but I have to work my own.

260
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, what do you suggest, Vern?

261
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,701
I don't suggest anything,

262
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,934
and I don't aim to do anything.

263
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,133
Just stay close and mind what's mine.

264
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,300
And if he comes after you?

265
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,534
I'll stop him if I can.

266
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:46,868
Stop him first and make sure.

267
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,167
I didn't kill anybody
that night in bannock.

268
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:52,300
I've got no quarrel with the law.

269
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,033
You, Choctaw?

270
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,033
You give the orders, Mr. Bronson.

271
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,033
I asked for an opinion.

272
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,133
It was an accident.

273
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
If that lawman wants to lean hard,

274
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,067
then I say we set him running.

275
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:08,367
I go along with Choctaw,

276
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:10,667
but, uh, as he says, Mr. Bronson,

277
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:13,701
you give the orders.

278
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,667
Hurd?

279
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:19,300
Well, then, I’d like to hear

280
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,167
what you have to say, Vince.

281
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,167
Want your say, Harv?

282
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:28,033
I say we tell the lawman to
peddle his law in bannock.

283
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,334
You got all the guns
you need, Mr. Bronson...

284
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,634
just for the asking.

285
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,934
Maddox needs a lesson taught.

286
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
Can I say something, pop?

287
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:39,467
Now, I wasn't ever in bannock,

288
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:41,067
but it seems to me if pa here

289
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,934
is willing to pay for the damages,

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,868
give the old man's family something,

291
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:46,934
then this Maddox
has no cause to push.

292
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,334
If he does, I think Harv's right.

293
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,033
There are 2 men dead already.

294
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,868
That's a bit heavy.

295
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:57,467
I don't think this Maddox runs easy,

296
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:59,100
and killing a lawman

297
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,234
is a certain way for trouble.

298
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,834
I'll talk with him.
Maybe he has a Price.

299
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:08,234
Maybe he's a reasonable man.

300
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,534
If not, all we've
lost is a few hours.

301
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:14,067
If we decide to go back,

302
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,734
I’ll cover any of your losses.

303
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,100
Most we'd face is a fine, anyway,

304
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,267
if that.

305
00:21:21,334 --> 00:21:25,200
We'll try it my way.

306
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,100
Our food's been laid out.

307
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,834
Vern, Hurd, will you
gentlemen be my guests?

308
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:35,968
Choctaw, show 'em
where to get washed up.

309
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:38,200
When it comes down to bedrock,

310
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,434
my word don't call
much, does it, Vince?

311
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm just hired help.

312
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:46,434
No man means more to me, Harv.

313
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:49,667
All I’ve got is you and Jason.

314
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:52,067
But you're like some
yellow, dumb ladino...

315
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,701
all longhorn and no brains.

316
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:56,701
We've got 10,000 head of good cows,

317
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,367
a valley of sweet grass,
and money in the bank.

318
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:02,033
That didn't come easy.

319
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,701
We both us put 30
years of sweat into it.

320
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:10,701
I don't want to drop
it on some dumb gunplay.

321
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,801
I don't like to see
you backing off, Vince.

322
00:22:14,868 --> 00:22:17,934
You're making a mistake.

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,701
I don't see it that way.

324
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:24,300
Ride into Sabbath in
the morning, see Ryan.

325
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:28,534
Hear how he made out. I
want to step around this.

326
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:32,567
If Maddox is open, tell
Ryan to set up a meeting.

327
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,434
Send Jason.

328
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:37,267
I'm asking you.

329
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,968
Keep clear of Maddox.

330
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,767
Take Crowe with you.

331
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:58,100
It's a great life.

332
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,834
If you were some cheap gunsel

333
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:02,100
with a big name running
out in front of ya,

334
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,200
they'd all be buying you drinks,

335
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:07,133
rubbing up against you,

336
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,367
fixing up what they're
gonna tell the kids

337
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:12,234
and the ones who weren't there.

338
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,601
But if you're a lawman,
you're a disease.

339
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,834
They need you, but they hate you.

340
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:20,367
Comes with the job.

341
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:23,501
I saw Bronson.

342
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:24,901
He wants to talk.

343
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,067
Talk?

344
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,200
He wants to trade.

345
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:30,501
He says he's sorry.

346
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:33,534
He means it. I know him.

347
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:36,601
He didn't know anybody was killed.

348
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,667
He wants to make it all good.

349
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,567
Something for my pockets, too.

350
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:44,601
Why not?

351
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:47,033
You could hear what he's got to say.

352
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,601
I just heard.

353
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,334
The old man was just an accident.

354
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,801
They'll get a chance

355
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:53,067
to say their piece in bannock.

356
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,200
Be reasonable, Maddox.

357
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,467
Good night, Ryan.

358
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,234
There will be some dyin'.

359
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,033
It'll be their doin'.

360
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,734
Mr. Bronson?

361
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:40,767
What are you doing out here, Crowe?

362
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:43,067
We just brought a
couple of hundred head up

363
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,901
from Bornite creek, Mr. Bronson.

364
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:47,133
I saw a rider, and, uh...

365
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,701
who else is with you?

366
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:54,033
Uh, Hitchins and Jason, sir.

367
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,767
You and my son are about
the same age, aren't you?

368
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,834
Uh, Jason’s a bit younger...

369
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:02,667
5, 6 months.

370
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,567
Ever been up here before?

371
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:07,434
No, sir. I figured it was private.

372
00:25:07,501 --> 00:25:09,100
On this high ground,

373
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:13,467
you can see the whole
valley on a clear day,

374
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:18,567
from the sierras to white wolf pass.

375
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:22,567
Now, there was the old
Comanche camp. We...

376
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:24,400
we broke 'em there.

377
00:25:24,467 --> 00:25:27,634
Harvey and me and my brothers.

378
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,033
Brother Jacob died there.

379
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:38,300
They were fine people, the Comanches.

380
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:41,834
Don't ever listen to any
talk that runs down an Indian.

381
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:51,300
We buried brother Jacob here and...

382
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,267
my other brother Aaron beside him.

383
00:25:54,334 --> 00:26:00,801
They'd had enough
of guns and killing.

384
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:05,000
The dead don't have much.

385
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:07,033
Crowe, did you ever feel the world

386
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,534
turn beneath your feet?

387
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:15,167
No, sir.

388
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,667
You best be getting back down, son.

389
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,033
Choctaw, the kid had the edge.

390
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,667
You're sand-blind, Jack.

391
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,534
You take him on, Jack.

392
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,267
$5, Choctaw?

393
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,567
That's like stealing
from a blind man's cup.

394
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:40,901
That's fair.

395
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:43,167
I figure Crowe’s just
emptied your cup, Lee.

396
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,000
What do you say, Crowe?

397
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,467
I guess about even.

398
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:48,634
Even?

399
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:50,968
Sonny, you were way behind...

400
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:52,400
again.

401
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:55,067
The top man takes
Dekker’s money from him.

402
00:26:55,133 --> 00:27:00,567
1, 2, 3.

403
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,167
I want those cattle

404
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,234
down at the wolf pass tomorrow night.

405
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,834
Crowe, you come with me.
We gotta go into Sabbath.

406
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:11,067
Sure, Harv.

407
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,934
Gonna fight on that lawman, Harv?

408
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,767
Move your ass out of here, Lee.

409
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,567
Wait a minute, Mr. Stenbaugh.

410
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,300
I fancy a bit of tin star.

411
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:22,701
I'll leave enough for you
to cut your first teeth on.

412
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,300
You're a gentleman.

413
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:28,100
Choctaw.

414
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,367
What do you think he's gonna do?

415
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:32,534
Chew the hell out of that law dog.

416
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,834
Maddox.

417
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:09,534
Mr. Maddox, Mr. Maddox, your room...

418
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:13,334
what I mean is we are
getting a regular...

419
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,234
a drummer of women's goods.

420
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,334
And jewelry, and, well, you see,

421
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,767
I wasn't expecting
you to be staying over,

422
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:24,067
and, well, to put a
fine edge on things,

423
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:25,734
I need your room.

424
00:28:25,801 --> 00:28:28,234
You see, he always expects
to get the same room,

425
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,200
and l... I can't... oh...

426
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:47,334
is there something you wanted?

427
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,968
Can't say there is, minister.

428
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:51,801
A man comes to the house of god,

429
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,167
he comes to seek.

430
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:55,133
I'm not a believing man, minister.

431
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,400
Then why have you come?

432
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:00,601
A man doesn't see many
churches like this...

433
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,334
in a town like Sabbath.

434
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,534
The shape of the house
of god is unimportant.

435
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,968
That's not so, minister.

436
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,968
The kind of church a
man builds to pray in

437
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,901
tells you a lot about the man.

438
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:13,133
Further south,

439
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,868
there are some fine,
old adobe churches.

440
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:17,767
Mexican. They're cool and dark inside

441
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:20,167
to give a man peace.

442
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:22,868
They're made for kneeling.

443
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,367
This one's made for standing upright.

444
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:28,767
There is no easy comfort from god.

445
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,334
Tell me, minister,

446
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,434
you must know all the
people in this town.

447
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:35,100
Those who come to my church.

448
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,834
I don't see a land office.

449
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,834
If I wanted to see a
map of the territory,

450
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:41,167
a map with the deed
boundaries marked on it,

451
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:42,934
who might be able to oblige?

452
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,834
Why do you ask me?

453
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:46,767
I figured you'd be the
one man in this town

454
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:52,067
who would find it
difficult to lie to me.

455
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:54,734
Mr. Dusaine is the legal expert.

456
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:56,667
He takes care of all such matters.

457
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:58,734
Thank you, minister. Good morning.

458
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:18,100
My, it's beautiful.

459
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,734
Oh! That's him!

460
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:31,601
Mr. Dusaine?

461
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,901
You have the deed maps
for this territory.

462
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:37,300
I'd like to see them.

463
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,367
And who, pray tell, told you...

464
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:41,067
the minister.

465
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,501
Well, I’m afraid that I
would need written permission

466
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,834
before I could allow you
to examine such documents.

467
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,801
Sir! I shall call the marshal.

468
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:00,200
You do that.

469
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:07,334
Thank you, Mr. Dusaine.

470
00:31:39,734 --> 00:31:42,067
Don't try to soften me up, cotton.

471
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,734
Doesn't your lawman want to talk?

472
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,634
Take it easy, Harvey.

473
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:48,100
Yes or no?

474
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,167
Why do you want to push things

475
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,601
until they break, Stenbaugh?

476
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:51,868
Let Bronson handle it.

477
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:53,133
You gonna mealy-mouth,

478
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,801
or are you gonna tell me?

479
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,267
He won't trade.

480
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:59,467
You can have your say in bannock.

481
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:02,434
Did you crawl, Ryan?

482
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:04,601
I wasn't asked to.

483
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:08,033
I told Vince you weren't
the man to carry this.

484
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,567
Where is Maddox?

485
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:11,033
Climb down, Harvey.

486
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,734
You can't ride this man.

487
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:14,901
Run to hell, why don't you?

488
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,767
Maddox?

489
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:37,501
I'm Harv Stenbaugh.

490
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:47,834
Well, lawman?

491
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:49,133
What's your name, son?

492
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,634
Crowe wheelwright.

493
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,701
I've no business with you.

494
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:55,434
You've got business with me.

495
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,100
Drop that gun belt.

496
00:32:57,167 --> 00:33:00,434
I'm taking you in.

497
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:02,234
No, you're not.

498
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,634
You got 2 ways to move, lawman.

499
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,300
Run...

500
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:07,734
or take me.

501
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,234
Don't make me kill you, son.

502
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,767
What are you gonna do about this?

503
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:55,200
He's shooting 'em down in the street.

504
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,467
You all know why you're here.

505
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,868
What I want to know is
what are we gonna do?

506
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,133
He wants to know what
we're going to do.

507
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,567
Marc Corman and Harvey
Stenbaugh were our friends.

508
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:38,167
Do we care about our friends?

509
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:41,234
Corman's widow, my sister,
and the little ones,

510
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,167
do we care about them?

511
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:46,267
Are we just gonna stand
around here and talk?

512
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:50,667
Talk never moved a
thing or pulled a stump.

513
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:52,334
Are we gonna stand around and wait

514
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,567
while this killer shoots down

515
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,234
whoever he wants in our town?

516
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,901
He's a lawman.

517
00:34:57,968 --> 00:34:59,400
What? What?

518
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,000
How do we know that?

519
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,400
Anyway, he ain't the lawman here.

520
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,334
What happened in bannock months ago

521
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,067
is of no concern to us,

522
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:09,701
but we must respect the law.

523
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:13,701
As your mayor, I say we
gotta protect our own.

524
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:16,234
This man has got to be stopped.

525
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,634
What you got in mind, Harris?

526
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:21,167
We all go over to
the hotel, all of us,

527
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:22,868
and we go meaning business,

528
00:35:22,934 --> 00:35:25,234
and that means going armed.

529
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,400
And we can tell Maddox
to get out of town.

530
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:30,667
Now, now, wait a minute, Luther.

531
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:33,234
That sounds like vigilante talk.

532
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,133
Shouldn't we stay
within the limits of...

533
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,033
Sam, Sam. It seems to
me that you, as mayor,

534
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,367
should be giving lead, you know,

535
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:44,534
not trying to keep
your head on straight.

536
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,400
This town owes Vince Bronson a lot.

537
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,801
Legally speaking,
there is a precedent

538
00:35:49,868 --> 00:35:52,100
for forming a citizens committee.

539
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,167
Only if there's been a breakdown

540
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,334
in the formal law services.

541
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Well, Ryan is broken down enough

542
00:35:58,467 --> 00:35:59,934
to satisfy any precedent.

543
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,334
Moss is right, you know.

544
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,968
We're all beholding to Bronson,

545
00:36:04,033 --> 00:36:05,801
and a Bronson man was murdered.

546
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:09,400
Now, we can talk till sundown
and accomplish nothing,

547
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,267
or we can act.

548
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:14,200
Now, I say that we
call off this meeting

549
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:16,267
and do what we know is right.

550
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,000
Now, Luther, let's...

551
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:20,667
anybody here who calls
himself a man who wants out

552
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:26,868
better speak right now.

553
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,934
Anybody?

554
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,334
Well, then I think we got
our work cut out for us.

555
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,667
Oh, dear.

556
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:48,434
You know what that man meant to me?

557
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:51,968
I held him above all other men.

558
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:54,801
Closer even than my brothers.

559
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:58,033
I want him, Ryan.

560
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,801
I want him broken.

561
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:03,767
I want his face in the dirt.

562
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:05,667
And I’ll hang what's left of him

563
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:07,434
hang him for the murderer he is.

564
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,934
I don't care how. I don't care who,

565
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,634
so long as I’m there to see it.

566
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:15,901
It wasn't murder, Mr. Bronson.

567
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,701
I call it murder.

568
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:18,801
I was on the prod...

569
00:37:18,868 --> 00:37:22,000
I call it murder...

570
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:26,267
and I want something done about it.

571
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:29,234
The great cotton Ryan,

572
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,000
you were good with a gun once.

573
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:34,067
Oh, you were beautiful.

574
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,267
But fort bliss was a long time ago,

575
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:41,667
wasn't it, Ryan?

576
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:45,100
I don't like men
sweating fear in my house.

577
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:49,434
You pay me, Mr. Bronson,
and I eat your dirt.

578
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,033
But that don't make
what you say right.

579
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,000
Get out.

580
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:56,467
When I’m finished, Mr. Bronson.

581
00:37:56,534 --> 00:38:01,567
Leave him.

582
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:04,934
Harvey was on the prod.
He went after Maddox.

583
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,934
He put the horn in him,

584
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,067
and then he made his move first.

585
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,734
Don't make the same
mistake, Mr. Bronson.

586
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:12,567
Don't go to a man like
Maddox with a hammer.

587
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:14,434
You want him. I understand that.

588
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,467
I figured that was your play.

589
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:19,601
But finish that thing
in bannock first.

590
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:22,534
Go back there.

591
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,734
You can buy the whole town...

592
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:31,300
and the judge that goes with it.

593
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:33,667
Ryan...

594
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,067
I’m sorry.

595
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:45,834
We'll get Maddox.

596
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:48,868
Yes...

597
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:53,100
we'll get Maddox.

598
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,534
My heart isn't in it.

599
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:59,734
God's my witness, Jace,
I wanted no more killing.

600
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,534
I could've bought that
town with a whisper.

601
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:04,400
Ryan's right.

602
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,868
But not now.

603
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,734
Harvey's death finished any chance

604
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:15,067
of doing it without guns.

605
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:20,167
Damn you, Harvey.

606
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:21,567
He's in the saloon.

607
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:22,434
Who is?

608
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:23,467
Let's go.

609
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:54,968
Which one has the words?

610
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:56,567
You're the storekeeper.

611
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:59,467
Luther Harris, ain't it?

612
00:39:59,534 --> 00:40:02,434
Let me say them for you.

613
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,467
You want me out of your town.

614
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:05,701
What happened some other time,

615
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,968
some other place ain't your trouble.

616
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,901
I've seen men like you
in every town in the west.

617
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:12,801
You want the law, but
you want it to walk quiet.

618
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:17,067
You don't want it to put
a hole in your pocket.

619
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,334
You take courage from each
other, and you come armed.

620
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,234
Well, there are enough of you.

621
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,534
All you need is one man with
enough stomach to die first.

622
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:36,067
I'm not leaving until
what I came for is done.

623
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:37,734
So if you plan to
do anything about it,

624
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:38,801
do it now or go home.

625
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:08,167
How much?

626
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:09,133
For the meal.

627
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,667
2 bits.

628
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,033
Jesus, I thought for sure they...

629
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,934
good evening, cotton.

630
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Lucas.

631
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:34,367
Cards?

632
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:36,100
A dollar a point?

633
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,334
You know I can't
run that high, Lucas.

634
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,033
You got my note for
more than I can ever pay,

635
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,968
and still you want to play.

636
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,167
I'm not calling in your note.

637
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,067
I'm not a great believer in
the milk of human kindness.

638
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:57,701
You got a rope on
the man who owes you.

639
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:58,968
Hit me.

640
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,300
Yours.

641
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,567
You got a weight on
your back, cotton.

642
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:14,567
Is that the gossip?

643
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,667
I've heard.

644
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:17,868
Besides,

645
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:20,334
you've been here last
night and tonight.

646
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,067
Now, you're not an indulging man.

647
00:42:23,133 --> 00:42:24,567
Call.

648
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:26,868
A man's pleasure talks a lot.

649
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,968
Now, ain't that pretty?

650
00:42:29,033 --> 00:42:33,367
Hit me.

651
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:36,634
May I be of service, cotton?

652
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:39,000
I got me a mess, Lucas.

653
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:42,767
And I haven't got enough
long boot to step out of it.

654
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:44,100
Let's play cards.

655
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:49,601
Well, cottontail Ryan.

656
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,801
Cottontail Ryan.

657
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,467
You wanted something, Dekker?

658
00:42:54,534 --> 00:42:55,934
Yeah, I want something.

659
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,100
I want some more of
your cheap whiskey.

660
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:01,901
Service in your place stinks.

661
00:43:01,968 --> 00:43:06,200
And you're a damn fool to come here.

662
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:10,300
He smells of trouble.

663
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,868
I'm all right.

664
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:48,067
Maddox!

665
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:01,968
Maddox!

666
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:33,300
I'm calling you out, Maddox.

667
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:35,200
We've no quarrel, Crowe.

668
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:36,567
I'm gonna kill you, Maddox.

669
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:37,968
I'm not gonna fight you, boy.

670
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:39,100
Stand.

671
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:41,534
I don't plan on dying for no reason.

672
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,534
Ease up.

673
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,234
You cheap little gunslinger.

674
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,400
You set me up.

675
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:11,834
So help me god.

676
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:13,701
Go on for your gun.
You want a chance?

677
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:14,801
Go ahead.

678
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:15,734
I don't know nothing
about those shots.

679
00:45:15,801 --> 00:45:16,968
Go for your gun.

680
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:19,701
I wouldn't do something
like that. Believe me!

681
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:22,000
It came from over there.

682
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:26,667
My town, Maddox.

683
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,501
Aah.

684
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:25,968
Aah!

685
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,300
Drop it.

686
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,434
Get up.

687
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,133
Ugh.

688
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,667
Aah!

689
00:46:37,734 --> 00:46:41,400
Come on.

690
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:44,767
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

691
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:20,767
Next time I see you, I’ll kill you.

692
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:33,601
God knows I got reason enough
to want to see you dead,

693
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,767
but I hate back shooters.

694
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:37,200
If you've got nowhere
important to go,

695
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:43,534
I got a bottle in that desk.

696
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:45,367
Dekker's on your list.

697
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:46,534
He a Bronson hand?

698
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:50,200
Yeah. Stays close to Choctaw Lee.

699
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,334
Choctaw's a gun hand,

700
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,234
fast and likes his work.

701
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,367
Dekker's a shadow walker.

702
00:47:54,434 --> 00:47:55,834
He walks big when he's with Choctaw,

703
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:58,434
but a back shooter inside.

704
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,167
I knew it'd be him.

705
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:01,634
I saw him in town earlier.

706
00:48:01,701 --> 00:48:04,167
Thanks, Ryan.

707
00:48:04,234 --> 00:48:06,133
I owe you something, too.

708
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:12,267
I feel good.

709
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:15,868
I remember you at fort bliss.

710
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,300
Well, that's my trouble.

711
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:20,534
Everybody remembers me at fort bliss.

712
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:21,901
That's all I got, Maddox,

713
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,834
a bunch of yesterdays.

714
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,701
It's a long ride down
from the high country

715
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:28,634
with stops all the way down.

716
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:30,133
In Abilene, I ran.

717
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,901
In Acadia city, I hid in a cellar.

718
00:48:32,968 --> 00:48:34,133
In Monmouth,

719
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,167
the Loring brothers made me eat dirt.

720
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:40,234
What keeps pushing you?

721
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,367
I've been a lawman for 20 years.

722
00:48:42,434 --> 00:48:46,234
What stops you running sand inside?

723
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,467
I guess the question doesn't arise.

724
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:49,801
You know, after killing Stenbaugh,

725
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:53,200
Bronson will come for you.

726
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:56,267
It's always the same.

727
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,467
You post a man,

728
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,434
he has to come into
town to prove he's a man.

729
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:02,400
You kill a man, he's
got a friend or a kin,

730
00:49:02,467 --> 00:49:04,834
just has to come against you.

731
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,868
And for no reason...

732
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:08,567
no reason that makes any sense.

733
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:09,767
And it don't matter a damn

734
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:12,767
to the man already in the ground.

735
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:16,033
Nobody wins.

736
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,834
You can stop it.

737
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:19,968
Ride out tomorrow.

738
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:22,100
It's not a private
matter with me, cotton.

739
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,100
The law.

740
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:27,200
The honest ones carry it hard
and clean all their lives.

741
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:30,100
Behind their backs, the
others buy it, sell it,

742
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,434
dirty it, tie it into knots.

743
00:49:33,501 --> 00:49:36,067
Who lives longer, Maddox?

744
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:37,167
I was out bringing in a killer

745
00:49:37,234 --> 00:49:39,000
when the shoot-up happened.

746
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,100
I could have chased a few tracks

747
00:49:40,167 --> 00:49:42,167
and let the matter drop.

748
00:49:42,234 --> 00:49:44,267
But I’m the law in bannock.

749
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:45,567
Anybody who goes against the law

750
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,200
goes against me.

751
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:49,467
I don't know any other way.

752
00:49:49,534 --> 00:49:52,000
How many more for one old man?

753
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:54,567
I don't call the numbers.

754
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:56,968
Ryan, I never drew first
on a man in my life.

755
00:49:57,033 --> 00:49:58,501
That's the only way to stay clean.

756
00:49:58,567 --> 00:49:59,634
You play it by the rules.

757
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:01,567
Without the rules, you're nothing.

758
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:02,868
Bronson won't come alone.

759
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:04,734
I didn't figure he would.

760
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,701
You think he sent Dekker. He didn't.

761
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:09,167
Well, I don't know that. Do you?

762
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:12,167
I know Bronson.

763
00:50:12,234 --> 00:50:14,334
Either way, it don't matter.

764
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,767
Good night, Ryan.

765
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,868
Let me go, cotton.

766
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:23,767
Let me go.

767
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:25,868
What's the matter with you, Ryan?

768
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:27,667
Let me out of here!

769
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,501
You're through, Ryan.

770
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:32,234
Bronson's gonna walk
you into the ground.

771
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:38,667
You're all through, cottontail.

772
00:50:38,734 --> 00:50:41,200
Calculate you got about
10 minutes, back shooter.

773
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:42,968
It'll take me 5 to get to Maddox,

774
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:45,133
and Maddox 5 to get saddled.

775
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,334
I think he'd appreciate
a little hunting.

776
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,467
Or I can gun you down
trying to escape...

777
00:50:50,534 --> 00:50:53,701
in the back.

778
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:54,901
You won't be so...

779
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,901
back shooter, anytime you want out...

780
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,400
you just call.

781
00:51:14,534 --> 00:51:16,067
Hold on, Crowe.

782
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:17,334
You look like you got your teeth

783
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,167
set on edge, boy. Now move!

784
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:23,033
I didn't know nothing about Dekker.

785
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,634
You don't even interest me, Crowe.

786
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:25,534
Where's your horse?

787
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:26,534
Tied up behind the stables.

788
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:28,067
All right. Let's go.

789
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:29,567
Listen to me, Ryan.

790
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:31,934
I didn't know about
Dekker. You ask him.

791
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,501
Well, Maddox called my name
down in front of everybody.

792
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:35,634
I ain't afraid of him, Ryan.

793
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:36,801
You would be

794
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:39,200
if you had brains enough to spit.

795
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:41,100
Well, I figure I’m faster than him.

796
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,868
Keep walking.

797
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,234
In every town Maddox has worked,

798
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,100
the ground is full of
men who were faster.

799
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:47,968
Yeah. Well, I really am.
I aim to prove it, too.

800
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:49,901
It makes a great epitaph.

801
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:51,067
You may be faster.

802
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:52,334
You may even be better with a gun,

803
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,767
but Maddox will kill you.

804
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,601
And that's a fact.

805
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,067
You'd be staring up at nothing

806
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:59,501
before your gun even got clear.

807
00:51:59,567 --> 00:52:01,968
I know what I’m talking about, Crowe.

808
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:03,334
You might not rate me very high,

809
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,834
but I know men like Maddox.

810
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:29,267
You'd drive a man to
hell, wouldn't you, Jered?

811
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:31,400
Hello, Lucas.

812
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:32,667
Whose day for choosing is it,

813
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:34,501
Price or Adams?

814
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:36,234
You know this Adams?

815
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,534
I know him.

816
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,601
What kind is he?

817
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,234
I wouldn't know.

818
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,200
But I know what you're
doing is wrong, Maddox.

819
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:46,434
You were wrong in san Acoma,

820
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:48,000
and you're wrong here.

821
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:50,367
Not from where I stand.

822
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:52,734
You can't see from where you stand.

823
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,767
I didn't want to wake you.

824
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,567
Where were you?

825
00:53:11,634 --> 00:53:13,601
Over at Vern’s place.

826
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:15,300
Sorry.

827
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:17,267
Where are you going?

828
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:18,868
Go back to bed, Laura.

829
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:21,801
Where are you going,
Hurd? I want to know.

830
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:24,400
Go back to bed, will you, please?

831
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,334
You're running, aren't you, Hurd?

832
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,133
Do you have to, Laura?

833
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,000
No, I don't have to.

834
00:53:31,067 --> 00:53:32,434
Damn you!

835
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,734
Always got to push my
face in it, don't you?

836
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,801
You and this god-cursed land.

837
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:37,934
Yes, I’m running!

838
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,200
Does that make you happier?

839
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:44,667
You said you'd give yourself up.

840
00:53:44,734 --> 00:53:46,801
Well, that was before
Harv was killed.

841
00:53:46,868 --> 00:53:48,968
I'm talking about you, Hurd.

842
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:50,901
I don't care about Harvey Stenbaugh.

843
00:53:50,968 --> 00:53:53,067
He doesn't make any difference.

844
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:54,934
Harv Stenbaugh was my friend.

845
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,467
You hated him.

846
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:57,767
You were frightened of him,

847
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,300
and he never cared about anything

848
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:04,667
unless it had the Bronson name to it.

849
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:08,767
You lying bitch!

850
00:54:08,834 --> 00:54:10,200
You are a nobody,

851
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:12,601
just a little nobody to them.

852
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,801
I owe Vince everything I’ve got.

853
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:16,501
You owe him what?

854
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,934
This piece of dirt that
wouldn't grow wheat.

855
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,467
And what do you owe Harvey?

856
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:22,434
He kept you on your
knees saying thank you.

857
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:25,267
Hurd, they just don't care.

858
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:28,434
But you do.

859
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,167
Yes.

860
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,501
That's not what I see
every time I look at you.

861
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,033
You know what I see?

862
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,267
I see, "you're not much, Hurd Price."

863
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:39,434
No, not a man, like all
the men you've known.

864
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:50,400
I didn't mean that.

865
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:54,467
Yes, you did.

866
00:54:54,534 --> 00:54:58,367
And maybe you're right.

867
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:02,701
Maybe that is what's in my face...

868
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,968
I don't think so.

869
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:07,200
I've tried, Hurd.

870
00:55:07,267 --> 00:55:10,167
And I don't want to see you dead.

871
00:55:10,234 --> 00:55:13,334
I can't go in alone, Laura.

872
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,167
The others won't go in now...

873
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:17,868
not to surrender.

874
00:55:17,934 --> 00:55:20,534
Here's Vern.

875
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:25,167
But Maddox promised
nothing would happen to you.

876
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:31,801
What did you promise him?

877
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:33,334
I'll be back.

878
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,334
When you turn around,

879
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,934
keep your arms straight
out from the body.

880
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,434
I told you the next time
I saw you, I’d kill you.

881
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:53,400
I knew nothing about Dekker.

882
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:54,601
So you said.

883
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:57,167
It's true.

884
00:56:57,234 --> 00:57:02,734
I just wanted you to know.

885
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,334
You ride for Bronson?

886
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,234
Yeah, I ride for him.

887
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,868
Does he send you out
to do his killing?

888
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:10,968
No. And he didn't send me out here

889
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:12,300
this morning, neither.

890
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,133
You just took it upon yourself.

891
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,067
What for, a pat on the head?

892
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,801
You killed Harvey Stenbaugh.

893
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,734
You got a bad memory, son.

894
00:57:19,801 --> 00:57:21,834
Stenbaugh had it in mind to kill me.

895
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:24,100
He didn't have a chance.

896
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,667
You don't even care, do you, Maddox?

897
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,834
No.

898
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:30,200
No, I don't care.

899
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:32,767
You say he didn't have a chance.

900
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,400
He went for his gun first.

901
00:57:34,467 --> 00:57:35,434
When he does that,

902
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,701
he uses up all his chances.

903
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:39,200
Do I have to keep my arms up here...

904
00:57:39,267 --> 00:57:42,701
till I say different.

905
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:44,801
You liked Stenbaugh?

906
00:57:44,868 --> 00:57:46,067
Well, then I’m sorry, Crowe,

907
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:47,934
but he had a lot of chances.

908
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,067
He didn't have to come
into town that morning.

909
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,434
He didn't have to cross the street

910
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,801
and push it to a shooting.

911
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,334
He could've given himself up.

912
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,868
You wouldn't have done no different.

913
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:57,167
You're wrong.

914
00:57:57,234 --> 00:58:00,868
I wouldn't put living
down on cheap pride.

915
00:58:00,934 --> 00:58:06,701
You can drop your arms.

916
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:09,534
Still planning on trying to kill me?

917
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:11,033
I don't know.

918
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,300
But I ain't afraid of you.

919
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,501
I never said you were.

920
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:17,901
Any fish in that stream?

921
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:20,734
Some natives and some bullheads.

922
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:21,868
Hungry?

923
00:58:21,934 --> 00:58:23,267
I didn't come out here...

924
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:27,334
having breakfast ain't
gonna make us friends.

925
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,267
You got another line?

926
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:30,968
In the saddlebag.

927
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:44,234
Ryan thinks you're pretty good.

928
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,400
Says you could've killed
me any time you wanted to.

929
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:49,701
I say different.

930
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:52,400
I think I’m faster.

931
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:53,801
You asking me who's faster

932
00:58:53,868 --> 00:58:56,100
or whether I could
kill you if I chose to?

933
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,601
Because if it's the second,

934
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,067
the answer is yes.

935
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:06,000
You're pretty damn sure.

936
00:59:06,067 --> 00:59:08,734
I'm pretty damn sure.

937
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:11,100
You think it's a game, don't you?

938
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:17,033
A contest between gentlemen.

939
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,667
You ever kill a man, Crowe?

940
00:59:20,734 --> 00:59:22,734
You're a cowman.

941
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:24,534
You carry a side-gun for protection.

942
00:59:24,601 --> 00:59:26,934
Snakes.

943
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,667
You learn to use it
sometimes fairly well.

944
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:35,267
Sometimes you become really good.

945
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:38,734
But you're still a cowman.

946
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:40,367
I'm a lawman.

947
00:59:40,434 --> 00:59:42,434
You know what a lawman is, Crowe?

948
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,734
He's a killer of men.

949
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:46,167
That's what the job calls for.

950
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,300
There are nicer ways to put it,

951
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:49,434
but it reads the same.

952
00:59:49,501 --> 00:59:51,234
That's the difference between us,

953
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,400
and it's all the difference I need.

954
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:55,667
Maddox!

955
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,067
Being fast don't count for much.

956
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:08,300
It's what you learn in the trade.

957
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:11,133
You read a man.

958
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,534
You believe me? About last night?

959
01:00:13,601 --> 01:00:15,200
I don't think you'd
trail a man so hard

960
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:20,467
so early in the morning
just to tell a lie.

961
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,634
If you're heading for
Vernon Adams' place,

962
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:24,033
better expect trouble.

963
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,434
<I>He'll be waitin'.</I>

964
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:27,367
Good morning, mayor.

965
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:28,300
'Morning, marshal.

966
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:29,701
Nice morning.

967
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:32,334
Just a minute, marshal.

968
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,634
He's left town.

969
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:35,767
Who?

970
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:38,033
He rode out this morning, I heard.

971
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,501
We wanna make sure
he don't come back.

972
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:41,834
I just come from the minister

973
01:00:41,901 --> 01:00:43,968
and the church-going women.

974
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,868
Seems y'all got the same complaint...

975
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,567
but none of you have any reason

976
01:00:48,634 --> 01:00:50,701
for me to post Maddox out of town.

977
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:52,601
I told you we were wasting our time.

978
01:00:52,667 --> 01:00:54,634
He's running scared of Maddox.

979
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:57,367
What we need is some
real vigilante talk.

980
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:59,567
Well, I heard you tried that once...

981
01:00:59,634 --> 01:01:03,934
then went scuttling
back to your wives.

982
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,400
Maybe if you keep trying,

983
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:08,367
you can find some brave man
to shoot Maddox in the back.

984
01:01:08,434 --> 01:01:10,400
Now I suggest you
fine, upright gentlemen

985
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:12,334
go about your business.

986
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,067
If you can't keep the
dirt off the street,

987
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:16,801
Ryan, we can... and we will.

988
01:01:16,868 --> 01:01:18,467
You're all mouth, Luther,

989
01:01:18,534 --> 01:01:19,801
mouth and gut wind.

990
01:01:19,868 --> 01:01:22,567
You won't do much more
than scratch yourself.

991
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,400
Look, down there.

992
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:53,400
What is it, Vern?

993
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:54,734
Maddox.

994
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,300
What are you gonna do?

995
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:57,601
End it here.

996
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:01,167
You sure it's Maddox?

997
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:02,267
I'm sure.

998
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:03,467
He hasn't seen us, Vern.

999
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:04,734
We could get through the pass.

1000
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:07,000
I said if he came
after me, I’d kill him.

1001
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:01,234
Jesus, wait!

1002
01:04:24,434 --> 01:04:27,133
Come on, come on!

1003
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,434
Come on!

1004
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:10,467
Over there!

1005
01:05:10,534 --> 01:05:13,501
Hold him still.

1006
01:05:13,567 --> 01:05:14,701
Bring 'em on up

1007
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:16,367
hold 'em steady.

1008
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:42,534
7 unmarked,

1009
01:05:42,601 --> 01:05:44,667
with the wolf creek
bunch, Mr. Bronson.

1010
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:45,601
Mark 'em.

1011
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:48,567
Some'll be Adams'.

1012
01:05:48,634 --> 01:05:52,708
Cut out his brand
and give 'em to him.

1013
01:05:57,801 --> 01:05:59,300
What do you mean, you don't know?

1014
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:01,133
I just don't know.

1015
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,100
You knew last night.

1016
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:07,868
Oh, did I?

1017
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:09,968
I can't figure you, Crowe.

1018
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:11,701
You ain't scared of
him, so what is it?

1019
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,033
Well, maybe I just don't think

1020
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,200
it's the right way to do things.

1021
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:17,434
Maybe... I don't think it's my fight.

1022
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:19,801
I just don't know.

1023
01:06:19,868 --> 01:06:22,067
Maybe I don't think it
should take 4 or 5 guns

1024
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:24,467
to go against one man.

1025
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:26,300
He murdered Harvey.

1026
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:28,801
I know what happened, Jace.

1027
01:06:28,868 --> 01:06:31,701
I was there, remember?

1028
01:06:31,767 --> 01:06:33,300
I thought we were friends.

1029
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:35,000
We are...

1030
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:39,701
and I didn't say I wouldn't.

1031
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:42,267
I just wanna think on it.

1032
01:06:42,334 --> 01:06:44,701
Well, you better think right...

1033
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:48,434
if you wanna ride for this brand.

1034
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:33,400
Your run is over, mister.

1035
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:34,534
Drop your rifle.

1036
01:08:49,901 --> 01:08:51,501
Now the side gun.

1037
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:05,734
Walk ahead.

1038
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:08,400
That's far enough.
Turn around and sit.

1039
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:17,300
You Price or Adams?

1040
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:18,501
Adams.

1041
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:20,601
Keep one thing in mind, Adams.

1042
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:26,267
Make it difficult, you're a dead man.

1043
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:27,434
Let's go.

1044
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:38,601
How did you know who I was?

1045
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:39,934
I was in town when you brought in

1046
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,033
Corman's body.

1047
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,667
And you thought you
were better than him.

1048
01:09:43,734 --> 01:09:45,934
No, I didn't.

1049
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,567
I didn't kill anybody that night,

1050
01:09:47,634 --> 01:09:48,801
and I can't afford the time

1051
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:51,000
to go back and stand trial.

1052
01:09:51,067 --> 01:09:52,968
I got under 100 head
and nobody but a woman

1053
01:09:53,033 --> 01:09:55,133
and my old dog to
hold down that place.

1054
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,767
If I’m gone more than a week,
I got nothing to come back to.

1055
01:09:57,834 --> 01:10:00,400
You have no right
to take that from me.

1056
01:10:08,267 --> 01:10:09,501
Drop it.

1057
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,567
I told you to drop it.

1058
01:10:45,434 --> 01:10:48,467
What do you want, Price?

1059
01:10:48,534 --> 01:10:53,267
I just come by to pay
my respects, Vince.

1060
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:55,133
When's the buryin'?

1061
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,000
Soon.

1062
01:10:57,067 --> 01:11:00,133
I'd appreciate it if I could attend.

1063
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,033
You'll be welcome.

1064
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,734
Can I stay, Vince?

1065
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:08,868
J-just for the night, I mean.

1066
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:11,000
You must excuse me.

1067
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:13,767
She'll show you to your room.

1068
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:18,234
Thanks, Vince.

1069
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,667
When are you going after that Maddox?

1070
01:11:21,734 --> 01:11:24,033
When the dead are buried.

1071
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,834
He needs killin'!

1072
01:11:26,901 --> 01:11:29,667
No man needs killing.

1073
01:11:29,734 --> 01:11:34,000
I was only thinking of Harv.

1074
01:11:34,067 --> 01:11:39,767
We're all thinking of Harv.

1075
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:42,033
It took guns to get this land,

1076
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,434
guns to keep it, guns
to make things grow.

1077
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:49,067
The guns that pride called out...

1078
01:11:49,133 --> 01:11:54,667
and each time, we buried the cost.

1079
01:11:54,734 --> 01:11:57,701
I'll see you, Price, at the buryin'.

1080
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:14,167
I wouldn't think a few
beef and a scrub ranch

1081
01:12:14,234 --> 01:12:21,100
would be worth dying for, mister.

1082
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:22,667
We're leaving.

1083
01:12:45,834 --> 01:12:48,400
<I>O, omnipotent god...</I>

1084
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:51,734
alone and unbending in thy heaven,

1085
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:53,133
accept with mercy

1086
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,300
into thy judgment this, thy child.

1087
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:58,868
Molded from the cold shard

1088
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:02,033
and fired with a soul
warmed in thy presence

1089
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,901
comes forth man,

1090
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,467
to struggle and move unbowed

1091
01:13:07,534 --> 01:13:10,767
through this harsh world alone,

1092
01:13:10,834 --> 01:13:13,801
to be tested by life...

1093
01:13:13,868 --> 01:13:17,200
to be confused by passion...

1094
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:21,234
to be tempted and
brought down by evil...

1095
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,067
to seek for the light
that the soul knows

1096
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,234
and never turns away from,

1097
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,534
and then to return
from whence he came...

1098
01:13:28,601 --> 01:13:31,367
again, alone,

1099
01:13:31,434 --> 01:13:33,267
to stand in awed finality

1100
01:13:33,334 --> 01:13:34,801
before thy gaze

1101
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,868
and give account.

1102
01:13:36,934 --> 01:13:39,701
Such is man's destiny,

1103
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:42,434
and from the hardness
comes forth a purity

1104
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,234
that soft men can never find.

1105
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,868
Such a man was this, our brother,

1106
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:51,200
who now we bury here.

1107
01:13:51,267 --> 01:13:52,100
Amen.

1108
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:55,100
Amen.

1109
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,868
Now let us each man

1110
01:13:56,934 --> 01:14:02,934
unto his own god pray.

1111
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,934
And now let us sing unto the lord.

1112
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:18,801
we should've gone together, Harv.

1113
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:37,701
Hush!

1114
01:14:44,534 --> 01:14:47,200
He's not here. I'm alone. He's run.

1115
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:49,601
Got a prisoner here
needs a bit of care.

1116
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,334
Got a hole in him.

1117
01:14:57,501 --> 01:14:59,901
Vern, where's Hurd?

1118
01:14:59,968 --> 01:15:01,767
He's run free, Laura.

1119
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:09,667
Can you get the bullet out?

1120
01:15:09,734 --> 01:15:10,901
Not if I want to kill him.

1121
01:15:10,968 --> 01:15:13,334
It'll have to be cut
out through the back.

1122
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:20,567
Oh, gosh!

1123
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,234
We can put him in the bed.

1124
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,901
He goes outside.

1125
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,634
Get up.

1126
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:42,133
He's hurt bad.

1127
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,133
Someday I’ll get a second
chance at you, Maddox,

1128
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,400
and I won't miss.

1129
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:47,133
Don't push it, Adams.

1130
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:59,434
I've got some food warming.

1131
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:01,834
How do you like the Price farm?

1132
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:03,534
Over there we grow corn...

1133
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,300
for the weevils,

1134
01:16:05,367 --> 01:16:06,701
and out in back, the potatoes

1135
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:09,868
fried black in the
ground from the sun.

1136
01:16:09,934 --> 01:16:11,701
We do own a few head of stock

1137
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:16,534
to keep the Borefly
happy and the crows.

1138
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:17,868
It's not much, but I guess

1139
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:21,033
it's more than you got, Jered.

1140
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,400
You married to this Price fella?

1141
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:26,501
No preachers and no flowers...

1142
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:30,801
but I’m his woman, Jered.

1143
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:33,000
That food will be done now.

1144
01:16:41,334 --> 01:16:43,434
Does he have to stay
out there all night?

1145
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:45,934
He does.

1146
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,801
You haven't changed much.

1147
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:52,234
Not much.

1148
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,000
I hear canyon city's a ghost town.

1149
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:58,667
Digging's dried up.

1150
01:16:58,734 --> 01:17:00,901
The "golden promise."

1151
01:17:00,968 --> 01:17:04,033
Well, it had a good
run for its money.

1152
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,200
Remember Bucky?

1153
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:08,000
Where's Bucky now?

1154
01:17:08,067 --> 01:17:10,367
He's dead. Charlottesville.

1155
01:17:10,434 --> 01:17:12,767
Somebody named Yancey, I heard.

1156
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:13,968
Buck tried to take him in,

1157
01:17:14,033 --> 01:17:17,300
gave him too much edge, I guess.

1158
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:20,601
And Joe Wilmot?

1159
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:23,067
Him, too. Shot in the back.

1160
01:17:23,133 --> 01:17:24,434
Ben Tilson...

1161
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:25,701
Luther Thompson...

1162
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:27,367
bill Chrysler...

1163
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,567
all gone.

1164
01:17:29,634 --> 01:17:31,734
Jack horn will never walk again.

1165
01:17:31,801 --> 01:17:35,934
I'm sorry, Jered.

1166
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,133
A lot of candles to light.

1167
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,200
Can I... take something out to Vern?

1168
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:44,167
Go ahead.

1169
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:54,767
Get me something to cut
loose from these irons

1170
01:17:54,834 --> 01:17:56,667
and a gun if you've got one.

1171
01:17:56,734 --> 01:17:58,667
Please, Laura!

1172
01:17:58,734 --> 01:18:00,200
No, Vern, he'll kill you.

1173
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:01,667
No, he'll go after Hurd next,

1174
01:18:01,734 --> 01:18:03,300
maybe kill him.

1175
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:04,801
Now, with a gun and
him not expecting it,

1176
01:18:04,868 --> 01:18:07,234
I could stop him.

1177
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:09,934
Eat your food.

1178
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,133
I'll get you another blanket.

1179
01:18:18,934 --> 01:18:20,334
Promise me that you won't try

1180
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,868
to kill Maddox,

1181
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:24,067
that you'll just go.

1182
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:25,434
He'd come after me.

1183
01:18:32,634 --> 01:18:35,801
It turned colder. Can I
take him another blanket?

1184
01:18:47,868 --> 01:18:51,167
Laura...

1185
01:18:51,234 --> 01:18:52,534
thanks for supper.

1186
01:19:05,067 --> 01:19:07,367
Promise me, Vern, that you'll go.

1187
01:19:07,434 --> 01:19:08,968
Just go.

1188
01:19:09,033 --> 01:19:12,067
I got no more run in me.

1189
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:13,534
If you get me a gun, I have more than

1190
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:15,567
a better chance to get him.

1191
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:18,300
He'll check me again
before he beds down.

1192
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:22,367
He won't expect nothing.

1193
01:19:22,434 --> 01:19:24,033
You've got to!

1194
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,200
I was gonna give it to him.

1195
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:54,634
Do you want to know why

1196
01:19:54,701 --> 01:19:56,367
I was gonna give him the gun?

1197
01:19:56,434 --> 01:19:59,033
He's hurt, he's a friend...

1198
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,834
there are a lot of reasons.

1199
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:03,434
I wanted to because of you.

1200
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:05,601
Because there's nothing
soft in you, Jered,

1201
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,200
there's nothing forgiving.

1202
01:20:07,267 --> 01:20:09,000
Even this damn land
doesn't hold a man down

1203
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:12,400
as hard as you do.

1204
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:16,067
What made you change your mind?

1205
01:20:16,133 --> 01:20:19,200
It wouldn't make any difference.

1206
01:20:19,267 --> 01:20:20,667
You'd kill him or go after him,

1207
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:23,567
or he'd kill you.

1208
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,100
I didn't want that.

1209
01:20:32,901 --> 01:20:35,968
The sword of Gideon.

1210
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:39,300
How do you see yourself, Jered?

1211
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,534
What are you asking, girl?

1212
01:20:41,601 --> 01:20:42,868
For me to let Adams go?

1213
01:20:42,934 --> 01:20:44,868
Forget about Price,
Bronson and the rest?

1214
01:20:44,934 --> 01:20:46,033
Would that be so terrible?

1215
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,267
You know I can't do that.

1216
01:20:47,334 --> 01:20:49,267
You hold the law too high.

1217
01:20:49,334 --> 01:20:51,701
You always did.

1218
01:20:51,767 --> 01:20:53,167
Would it really make any difference

1219
01:20:53,234 --> 01:20:54,367
if just once...

1220
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:56,100
you can't play with
it like that, Laura.

1221
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:58,567
There is no "just once."

1222
01:20:58,634 --> 01:21:00,868
Next time it might be a friend...

1223
01:21:00,934 --> 01:21:02,901
or money in your hand...

1224
01:21:02,968 --> 01:21:05,200
or maybe you get scared...

1225
01:21:05,267 --> 01:21:08,133
and then it becomes
one more "just once."

1226
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,434
Soon you don't know who you are.

1227
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:12,734
You can't break the rules, Laura.

1228
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,467
Oh...

1229
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:17,901
the rules...

1230
01:21:17,968 --> 01:21:21,667
I forgot about the rules.

1231
01:21:21,734 --> 01:21:23,968
You think they change the killing.

1232
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:26,067
Because you never
draw on a man first,

1233
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:29,567
you think that really matters?

1234
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:36,868
Do you know what
they call you, Jered?

1235
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,934
"The widow-maker."

1236
01:21:50,434 --> 01:21:52,434
I have a harsh tongue, Jered Maddox,

1237
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:56,033
and then I’m always saying I’m sorry,

1238
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,267
and there's no use
your being out there...

1239
01:21:59,334 --> 01:22:01,767
wanting to be in here and...

1240
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,234
me in here wishing
that you'd come to me.

1241
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:24,801
oh, you took a damn long time...

1242
01:22:24,868 --> 01:22:26,868
how did you get here?

1243
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:28,133
Huh?

1244
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,400
This place, I mean.

1245
01:22:32,467 --> 01:22:36,234
After canyon city,
there was tombstone.

1246
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,033
Then I went north to Ellsworth.

1247
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,367
That's where I met Hurd,

1248
01:22:41,434 --> 01:22:43,434
and he brought me here.

1249
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:46,834
Why do you stay?

1250
01:22:46,901 --> 01:22:50,300
I've used up too many places.

1251
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:53,767
Besides, I owe Hurd.

1252
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:56,467
He's kind and tender...

1253
01:22:56,534 --> 01:23:00,434
when there's time to
be kind and tender.

1254
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:04,067
He left you here.

1255
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:06,868
He's frightened.

1256
01:23:06,934 --> 01:23:08,601
Terrible thing, to
be frightened, Jered.

1257
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:11,200
You wouldn't know.

1258
01:23:11,267 --> 01:23:13,767
You don't leave a man like him much.

1259
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:30,334
Come back with me.

1260
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,934
Would you quit?

1261
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,467
I've thought about it.

1262
01:23:36,534 --> 01:23:38,400
25 years and all you've got

1263
01:23:38,467 --> 01:23:39,767
is a gun and not enough ground

1264
01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:44,267
to throw over you.

1265
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:48,133
Come back to bannock.

1266
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:53,801
Laura.

1267
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:56,801
I've always loved you, Jered.

1268
01:23:56,868 --> 01:24:00,467
But I would rather have
this dead land and Hurd Price

1269
01:24:00,534 --> 01:24:04,067
than the cold waiting
that I’d have with you.

1270
01:24:04,133 --> 01:24:07,434
Do you still carry
that whistle thing?

1271
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,501
You mean the flute.

1272
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:10,801
Do you?

1273
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:16,868
In the saddlebag.

1274
01:24:16,934 --> 01:24:23,234
Play me something.

1275
01:24:53,534 --> 01:24:58,100
Any free land around here?

1276
01:24:58,167 --> 01:25:01,534
I asked you a question, mister.

1277
01:25:01,601 --> 01:25:03,000
Only high up.

1278
01:25:03,067 --> 01:25:05,167
South of the river there's
some for the buying.

1279
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:07,701
Good land?

1280
01:25:07,767 --> 01:25:09,400
Men like you don't buy land, Maddox.

1281
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:13,968
You don't buy it,
and you don't work it.

1282
01:25:27,601 --> 01:25:30,234
Can't I handle this
myself, Mr. Bronson?

1283
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,801
No.

1284
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,601
Find Crowe?

1285
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:40,667
Quit.

1286
01:25:40,734 --> 01:25:47,200
Rode out earlier with his stuff.

1287
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,400
This locks in with you, Hurd.

1288
01:25:48,467 --> 01:25:53,067
You gonna ride with us?

1289
01:25:53,133 --> 01:25:57,267
A man's got to stand sometime!

1290
01:25:57,334 --> 01:26:00,300
I'll just get my things.

1291
01:26:00,367 --> 01:26:02,234
Get Price an animal!

1292
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:14,367
Whoa!

1293
01:26:14,434 --> 01:26:15,534
Hyah!

1294
01:26:15,601 --> 01:26:16,934
Hyah! Hyah!

1295
01:26:24,534 --> 01:26:31,300
You need some breakfast.

1296
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,634
I hear you might have trouble

1297
01:26:47,701 --> 01:26:49,834
from the citizens.

1298
01:26:49,901 --> 01:26:51,901
Harris.

1299
01:26:51,968 --> 01:26:55,634
Seems he's trying to
throw a lot of sand.

1300
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:58,400
What does a man like
that want, Lucas?

1301
01:26:58,467 --> 01:26:59,934
A name.

1302
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,901
He hungers for the name
in bold, proud letters.

1303
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:05,100
When Maddox comes back,

1304
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:08,667
you could have big trouble, cotton.

1305
01:27:08,734 --> 01:27:11,067
If Maddox comes back.

1306
01:27:11,133 --> 01:27:12,834
He'll come back.

1307
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:15,934
He might need help.

1308
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,167
I tell you, Lucas,

1309
01:27:17,234 --> 01:27:21,167
if I had somewhere
to run to, I’d run.

1310
01:27:21,234 --> 01:27:24,801
But I don't, so I’ll stand.

1311
01:27:24,868 --> 01:27:27,501
And the storekeeper and his friends?

1312
01:27:27,567 --> 01:27:30,667
I don't know.

1313
01:27:30,734 --> 01:27:35,767
You knew Maddox from before?

1314
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:40,033
You never said.

1315
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,634
From where?

1316
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:43,701
Claremont, canyon city,

1317
01:27:43,767 --> 01:27:45,400
san Acoma.

1318
01:27:45,467 --> 01:27:46,934
Friend?

1319
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,567
Used to be.

1320
01:27:48,634 --> 01:27:51,033
And now?

1321
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,234
There's been trouble between us.

1322
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,133
I killed a man in san Acoma.

1323
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,434
Maddox called it against me,

1324
01:27:57,501 --> 01:28:00,000
posting me out of town.

1325
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:01,868
He called it wrong, but...

1326
01:28:01,934 --> 01:28:06,033
that's how it stayed.

1327
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:07,100
Harris and his friends

1328
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:09,367
don't have the tail for gunplay.

1329
01:28:10,534 --> 01:28:11,400
Such a man was this,

1330
01:28:11,467 --> 01:28:13,767
our brother Marc Corman,

1331
01:28:13,834 --> 01:28:16,467
who now we bury here.

1332
01:28:16,534 --> 01:28:17,601
Amen.

1333
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:19,033
Amen.

1334
01:28:34,834 --> 01:28:36,334
Better get him to a doctor.

1335
01:28:48,567 --> 01:28:50,567
Who is that woman?

1336
01:28:50,634 --> 01:28:51,434
Corman's widow.

1337
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:03,934
Murderer!

1338
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,501
Tell moss and Cobden
to meet at my store.

1339
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:34,968
How? That's what I
wanna know, Luther.

1340
01:29:35,033 --> 01:29:37,033
The next time he
steps into the street.

1341
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:39,334
You and moss, upstairs.

1342
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,200
Totts, Hersham, and
me here in the store

1343
01:29:41,267 --> 01:29:42,567
and out in the alley.

1344
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:45,100
You mean cut him
down, just like that?

1345
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:46,701
Just like that.

1346
01:29:46,767 --> 01:29:47,901
Does that bother you?

1347
01:29:47,968 --> 01:29:49,100
We're not gunfighters.

1348
01:29:49,167 --> 01:29:51,167
We can't do it straight out.

1349
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:52,567
It's not as if it was murder,

1350
01:29:52,634 --> 01:29:53,901
him a killer and all.

1351
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:55,067
More like a hangin'.

1352
01:29:55,133 --> 01:29:56,501
He's standing on the
neck of this town,

1353
01:29:56,567 --> 01:29:59,467
that's for damn sure.

1354
01:29:59,534 --> 01:30:00,801
What's the matter, Cobden?

1355
01:30:00,868 --> 01:30:03,534
I got no taste for it.

1356
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:07,133
Ah. I had you down for a man.

1357
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,100
You talk a big noise, Luther,

1358
01:30:09,167 --> 01:30:11,033
but Maddox put water
between your legs

1359
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:12,300
once before,

1360
01:30:12,367 --> 01:30:16,607
and I think maybe the
mold is set that way.

1361
01:30:28,434 --> 01:30:29,801
Ryan?

1362
01:30:29,868 --> 01:30:32,501
Be right out.

1363
01:30:32,567 --> 01:30:34,767
Doc says Adams can't
travel for a few days.

1364
01:30:34,834 --> 01:30:38,367
He's busted up inside.

1365
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:40,400
When he gets better...

1366
01:30:40,467 --> 01:30:42,667
let him go.

1367
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:44,167
Tell him he can go back to his land.

1368
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:45,601
The others, too.

1369
01:30:45,667 --> 01:30:48,167
Tell him it's finished.

1370
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:50,100
I'm pulling out.

1371
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:51,868
You?

1372
01:30:51,934 --> 01:30:53,634
What happened out there?

1373
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:56,400
Nothing happened.

1374
01:30:56,467 --> 01:30:58,968
A man like you doesn't
let go that easy,

1375
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:00,667
not for no reason.

1376
01:31:00,734 --> 01:31:03,701
I guess I just looked around me.

1377
01:31:03,767 --> 01:31:06,167
Anyway, soon there'll
be no more towns

1378
01:31:06,234 --> 01:31:07,901
like bannock,

1379
01:31:07,968 --> 01:31:11,601
towns that need a gun like mine.

1380
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:15,100
I guess yours is the
right way, cotton.

1381
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:18,767
Sit out the years.
Find a nice, quiet town,

1382
01:31:18,834 --> 01:31:21,501
one that pays a better house toll.

1383
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:22,901
Don't do it my way, Maddox.

1384
01:31:22,968 --> 01:31:24,934
Quit clean.

1385
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,934
Buy you a drink?

1386
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,100
No, thanks.

1387
01:31:28,801 --> 01:31:30,367
Bronson just rode into town.

1388
01:31:30,434 --> 01:31:35,167
There's 4 of 'em.

1389
01:31:35,234 --> 01:31:36,567
Who's he with?

1390
01:31:36,634 --> 01:31:38,501
His son Jason, Choctaw Lee,

1391
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:40,734
and Hurd Price.

1392
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:42,534
I'd say you bought
more than you can chew

1393
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:43,801
this time.

1394
01:31:43,868 --> 01:31:46,067
You figure you've got a say in this?

1395
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:49,100
I wouldn't want to see
you get it in the back.

1396
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:52,901
We've done... too many towns.

1397
01:31:52,968 --> 01:31:54,501
You don't owe me, Lucas.

1398
01:31:54,567 --> 01:31:57,434
Well, let's say I need the action.

1399
01:31:57,501 --> 01:32:01,033
You and I sit at the
same table, Jered.

1400
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,200
The virtuous need us, but, hah!

1401
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:07,067
They don't like the smell.

1402
01:32:07,133 --> 01:32:08,968
Maddox?

1403
01:32:09,033 --> 01:32:10,534
Damn fools!

1404
01:32:10,601 --> 01:32:12,501
I'll go out and talk to them.

1405
01:32:12,567 --> 01:32:15,133
Leave it be.

1406
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,901
A man gets caught in his own doing.

1407
01:32:17,968 --> 01:32:19,067
You can't change what you are,

1408
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,067
and if you try,

1409
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:23,821
something always calls you back.

1410
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:28,834
Cotton?

1411
01:32:28,901 --> 01:32:31,434
I can't.

1412
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:32,667
I got no stomach

1413
01:32:32,734 --> 01:32:37,567
for that kind of shootin' anymore.

1414
01:32:42,501 --> 01:32:44,501
Which one is Hurd Price?

1415
01:32:44,567 --> 01:32:46,601
The one on the end,
next to the old man.

1416
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:48,734
Watch Lee, on your right.

1417
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:51,968
He's the gun hand.

1418
01:32:59,934 --> 01:33:02,868
Crowe!

1419
01:33:02,934 --> 01:33:05,000
Please let me talk to 'em, Maddox.

1420
01:33:05,067 --> 01:33:06,934
Jason and me were never in bannock.

1421
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,567
We went to Abilene.

1422
01:33:11,634 --> 01:33:13,334
Hear me out.

1423
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,067
Jason and me are friends.

1424
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:18,467
I'll kill you if I have to, Maddox!

1425
01:33:18,534 --> 01:33:20,133
No need to, son.

1426
01:34:01,467 --> 01:34:04,534
Whoa!

1427
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,734
Aah!

1428
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,467
Oh! Ow...

1429
01:34:46,767 --> 01:34:48,534
there's been enough.

1430
01:34:59,133 --> 01:35:01,834
He's going.

1431
01:35:01,901 --> 01:35:02,701
He killed Harvey.

1432
01:35:02,767 --> 01:35:04,934
You can't let him go!

1433
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,467
Maddox!

1434
01:35:09,534 --> 01:35:10,567
It's over, Jason.

1435
01:35:10,634 --> 01:35:11,501
I don't crawl.

1436
01:35:11,567 --> 01:35:12,901
He'll kill you.

1437
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:13,868
Get your hands off of me!

1438
01:35:13,934 --> 01:35:15,267
I'm not afraid of him!

1439
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:17,567
Harvey would walk fire for you.

1440
01:35:25,567 --> 01:35:29,434
He's my son, Maddox.

1441
01:35:29,501 --> 01:35:31,000
Don't beg him!

1442
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:49,367
Oh!

1443
01:35:49,434 --> 01:35:51,133
Ohh... ohh...

1444
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,367
ohh...

1445
01:36:14,167 --> 01:36:15,133
ahh!

1446
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,467
Oh!

1447
01:36:17,634 --> 01:36:20,167
Oh!

1448
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,868
Ahh...

1449
01:36:25,305 --> 01:36:31,536
