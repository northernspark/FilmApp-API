are two entirely different people.

because that was a stupid question.

it will take you away from other things.

00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,475
How'd you get here?

284
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,562
Bus. Then l walked.

00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,150

it was a long ride.

286
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,911
-What brought you here?
-Well, l was kind of thinking

287
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,331
that maybe you could,
you know, show me how to wrestle?

288
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,668
Just... Just sometime.

289
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,255
l mean, l was thinking l'd try out
at 1 35 pounds.

290
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,341
But l don't know much.

291
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,304
-l don't think l'd be much good to you.
-Well, l think l could be good

292
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,891
with the right kind of training.
Just the basics.

293
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,478
in fact, l've been studying it a bit.
About leverage mostly, seems like.

294
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,689
You know,
just getting the right angle and...

295
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,608
l don't know what l'm talking about.

296
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,692
Why do you want to wrestle
all of a sudden?

297
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,363
l don't know.

298
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,531
Cal, l'm just real busy right now.

299
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,121
Coach can teach you the basics.

300
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,083
That's why he's there.

301
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,379
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

302
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,719
Maybe we could...
We could just visit once in a while.

303
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,599
There isn’t... There isn’t much in my life
that you're goanna want to be a part of.

304
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,893
l just thought
'cause we're brothers, maybe...

305
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,228
Not right now.

306
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,966
Hey, Jim.

307
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,760
-Hey. How are you?
-Hey.

308
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,556
-Can l talk to you for a minute?
-Okay.

309
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,601
Cal's not interested in wrestling.

310
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,189
l don't know. He seems eager to learn.

311
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,691
He's looking for Mike.

312
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,778
l've already lost one kid to this sport.
l don't want to go through it again.

313
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,490
Sharon, l doubt the sport had anything
to do with it, one way or the other.

314
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,785
Anyway, it's not really up to me
whether Cal wrestles or not.

315
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,792
There are things about Mike
you don't know. Cal doesn't know.

316
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,420
You know, it turns out
he wasn't as unbreakable

So this brother has something to do
with your wanting to wrestle?

365
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,966
Yeah. Maybe. Why would you ask that?

Just follow your instincts. You'll be fine.

00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,551
How's that brother of yours?

476
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,555
He's, uh,

477
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,182
not really interested.

478
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:07,104
l know a little something about brothers.
l had eight of them.

479
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:11,566
lf you need your brother,
l can promise you that he needs you.

480
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,693
Now, he may not know it
like you know it.

481
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,029
But he does.

482
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,826
Don't give up
on that wrestling thing. Yeah.

483
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,578
l have a good feeling about you.

484
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,600
Hey.

485
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,645
-What are you doing?
-l need to borrow your scooter.

486
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,355
l'll bring it back tonight.

487
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,071
-Are you in trouble?
-No.

488
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,990
l need you to give this note
to Coach Tenant. Promise?

489
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,283
Yeah.

490
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,994
Wow, this is exciting.
l feel like we're eloping.

491
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,203
Yeah, except you isn’t coming.

492
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,291
At least kiss me goodbye.

493
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,210
All right.

494
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,091
-Thank you. l owe you one.
-l'll be collecting, too.

495
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,467
And it won't be on the cheek!

496
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,802
All right.

497
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,055
{Engine Startling}

498
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,658
LAWYER: Your Honour,
my client's altercation with Mr Brock

499
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:47,537
was a reaction to
both physical and verbal taunts.

500
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,665
l believe Mr Charley felt
that he was fighting for his life.

501
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,502
in addition, he has made arrangements
to enter into alcohol rehab

502
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,797
and personal therapy to address
his issues with anger management.

503
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,676
l would ask, at this time,
that the Court allow my client

504
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,679
to pursue this
under the state's supervision.

505
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,932
Thank you, Counsel.

506
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,685
Mr Charley,
anything you care to add, sir?

507
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,024
{Sighs}

508
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,485
Your Honour,
l don't go looking for trouble.

509
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,946
l got put in a situation,

510
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,490
well, l reacted the only way l know how.

511
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,951
You seem to have a history of that,
Mr Charley.

512
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,245
CAL: Your Honour. Ma'am?

513
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,083
Hi. May l say something on his behalf?

514
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,085
Tell the Court your name, please.

515
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,713
Calvin Charley. Mike Charley’s brother.

516
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,716
Step forward. Please.

517
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:53,728
My dad died when l was young.
And my mom works a lot.

518
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,484
But Mike sort of took the place of my dad
after he passed on.

519
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,781
And he teaches me a lot of things
that my mom can't.

520
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:09,744
Your brother is in a lot of trouble.
You do realise that, don't you?

521
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,871
Yes. Yes, ma'am, l do.

522
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,417
But l think that sometimes
guys come after Mike

523
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,961
'cause they see him
as some kind of a target.

524
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:22,090
And he and l have this deal, right,
where l will go out with him

525
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,134
and l'll always step in
if any kind of trouble starts

526
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,177
so he can just walk away.

527
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,766
l just... l wasn't there this time.

528
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,229
Your Honour,
l'm goanna give you my word

529
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,649
that you won't see either one of us
in your courtroom ever again.

530
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,363
l need Mike.

531
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,536
We kind of carry each other.

532
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,792
He's all l got.

533
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,771
-You hungry?
-Yes.

534
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,815
l'm really hungry. Yeah.

535
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,068
What do you want?

536
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,947
l don't know. it’s been a lot of years.

537
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,075
l meant what do you want to eat?

538
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,577
Oh! {CHUCKLES}

539
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,828
Okay. Um...

540
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,830
Sorry, l...

541
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,416
l don't know. l'm kind of having trouble
with my weight.

542
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,710
You know, keeping it down.

543
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,009
Thanks. Actually, l'm starving.

544
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,729
You know, Mike,
l don't want anything from you.

545
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,190
l just want to know you.

546
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,818
Cal, l been alive 28 years.

547
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,862
l just couldn't tell you much
about the last eight or so.

548
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,866
-What happened?
-l don't know.

549
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:15,703
One day Dad was there
and we had a plan. And then...

550
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,833
Well, then he wasn't.

551
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:28,883
Luli? Hey! l was hoping to catch you.

552
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,223
-Hey, Mrs Charley.
-Your old scooter finally quit?

553
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,437
Well, it isn’t been running too good.
That's for sure.

554
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,939
You wouldn't happen to know
where Cal is, would you?

555
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,068
-Wrestling practice, l imagine.
-No.

556
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,905
No. l went by the gym on my way home.

557
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,909
-Hmm?
-Mmm?

558
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,872
Yeah. He got up
awful early this morning.

559
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,665
Too early.

560
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,711
-He does like to study.
-Yes, he does.

561
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,922
And you're not a very good liar, darling.

562
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:11,468
Well, ma'am, l only had two ways to go.

563
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,929
Lie to you
or break a promise to my best friend.

564
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,557
Fair enough. l'm just worried about him.

565
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:20,935
One thing l know about Cal is
he'll be all right.

566
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,937
lf that helps.

567
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,940
Okay. l appreciate that.

568
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:31,279
Come by sometime. We'll do girl things.

569
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,157
l'd like that, ma'am.

570
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,828
So l won the geology essay competition

571
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,956
and used the winnings
to build a catfish farm.

572
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:46,002
it makes me a little bit of money
when l can actually keep it running.

573
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,964
Mostly l just like to go out there
and think.

574
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,008
Mom know you're here?

575
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,971
No. No, she doesn't know l'm here.
So l should probably go.

576
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:03,978
How is she?

577
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,441
She's... She's okay.

578
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,987
l think she wishes she had girls.

579
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,741
She misses you.

580
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,995
Cal, l stayed away

581
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,250
because...

582
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,046
You want me to teach you
how to wrestle?

583
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,554
No. No, Mike, you've got a lot going on.
it’s not that important.

584
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,432
Yes, l would love it
if you'd teach me to wrestle.

585
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,696
-l'll do the best l can.
-Me, too.

586
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,664
{CHUCKLES}

587
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,508
Where have you been?

588
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,053
Nowhere.

589
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,848
Just hanging out with friends.

590
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,085
What is this place?

591
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,213
Church.

592
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,342
You ready?

593
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,094
-Hey!
-Okay.

594
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,555
Three parts to become
a complete wrestler.

595
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,516
Offence, defence, and psychology.

596
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:11,564
We'll talk psychology later.
Today we're goanna work on speed.

597
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,526
Leverage. Knowledge and strength.

598
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,944
Okay.

599
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,988
We're goanna have to build yours.

600
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,114

{SCOFFS}

602
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,123
Oh! He's back. Drinks all around.

603
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,250
What, did you take
a little vacation, Charley?

604
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,127
You wish.

605
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,880
Funny.
No one seemed to notice you missing.

606
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,965
-Why'd you bring it up then?
-Cal, l need you right now.

607
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,259
The rest of you circle up.
Get started on your own.

608
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,553
Hey, circle them up. Let's go.

609
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,314
Cal, we had to forfeit the match
because of you.

610
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:57,360
Now, l give each one of my wrestlers
one shot to save their ass

611
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,154
before l toss them from the team.
This is your shot.

612
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,157
l had to help my brother with something.

613
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,494
Screw up again and you're done.

614
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,287
-Do we understand each other?
-Yes, sir.

615
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,872
All right.
Now get out there with the rest of them.

616
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,165
Thank you, sir.

617
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,795
Lebrowski, l see you.

618
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,338
it’s called a watch. Get one.

619
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,180
Cal, get up.

620
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,142
Back straight. Back straight.
Move with your back straight.

621
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,145
That's where you get your strength.
And when you circle...

622
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,315
Look at my left leg.

623
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,568
Don't take your eyes off it. Look at it.

624
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,195
And when you're ready
to make your move,

625
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,281
halfway through, switch to the right.

626
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,991
Tie me up with the right.

627
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,951
With your right leg on mine,
you keep me from panning out,

628
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,412
-and take me down. You understand?
-Yeah.

629
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,372
Here.

630
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,918
{Grunting}

631
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,714
{Mike Laughing}

632
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,968
So the next time, you actually
shoot for the leg you're looking at.

633
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,847
Or maybe you don't.
Maybe you don't look at all.

634
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,308
You just keep coming and juke it.

635
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,226
Knowledge.

636
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,354
-You learn quick.
-You teach quick.

637
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,856
{Mike Laughing}

638
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:20,610
Hey, l read you once pinned a guy
with a reverse cradle in a close match.

639
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,819
Yeah, reverse cradle.

640
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,238
That's not a move you want to shoot for,

641
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,407
especially against a wrestler
who is any good.

642
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,826
it’s an easy way to get pinned
if you don't know what you're doing.

643
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,246
-How does it work?
-{Laughing} Easy, bud.

644
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,665
Let's learn to walk
before we can run, okay?

645
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,042
Yeah.

646
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,044
Hey, did you get a job yet?

647
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,839
-No.
-l got you one.

648
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,176
Through my geology class.

649
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,636
l know some guys
at Sooner Pipe Works.

650
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,097
They can get you off the rigs, you know.
Put you in a truck.

651
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,349
Servicing the online wells.

652
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,562
Money isn’t bad. it’s pretty steady.

653
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:04,028
-l isn’t out of line about that, am l?
-{Laughing} No. No, l just...

654
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,489
l isn’t used to getting that kind of help.

655
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,998
What was it like working with Dad?

656
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,800
{SOFTLY} l tell you, man. it wasn't work.

657
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,596
it just seemed like Dad always knew
what to do with me.

658
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,307
Yeah.

659
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,728
-You finish your homework?
-Yep.

660
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,147
-Want to do mine?
-No.

661
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,945
{Grunting}

662
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,330
Nice hiney.

663
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,126
Thank you. Speaking of hineys,
my mom wants you to stop by.

664
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,337
-Your mom wants to see my hiney?
-She didn't say.

665
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,300
All right. Tell me about your opponent
for tomorrow.

666
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,472
He's five and five.
l've never seen him before,

667
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,141
but he lost to a kid
who beat me 11 to two.

668
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,976
All right.

669
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,062
You know, Mom's probably
goanna be there tomorrow.

670
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,772
Good.

671
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,108
Are you goanna talk to her?

672
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,072
Cal, l never said anything
about going to meets.

673
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,075
-You understand.
-No, l don't understand.

674
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,453
There's goanna be a lot of folks
in that gym.

675
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,914
They're goanna want to talk to me
about what l've been doing lately.

676
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,376
instead of those trophies
l won ten years ago.

677
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,173
That's including Mom.

678
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,300
Tomorrow's about you.

679
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,718
l'm not going to get in the way
of your match.

680
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,388
-When are you going to talk to Mom?
-{SHARPLY} That's not why we're here.

681
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,391
No, l... l know.

682
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,190
Psychology.

683
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,819
1 29 and a half. Step down, please.

684
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,947
The first time you see your opponent
is the weigh-in.

685
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,823
Official: Next weight class, 135.
Claremore?

686
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,575
Step on, please.

687
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,995
MIKE: Look right through him.
Like he doesn't exist.

688
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,540
it’s a confidence game.

689
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,419
Somehow you are going to instil fear.

690
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,009
Official: 1 34 and a half.
Step down, please.

691
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,928
-Riverdale?
-TENNENT: Charley.

692
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,430
MIKE: You're thinking one thing.

693
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,724
That your girlfriend
is in the front seat of his car,

694
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,435
and if you lose,
she's going home with him.

695
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,230
And you think that over and over again.

696
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,441
You let it burn,
because it will show in your eyes.

697
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,445
TENNENT: Charley.

698
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,157
Step on, please.

699
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,417
You do it right,
sometimes they pee themselves.

700
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,794
-{SCOFFS}
-Yeah.

701
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,463
Mike: There's one more thing.

702
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,424
You got to weigh in naked.

703
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,468
Naked? {Laughing NERVOUSLY}

704
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,097
Well...

705
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:21,892
it’s... Trust me. it’s uncomfortable.
But it makes them more uncomfortable.

706
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,770
Because it shows you're proud
and it shows you've got nothing to fear.

707
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,858
1 35 even. Step down, please.

708
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,985
140?

709
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:36,240
Mike: After that,
you find a spot in that gym.

710
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,492
That's your spot. Your space.

711
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,788
You go there. Bring music with you.

712
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,000
Music you love.
Music that gets into your soul.

713
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,502
You do all those things
and that's going to give you the edge.

714
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,506
Okay.

715
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,467
All right.

716
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:03,309

Riverdale, 12. Claremore, 9.

723
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,974
That was Cal Charley’s first win ever
in a Riverdale uniform.

724
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,977
Let's hear it for our 135-pounder.

for regional’s.

-More time?
-{Laughing} No.

734
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,742
-A better use of the time.
-How?

735
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,787
Well, you've got that week off
for spring break.

736
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:55,416
Eleven days till they start.
That's enough time to get serious.

737
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,336
-Serious?
-{Firmly} Yeah.

738
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,756
Serious enough to show me
the reverse cradle?

{Firmly} No.

{CHUCKLES}

741
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,768
You know, a good friend
wouldn't eat those in front of me.

742
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,980
Don't watch.

743
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,775
So we going to the dance together?

744
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,361
-Might be working.
-What?

745
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,780
Yes, l'm taking you to the dance.

00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,120
l haven't really thought about it yet.

748
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,790
And dare l ask what you're wearing?

749
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,667
it’s a surprise.

750
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:39,793
Well, is it legal?

751
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,545
l'm making it.

752
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,423
Well, that's encouraging.

Luli, you're not still showing the boobs,
are you?

00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,808
You're looking good on that mat, Calvin.

755
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,812
You actually look like
you know what you're doing.

00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,773
Yep.

757
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,403
Can l talk to you for a minute?

758
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,821
it depends
on what you want to talk about.

759
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,366

l'm proud of you for getting out there.

-But?
-But nothing.

00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:20,250

-Okay.
-No matter what.

765
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,804
l'm goanna be there for you.
You got to know that.

766
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:35,474
Just don't let it push you too far, please.

767
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,851
Mom, l'm having fun.

768
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,814
One day when we're older
and sitting in rocking chairs,

769
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:45,526
l want you to describe to me,
in a way l can understand,

770
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,195
how wrestling is fun.

771
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,031
Okay.

772
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,826
Hey.

773
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,745
Practice ends about 4:30
every day, right?

774
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,871
Mmm-hmm.

775
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:01,041
So what exactly do you do
for the next few hours?

776
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:09,007
l just, you know, jog.
Work on the weights. Go to lab.

777
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,093
Okay.

778
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,887
Well, it must be working. You look good.

779
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,564
-Hi!
-Hey.

00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,150
Shit. Howdy! Who are you?

781
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,655
His name's Theo Henderson.
He's a big-time tiny wrestler.

782
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,074
We call him The Gnat.

783
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,744
He's the smallest guy l could find.

784
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,539
-it’s nice to meet you.
-What's up, man?

785
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:43,584
-How much do you weigh?
-About 145.

-Each leg?

The reason the reverse cradle
is such a risk

834

is you got to trick your opponent

come over your shoulder.

You see it come over
for the second time.

You got to grab a headlock.

l mean, l don't even know him
that well, do l?

950
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:21,794
That's not fair, Cal.

951
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,883
l was afraid of you and Mike together.

952
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,385
-Why?
-Mike is

953
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,804
unpredictable.

954
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,391
l became afraid of him. l...

955
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,811
l didn't know how to help him.

956
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:45,610
But you're the best friend l've ever had.

957
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,538
What exactly happened in the car?

958
01:12:58,665 --> 01:12:59,916
{Sighing} Mmm.

959
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:04,837
Your dad and Mike

960
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:12,845
were headed to Eufaula
to scout one of Mike's opponents.

961
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:16,140
That's what they did.
These guys were prepared, Cal.

962
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:22,271
But there was...
There was heavy snow, ice.

963
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,985
Mike was thrown from the car.

964
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,865
Mac wasn't.

965
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,412
l begged them not to go.

966
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:41,999
Dad knew Mike
could take this other kid, but...

967
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:47,880
And he didn't think
they needed to go, but...

968
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,006
But Mike pushed it.

969
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:53,469
l remember him throwing
your dad's words back in his face.

970
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,179
"Take no opponent for granted."

971
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:01,060
So Mac did what he always did.

972
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,230
He kept his word.

973
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,819
Did Mike quit wrestling after that?

974
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,615
No. No. He got hurt a year later. But...

975
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:21,038
He really gave up
the night your dad died.

976
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,668
He blamed himself for Mac's death.

977
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:28,921

{Stifles SOB}

983
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,937
l was so devastated.

984
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,566
And l didn't know it at the time.

985
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:53,946
But l... l blamed him, too.
And Mike felt it.

986
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:56,240
{GROANS}

987
01:14:56,533 --> 01:15:00,953
l was 1 8 when Mike was born.
Your dad and l were just kids.

988
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:03,873
He was my first.
And your first is always your baby.

989
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,709
l mean, you were an adult
when you came out.

990
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:07,960
l had to ask for your lD.

{Chuckling}

992
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:14,258
Then l lost both of them.

Ma, you said

994
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:20,973
that Mike blamed himself

995
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,143
for Dad's being killed?

996
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,146
l mean, did anybody ever tell him
it wasn't his fault?

997
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:35,780
l think everybody in here has a shot
at the medal round this weekend.

Cal.

{Sighing} And he was right.

a guy l dated for about 20 minutes,

ran down the waitress
where you were arrested.

01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:06,869
RED: Like l said,
not all legends are about victory.

1277
01:42:07,579 --> 01:42:09,580
Some are about struggle,

1278
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:13,084
finding out who you are
and your reason for being.

1279
01:42:14,169 --> 01:42:18,923
Big Mac Charley died
before he had a chance to finish the job.

1280
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:20,883
That was his greatest fear,

1281
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:24,595
that Sharon and the boys
would struggle on without him.

1282
01:42:31,770 --> 01:42:33,771
-You got heart, kid.
-Thanks.

1283
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:37,191
-You thought l was done, didn't you?
-Yeah, l did.

1284
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:40,611
RED: He once asked me,
if anything were to happen to him,

1285
01:42:40,612 --> 01:42:43,614
that l might help keep an eye
on the boys.

1286
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:45,741
Mac, your boys are fine.

1287
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:49,642
so is your girl
