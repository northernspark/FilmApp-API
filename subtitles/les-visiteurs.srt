00:00:01,817 --> 00:00:03,568
In the year of Our Lord 1123,

2
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:08,449
King Louis vl, known as "The Fat",
waged war against his cousin,

3
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:12,036
Henry I, King of England
and Duke of Normandy.

4
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:15,372
Many brave knights fought beside him.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,127
They believed in God
and the forces of Evil.

6
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:28,761
Your Majesty,

7
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,387
time is of the essence.

8
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:32,556
Need I remind you
we are in their camp?

9
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:35,809
Silence, Montmirail.
Love knows not haste!

11
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:48,905
Sire Godefroy!

12
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:51,075
The English!

13
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:52,702
My vassal sees

14
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,161
horsemen approaching.

15
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:56,288
We are coming.

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,375
I beg of you, Your Majesty,
make haste!

17
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:03,087
Adieu, my sweet.
I must join my men.

18
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,547
Will I see you soon?

19
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,134
When my cousin,
the King of England, makes amends.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,011
Do you love me, Kathleen?

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,557
Then accord me one last favor,
should I die.

22
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,352
- Hush hush...
- show me your ankles.

23
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,526
I beseech thee, lady-love.

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,658
Higher. Up to your knees.

25
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,624
My God! How beautiful!

26
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:43,168
Sire...

27
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:44,294
they're coming.

28
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:59,100
Come, sire.

29
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,429
THE vlslTORs

30
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:40,601
This way.

31
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,214
King! I capture thee!

32
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:13,341
Let me, my King!

33
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,053
Liar!
The King is never captured.

34
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,514
Not even in chess.

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,771
Toil! Never recoil!

36
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,090
Sound the horns! The King!

37
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,176
Master! You're alive!

38
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,637
God be praised!

39
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:42,264
I managed to save
your horse and your arms.

40
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:44,433
You managed to flee, as usual.

41
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:45,768
Castrated clod!

42
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:47,770
Sire Godefroy,
The King summons you.

43
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,398
Castrated clod!

44
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,232
Sires... the King!

45
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,534
My kind knight Godefroy

46
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,078
merits indeed
his name "The Hardy".

47
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:08,249
His baldrick was nary stuckolded.

48
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:09,625
With his sword,

49
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,836
he yslaked a scurvy English head.

50
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,837
Godefroy Amaury de Malfete,

51
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,632
Count of Montmirail,
of Apremont, and of Popincourt

52
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,925
I shall thus reward your valor.

53
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:21,303
Sire, I am your eternal servant.

54
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,389
I know you desire descendants.

55
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:26,684
You have one week to fetch

56
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:28,894
one of the fairest
Wenches in the Kingdom:

57
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,773
The daughter of the Duke of Puglia.
I know you adore her.

58
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,191
She is yours to wed.

59
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,777
How can I thank thee?

60
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:38,988
To serve my King is my Honor.

61
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,906
Long live the King!

62
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:42,699
Long live the King!

63
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,452
Long live the King!

64
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,662
- Who is he?
- Jacquasse the Crass.

65
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,749
My vassal.
He should be waiting outside.

66
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:54,795
He lacks grace, but he sniffs out
a trail like a good hound.

67
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,385
We must avoid the Forest of Malcombe,
and pass by Montargis.

68
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:02,595
Avoid the forest?

69
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:05,847
You know it's haunted, sire.
No one dares penetrate it.

70
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:06,891
Hogwash!

71
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,767
My betrothed must not wait!

72
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,561
What about the witch of Malcombe?

73
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:13,480
Ride ahead of The Crass.

74
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:32,958
She can turn an army into frog vomit.

75
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,335
At her touch, your skin spits pus.

76
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:37,379
And you pisseth mud.

77
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,465
She can damn 7 generations.

78
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:45,930
We're doomed!

79
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,931
Doomed!

80
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:27,304
Per Ansia

81
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:29,307
Queribus Memorium

82
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,350
"Halt or becometh a slug."

83
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,144
It's Latin and visigoth.

84
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,644
The Devil's drool!

85
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,985
A Black sabbath.
Let's splitteth!

86
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:54,957
What does she want?

87
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,877
To make that old hag
young again. It's impossible!

88
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,921
Drink! Drink!

89
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,231
Where is she?

90
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,776
Fear not.
She'll drop back in.

91
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,284
What a blast to have
a virgin's unpolluted body again!

92
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:31,660
She's plug-ugly!

93
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:34,288
Just like the day I married her!

94
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,291
It's devildom!

95
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:41,878
Surrender, she-Devil!

96
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:05,695
We'll dismember her

97
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,487
and slice out her tongue.

98
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:09,615
Let rats gnaw on her innards.

99
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,161
No lady is tortured on my lands.

100
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,329
Just burn her.

101
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:17,206
Thank you, sire.

102
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,458
Thank you. You are too good!

103
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:24,880
At last... my castle.

104
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,969
Unpack our best apparels

105
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,178
to honor my beloved.

106
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:32,763
Jacquasse, help me change.

107
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:33,639
Yes, sire.

108
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,641
I have no fine apparels.

109
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,518
She won't even see you.

110
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,521
My shoes and my fanciest shell.

111
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:44,566
Ganelon, sound the horn
to announce my arrival.

112
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,908
How thrilled am I, sire Fulbert,

113
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:55,202
that my son weddeth your sweet

114
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:56,703
and gentle daughter.

115
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:59,624
I wanted her to weddeth a Duke,

116
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,001
but our Fat King decided otherwise.

117
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:04,211
Cursed be love.

118
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,340
More wine!
Let me piss a-plenty!

119
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:13,971
Father, you promised
nary to burp for my marriage.

120
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:21,895
The Count of Montmirail!

121
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:27,693
Frenegonde! Where are you going?
Frenegonde! Come back!

122
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,238
Come back this instant!

123
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:33,741
Frenegonde! Come back!

124
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,620
No Duke's daughter runs after

125
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:38,954
a mere Count.

126
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,169
You look good and gentle.

127
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,337
And mighty uncomfortable.

128
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:48,506
Why?

129
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,562
Zounds!
The flask falleth all alone.

130
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:06,106
Give it to me.
My thirst needs a-quenching!

131
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,449
The castle!

132
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,201
Holy scrotums!

133
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,954
It swelleth like a blowfish!

134
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,044
It's wearing a wig!

135
00:11:31,132 --> 00:11:32,883
Sire Godefroy, are you not well?

136
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,766
By what devil-craft?

137
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,977
What's wrong?

138
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,777
Come back, you wicked wench!

139
00:11:53,237 --> 00:11:53,987
Come back!

140
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,282
Come back, you foul slut!

141
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,744
God shield!
A bear is chasing her!

142
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,080
My crossbow!

143
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,625
Come back!

144
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:08,335
There's no bear.

145
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:13,590
Steer clear, beloved!
Steer clear!

146
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,104
Father!

147
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:36,113
I saw a huge beast.

148
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,943
I'll spend my life in a convent,
faithful to you.

149
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:17,613
I can ne'er wed
the man who killed my father.

150
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,158
I understand, my betrothed.

151
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,659
I'll be faithful too.

152
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,662
I shall ne'er marry...

153
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,414
ne'er have descendants.

154
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,458
Don't do me any favors.

155
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:06,995
What are you up to?

156
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:08,997
I Was praying for his salvation.

157
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:10,707
Where is my father's wizard?

158
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,459
Eusaebius?

159
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:22,969
I found him.

160
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,890
He lives yonder,
not far from here.

161
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,724
But they say he's senile.

162
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,145
I can make your Duke live again.

163
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:35,482
But you must know
no fear.

164
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,193
Only God can do that!

165
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:41,280
You are right.
Only God can bring back the dead.

166
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,365
But there is another way.

167
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:48,328
Time is a mountain,
pierced by many hidden tunnels.

168
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:52,207
My magic spells can
give you access to them.

169
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,506
Meet Angueran.

170
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,883
Scarface Angueran.
At your service.

171
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:03,469
And my loyal Ganelon.

172
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:05,762
You shall return

173
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,765
just before the Duke's death.

174
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:12,228
If you find
enough force in yourself...

175
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:15,647
you will be able
to change the course of the arrow.

176
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,524
You'll wed your betrothed,

177
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:20,027
and have the lineage you desire.

178
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,946
It's sheer lunacy!

179
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:25,532
Where is my powder of leech?

180
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,743
I haven't done this in ages.
I'm a bit rusty.

181
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:30,454
He's senile!

182
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:32,873
Here it is.

183
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:37,961
If you fear not,

184
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,089
Godefroy the Hardy, drink.

185
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:46,011
You'll arrive in the forest
just before the accident.

186
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,721
Don't trust the old fool!

187
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,475
If sire Godefroy doesn't return,
We'll lock you in his dungeon

188
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:53,060
With your Book of spells.

189
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,687
Trust me.

190
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:57,731
Don't drink it, sire.
You'll turn into a frog,

191
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,233
or a bat, or a goat,
or a nun's ass.

192
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,069
Perhaps you're right.

193
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,321
Drink first.

194
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,155
Me?

195
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,531
I'll see if you

196
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,075
turn into a nun's ass.

197
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:10,286
If you do, I'll seek revenge.

198
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:11,912
Drink!

199
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,133
So, my Crass?

200
00:16:25,426 --> 00:16:27,386
It tastes like pig excrement.

201
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,140
Candied concoctions
are for evil sorcerers.

202
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:34,977
Drink hastily.
I must say the incantation.

203
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:36,103
If I drank...

204
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:38,063
am I going too?

205
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,404
Say the incantation.

206
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:42,294
They've gone into
the Tunnels of Time!

207
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:49,760
What's that noise?

208
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:50,803
What did you step on?

209
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,305
Rotten eggs.

210
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,599
I forgot the quail eggs.

211
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:59,061
What a catastrophe!

212
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:46,733
Stand up, peasant.

213
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:47,652
Where are We?

214
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:49,528
And our friends?

215
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,988
This isn't my Forest.

216
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,198
The wizard misled us!

217
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:56,493
We have tWo legs, sire.
And tWo arms.

218
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,704
'Tis miracle enough.

219
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:02,249
Fetch me a horse.
Make haste!

220
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:51,048
Pugh! It stinketh!

221
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,561
He's crazy!

222
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:11,235
Sire! A Moor!

223
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,456
A Moor in the Devil's chariot!

224
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:26,792
'Tis metal,
With no oxen to pull it!

225
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,501
Sire, come see!

226
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,801
Thither, sire! Thither!

227
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:40,931
They're psychos.

228
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,517
They're psychos.

229
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,775
Psychos!

230
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:32,065
Whose shield is this?

231
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:35,569
Lord our Father, We have sinned.

232
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,654
We'll bear this ordeal

233
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:39,197
to the end.

234
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,659
Give us the courage never to recoil.

235
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,243
We Will obey Thee.

236
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:45,620
Amen.

237
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:01,262
It stinketh.
We can't breathe! We're doomed!

238
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,221
No, I smell victuals.

239
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:08,102
More diabolic chariots!

240
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:09,812
Let's stay in the Forest.

241
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:10,646
No!

242
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:12,898
We can't fight on an empty belly.

243
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:14,858
Two burgers!

244
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:18,069
French fries and ketchup!

245
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:35,880
Yo guys!

246
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,297
Is it Halloween?

247
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:40,175
You're dressed to go trick or treating!

248
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,676
Silence, strumpet.

249
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:44,305
Take this and go your way.

250
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:47,474
Leave us be.

251
00:22:47,683 --> 00:22:50,102
Holy Moses!

252
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:52,229
Are you Tv stars?

253
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:53,981
Shove off! Shove off!

254
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,358
I don't want to impose,
Ladies and Gents,

255
00:22:56,567 --> 00:23:01,488
but since you're in show-biz,
do you know any... big-time agents?

256
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,784
Quiet, peasant,
or I'll smacketh you.

257
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:08,787
It just so happens
I studied song and dance.

258
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,914
If you could get me an audition,

259
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:12,875
it'd change my life.

260
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,755
What's wrong?
I'm no Worse than Madonna!

261
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:20,758
Let us leave this vile baWd.

262
00:23:22,426 --> 00:23:23,885
Listen...

263
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:39,025
still hanging around, sticky fingers?
Give back the steaks!

264
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,988
Watch out!
I'm a political refugee!

265
00:23:43,197 --> 00:23:45,616
I'm sick of your shenanigans!

266
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:48,160
Ho! Innkeeper!

267
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,120
You hit the fairer sex?

268
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:54,291
What the hell do
these two clowns want?

269
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,126
This isn't a hobo hideout!

270
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,545
I am Godefroy of Montmirail,
Count of Apremont

271
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:01,465
and of Popincourt.
And I lord over my property.

272
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,300
Mr. Vautrot! Help!

273
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:08,889
Call the cops!
The bag lady's bothering Roger again!

274
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:12,267
Murderer!

275
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,354
Come on, toots!
This guy is gun crazy!

276
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:16,730
Attack, sire!

277
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:18,983
On your knees, punk!

278
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,484
Montjoie! St. Denis!

279
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:28,033
Jacquasse! My Jacquasse!

280
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,334
Easy does it, hot stuff.

281
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,502
Attack!

282
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:45,217
Montjoie!

283
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:47,011
Montjoie!

284
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:07,197
Asylum!

285
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:08,073
Asylum!

286
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,077
Father, I beseech
the right to asylum.

287
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,456
Mi... Mi, honey.

288
00:25:15,665 --> 00:25:18,084
That's it.

289
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:21,629
Keep on practicing, love.
I'll be right back.

290
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:26,717
Hello, Countess? It's Father Herve.

291
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:27,843
Hello, Father.

292
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:31,305
Yes, well...
My mass was interrupted...

293
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:35,100
by a hooligan
dressed in a very peculiar way.

294
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:39,146
He claims to be
the Count of Montmirail etc, etc...

295
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:42,107
Quite frankly, he seems off his rocker.

296
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:45,610
The Count of Montmirail?
Daddy died in '81.

297
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,407
I know, Beatrice. I buried him. This one
claims to be called "The Hardy".

298
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,868
He has your family arms on his tunic.

299
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:54,787
Godefroy the Hardy?
How absurd.

300
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,955
Come quickly.

301
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,374
He looks ornery.

302
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:03,211
Hello? Hello?
Father Herve?

303
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,928
What is this?

304
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,639
It's the UNICEF calendar.

305
00:26:18,394 --> 00:26:19,061
Hurry!

306
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:24,691
He's busy praying. He saw today's date
and went into a state of shock.

307
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,277
He claims to be born in 1076.

308
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,946
He's a crackpot.

309
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:34,284
My betrothed.

310
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:37,662
My betrothed.

311
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,582
You are here?

312
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,544
Frenegonde!
My beautiful Frenegonde!

313
00:26:44,754 --> 00:26:46,505
Stop!
That totally hurts!

314
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,507
Calm down, you brute!

315
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:49,341
It is I.

316
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,051
Stop. I don't know you.

317
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:51,969
Frenegonde.

318
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,472
The Countess doesn't know you.

319
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,057
You've made a mistake.

320
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,434
Cease, Father.

321
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:03,021
Dare I understand?

322
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,900
This fair dame is not my beloved,

323
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:09,445
but my descendant.

324
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,326
1000 years betwixt us.

325
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:20,247
Yes. I have to go.
I don't know him from Adam.

326
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,000
I'm from the time of Louis vl.
Help me.

327
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,376
Shall I call for help?

328
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:27,212
No, this very nice man
Won't harm us.

329
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,381
Will 50 francs do?

330
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,550
I must return to my time.

331
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,885
Know'st thou a wizard?

332
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:36,430
No. Sorry, no wizard.
I know the wizard of Oz.

333
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,849
Where is this "Oz"?

334
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:41,977
Don't budge.
We'll take care of you.

335
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:53,489
Thank you, my sweet.

336
00:27:54,323 --> 00:27:55,073
It's a miracle.

337
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:57,326
Okay, call the police.

338
00:27:59,996 --> 00:28:02,289
- It's not very Christian.
- Of course it is.

339
00:28:05,459 --> 00:28:06,501
Pugh! How ugly!

340
00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:09,255
Without them,
We couldn't Watch Tv. Here...

341
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:11,006
Just what the doc ordered.

342
00:28:13,384 --> 00:28:16,136
Thanks, bawd. You're ugly as sin,
but good-hearted.

343
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:17,387
Ever see your nose?

344
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:21,142
When you sneeze,
is it typhoon season?

345
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,769
Your wine is fruity,
but a tad watery.

346
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:26,105
The wine's mine, swine.

347
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:34,196
What a raunchy eater!
You eat the plastic too?

348
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:38,950
The wizard was senile.

349
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,162
If I catch him,
I'll skin him alive.

350
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:43,414
Don't take it so bad.

351
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:45,874
Those pigs always get us.

352
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,751
Is your buddy a wrestler?

353
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:49,211
I saw him on Tv.

354
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,298
I wanted to be a singer...

355
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:54,758
but they're all
full of shit in show-biz.

356
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,761
My sire is a warrior,

357
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,973
a trusted aide of our King.
The Count of Montmirail.

358
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:02,391
Montmirail?

359
00:29:02,642 --> 00:29:04,060
The dentist's old lady?

360
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:05,894
He couldn't marry her!

361
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:07,854
That's why we're here.

362
00:29:08,064 --> 00:29:09,273
They're not married?

363
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,777
No kidding!
The nerve of that prude!

364
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,654
She acts so holier-than-thou
at the rummage sale.

365
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:16,613
What a bitch!

366
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:22,703
You came so fast.

367
00:29:22,912 --> 00:29:25,581
Squadron sergeant-Major Gibon.
At your service, Countess.

368
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,541
I brought the National Guard.

369
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,834
Where's the offender?

370
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:31,253
My stars!
Your squadron is quite impressive.

371
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:34,423
He's a bit brutal, but he's just
a poor homeless person.

372
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:35,841
They're back-up.

373
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,718
This is Doctor Bauvin.

374
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,764
First we'll talk to him.
Size up the beast.

375
00:29:41,973 --> 00:29:44,892
Let's go, Bauvin.

376
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,228
Good luck!

377
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:56,112
Where is she?

378
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,447
Enough!
Identity papers! Green card!

379
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,532
Psychology, sergeant-Major.

380
00:30:00,741 --> 00:30:02,993
Hello there.
Are you from around here?

381
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:04,578
Bow down before me,

382
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:05,913
and I shall be clement.

383
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:08,541
Why the costume?
Are you an actor?

384
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:09,708
Is this for Tv?

385
00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:13,920
Candid Camera?
Should I smile?

386
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:16,465
Where is my descendant?
Answer or die!

387
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:19,468
Let me, sergeant-Major.
He's a sicko!

388
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:22,638
A little shot
and you'll be good as new.

389
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:24,974
Give me your arm.

390
00:30:32,189 --> 00:30:35,358
Officer, send in
your men on the double!

391
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:38,320
He's a maniac!
He took the doctor hostage!

392
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:57,214
Thanks for coming!

393
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:06,265
Montjoie! St. Denis!

394
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:12,354
Toil, toil! Never recoil!

395
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:23,365
I have a horrible doubt. This tramp
just may be part of my family.

396
00:31:23,574 --> 00:31:24,199
What?

397
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:26,910
"Montjoie" is the battle cry
of French knights.

398
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:32,749
"Toil! Never recoil!"
Is the motto of Godefroy the Hardy.

399
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,460
It's my family's motto.

400
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:36,420
Now you have doubts?

401
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,421
He's calmed doWn.

402
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:41,842
Hold him down.
I'll put him to sleep.

403
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,687
No, my mistake!
I never saw him before.

404
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,190
It can't hurt.
I killed the nerve.

405
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:57,733
Jean-Pierre, come here.

406
00:31:57,942 --> 00:31:58,984
Excuse me, ma'am.

407
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:00,777
I'll just be a minute.

408
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:04,698
Do you remember my cousin Hubert?

409
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:06,617
Martha's son. Naval Academy.

410
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:08,869
The race car driver?
I never met him.

411
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:12,247
Obviously. He disappeared
in Borneo before our marriage.

412
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:14,082
- I think he's alive.
- What?

413
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:16,752
As wacky as it sounds,
today's Tarzan...

414
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:19,088
is probably Hubert.
He's totally changed.

415
00:32:19,297 --> 00:32:20,631
You said he was a bum.

416
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,299
He had family air.

417
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:25,469
The sensual nose,
the large forehead...

418
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,931
You meet a derelict
With a shiny red schnozz, and noW...

419
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,933
he's a long-lost sensual cousin!

420
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:32,685
A cousin with our arms!

421
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:34,811
Don't just stand there.
Come look.

422
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:39,441
Look. The Montmirail family album.

423
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:42,194
Here's our first Count,
Godefroy The Hardy.

424
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:44,238
It's the same nose and forehead.

425
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:47,575
That's a 900-year old drawing.
What's the link with Hubert?

426
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:50,702
I'll call the castle.
When Hubert was 19,

427
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:53,122
he posed for the last
family portrait.

428
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:54,749
A wild-goose chase!

429
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,967
Beatrice Goulard de Montmirail
for Mr. Jacquart.

430
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:08,596
Hello, Countess. It's Frederick.

431
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,347
Fred, is Jacques-Henri there?

432
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,809
One minute. A word of warning:
He's repairing the boiler.

433
00:33:14,018 --> 00:33:14,893
He's on edge.

434
00:33:15,102 --> 00:33:15,852
Jacques-Henri!

435
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:19,148
Why did you jerk
the lever so violently?

436
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:20,483
You asked me to.

437
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:21,983
Spare me.

438
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:24,486
My stunning vest
is now a filthy rag.

439
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:25,987
Jacques-Henri!

440
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:27,990
Why are you shouting?

441
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:29,283
Beatrice de Montmirail.

442
00:33:29,492 --> 00:33:31,035
What a ball-buster.

443
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:32,119
Jacquart?

444
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:33,454
Jacquart?

445
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:34,288
Yes?

446
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:35,831
Boiler trouble?

447
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,249
The burner is ruined.

448
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,418
Jean-Francois yanked on the lever.

449
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:40,794
Oil spurt out.

450
00:33:41,003 --> 00:33:43,922
I was nearly disfigured.
Not to mention my jacket.

451
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:46,133
No one is of any help.

452
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:48,677
At least no one died.

453
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:49,887
Thank God.

454
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:51,097
I have a problem too.

455
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:52,681
Can I ask you a favor?

456
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,603
Go upstairs to the Gallery.
In our last family portrait...

457
00:33:57,812 --> 00:34:00,022
there's a Royal Navy cadet.

458
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:03,901
Second row. The kepi with a feather.
Do you have a Pola?

459
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,735
A what?

460
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:08,238
A Polaroid, Jacques.
The children threw ours in the toilet.

461
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,700
We have no "Pola". And my name
is Jacques-Henri, not Jacques.

462
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,538
Try to understand, Jacquart/
my cousin is in an insane asylum

463
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:17,664
by accident.

464
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:19,332
I can't help your cousin.

465
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:20,334
We're busy.

466
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:24,838
The Bernay and Bernay Bank
is here for a seminar.

467
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:27,257
Edgar Bernay will be
bathing in cold water.

468
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:30,719
So, even if I had a "Pola",
I wouldn't take your picture.

469
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,097
Okay, I'll hang up.
I'll deal with this myself.

470
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:35,266
Toodle-oo.

471
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,143
Good riddance.

472
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:40,563
Sir...

473
00:34:40,771 --> 00:34:41,396
Yes.

474
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:44,900
The rooms are horribly humid.
Mr. Bernay is sneezing non-stop.

475
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:48,070
He wanted to relax
after his speech on sponsoring.

476
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,739
So he took a shower.

477
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:50,614
Ice-cold.

478
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,199
His head is full of shampoo.

479
00:34:52,408 --> 00:34:54,701
If you can't get the hot water back,

480
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:56,913
We'll have to cut short the seminar.

481
00:34:58,205 --> 00:34:59,664
Does the Instamatic work?

482
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:02,001
I'm draining Mrs. Pelissier's molar.

483
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:03,753
It'll be fine.

484
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,588
This is the Montmirail's house.

485
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:14,221
Take it easy!

486
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:18,601
They'll bawl us out. Stop!

487
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:20,894
They'll call the cops
for noise pollution.

488
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,896
Try ringing the bell.

489
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:29,778
Knock it off!
They'll kick us out!

490
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,665
Jacquart,
Why are you dressed like that?

491
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:44,460
Excuse our excessive chiming,

492
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,003
your Grace...

493
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:47,213
Lady Frenegonde!

494
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:49,881
Let me go! You're crazy!

495
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,927
She's my mistress!

496
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:54,845
What?

497
00:35:55,054 --> 00:35:56,722
Jean-Pierre, come here.

498
00:35:56,931 --> 00:35:59,141
Jacquart is calling me
"Frenegonde" too.

499
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,268
You slept with her?
Don't worry.

500
00:36:01,978 --> 00:36:04,897
He looks weird but he's pals
With Montmirail the stuntman.

501
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:06,732
Montmirail the stuntman?

502
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:09,902
You must mean Hubert,
the race car driver.

503
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:11,236
Stuntman, wrestler...

504
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:12,362
race car driver...

505
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:13,489
same diff.

506
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:14,824
But who are you?

507
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:19,078
Jacquasse The Crass.
You don't recognizeth me?

508
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:22,331
No, I don't recognizeth you.
You're Hubert's friend?

509
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,583
Hubert de Montmirail, whatta hunk.

510
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:26,210
And so considerate...

511
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,379
like you, your Ladyship.

512
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,590
And he gallops
like Kerwin Costnere.

513
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:33,967
Coward that I am,
I lost track of my sire

514
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,968
at the inn.

515
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:36,428
They got in a brawl

516
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:38,347
at Remi vautrot's pit stop.

517
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:39,557
Whip me...

518
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:41,391
your Ladyship!

519
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:44,645
What is it?

520
00:36:46,564 --> 00:36:48,357
- Jacquart?
- Thou know'st me?

521
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:49,275
What?

522
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:50,609
A Jacquart from hunger.

523
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:51,568
I'm lost.

524
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:52,527
Mr. Goulard...

525
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:53,779
Yes, hello...

526
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:55,197
He's a friend

527
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:57,241
of Hubert's. According to her,

528
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,536
Hubert has become
a stuntman and a wrestler.

529
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:03,247
What horrible teeth!
Let's have a look.

530
00:37:06,459 --> 00:37:07,877
I'm no mule! Zounds!

531
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:10,337
That ass bit me!
I need a tetanus shot!

532
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:12,422
He might even have rabies!

533
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:15,259
It isn't Jacquart.
I did his bridge-work.

534
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:17,553
Obviously, Jean-Pierre.

535
00:37:17,762 --> 00:37:19,638
He proves that Hubert is alive.

536
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:22,474
We have to get him
out of the hospital.

537
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,184
You banged the Countess?

538
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:26,979
Bitch.

539
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:30,524
The bum can't come.
My car isn't Noah's ark.

540
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:34,153
Open the window.

541
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:36,238
His body odor is unbearable.

542
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,449
He's very, very green.

543
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,953
Stop the car.
He's going to vomit.

544
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:44,204
Wait a second!

545
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:45,455
Hold it in!

546
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:49,335
It's coming!

547
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:56,842
He got it all over.

548
00:37:57,134 --> 00:37:59,052
What a pig!
He puked on my shoes!

549
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:03,724
Your cousin is very violent.
He nearly castrated me.

550
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:06,143
Castrated clod!

551
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:07,186
What?

552
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,521
He saved our King's life.

553
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,480
What?

554
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,649
Ah, my youngling.

555
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:13,901
Why did you abandon me?

556
00:38:15,528 --> 00:38:16,695
Their little red balls

557
00:38:16,904 --> 00:38:17,821
made me sleep.

558
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,740
Master! Master!

559
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:23,035
Why are you bound?
How much is the ransom?

560
00:38:23,244 --> 00:38:24,495
Silence, peasant!

561
00:38:24,704 --> 00:38:26,789
The "little red balls" are valium.

562
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,874
50 milligrams. He barely slept.

563
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:34,088
Apothecary, I demand
to be released immediately.

564
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:35,464
Calm down.

565
00:38:36,674 --> 00:38:40,719
I am neither sick nor loony.
I come from far, far away.

566
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:41,970
Yes.

567
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:45,265
He thinks no one
understands who he is.

568
00:38:45,516 --> 00:38:46,934
Persecution mania.

569
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:50,896
But it's true. He came from Borneo.
He had an accident during a rally.

570
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:52,815
Right, cousin Hubert?

571
00:38:53,149 --> 00:38:53,858
Cousin Hubert?

572
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,901
Yes. Hubert de Montmirail.

573
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:59,071
It's freaky...
he has my father's hands.

574
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,073
You know your name.

575
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,576
He knows nothing.
He's completely amnesiac.

576
00:39:04,785 --> 00:39:06,578
He says he's never watched Tv.

577
00:39:06,787 --> 00:39:08,622
Amnesiac? How tragic!

578
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:22,511
His last remaining memories are

579
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,513
a few facts from History class.

580
00:39:24,722 --> 00:39:25,723
Elementary stuff.

581
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:28,016
It's often the case with amnesiacs.

582
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:32,354
He speaks a hodgepodge
of Latin and Old French.

583
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,273
Verbal diarrhea.

584
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:35,691
Let him go.

585
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,735
- Pawing at him won't help!
- Compose yourself.

586
00:39:40,154 --> 00:39:41,196
Will you free him?

587
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,157
Yes, only because
your husband is a doctor,

588
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:45,701
and he agrees to take

589
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,869
full responsibility.

590
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:48,746
Another relative of yours?

591
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:50,664
No, not at all.

592
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:52,541
An old friend of Hubert's.

593
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,042
I belong to the Count.

594
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:56,128
Souplette, sire?

595
00:39:56,337 --> 00:39:59,465
Is he a foreigner?
I don't understand him.

596
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:02,009
Yes, that must be it.
Come, cousin...

597
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:08,849
Wait! If you take him,
take his outfit too.

598
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:11,894
It smells like a billy goat here.
It's repulsive.

599
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:18,693
Here, take the valium.

600
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:21,528
If he gets violent,
give him five of them.

601
00:40:21,862 --> 00:40:22,946
Thank you.

602
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:27,993
Two more lunatics roaming the streets.

603
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,494
Sit down here.

604
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:32,039
Take care of him. I'll get the car.

605
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,627
Lady Frenegonde is strange.

606
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:40,339
She is not Lady Frenegonde.
She's my descendant.

607
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,009
My great great great
great great great granddaughter.

608
00:40:44,552 --> 00:40:46,720
Your great great
great great granddaughter?

609
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:49,139
How terrible!

610
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:52,976
My Crass, we're a 1000 years old.
It's a living hell.

611
00:40:55,855 --> 00:40:57,773
We must search the dungeon.

612
00:40:57,982 --> 00:41:00,693
Angueran swore to lock up
the wizard and his Book.

613
00:41:00,902 --> 00:41:04,447
With the book, We can concoct
the potion and go back in Time.

614
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:06,949
Drink that again? Pugh!

615
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,243
You'd rather stay here?

616
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,539
Oh no!

617
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,213
Is this too fast, Hubert?

618
00:41:21,422 --> 00:41:22,673
Do you feel sick?

619
00:41:22,882 --> 00:41:25,843
Open your eyes, sire Godefroy.
You'll get used to it.

620
00:41:26,677 --> 00:41:28,595
Why "Godefroy" and not "Hubert"?

621
00:41:28,804 --> 00:41:30,222
Jean-Pierre, he has amnesia.

622
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:32,224
Godefroy, Henri, suzy...

623
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:36,019
Wait. Who has amnesia?
Your cousin or that other skunk?

624
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,146
They both do, Jean-Pierre.

625
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:40,232
Try being more tolerant.

626
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:49,366
Their feet reek! It's revolting!

627
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:51,285
What an insufferable ride!

628
00:41:51,494 --> 00:41:54,330
Please...
I didn't smell anything unusual.

629
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:00,586
Did the kids behave?

630
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:02,671
- Yes.
- Okay, toodle-oo!

631
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,716
Zounds! What happened to Nature?

632
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,552
Everything is ugly.
There's no room...

633
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:10,304
to go hunting.

634
00:42:10,513 --> 00:42:12,890
The air is heavy.
It stinketh!

635
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:14,058
I'll say!

636
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:16,644
And it'll be worse
With the new highway.

637
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:19,563
Good-bye, Dr. Goulard.

638
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:21,023
Here you go.

639
00:42:21,357 --> 00:42:23,484
It smells gross. Yeeuck!

640
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,902
Like old socks.

641
00:42:26,112 --> 00:42:26,987
Could be.

642
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:28,530
See you tomorrow, Hilda.

643
00:42:31,576 --> 00:42:32,702
Where is my castle?

644
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,453
We left the castle ages ago.

645
00:42:34,662 --> 00:42:35,537
Unfortunately.

646
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:37,998
Can you imagine the heating bills?

647
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,459
Anyway, Hubert,
make yourself at home here.

648
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:42,002
I must go to the castle.

649
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:43,253
Yes! Yes!

650
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:45,547
That'll be tomorrow's outing!

651
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:48,550
Count me out.
I'm over-booked already.

652
00:42:48,884 --> 00:42:49,676
Dinnertime!

653
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:52,096
Yes! Souplette! Good hot souplette!

654
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:55,516
Yes, Mr... Jacques Kass.
I'll make you some.

655
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:00,688
He loves soup.

656
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,070
You live in a pitiful dwelling.

657
00:43:08,362 --> 00:43:09,738
'Tis for peasants.

658
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:11,907
True, our home is simple.

659
00:43:12,116 --> 00:43:15,452
But it's cozy and has lent itself
to some marvelous evenings.

660
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:16,453
Don't push it.

661
00:43:16,913 --> 00:43:19,165
We weren't counting
on having houseguests.

662
00:43:19,373 --> 00:43:20,791
So go easy on us, Hubert.

663
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,251
You're Cousin Hubert?

664
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,420
O! Noble Cousin Hubert!

665
00:43:24,962 --> 00:43:26,922
Now he's calling me Hubert!

666
00:43:27,506 --> 00:43:28,757
They're both crazy!

667
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:31,802
Listen, peon.

668
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,345
I'm Cousin Hubert.

669
00:43:33,554 --> 00:43:34,805
You, sire?

670
00:43:35,014 --> 00:43:37,933
I don't want
to go back to the loonies.

671
00:43:38,142 --> 00:43:40,060
Call me "Cousin Hubert"...

672
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:42,396
and never "sire". Understand?

673
00:43:42,897 --> 00:43:43,689
Yes, sire.

674
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,569
Stop that, or I'll give you
the little red balls.

675
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,281
Leg of lamb, my sire!

676
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:54,617
Why "my sire" now?

677
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:57,410
I don't know, Jean-Pierre.
I just don't know.

678
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:00,747
Mr... Kass,
that's for tomorrow.

679
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:03,501
Tonight is cold roast beef
and a salad...

680
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:05,043
and a Cup-a-soup for you.

681
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:07,880
If you're still hungry,
you can have some left-overs.

682
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:09,757
Then a shower and off to bed.

683
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:13,135
Maybe they can start with the shower.
After such a trying day...

684
00:44:13,344 --> 00:44:14,803
they'll want to wash up.

685
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:15,887
No servants?

686
00:44:17,556 --> 00:44:19,891
Come wash your hands.

687
00:45:05,146 --> 00:45:06,105
Bea, come look.

688
00:45:06,314 --> 00:45:07,023
What is it?

689
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:08,148
Come look!

690
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:09,608
What?

691
00:45:11,861 --> 00:45:13,988
Cousin Hubert, What are you doing?

692
00:45:14,196 --> 00:45:16,072
Can amnesia be this serious?

693
00:45:16,282 --> 00:45:17,741
They're boors!

694
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,409
Swimming in the toilet!

695
00:45:21,037 --> 00:45:21,829
Water.

696
00:45:22,997 --> 00:45:23,706
Soap.

697
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,416
Hot.

698
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,418
Cold. Okay?

699
00:45:27,752 --> 00:45:29,420
Thank you, gentle Lady.

700
00:45:30,713 --> 00:45:32,256
Gentle lady...

701
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:36,177
sire Godefroy.

702
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,388
Cousin Hubert!

703
00:45:39,597 --> 00:45:41,599
Lady Frenegonde is
1000 years old too?

704
00:45:42,224 --> 00:45:44,267
She's not Lady Frenegonde.

705
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:45,853
She's Lady Beatrice.

706
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:48,314
How often must I tell you?

707
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:50,774
Lady Beatrice.

708
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:53,985
The descendant.

709
00:45:58,074 --> 00:45:59,992
Jean-Pierre, set the table.

710
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:00,993
The nice plates

711
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:02,077
or the normal ones?

712
00:46:02,286 --> 00:46:04,121
Jean-Pierre, use mother's service.

713
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:04,997
Ridiculous.

714
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:09,627
Here. Help me, you two.

715
00:46:16,384 --> 00:46:18,511
You stupid idiots!

716
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:21,847
Bea, they're retarded!
They can't even set a table!

717
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:26,018
Hello!

718
00:46:26,602 --> 00:46:29,187
Don't scream.
It's Jacquart. I'm not deaf.

719
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:32,607
I'm sorry, Jacques-Henri.
Bea has some family over.

720
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:34,318
It's not easy.

721
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:37,238
Sorry to bother you.
I'm here with President Bernay

722
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,532
the younger of the two
banking brothers.

723
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,449
A charming man.

724
00:46:41,158 --> 00:46:44,244
Unfortunately,
he has a festering abscess.

725
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,455
Due to the humidity in your hotel,

726
00:46:46,664 --> 00:46:48,832
or your "Royal Raspberry" sherbet.

727
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,918
His face is all bloated.

728
00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:02,846
I'll see your friend Bernie
tomorrow at 8:00.

729
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:05,182
It's Bernay, not Bernie.

730
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:08,852
Lady-love...

731
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:11,354
your skin is as soft as a rose petal.

732
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:14,608
Hubert!

733
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:21,365
How exciting to touch you...

734
00:47:21,574 --> 00:47:22,658
to lay beside you.

735
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:24,869
Who does he want to lay?

736
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:32,751
Jean-Pierre, you're totally on time.
Let's clean up.

737
00:47:34,003 --> 00:47:35,337
What were you up to?

738
00:47:35,546 --> 00:47:36,880
You're kissing cousins!

739
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:38,340
- Not at all!
- Sorry!

740
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:02,531
He'll take him.

741
00:48:02,782 --> 00:48:03,783
He's too bad off.

742
00:48:04,283 --> 00:48:05,075
Hello?

743
00:48:05,284 --> 00:48:06,493
What the shit?

744
00:48:07,328 --> 00:48:08,037
Shit.

745
00:48:08,371 --> 00:48:10,706
Hello, Jean-Pierre?
Is that Jean-Pierre?

746
00:48:14,877 --> 00:48:15,794
What the hell?

747
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:19,089
You were sweethearts.

748
00:48:19,298 --> 00:48:21,758
Not at all. He was much older!

749
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:24,095
You won't admit
you were flirting.

750
00:48:24,303 --> 00:48:28,307
Jean-Pierre, control yourself!
What you're saying is totally offensive.

751
00:48:28,724 --> 00:48:30,225
Is this my castle?

752
00:48:30,434 --> 00:48:31,184
Yes it is.

753
00:48:31,394 --> 00:48:33,521
Where's my watch-tower? My moat?

754
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:35,105
My draw-bridge?

755
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:37,691
Is my dungeon intact?

756
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:40,235
He doesn't even recognize
your castle.

757
00:48:40,444 --> 00:48:43,029
Hub, it was rebuilt
after the Revolution.

758
00:48:43,239 --> 00:48:44,031
The what?

759
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:45,574
Christ Almighty.

760
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:48,411
I must go in my dungeon.

761
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:51,454
Relax. You're hysterical, Hub.

762
00:48:51,664 --> 00:48:54,333
We'll go tomorrow.
But the dungeon is a legend.

763
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:56,877
Father always thought one existed...

764
00:48:57,086 --> 00:48:59,213
but we never found it.

765
00:49:05,886 --> 00:49:07,804
It's like someone imitating a dog.

766
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:10,432
Listen. It's strange.

767
00:49:16,147 --> 00:49:17,523
I don't hear a thing.

768
00:49:17,732 --> 00:49:18,441
President Bernay.

769
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:28,284
Now he's gone too far!

770
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:31,036
He better not have woken
Florian and Ondine.

771
00:49:33,414 --> 00:49:36,875
No! Bea! He burnt
your umbrell-Ahhhhh!

772
00:49:37,793 --> 00:49:38,710
Umbrella.

773
00:49:39,003 --> 00:49:40,295
In the hole.

774
00:49:40,671 --> 00:49:41,797
These eardrops sting.

775
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:43,924
The dog never complained.

776
00:49:44,634 --> 00:49:47,178
If President Bernay has lost...

777
00:49:47,386 --> 00:49:50,013
just one percent of his hearing,

778
00:49:50,431 --> 00:49:52,808
We'll sue the pants off you.

779
00:49:53,392 --> 00:49:54,726
I've gone deaf.

780
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:58,814
I'm a little confused...
You're a race car driver?

781
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:02,234
A boxer? A stuntman?

782
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:03,777
A movie actor?

783
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:08,115
Who's the star of the movie?

784
00:50:08,324 --> 00:50:10,284
Do I know him? And the director?

785
00:50:11,953 --> 00:50:14,830
Stop the interrogation.
You're exhausting them.

786
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:16,707
Can't we talk?

787
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:17,958
Am I boring you?

788
00:50:18,626 --> 00:50:19,501
Ay, indeed.

789
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:20,544
Charming.

790
00:50:20,753 --> 00:50:21,545
You see.

791
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,631
Will this last long?

792
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:24,798
Day...

793
00:50:25,007 --> 00:50:25,924
Night...

794
00:50:31,931 --> 00:50:34,892
Please, Mr. Kass,
that's becoming rather grating.

795
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:37,728
Can't he join us?
It's embarrassing.

796
00:50:37,937 --> 00:50:39,813
He ne'er eats amid nobility.

797
00:50:40,022 --> 00:50:42,315
He is happy to munch
our left-o'ers.

798
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:43,526
Here, boy.

799
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,402
Thank you, sire Hubert!

800
00:50:45,611 --> 00:50:48,071
He's mashing potatoes into the rug!

801
00:50:48,281 --> 00:50:50,074
Enough! Come sit here.

802
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:52,576
That would upset him,
right Jacquasse?

803
00:50:52,785 --> 00:50:54,119
You want to sit here?

804
00:50:54,328 --> 00:50:56,163
No, sire Hubert.

805
00:50:56,372 --> 00:50:58,832
In my house, we all eat together.

806
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,584
Nay! Nay!

807
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:01,835
Obey, peasant.

808
00:51:02,044 --> 00:51:03,211
Your host insists.

809
