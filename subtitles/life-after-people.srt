1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,989
What would happen

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:08,406
if every human being on Earth disappeared?

00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:19,128
At some point in the future,

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,304
this could be the fate of our planet

6
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:28,090
This isn't the story of how we might vanish

7
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:32,536
It is the story of what happens

8
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:35,750
to the world we leave behind.

9
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:58,619
The disappearance of humans

10
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:02,104
may seem like science fiction,

11
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:02,541
but eventually,

12
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:07,183
there will come a day like this;

13
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:10,195
a day when people no longer walk the Earth

14
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:17,269
It's no great stretch

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,972
to imagine humans disappearing

16
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,375
from the face of the Earth.

17
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,077
Every generation has its tales

18
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,514
of Armageddon or Apocalypse.

19
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:26,785
We're the first generation

20
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,446
that could,

21
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:28,949
by deliberate actions,

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,992
cause its own doom.

23
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,509
What will life be like after people?

24
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:44,529
We're tantalized by our myths

25
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:48,520
about our own destruction,

26
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,522
but also tantalized

27
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:50,520
by the notion,

28
00:01:50,555 --> 00:01:54,631
"Hey, maybe it's the turn of someone else."

29
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:55,662
What will they do

30
00:01:55,663 --> 00:02:01,472
if we're gone?

31
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:02,244
What will the Earth do

32
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:06,009
when i'm gone?

33
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,864
It's the most natural question in the world

34
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:31,351
Time has run out for man.

35
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:36,600
Our hold on the planet is over.

36
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:50,272
Welcome to Earth,

37
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:57,834
population zero.

38
00:02:57,835 --> 00:03:00,900
Within hours after we're gone,

39
00:03:00,935 --> 00:03:02,041
lights start going out

40
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:09,017
around the world.

41
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:10,955
More than 70 percent of power

42
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:12,357
in the United States

43
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,520
is generated by the burning

44
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:17,792
of fossil fuels.

45
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:19,669
The plant will only continue

46
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,821
to produce electricity

47
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:21,973
as long as the fuel

48
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:25,840
takes to be consumed.

49
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,082
If there's no one around

50
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,815
to provide the new fuel

51
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,370
into the generating plant,

52
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:31,890
then it'll be quite quick

53
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:34,059
before the lights

54
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:35,125
start going out in cities

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,332
all over the world.

56
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:40,333
Nuclear power plants

57
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:43,308
are unlikely to melt down.

58
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:44,240
The average reactor

59
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,136
holds enough fuel

60
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:47,975
to keep running for two years.

61
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:48,947
But without humans

62
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:50,716
consuming the power

63
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,449
generated by the plant,

64
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:54,126
the reactors will automatically

65
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,191
shut down into a safe mode

66
00:03:57,192 --> 00:04:01,499
in as little as two days.

67
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:03,338
Even wind generation

68
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,143
can't last forever.

69
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,407
The turbines require bearings

70
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:09,051
and lubrication of those bearings

71
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:11,201
in order to keep operating.

72
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:13,317
If there's no one around

73
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,957
to maintain the turbines,

74
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:20,469
the electricity doesn't get produced

75
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,174
As generating plants go down,

76
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,705
outages on the power grid

77
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:29,083
contribute to a cascade of failure worldwide

78
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:31,868
After a few weeks,

79
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:33,277
the planet is plunged

80
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:34,652
into a deep darkness.

81
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,024
It has not experienced

82
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:40,963
since humans first huddled around campfires

83
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,811
Perhaps, the last glow of
artificial lights on Earth

84
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:50,649
will be seen in the American Southwest

85
00:04:53,183 --> 00:04:55,025
Here, the mighty Hoover dam

86
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:56,277
hydropower plant

87
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:57,529
takes little notice

88
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,537
of the absence of humans.

89
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:02,563
Its source of fuel

90
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,571
is virtually limitless.

91
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:05,973
At Hoover dam,

92
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,145
our fuel supply

93
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:08,573
is actually the water

94
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,551
in the reservoir in lake Mead

95
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:14,516
behind Hoover dam,

96
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:15,920
so as long as there's water

97
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:16,991
in the reservoir,

98
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:20,046
this power plant

99
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:23,101
can keep running.

100
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:24,334
There's water in the reservoir

101
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:25,705
keeps supplying the water

102
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:30,914
to the hydro turbine generators.

103
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:31,750
These generators

104
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:34,018
are operating automatically

105
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,251
and that would continue

106
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,141
as long as all of the systems

107
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:41,030
are functioning normally.

108
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:43,805
If I and my staff

109
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:45,173
were to leave tonight

110
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:49,214
and not come back to Hoover dam,

111
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,834
say just in the condition

112
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:52,419
of the plant is in right now,

113
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,581
this would continue operating

114
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:56,385
without us here.

115
00:05:56,387 --> 00:05:57,257
That would still be true

116
00:05:57,292 --> 00:06:00,862
after about a week,

117
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:05,099
several weeks, several months,

118
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,171
maybe even a couple of years,

119
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,143
everything would still be

120
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:11,009
running normally.

121
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,381
In a life after people,

122
00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:14,155
it is possible that Hoover dam

123
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,715
would be one

124
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:15,657
of the last power plants

125
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:22,127
still running.

126
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,269
As the power goes out

127
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,503
around the world,

128
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:26,640
other systems

129
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:31,413
are quickly beginning to fail.

130
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:33,115
Beneath all the major cities,

131
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:34,984
there's a complex network

132
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,205
of underground tunnels,

133
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,392
and these are there

134
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:39,125
for drainage purposes

135
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,458
or for cabling purposes,

136
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:41,098
and in the case

137
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,096
of the big cities,

138
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:49,072
for transportation as well.

139
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:50,244
There are many of those

140
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,415
sit below the level

141
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,784
of the water table,

142
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,852
and in order to keep them dry,

143
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:56,654
we have to have

144
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:57,556
a system of pumps

145
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,457
that are switched on

146
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,554
when necessary

147
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,343
to drain the tunnels.

148
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:05,098
Deep within New York

149
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,465
city subways,

150
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,802
more than 700 pumps

151
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,705
constantly struggle to keep out

152
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:12,275
a flood of ground water,

153
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,182
an average of 13 million gallons

154
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:18,184
a day.

155
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:19,290
Now, if all these people

156
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,523
were not around,

157
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,026
there will be nobody

158
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:23,528
to switch the pumps on.

159
00:07:23,563 --> 00:07:24,229
It's estimated,

160
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,618
that the tunnels will fill

161
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:29,006
with water in about 36 hours.

162
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,104
Back above ground,

163
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:45,930
food is rotting

164
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:58,625
on supermarket shelves.

165
00:07:58,626 --> 00:07:59,527
Home refrigerators

166
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,393
become nothing more

167
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:03,933
than cabinets for decaying food,

168
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:04,935
but melt water

169
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:06,768
from defrosting freezers

170
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,843
may provide a temporary lifeline

171
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:10,244
for some of the creatures

172
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,080
we've left behind.

173
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,082
What will be the fate

174
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,449
of our family pets

175
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:18,086
once there are no humans left

176
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:19,719
to care for them?

177
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,572
Right from the get-go,

178
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,425
there's gonna be a massive

179
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:26,400
die off of dogs.

180
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,773
The instance that humans

181
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:28,173
are gone,

182
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,640
they're not creating the debris

183
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:33,708
or producing the food

184
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:42,196
that the dogs are living on.

185
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:43,459
He can't open cans,

186
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:44,029
he can't get

187
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,965
in the refrigerator.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,505
They gotta get

189
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,489
out of the house.

190
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,437
The family dog

191
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,346
has gotta get out of the house

192
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:57,066
or he's gonna die there.

193
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,785
And once he gets out,

194
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,486
he's got to go

195
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:09,441
to some source of food.

196
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:10,423
The first thing that happens

197
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,404
is that they all jump out

198
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,175
of the windows

199
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,647
and they are now out there

200
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,175
in a new landscape.

201
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,012
And the first to whack at it

202
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:19,357
it is that they go back

203
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,190
to scavenging a whole bunch

204
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:22,122
of dead things out there

205
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:26,364
in the world.

206
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,730
There are estimated to be

207
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,233
four hundred million dogs

208
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:32,604
in the world

209
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,788
and 300 different breeds.

210
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:40,491
But very few of them are suited

211
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:41,924
to surviving in a life

212
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,262
after humans.

213
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,004
The smallest dogs

214
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,567
probably won't last a week

215
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:51,305
without us.

216
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,311
There's probably no niche

217
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:55,046
for the smaller dogs.

218
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,217
Dogs are very competitive

219
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:57,419
and when you have wolves,

220
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:58,621
they displace coyotes,

221
00:09:58,622 --> 00:09:59,753
coyotes displace foxes,

222
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:00,885
and we would assume

223
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,459
that hierarchy would prevail

224
00:10:03,494 --> 00:10:06,464
among domestic dogs.

225
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:07,130
In fact,

226
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,832
many of the unique features

227
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,500
that have been bred into dogs

228
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,909
over the years

229
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,947
will now become major handicaps

230
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:16,050
in the fight for survival.

231
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:16,946
There are dog

232
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:18,313
for the really short legs,

233
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:19,180
i think,the dogs

234
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:21,088
with the really short faces

235
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:23,462
or long faces, i think,

236
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:25,295
that they're all doomed.

237
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,127
You know, they're not

238
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,169
gonna move well,

239
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,054
they're not gonna be able

240
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,939
to search and explore.

241
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,311
I think that the kind of

242
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:37,416
the middle of the spectrum,

243
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,487
the kind of average dog,

244
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:43,294
has the best chances in this.

245
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:46,029
I think that they will survive

246
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:47,731
in the long haul,

247
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:51,067
but it's not gonna be pretty.

248
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:52,609
As the surviving dogs

249
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,891
struggle to find

250
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:55,173
their new niche,

251
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:56,110
household pests

252
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:57,878
are slowly beginning to notice

253
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:04,258
our absence.

254
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,131
Little creatures,

255
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,729
rats and house mice,

256
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:08,796
they would seem to be able

257
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,333
to exist without us

258
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,100
are surprisingly quite dependent

259
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:14,745
on our food supplies.

260
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:15,947
Rats and mice

261
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:17,715
are usually termed

262
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,413
"commensal rodents," which means

263
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:20,915
that term means literally

264
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,087
sharing the table.

265
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:23,259
They're very dependent

266
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,561
on people.

267
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:26,264
And the little house mouse

268
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,667
and norway rat

269
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:30,271
are great examples of animals

270
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:33,658
that would do less well

271
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,011
in the absence of people.

272
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,083
In the initial weeks

273
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:39,435
after people are gone,

274
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,787
they will raid pantries

275
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:43,553
in homes,in grocery shelves

276
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:51,535
in stores.

277
00:11:51,537 --> 00:11:52,372
After eating through

278
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:53,208
these food supplies,

279
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:55,212
they will struggle to survive

280
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,215
on things like cardboard, cloth,

281
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,385
or glue.

282
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,082
I think that if a city

283
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:03,019
was abandoned,

284
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,086
the rats would have to go back

285
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:06,630
to earning an honest living.

286
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:07,531
An honest living

287
00:12:07,532 --> 00:12:11,067
means to go back to the wild

288
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:14,673
and compete for resources there.

289
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,805
Eventually, these rodents

290
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,994
will abandon homes

291
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,182
and buildings,

292
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:20,979
which will make them

293
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:26,663
easy pickings for predators.

294
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:27,645
Although, rats and mice

295
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,626
will mostly likely survive

296
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:29,767
in the future,

297
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:30,428
their numbers

298
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:39,043
will be greatly diminished.

299
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:40,180
After six months

300
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:43,920
into a life after people,

301
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:44,392
urban areas

302
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:46,455
are already taking a turn

303
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,829
for the wild.

304
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,301
The predators would return

305
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,464
very quickly in the absence

306
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,907
of humans

307
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:55,310
because we suppress them,

308
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:56,672
we create conditions

309
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,325
that either work against them,

310
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,355
or we deliberately go out,

311
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,351
and remove and destroy them.

312
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:03,223
they would come back

313
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:06,187
very quickly.

314
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:07,460
Smaller predators

315
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,814
like coyotes and bobcats

316
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:10,133
always survive on the fringe

317
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:12,503
of human populations.

318
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,200
They are the first to colonize

319
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:18,809
our abandoned neighborhoods.

320
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:19,574
Larger carnivores

321
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:20,952
will have to wait longer

322
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:21,713
for the habitat

323
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:22,550
to recover enough

324
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,358
to support their appetites.

325
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,262
But soon enough, they, too,

326
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:28,329
will hunt in what

327
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:33,402
were once our backyards.

328
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,389
One year into a life

329
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,890
after people,

330
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,858
towns and cities

331
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,196
are still recognizable.

332
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:48,756
But nature

333
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,500
is beginning to reclaim

334
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:54,532
her old turf.

335
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,307
One of the first

336
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:56,610
great physical effects

337
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:58,243
in the absence of people

338
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:00,281
would be the transition

339
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:01,698
of the impervious surfaces:

340
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,080
the parking lots, the roads

341
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,504
into places that supported

342
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,928
and then had an abundance

343
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,964
of plant life.

344
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:11,429
Any place

345
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:12,736
where you have sunlight

346
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:15,300
that's hitting,

347
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:15,941
you're probably gonna get

348
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,644
some plant growth.

349
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:18,175
Little seeds

350
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:18,811
are gonna get stuck

351
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,478
in the cracks and so forth,

352
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,915
and these things

353
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,986
are all gonna start to creep.

354
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:27,320
plants are wonderful that way.

355
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,310
They can destroy things

356
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:31,266
in matters of, you know,

357
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:39,205
a few years.

358
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,880
Without humans

359
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,513
to remove them,

360
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,116
weeds like dandelions

361
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:44,718
infiltrate every crack

362
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:48,093
in the pavement.

363
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:49,426
as these weeds die,

364
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:50,758
their remnants combine

365
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,301
with ever-spreading moss

366
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,863
and lichen

367
00:14:53,864 --> 00:15:00,374
to create a layer of topsoil.

368
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:01,445
This sandy soil

369
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:04,185
is poor in nutrients,

370
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,383
so only plants like clover

371
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:07,455
that can pull nitrogen

372
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:08,958
from the air

373
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,000
flourish at first.

374
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:14,898
Formerly manicured yards

375
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:18,272
morph into fields

376
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:19,705
for a white-tailed deer

377
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:23,948
forage for food.

378
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:25,785
Wild animals have also begun

379
00:15:25,786 --> 00:15:26,717
to find their way

380
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:32,096
into abandoned cities.

381
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:37,475
Man's supposed domination

382
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,606
over nature

383
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,160
has proven to be quite tenuous.

384
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:43,714
The signs of our vulnerability

385
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:47,650
have always been there.

386
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:49,995
This is an ailanthus tree.

387
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:52,128
it seems to enjoy rooting itself

388
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,097
in very inhospitable locations.

389
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:56,065
And it likes to attach itself

390
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:57,739
to crevices in buildings.

391
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:58,869
And when it does so,

392
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,172
it causes damage.

393
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:01,439
The roots expand,

394
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:04,117
and the expansive forces of that

395
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,546
force out mortar

396
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,383
and stone and cause crumbling

397
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,385
of a facade.

398
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:09,452
If you get a lot of this

399
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:10,989
on an entire building facade,

400
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,161
it could cause

401
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:19,543
major, major damage.

402
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:21,847
as nature battles back,

403
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:23,580
even manmade goliaths

404
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,919
like Hoover dam

405
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:27,521
aren't invincible.

406
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:29,089
To harness the power

407
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,256
of this river

408
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,295
took 21,000 men and five years

409
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:37,899
of hard labor.

410
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:40,222
But one year after people,

411
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:42,511
its 17 massive and seemingly

412
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:44,114
indestructible generators

413
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:45,716
are about to be brought down

414
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,254
by an organism

415
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:54,700
the size of a human thumbnail.

416
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:55,963
The lake above the dam

417
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:56,904
is infested

418
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:58,167
with an invasive species

419
00:16:58,202 --> 00:16:59,067
of mollusk

420
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:02,814
called the "quagga mussel."

421
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:04,046
This stealthy invader

422
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:04,983
from Eastern Europe

423
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:06,650
had no natural predators

424
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,289
in North America

425
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:09,855
other than the humans tasked

426
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:11,458
with scraping it from the grates

427
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:14,393
and pipes it colonizes.

428
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:15,995
The mussels attach themselves

429
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,242
to the inside wall of pipes

430
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:21,805
and they're very prolific.

431
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,746
They colonize

432
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:24,109
and rapidly build up

433
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,176
and can grow

434
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,784
on top of each other,

435
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,490
and eventually completely block

436
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:42,108
the diameter of a pipe.

437
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:42,979
The small pipes

438
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,632
that bring cooling water

439
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,285
to Hoover dam's generators

440
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,216
make perfect homes

441
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:49,115
for these creatures.

442
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,291
And with no people around

443
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:51,723
to remove them,

444
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:54,859
they spread like a cancer.

445
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:55,460
And in fact,

446
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:57,714
those mussels could clog up

447
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,968
the cooling water pipes,

448
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:00,333
to the point

449
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:01,976
where we couldn't keep

450
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:11,856
these generators cool anymore.

451
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,028
And it would cause

452
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,431
the high temperature alarm

453
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:17,636
in the automatic control system.

454
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:18,598
And that automatic

455
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,550
control system

456
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:20,466
would then start

457
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:21,972
the shutdown sequence

458
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:25,047
of that generator.

459
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,050
Well, that would happen

460
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:26,847
one by one

461
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:27,983
for all of the generators

462
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:28,634
of Hoover dam,

463
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:29,250
and eventually

464
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:30,256
the entire power plant

465
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:33,662
would be shut down.

466
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:34,844
In Las Vegas,

467
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,991
the last glimmers

468
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:38,369
of manmade light on Earth

469
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,702
relinquish the night

470
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:43,579
to its primeval blackness.

471
00:18:43,614 --> 00:18:44,239
With the generators

472
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,577
no longer running,

473
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:46,879
no water at all

474
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:53,094
is passing through Hoover dam.

475
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:54,122
And the Colorado river

476
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:58,313
downstream begins to run dry.

477
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:02,469
On the other side of the dam,

478
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,574
the water has nowhere to go

479
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,679
and lake Mead starts to rise.

480
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,250
It would just keep

481
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:11,053
building up in lake Mead.

482
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,856
And it would eventually

483
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:13,427
gets to the point

484
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:14,724
of spilling over

485
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,630
through the spillways

486
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:21,039
on either side of the dam.

487
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,167
Unchecked,

488
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,205
nature's most powerful elements

489
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,748
reclaim their supremacy

490
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:29,919
on Earth.

491
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:32,158
Triggered by lightning strikes,

492
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:32,784
the wildfires

493
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,361
that humans once battled

494
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:35,629
so valiantly

495
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:45,309
now rage unchecked.

496
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,481
Cities and neighborhoods

497
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,214
full of abandoned buildings,

498
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:50,448
wild grasses, and debris

499
00:19:50,449 --> 00:20:01,436
are prime fuel for the flames.

500
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:06,774
Chicago burns.

501
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:07,646
San francisco's

502
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:10,085
stately wooden victorians

503
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,791
are now only useful as kindling.

504
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:17,792
And just as it did

505
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,736
in the time of the ancients,

506
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:25,905
rome is burning again.

507
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:26,672
As structures

508
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:28,409
burn to the ground,

509
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,176
charred timbers

510
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:31,454
release nutrients into the soil,

511
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:32,517
providing the next wave

512
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:33,485
of plant life,

513
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,419
with the nitrogen

514
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,364
it needs to grow

515
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:52,514
and thrive.

516
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,723
Five years after people,

517
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:55,755
the roads of the world

518
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,696
are disappearing

519
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:58,228
beneath a green map

520
00:20:58,263 --> 00:20:58,829
that spreads

521
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:04,108
like some relentless monster.

522
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:06,111
The advance of nature

523
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:08,114
knows no boundaries.

524
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:08,511
The gates

525
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:10,333
of London's Buckingham palace

526
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,121
are easily breached by vines

527
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:14,691
and moss.

528
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:16,688
In Moscow, red square

529
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:19,864
is becoming very green.

530
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:20,330
In reality,

531
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:21,667
nature will reclaim Earth

532
00:21:21,702 --> 00:21:24,271
very quickly.

533
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:25,303
These stairs were cleared

534
00:21:25,338 --> 00:21:27,546
18 months ago.

535
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:27,972
If we came back

536
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:29,178
in another 18 months,

537
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:29,980
we'd have a hard time

538
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:32,314
finding them.

539
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:33,517
If we came back in five years,

540
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:34,719
it would be almost impossible

541
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:36,957
to find.

542
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:38,865
Man's mastery over nature

543
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,525
has always been

544
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:44,403
just an illusion.

545
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,575
When the cambodian city

546
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:46,442
of Angkor

547
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:48,040
and its temple complexes

548
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,784
were abandoned in 15th century,

549
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:52,001
jungle trees grew

550
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,218
indiscriminately

551
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:54,957
over its stone structures.

552
00:21:54,992 --> 00:22:00,230
Entangling them in their roots.

553
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:05,468
now, without armies of gardeners

554
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:06,941
and repairmen,

555
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,714
modern cities are laid bare

556
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:13,281
to nature's revenge.

557
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:15,205
In New York's Central Park,

558
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,128
the great lawns, now untended,

559
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:20,165
sprout with saplings.

560
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,167
Five years without humans

561
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:23,803
leaves the park

562
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:27,574
looking more like a forest.

563
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:31,581
Central Park will go bananas.

564
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,652
so all of a sudden

565
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:33,413
you'll get trees,

566
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:36,389
you'll get growth.

567
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,427
All the animals and plants

568
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,465
that are there now will go up

569
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:41,793
in population levels

570
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,129
and they'll start to spread out

571
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,238
into the city.

572
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,280
The story is the same

573
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:52,845
in Washington D.C.

574
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:53,582
The great monuments

575
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:59,927
have been swallowed by greenery.

576
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:01,865
And on what used to be

577
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,803
the national mall,

578
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:05,066
the sounds of the jungle

579
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:06,220
are echoing.

580
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:07,339
Zoo animals

581
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,529
are really the great unknown.

582
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:13,719
Depending on whether or not

583
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,152
they could escape

584
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:16,089
from their confinement,

585
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:18,487
then things change dramatically

586
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:20,030
because you might have lions,

587
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,432
you might have tigers;

588
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,099
both of which

589
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,535
would be perfectly capable

590
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:24,563
of surviving

591
00:23:24,598 --> 00:23:30,472
in a post-human period.

592
00:23:30,507 --> 00:23:32,109
They'd do better further south

593
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,650
than they would do

594
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:34,554
in Washington D.C.

595
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:35,982
But these are animals

596
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:37,218
that are perfectly capable

597
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,661
of figuring out how to do it

598
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:41,065
and how to survive.

599
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,731
Zoo animals

600
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:43,798
may be the great unknown

601
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,815
but there are things

602
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,832
we can know for sure

603
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,434
about life 20 years

604
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:50,975
after people are gone

605
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,516
because there's one spot

606
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,155
on the globe

607
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,258
Where it's already happened.

608
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:23,259
It's 20 years

609
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:29,073
into a life after people.

610
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:29,643
Without humans

611
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:31,376
to apply fresh paint

612
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:32,894
and fill in cracks,

613
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,411
even concrete buildings

614
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:39,059
have already begun to crumble.

615
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,622
Lack of maintenance turns cities

616
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:48,069
into eerie ghost towns.

617
00:24:48,104 --> 00:24:49,636
Animals that have long avoided

618
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:51,539
human population centers

619
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,342
now return to make new homes

620
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:59,823
among the decaying walls.

621
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:02,056
How do we know this?

622
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:02,898
Because there's one place

623
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:04,400
in the world

624
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:11,042
where it's already happened.

625
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:11,572
We're standing

626
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,410
in the central square

627
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,248
of Pripyat, Ukraine,

628
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:16,715
the city that was once

629
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,182
the most modern city

630
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:23,161
in the former Soviet Union.

631
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:27,037
For 20 years now,

632
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:27,734
this city

633
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:29,701
has been sitting abandoned,

634
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,173
and it really gives you

635
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:33,809
a picture of what would happen

636
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,481
if people are removed

637
00:25:35,516 --> 00:25:36,282
from a place

638
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:45,297
of normal civilization.

639
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,429
Evacuated after

640
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,434
the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,

641
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:50,074
Pripyat went

642
00:25:50,076 --> 00:25:55,414
from a city of 50,000

643
00:25:55,415 --> 00:26:10,133
to ghost town overnight.

644
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,311
Dust-covered school rooms remain

645
00:26:12,346 --> 00:26:13,473
as students left them

646
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:26,029
just over 20 years ago.

647
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:28,237
vegetation pries apart masonry

648
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:37,252
as it crawls over buildings.

649
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:38,454
An amusement park

650
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:39,421
scheduled to open

651
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:40,857
four days after the date

652
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:42,390
of the accident

653
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:46,933
remains never used.

654
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:51,475
The park's ferris wheel

655
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,077
accumulates rust

656
00:26:53,078 --> 00:27:09,464
rather than riders.

657
00:27:09,465 --> 00:27:11,167
The bumper cars sit in a state

658
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:19,046
of motionless decay.

659
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:20,853
Pripyat has provided an amazing

660
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:22,087
and rare opportunity

661
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:23,286
to see what happens

662
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:24,925
to a manmade city

663
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,572
when humans disappear.

664
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,043
I can see

665
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:34,210
from my Geiger counter

666
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:35,407
that it's really quite safe

667
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:36,374
to be here,

668
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:38,482
radiation levels

669
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:40,555
were not very high.

670
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:41,523
but you can see

671
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:42,724
that we've really hit

672
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,890
a point of no return

673
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:51,474
in recapturing these facilities.

674
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:52,958
We're in what was

675
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:54,737
the cultural center

676
00:27:54,772 --> 00:27:56,481
of the city of Pripyat.

677
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:57,798
And indeed, this was a place

678
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,115
where friends gathered,

679
00:27:59,116 --> 00:28:01,290
where there would be

680
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:02,491
celebrations,

681
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:03,858
there would be balls,

682
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:05,225
there would be music,

683
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,958
there would be dancing,

684
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:10,234
there would be performing

685
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:13,509
on the stage here behind me.

686
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:15,742
But after 20 years,

687
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:17,044
the forces of nature

688
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:17,977
have started to decay

689
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:21,522
this facility.

690
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:23,325
This concrete soviet facade

691
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,458
may look imposing

692
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,160
but it's no match

693
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:29,465
for the frigid ukranian winters.

694
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,397
As the temperature drops

695
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:31,869
below freezing,

696
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,102
water that has accumulated

697
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:35,270
in cracks, expands,

698
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:36,676
exerting bursting pressure

699
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:38,079
that pulls apart

700
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,419
the masonry.

701
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:42,657
As vegetation grows unchecked,

702
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:43,417
the roots spread

703
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:46,492
through foundations and stairs.

704
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:49,248
These roots suck in moisture

705
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:52,002
that makes them expand and grow.

706
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:54,637
Like miniature hydraulic jacks,

707
00:28:54,672 --> 00:28:55,538
over time,

708
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:57,312
they slowly push apart

709
00:28:57,347 --> 00:29:03,156
the concrete.

710
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:06,396
This is only 20 years.

711
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:07,227
Can you imagine

712
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:08,058
what this facility

713
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:16,542
will look like after 200 years?

714
00:29:16,543 --> 00:29:17,779
After the accident,

715
00:29:17,814 --> 00:29:19,616
scientists expected the worst

716
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:22,281
for the wildlife in the region.

717
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:23,083
Most of the trees

718
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:24,871
in a 11/2 square mile area

719
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:26,659
around the nuclear plant

720
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,564
were killed off by radiation.

721
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,999
Many animals died.

722
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,852
But incredibly, the effect

723
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:36,705
of the absence of humans

724
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:39,180
for 20 years has outweighed

725
00:29:39,215 --> 00:29:40,251
the initial damage

726
00:29:40,252 --> 00:29:47,593
Caused by the nuclear nightmare.

727
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:49,266
this is the red forest,

728
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:50,127
an area

729
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:51,570
that was horribly impacted

730
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:54,239
by radioactivity

731
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:58,210
due to the Chernobyl explosion.

732
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,382
And the trees that you see

733
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:02,287
around me were killed

734
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:05,192
by the radioactivity.

735
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:06,319
The original amounts

736
00:30:06,354 --> 00:30:08,497
of radioactivity were sufficient

737
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:09,859
to kill all of the wildlife

738
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:15,174
in the region as well.

739
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,510
But now we see a resurgence

740
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:25,454
of the wildlife.

741
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,228
As an example of how wildlife

742
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:29,491
has prospered here,

743
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:31,294
we see, here, we have an antler

744
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:33,268
from a red deer and, obviously,

745
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:34,265
a fairly large

746
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,877
and healthy red deer.

747
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,079
Red deer are hardly found

748
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:41,811
in any other areas

749
00:30:41,812 --> 00:30:42,683
in this region

750
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:44,586
and the Chernobyl zone

751
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:45,383
is the only place

752
00:30:45,418 --> 00:30:47,421
that you'll find populations

753
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:51,062
of red deer.

754
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:53,130
We also find russian wild boars

755
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,204
that the populations in the zone

756
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:57,236
are 10 to 15 times higher

757
00:30:57,237 --> 00:30:58,378
than they are outside

758
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:07,393
of the zone.

759
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:08,425
[speaking russian]

760
00:31:08,426 --> 00:31:09,527
We're now at the kindergarten

761
00:31:09,562 --> 00:31:11,497
of karpachi village, not far

762
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:13,432
from the Chernobyl station.

763
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:14,735
children were living here

764
00:31:14,736 --> 00:31:16,568
while their parents worked.

765
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:17,510
But after that night

766
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:19,308
in april 1986,

767
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:23,820
they never returned.

768
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,172
We are in what was formerly

769
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:29,960
a bedroom in this kindergarten

770
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:31,092
where children used to sleep

771
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:34,066
and rest.

772
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:34,433
Now, there's

773
00:31:34,468 --> 00:31:37,022
a certain emptiness here.

774
00:31:37,057 --> 00:31:39,576
All these windows are broken.

775
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:40,547
but the room continues

776
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:45,616
to live on.

777
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:46,082
Birds fly in here

778
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:47,839
and sit on these bars.

779
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:49,562
We even found evidence

780
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:51,625
that an owl comes here.

781
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:53,699
An owl, it regurgitates food,

782
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:57,535
fur, bones, and feathers.

783
00:31:57,536 --> 00:31:58,907
Evidently, it likes to sit here

784
00:31:58,908 --> 00:32:00,425
on this window pane.

785
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,942
So this room continues

786
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:16,131
to maintain life.

787
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:17,608
Even trees which had proven

788
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:19,070
especially vulnerable

789
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,858
to radioactive fallout.

790
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,646
Are finding new homes

791
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:29,527
in the evacuation zone.

792
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:30,053
I'm sitting

793
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:31,991
in the Pripyat soccer stadium

794
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,399
where, 20 years ago,

795
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,635
hundreds of people would come

796
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:35,196
and cheer

797
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:39,744
on their favorite team.

798
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:43,079
You can imagine the laughter

799
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,781
of the sounds

800
00:32:43,782 --> 00:32:47,156
of the crowds here.

801
00:32:47,157 --> 00:32:48,974
The activity on the field

802
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,791
which, 20 years later,

803
00:32:50,792 --> 00:33:01,980
is barely discernable.

804
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,482
The soccer field now is going

805
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:04,480
through succession

806
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,417
as you would expect in returning

807
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,135
to what it was originally

808
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,853
hundreds of years ago

809
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:14,481
which was a mixed

810
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:19,108
deciduous forest.

811
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:20,240
I grew up in a town

812
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:21,694
about like this

813
00:33:21,729 --> 00:33:23,114
and i used to enjoy

814
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:25,800
riding bumper cars like these

815
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:27,945
about a half a world away.

816
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,056
And it seems pretty sad

817
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,027
when you look now

818
00:33:31,028 --> 00:33:32,130
and you see what's become

819
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:33,813
of this beautiful city

820
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:39,499
of pripiat and that people

821
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:42,722
will never live here again.

822
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:45,911
But there's another side

823
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:47,184
to this story,

824
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:49,217
a very encouraging side;

825
00:33:49,218 --> 00:33:51,005
one that says that life

826
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,793
is much more resilient

827
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:54,927
than what we thought possible.

828
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:57,671
That in the absence of man,

829
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:59,424
that life will continue

830
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:02,451
and that life will thrive

831
00:34:02,486 --> 00:34:05,443
and that the legacy of life

832
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,052
will always be here,

833
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,951
because we are a part of life.

834
00:34:09,952 --> 00:34:11,388
Even if we disappear,

835
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:12,825
our legacy of life

836
00:34:12,826 --> 00:34:14,399
will continue.

837
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:30,108
It's 25 years into a life after people

838
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,654
Out in the country

839
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,879
nature is beginning to erase all evidence of man

840
00:34:45,657 --> 00:34:46,681
in the suburb

841
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:51,789
packs of fellow dogs roam through decaying neighborhoods

842
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,461
in search of their next meal.

843
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:59,132
In some of the great cities

844
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:00,504
of the world,

845
00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:02,107
solid ground is getting harder

846
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:06,509
to find.

847
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:08,186
In the time of humans,

848
00:35:08,187 --> 00:35:09,418
London was protected

849
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:10,650
from tidal surges

850
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:13,195
by 10 retractable steel gates

851
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:13,891
that could be raised

852
00:35:13,926 --> 00:35:15,728
during storms to seal off

853
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:16,860
the Thames river

854
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:21,008
from the north sea.

855
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:21,768
without humans

856
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:24,412
to operate the barrier,

857
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:32,386
London is defenseless.

858
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:34,530
another low-lying city,

859
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,661
Amsterdam,

860
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:44,641
meets the same watery fate.

861
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:53,621
In a New York city high rise,

862
00:35:53,622 --> 00:35:55,544
some windows have already

863
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:57,467
cracked and slipped loose

864
00:35:57,468 --> 00:36:01,423
from their frames and many more

865
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:05,379
are on the verge of destruction.

866
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,582
After a quarter century

867
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,110
of exposure to moisture

868
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:10,588
and heat without maintenance,

869
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:12,356
the normally flexible window

870
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:14,124
sealant has become rigid,

871
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,195
locking this window

872
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:17,529
to its frame.

873
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,062
As the metal frame expands

874
00:36:19,063 --> 00:36:20,606
and contracts with changes

875
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:23,269
in temperature,

876
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,271
it induces stresses

877
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:25,742
on the glass.

878
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:29,013
It cracks and plummets

879
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:32,284
to the sidewalk below.

880
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,957
After a few of the windows

881
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,428
fall out of a building

882
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:36,491
like this,

883
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:38,194
then the wind pressure effect

884
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,565
changes dramatically.

885
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:40,948
As well as external pressure

886
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:42,200
coming on to the building,

887
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:43,672
you also get suction.

888
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:45,074
And that aggravates the problem

889
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:48,580
so more of the panels

890
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:52,086
are likely to fall out.

891
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,319
Through these gaping holes,

892
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:54,289
the building fills

893
00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:01,902
with windswept debris.

894
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:05,223
A summer storm rolls in.

895
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:08,543
On top of the structure,

896
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:10,031
the copper-lightning deterrent

897
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,518
system that once protected

898
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,421
thousands of office workers

899
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:18,545
is now corroded and useless.

900
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,668
A lightning bolt turns the tower

901
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:31,867
into a raging inferno.

902
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:40,065
The gutted building makes

903
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,266
the perfect home

904
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:48,809
for a surprising survivor.

905
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,951
Although pigeons once relied

906
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,405
on the handouts of humans,

907
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,858
they have done just fine

908
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:58,545
in 25 years without us.

909
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,825
Pigeons are survivors.

910
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,071
they can live in the wild;

911
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,935
they do live in the wild still.

912
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:06,844
And in a period

913
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:08,380
where there were no people

914
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:10,214
but there still were edifices

915
00:38:10,215 --> 00:38:12,047
and artifacts, our buildings,

916
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:13,054
they would do very well

917
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,490
because they would adopt these

918
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,157
as kind of

919
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,594
artificial cliff faces,

920
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:17,596
which is what they really are

921
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:21,828
adapted to.

922
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:26,510
Like the pigeon,

923
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,742
the disappearance of humans

924
00:38:27,743 --> 00:38:29,145
forced a change in the habits

925
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,550
of the lowly cockroach.

926
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:34,624
think of the poor cockroach

927
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:35,455
after they gorge

928
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:37,493
upon our surplus

929
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,531
when we're gone,

930
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:41,736
they'll mourn us.

931
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,263
They'll be sorry.

932
00:38:43,298 --> 00:38:44,640
but the morning won't last

933
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:47,140
for long.

934
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,307
While cockroaches thrived

935
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:49,908
on our scraps,

936
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:51,852
they can also eat bookbindings,

937
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:53,684
and cardboard,

938
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:55,587
and any rotting organic matter

939
00:38:55,588 --> 00:38:59,624
including dead leaves and roots.

940
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:02,129
while food isn't a problem,

941
00:39:02,164 --> 00:39:04,633
roaches also need warmth;

942
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:05,534
the kind that humans

943
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:06,742
had always supplied

944
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:11,284
through artificial heat.

945
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,285
Cockroaches started

946
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:14,038
as a tropical species

947
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:15,756
and some experts say

948
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,293
they couldn't survive the winter

949
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:21,099
in colder cities.

950
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,896
But it's hard to bet

951
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:23,402
against a creature that has seen

952
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:27,008
the dinosaurs come and go.

953
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,326
Cockroaches are

954
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:29,643
extremely adaptable.

955
00:39:29,644 --> 00:39:30,214
They've been around

956
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:31,547
for 300 million years.

957
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:32,248
If i have to bet,

958
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:33,350
i'd put my money on them

959
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:34,451
being able to survive

960
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:37,757
in one form or another.

961
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,027
The first winter

962
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:42,664
after humans did witness

963
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:46,301
the die-off of some cockroaches,

964
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:47,974
but many more moved underground

965
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:49,471
to find warmth until

966
00:39:49,506 --> 00:39:54,353
milder temperatures returned.

967
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:56,217
In an abandoned downtown

968
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:58,040
devoid of insecticides,

969
00:39:58,075 --> 00:39:59,862
overrun by vegetation

970
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:02,768
and with a rising water table,

971
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:04,872
this former pest is now enjoying

972
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:16,115
a golden age.

973
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,692
Cockroaches were only a nuisance

974
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:21,658
to humans,

975
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:27,704
but wolves were a terror.

976
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:30,543
So man hunted them mercilessly.

977
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:32,176
When the first european settlers

978
00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:33,277
arrived in what is now

979
00:40:33,278 --> 00:40:34,986
the United States,

980
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:36,152
it's believed nearly half

981
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:37,284
a million wolves roamed

982
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:39,387
the country side.

983
00:40:39,422 --> 00:40:41,490
By the 20th century,

984
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:42,332
these predators

985
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,966
were nearly extinct

986
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:47,600
in the lower 48 states.

987
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:49,203
Now, with no humans left

988
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:50,575
to battle them,

989
00:40:50,576 --> 00:40:52,214
wolf populations multiply

990
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,614
by as much six times each year.

991
00:40:55,649 --> 00:40:56,655
Within 25 years

992
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:58,258
of our disappearance,

993
00:40:58,259 --> 00:40:59,660
there could easily be half

994
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:03,697
a million of them roaming

995
00:41:03,732 --> 00:41:06,433
the United States again.

996
00:41:06,468 --> 00:41:09,135
This amazing comeback

997
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:09,907
has been seen

998
00:41:09,908 --> 00:41:13,313
on a small scale before.

999
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:16,718
In 1995, biologists released

1000
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,151
a few dozen wolves

1001
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:19,087
within the boundaries

1002
00:41:19,122 --> 00:41:23,028
of yellow stone national park;

1003
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:23,660
a place

1004
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:30,391
where they would be protected

1005
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:37,121
from persecution by humans.

1006
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:38,189
Within a decade,

1007
00:41:38,224 --> 00:41:39,725
a few dozen had multiplied

1008
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:41,408
into 1,500

1009
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:42,667
and the wolves

1010
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:43,892
quickly spread out

1011
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:45,495
from their release point

1012
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:46,532
to occupy territory

1013
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:47,534
throughout the states

1014
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:55,211
of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.

1015
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,233
it would be fast

1016
00:41:56,268 --> 00:41:57,220
if you can start

1017
00:41:57,255 --> 00:41:58,772
with just a few dozen wolves

1018
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,290
and in the course of one decade,

1019
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:02,593
have a population of 1,500

1020
00:42:02,594 --> 00:42:03,645
and you could have

1021
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,696
a geographic expansion

1022
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:06,299
where they filled up a big chunk

1023
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,602
of a three-state area.

1024
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:08,098
And these are

1025
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:09,604
big western states.

1026
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:10,506
Yeah, when the conditions

1027
00:42:10,507 --> 00:42:11,173
are right,

1028
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,079
they can re-colonize

1029
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,585
pretty rapidly.

1030
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:16,986
Could we see them in Manhattan

1031
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,991
or Chicago?

1032
00:42:19,992 --> 00:42:21,424
As soon as the deer get there,

1033
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:22,225
the wolves will be right

1034
00:42:22,226 --> 00:42:30,805
behind them.

1035
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,536
Animals haven't

1036
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:37,530
just been hunted by humans;

1037
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:41,163
they've also been hemmed in.

1038
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:44,761
There are roughly three million

1039
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,234
miles of paved road

1040
00:42:46,235 --> 00:42:49,470
in the United States alone.

1041
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:52,705
And it's no coincidence

1042
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:53,807
that many of them cut

1043
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:54,974
right through the paths

1044
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,911
animals use to get from place

1045
00:42:56,912 --> 00:42:59,716
to place.

1046
00:42:59,717 --> 00:43:00,558
The things that make

1047
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,161
a landscape good

1048
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:03,729
for animal movement

1049
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:05,065
also make it easy to engineer

1050
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:09,002
a road in that location.

1051
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,805
So, we've cut off pretty much

1052
00:43:10,806 --> 00:43:14,196
all major migrations

1053
00:43:14,231 --> 00:43:17,551
in North America.

1054
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:19,018
Asphalt and automobiles

1055
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:20,721
wreaked particular havoc

1056
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:29,305
on the grizzly bear.

1057
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:29,965
Their habitat

1058
00:43:29,966 --> 00:43:32,740
was so carved up by roads

1059
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:34,343
that they're confined

1060
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,447
to isolated pockets,

1061
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:36,516
cutting them off

1062
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:37,819
from food sources

1063
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:43,208
and potential mates.

1064
00:43:43,243 --> 00:43:48,596
In a life after humans,

1065
00:43:48,597 --> 00:43:50,299
roads are no longer barriers

1066
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,608
for the grizzly.

1067
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:54,576
Instead they are pathways;

1068
00:43:54,611 --> 00:43:56,509
trails that lead them back

1069
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,451
into the heart

1070
00:43:57,452 --> 00:44:00,948
of their former range.

1071
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,975
Forty years after people.

1072
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,207
While cities of steel

1073
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,004
and concrete

1074
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:17,308
are still standing tall,

1075
00:44:17,343 --> 00:44:22,020
the suburbs are under attack.

1076
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:23,954
Roughly 90 percent of all homes

1077
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:25,326
in the United States

1078
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:28,597
have wood frames.

1079
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:34,471
while some have burned,

1080
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:42,925
others are now being devoured.

1081
00:44:42,926 --> 00:44:45,329
Without paint and preservatives,

1082
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:46,326
the lumber of homes

1083
00:44:46,361 --> 00:44:50,838
is defenseless against termites.

1084
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:52,556
Termites feast on cellulose,

1085
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:54,274
the basic building block

1086
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,243
of wood.

1087
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:58,215
and their appetites

1088
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,153
are relentless.

1089
00:45:00,154 --> 00:45:01,281
Some colonies can eat

1090
00:45:01,316 --> 00:45:03,659
as much as 1,000 pounds of wood

1091
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:08,833
per year.

1092
00:45:08,868 --> 00:45:10,800
In this destructive advance,

1093
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:11,467
the termites

1094
00:45:11,502 --> 00:45:12,718
aren't working alone.

1095
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:13,935
The process we know

1096
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:15,243
as rotting will occur

1097
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:16,510
when the wood gets exposed

1098
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:19,184
to the elements.

1099
00:45:19,245 --> 00:45:20,446
And this rotting, actually,

1100
00:45:20,447 --> 00:45:22,751
is a more complicated process.

1101
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:24,122
It's a process by which microbes

1102
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:25,194
attack the wood

1103
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:26,947
and release carbon dioxide

1104
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:28,700
and methane to the atmosphere.

1105
00:45:28,735 --> 00:45:30,132
If humans were to leave,

1106
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:31,064
it'd be a matter of decades

1107
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:32,135
before most structures

1108
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:32,667
that had significant

1109
00:45:32,702 --> 00:45:33,738
wood components

1110
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:36,813
would start to decay.

1111
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:37,439
Faced with

1112
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:38,645
a two pronged attack

1113
00:45:38,646 --> 00:45:40,879
from termites and rot,

1114
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,623
the beams that hold up the roof

1115
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:45,227
give way.

1116
00:45:45,228 --> 00:45:46,054
And the boundary

1117
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:47,797
between inside and out,

1118
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:49,564
that had once been so important

1119
00:45:49,565 --> 00:45:50,361
to the humans

1120
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:53,570
who called this building home,

1121
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:55,990
is forever erased.

1122
00:45:56,025 --> 00:45:58,374
Other substances

1123
00:45:58,409 --> 00:45:59,510
like this mortar and rock

1124
00:45:59,511 --> 00:46:00,897
are gonna last longer

1125
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:02,284
than several decades,

1126
00:46:02,285 --> 00:46:03,686
but they'll still crumble

1127
00:46:03,687 --> 00:46:04,789
after natural, chemical,

1128
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:05,521
and physical weathering

1129
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:06,357
processes,

1130
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:07,493
and eventually these walls

1131
00:46:07,494 --> 00:46:09,031
will fall down as well,

1132
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,772
and there'll be no remnants.

1133
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:16,478
Now, nature will act quickly

1134
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:20,344
to swallow up these ruins.

1135
00:46:20,379 --> 00:46:21,485
This crumbling house

1136
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:23,539
in Baltimore's druid hill park

1137
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:25,593
was once home to the caretaker

1138
00:46:25,628 --> 00:46:27,725
of the city zoo.

1139
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:28,527
It looks like this building

1140
00:46:28,528 --> 00:46:29,264
has been abandoned

1141
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:31,031
for more than a hundred years.

1142
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:31,803
But in reality,

1143
00:46:31,804 --> 00:46:32,966
people have been living here

1144
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,570
up till 40 years ago.

1145
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:36,140
It's amazing how quickly

1146
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:38,014
the vegetation has reclaimed

1147
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:38,780
the area.

1148
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:40,416
The vines have started to climb

1149
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:41,945
up the walls.

1150
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,820
The trees are growing

1151
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:44,223
into the structure,

1152
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:45,425
and they're both physically

1153
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,626
pulling the structure apart,

1154
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:50,793
and chemically dissolving it.

1155
00:46:50,795 --> 00:46:52,396
Structures built entirely

1156
00:46:52,397 --> 00:46:53,869
of stone or masonry

1157
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:54,966
will far outlive

1158
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:58,476
anything made of wood.

1159
00:46:58,477 --> 00:46:59,473
Exactly how fast

1160
00:46:59,508 --> 00:47:00,980
they will crumble depends

1161
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:07,621
on their environment.

1162
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:09,579
The coast of Maine, really,

1163
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:11,467
isn't very kind to buildings.

1164
00:47:11,468 --> 00:47:12,349
Structures out here

1165
00:47:12,384 --> 00:47:13,196
don't so much decay

1166
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,432
when you live them alone;

1167
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:16,907
they melt.

1168
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:17,707
These structures

1169
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,541
on Black Island, Maine

1170
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:20,378
used to be part

1171
00:47:20,413 --> 00:47:22,545
of a granite quarry whose stone

1172
00:47:22,546 --> 00:47:24,398
was used to build and decorate

1173
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:26,251
cities like Boston, New York,

1174
00:47:26,252 --> 00:47:30,057
and Philadelphia.

1175
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:33,634
It was abandoned around 1920.

1176
00:47:33,669 --> 00:47:34,437
here, the buildings

1177
00:47:34,472 --> 00:47:35,206
have all vanished

1178
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:36,659
within the space

1179
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:38,111
of 80 and 90 years.

1180
00:47:38,112 --> 00:47:41,947
There's almost nothing left.

1181
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:45,783
in the right conditions

1182
00:47:45,784 --> 00:47:47,572
and with human maintenance,

1183
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:50,537
stone construction can last

1184
00:47:50,572 --> 00:47:52,970
for thousands of years.

1185
00:47:53,005 --> 00:47:55,369
in some places in Europe,

1186
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,841
ancient roman aqueducts

1187
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:59,205
are still in use.

1188
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:01,008
But without maintenance,

1189
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:02,811
stone can fall victim

1190
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:05,586
to a very stealthy enemy.

1191
00:48:05,657 --> 00:48:06,317
One of the great enemies

1192
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:07,660
of stone is actually salts

1193
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:08,927
and salt crystals.

1194
00:48:08,962 --> 00:48:10,424
even thousands of years ago,

1195
00:48:10,565 --> 00:48:11,696
people notice the effect

1196
00:48:11,697 --> 00:48:13,399
that salts had on deteriorating

1197
00:48:13,434 --> 00:48:18,076
the ancient pyramids.

1198
00:48:18,077 --> 00:48:19,178
There are many ways

1199
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:21,312
salts infiltrate stone buildings

1200
00:48:21,313 --> 00:48:22,710
and monuments:

1201
00:48:22,745 --> 00:48:25,288
polluted air, seawater,

1202
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:27,407
and even bird droppings.

1203
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:29,525
soluble salts dissolve

1204
00:48:29,526 --> 00:48:30,222
in water,

1205
00:48:30,257 --> 00:48:31,398
and as the water evaporates,

1206
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:33,231
it will rise up inside

1207
00:48:33,232 --> 00:48:34,884
of porous building materials;

1208
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:36,536
things like brick and stone

1209
00:48:36,537 --> 00:48:37,738
and even concrete.

1210
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:39,772
And what happens is the salts

1211
00:48:39,773 --> 00:48:40,944
will continue to grow

1212
00:48:40,945 --> 00:48:43,278
inside the pores of the stone

1213
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:44,419
until they come up

1214
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,088
against the side of the wall,

1215
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,755
and they'll actually push

1216
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:52,432
the stone apart.

1217
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:53,300
What we're seeing

1218
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:54,551
in this time-lapse video

1219
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:55,767
really shows the rapid decay

1220
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:57,270
of the stone in response

1221
00:48:57,271 --> 00:49:02,179
to this deterioration by salts.

1222
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:03,049
In this experiment,

1223
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,412
it took about three weeks to go

1224
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:10,021
from this piece of stone

1225
00:49:10,022 --> 00:49:11,623
to this piece of stone,

1226
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:13,667
which is completely deteriorated

1227
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:15,085
by sodium sulfate

1228
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,502
crystallization.

1229
00:49:16,503 --> 00:49:18,470
Three weeks in this

1230
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:20,438
accelerated aging chamber

1231
00:49:20,439 --> 00:49:22,592
are equivalent to a few years

1232
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,746
in the harshest of environments,

1233
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:26,648
or a few decades in a more

1234
00:49:26,649 --> 00:49:28,151
benign desert climate.

1235
00:49:28,186 --> 00:49:29,619
If we could see

1236
00:49:29,654 --> 00:49:30,794
microscopically what's going on

1237
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:33,099
inside the pyramids,

1238
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:33,700
this is what

1239
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:34,567
would be taking place.

1240
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:35,663
You can actually see the salts

1241
00:49:35,698 --> 00:49:40,641
deteriorate the stone.

1242
00:49:40,642 --> 00:49:43,115
Although not immune to decay,

1243
00:49:43,116 --> 00:49:44,984
the pyramids have survived

1244
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:46,817
for nearly 5,000 years

1245
00:49:46,852 --> 00:49:48,984
because of their sheer volume

1246
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:49,786
and their hot,

1247
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:52,075
dry desert environment.

1248
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,704
Too massive to be destroyed

1249
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:56,690
by either man or nature,

1250
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:58,641
the pyramids of Giza

1251
00:49:58,642 --> 00:49:59,823
were the only one

1252
00:49:59,858 --> 00:50:00,970
of the seven wonders

1253
00:50:01,005 --> 00:50:03,348
of the ancient world to survive

1254
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:05,712
into the modern era.

1255
00:50:05,713 --> 00:50:07,035
Many ancient monuments

1256
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,357
have survived only

1257
00:50:08,358 --> 00:50:11,577
because of human maintenance

1258
00:50:11,612 --> 00:50:14,797
throughout the centuries.

1259
00:50:14,798 --> 00:50:16,165
The sphinx was uncovered

1260
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,132
and restored for the first time

1261
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:21,338
back in 1400 b.c.

1262
00:50:21,339 --> 00:50:22,881
Modern experts who have studied

1263
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:24,513
the sphinx, predict

1264
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:26,647
that without human intervention,

1265
00:50:26,682 --> 00:50:28,489
deterioration from salts

1266
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,493
and wind erosion could render it

1267
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:31,890
a pile of dust

1268
00:50:31,925 --> 00:50:41,240
within 500 to 1,000 years.

1269
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:43,273
The largest concrete structures

1270
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:47,916
like Hoover dam, will last

1271
00:50:47,951 --> 00:50:52,558
even longer than that.

1272
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:53,910
Hoover is so thick

1273
00:50:53,945 --> 00:50:55,262
that over 70 years

1274
00:50:55,263 --> 00:50:56,996
after it was constructed

1275
00:50:56,997 --> 00:50:58,539
the concrete deep inside

1276
00:50:58,574 --> 00:51:03,877
was still curing.

1277
00:51:03,878 --> 00:51:05,851
But of the 15 tallest dams

1278
00:51:05,886 --> 00:51:07,753
in the United States,

1279
00:51:07,754 --> 00:51:10,453
only 10 are concrete.

1280
00:51:10,488 --> 00:51:12,290
The others are made of compacted

1281
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:14,129
rock or Earth,

1282
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:15,466
like Northern California's

1283
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:19,438
Trinity dam.

1284
00:51:19,473 --> 00:51:21,406
If there were humans around,

1285
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:22,738
this leak in the dam would get

1286
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:26,143
an emergency fix.

1287
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:30,290
But those days are long gone.

1288
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:31,352
Some of these dams

1289
00:51:31,353 --> 00:51:33,957
are absolutely enormous.

1290
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:35,261
And if they fail,

1291
00:51:35,296 --> 00:51:36,629
as they will in time,

1292
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:37,962
then the surge of water

1293
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:39,736
that falls in behind them

1294
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:40,838
and cascades

1295
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:43,177
down a valley below

1296
00:51:43,212 --> 00:51:44,844
would have a huge force,

1297
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:47,699
big enough to sweep away

1298
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:50,553
everything on its path.

1299
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,004
Fifty years after humans,

1300
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:04,306
the strain of neglect

1301
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:05,696
is beginning to show

1302
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:11,679
on even the best design

1303
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:17,593
of manmade structures.

1304
00:52:17,628 --> 00:52:19,430
Everything that man designs

1305
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,802
carries within it, the seeds

1306
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:22,605
of its own destruction;

1307
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,408
that includes bridges

1308
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:26,542
and buildings.

1309
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,584
The Brooklyn bridge,

1310
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:31,190
one of the most famous bridges

1311
00:52:31,225 --> 00:52:34,796
in the world for over 125 years.

1312
00:52:34,831 --> 00:52:35,527
The reason

1313
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,460
that bridges last so long

1314
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:38,714
is because engineers

1315
00:52:38,749 --> 00:52:39,934
look after them.

1316
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:41,236
They inspect them regularly,

1317
00:52:41,237 --> 00:52:42,238
they maintain them,

1318
00:52:42,273 --> 00:52:43,239
they paint them,

1319
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:44,472
they replace pieces that need

1320
00:52:44,507 --> 00:52:45,791
to be replaced.

1321
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:47,101
Without people,

1322
00:52:47,136 --> 00:52:48,377
without engineers,

1323
00:52:48,378 --> 00:52:50,080
the deterioration process

1324
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:55,489
will accelerate dramatically.

1325
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,762
The most vulnerable parts

1326
00:52:56,763 --> 00:52:58,260
of a suspension bridge

1327
00:52:58,295 --> 00:52:59,967
are the steel vertical hanger

1328
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:05,575
cables.

1329
00:53:05,646 --> 00:53:06,347
These have been tested

1330
00:53:06,348 --> 00:53:07,645
in the laboratory,

1331
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,182
unfortunately not on the bridge,

1332
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:10,384
but what you see

1333
00:53:10,385 --> 00:53:13,074
is a classic kind of a failure

1334
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:15,367
that occurs in these wires.

1335
00:53:15,402 --> 00:53:17,625
These are the individual wires,

1336
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:18,166
all right?

1337
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:20,000
that's an individual wire.

1338
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:20,670
That probably has

1339
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:21,437
a tensile strength

1340
00:53:21,472 --> 00:53:23,004
that's maybe 200,000 pounds

1341
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:23,571
per square inch.

1342
00:53:23,606 --> 00:53:24,577
That's a very high strength

1343
00:53:24,578 --> 00:53:26,105
steel.

1344
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,878
As strong as they are,

1345
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:31,087
these cables have a fatal flaw:

1346
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:36,796
it's the stuff they're made of.

1347
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:37,999
Steel is a mineral

1348
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:39,201
that comes from the Earth

1349
00:53:39,236 --> 00:53:40,686
that's mostly iron,

1350
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,136
so it's probably

1351
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:45,141
95, 98 percent iron.

1352
00:53:45,176 --> 00:53:48,145
Exposed to moisture

1353
00:53:48,146 --> 00:53:49,743
in the environment,

1354
00:53:49,778 --> 00:53:51,180
iron will start to revert

1355
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:52,352
back to the minerals

1356
00:53:52,353 --> 00:53:53,955
it came from.

1357
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:57,891
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1358
00:53:57,892 --> 00:53:59,865
It's gonna go back home.

1359
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,531
It came from the Earth

1360
00:54:00,566 --> 00:54:02,940
as iron oxide of some form,

1361
00:54:02,941 --> 00:54:06,040
and it's gonna go back.

1362
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:07,648
This is the process we know

1363
00:54:07,683 --> 00:54:09,410
as corrosion,

1364
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:10,954
and you see it wherever steel

1365
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:13,424
is exposed to moisture.

1366
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,860
The enemy of steel

1367
00:54:15,861 --> 00:54:17,824
is corrosion.

1368
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:18,365
The problem

1369
00:54:18,366 --> 00:54:20,499
is keeping the water out.

1370
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:22,268
Part of that is maintenance.

1371
00:54:22,303 --> 00:54:24,003
If you don't maintain them,

1372
00:54:24,004 --> 00:54:28,581
you will get corrosion.

1373
00:54:28,582 --> 00:54:30,635
Completed in 1883,

1374
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,688
the Brooklyn bridge cost

1375
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:36,661
$15 million to build.

1376
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:38,497
Over the last two decades,

1377
00:54:38,499 --> 00:54:40,862
$3 billion have been spent

1378
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:41,999
maintaining it

1379
00:54:42,034 --> 00:54:43,105
and the other bridges

1380
00:54:43,106 --> 00:54:45,810
over the East river.

1381
00:54:45,811 --> 00:54:47,343
In the time of humans,

1382
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:48,841
the brooklyn bridge

1383
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:50,618
was continually maintained

1384
00:54:50,653 --> 00:54:52,150
and fully repainted,

1385
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:54,119
roughly, every dozen years.

1386
00:54:54,154 --> 00:54:56,087
While across the country

1387
00:54:56,122 --> 00:55:00,594
in San Francisco,

1388
00:55:00,595 --> 00:55:01,866
the Golden Gate bridge

1389
00:55:01,867 --> 00:55:03,940
was protected at all times

1390
00:55:03,975 --> 00:55:05,760
by a vigilant brigade

1391
00:55:05,795 --> 00:55:07,545
of 17 iron workers

1392
00:55:07,546 --> 00:55:12,479
and 38 painters.

1393
00:55:12,514 --> 00:55:13,655
What do they do all the time?

1394
00:55:13,656 --> 00:55:15,724
They will tell you, "we paint

1395
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:17,792
this bridge continuously."

1396
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:19,160
What happens when that stops?

1397
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:20,527
I can tell you what happens

1398
00:55:20,562 --> 00:55:21,698
when that stops.

1399
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:23,572
The cables begin to rust,

1400
00:55:23,607 --> 00:55:24,899
the paint peels off,

1401
00:55:24,934 --> 00:55:26,786
the wires begin to break,

1402
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:28,639
and they'll come to a point

1403
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,311
when the bridge

1404
00:55:29,312 --> 00:55:35,086
is gonna come down.

1405
00:55:35,121 --> 00:55:40,860
Seventy-Five years

1406
00:55:40,895 --> 00:55:43,564
after people.

1407
00:55:43,565 --> 00:55:45,567
Most of the 600 million cars

1408
00:55:45,602 --> 00:55:47,570
that once traveled the roads

1409
00:55:47,571 --> 00:55:49,179
of the world

1410
00:55:49,214 --> 00:55:51,377
are now just rusted remnants

1411
00:55:51,378 --> 00:55:57,522
of the human past.

1412
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:58,689
Abandoned cars will behave

1413
00:55:58,724 --> 00:55:59,690
differently depending

1414
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:00,928
on the environment

1415
00:56:00,963 --> 00:56:02,130
that they're in.

1416
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:03,436
A car left in the Mojave desert,

1417
00:56:03,437 --> 00:56:04,037
for example,

1418
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:06,442
is gonna last a long time.

1419
00:56:06,502 --> 00:56:07,442
A car abandoned

1420
00:56:07,443 --> 00:56:09,005
in my native Scotland

1421
00:56:09,006 --> 00:56:09,612
is gonna have

1422
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:11,650
a very different fate.

1423
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,451
Any cars

1424
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,269
in a coastal environment

1425
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,087
with salt in the atmosphere,

1426
00:56:16,088 --> 00:56:18,942
they might not last

1427
00:56:18,977 --> 00:56:21,797
more than 20, 30 years.

1428
00:56:21,832 --> 00:56:22,767
Tires deflate

1429
00:56:22,768 --> 00:56:24,701
within a few years,

1430
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:25,472
although the rubber

1431
00:56:25,473 --> 00:56:27,075
and synthetics they're made of

1432
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,006
will remain intact

1433
00:56:28,008 --> 00:56:30,947
for centuries.

1434
00:56:30,982 --> 00:56:33,485
Paint deteriorates quickly.

1435
00:56:33,486 --> 00:56:35,604
and once it flakes away,

1436
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:37,722
rust corrodes the car's body

1437
00:56:37,723 --> 00:56:39,525
at a rate of 5,000ths

1438
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:42,496
of an inch per year.

1439
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:45,905
Seventy-Five years after humans,

1440
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:47,003
most cars,

1441
00:56:47,038 --> 00:56:48,339
even in the most forgiving

1442
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,612
of environments,

1443
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:52,817
will be reduced to skeletons.

1444
00:56:52,852 --> 00:56:56,022
After a century, the family car

1445
00:56:56,023 --> 00:56:58,255
is a barely recognizable heap

1446
00:56:58,256 --> 00:57:12,108
of metal.

1447
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:14,783
It's now 100 years into a life

1448
00:57:14,784 --> 00:57:18,755
after people.

1449
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,292
The Brooklyn bridge,

1450
00:57:20,327 --> 00:57:21,063
which had stood

1451
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:24,769
for over 125 years with people,

1452
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:26,773
can't survive even a century

1453
00:57:26,808 --> 00:57:29,442
without them.

1454
00:57:29,477 --> 00:57:31,279
As the cables fail,

1455
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,012
the deck and railings begin

1456
00:57:33,013 --> 00:57:40,394
to warp and sway.

1457
00:57:40,395 --> 00:57:43,900
The deck pulls free,

1458
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:45,603
and the roadway spills

1459
00:57:45,604 --> 00:57:51,263
into the East river.

1460
00:57:51,298 --> 00:57:56,887
as an engineer,

1461
00:57:56,922 --> 00:57:58,854
it's very sad to contemplate

1462
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:00,522
that this beautiful iconic

1463
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:02,190
structure has got an end

1464
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:03,563
to its life.

1465
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,196
But without maintenance,

1466
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,197
an end to its life

1467
00:58:06,198 --> 00:58:12,343
it certainly has.

1468
00:58:12,378 --> 00:58:15,512
How exactly do bridges fail?

1469
00:58:15,513 --> 00:58:18,152
Once corrosion starts,

1470
00:58:18,187 --> 00:58:20,791
the wires begin to crack.

1471
00:58:20,826 --> 00:58:21,287
And the wire

1472
00:58:21,322 --> 00:58:21,892
doesn't have to have

1473
00:58:21,893 --> 00:58:22,909
a very big crack

1474
00:58:22,944 --> 00:58:23,926
before it breaks.

1475
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:25,564
Maybe a third

1476
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,672
of the way through.

1477
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:29,135
You may wonder what happens

1478
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:29,905
when they fail.

1479
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:30,742
How do they fail?

1480
00:58:30,777 --> 00:58:31,578
Do they just break

1481
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:32,440
And what do they do?

1482
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:33,006
And the answer

1483
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:35,785
is they tend to shred and fail,

1484
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:36,917
with individual strands

1485
00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:37,584
starting to fail

1486
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,356
and then, kind of, cascading,

1487
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,094
and a whole series of wires

1488
00:58:41,095 --> 00:58:45,060
then begin to break.

1489
00:58:45,061 --> 00:58:46,102
A suspension bridge

1490
00:58:46,103 --> 00:58:48,136
like the Golden Gate can survive

1491
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:49,737
the weakening of one

1492
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:51,390
of its vertical cables.

1493
00:58:51,425 --> 00:58:53,043
But once two or three

1494
00:58:53,044 --> 00:58:54,446
start to go,

1495
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,882
the whole bridge is in jeopardy.

1496
00:58:57,917 --> 00:59:01,104
Twisted steel crashes

1497
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:03,852
into the waters below.

1498
00:59:03,887 --> 00:59:06,565
It's gonna be gone.

1499
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:07,763
Two hundred years?

1500
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,602
I doubt it will last 200 years.

1501
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:12,074
The bridge is gonna be

1502
00:59:12,075 --> 00:59:13,447
in the drink.

1503
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:15,850
If some

1504
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,153
of our largest structures

1505
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:18,415
have already failed

1506
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:21,460
after 100 years,

1507
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:22,692
can there be any hope

1508
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:23,924
that our civilization

1509
00:59:23,925 --> 00:59:25,567
will leave a permanent mark

1510
00:59:25,602 --> 00:59:29,839
after we're gone?

1511
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:31,436
What will remain of the records

1512
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:33,579
of our history and culture

1513
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:38,488
a hundred years after people?

1514
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:39,850
Our vaults contain

1515
00:59:39,851 --> 00:59:41,753
our most precious materials,

1516
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:43,656
and their biggest enemies

1517
00:59:43,657 --> 00:59:49,136
are temperature and humidity.

1518
00:59:49,171 --> 00:59:49,732
As long

1519
00:59:49,767 --> 00:59:51,770
as their long-term storage

1520
00:59:51,805 --> 00:59:52,911
is kept at these

1521
00:59:52,912 --> 00:59:55,947
very controlled settings,

1522
00:59:55,982 --> 00:59:57,018
we feel assured

1523
00:59:57,019 --> 00:59:58,045
that the materials

1524
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:04,460
will be lasting a long time.

1525
01:00:04,495 --> 01:00:05,631
Stored

1526
01:00:05,632 --> 01:00:07,194
under ideal conditions,

1527
01:00:07,195 --> 01:00:08,967
paper and film both have

1528
01:00:09,002 --> 01:00:10,740
an estimated shelf life

1529
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:14,907
of 200 to 300 years.

1530
01:00:14,908 --> 01:00:16,845
But expose them to the rigors

1531
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,783
of an uncontrolled environment

1532
01:00:18,784 --> 01:00:20,657
and that lifespan is cut

1533
01:00:20,692 --> 01:00:24,593
at least in half.

1534
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:29,171
If all the power went off,

1535
01:00:29,206 --> 01:00:30,372
probably within a week,

1536
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:32,636
we'd see very big spikes

1537
01:00:32,777 --> 01:00:36,833
in the temperature and humidity.

1538
01:00:36,868 --> 01:00:40,889
In this hostile environment,

1539
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,652
cellulose acetate,

1540
01:00:42,653 --> 01:00:43,860
the most common material

1541
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:46,028
used for films and photographs

1542
01:00:46,029 --> 01:00:49,203
throughout the 20th century

1543
01:00:49,204 --> 01:00:53,205
begins to bubble and warp.

1544
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,343
All of that culture and history,

1545
01:00:55,344 --> 01:00:57,317
from the landings on d-day

1546
01:00:57,352 --> 01:00:58,814
to hollywood films

1547
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:00,020
and even your cherished

1548
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:02,025
home movies and photographs,

1549
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,687
won't last a century

1550
01:01:03,688 --> 01:01:06,693
without the care of humans.

1551
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:09,698
So, those precious images,

1552
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:11,605
given time,

1553
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,845
are going to end up like this.

1554
01:01:14,846 --> 01:01:16,012
All of these are examples

1555
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:19,116
of various stages in the decay

1556
01:01:19,151 --> 01:01:22,186
of cellulose acetate-based film

1557
01:01:22,187 --> 01:01:23,689
exposed to very high amounts

1558
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,522
of humidity.

1559
01:01:25,523 --> 01:01:26,459
Essentially,

1560
01:01:26,494 --> 01:01:33,074
these materials are finished.

1561
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:34,707
In libraries,

1562
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,105
the great repositories

1563
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,283
of our collective knowledge,

1564
01:01:38,284 --> 01:01:39,311
the damage comes

1565
01:01:39,346 --> 01:01:43,372
from microscopic invaders.

1566
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:47,398
Although we can't see them,

1567
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:48,500
mold spores

1568
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:50,503
are on all the surfaces

1569
01:01:50,538 --> 01:01:52,506
around us, lying dormant,

1570
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:53,804
biding their time

1571
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,271
for the right conditions

1572
01:01:55,272 --> 01:02:00,019
to strike.

1573
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,286
High humidity

1574
01:02:01,321 --> 01:02:05,056
creates the right conditions.

1575
01:02:05,057 --> 01:02:05,854
and so,

1576
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,862
the situation is set up

1577
01:02:07,863 --> 01:02:12,970
for the mold to really boom.

1578
01:02:13,005 --> 01:02:18,078
some books and documents

1579
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,567
will avoid this fate.

1580
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:23,056
The Dead Sea scrolls

1581
01:02:23,057 --> 01:02:25,461
survived 2,000 years in caves

1582
01:02:25,496 --> 01:02:26,960
in the Judean desert,

1583
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:28,425
owing their longevity

1584
01:02:28,426 --> 01:02:29,833
to the arid climate

1585
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:33,989
and lack of damaging sunlight.

1586
01:02:34,024 --> 01:02:38,110
But these are rare exceptions.

1587
01:02:38,111 --> 01:02:38,682
So without

1588
01:02:38,683 --> 01:02:40,210
human intervention,

1589
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:41,747
a book like this might last,

1590
01:02:41,748 --> 01:02:47,897
at best, another hundred years.

1591
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:57,172
Even our digital media

1592
01:02:57,173 --> 01:03:00,548
won't last forever.

1593
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:01,750
Estimates for the lifespan

1594
01:03:01,785 --> 01:03:04,454
of cds and dvds range

1595
01:03:04,455 --> 01:03:05,891
from a few decades

1596
01:03:05,926 --> 01:03:07,328
to a few centuries

1597
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:11,295
under ideal conditions.

1598
01:03:11,296 --> 01:03:11,631
We know

1599
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:12,867
about the ancient egyptians

1600
01:03:12,868 --> 01:03:14,942
because what they left behind

1601
01:03:14,977 --> 01:03:16,404
was engraved in stones.

1602
01:03:20,812 --> 01:03:23,315
Our form of capturing knowledge,

1603
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:24,817
information, our history,

1604
01:03:24,818 --> 01:03:26,505
our advancement is typically

1605
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,193
either in a computerized form,

1606
01:03:28,194 --> 01:03:30,628
in a cd, or in a printed paper

1607
01:03:30,663 --> 01:03:32,029
like this.

1608
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,271
What we have here is something

1609
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:34,874
that will degrade over time.

1610
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:36,406
It will not last

1611
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:37,538
for thousands of years

1612
01:03:37,573 --> 01:03:38,179
like what

1613
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,211
the ancient egyptians

1614
01:03:39,246 --> 01:03:41,544
left behind.

1615
01:03:41,545 --> 01:03:44,389
It seems pretty ironic

1616
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:47,655
that with all of our advances,

1617
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:49,428
we still have not come up

1618
01:03:49,463 --> 01:03:51,200
with anything as durable

1619
01:03:51,201 --> 01:03:56,309
as clay tablets and stone tools.

1620
01:04:04,082 --> 01:04:08,359
150 years after humans,

1621
01:04:08,394 --> 01:04:09,129
the subways

1622
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:11,383
that had started to flood

1623
01:04:11,418 --> 01:04:13,637
in the first 36 hours

1624
01:04:13,672 --> 01:04:14,438
are now flowing

1625
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:18,144
subterranean streams.

1626
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,462
The beams and archways

1627
01:04:19,497 --> 01:04:20,779
that hold up the roofs

1628
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,246
of these tunnels

1629
01:04:22,281 --> 01:04:25,986
are on the verge of collapse.

1630
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:26,688
now, these tunnels

1631
01:04:26,689 --> 01:04:28,722
are not far below street level.

1632
01:04:28,723 --> 01:04:30,625
These columns are supporting

1633
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,528
not just the roof of the tunnel,

1634
01:04:32,563 --> 01:04:34,371
but the street above.

1635
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:35,834
And in time that these tunnels

1636
01:04:35,869 --> 01:04:37,105
are inundated,

1637
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,172
flooded with water,

1638
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,238
corrosion will start

1639
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,812
to take hold and we'll start

1640
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:44,187
to see collapses.

1641
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:45,189
The tunnels echo

1642
01:04:45,224 --> 01:04:46,020
with the sound

1643
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:49,756
of cracking steel and cement

1644
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:54,764
as the streets above

1645
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:57,408
are sucked into the underground.

1646
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:08,426
Above ground, life in the city

1647
01:05:08,427 --> 01:05:13,134
is once again bustling.

1648
01:05:13,135 --> 01:05:15,453
Vines have grown up the sides

1649
01:05:15,488 --> 01:05:17,771
of abandoned skyscrapers,

1650
01:05:17,773 --> 01:05:19,976
adapting to feed off rainwater

1651
01:05:20,011 --> 01:05:22,149
that pools in crevices

1652
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:26,616
and on ledges.

1653
01:05:26,617 --> 01:05:28,259
These vines all start up.

1654
01:05:28,294 --> 01:05:29,160
and the vines

1655
01:05:29,161 --> 01:05:30,323
have little branches.

1656
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:30,863
It'd be nice

1657
01:05:30,864 --> 01:05:32,061
if they produce a fruit

1658
01:05:32,096 --> 01:05:34,399
or something that was edible.

1659
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:35,296
You gotta have a plant

1660
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,234
with some fruit or, you know,

1661
01:05:37,235 --> 01:05:38,936
some source of energy

1662
01:05:38,971 --> 01:05:40,879
for animals.

1663
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:42,813
And then you would get

1664
01:05:42,848 --> 01:05:44,616
this vertical ecosystem

1665
01:05:44,617 --> 01:05:46,384
out there, and you would get

1666
01:05:46,419 --> 01:05:48,151
birds nesting in there.

1667
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:48,722
You get things

1668
01:05:48,723 --> 01:05:50,174
hunting in through there.

1669
01:05:50,209 --> 01:05:51,626
You could have snakes there.

1670
01:05:51,627 --> 01:05:52,098
You could have

1671
01:05:52,099 --> 01:06:00,643
all kinds of things.

1672
01:06:00,678 --> 01:06:01,478
As insects

1673
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:02,445
and smaller animals

1674
01:06:02,446 --> 01:06:07,403
get established,

1675
01:06:07,438 --> 01:06:12,361
cats move in.

1676
01:06:12,362 --> 01:06:13,028
And there's some

1677
01:06:13,063 --> 01:06:14,394
interesting examples of that

1678
01:06:14,395 --> 01:06:16,533
around the world.

1679
01:06:16,568 --> 01:06:17,800
If you go to the colosseum--

1680
01:06:17,835 --> 01:06:18,701
you just look in it--

1681
01:06:18,702 --> 01:06:21,807
it's just loaded with cats.

1682
01:06:21,842 --> 01:06:22,747
And the old tombs

1683
01:06:22,748 --> 01:06:24,410
and old catacombs and so on

1684
01:06:24,411 --> 01:06:25,783
get loaded with cats

1685
01:06:25,784 --> 01:06:27,185
that use this as a living space

1686
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:27,886
from which, then,

1687
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:32,795
they radiate out during the day.

1688
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:33,896
these felines

1689
01:06:33,897 --> 01:06:34,868
are the descendants

1690
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:36,801
of our former house cats.

1691
01:06:36,836 --> 01:06:38,756
Immediately after people

1692
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,677
were gone, they replaced

1693
01:06:40,678 --> 01:06:42,606
their human-supplied diets

1694
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:45,946
with field mice and small birds.

1695
01:06:45,947 --> 01:06:47,318
Hunting out in the open

1696
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:49,356
was hard work.

1697
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:51,394
But up here,

1698
01:06:51,395 --> 01:06:55,301
the pickings are easy.

1699
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,603
Now, they live

1700
01:06:56,604 --> 01:06:58,271
their whole lives

1701
01:06:58,306 --> 01:06:59,904
high above the city,

1702
01:06:59,939 --> 01:07:01,271
finding all that they need

1703
01:07:01,272 --> 01:07:03,615
to survive without ever having

1704
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:05,550
to touch the ground.

1705
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:07,450
They are the kings

1706
01:07:07,452 --> 01:07:09,053
of the new high altitude

1707
01:07:09,054 --> 01:07:10,321
food chain,

1708
01:07:10,356 --> 01:07:12,158
with million-dollar views

1709
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:13,090
of a bizarrely

1710
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:22,872
altered cityscape.

1711
01:07:22,907 --> 01:07:24,378
I could picture New York city

1712
01:07:24,379 --> 01:07:26,282
with all the buildings

1713
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:29,057
covered with vines, you know?

1714
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:32,461
Hawks sailing around.

1715
01:07:32,462 --> 01:07:33,764
it'd be lovely.

1716
01:07:33,765 --> 01:07:35,597
It would be absolutely lovely.

1717
01:07:38,903 --> 01:07:40,374
For cats,

1718
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:42,408
life in this new environment

1719
01:07:42,409 --> 01:07:43,680
could eventually lead

1720
01:07:43,681 --> 01:07:48,348
to some strange adaptations.

1721
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:49,400
I suppose, if you wanted

1722
01:07:49,435 --> 01:07:50,451
to be really imaginative

1723
01:07:50,452 --> 01:07:52,239
about it, you could say that,

1724
01:07:52,274 --> 01:07:54,027
eventually, they could be

1725
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,830
like flying squirrels and so on.

1726
01:07:55,831 --> 01:07:59,636
They could glide from places.

1727
01:07:59,637 --> 01:08:02,991
The possibility is always there

1728
01:08:03,026 --> 01:08:06,346
for some imaginative responses

1729
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:12,727
to this unusual environment.

1730
01:08:12,729 --> 01:08:13,725
While some cats

1731
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,267
have made a great leap forward,

1732
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,335
many dogs have reverted

1733
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:24,206
to the ways of their ancestors.

1734
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:26,275
Some that have interbred

1735
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:29,615
with wolves now fall in packs

1736
01:08:29,616 --> 01:08:32,761
to bring down larger prey.

1737
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:42,942
I think our dogs,

1738
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:44,579
as placid as they may seem

1739
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,707
when they're in our homes

1740
01:08:45,742 --> 01:08:47,785
lying on the living room floor,

1741
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,119
still posses the instinct

1742
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,456
to survive,

1743
01:08:51,491 --> 01:08:53,253
enough that they would be able

1744
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,698
to do whatever it took

1745
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:57,366
in bringing down prey

1746
01:08:57,401 --> 01:08:59,034
in order to live.

1747
01:09:11,224 --> 01:09:17,794
150 years after people,

1748
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:19,196
the oceans are teeming

1749
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:23,673
with life.

1750
01:09:23,674 --> 01:09:25,076
The creatures of the sea

1751
01:09:25,111 --> 01:09:25,907
have welcomed

1752
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:30,015
the disappearance of mankind.

1753
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:30,881
Historically,

1754
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:31,716
we've treated the oceans

1755
01:09:31,717 --> 01:09:33,490
in two strange ways

1756
01:09:33,525 --> 01:09:35,228
at the same time:

1757
01:09:35,263 --> 01:09:39,270
a pantry and a toilet.

1758
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:41,238
and over time,

1759
01:09:41,273 --> 01:09:45,294
our ability to damage the ocean

1760
01:09:45,329 --> 01:09:49,315
has grown and grown and grown.

1761
01:09:49,446 --> 01:09:51,189
With humans no longer fishing

1762
01:09:51,224 --> 01:09:53,021
and polluting the sea,

1763
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,193
the path was cleared

1764
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,728
for this astonishing recovery.

1765
01:09:56,763 --> 01:09:59,214
It has happened before.

1766
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:01,665
during World War II,

1767
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:03,789
allied fishing trawlers

1768
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,912
avoided the North Atlantic,

1769
01:10:05,913 --> 01:10:07,476
and populations of fish there

1770
01:10:07,511 --> 01:10:12,148
skyrocketed.

1771
01:10:12,183 --> 01:10:13,985
In here, the basic biology

1772
01:10:13,986 --> 01:10:15,057
of these kinds of animals

1773
01:10:15,058 --> 01:10:16,189
is working in our favor

1774
01:10:16,224 --> 01:10:17,258
because animals

1775
01:10:17,293 --> 01:10:18,078
like this sunfish

1776
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:18,863
can produce millions

1777
01:10:18,864 --> 01:10:21,468
of offspring in a year,

1778
01:10:21,503 --> 01:10:22,299
much more

1779
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:23,206
than an equivalent-sized

1780
01:10:23,241 --> 01:10:26,005
terrestrial animal like a cow.

1781
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:26,806
And because of that

1782
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:28,049
prodigious potential

1783
01:10:28,084 --> 01:10:29,651
to reproduce,

1784
01:10:29,652 --> 01:10:31,254
the oceans could come back

1785
01:10:31,255 --> 01:10:32,521
pretty quickly

1786
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:34,519
if the human population

1787
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:40,870
were suddenly to disappear.

1788
01:10:40,905 --> 01:10:42,031
Research has shown

1789
01:10:42,032 --> 01:10:43,775
that in the 18th century,

1790
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:45,024
before the havoc

1791
01:10:45,059 --> 01:10:46,238
caused by humans,

1792
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:47,340
the oceans were capable

1793
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,141
of sustaining

1794
01:10:48,142 --> 01:10:52,589
massive amounts of life.

1795
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:53,415
So many whales

1796
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:56,424
that they stink up the air;

1797
01:10:56,425 --> 01:10:57,657
so many tunas

1798
01:10:57,658 --> 01:10:59,531
that they froth the ocean;

1799
01:10:59,566 --> 01:11:00,264
so many turtles

1800
01:11:00,299 --> 01:11:00,928
that you could walk

1801
01:11:00,963 --> 01:11:03,406
across the sea on their backs.

1802
01:11:03,407 --> 01:11:05,539
So, if people were to vanish

1803
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,742
off the face of the Earth,

1804
01:11:06,743 --> 01:11:08,475
then that's the kind of ocean

1805
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:14,485
It could be.

1806
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,062
Seagulls are also

1807
01:11:19,063 --> 01:11:21,036
flourishing, but it has been

1808
01:11:21,071 --> 01:11:23,499
a treacherous flight.

1809
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,671
The abundance of food

1810
01:11:24,672 --> 01:11:25,307
from humans

1811
01:11:25,342 --> 01:11:26,944
had allowed gull populations

1812
01:11:26,945 --> 01:11:28,978
to explode beyond what nature

1813
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:33,286
could normally support.

1814
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:33,751
We humans

1815
01:11:33,786 --> 01:11:35,718
are pretty messy species.

1816
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:37,521
And for a very long time,

1817
01:11:37,523 --> 01:11:39,395
we had open landfill dumps

1818
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,397
where, as far

1819
01:11:40,398 --> 01:11:41,229
as we were concerned,

1820
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:41,694
all the stuff

1821
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:43,031
that wasn't fit to eat

1822
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,233
was just thrown out.

1823
01:11:44,268 --> 01:11:45,435
But from the gulls'

1824
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:46,106
point of view,

1825
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:47,344
this was an amazing

1826
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:48,581
free lunch counter.

1827
01:11:48,641 --> 01:11:49,842
So, you had a lot of birds

1828
01:11:49,877 --> 01:11:50,343
that probably

1829
01:11:50,344 --> 01:11:51,245
wouldn't have made it through

1830
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:51,963
their first winter

1831
01:11:51,998 --> 01:11:52,646
if they've had to feed

1832
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:53,568
for themselves.

1833
01:11:53,603 --> 01:11:54,489
Suddenly, they had

1834
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:56,157
all these free food

1835
01:11:56,192 --> 01:11:57,825
available to them.

1836
01:11:57,956 --> 01:11:59,107
An immediate consequence

1837
01:11:59,142 --> 01:12:00,259
of a world without people

1838
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,631
would be some very hungry gulls

1839
01:12:01,632 --> 01:12:04,786
who would be very voraciously

1840
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,941
looking for other things to eat.

1841
01:12:07,942 --> 01:12:11,377
After an initial die-Off,

1842
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:12,518
the remaining gulls

1843
01:12:12,519 --> 01:12:13,520
took advantage

1844
01:12:13,521 --> 01:12:15,424
of the recovering oceans,

1845
01:12:15,425 --> 01:12:16,987
where plentiful schools of fish

1846
01:12:17,022 --> 01:12:18,729
erased any memories

1847
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:20,963
of the human-manufactured feasts

1848
01:12:20,998 --> 01:12:29,005
they used to enjoy.

1849
01:12:29,006 --> 01:12:32,752
Two hundred years after people,

1850
01:12:32,753 --> 01:12:35,587
from New York to Chicago,

1851
01:12:35,622 --> 01:12:37,986
Seattle and Paris,

1852
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:39,929
our iron and steel icons

1853
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:45,472
are on the verge of collapse.

1854
01:12:45,473 --> 01:12:46,700
While it has outlived

1855
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:49,078
our great suspension bridges,

1856
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:50,281
the Eiffel tower

1857
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:52,199
is not invincible.

1858
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:53,861
In the time of humans,

1859
01:12:53,896 --> 01:12:55,488
its iron superstructure

1860
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:56,221
was painted

1861
01:12:56,222 --> 01:12:57,919
once every seven years

1862
01:12:57,954 --> 01:13:02,430
to protect it from corrosion.

1863
01:13:02,432 --> 01:13:04,735
In both age and structure,

1864
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:05,919
the Eiffel tower

1865
01:13:05,954 --> 01:13:07,068
has a lot in common

1866
01:13:07,069 --> 01:13:08,440
with the 300-foot high

1867
01:13:08,441 --> 01:13:10,414
Kinzua railroad viaduct

1868
01:13:10,449 --> 01:13:12,347
in Pennsylvania.

1869
01:13:12,348 --> 01:13:12,813
Was a bridge

1870
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:13,419
that was wrought iron

1871
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:14,516
originally.

1872
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:15,547
It was reconstructed

1873
01:13:15,582 --> 01:13:16,523
about the turn of the century

1874
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:18,857
in steel.

1875
01:13:18,928 --> 01:13:20,229
And what happens here of course

1876
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,634
is that unless it's maintained,

1877
01:13:22,669 --> 01:13:23,896
corrosion occurs.

1878
01:13:23,897 --> 01:13:25,168
And what happens

1879
01:13:25,203 --> 01:13:26,439
with the corrosion?

1880
01:13:26,571 --> 01:13:30,075
The connection points freeze up.

1881
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:32,850
They are not allowed to move.

1882
01:13:32,885 --> 01:13:33,611
and here are some pieces

1883
01:13:33,612 --> 01:13:34,783
from that viaduct.

1884
01:13:34,784 --> 01:13:35,380
You can see

1885
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:36,155
that there's corrosion

1886
01:13:36,156 --> 01:13:37,588
all over the place.

1887
01:13:37,589 --> 01:13:41,665
That's no longer steel.

1888
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:42,261
a structure

1889
01:13:42,296 --> 01:13:44,128
with frozen connection points

1890
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:45,731
can't absorb the stress

1891
01:13:45,732 --> 01:13:47,654
of high winds.

1892
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,577
Eventually,

1893
01:13:49,578 --> 01:13:53,434
in this strong wind storm,

1894
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:57,290
it literally fell over.

1895
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:59,053
Section by section,

1896
01:13:59,054 --> 01:14:00,261
piece by piece,

1897
01:14:00,296 --> 01:14:02,364
it fell over into the valley

1898
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:04,432
where it had spanned the valley

1899
01:14:04,467 --> 01:14:10,111
for over a hundred years.

1900
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:13,943
Just not maintained.

1901
01:14:13,978 --> 01:14:15,279
you can think of many structures

1902
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,151
that are coming

1903
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:17,022
from that same era

1904
01:14:17,023 --> 01:14:18,275
like the Eiffel tower,

1905
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,319
its iconic structure.

1906
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,328
That doesn't shield it

1907
01:14:20,329 --> 01:14:21,830
from the fact that's it

1908
01:14:21,831 --> 01:14:25,467
in a corrosive environment.

1909
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:27,068
And so in time

1910
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:28,701
if you do not do anything

1911
01:14:28,702 --> 01:14:29,904
for that structure,

1912
01:14:29,939 --> 01:14:34,080
it will fail.

1913
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:47,637
and it will come down.

1914
01:14:47,672 --> 01:15:01,194
The time between one

1915
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:03,414
and 300 years after people

1916
01:15:03,449 --> 01:15:05,632
will likely be the era

1917
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:06,934
of the great collapses

1918
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,838
worldwide.

1919
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,136
In Seattle,

1920
01:15:11,171 --> 01:15:12,542
the iconic Space Needle

1921
01:15:12,543 --> 01:15:13,714
was designed to sway

1922
01:15:13,716 --> 01:15:15,878
one inch for every 10 miles

1923
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:17,216
per hour of wind,

1924
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:18,853
but with its steel

1925
01:15:18,888 --> 01:15:20,455
weakened by corrosion,

1926
01:15:20,456 --> 01:15:21,457
it takes little more

1927
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:22,830
than a strong breeze

1928
01:15:22,831 --> 01:15:23,697
for the symbol

1929
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:26,331
of the 1962 world's fair

1930
01:15:26,366 --> 01:15:46,929
to crash down from the skyline.

1931
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:48,432
When humans disappeared,

1932
01:15:48,467 --> 01:15:49,935
sea levels were already

1933
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:53,680
on the rise.

1934
01:15:53,681 --> 01:15:54,608
In Manhattan,

1935
01:15:54,643 --> 01:15:55,985
over the centuries,

1936
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,412
saturated soil

1937
01:15:57,447 --> 01:15:58,588
around the Empire State

1938
01:15:58,589 --> 01:16:00,721
building's foundation pilings

1939
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:01,894
have allowed the building

1940
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:03,056
to lean.

1941
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:04,628
Once a building strays

1942
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:05,630
from the vertical,

1943
01:16:05,631 --> 01:16:06,847
then gravity forces

1944
01:16:06,882 --> 01:16:08,064
are also acting

1945
01:16:08,065 --> 01:16:09,186
against the structure,

1946
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:10,273
increasing the stresses

1947
01:16:10,308 --> 01:16:11,890
at the base of the building,

1948
01:16:11,925 --> 01:16:13,473
now we're unlikely to see

1949
01:16:13,508 --> 01:16:14,774
a skyscraper fall

1950
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:17,279
like a tree in the forest.

1951
01:16:17,314 --> 01:16:19,783
Once it does start to incline,

1952
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,586
gravitational force will cause

1953
01:16:21,621 --> 01:16:23,128
the top of the building

1954
01:16:23,129 --> 01:16:24,812
to collapse downward

1955
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:26,495
on top of itself.

1956
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,773
Decay has also overtaken

1957
01:16:31,808 --> 01:16:33,746
the city of Chicago,

1958
01:16:33,781 --> 01:16:34,547
the birthplace

1959
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,667
of the skyscraper.

1960
01:16:37,702 --> 01:16:40,787
The Sears tower,

1961
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:42,220
the tallest man-made structure

1962
01:16:42,255 --> 01:16:43,822
in North America,

1963
01:16:43,823 --> 01:16:44,363
has reached

1964
01:16:44,364 --> 01:16:48,270
the end of its reign.

1965
01:17:08,303 --> 01:17:09,705
The first 500 years

1966
01:17:09,706 --> 01:17:15,364
after people has been an era

1967
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:18,892
of decay and destruction.

1968
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:22,385
Our concrete structures

1969
01:17:22,386 --> 01:17:25,561
have lasted the longest.

1970
01:17:25,596 --> 01:17:26,662
The ancient romans

1971
01:17:26,663 --> 01:17:27,864
invented the first form

1972
01:17:27,865 --> 01:17:30,564
of concrete.

1973
01:17:30,599 --> 01:17:31,801
And some of their structures

1974
01:17:31,836 --> 01:17:32,942
remained intact

1975
01:17:32,943 --> 01:17:35,727
for over 2,000 years.

1976
01:17:35,762 --> 01:17:38,511
But modern concrete

1977
01:17:38,512 --> 01:17:40,450
isn't nearly as durable.

1978
01:17:40,485 --> 01:17:42,518
It has a higher water content

1979
01:17:42,519 --> 01:17:44,462
and is more loosely packed,

1980
01:17:44,497 --> 01:17:45,393
which leads to more

1981
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,581
air pockets and cracks.

1982
01:17:47,616 --> 01:17:49,769
Modern concrete structures

1983
01:17:49,771 --> 01:17:52,975
have another fatal flaw.

1984
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:53,676
Below the surface

1985
01:17:53,677 --> 01:17:54,237
of reinforced

1986
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:55,439
concrete structures,

1987
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:56,581
there is a mesh

1988
01:17:56,582 --> 01:17:58,384
of steel reinforcing bars

1989
01:17:58,419 --> 01:18:00,152
and they don't corrode

1990
01:18:00,187 --> 01:18:02,120
because the concrete maintains

1991
01:18:02,251 --> 01:18:03,593
an alkaline environment

1992
01:18:03,628 --> 01:18:04,720
around them.

1993
01:18:04,755 --> 01:18:06,197
Now, when that alkalinity

1994
01:18:06,232 --> 01:18:07,258
breaks down,

1995
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,631
as it will in time,

1996
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:09,362
then the steel

1997
01:18:09,363 --> 01:18:13,474
will start to corrode.

1998
01:18:13,509 --> 01:18:15,411
As the steel rebar rusts,

1999
01:18:15,412 --> 01:18:17,516
it expands to three times

2000
01:18:17,551 --> 01:18:19,318
its original volume

2001
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:20,881
creating an outward pressure

2002
01:18:20,882 --> 01:18:22,353
that causes the concrete

2003
01:18:22,388 --> 01:18:30,266
to crumble.

2004
01:18:30,267 --> 01:18:31,298
In very broad terms,

2005
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:32,369
after 50 years

2006
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:33,066
we'd start to see

2007
01:18:33,101 --> 01:18:35,345
surface cracking on concrete.

2008
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:36,876
after a hundred years,

2009
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,981
flaking of the concrete surface.

2010
01:18:39,016 --> 01:18:40,613
after maybe 500 years,

2011
01:18:40,614 --> 01:18:41,555
most reinforced

2012
01:18:41,556 --> 01:18:42,787
concrete structures

2013
01:18:42,822 --> 01:18:46,728
will be gone.

2014
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:47,865
We look at these images

2015
01:18:47,866 --> 01:18:51,686
of our fallen civilization,

2016
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:55,507
it helps us to identify

2017
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:56,609
with the past,

2018
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:58,312
with the greeks and the romans,

2019
01:18:58,313 --> 01:19:00,045
with the crumbled

2020
01:19:00,046 --> 01:19:02,449
mud brick cities of ur.

2021
01:19:02,519 --> 01:19:03,205
Each of us knows

2022
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:03,891
that our bodies

2023
01:19:03,892 --> 01:19:07,878
are going to fall apart;

2024
01:19:07,913 --> 01:19:11,864
why not our cities too?

2025
01:19:16,772 --> 01:19:18,695
A thousand years ago,

2026
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:20,618
61/2 billion people

2027
01:19:20,619 --> 01:19:23,789
called this planet home.

2028
01:19:23,824 --> 01:19:26,959
At the early 21st century,

2029
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,961
more than half of them

2030
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:32,199
lived in cities.

2031
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:36,403
Now those cities

2032
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:40,576
are unrecognizable.

2033
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:42,013
After maybe a thousand years

2034
01:19:42,014 --> 01:19:43,716
or so, the scene behind me

2035
01:19:43,717 --> 01:19:45,519
would be very, very different.

2036
01:19:45,554 --> 01:19:47,322
There'll be very little evidence

2037
01:19:47,323 --> 01:19:49,591
of buildings,

2038
01:19:49,626 --> 01:19:50,497
very little evidence

2039
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:52,200
of the activities of man.

2040
01:19:52,235 --> 01:19:53,131
What we would see

2041
01:19:53,132 --> 01:19:57,078
would be a jungle of vegetation.

2042
01:19:57,113 --> 01:19:58,613
The future of cities

2043
01:19:58,648 --> 01:20:00,113
in a life after people

2044
01:20:00,114 --> 01:20:02,583
can be best imagined

2045
01:20:02,618 --> 01:20:05,052
by looking to the past.

2046
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:06,573
This is Minetta Street

2047
01:20:06,608 --> 01:20:08,026
in Greenwich village.

2048
01:20:08,027 --> 01:20:09,098
Most New Yorkers might come here

2049
01:20:09,133 --> 01:20:10,129
and wonder why it curves

2050
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:11,396
like this.

2051
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:12,663
It curves

2052
01:20:12,664 --> 01:20:13,835
because once upon a time

2053
01:20:13,836 --> 01:20:14,968
there was a stream here,

2054
01:20:15,003 --> 01:20:16,439
and then a brook.

2055
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,572
There were more than 40 streams

2056
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:22,980
on Manhattan island.

2057
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:31,359
All flowing down

2058
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:32,696
and carrying the rainwater

2059
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:35,440
down to the sea.

2060
01:20:35,441 --> 01:20:36,608
So what happens today,

2061
01:20:36,643 --> 01:20:38,846
the rain falls, the snow melts,

2062
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:39,443
but it flows

2063
01:20:39,478 --> 01:20:40,845
right along the street

2064
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,051
and down into that storm drain

2065
01:20:42,052 --> 01:20:43,414
there.

2066
01:20:43,415 --> 01:20:44,451
If there weren't people here

2067
01:20:44,486 --> 01:20:45,487
anymore, there'll be no one here

2068
01:20:45,488 --> 01:20:46,904
to maintain the sidewalks

2069
01:20:46,939 --> 01:20:48,321
and maintain the streets.

2070
01:20:48,322 --> 01:20:49,794
They'd start to crumble up.

2071
01:20:49,795 --> 01:20:51,527
They'd start to break apart.

2072
01:20:51,528 --> 01:20:52,468
Trees would come back,

2073
01:20:52,469 --> 01:20:53,731
vegetation would come back,

2074
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:54,236
and eventually

2075
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:55,503
the hydrological cycle

2076
01:20:55,504 --> 01:20:57,006
would reestablish itself.

2077
01:20:57,007 --> 01:20:57,873
And who knows,

2078
01:20:57,908 --> 01:20:59,440
maybe Minetta Street

2079
01:20:59,441 --> 01:21:00,376
might once again

2080
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:03,546
become Minetta Brook.

2081
01:21:03,547 --> 01:21:05,134
Using historic maps

2082
01:21:05,169 --> 01:21:06,722
and computer modeling,

2083
01:21:06,723 --> 01:21:07,759
scientists

2084
01:21:07,794 --> 01:21:09,095
with the Manhattan project

2085
01:21:09,096 --> 01:21:10,858
are rediscovering

2086
01:21:10,859 --> 01:21:12,431
what Manhattan island

2087
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:14,003
looked like when explorer

2088
01:21:14,005 --> 01:21:18,140
Henry Hudson first sailed

2089
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:22,276
around its shores in 1609.

2090
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:23,979
Here we are in Foley Square,

2091
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:24,821
the administrative center

2092
01:21:24,822 --> 01:21:26,053
of New York city

2093
01:21:26,054 --> 01:21:28,222
and location to the famous

2094
01:21:28,257 --> 01:21:30,390
courthouses you see on TV.

2095
01:21:30,391 --> 01:21:31,462
This place hasn't always had

2096
01:21:31,497 --> 01:21:32,694
such colossal buildings

2097
01:21:32,695 --> 01:21:34,397
and stony streets.

2098
01:21:34,398 --> 01:21:36,501
Once upon a time, 400 years ago,

2099
01:21:36,536 --> 01:21:37,772
the collect pond was here,

2100
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:38,824
the freshwater source

2101
01:21:38,859 --> 01:21:39,876
for New York city.

2102
01:21:39,877 --> 01:21:41,248
Right behind me,

2103
01:21:41,249 --> 01:21:43,101
there was a stream that drained

2104
01:21:43,136 --> 01:21:44,954
down to the Hudson river shore,

2105
01:21:44,989 --> 01:21:45,514
another stream

2106
01:21:45,515 --> 01:21:46,987
to the East river.

2107
01:21:46,988 --> 01:21:47,584
And there was

2108
01:21:47,619 --> 01:21:48,259
this beautiful pond

2109
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:48,826
that was nestled

2110
01:21:48,861 --> 01:21:51,294
in an amphitheater of hills.

2111
01:21:51,329 --> 01:21:52,296
So what would happen

2112
01:21:52,297 --> 01:21:55,016
if all the people

2113
01:21:55,051 --> 01:21:57,735
were to disappear?

2114
01:21:57,736 --> 01:21:58,171
The buildings,

2115
01:21:58,206 --> 01:21:59,508
they would tumble down.

2116
01:21:59,509 --> 01:22:01,111
The soil would start to reform.

2117
01:22:01,146 --> 01:22:01,981
trees would start to grow

2118
01:22:01,982 --> 01:22:02,883
out of them.

2119
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,616
They would become the new hills,

2120
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:06,887
the new amphitheater

2121
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:09,123
around this place.

2122
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,562
Nature would reestablish itself

2123
01:22:10,597 --> 01:22:12,164
and slowly bring this place

2124
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:13,731
back into the green heart

2125
01:22:13,732 --> 01:22:15,364
of what it means to be here

2126
01:22:15,365 --> 01:22:21,359
on planet Earth.

2127
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:27,319
New York city,

2128
01:22:27,354 --> 01:22:29,127
like the rest of the planet,

2129
01:22:29,162 --> 01:22:43,209
has changed radically.

2130
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:44,251
The transformation

2131
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:47,687
is most shocking in Times Square

2132
01:22:47,722 --> 01:22:48,758
as the once beating

2133
01:22:48,759 --> 01:22:51,363
heart of the city is silenced

2134
01:22:51,398 --> 01:23:26,249
by nature's onslaught.

2135
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:30,657
It's 10,000 years after people.

2136
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:34,463
Could it be possible

2137
01:23:34,498 --> 01:23:36,233
after only 10 millennia

2138
01:23:36,268 --> 01:23:37,968
that humanity has vanished

2139
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:49,056
without a trace?

2140
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,090
Human scientists once predicted

2141
01:23:51,091 --> 01:23:52,793
that our history and culture

2142
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:54,496
would live on through our radio

2143
01:23:54,497 --> 01:23:56,931
and television broadcasts,

2144
01:23:56,966 --> 01:23:57,797
which carry on

2145
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:58,602
through the universe

2146
01:23:58,603 --> 01:24:02,308
toward the infinite,

2147
01:24:02,309 --> 01:24:03,911
perhaps to be tuned in

2148
01:24:03,946 --> 01:24:05,514
by an intelligent species

2149
01:24:05,549 --> 01:24:07,988
on a distant planet.

2150
01:24:07,989 --> 01:24:08,484
Some people think

2151
01:24:08,519 --> 01:24:10,051
that there's an expanding shell

2152
01:24:10,086 --> 01:24:12,320
of radio and television

2153
01:24:12,355 --> 01:24:15,059
from Earth, expanding outward

2154
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:17,564
alerting the universe,

2155
01:24:17,599 --> 01:24:18,665
"here we are

2156
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:25,546
and this is our culture."

2157
01:24:25,617 --> 01:24:26,277
Unfortunately,

2158
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:27,345
recent calculations

2159
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:29,953
by of all people, the SETI,

2160
01:24:29,954 --> 01:24:31,156
Search for Extraterrestrial

2161
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,529
Intelligence group,

2162
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:34,781
has shown that all

2163
01:24:34,816 --> 01:24:36,033
of this dissipates

2164
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:37,496
within one and two light-years

2165
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:40,971
into noise.

2166
01:24:40,972 --> 01:24:42,704
If this is true,

2167
01:24:42,705 --> 01:24:44,147
our signals won't even make it

2168
01:24:44,182 --> 01:24:45,679
out to the newest star

2169
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:51,259
beyond the sun.

2170
01:24:53,963 --> 01:24:56,517
So what will remain 10, 000 years

2171
01:24:56,552 --> 01:24:59,071
after people to tell the story

2172
01:24:59,072 --> 01:25:00,904
of the once great civilizations

2173
01:25:00,905 --> 01:25:03,279
that walked the Earth?

2174
01:25:03,314 --> 01:25:05,511
Iron corrodes,

2175
01:25:05,512 --> 01:25:08,616
concrete crumbles,

2176
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:11,721
wood and paper decay.

2177
01:25:11,722 --> 01:25:13,524
Still, some of what man

2178
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:18,603
built on Earth remains.

2179
01:25:18,604 --> 01:25:19,670
The most colossal

2180
01:25:19,705 --> 01:25:21,537
of our stone structures

2181
01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:23,741
like the Great Wall of China

2182
01:25:23,776 --> 01:25:25,944
have aged like mountains,

2183
01:25:25,945 --> 01:25:27,847
subject to erosion,

2184
01:25:27,848 --> 01:25:29,981
but at such slow time scales,

2185
01:25:29,982 --> 01:25:31,684
they will still be recognizable

2186
01:25:31,685 --> 01:25:36,231
in some form for eons.

2187
01:25:36,233 --> 01:25:38,215
the great pyramid at Giza

2188
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,160
is so massive that it lasts

2189
01:25:40,195 --> 01:25:42,071
long enough to be swallowed up

2190
01:25:42,072 --> 01:25:48,513
by the desert sands.

2191
01:25:48,548 --> 01:25:49,920
The Hoover dam

2192
01:25:49,955 --> 01:25:51,182
built to be as tough

2193
01:25:51,217 --> 01:25:53,721
as the canyon walls around it

2194
01:25:53,756 --> 01:25:54,722
is one of the last

2195
01:25:54,723 --> 01:25:56,124
man-made structures

2196
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:58,894
still standing.

2197
01:25:58,929 --> 01:26:02,004
But now thousands of years

2198
01:26:02,005 --> 01:26:03,401
in the future,

2199
01:26:03,436 --> 01:26:05,479
Earth is about to be visited

2200
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,477
by the last

2201
01:26:06,512 --> 01:26:13,092
of the great collapses.

2202
01:26:13,093 --> 01:26:14,559
It's the environment

2203
01:26:14,594 --> 01:26:16,026
that eventually wins.

2204
01:26:16,027 --> 01:26:27,475
Earthquakes, sandstorms, rain.

2205
01:26:27,476 --> 01:26:29,750
but there are a few exceptions.

2206
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:31,404
I would have to say

2207
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:33,024
that Mount Rushmore,

2208
01:26:33,025 --> 01:26:35,588
carved out of solid granite

2209
01:26:35,589 --> 01:26:38,864
in an ecologically stable place,

2210
01:26:38,865 --> 01:26:40,833
the only enemy it has

2211
01:26:40,868 --> 01:26:43,136
is wind-driven pellets of rain.

2212
01:26:43,171 --> 01:26:45,404
I think that Mount Rushmore

2213
01:26:45,405 --> 01:26:46,777
may be around

2214
01:26:46,778 --> 01:26:47,879
a hundred thousand years,

2215
01:26:47,914 --> 01:26:49,811
possibly 200.

2216
01:26:49,812 --> 01:26:50,883
Possibly even in time

2217
01:26:50,884 --> 01:26:53,819
to be looked at in awe

2218
01:26:53,854 --> 01:26:55,621
by the earliest

2219
01:26:55,622 --> 01:27:02,002
of our replacements.

2220
01:27:02,003 --> 01:27:05,242
and who or what might

2221
01:27:05,277 --> 01:27:08,482
those replacements be?

2222
01:27:08,483 --> 01:27:10,952
Perhaps chimpanzees

2223
01:27:10,987 --> 01:27:14,752
might somehow make the leap.

2224
01:27:14,753 --> 01:27:17,327
But we have to consider this:

2225
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:19,262
some scientists believe

2226
01:27:19,297 --> 01:27:21,163
that it's easy for nature

2227
01:27:21,164 --> 01:27:21,934
to bring animals

2228
01:27:21,935 --> 01:27:24,304
up to a clever level

2229
01:27:24,339 --> 01:27:26,171
where they might use tools,

2230
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:27,213
they might become masters

2231
01:27:27,214 --> 01:27:30,384
of their environment.

2232
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:31,780
But the leap to being able

2233
01:27:31,782 --> 01:27:34,220
to stare at the sky

2234
01:27:34,255 --> 01:27:36,658
and imagine a cosmos,

2235
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:37,560
to be able

2236
01:27:37,561 --> 01:27:38,727
to contemplate yourself,

2237
01:27:38,762 --> 01:27:39,894
to be able to contemplate

2238
01:27:39,895 --> 01:27:44,672
your own role in the Earth,

2239
01:27:44,707 --> 01:27:45,773
this may be a leap

2240
01:27:45,774 --> 01:27:47,306
that was a sheer accident

2241
01:27:47,341 --> 01:27:49,449
for humanity.

2242
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:50,416
In which case,

2243
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:51,382
you're not talking

2244
01:27:51,383 --> 01:27:53,100
about a complete recovery.

2245
01:27:53,135 --> 01:27:54,818
You're talking about a planet

2246
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:58,664
that may continue,

2247
01:27:58,665 --> 01:28:01,900
but nobody to talk about it,

2248
01:28:01,935 --> 01:28:05,135
nobody to think about it.

2249
01:28:05,206 --> 01:28:09,082
If Earth's 4.5 billion years of existence

2250
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:12,084
were condensed into 24 hours,

2251
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:15,051
the passage of 10,000 years

2252
01:28:15,052 --> 01:28:17,705
would be a fraction of a second.

2253
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:20,359
Man's time on the planet so far

2254
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:26,068
would be about half a minute long

2255
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:30,076
so, like an abandoned village 
on a global scale

2256
01:28:30,147 --> 01:28:32,600
the Earth will move on without us

2257
01:28:32,635 --> 01:28:35,053
There was life before people.

2258
