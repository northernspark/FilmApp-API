Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,347
Okay.

3
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,350
- Ehh.
- Hi.

4
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,560
- Holly.
- Eric.

5
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,270
- Messer.
- Messer.

6
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:07,941
- Messer. Yeah, everybody calls me Messer.
- Well, it's nice to finally meet you, Messer.

7
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,235
- Am I late?
- Um, just an hour.

8
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,906
But I just finished getting ready,
and Alison said it was your m. o., so...

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,284
- Peter said you'd probably say something.
- Ha, ha. Oh, did he? Oh, okay.

10
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,914
- Neat. Should we go?
- Yeah, yeah, let's go.

11
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,376
Yeah, let's get some dinner.
I'm super hungry. It's been like an hour.

12
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,587
So I hear you just moved to Atlanta.

13
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,922
Yep.
- Oh.

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,758
- How long have you known Pete for?
- High school.

15
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,134
Oh, wow.

16
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:35,969
Oh, thank you.

17
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,264
I've known Alison since college.
We were in a sorority together.

18
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,392
- Where's your car?
- Right here.

19
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,562
- Here you go.
- Oh.

20
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,356
Come on.

21
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,942
Hold on tight.
I promise I won't read into it.

22
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,321
- I'm not really dressed for 40-mile-an-hour-
- What?

23
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,365
I'm not really dressed
for 40-mile-an-hour winds.

24
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,493
Sorry. I just-

25
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,038
You know, I don't even think
I could really get my leg up over it, so...

26
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,206
But I'll drive.

27
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,335
My car's right here.
And it's new, so I love driving it.

28
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,255
- It's a sweet ride.
- Thanks.

29
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,881
Hop in.

30
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,723
All right.

31
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,308
Hm.
- Huh.

32
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,686
So where shall we go?

33
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,273
Uh, where did you make the reservations?

34
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,025
That you said you were going to make.
You didn't make them?

35
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,069
- I said that?
- It's cool. Whatever.

36
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,530
Yeah, it's cool.
We can go anywhere, I don't care.

37
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,198
We can- You pick it.

38
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,868
We'll grab a table
and we'll just slide right in.

39
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,872
Okay. Well, how about Cafe Five?
You ever been there?

40
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,166
- Sounds good.
- My friend from culinary school is the-

41
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,877
TRICK DADDY
Pull over, that ass is too fat

42
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,461
- It's just my cell phone.
- I figured.

43
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,922
- You can answer it if you-
- No, no, it'll go to voicemail.

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,341
- Okay.
- Just...

45
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:01,430
Yeah, well, I was just saying my friend
from culinary school is actually the-

46
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,391
You know what?
Go ahead, just answer it, it's fine.

47
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,103
- I'm- I can wait.
- All right. Yeah. It's a little too loud.

48
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,107
Hey, you.

49
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,237
Well, you know me,
always in the middle of something.

50
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,865
Yeah, okay, yeah. Eleven?

51
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,785
Yeah. You know what?
Why don't we make it 10:30?

52
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,455
All right. All right, later.

53
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,081
Okay.

54
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,670
I'm sorry, it's a... It's a sick friend.

55
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,466
You know, we don't have to do this.

56
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,426
Really?

57
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,472
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, are you serious?

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,806
Okay, let's be honest.

59
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,392
You knew the moment you saw me
you didn't like me.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,854
But our mutual friends set this up,
so I think we owe it to them to-

61
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,899
To what,
spend a few hours faking small talk?

62
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,277
Look, best case,
we get drunk and we hook up.

63
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,571
What kind of an asshole are you?

64
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,324
Look, it's a Saturday night.
I just want to have some fun.

65
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,995
I can go see my sick friend,
and you can go do...

66
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,748
...whatever it is you like to do
on a Saturday night.

67
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,876
You look like you read.
You can go read a book.

68
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,463
- Do you blog?
- Do I blog? Okay. You know what?

69
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,217
If you wanted to ensure that this
wasn't going to be a lousy night, here's a tip:

70
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,970
Don't show up an hour late,
and don't make a booty call.

71
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,805
- She's sick.
- Oh, right.

72
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,724
Were you going to heal her
with your magic penis?

73
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,394
Okay.

74
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,314
- Fine. If you want to go out, we'll go out-
- Oh, my God, no.

75
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,526
I'm not going out with you now.
What are you, crazy?

76
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,696
Get out of my car.
Get out of my Smart car.

77
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,617
- I don't know what they were thinking.
- Me neither.

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,038
Alison, oh, my God.
The only way you can make this up to me...

79
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,249
...is if you promise
I never have to see him again.

80
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,966
Really, you are like
the most important woman in my life...

81
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,345
...and Alison is the sister I never had.

82
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:10,726
And I love you so much,
and I'm so grateful for you and Peter.

83
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,939
Look at Mess. In back.

84
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,569
Nice.
Whoo.

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,118
Yeah.

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,872
Anyway, I was just trying to say
how excited I am for you-

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,457
I love you. Alison.

88
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:38,128
Messer, it's my turn. It's my turn.
You already gave your speech.

89
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,921
Are you maid of honour?
- Yes.

90
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,716
Can we switch you guys out?
I need you next to the bride.

91
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,432
Get right in here with you guys.

92
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,726
Don't touch me.
I knew you were going to do that.

93
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,187
- Don't touch me. Don't encourage him.
Ha-ha-ha!

94
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,441
Stop it. I swear to God. Stop.

95
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,152
I'm sorry, I can't stand next to him.

96
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,449
Hey, guys.
Here we are at the holiday party. Holly, Ben.

97
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,909
Here you go.

98
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,994
How's that first date going, guys?

99
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,497
I mean, what really happened? Tell me.

100
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,875
Yo, Mess. Mess.

101
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,502
- She has work to do.
- Dude. Dude.

102
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,004
- Help me. Take the camera.
- Give me the camera.

103
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,256
Whoa, check it out.

104
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,425
Come here.
Look at Alison's bun in the oven.

105
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,887
Bun in the oven.
Excuse me, guys. All right? Honey?

106
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,681
Well, well, look at that.

107
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,060
- She's my daughter.
Won't be long now.

108
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,229
Don't squeeze the belly.

109
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,190
Hey, Holly. What's this?

110
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,278
Come on, just a little Christmas kiss.
Just give him a-

111
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,572
Great. Yay, happy holidays.

112
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,116
You are an asshole.

113
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,451
Hi, baby girl.

114
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,161
Hi. Oh, my gosh.

115
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,747
- Baby.
- Hi.

116
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,374
Hold on, Messer, I just got her.

117
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,251
She's with Aunt Holly now.
- Dude.

118
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,004
- Careful, Messer. Gently.
- I got her. I got her.

119
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,881
- Whoa!
- Oh!

120
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,216
- Honey.
- I'm just playing.

121
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,717
It's not funny.
- She's fine.

122
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,513
- She's like a little football.
- Would you stop it? Messer. Messer.

123
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,098
- Okay.
- Stop it, seriously.

124
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,399
PETER & ALISON
Cats have kittens

125
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,652
Doggies have pups

126
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,615
Horses have pretty foals

127
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,619
And sheep have lambs

128
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,623
Cows have calves
And I bet you didn't know

129
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,169
That elephants have calves too

130
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,338
Lions and leopards have cubs

131
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:51,136
Which is the proper thing for them to do

132
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,686
She's going to blow if you keep
doing that. She's in a puking phase.

133
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,063
No, she loves it.

134
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,648
She loves it, don't you, Soph?

135
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,401
You're the only girl I'll ever shave for.
You know that?

136
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,738
Speaking of, why didn't Liz come?
I thought you were getting serious.

137
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,866
No, we ended that a few weeks ago.
It wasn't working out.

138
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,576
What happened?
- I don't know.

139
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,746
I just didn't see us
on that long march towards death together.

140
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,958
- Oh, my bad. I thought you liked this girl.
- That was you. I just thought she was hot.

141
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,669
Honey, don't forget
to tip the castle guys.

142
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,007
They show up late
and made me do the work.

143
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,385
- But, sure, let's tip the castle guys.
Grasshopper.

144
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,263
So I started taking Sophie
to this new family practice.

145
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,473
Mm-hm.

146
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,935
There's this doctor there. He's so cute.

147
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,772
I may have finally replaced
my Anderson Cooper crush.

148
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,484
- Anyway, I noticed no ring...
- Scoot.

149
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,945
...so I started a conversation
with his nurse.

150
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,780
- No.
- I pretended to like her nails.

151
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,575
- No. We agreed to a moratorium on setups.
- How do you know you won't like him?

152
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,786
You have the worst
setup track record ever.

153
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,705
- Like who?
- The shoplifter. Adult-braces guy.

154
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,875
Unbelievable.
You're still holding that over me.

155
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,878
I'm not even going to
get into the Messer Debacle of '07.

156
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,422
Well, that was Peter.
I hardly even knew him then.

157
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,425
You knew he called himself Messer.
And you're my best friend.

158
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,720
You can't be like those women
who judge me because I don't wear a ring.

159
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,930
I'm not.

160
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,432
In the meantime,
you keep having gorgeous babies...

161
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,227
...and I will keep spoiling them with this.

162
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,896
Seriously,
that's better than my wedding cake.

163
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,482
- I made your wedding cake.
- It was a little dry.

164
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,403
Don't let any fat grown-ups in
while the kids are inside.

165
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,823
Have you guys been smoking marijuana?

166
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,200
- That's illegal.
- You're stoned.

167
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,121
What are you holding? Let me see it.
Come on, you want me to call the cops?

168
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,623
Please don't. My dad's a pastor.

169
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,837
All right, I'm taking this.
Next time, you are going to be trouble.

170
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,589
- Now get out of here.
- That's-

171
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,424
- Get out of here.
- Get out of here!

172
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,135
I bought that stuff.
- Totally unacceptable.

173
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,138
Delivery kids show up
stoned out of their minds.

174
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,849
- Who needs a dealer?
- Aren't you respectable now?

175
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,602
Relax. Once a year,
under the right circumstances...

176
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,687
...Alison and I like to relive our youth.

177
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,896
- Once a year?
- Yeah-

178
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,733
- Yeah, right. Once a year.
- All right, maybe twice a year.

179
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,818
Want to go? Come on, come on.

180
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,864
- Messer, do not bounce her too much.
- She's fine. She loves it, look at her.

181
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,700
- Mess, I'm warning you.
- Come on, she's fine. Ohh!

182
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,786
Oh, my God. She-

183
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,039
Oh, my God.

184
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,377
Don't worry, Sophie, you're not the first girl
to throw up on Uncle Messer.

185
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,088
Hey, Sophie, look.
Look, that's what bitter looks like.

186
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,884
Messer, go up to Peter's closet and
grab something before everyone gets here.

187
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,761
- Why, what time is it?
- It's 11.

188
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,431
Though it's only 10 in Messer time.
You know, I'm surprised you're even up.

189
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,518
- You keep your watch on during sex.
- At least I don't wear my cap everywhere.

190
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,855
You can take it off now.
We all know about the receding hairline.

191
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,608
It's a widow's peak.
I don't have a receding hairline.

192
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,444
Hey, baby's birthday. Neutral corners.
Take a glass.

193
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,405
First birthday,
you can take your hat off for pictures.

194
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,574
- There it is.
- Before everyone gets here...

195
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,868
...we wanted to toast
Sophie's favourite people.

196
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,078
And our best friends.

197
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,831
We made it through her first year
with most of our sanity thanks to you guys.

198
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,209
- We love you guys.
- Are you crying?

199
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,460
Mothers cry.

200
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,881
- The babysitter's here.
- Why do you need a babysitter?

201
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,257
Because she's a genius.

202
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,760
When Sophie goes nuclear,
she can calm her down.

203
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,138
- We call her the baby whisperer.
- Oh, the baby whisperer, huh?

204
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,974
- Hey, is she hot?
- Totally hot.

205
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:29,521
What's wrong with you?
- Hey, everybody, this is Amy.

206
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,149
- Hello, Amy.
- Look who's here.

207
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,026
Sophie.

208
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,279
Let's go get you changed, him?

209
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,281
Thank you.

210
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,284
Are you serious?
That's the baby whisperer?

211
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,746
Really, if she was old enough
to have sex with Peter, I'd be obsolete.

212
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,999
- You'll never be obsolete, babe. Come here.
- Mm-hm.

213
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,086
Oh, my God. Could you step away?
You reek of baby puke.

214
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,004
Oh, really?

215
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,340
- You do. Get away from me.
- Excuse me.

216
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,217
You've all met before.

217
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,096
- You met before. Remember Sophie?
- I can't believe you guys have four now.

218
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,891
Did she have any tearing?
Oh, yeah, stem to stern.

219
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,477
They had to crack that woman open
like a lobster.

220
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,480
Excuse me.
Excuse me, miss, are you the caterer?

221
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,774
Yes, and Alison's friend.

222
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,068
Okay, because you need
to come and sit here.

223
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,572
Okay? You need to come over here
right now and sit down.

224
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,490
Someone is in trouble...

225
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,160
- ... because you make food to die for.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

226
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,369
Thank you.

227
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,288
- I was a real jock back in college.
- Yeah?

228
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,582
Mm-hm. A sprinter.

229
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,542
- Really?
- Yeah, ran a 4.240.

230
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,836
- Wow, that's fast.
- Yeah, it's fast.

231
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,172
How else do you think I snagged
Miss Pennsylvania here?

232
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,759
- Uh-oh. Who's talking about me? Okay.
- Oh, here she is.

233
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,637
Okay, that's good for now.
So who is this? Hi, I'm Beth.

234
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,014
- Messer.
- Nice to meet you.

235
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,141
- Nice to meet you.
- We have not met before.

236
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,059
I would remember this face of his.

237
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,605
If you've got a loving partner,
you can get through anything. Hey, Scott!

238
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,939
- Yeah, I'm-
- Scott!

239
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,566
- Hold that. Hold on.
- Hey, Scott.

240
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,610
- I was trying to get the boys fed.
- Okay.

241
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,822
I think Conner may have gotten himself
into a little trouble, you know what I mean?

242
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,241
- Okay, okay.
- This is my husband, Scott.

243
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,619
- Hi, how are you?
- It's nice to meet you. Holly.

244
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,205
Okay. I left those diapers in the car.

245
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,623
We used to have sex.

246
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,459
We used to have sex all the time,
you know, everywhere.

247
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,668
Everywhere.

248
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,630
Then the baby needs to be fed,
the kids need to be asleep...

249
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,383
...and they have to have slept
the night before or else you're exhausted.

250
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,845
- Hi, I'm Ted's partner, Gary.
- Busted.

251
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,556
No, I'm actually single, I'm...

252
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:32,519
- It's just me.
- Okay, okay.

253
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:36,064
Well, you serve good meats and cheeses.

254
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,858
- I think we were all talking about that.
- Thank you.

255
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:44,322
That's something.
I think that's good to have as a skill.

256
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,283
- Did you wrap those?
- Yes, I did.

257
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:51,246
Look at that. She wraps.
I don't touch meat.

258
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,164
Only with my lips.

259
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:58,795
ALL
Happy birthday, dear Sophie

260
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:04,050
Happy birthday to you

261
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,104
Guys, I want a picture of Sophie
with her godparents.

262
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,814
Okay.

263
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,315
- Amazing.
- She looks excited.

264
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,525
Picture.

265
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,111
All right, on three say,
"Messer has a widow's peak. "

266
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,737
One, two...

267
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,948
- Cheese.
Sophie.

268
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,076
Yay.

269
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,000
Is it a good party? You want some cake?

270
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,642
Come on, here we go.

271
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,353
Oh. Ohh!

272
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,079
- Hi.
- Hey.

273
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,582
You want to get a late breakfast?

274
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,586
No, I can't. I got a game in an hour.
I got to go shower.

275
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,176
- Mm. Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure. There's coffee.

276
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,346
Oh, and mugs are in the cabinet.

277
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,031
Ooh. This looks delicious.
- It's not ready.

278
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,408
- I'm just taking a bite.
- The crumb is too fine.

279
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,994
- I should've gone with Ceylon cinnamon.
- Oh, my God.

280
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,413
- Cassia's just wrong.
- You're a genius. You are.

281
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:01,501
You may be bipolar, but you're a genius.
I swear, I would eat them out of the trash.

282
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,795
- I would, they're so good.
- That's nasty.

283
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,547
Hey, Free-Range Turkey's here.

284
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,884
Where you going? See, I knew it.
You do this every time he comes in.

285
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,929
- I know you get excited.
- I'm just trying to be responsible.

286
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,889
I'm going to take over here. Thank you.

287
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,600
You don't act like this
when Old Man Johnson comes in.

288
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,311
- Don't be a smart-ass. Go fix your cookies.
- Okay.

289
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,022
- Hey.
- Let me guess.

290
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,484
- Free-range turkey on baguette?
- I'm getting predictable, huh?

291
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,405
Well, I like to think of it as dependable.
It's been 35 of the same sandwich.

292
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:34,075
- Hm. You're counting?
- Ish. Thirty-five-ish.

293
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,621
You know, there are other things on
the menu if you'd like to try something else.

294
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,748
- Surprise me.
- Okay. All right, great.

295
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,750
- Do you like croissants?
- I do, yeah.

296
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,253
Good, then I've got just the thing.

297
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,969
How come you don't wear one of those
white coats with your name on it?

298
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,220
So I'd know what it is.

299
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,556
- It's Holly.
- Holly. Sam.

300
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,143
- Nice to meet you.
- We met 35 sandwiches ago.

301
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,186
Thirty-six now.

302
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:09,110
- Thanks. Keep the change.
- Oh, thanks.

303
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,571
Sure you don't want to throw your card
in the bowl?

304
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,448
Winner gets a free lunch.

305
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,159
How about a free dinner on me?

306
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,290
Eh-eh-eh.

307
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,334
Be cool, be cool.
Let him get out the door. Damn.

308
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,755
- Go.
- Okay. Oh, no.

309
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,758
Which one was it?
Okay, that's a Benjamin. Oh, there's a Sam.

310
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,303
- I could pick one for you-
- How many Sams are there in this city?

311
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,098
And the Atlanta Hawks
trying to work it out over the other side.

312
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,267
Come on, people, let's bump up the energy.

313
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,186
It's an exciting game here. Come on.

314
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,188
And he scores.
- Go 7.

315
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:49,108
Simon, I need shooting percentages.
Ready 8. Let's zoom in on 8.

316
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,319
More, more, more. Yep, right there. Go 8.

317
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,656
Ready 2. And go 2.
Ready 6. Where's my 6?

318
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,659
The Hawks are about to press.
We should stay in the backcourt.

319
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,287
- pass inbound.
Stolen by Bibby to Smith underneath.

320
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,123
Good call, Mess.
Simon, I asked for shooting percentages.

321
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,335
Let's go. You're too ugly not to be smarter.
Come on, let's go.

322
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,421
- I hate him so much.
Ready 4.

323
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,007
I want to frame somebody's murder on him,
you know?

324
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,843
- Fingerprints, scene of the crime.
- What's that, Simon?

325
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,678
Shooting percentages coming up, sir.

326
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,851
Hi, Sam, this is Holly Berenson
from Fraiche.

327
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:28,356
I think you left your card in my bowl today
for the free lunch.

328
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,901
I hope you did, because you're one
of four Sams who did this week.

329
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,696
And if it is you and you asked me out,
I accept.

330
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,864
- If it's-
Hello?

331
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,866
- Hello?
- Why are you calling my husband?

332
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,161
- Right, you're his wife. Of course.
- We're very happily married.

333
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,539
I understand that you're happily married.

334
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,375
Really, I didn't mean anything by it.
I'm so sorry. Okay.

335
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,293
You take care. I'm sorry.

336
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,504
- Hi, Sam?
Yes, Samantha.

337
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,133
Oh, Samantha. Oh, it's a Samantha.
I'm sorry, I have the wrong-

338
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,010
Maybe not. You single?

339
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,721
I am single, yes.

340
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,392
Hi, Sam Nelson. Dr. Sam Nelson.

341
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,103
This is Holly Berenson from Fraiche...

342
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,732
...and I am really hoping
that you're the Sam I talked to today.

343
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,152
If not, I'm screwed
because you're the last Sam...

344
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,237
...who put his card in the bowl
for a free lunch.

345
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,906
Oh, I'm sorry.

346
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,658
Call waiting.

347
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,077
Hello?

348
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,581
Yes, this is she.

349
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,599
Excuse me.
I'm looking for an Officer Young.

350
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,268
The officer at the scene
found your name and number...

351
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,938
...on an insurance contact card
in her wallet.

352
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,609
Now, we need numbers
for the nearest next of kin.

353
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,943
Can you supply those?

354
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,946
Yeah. Pete's dad, um...

355
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,075
How did you say the car flipped?
It flipped when it hit the...?

356
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:07,246
- Are you sure you wouldn't like to sit down?
- They have a baby girl.

357
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,124
Sophie. Was she in the car?
Was she in the car with them?

358
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:15,129
No. She was in the care of a minor,
a babysitter, at the time of the accident.

359
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,965
So the officers placed her with CPS
for the night.

360
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,218
- She's perfectly fine.
- CPS?

361
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,511
Child Protective Services.

362
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,056
Where they take cases like this.

363
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,350
Cases like this?

364
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,103
Orphaned children.

365
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,840
Messer.

366
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,153
No, no, no. I just don't understand
why we can't see her tonight.

367
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,780
No, ma'am,
I don't care about your protocol. This is-

368
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:10,286
Yes, I will be here at this number. Yes.

369
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,956
They won't do anything,
not till 8 a. m. tomorrow.

370
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,834
Okay, okay. I'm sure that she's fine.

371
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,253
You know,
why don't we sleep here tonight?

372
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,672
That way we're here if they call early.
All right?

373
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,091
- Okay.
- Why don't you take the guest bedroom?

374
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:28,846
- Okay, you can take their room if you want.
- No, thank you. I'll sleep over here.

375
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,682
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.

376
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,227
- Thanks, Messer.
- Okay.

377
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,409
Anyone call?

378
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,787
Just their lawyer.

379
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,999
He's coming over now.
He wants to talk to us.

380
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,295
I'm sure this is a very difficult
time for you, obviously.

381
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,674
Everyone at the firm,
we will miss Peter very much.

382
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,177
Now, you must have many questions.

383
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,930
Well, Sophie.
I think that's who we're both thinking of.

384
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,682
- Yes.
- What will happen to her now?

385
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,309
Okay, well,
I have already arranged for her transfer.

386
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,104
The foster family she was with
will bring her to CPS.

387
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,898
They feel she'll adjust best
in her own environment...

388
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,485
...so first she needs to be picked up
and brought here.

389
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,864
Okay, and who does that?

390
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:16,245
I'm sorry, did Alison and Peter talk to you
about their guardianship arrangements?

391
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,705
- No.
- No.

392
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,419
Well, in preparing their will, we talked
about who would take care of Sophie...

393
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,046
...in the unlikely event
that they should both die...

394
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,508
...and they named you.

395
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,718
Both of you.

396
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,387
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,849
- They picked us together?
- This isn't how you wanted to start a family.

398
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,393
There's been a misunderstanding.
We are not married.

399
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,397
They tried to set us up on a blind date,
and we never made it to the restaurant.

400
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:46,775
I don't even know if you'd call it a date.
He was such a dick.

401
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,235
I know this is overwhelming.

402
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,529
Believe me,
I tried to advise them against it.

403
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,948
But there are options. You can say no.

404
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:57,912
Because this is a big deal. This is a child.

405
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,081
Big commitment.

406
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,669
Oh, my God.

407
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,510
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

408
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,609
- Sorry.
- Options.

409
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,987
You mentioned
that there were some other options?

410
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,323
Yes. We have Peter's father.

411
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,284
- Oh. Perfect. He'd be perfect, I think.
- There you go.

412
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,870
- There's cousins.
- I'm sorry, can I stop you there?

413
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,539
Cousins are always...
- Yeah.

414
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,626
What if one of us, on our own,
by ourselves...

415
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,295
...chose to honour Alison and Peter's wishes
on our own?

416
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,923
Or both of us, hypothetically.

417
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,425
They named you,
so I just set up a court hearing...

418
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,844
...to grant you temporary custody,
and that's it.

419
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,179
Now, the finances...

420
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,057
...the estate will cover the mortgage,
but that's about it.

421
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:04,687
They didn't have much in savings.
They bought this house as an investment.

422
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,314
But, you know,
let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

423
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,732
Let's just focus on Sophie.

424
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,942
- Yes.
- Right.

425
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:15,906
So I suggest the two of you move in here
in the interim, for Sophie.

426
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,618
- You want us to live together?
- For Sophie, for now.

427
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:23,622
Until you decide what you want to do.
But it's best.

428
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,763
Okay. Sign here, Ms. Berenson.

429
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,646
And here, Mr. Messer.

430
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,484
- Thank you.
- Oh, there she is.

431
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,945
Hi.

432
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,823
Hi, sweet girl.

433
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,326
Oh, honey, it's so good to see you.

434
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,914
I know, I know.

435
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:12,504
I know. Hey, look. Hey, look.

436
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:16,884
You want Uncle Messer? Here.
There's Uncle Messer.

437
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,429
Oh, God. Okay. We should get her home.

438
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,951
- They definitely didn't think this through.
- We need to establish a sleep schedule.

439
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,204
- It's very important.
- What?

440
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,455
I guess.

441
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,750
- What did you say?
- I said they didn't think this through.

442
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,127
Did Pete say anything to you? Or Alison?

443
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,296
- They didn't tell me anything.
- Nope.

444
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,632
This is not the kind of thing
you forget to mention.

445
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,718
"Hey, you see that game
where Kobe put the juke on that dude...

446
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,345
...then hit the fade away jumper?

447
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,473
Oh, and by the way, if I die,
I'm going to leave you with my kid. "

448
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,767
- It's messed up.
- Alison was a planner.

449
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,978
- We are part of a plan.
- You want to walk me through this plan?

450
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,439
Are we supposed to live
in this house together?

451
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,443
Share the place, both sleep-deprived?
Sounds like a compelling psych experiment.

452
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,279
Assuming you and I can even afford
to pay for this place.

453
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,115
Dunn said the mortgage is covered.

454
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,159
Well, what about the upkeep?
Or the utilities or the taxes?

455
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,328
You have any idea
what the nut on this is?

456
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,124
Pete was a junior partner at a law firm.
I don't make this kind of cash.

457
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,710
And what do you do?
You bake scones for a living?

458
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,254
I run a successful business.
I do pretty well.

459
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,006
Yeah? Well, running a baby
is not like running a bakery.

460
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,843
- I didn't say it was.
- They're a mess. They pee on things.

461
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,137
They bite. They're basically dogs.

462
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,848
Except at least a dog knows
not to lick the electrical sockets.

463
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,309
She's up. She's up.

464
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,939
- Okay, honey. Hey. Hi.
- Hey. Hey, look at the sleepyhead.

465
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,274
Hi, honey.
- Here we go.

466
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,483
Hey, come here.

467
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,110
- No, no, don't pick her up.
- Why?

468
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,362
Because she needs to learn
how to self-soothe.

469
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,365
- She needs to what?
- Self-soothe. Soothe herself.

470
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,660
I just read it, Messer. It's important.
Let's just give it a minute.

471
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,080
Everything's okay. Happy, happy girl.

472
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,667
You know what? Let's just sing a song.
We'll sing a song.

473
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,503
The wheels on the bus go round and round

474
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,839
Round and round
Round and round

475
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,633
The wheels on the bus go round and round

476
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,844
All through the town

477
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,971
The- I don't know.

478
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,474
- And then Keanu Reeves saves the bus
- Nice.

479
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,601
Saves the bus
Saves the bus

480
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,936
And then Keanu Reeves saves the bus

481
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,189
- And then he dies
- That's all I got.

482
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,565
Does he die? I don't know.

483
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,818
Okay. Maybe she's hungry.
I think she's hungry. I'm going to feed her.

484
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,155
- Come on, let's go eat. Come on.
- I thought we weren't picking her up.

485
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,789
- Okay, Sophie, I'm almost done, hold on.
- She's not a food critic. She's a 1-year-old.

486
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,209
- I'm not going to feed her just anything.
- But we're going to feed you today.

487
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,294
Hopefully before you're 2.

488
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,465
So tell me, what does Sophie do
to your dreams of ever meeting a guy...

489
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,842
...and having your own baby?
Thought about that?

490
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,512
A woman your age
already has a hard time competing...

491
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,388
...for the few guys who don't suck.

492
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,766
I'm sorry,
did you just say a woman my age?

493
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,560
In the dating world,
you wouldn't be considered single.

494
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,605
You know what you'd be? Complicated.
Beyond complicated.

495
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,440
You don't know anything about me.

496
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,443
Well, I know that you can't open
a childproof drawer.

497
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,655
Oh. There it is.

498
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,742
Why are you trying so hard
to convince me not to help her?

499
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,703
I'm not trying to.
I'm just trying to do what's best for her.

500
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,582
- You're trying to do what's best for you.
- I'm trying to do what's best for her.

501
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,084
We're not it.

502
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,920
They loved Sophie more than anything
in the entire world...

503
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,422
...and out of everyone, Messer,
they picked us.

504
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,258
They picked us.

505
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,803
I'm coming.

506
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,931
Check this out.
I think you're going to love it.

507
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,226
Taste sensation. Ready?

508
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,769
Mmm.

509
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:00,274
No? Come on. Just try it, Soph.
Just try it. I think you're going to love it.

510
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,693
Just try it.

511
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,445
Come on, Soph, give it a try.

512
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,990
Oh, please?
I've seen you eat things like this.

513
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,701
I think you're going to love it. Come on.

514
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,495
Mmm. Mmm. Yum, yum, yum.

515
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,290
There you go. Good girl, Soph-

516
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,429
So you honestly think
we're the best thing for her?

517
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,165
- Well, it was a beautiful service.
- Yeah.

518
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,335
- I did not know that's how they met.
- Oh, that story about Paris?

519
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,753
- Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

520
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,047
What is going to happen with the baby?
Do we know?

521
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,798
- Oh, yeah, you didn't hear?
- No.

522
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:11,428
They named one of their friends, yeah.
The single girl who bakes.

523
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,681
And the super-hot one that always smells,
like, so good and sweaty.

524
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,184
- That guy.
- That's interesting. So he'll be around.

525
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,728
- "Good"?
- What do you mean, "good and sweaty"?

526
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,233
Mom, thank you for being here.
I couldn't have done it without you.

527
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,945
- You're welcome.
- Mind watching her for another minute?

528
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,781
- I got to talk to Messer.
- Okay.

529
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,407
Mess.

530
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,746
- There's a lot of them.
- Well, we just need to find one.

531
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,708
- So I understand you're Peter's cousins?
- Hey, don't climb on that. Hey, hey.

532
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,460
- Who is that, Tyler?
- Mason.

533
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,754
Mason, take a seat right now. Let's go.

534
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,465
- Eight kids.
- Eight kids? You guys have eight kids?

535
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,886
- Nine, dear.
- Nine, right. Baseball team.

536
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,225
- I had to come for Alison.
- Yeah, thank you.

537
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,103
- And I was on tour through Atlanta, so...
- Oh, on tour.

538
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,814
Are you performing anywhere
that I would know?

539
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,565
I'm dancing at Juggles tonight...

540
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,485
...and then Bush League
Thursday through Monday.

541
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,406
Oh, how exciting.
That's really exciting. Yeah.

542
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,742
It's really good for Sophie
to get to see her grandfather.

543
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,538
She looks just like Peter.

544
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,290
I think she looks just like you.

545
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,961
So you have a house in Miami now?

546
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,046
Yeah, because we, you know,
were hoping...

547
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,216
...given that Sophie
is your only grandchild, that...

548
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,927
Well, it seems to make the most sense
that you'd be-

549
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,388
Oh!
Okay, okay, okay.

550
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,141
Sophie, no, no, no. Over here.

551
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,643
Oh, I am so sorry. Okay.

552
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,520
You okay? Okay.

553
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,397
- Good as new.
- Still breathing.

554
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,190
Yay.

555
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,288
Well, we could go
with the nine-kids family.

556
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,958
I mean, they clearly know
how to keep a child alive.

557
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,463
Stripper seemed nice.

558
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,507
Yeah.

559
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,304
And the grandpa's a definite no?

560
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,683
We're screwed.

561
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:28,857
Next case, the matter of
Sophie Novak, Index Number 05893-01.

562
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,067
All right.

563
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,652
I've read your submissions,
along with the will.

564
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,781
Given that you folks were named
as guardians...

565
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,492
...I see no reason
to countermand the parents' wishes.

566
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,285
However, permit-

567
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,083
Just leave it.
No, no.

568
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,294
- They're going to get ground into the carpet.
- Guys, guys, okay.

569
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,005
Let's leave the Goldfish.
What do you say we stand up?

570
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,841
- Okay. Okay.
- Stand up. Leave them.

571
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,885
Sorry.

572
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,137
- I'll pick these up.
- Just...

573
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,350
Until that time, I hereby grant
joint legal and physical custody...

574
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,354
...of Sophie Christina Novak
to Holly Berenson and Eric Messer.

575
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,399
That's it?
You're not going to ask us anything?

576
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,360
How do you know we're not dealers
or pimps?

577
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,528
Ha!

578
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:18,031
- Are you drug dealers or pimps?
- No, ma'am. No.

579
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,616
Let's go.

580
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,701
Boom. "Done, next case.

581
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,037
Here, take a kid.
No, take two, we got extra. "

582
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,165
Where is that stupid duck that she loves
that drives me crazy?

583
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,585
I don't get it, man. I've been good.
Some chick says:

584
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:34,339
"Messer, you can forget the condom,"
I say no, and I still end up with a kid.

585
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,175
We need to figure out a schedule.
I need to work tomorrow.

586
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,552
- Do you smell that?
- What?

587
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,389
- Oh, maybe she finally pooped. Did she?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think she-

588
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,683
What? It's not that bad.

589
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,643
Oh, Soph.

590
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,271
It's a weird smell, right?
Okay.

591
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,775
- Go ahead.
- What? Why me? Because I'm the girl?

592
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,235
- Yeah.
- No. Uh-uh.

593
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,946
I am not changing diapers
for the next two years.

594
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,032
- Get in there.
- Okay, fine. Easy. It's not that...

595
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,286
Something you can take off the checklist.
Check.

596
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,456
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

597
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,251
It's not a bra that I'm taking off a chick,
it's a diaper.

598
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,254
- It's not rocket science. Take the tabs off.
- Is there a box I can read?

599
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,631
See those little tabs? Undo them.

600
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,139
Oh, God. Don't do that.
You're going to make me throw up.

601
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,684
- It's like Slum dog Millionaire in there.
- You're going to make me throw up.

602
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,603
She didn't eat enough to produce that.

603
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,606
- She's getting it in her toes.
- Okay, give me the wipes.

604
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,317
- Give me another one.
- Hurry. Get it out of her toes.

605
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,610
What, it's like a poop suit.

606
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,615
- Oh, I got it.
- Messer. Don't leave me in here.

607
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,325
Oh, God.

608
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,622
Oh, it's burning my eyes.

609
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,458
I'm getting the feeling
this is a reconnaissance mission.

610
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,084
No one else is thinking that.

611
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,669
- Oh, hi.
Hi.

612
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,254
- Hi.
- Hello.

613
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,548
- Surprise.
- The athlete.

614
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,383
- Yeah, how's it going?
My Two Dads.

615
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,677
- What's up, buddy?
- Here comes the block.

616
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,970
What's going on?

617
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,641
Just, you know, bringing you
some covered dishes and whatnot.

618
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,393
New parents, got to stock the fridge.
One, two, three.

619
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,895
Just because. Ha, ha!

620
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,108
- Come on in.
- Oh, how unexpected.

621
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,568
Hope it's not a bad time.

622
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,280
Okay. Look at that, all clean.

623
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,909
Hey, the neighbourhood watch is here.
They brought us some-

624
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,162
What? She's perfect, no thanks to you.

625
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,750
- Holly, you have a-
- Save it, Messer. You big coward.

626
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,628
Okay. Come on.

627
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,757
Hey.
What a surprise.

628
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,385
Hey, guys, we weren't expecting you.
What a surprise.

629
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,595
Oh.

630
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,930
What?

631
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,349
Sweetie, you have shit on your face.

632
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,560
- So...
- Yeah.

633
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,943
- Who's hungry?
- I am.

634
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,444
- This one.
- Should we dive in?

635
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,030
- You got a little more, on the right.
- Just shut up.

636
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,198
- Okay.
- I swear.

637
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,409
I'm just trying to help.

638
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:15,166
- You doing okay? You look a little tired.
- That would be the not sleeping.

639
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,085
- Doesn't show.
- You don't look tired.

640
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,171
Don't worry, because you're not
going to sleep for 10 years.

641
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,381
Surprise.

642
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,092
And you're never going to
get used to children's music.

643
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,302
Oh, God.
No.

644
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,097
If I knew where the Wiggles lived,
and I'm working on it...

645
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,141
...I would murder them with an AK-47.

646
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,934
- I'm very serious.
- No new parents-

647
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,312
I don't think any of us knew
what we were doing.

648
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,771
- Not a clue.
Not a clue.

649
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:41,234
I mean, we had nine months to get ready
and we still screw up about half the time.

650
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,362
- He sure does.
- No, I said "we," actually.

651
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,032
Do you know what?
I'm going to get real serious.

652
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,909
You got to get two things straight.
One, get a sitter.

653
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,411
- And a backup.
- Absolutely.

654
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,954
Yeah.
Next, important:

655
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,458
- You can never have enough paper towels.
And don't shop at Shop Now.

656
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,377
They're always out of milk
and don't carry unscented wipes.

657
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,504
When you order Motrin, get the dye-free.

658
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,008
Oh, no BPAs. Sippy cups, any plastics.
You don't want those chemicals.

659
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,594
Alison wanted Sophie to go
to Big Wagon Preschool...

660
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,221
...so you may want to think
about making donations.

661
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,431
Like, yesterday.

662
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,185
Okay, maybe we should start
to write this down.

663
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,278
One bite, one bite, one bite.

664
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,412
The week.
- Can't do that.

665
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,623
You're writing my name.
- I already did-

666
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,293
There we go. Okay, Sophie girl.

667
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,129
- Your bath time, your bath time.
- Oh! Okay, get the baby.

668
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,924
- Your bath time, your bath time.
- All right.

669
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,676
All right, how about that?

670
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,345
No?

671
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,556
How about this one?

672
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,142
No?

673
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,624
Patterson with the turnaround.

674
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,167
Yeah!

675
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,380
What? You want to watch something else?

676
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,714
He shoots-

677
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,801
No, come on, missed the...

678
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,638
It's time to wiggle.

679
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,079
There we go.

680
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,129
You okay? You okay? Good.
Okay. I'm sorry.

681
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,092
Please?

682
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,433
- She's making the poop face.
- What do you mean?

683
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,810
Poop face.
Oh, God, she's going to poop in the tub.

684
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,021
Hurry up, hurry up.
She's going to poop on me.

685
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,648
- I don't know how to do this.
- She's going to poop on me.

686
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,277
You know what? Move, move. Let me do it.
Here. Just take her. I got it.

687
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,614
- Come on. I hate this thing.
- There's a latch. Pull the lever-

688
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:36,201
- Okay. Don't start. Sorry.
- No, no, no, not the hat.

689
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,286
Oh, my God, that's my hat.

690
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,872
That's my-
I've had that hat since high school.

691
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,500
- I'll wash it.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, it's funny.

692
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:48,922
Yeah, laugh it off. Laugh it off.
Okay, that's real funny.

693
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,049
Oh, God.

694
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,093
Um, I think we should just...

695
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,101
- Hey, what is that?
- What?

696
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,771
That lump. What's that?

697
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,898
- That's her bellybutton.
- No, it's not.

698
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,484
That wasn't there.
That was not there a few days ago.

699
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,403
- It's just an outie, isn't it?
- No, it's not an outie.

700
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,948
I don't think.

701
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:17,992
How does this...?

702
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,120
What are these numbers on here?
What does that mean?

703
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,372
Why is this...?

704
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,876
No one's going to steal a stroller.

705
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,504
We can't afford to be snobby.
It's our biggest event.

706
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,381
Bring out all the crowd pleasers.

707
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,300
Anything wrapped in bacon,
and the mushroom vol-au-vent.

708
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,636
Sorry to keep you waiting.

709
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,264
- I got to call you back.
- Holly.

710
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,682
Free-Range Turkey.

711
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,019
- Dr. Free-Range Turkey.
- Yes, Sam. I remember.

712
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,397
I heard about the accident.

713
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,983
I am so sorry about your friends.

714
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,401
Thank you.

715
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,446
Hey, you left me a half-message,
only it was the half without your number.

716
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,324
Yeah, something- Someone came up.

717
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,495
- How we doing?
- It's all right, sweetheart.

718
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,417
Is she sleeping okay?
Regular bowel movements?

719
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,795
Not at first, but now very regular.

720
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,298
But she does have this protrusion
on her stomach.

721
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:17,385
I don't know, you know, what it is.
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to look for.

722
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,221
I don't really know anything about kids.

723
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,807
Alison was the first of my friends
to have a baby...

724
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,726
...and she was amazing with Sophie.

725
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,021
And she would be the first person
I would call about this, you know?

726
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,274
I mean, she was the first person I called
about everything and...

727
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,569
God. It is killing me.

728
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,655
It is killing me right now
that I can't call my friend.

729
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,866
She just...

730
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,286
And I'd really like to say,
"What the hell were you thinking?

731
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,622
You could've left me your pearls
or YSL clutch.

732
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,206
I mean, this is a little much.

733
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,877
It's really, really hard,
and I don't know what I'm doing. "

734
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,212
I don't know what I'm doing.

735
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,055
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,724
No, I think you're doing pretty well,
considering.

737
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:09,187
Sophie's got an umbilical hernia.

738
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,358
It's nothing to worry about.
Most go away on their own. We'll watch it.

739
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,693
- Then I didn't do it?
- No, you did not do it.

740
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,528
Okay.

741
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,325
I thought you said it goes away
on its own.

742
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,661
That's for you.

743
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,333
"One bottle of Pinot Noir,
one to two glasses as needed. "

744
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,543
Or white. Same dosage, though.

745
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,757
Look, what you're doing is pretty incredible.
Give yourself a break every now and again.

746
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,968
- Thank you.
- I'll have my nurse set you up in a week?

747
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,303
- Okay.
- All right.

748
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,139
Bye, Sophie. You're going to be okay.

749
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,267
- Nice to see you.
- You too, really.

750
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,854
So I'm at the drugstore...

751
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,191
...and it dawns on me
that women stare at men carrying a baby...

752
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,361
...like a guy will stare at a woman
with a great rack.

753
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,115
You know what I just realized today?

754
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,534
I am never going to take a great bath
in this house.

755
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,745
This is a shower house.
You never brush your hair, do you?

756
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:11,124
It must save so much time.
That's so handy.

757
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,042
- How's that wine treating you?
- Mmm-hmm.

758
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,293
Mm-hm.

759
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,962
- Did you want some?
- No, no, no.

760
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,506
Because I can share. I'm a good sharer.

761
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,051
No, you don't need any,
because you never worry.

762
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,555
That's what Alison told me, you know,
when she set us up.

763
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,600
She said, "Honey, you just got your ass
dumped by your boyfriend of three years.

764
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:34,313
You need to go have a good time. "
And then, ta-da, you show up.

765
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,065
Your charming self shows up...

766
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,484
...and you don't even want to go
to the restaurant.

767
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:42,822
My first date in three years,
and it's a total asshole at the door.

768
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,367
And now I'm raising a kid
with that asshole.

769
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,495
- God, the irony.
- Come on, off to bed. Up, up, up.

770
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:53,499
You are, you know that, right? An asshole?
It feels good to say that to your face.

771
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,919
- Been saying it behind your back for years.
- A belligerent drunk. Great.

772
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,337
That'll be a fun next 18 years.

773
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,092
Everybody thinks I'm a fun drunk.
Someone's at the door. Who is it?

774
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,802
It's probably a neighbour.

775
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,097
- Yes?
- Hi, I'm Janine Groff.

776
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,975
Your caseworker from Social Services.

777
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,186
Yeah.

778
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,813
You were told
we'd be making a few unannounced visits.

779
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,523
Ow.

780
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,443
Yeah, well,
this is definitely unannounced.

781
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,446
- Just give me one minute.
- May I come in? No?

782
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,364
- Who is that?
- Social Services.

783
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,033
You got five minutes to shower...

784
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,703
...and start acting like the responsible pain
you've been since we moved in.

785
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,997
- Okay.
- Go, go, go.

786
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,417
Upstairs- Upstairs.
Your room is up here, remember?

787
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,920
- I'm sorry.
- Go, go, go.

788
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,381
- I'm going. Stop pushing me. Don't push.
- Just- I didn't...

789
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,675
You sure you don't want to see
the garage again?

790
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:45,927
Nope, twice is my limit.

791
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,096
I have a whole area of tools
you didn't even get a chance to see.

792
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,390
I'm good.
I'm usually wrapping up by now and-

793
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:55,269
Hello. I'm so sorry.
I had to get the little one down.

794
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,773
Oh.

795
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,610
And you can see why. Take your eyes
off her for one minute and, zoom!

796
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,696
You know? Just "tee-tee-tee-tee-tee"
on her little legs.

797
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,700
Okay, well, let's get started, then.

798
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,953
Okay, so let's just talk.

799
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,373
You know, I just want to get a sense
of the both of you, your plans.

800
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,416
Where do you see yourselves
in five years?

801
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,626
Ooh, ooh! Ooh!

802
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,711
- Ask me. I know. Great answer.
- You don't-

803
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:21,921
No, I'm good, I'm good.

804
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:26,175
I own a small gourmet-food store,
soon to be a small gourmet restaurant.

805
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,053
We're expanding.
New flooring, I'm thinking hexagonal tile.

806
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,931
New flooring.
That's part of everyone's five-year plans.

807
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,099
Flooring, right?

808
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,227
Anyway, I'm also hoping someday
to have my own frozen-food line.

809
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,522
Organic. But that's the 10-year plan.
You asked about the five-year.

810
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,357
Oh, God, I didn't include Sophie.

811
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,317
You didn't.
- Let me just take it back.

812
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:46,445
- She is a big part of my plan.
- That's fine. Thank you.

813
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,240
- Okay.
- Eric.

814
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,286
- Yep, Eric's good. Eric will be fine.
- Okay, Eric.

815
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:57,832
Well, I'm the technical director
on all Hawks broadcasts.

816
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,792
- Okay.
Yeah.

817
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,794
So, what does the technical director do?

818
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:06,382
Well, when the director says,
"Ready, go Camera 1," I'm the guy that-

819
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,511
- I push the button that goes Camera 1.
- He pushes the button.

820
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,471
And I guess in a couple years...

821
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,183
...when the boss gets kicked upstairs
or gets pinched with a tyranny hooker...

822
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,561
...I'll get my shot in the director's chair.

823
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,524
Okay. So Mr. Dunn tells me
that you're both single...

824
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:28,112
...and presently not engaged
in a relationship.

825
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,864
- Not sleeping together?
- God, no.

826
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,365
- Okay, good.
Oh, my God, no.

827
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,367
- No, no, no.
- Not a chance.

828
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,620
Okay, that's great,
because this situation...

829
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,664
...two single people
living under the same roof...

830
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:42,668
...raising a recently orphaned child,
well, it's complicated enough...

831
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,255
...without the added complication of,
you know, that.

832
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,842
Oh, trust me, Janine, we will not
be complicating anything with that.

833
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,719
Yeah, I get plenty of that elsewhere.

834
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,847
- I'd get plenty of that in my day as well.
- Way back in the day.

835
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,474
Listen.

836
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,477
You two both seem like two sweet,
doe-eyed people...

837
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,812
...about to have the worst year
of your lives.

838
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,941
I'll be honest with you.
Want to make jokes about tyranny hookers?

839
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,275
Go for it, I don't care.

840
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,070
You have no idea the types of families
that I deal with.

841
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:12,073
Tyranny hookers? They're my good cases.

842
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,908
The only obstacle here is you two...

843
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,078
...and whether or not you're both cut out
to be parents.

844
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:21,415
What we want to avoid is Sophie
losing more people that she's close to.

845
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:27,672
You know, your friends thought
you could do this, but I'll be honest...

846
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,882
...I'm not so sure.

847
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,138
How can I be hung-over
if I haven't even gone to sleep yet?

848
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,392
Look, all we have to do is put her down.
We just got to put her-

849
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,021
She's not warm. She doesn't have a fever.
She's just overtired.

850
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:47,066
- What time is it?
- It's okay, Soph. Come on, honey.

851
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,987
- I don't know. Start wearing a watch.
- There's got to be somebody we can call.

852
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,990
Hey, thank you for coming over.
It's okay.

853
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:57,451
Sorry about your dad.
He's a pretty scary dude, huh?

854
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,578
- Come here, Sophie.
- The baby whisperer.

855
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:00,788
It's okay.
- Yeah.

856
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:01,998
Thank you, Amy.

857
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,588
I don't know why,
but this fan always helps.

858
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,717
- Beats having to take her for a drive.
Yeah.

859
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,886
Anyway, big math test tomorrow, so...

860
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,140
Give her some money.

861
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,850
Oh, Amy, Amy.

862
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,146
It's okay.
Doesn't feel right to take it anymore.

863
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,439
Okay.

864
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,441
- Give her the money.
- No, I insist.

865
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,945
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

866
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,656
- Good luck on your math test.
- Okay, bye-bye.

867
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,784
- Oh, thank God. Whew.
- I know.

868
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,748
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no.

869
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,668
Too close. You're holding her too-
Look, you're going to chop her head off.

870
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:50,171
- That's what the babysitter was doing.
- She wasn't.

871
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,757
No, she was soothing her down here.

872
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,801
We're going to go for a drive.
We're going to drive around the block.

873
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,554
- Just go. Just go.
- Nice and quick. Nice and quick.

874
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,432
All right, we're just going to go
for a ride around the block.

875
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,642
We'll get back in time for the game, huh?

876
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,478
Yeah.

877
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,045
Hi.

878
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:35,007
Mm-hm. Absolutely.
Yeah, I'm on my way now. Okay.

879
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,843
Yeah, really, thank you so much.
All right, bye-bye.

880
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,512
Yes!

881
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,932
Yes. Burke's out, and I finally got the call
to direct today's game.

882
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,435
- Today is my Riverside event. I told you.
- You never told me that.

883
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,188
You just don't listen to women
who won't sleep with you.

884
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,816
See it there on the board?
I'll be home at 7:30.

885
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:54,443
Come on, I can't.
There are no kids in the booth.

886
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,862
- Come on, work with me here.
- It's on the board.

887
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,864
You have any idea
how big a game this is?

888
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,742
The Hawks are a game out
of the eighth seed in the East.

889
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,370
- Don't walk out that door.
- You're speaking Mandarin.

890
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,247
I've been planning this for months.

891
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,333
There are plenty of mommy and daddies
who are in love with you.

892
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,546
- Call them.
- Hey, Beth. It's Messer, from a- Yeah.

893
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:17,216
Hey, I was wondering if maybe you guys
could watch Sophie for a bit today.

894
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,344
I got a huge break.
I get to direct the Hawks game today.

895
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,471
Nope, Amy can't.
She's got a big math test.

896
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,016
Yeah, I tried Josh and Beth too.
They're all busy. Bye-bye.

897
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,227
Son of a...

898
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,983
It's a healthier meal
if you don't fry the shell.

899
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,610
You know what I'm saying?
I like my taco shells baked.

900
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,487
Yeah, I like them soft.
- Yeah.

901
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,157
All right, thank you for the ride, Walter.

902
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,702
Well, you called, I came.
That's how a man makes his money, baby.

903
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,412
What's up with my floor seats?

904
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,831
I'm going to give you two floor seats.

905
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,333
All you got to do
is keep that meter running for me.

906
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,543
- Okay.
- My man.

907
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,670
- We making another stop, baby?
- Yep.

908
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,089
- Okay. All right.
- Just not yet.

909
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,926
Not yet, not yet. The baby's in here.
You left the bab- You left the baby!

910
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,263
You left the baby! You left the bab-
You left the baby.

911
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,725
You left your baby.

912
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:11,770
Look, Walter, please, I got no choice.
I need your help, as a friend.

913
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,148
No, no, no.
You can't leave me with your baby.

914
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,109
Are you on crack?
I could be the baby cab killer.

915
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,485
I know all about you, man.

916
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,280
I know you keep a clean cab,
you drive the speed limit...

917
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,449
...and you got three kids
you love to death.

918
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,409
You know why? Because they're my kids.

919
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,662
I hate other people's kids.
That's your baby in there.

920
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,372
Whatever the meter is, triple it.

921
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,750
You'll be the best-paid babysitter
in the state.

922
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,460
Please.

923
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,839
- What if she wakes up?
- She's not going to wake up, I pro- Oh!

924
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,382
Look. It's her ducky.

925
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,136
- In case of an emergency.
- Better not be no emergencies.

926
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,679
- There won't be.
- Better not!

927
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,433
The final seconds of this first half...

928
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,519
Ready Camera 3. And go 3.

929
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,355
- feeding it off, and the basket...

930
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:59,318
- Simon, give me the scoring leaders, please.
- No one's ever said "please" to me before.

931
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,614
- Who's calling?
- It's the new sitter.

932
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:08,160
- Yeah?
- The baby woke up! The baby woke up.

933
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,247
Hey, there's this great game going on.
You should check it out.

934
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,166
Cameras 4 and 6,
4 ready by the ball, 2 by the basket.

935
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,419
Okay, sniff her butt.
See if she needs to be changed.

936
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:20,965
I'm not sniffing this baby's booty.
Man, what are you feeding this girl?

937
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:25,052
It's like a dirty bomb.
It's like eggs and peanut butter.

938
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,138
- I'll be down at halftime.
- Halftime? Are you crazy?

939
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:29,848
Halftime!

940
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,935
Okay, okay, okay, here we go, man.
Okay, okay. Oh, my God!

941
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,438
Okay. Okay. All right.
All right, we're halfway there, Walter.

942
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,565
- All right, here we go.
- No, no, no.

943
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,359
No, please, listen. Walter, please.

944
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,737
- Know what? Here. Take the whole wallet.
- I don't want your wallet.

945
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:47,658
You know what I want?
I want a nice, comfy seat inside...

946
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,326
...next to some big-screen TVs-

947
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,204
No kids in the booth. I'm sorry.
You got to sit out here.

948
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,290
- Baby want to see game?
- Baby doesn't want to.

949
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,666
Want to see game?

950
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,376
Baby want to see game.

951
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,386
Hey, everybody.

952
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,140
This is Sophie and her nanny, Walter.

953
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,893
Say hi.

954
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,770
All right, here you go.

955
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,565
Big cushy chair, new monitors.
Drinks are in the fridge.

956
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,317
No beer till after the game, okay?

957
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,695
Nice. I never seen a game like this before.
Now we're talking.

958
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,071
- So you're good?
- I'm good.

959
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,740
All right.

960
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,410
All right, people, second half.
Let's do this.

961
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:35,039
- Did you get him through a service?
- Uh, yep.

962
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,041
- Yeah?
- Yep.

963
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,418
- He's your cab driver, isn't he?
- Yep.

964
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,586
Yeah.

965
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,921
Twenty seconds to go, Hawks down by 1.

966
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:48,010
- No doubt they'll play for the last shot.
- All right, Camera 4, stay with Johnson.

967
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,804
Liz, tell Camera 4 to stay with Johnson.
Come on.

968
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,599
- I can barely hear you, Messer.
- A foul? Come on, man!

969
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,225
Okay, ready Camera 6.

970
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,312
- Walter, she's crying.
- I know, I'm trying to watch the game.

971
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,857
- You are the worst babysitter of all time.
- Because I'm not a babysitter.

972
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,109
Do something.
Please, I'm dying over here.

973
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,321
All right, Camera 2, stay with Bibby-
Johnson.

974
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,907
All right, stay with the shooter
on Camera 2-

975
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,367
No, I mean, Camera 1.

976
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,659
Stay on 1, 1, 1.

977
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,661
Camera 2, stay with the- Camera 1-

978
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,081
Alley-oop, and the Hawks win.

979
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:21,710
Unbelievable play by Atlanta.
Hawks win by 1.

980
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:26,173
Hands down, the best game of the year.
Too bad you all couldn't see it.

981
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,431
But I'm a creep

982
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,229
I'm a weirdo

983
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,774
- What the hell-?
- What are you singing to her?

984
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,527
Everybody likes Radiohead.

985
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,321
Do you mind?

986
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,451
What the hell am I doing here?

987
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,163
I don't belong here

988
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,334
Mmm, mmm

989
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:03,961
See?

990
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,088
Told you it works.

991
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,473
Would it kill you to-?

992
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,475
- Shh.
- You shh!

993
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,978
Would it kill you
to brighten the mood around here?

994
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,312
- Yeah, it might.
- Come on.

995
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,941
Why should I pretend to be happy?
I'm miserable. Let me be miserable.

996
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,568
- It's depressing.
- I don't care.

997
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,863
Know what? I am so sick
of all your dark little comments.

998
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,197
I ruined my life for her.

999
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:35,451
I'm so sorry parenting isn't as fun
as you thought it was going to be.

1000
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,078
Yeah, you're happy
because your old life sucked.

1001
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,872
- My old life didn't suck.
- It did.

1002
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,708
My life was great.
I was my own boss, I made my own hours.

1003
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,918
- I had free time.
- To do what? Bake more?

1004
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,171
- God.
- You have no idea what a great life is.

1005
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,882
I had a great life.
I went to games for a living.

1006
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,801
Okay? Girls would buy me drinks
and throw themselves at me.

1007
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,971
You see this shirt?
I slept with the girl who sold me this shirt.

1008
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,181
You're disgusting.

1009
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,225
People say you can't have it all.
I had it all. It was awesome.

1010
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:04,104
Of course you think that's awesome,
because all you care about is getting laid.

1011
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,898
Even Peter was embarrassed by you.

1012
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:10,110
He just never said anything to your face
because he was twice the man you are.

1013
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,404
You should get laid yourself.

1014
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,822
Except to have sex...

1015
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,325
...you got to find somebody
who can stand you first.

1016
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,913
Fuck you.

1017
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,175
You shouldn't ride
a motorcycle. Your kid's parents died-

1018
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,302
She is not my kid.

1019
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,348
She's not my kid.

1020
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,226
Then whose kid is she?

1021
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,850
We'll do this again. One, two-

1022
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,734
I'm sorry, Messer.

1023
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,904
- I didn't mean it.
- It's all right.

1024
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:29,291
You know, I broke my back when I was 17.
I was almost paralyzed.

1025
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:34,004
And Pete spent that whole summer
with me in my room...

1026
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,632
...watching movies every day.

1027
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:41,428
All my friends went out to the beach
or went off to chase girls...

1028
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,640
...but he just sat there with me
the whole time.

1029
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,851
I can't leave him alone
when he needs me.

1030
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,978
Even if he's gone.

1031
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,984
I dug up some of their old home movies
because, you know, I was just...

1032
01:00:56,152 --> 01:01:00,739
I just wanted to hear their voices,
see them a minute, you know?

1033
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,660
And I found this one,
and you've got to see this.

1034
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:08,163
Ta-da. Ha-ha-ha.

1035
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:13,502
Pretty great, huh? I went with the lavender
and then the blue sky, like we talked about.

1036
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,047
- When did you paint this room?
- I did it when you were at the hospital.

1037
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,341
You were supposed to do it three days ago.

1038
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,926
It smells like paint fumes in here.

1039
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:24,096
It's been drying for 12 hours.
- It has not been drying long enough.

1040
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:27,474
- You're getting so critical.
- She can't sleep in the bedroom tonight.

1041
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,602
It's not even wet.
I wouldn't bring a baby into a wet room.

1042
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,314
Of course it's not wet, but you
think it doesn't smell for days afterwards?

1043
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:37,943
It doesn't. It's totally aired out.
You know how much work I put into this?

1044
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:42,447
You didn't do any of this.
When have you painted a cloud in your life?

1045
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,242
- I oversaw the work that was being done.
- You oversaw it?

1046
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,661
The one thing you said you would do,
you oversaw?

1047
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,914
I got creative. The guy came in,
and I said, "Let's do the clouds. "

1048
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,959
- This is ridiculous. She can't sleep here.
- Of course she can.

1049
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,378
- Move the crib.
- This is her room. Where else-?

1050
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,172
So you're saying it's okay
that we're horrible parents...

1051
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,341
...and want to kill each other half the time.

1052
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,010
- Two-thirds, actually.
- Yep.

1053
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:08,473
I think we have to just stop trying
to fit ourselves into their lives.

1054
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:13,145
You know, I hate this place.
It's like a mausoleum in here.

1055
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,106
You know,
there's pictures of them everywhere.

1056
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,610
And I really hate that cowboy painting.

1057
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,989
- He's really creepy, right?
- Yeah. I want it out.

1058
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,534
If we're going to live here,
we have to stop tiptoeing around...

1059
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:31,246
...like they're coming back soon.
They're not coming back.

1060
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,530
This side has to- No.

1061
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,115
That good right there?
- No.

1062
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,493
- Looks good right there.
- Okay, like that.

1063
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:37,979
Morning, Messer.

1064
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,399
Morning...

1065
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,567
...Jill.

1066
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,701
- Oh, and thank you for dinner.
- Yeah.

1067
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:55,956
- And next time it's my treat.
- Oh, God.

1068
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:59,167
Right foot, left foot. Right foot, left foot.

1069
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,419
- Let's see some walking.
- Would you stop that?

1070
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,089
She'll walk when she's got
somewhere to go, all right?

1071
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:07,092
All the books say she should be walking
or talking by now...

1072
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,677
...and she's not doing either.

1073
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,930
All the books also say
that you should be married with 2.2 kids...

1074
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,265
...and look at your life.

1075
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:16,393
That poor girl thinks
that she's going to dinner with you.

1076
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,145
What's the alternative?
"Bye, I'll never see you again"?

1077
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,731
- That would be mean.
- Where do you meet these women?

1078
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:24,526
I mean, if you're not with me and Sophie,
you're at work.

1079
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,571
- I have my methods.
- Huh. Interesting.

1080
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:41,042
Switch it up. There we go. Oh, there it is.

1081
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:44,546
Okay. Oh, like a rubber band.

1082
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,093
- Limbering up?
- How you doing, good-looking?

1083
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,012
Oh, right back at you.

1084
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,222
Hey, big man.
- Hey, Ted.

1085
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,975
- Hey, you see that game last night?
- Which game?

1086
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,813
- Boo!
- Oh, my God.

1087
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,356
I didn't mean to scare you.

1088
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:05,984
- I didn't know you were a runner.
- Yep.

1089
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,486
We should train together. Yeah.

1090
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:12,324
- Well, I like to use this time to think.
- Oh, yeah, me too. I like to think.

1091
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:16,036
Is this the pace we're going to keep up?
It's a little brisk.

1092
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,080
I still don't understand
all these extra costs.

1093
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,666
The job's been more complicated
than we anticipated.

1094
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,960
Oh, more complicated
than anticipated, yeah.

1095
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,796
My life has been more complicated
than anticipated.

1096
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,174
I didn't anticipate somebody
handing me a baby-

1097
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,717
- Ms. Berenson?
- Yes?

1098
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:35,430
Ah. Sorry. Hello, lady. What you doing?
Can you just give me one minute?

1099
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,601
Hey, Lonnie? Keep a better eye on her.
She's crawling around back there.

1100
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,062
- It's a construction site.
- A baby that crawls?

1101
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,147
- Just take her.
- I can't. Doing something.

1102
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,316
- Please.
- Can't. Big basket.

1103
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,486
- Can you help me out?
- You look beautiful with the baby, though.

1104
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:53,073
Doesn't she look good with-?
That's a beautiful baby. Like an accessory.

1105
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,282
Smooth.

1106
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,118
Go, Wonder Pets. Yay!

1107
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,413
Wow, that was a really good episode.

1108
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,542
What I like about Ming-Ming
is that even though they lost the game...

1109
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:09,339
...she really learned something valuable
about teamwork, you know?

1110
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,675
I didn't see that one coming.
How about-?

1111
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,719
Holly. Stay right- You stay right-

1112
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:18,556
Holly, Holly, Holly! She's standing!
She's about to walk! Get down here!

1113
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,017
- What? Now?
- Hurry up!

1114
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:24,729
- She can't walk now! She can't walk now!
- She's about to. Get down here.

1115
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,272
Okay, wait. Stay right there.

1116
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,983
- Wait, I'm coming.
- Hurry up!

1117
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,402
- She's walking! Hurry up!
- Stall her. I'm coming.

1118
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:34,656
- I'm coming! Just stall her. Stall her!
- I can't- How do you want me to stall her?

1119
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,117
- How do I stall her?
- Just stall her!

1120
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,452
Don't you take that step.
Please, don't take-

1121
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,872
- What do you want me to-?
- Ow! Oh, God, oh, God, I'm coming.

1122
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,793
- Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Okay. What did you do?

1123
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,338
You told me to stall her, so I just-
I gave her a little shove.

1124
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,717
I asked you to stall her, Messer,
not traumatize her.

1125
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:57,053
- Now she'll never walk.
- Okay, this is not my fault.

1126
01:06:57,221 --> 01:07:00,682
- What did the bad man do, huh?
- Pretty sure it was your fault.

1127
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:28,043
Hold on. Okay, go ahead.

1128
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:36,968
- Are those homemade noodles?
- Yes.

1129
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,429
She's the only person
who doesn't like my cooking.

1130
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,097
Now it's personal.

1131
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,599
Come on.

1132
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,227
One bite.

1133
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,524
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I did it!
She ate it!

1134
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:55,236
She ate my cooking, she ate my cooking,
she ate my cooking!

1135
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,446
I'm that good.

1136
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,932
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1137
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,851
This is why you are always so happy
to run to the store.

1138
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:30,855
This is where you pick up women.
You use Sophie to get laid.

1139
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:33,149
She's got to pay back somehow.
Isn't that right?

1140
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:36,611
- No free lunch, right, Soph?
- I want to see it.

1141
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,155
- See what?
- I want to see you work your Messer magic.

1142
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:41,032
You want me to pick you up? Here?

1143
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,536
Yes. I want you to loop around
and pretend I'm one of those gym girls.

1144
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,663
I'm not going to pretend to pick you up.

1145
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:49,833
- I want to get home.
- Uch. You're such a killjoy.

1146
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,918
Hey.

1147
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,881
You know what? I read about these.
They're really good for kids, but I can't-

1148
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,092
- How do you pronounce it? ""?
- "aa.s.e."

1149
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,552
- "Aa"?
- Mm-hm.

1150
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,761
Oh.

1151
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,764
You must really have an ear
for languages, huh?

1152
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:05,974
No, not really.

1153
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:10,103
I took Spanish all through high school.
I did pretty well. Got good grades.

1154
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,358
Oh, you're good. You're very good.

1155
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,569
- You see that?
- I see how this works for you.

1156
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,320
Holly?

1157
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,532
Oh! It's Sam. It's Sophie's doctor, Sam.

1158
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,118
- Sam? You call him Sam?
- Hey, Sophie.

1159
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,744
- Dr. Nelson.
- Hi. Sam.

1160
01:09:26,912 --> 01:09:29,998
- Hey, I'm Messer. Nice to meet you.
- Messer, nice to meet you too.

1161
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,749
- Is this your...?
- No, no, no.

1162
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:35,295
- No.
- We're not... We just...

1163
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:36,963
Sounds complicated.

1164
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,798
- We raise Sophie together.
- Yes.

1165
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:42,302
You know, Holly's mentioned how much
she really likes Sophie's doctor...

1166
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:43,803
...a few times, actually.

1167
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,598
So I thought she meant
you were good with kids, but now-

1168
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:49,309
Can you just walk away?
Can you just give me a minute?

1169
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:53,229
- I'm all right here.
- Give me a minute. Thank you.

1170
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:56,524
Sometimes Sophie is more of a grown-up.

1171
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,527
So how's this work between you two?

1172
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,740
- You split up most of the work?
- Yes. We have charts. A very big chart.

1173
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,033
- Chart?
- Yeah.

1174
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,910
That chart give you any time off?

1175
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,662
Yes, Monday, Wednesday
and every other Friday.

1176
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,080
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1177
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:14,000
- Will you have Sophie this Friday?
- No.

1178
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,835
Eight o'clock Friday?
- Great.

1179
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:18,129
- My office has your information?
- They sure do.

1180
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,048
- I'll call you up.
- Perfect. Okay.

1181
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:25,136
You are so right,
this is such a great place to meet people.

1182
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:30,975
What time does Dr. Love get here?
- Any minute. Stop calling him that.

1183
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:34,729
I can't believe he asked you out.
Doesn't that defy some doctor-patient thing?

1184
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,899
He's a pediatrician, so if he's dating
a patient, there'd be a problem.

1185
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,610
If you have sex, is he going to tell you
what percentile you're at?

1186
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,324
- Hi.
- Hey. Wow, you look...

1187
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,038
Oh, I'd better not say anything.
Best to keep a couple cards off the table.

1188
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,791
- Hey, Messer.
- Hey. How you doing, doc?

1189
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,293
- Thanks for giving her the night off.
- All right.

1190
01:10:57,461 --> 01:10:59,754
You know,
she tried on everything in her closet.

1191
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,675
- Pretty much impossible to blow this one.
- Okay, Messer. We'll just go.

1192
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,344
- She hasn't had any for a while-
- Oh, my God, stop it.

1193
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,221
Call me if you need me.

1194
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,351
You know, if you wanted to kill me...

1195
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,688
...there were dumpsters on my side of town
that were a lot closer.

1196
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,690
You don't like to be surprised, do you?

1197
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:22,193
Well, I'm a little bit
of a control freak, so...

1198
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,989
There we are.
- Okay. Backstage at a concert.

1199
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,283
- I'm just not that cool.
- No?

1200
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:31,828
We're not going to Aerosmith
or Justin Bieber?

1201
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:33,871
This is...

1202
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,625
Le Mare.

1203
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,212
The owner and executive chef
has three girls, so...

1204
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,798
- You treat Phillipe Le Mare's kids?
- I do.

1205
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,550
- Oh, my God.
Dr. Nelson.

1206
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,927
- Phillipe.
- Sam, hey. Phillipe Le Mare.

1207
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:50,054
- Such a pleasure.
- No, no, pleasure's mine.

1208
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:53,266
- Special setup right here. Come on.
So how are the beautiful girls?

1209
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,643
They're very healthy.
They have a good doctor.

1210
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:59,731
You know,
I don't do a lot of dinner dates, really.

1211
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:00,982
What about you?

1212
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,027
No? You know what?

1213
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:07,363
Why don't we just relax and get
to know each other? What do you say?

1214
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:11,701
So you live around here?

1215
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,119
Upstairs?

1216
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,621
I just live right around the corner
in the TV room.

1217
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:18,583
You know, I knew I'd seen you
somewhere around here.

1218
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:22,545
Excellent choice in the crushed watermelon,
by the way.

1219
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,922
I'm sorry if I'm a little nervous.

1220
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,508
It's just that I don't usually
meet babies like you.

1221
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,594
To be honest, I...

1222
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,263
Well, I like older women.

1223
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,601
Well, not that much older.

1224
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,942
You are getting warmer, kiddo.

1225
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,949
- I can't believe you've never come here.
- I never used to eat out much.

1226
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:55,953
My ex-wife, she would cook,
so we stayed home a lot.

1227
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:58,331
- You were married?
- You like how I snuck that in there?

1228
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,083
Mm. Clever.

1229
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,961
- I'm so sorry. I thought I turned it off.
- That's okay.

1230
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,799
Messer, I get one night off.

1231
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,635
Look, I'm not calling for you,
I'm calling for Dr. Love.

1232
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,887
Okay. All right, hold on.

1233
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:16,557
I'm sorry, he wants to talk to you.
It must be a Sophie question.

1234
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,142
Hey.

1235
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,520
It could be a couple things.

1236
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:25,691
Take her down to the ER at St. Augustus.
It's Friday, so Dr. Mooney's on call.

1237
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:28,486
I'll tell him you're on your way.
You won't have to wait.

1238
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:32,573
We'll see you there in about an hour. Okay.
Sophie's temperature spiked.

1239
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,992
They're going to need an hour,
so I was hoping-

1240
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,786
We got to go.

1241
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,039
Or we could go.

1242
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,834
Great. Thank you.

1243
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,637
So Sophie's got a urinary-tract infection.
We're going to put her on an antibiotic drip.

1244
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,306
That gets the medication
into her system a bit faster.

1245
01:13:57,474 --> 01:14:00,685
I'll stop back by first thing in the morning
and check up on her.

1246
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:04,397
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

1247
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:08,109
Yeah, I was kind of looking forward
to dropping you home.

1248
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:12,029
I had rehearsed this whole thing
in my mind.

1249
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,916
That was even better than I rehearsed it.

1250
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,294
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

1251
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:29,297
Thank you again.

1252
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:36,554
Hey, her temp's coming down.

1253
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,806
Clothes, daycare, monthly food bill...

1254
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,559
...and now a $1200 bill
from the emergency room.

1255
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,854
If something happens to the car,
one of us is going to sell a kidney.

1256
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:47,231
Having a kid is expensive.
We talked about that.

1257
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:50,610
Having kids and an expanding shop,
it's a bit much.

1258
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,904
Where'd you get the flowers?

1259
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:56,324
Oh. Sam sent them today.
I haven't even called him back yet.

1260
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,077
I mean, how can I? I'm a disaster.
I can't be this girl on the second date.

1261
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,830
This is what you save for marriage.
Like 10 years in.

1262
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,999
Don't stress about the money.
We'll be fine.

1263
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:07,793
I'll just call Lonnie
and we'll patch up the wall...

1264
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:10,922
...and maybe in a few years,
we can revisit it or something.

1265
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,591
Wait, so you're going to pull the plug
on the remodel?

1266
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:16,552
I can't increase the construction loan.
It's okay, you know?

1267
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,764
I'll just have a shop and not a restaurant.
It's fine.

1268
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,766
It'll be okay.

1269
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,648
You know, I can give you the money.

1270
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,611
- I have savings.
- No. No, I can't let you do that.

1271
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,821
- I would never take your savings.
- I want to.

1272
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,658
We're raising a kid together.
We have this house together.

1273
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:40,159
This is just part of it.

1274
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,663
Look, having somebody help you
doesn't mean that you failed.

1275
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:46,541
It just means that you're not in it alone.

1276
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,126
Um...

1277
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,548
Okay, but it can't be a gift.
I won't take it unless it's an investment.

1278
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,716
Fine. I'm an investor in Fraiche.

1279
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:56,968
You're...

1280
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:58,928
You're an investor in "Fraiche. "

1281
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,638
- "Fraiche. " Sorry.
- "Fraiche. "

1282
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,848
That entitles you to 2 percent of profits.

1283
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:04,183
- Three percent.
- Two.

1284
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,936
And, hey, a discount on food and wine.

1285
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:08,437
- Discount?
- Ten percent.

1286
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,856
- Fifteen percent.
- Ten percent.

1287
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:12,441
It's a great discount.

1288
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:16,153
- Then you throw in dinner.
- Oh, deal.

1289
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,738
- All right.
- Awesome. Okay.

1290
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,866
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
That's huge.

1291
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:24,328
Okay, dinner, tonight, on me.
You and me.

1292
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,711
Hello.

1293
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,505
- You look so pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

1294
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,302
Oh, my God.

1295
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:41,554
- Hey.
- Hey.

1296
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:44,432
So here are all the numbers.

1297
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,977
My cell phone, his cell phone,
the restaurant and the pediatrician.

1298
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:49,562
Yep.

1299
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:53,774
You know you actually have to
leave the house for me to do my job?

1300
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:54,984
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1301
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,278
- Okay. All right.
- Okay. All right.

1302
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:00,448
- Okay, have fun.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1303
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,890
This place is amazing, Holly.
I can't believe I haven't been here before.

1304
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:29,602
Look at you. You're a kitchen ninja.

1305
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:33,397
- You don't follow any kind of a recipe?
- No.

1306
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:37,568
This is the only place in life
where I do not follow a plan.

1307
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,783
You got under five minutes. No.

1308
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,619
I was technically awake.

1309
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:55,628
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- A bet's a bet. I can do this.

1310
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,422
- You don't have to.
- You know what I'm not sure about?

1311
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,759
The helmet. It's lame.
I want something with thunderbolts on it.

1312
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,511
We're going to pull out the choke.

1313
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,720
- The what?
- The choke.

1314
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:05,930
- Okay.
- All right?

1315
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:09,725
Turn on the ignition, pull in the clutch.
Here. Hold that in. Hold that in.

1316
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:12,228
- Okay.
- Push the starter button.

1317
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,437
All right, there we go.

1318
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:16,524
All right, left hand is the clutch,
right hand is the throttle.

1319
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,068
- Okay.
- All right, let's get your kickstand up.

1320
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,778
Oh, I'm on a freaking motorcycle!

1321
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:24,115
Easy there, Rain Man. We're not done?
Now we're in first gear.

1322
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:25,366
- Okay.
- Hold that.

1323
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,369
- Don't let go of that clutch till I get on-
- Let go?

1324
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,455
- Oh, my God.
- No.

1325
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:37,878
Oh, my God. Oh, Messer.
Oh, Messer, I'm so sorry.

1326
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,464
- No, it's okay. Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1327
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,509
Oh!

1328
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:47,930
Oh, no.

1329
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,267
Oh, no. Are you mad?

1330
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,686
No, I'm just- I'm going to sit down.

1331
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,272
I thought you said, "Let go. "

1332
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,651
Do you want me to go talk
to the bus driver maybe?

1333
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,826
- God, I am so sorry, Messer.
- Don't worry about it.

1334
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,537
- I'm going to pay for it, I promise.
- I'm actually in awe.

1335
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:14,498
You didn't even drive it a foot
before you destroyed it.

1336
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:18,836
- I feel so bad. I'm really sorry.
- It's fine. Okay?

1337
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,796
It's just a bike.

1338
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,174
Do you mean that,
or are you just saying that...

1339
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:26,010
...because you think if I keep talking,
you're going to cry?

1340
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,845
Get inside.

1341
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:31,348
- Hi.
Hi.

1342
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:35,978
I didn't want to move her.

1343
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:37,938
That's okay.

1344
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:42,109
Amy, wait a second.

1345
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:45,196
Here you go. Now, come on, no backsies.

1346
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,616
- Thanks, Amy.
- Thank you. Bye-bye. Have a good night.

1347
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,245
I think you guys
make a really cute couple.

1348
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:01,420
She said the same thing about Taylor Swift
and that Twilight kid.

1349
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,975
Oh, my God, we're in their room.

1350
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:57,935
It's not so scary.

1351
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,770
- This room is beautiful.
- Yeah.

1352
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:02,231
- How come we haven't used it at all?
- I have no idea.

1353
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,024
What thread count are these sheets? Ooh!

1354
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,487
You think they planned this?

1355
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,322
What?

1356
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:13,659
Us? No. No.

1357
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:17,288
They tried that once before.
We know how that worked out.

1358
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:21,208
Well, I kind of get it now.

1359
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,544
What, why they set us up?

1360
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,089
Yeah, I never understood it before,
but now that I know you better...

1361
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,800
...I can see what Alison was thinking.

1362
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,969
You have a lot in common with her.

1363
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,138
- With Alison?
- Yeah.

1364
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:38,475
You'd think it would be Peter,
but it's her you remind me more of.

1365
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,650
She was just so fun and easygoing,
you know?

1366
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:55,326
- I have a surprise.
- What?

1367
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,747
- Something I found earlier.
- What?

1368
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,710
- A little contraband.
- Oh, my God, no.

1369
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,503
- What do you mean, no?
- We can't.

1370
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:08,964
- Sophie is asleep in the next room.
- She's asleep.

1371
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,758
Come on,
it'll help us stave off glaucoma.

1372
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,179
- No.
- Come on.

1373
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,057
No. Absolutely not.

1374
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:21,185
We cannot smoke that.

1375
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:31,445
Don't.

1376
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,209
- Why are you leaving them?
- I'm just taking a few.

1377
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,961
We're not going to eat all these.

1378
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:50,172
All right. Come on, let's go.
What are we watching?

1379
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:54,218
Jump in the car

1380
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,428
And buckle up

1381
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,556
You know there was five Wiggles
originally?

1382
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:00,891
I was the fifth Wiggle.

1383
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:02,184
Jump in the car

1384
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:04,478
Put on my seat belt

1385
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:07,231
And we can ride the whole day long

1386
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:10,609
- Oh! That's neat. How do you do that?
- Like a wiggle.

1387
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:13,487
- Am I doing it? Am I doing it?
- That's good.

1388
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,997
This is inappropriate for children.

1389
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:26,792
MEN
The shining moon sees no sunlight

1390
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:30,254
The sun sees no moonbeams

1391
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:34,717
- So the moon and the sun are friends?
- They're best friends.

1392
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:38,429
They're in each other's dreams

1393
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,283
What? Who?

1394
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,328
- Hello?
- That's the baby monitor.

1395
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:04,997
Oh, where's the phone?

1396
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:07,332
- I think it's the door.
- I'll get the door.

1397
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,713
Oh, good morning, Mr. Messer.
I hope this isn't too inconvenient a time.

1398
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:16,467
No, no, no, this is perfect.
Just give us one minute.

1399
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:19,053
Actually, it's rather warm outside.
I'd love to-

1400
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,637
Yay, yay, yay!

1401
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:22,848
- Hey, Janine is here.
- What? Now?

1402
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,476
- God, that lady has the worst timing.
- Come on.

1403
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:28,353
You take Sophie.
I'll clean upstairs, you clean downstairs.

1404
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:30,731
- And get the illicit drugs.
- Okay.

1405
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:59,343
Okay, okay, okay. We didn't smoke it.

1406
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,678
- I got a little carried away.
- You ready? Okay.

1407
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:03,347
- Where's Sophie?
- Where's Sophie?

1408
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,515
So-?

1409
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:10,646
There we go. All right, there we go.

1410
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,065
Well, you seem more settled in your roles.

1411
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,942
Yeah, yeah. We have learned a lot.

1412
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,861
And so has Miss Sophie.
She's walking now.

1413
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:21,115
So how are you two getting along?
Is there any tension?

1414
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:22,908
- Us?
- Why would there be tension?

1415
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:26,203
- Everything's fantastic.
- Everything's all good, good, good.

1416
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:29,039
Have you thought
about how you're going to make this work...

1417
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,041
...or what your plans might be together?

1418
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,044
We hadn't really gotten that far.
It's still pretty new.

1419
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:38,465
And some things just happened
with no plan at all.

1420
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:41,343
Really?
Because I kind of had a plan in mind.

1421
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:45,347
Really? It just never occurred to me
that you had any interest in my plans.

1422
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,766
How could you not know
I wanted to plan with you?

1423
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:50,060
Maybe I'm not as experienced a planner
as you.

1424
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:53,689
- I think you're a good planner.
- Oh, come on, people, you had sex.

1425
01:25:56,025 --> 01:25:57,067
Huh?

1426
01:25:57,235 --> 01:26:01,655
We have no intention of letting our personal
lives affect our parenting, I promise.

1427
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,824
- You going to get married?
Ha, ha.

1428
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:08,078
- This happened, what, six hours ago?
- That's a little specific. I don't know if she-

1429
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:11,248
What if it doesn't work out?
Are you going to sleep in the garage?

1430
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:15,627
Sex in this situation, it's like termites.
It makes for a very unstable household.

1431
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:19,923
You were supposed to be my easy case.
I got a nice coffee on the way here.

1432
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:24,011
I thought, "Gonna deal with my easy case,
going to make it like a little vacation. Yay!"

1433
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,929
- Look, Janine, it-
Now, oh, my God.

1434
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:29,683
We have one more meeting scheduled.
Before then, work out your personal issues.

1435
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:32,978
Whether you decide to get engaged
or pretend it never happened...

1436
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:34,438
...I don't care.

1437
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:37,524
Just work your shit out, okay?

1438
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,067
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.

1439
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:45,490
- Do you mind if I snag a brownie?
- Oh, God, no. No, no, no.

1440
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,160
Oh, really, I'm so sorry.

1441
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:50,662
It's a bad batch,
and I'm a professional baker.

1442
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:54,416
No, it's okay. Your house, your food.
Anyway, so I'm sorry. I'm out of here.

1443
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:55,792
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.

1444
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,753
- Are you-?
- It's okay. Thank you.

1445
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,134
You're my last single friend.

1446
01:27:04,302 --> 01:27:06,303
Without you,
I have no link to the outside.

1447
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:10,349
Look, I don't know why we did it.
We just... We just did.

1448
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:14,519
Do you know what marriage is like?
Imagine a prison.

1449
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:17,105
- And then don't change anything.
- We're not married.

1450
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:21,193
You guys are raising a kid together.
That's the most married you can get.

1451
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,861
Messer.

1452
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:25,239
- Minute?
- Oh, yeah.

1453
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:30,327
So I gave you a nice big fat break.

1454
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,246
That didn't go so well.

1455
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:35,624
Should I learn my lesson with you,
or should I give you another shot?

1456
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:38,919
Given a choice,
I'd go with that one, the shot.

1457
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,213
You get it better
than just about anybody here.

1458
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,715
Sports isn't just about stats
and memorizing plays.

1459
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:46,009
It's about insight, it's about feeling.

1460
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:48,595
You got the talent,
but you are all over the place.

1461
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:50,055
I can be in one place, Alan.

1462
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:51,723
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1463
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:53,100
Can you be in Phoenix?

1464
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:55,852
A spot opened up directing for the Suns.

1465
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,689
They called,
asked who I thought was right for the job.

1466
01:27:58,856 --> 01:28:00,440
I'd like to tell them you.

1467
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,611
Let me know.

1468
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:15,289
JOSH
Every time I think of you

1469
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,043
I always catch my breath

1470
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:25,799
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away

1471
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:28,218
Somebody's getting along pretty good.

1472
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:30,887
Mmm. Two cats in heat.

1473
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:33,348
Ooh. Look at her. Frisky kitty.

1474
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:36,977
That's too casual.
I'll tell you this, they totally did it.

1475
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,313
I don't think so. I honestly don't think so.

1476
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,482
She bet me $400 that they were going to
sleep together by Labor Day.

1477
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:46,153
- That's why you're saying that.
- I feel like I'm watching CSI: Relationship.

1478
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:50,574
If me at any age of my life could see me,
he would kick my cat ass, you know that?

1479
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:54,161
Uh-oh. Messer owes you a quarter, he does.
He said a bad word.

1480
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,414
Messer. I heard you lived around here.

1481
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:58,790
Ben, hey.

1482
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:02,044
Sweet move, landing Phoenix.
We're going to miss you around the arena.

1483
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:05,714
- We're still talking about that.
- Alan said it seemed like a done deal.

1484
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:08,425
We're going to be over at the band in a bit.
Meet you there.

1485
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:09,843
Nice whiskers.

1486
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,014
What was that about?

1487
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:17,100
Nothing. Come on, let's go, let's go.

1488
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:19,770
- Come on. Okay.
- Thank you.

1489
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:22,230
Come on, Messer, out with it.

1490
01:29:22,398 --> 01:29:25,067
It's just something Alan and I talked about
the other day.

1491
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:28,153
He put me up for a directing job. It's...

1492
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,738
- In Phoenix.
- For the Suns.

1493
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:33,700
- Running their whole crew for the season.
- You said no, though, right?

1494
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:37,287
Well, I didn't want to be rude
and just turn it down right on the spot.

1495
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,040
- So why didn't you tell me about it?
- Because I didn't-

1496
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:43,627
I don't know, I didn't want it to be a thing.
It's not like I can take it.

1497
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:46,129
- But you want to.
- Well, of course I want to.

1498
01:29:46,297 --> 01:29:49,341
- It's a huge opportunity.
- So you're thinking about it.

1499
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:52,010
- No.
- No?

1500
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:53,804
No, I'm not thinking about it.

1501
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,724
I don't understand
why you didn't just mention it to me.

1502
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:01,311
Because I didn't want you to get upset,
which you obviously are.

1503
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:03,980
Why would I be upset
if it's not even a possibility?

1504
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:07,401
Know what, Mess? Can you just stop
with the food for one minute?

1505
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,987
Can you just tell me honestly,
are you thinking about taking this job?

1506
01:30:13,324 --> 01:30:15,826
Yeah. I'm thinking about it.

1507
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:18,328
This is something
that I've been working for, okay?

1508
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,331
I would've jumped
at this opportunity before.

1509
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:22,791
Before Sophie and before me?

1510
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,670
I get it. Come on. Come here, bugaboo.

1511
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,005
- Holly. Holl-
- Hey, bugaboos. Hello, bugaboos.

1512
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:30,632
How was this going to work exactly?

1513
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,135
Were we going to go with you,
or were you going to leave?

1514
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:35,679
I don't know.
I never had to think for three people.

1515
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,557
I barely had to think for one.
It's just a job offer, okay?

1516
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:42,018
No, it's not, it's exactly what
you've been waiting for, a clean out.

1517
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,604
- That's not true.
- You have never wanted to be here.

1518
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:47,732
And after everything,
you still think of us as temporary.

1519
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,359
You think that I'm not in this?

1520
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,737
I gave up my place,
I gave up my motorcycle, I gave you money.

1521
01:30:52,905 --> 01:30:55,699
- I never asked you for money.
- I did it to make you happy.

1522
01:30:55,867 --> 01:30:58,285
I gave up everything
to play this frigging part.

1523
01:30:58,911 --> 01:31:01,079
"Play this part"?

1524
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:02,914
That's what this is to you.

1525
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:05,792
Well, we're living in their house,
we're raising their kid.

1526
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,503
We're acting like we're married,
but we're not.

1527
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:12,257
- Have you been pretending with Sophie?
- No, I love Sophie.

1528
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:13,967
So just me, then.

1529
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:19,055
You should take the job, Messer.

1530
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:31,568
I know. I'm sorry.

1531
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:37,949
I'm sorry.

1532
01:32:21,827 --> 01:32:24,496
I'm coming, Soph.
I'm coming, honey, hold on.

1533
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:26,790
Okay.

1534
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:29,626
Oh.

1535
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:33,171
I knew you'd be up to your eyeballs
in egg whites, so I just grabbed her.

1536
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:34,381
- Thanks.
- There you go.

1537
01:32:35,258 --> 01:32:39,135
Good morning, Miss Soph. I missed you.

1538
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:42,138
You slept so good last night.
Can you say "apple"?

1539
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:43,473
Apple.

1540
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,016
Banana.

1541
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:47,852
I always sound like Antonio Banderas
when I do that.

1542
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,605
Banana.

1543
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:52,274
All right.

1544
01:32:52,441 --> 01:32:55,694
I'd love to sit and eat,
but I got the Finister twins coming in...

1545
01:32:55,861 --> 01:33:00,323
...and if I'm even a minute late, they will
redecorate my waiting room, again.

1546
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:03,201
- I'll see you later?
- Mm-hm.

1547
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:05,412
Wait, take a muffin.

1548
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,998
Thanks. Bye, Sophie.

1549
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,208
- Bye.
- Bye.

1550
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:25,890
And the Phoenix Suns' Steve Nash to a...

1551
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:29,352
Greg, ready that cutaway. Roll it.

1552
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:30,520
Take it.

1553
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:36,526
Weirdo

1554
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:40,530
What the hell am I doing here?

1555
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:06,848
Thank you.

1556
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:16,775
- Thanks.
Oh, look.

1557
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:18,860
Wow.

1558
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:23,031
Oh, look at you.
My goodness, you're getting so big.

1559
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:26,409
- She's huge, right?
- That iChat doesn't do her justice.

1560
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:29,454
- "Messer. " Can you say "Messer"?
- Oh, good luck with that.

1561
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:31,498
- Still no "Holly," huh?
- Nope.

1562
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:35,627
You know what it's like to be outranked
by "cup," "pool," and "giraffe"?

1563
01:34:35,795 --> 01:34:39,422
Okay, so we are all set for Monday.

1564
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,175
Janine actually broke tradition
and scheduled something.

1565
01:34:42,551 --> 01:34:46,096
So you really did kill the expansion, huh?
That's too bad.

1566
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:49,974
Yeah, we were like this before
and we were fine, so...

1567
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,727
All right, you ready?

1568
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:54,729
See you.

1569
01:34:54,897 --> 01:34:56,606
- Have fun.
- Okay.

1570
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,402
- Hey, Mess?
- Yeah?

1571
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:02,821
I don't know
if you have any plans or not...

1572
01:35:02,988 --> 01:35:05,782
...but, well, Sam and I
are hosting a Thanksgiving dinner...

1573
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,826
...and the neighbors are going to be there.

1574
01:35:07,993 --> 01:35:11,287
They keep asking about you,
so I don't know, maybe you want to join us.

1575
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:12,539
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1576
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,998
- Yeah, what the hell.
- Okay.

1577
01:35:14,166 --> 01:35:15,625
- All right. You're cooking?
- Yes.

1578
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:17,794
- All right. I'll see you there.
- Great.

1579
01:35:17,962 --> 01:35:19,254
Say goodbye. There we go.

1580
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,806
- Mmm.
- You think?

1581
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:32,308
You don't think it needs more nutmeg?

1582
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:35,895
You are no help.

1583
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:38,481
I'll get it.

1584
01:35:42,653 --> 01:35:44,738
Whoa, settle down.

1585
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:46,698
- Hey.
- Hi.

1586
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:48,992
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, you too.

1587
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,744
- I got you a little wine.
- Thanks.

1588
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,495
- Nine bucks.
- Wow.

1589
01:35:54,623 --> 01:35:56,416
- Where's Soph?
- She's back there.

1590
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,460
- Okay.
- Come on in.

1591
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:00,920
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. Hello.

1592
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,839
- Hi.
Hey, sport.

1593
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:04,799
- That was a wave to me.
- Okay.

1594
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:06,926
So, what else you maniacs been up to?

1595
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:09,179
Gary and I are taking
a couples' karate class.

1596
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:10,805
- Wow.
Fun.

1597
01:36:10,973 --> 01:36:13,349
I'm not going to be around to defend him
all the time.

1598
01:36:13,517 --> 01:36:15,018
- Toughen him up.
- Yeah.

1599
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:19,647
What a great opportunity to get to kick
your spouse in the face once in a while...

1600
01:36:19,815 --> 01:36:23,276
...in a controlled setting
where it's okay and it's expected.

1601
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:24,986
Messer.

1602
01:36:25,154 --> 01:36:28,448
- Hey. How you doing, doc?
- Good, good.

1603
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:31,034
- Glad you could make it.
- Appreciate that.

1604
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:35,622
Although, technically, this is my house,
so I'm glad you could make it.

1605
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:39,042
You know, I know this is a little weird.

1606
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:42,337
- No, it's not weird.
- It's a little weird.

1607
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,923
The house, we're all a part of it,
especially you.

1608
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,926
Yeah, we're all fans of the house.

1609
01:36:48,093 --> 01:36:51,095
Hey, dinner today is a great way
for us to say goodbye, right?

1610
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:52,680
Absolutely.

1611
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:57,310
I'm sorry, am I missing something?

1612
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:02,607
You're selling the house?

1613
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,611
- When were you going to tell me about this?
- After our meeting with CPS.

1614
01:37:06,779 --> 01:37:09,781
It's just too big, Messer.
The upkeep's a fortune. You know that.

1615
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:13,368
- I'm paying my half.
- I appreciate that, but it's still not enough.

1616
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,911
You should've asked me, Holly.

1617
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:17,539
Oh, like you asked me
about moving to Phoenix?

1618
01:37:17,706 --> 01:37:20,583
You're not selling the house.
They wanted her to grow up here.

1619
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:24,754
They wanted you and I to raise her,
but you walked away from that obligation.

1620
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:27,382
You sure didn't waste any time
finding somebody else.

1621
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,677
Are you going to try to make me feel bad
because you walked away?

1622
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:33,930
You wanted to do it on your own,
but you never could've without me.

1623
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:37,141
That's why seconds after I was gone,
you found Replacement Messer.

1624
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:38,726
He is not Replacement Messer.

1625
01:37:38,894 --> 01:37:41,771
Sound really travels in here,
don't you think?

1626
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:46,526
You know what? He is nothing like you.
Sam is nothing like you.

1627
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:50,697
He is warm and kind, and he doesn't
run away at the first sign of something real.

1628
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,115
Yeah, I ran.

1629
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:55,076
My best friend died,
and overnight I had a house and a baby.

1630
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:57,078
- I'm sorry if-
- If what?

1631
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:59,289
- I was scared.
- You don't think I was scared?

1632
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:03,001
It was easier for you. You wanted this.
You wanted the life that they had.

1633
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:06,170
But not the way I got it.
Jesus, not the way I got it.

1634
01:38:06,338 --> 01:38:08,631
And not with somebody
who didn't love me back.

1635
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:10,466
But I did.

1636
01:38:12,636 --> 01:38:14,345
Holly, I still do.

1637
01:38:19,476 --> 01:38:21,394
No, you're right.

1638
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:22,937
We were just...

1639
01:38:23,105 --> 01:38:26,274
We were just pretending to be them.

1640
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:29,611
We needed each other
to get through everything.

1641
01:38:29,778 --> 01:38:34,282
And now that's done, and we don't need
to pretend anymore, Messer, okay?

1642
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,534
I don't want to fight with you, please.

1643
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:44,709
I'm going to go back to Phoenix.

1644
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:47,295
You can handle Janine on your own.

1645
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:50,506
Looks like you got things covered here
without me.

1646
01:38:56,513 --> 01:38:58,097
Oh, damn it.

1647
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:04,687
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

1648
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:06,439
It was great to see you all.

1649
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,817
If you're ever in Phoenix,
don't be afraid to look me up.

1650
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:18,576
Shh, shh, shh.

1651
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:37,345
Okay, dinner is served.

1652
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:40,556
You guys all should try the stuffing.
Really, it's amazing.

1653
01:39:40,724 --> 01:39:44,352
There's an andouille-sausage thing
going on, so you'll love it.

1654
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,605
Go ahead and dig in.
Come on, everybody, just...

1655
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:50,191
Eat, now.

1656
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:02,412
All right, thanks for coming.
Good night, sweetie.

1657
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:12,088
Yeah, okay, that was bad.

1658
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,969
Yeah, maybe we did go too fast.

1659
01:40:18,137 --> 01:40:20,096
You have unresolved feelings for him.

1660
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:23,057
Messer and I barely got along
under the best circumstances...

1661
01:40:23,225 --> 01:40:25,727
...and there weren't very many
of those either.

1662
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:29,022
If my wife and I fought like that...

1663
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:33,151
...well, we'd still be married.

1664
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:43,119
You know, before anything happened
to Peter and Alison...

1665
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:46,664
...you were exactly the guy
I wanted to be with.

1666
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:51,377
I would lose time thinking about you,
and I didn't even know your name yet.

1667
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:59,343
I'll miss you guys.

1668
01:41:09,855 --> 01:41:13,983
"Leonardo was a terrible monster.

1669
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:18,279
He couldn't scare anyone.

1670
01:41:20,657 --> 01:41:23,034
He didn't have 1642-"

1671
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:24,994
Mama.

1672
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,790
No, Holly.

1673
01:41:28,957 --> 01:41:32,043
- No, I'm Holly.
- Mama.

1674
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:50,728
Yeah, baby girl.

1675
01:41:51,688 --> 01:41:53,397
I'm your mama.

1676
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,120
The truth is, you know,
sometimes it works better...

1677
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:09,580
...with one person doing everything,
you know?

1678
01:42:09,748 --> 01:42:12,458
No charts, no arguments.

1679
01:42:14,044 --> 01:42:15,545
I know it's not ideal.

1680
01:42:15,712 --> 01:42:18,714
But since when do parents
get the ideal, right?

1681
01:42:20,175 --> 01:42:24,929
Right? Right, pretty girl? Huh?
I know, I know.

1682
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:32,395
I'm sorry.

1683
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:34,814
I can't do this. This isn't right.

1684
01:42:35,482 --> 01:42:37,650
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, I'm an idiot.

1685
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:40,570
I got to reschedule.
I'm sorry. I need to get to the airport.

1686
01:42:40,737 --> 01:42:42,572
- Come on.
- What?

1687
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:03,176
All right, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1688
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:05,178
MESSER
Hey, this is Messer.

1689
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:07,263
- Ugh!
- Leave me something dirty.

1690
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:11,267
You know,
I could have come back for you.

1691
01:43:11,768 --> 01:43:15,062
Well, this is our last meeting,
and I'm booked up for the next month.

1692
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:18,441
- One way or another, we're finishing it.
- Okay.

1693
01:43:18,942 --> 01:43:22,486
If you want to get there quickly, you might
want to drive faster than other cars.

1694
01:43:22,654 --> 01:43:24,363
But you're observing me, so...

1695
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:27,992
- I'm observing you miss the flight. Move it.
- Okay.

1696
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,183
Come here.

1697
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:59,523
July 22nd, 2010. First steps.

1698
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:04,070
Where you going? Come back.

1699
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:07,490
Yay!

1700
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:14,789
You have a beautiful family.

1701
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:17,750
Thank you.

1702
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:20,294
Ladies and gentlemen...

1703
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:22,880
...Flight 722 to Phoenix
will now begin boarding.

1704
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:35,101
Hi. Hi. I need two tickets that will get me
anywhere near Terminal T...

1705
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:39,605
- ... as fast as possible, please.
- Three. I'm not waiting in the car.

1706
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:43,150
The baby's shoes too, ma'am.

1707
01:44:44,194 --> 01:44:46,529
Are you kidding me? They're baby shoes.

1708
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:50,616
- Just give her to me. Give her to me. Go.
- Here. Okay, thanks.

1709
01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:48,257
It's just, you ran all the way there...

1710
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:51,969
...and I thought when I took Sophie,
it would be, you know, okay.

1711
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:54,930
I know.
You know, you did great, you did.

1712
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:57,558
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine, I will.

1713
01:45:58,143 --> 01:46:00,061
- I've got Sophie.
- Yeah.

1714
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:02,980
And maybe this is the way
things were meant to be, so-

1715
01:46:03,148 --> 01:46:05,524
You're just going to be so unhappy.

1716
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:09,445
- I'm not going to start crying again.
- I should get Sophie inside.

1717
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:12,031
Yeah, sure.

1718
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:19,288
- You're going to be a great mom.
- Thanks.

1719
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:23,959
- I'll let CPS know you passed.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1720
01:46:24,669 --> 01:46:26,629
- Chin up.
- Okay.

1721
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:28,255
I'm really sorry that I cried.

1722
01:46:28,423 --> 01:46:30,758
- No problem. Used to crying.
- Okay.

1723
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:41,310
Okay.

1724
01:46:42,145 --> 01:46:43,479
Here.

1725
01:46:43,647 --> 01:46:47,608
Want to play with the keys?
Just don't lose them like last time.

1726
01:46:56,576 --> 01:47:01,122
- Oh, my God. Messer. Oh, my God.
- I didn't mean to scare you, all right?

1727
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:04,291
I had my key, and I thought
that you'd be home for Janine.

1728
01:47:05,335 --> 01:47:06,377
Messer-

1729
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:09,130
Look, please don't say anything.
Just listen.

1730
01:47:10,382 --> 01:47:12,842
I finally figured out
why Peter and Alison picked us.

1731
01:47:13,009 --> 01:47:14,844
And it's not because we knew them best.

1732
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:17,555
It's because you and me together,
with Sophie...

1733
01:47:17,722 --> 01:47:20,599
...somehow, we're a family.

1734
01:47:22,185 --> 01:47:24,687
Like they were.
And that's why they picked us.

1735
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:27,940
And when I'm gone,
I don't just miss her or you, I miss us.

1736
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:29,984
I miss our family.

1737
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:31,402
I know we got it backwards.

1738
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:35,030
You're supposed to meet, fall in love,
then have a baby, but I don't care.

1739
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:38,075
I don't care how it happened,
because I fell in love with you.

1740
01:47:38,535 --> 01:47:40,369
- I fell in love with our family.
- Messer.

1741
01:47:43,373 --> 01:47:45,291
I was at the airport.

1742
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:51,630
Did you plan some kind of a trip
that I'm not aware of?

1743
01:47:52,215 --> 01:47:53,591
No.

1744
01:47:56,386 --> 01:48:00,306
Well, did you hear me say I loved you?
Because I can say it again.

1745
01:48:00,474 --> 01:48:02,057
Okay.

1746
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:05,561
I love you.

1747
01:48:27,417 --> 01:48:31,629
When I found out that I was pregnant again,
I just cried and I cried and I cried.

1748
01:48:31,796 --> 01:48:34,215
And I said, "Scott, can we be this blessed?
Can we?"

1749
01:48:34,382 --> 01:48:36,509
We can't repeat what I said.
It was not polite.

1750
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:40,429
We cannot. We were- You know what?
I think Campbell needs a new diaper.

1751
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:41,847
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1752
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:43,057
- Me, huh?
- Yeah.

1753
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:45,392
- All right.
- Look at him go.

1754
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,063
Oh, Scott, could you get me maybe
a little glass of ice water or something?

1755
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:52,066
- Of course. Why haven't I done that?
Oh, I don't know.

1756
01:48:52,234 --> 01:48:54,026
Coming through.

1757
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:56,737
- Hey. Cookie?
- Uh-oh. I don't know what's more delicious.

1758
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:59,698
- Oh, no, thanks. Trying to cut back.
- Okay.

1759
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,535
Give me that back.
I'll take one of these. Mostly raisins.

1760
01:49:02,702 --> 01:49:04,787
- It's like a salad.
Yeah. It's a great salad.

1761
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:08,707
It's all about the sleep schedule, man.
You've got to put those babies to sleep.

1762
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:11,460
Hey, Sophie has a request for the caterer.

1763
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:13,003
- Cake.
- Yeah.

1764
01:49:13,171 --> 01:49:14,588
Cake? Do you like cake?

1765
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:18,551
It's simple, it's understated, it's...

1766
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:21,178
Yeah, you know me. That's how I roll.
Simple, understated.

1767
01:49:25,016 --> 01:49:27,560
- Ah. Okay, okay.
- Ah. Yes.

1768
01:49:27,727 --> 01:49:31,647
- You're never going to get any easier, are you?
- Nope. And I have another one.

1769
01:49:32,774 --> 01:49:35,693
What? She's 2.
- It's for us, because we made it a year.

1770
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:40,990
Okay, babe.

1771
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:42,491
- All right.
- Ready?

1772
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:45,703
- Here we go, Soph. Alrighty.
- Here we go.

1773
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:48,747
Here we go.
We're going to the birthday party.

1774
01:49:48,957 --> 01:49:52,001
Happy birthday to you

1775
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:55,754
Happy birthday to you

1776
01:49:56,339 --> 01:50:00,342
Happy birthday, dear Sophie

1777
01:50:00,802 --> 01:50:04,471
Happy birthday to you

1778
01:50:05,305 --> 01:50:11,260
