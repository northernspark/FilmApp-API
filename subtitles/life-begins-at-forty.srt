- Hey, Chris.
- Hmm? Huh?

3
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:00,772
<i>- Hear anything?
- No, sir. I didn't hear nothin', Mr. Clark.</i>

4
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:03,939
Don't hear nothin'?
You're deaf then.

5
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,778
Nothin's come around here
while I'm on the job.

6
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:09,581
You're lettin' him
sneak up on us here.

7
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:13,111
<i>Interferin' with the freedom of the press.</i>

8
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,385
- Give me that gun.
- I wasn't sleepin'.

9
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,121
I was just sort of playin' possum.

10
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:21,392
Gettin' so a man can't
get out his editorials around here...

11
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:23,592
without him stickin' his bill in.

12
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,431
Don't see him anywhere, do ya?

13
00:02:26,504 --> 00:02:29,302
<i>Huh?</i>

14
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:33,207
<i>- There he is!
- Is that him?</i>

15
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:37,043
I'm gonna miss him so close this time,
I'll bet ya he don't come back anymore.

16
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:42,150
There he goes. He's sure hightailin' it
away now. He won't be back.

17
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:47,255
<i>Kenesaw Clark, you leave that jaybird alone!</i>

18
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:51,090
Oh, uh-Well, hello!
Hello, Miss Ida. How are you?

19
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:53,959
You stop that shootin'
and scarin' people half out of their wits.

20
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:58,468
Oh, well, Miss Ida, that old jaybird's
makin' so much noise here...

21
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:01,562
<i>that, uh,
Chris just William Tell'd him.</i>

22
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,267
My land!

23
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:07,139
<i>Can't let a little jaybird
hardly open its mouth.</i>

24
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:10,942
Well, you know how it is,
Miss Ida, with us writin' folks.

25
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:13,142
We don't get
much compensation.

26
00:03:13,217 --> 00:03:17,586
About all we get is just the right
to act about half-cracked.

27
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,021
Half-cracked? Hmph!

28
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,685
<i>If I hadn't lived next door to you for 20 years,
I'd say you were all cracked.</i>

29
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,457
Now, you let
that jaybird alone!

30
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,124
Miss Ida's got her dander up.

31
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,497
She don't mean nothin' though.
Say, listen here...

32
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,594
you hustle out and see
if you can't collect some money...

33
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,764
for some subscriptions
around here.

34
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:38,808
People keep orderin' my paper.
Oughta be worth somethin'.

35
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,844
Oh, yes, sir.

36
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:58,194
Gonna get back
to first principles here.

37
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:03,292
You just keep on hollerin'
up there.

38
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,163
I'm just gonna-
David and Goliath now.

39
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,553
Thank you, kind sir.

40
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,690
Hey, how about
a little drive tonight?

41
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:39,167
You know schoolmarms aren't allowed out
except on Friday and Saturday nights.

42
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:43,900
- Oh, who'd find out?
- Nobody, because I'm not going.

43
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,903
Besides, I have some
examination papers to correct.

44
00:04:47,978 --> 00:04:51,004
I'm gonna tell the old man
to look for a new teacher.

45
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,345
No. No, you can't do that.

46
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,749
- Why not? You're gonna marry me, aren't you?
- Well-

47
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:00,115
Oh, excuse me. I, uh-

48
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,183
I'm just out here prowlin' around,
hidin' from Miss Ida.

49
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,252
I'm tryin' to get out of here.

50
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,355
- What's the matter? Jaybirds again?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:12,061
See ya tomorrow, Adele.
So long, old-timer.

52
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:16,630
‘‘Old-timer." Fresh thing.

53
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:20,370
Young folks ain't got any respect
for their elders anymore.

54
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:24,403
Don't include me in that.

55
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:27,041
Say, ain't there some kind
of law in this town...

56
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,608
where a schoolteacher's
not supposed to go out...

57
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:33,987
with every Tom, Dick and... Joe?

58
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:37,459
It's only in the dark
we aren't trusted.

59
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:40,554
I don't know
nothin' about it, but, uh-

60
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,292
I'm just warnin' ya.

61
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,663
Mr. Ken?

62
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,832
Hmm?

63
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:57,136
What's your honest opinion
of Joe Abercrombie?

64
00:05:57,214 --> 00:06:00,115
Well, he's got
awful pretty white teeth.

65
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:03,449
Be serious.

66
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,750
He's asked me to marry him.

67
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,814
You gonna do it?

68
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:12,521
Oh, Joe's all right,
but I don't know.

69
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:18,125
Well, you're gonna inherit
a lot of great kinfolks.

70
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:20,466
You don't think much
of his father, do you?

71
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,528
Oh, I don't know. l-

72
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:26,269
The old colonel's all right, I guess.
Kind of egotistical.

73
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:30,609
He may not exactly admit that he's
responsible for the rains we've been havin'...

74
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:36,642
but I think he'll tell you
that it was his original idea.

75
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,883
Still, you haven't answered
my question about Joe.

76
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:42,687
Now, listen,
I don't look any too bright...

77
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,493
but givin' advice to the lovelorn
ain't one of my weaknesses.

78
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:52,001
Joe's all right.

79
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:56,130
Besides, he might grow up
to be like his father.

80
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,301
Kenesaw, you come back here!

81
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:03,312
<i>Kenesaw Clark!</i>

82
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:20,160
The old boy's getting better all the time.
Listen to this.

83
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,860
‘‘This morning, I ate nine biscuits
and seven sausages for breakfast.

84

I couldn't have held another bite."

85
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,835
- Hello, Ken.
- Howdy, Ken.

86
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,380
Well, I hope I'm not
disturbing you boys.

87
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:41,747
Oh, no. Just looking over the stuff
you wrote for next week's column.

88
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,778
- Mmm. There's plenty of truth in this one too, Ken.
- What?

89
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:49,348
‘‘At 20, we don't care
what the world thinks of us.

90
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:52,259
‘‘At 30, we worry about
what it thinks of us.

91
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:55,127
At 40, we're sure
it doesn't think of us."

92
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,360
<i>That's hittin'the nail on the head.</i>

93
00:07:57,434 --> 00:08:01,564
You boys oughta be good critics. I hope
the payin' subscribers like it that well.

94
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:04,072
He means you!

95
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:08,273
Say, here's one.

96
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:11,872
Let's see if this hits
the nail on the head.

97
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,383
‘‘Loafing in a print shop...

100

- Uh-oh. I get it.
- Which way out?

101
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:25,756
<i>Don't mean us, do you, Ken?</i>

102
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:28,263
Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean you.

103
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:30,800
You boys don't loaf here.
You don't loaf here.

104
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:33,632
You live here.

105
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:51,350
You reckon you can do
any better with an ax?

106
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:53,651
You ain't gettin' along
so fast here.

107
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:56,215
You're goin' back.
You're gettin' old.

108
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,019
Blamed ol' termite.

109
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:03,498
<i>Come on. Get out. Come on.</i>

110
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:09,163
What's the matter here?
My Lord. Here, here.

111
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:12,834
How'd you ever go to enough effort
to get it in there anyhow?

112
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,971
You can gnaw away more wood
than a badger can.

113
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:19,038
<i>Come on.
With all that fur on your face...</i>

114
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:21,880
you're beginning to look
like a badger anyhow.

115
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,517
Yeah. Them concrete houses
are gonna give you-

<i>- Hello, Kenesaw.
- Well!</i>

117

since the cows come home.</i>

118
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:42,061
Well, I thought I'd bring in my subscription,
Kenesaw, while I was able.

119
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,573
You ain't thinkin'
about dyin' again, are you?

120
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:47,667
Well, none of us knows
when the call's comin'.

121
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,008
I'm hopin' to be prepared.
That's all.

122
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,481
Well, you come to the wrong fella
to talk about dying.

123
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,246
Take me now.
I'm just beginning to live.

124
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,188
It's all right enough for you to say,
but I'm pushin' 60.

125
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:04,819
Ah, 60! Why, you're just now ready
for your first mint of long pants.

126
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,329
Wait a minute. Here, don't sit down.

127
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:09,865
- What's the matter?
- Old T.'s been in here...

128
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:12,527
and he might've gnawed
a leg off of that chair.

129
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:15,070
Go ahead. It's all right.

130
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:18,539
This is-
This is no laughin' matter, Kenesaw.

131
00:10:18,608 --> 00:10:20,769
That's the reason
I came to you.

132
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:23,335
Let me sweep up here
a little bit.

133
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:27,372
<i>Can't tell whether you're in
a printin' shop or lumberyard.</i>

134
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:31,444
I'm thinkin' that you'd help me fix up
my last will and testament...

135
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:35,685
so as my children can't make fools
of themselves after I'm gone.

136
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,059
I suppose they've always done everything
that you wanted 'em to do.

137
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,758
No, they haven't.
That's the trouble.

138
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,858
Never could do anything with 'em.

139
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,460
Oh. You can't do anything
with 'em while you're livin'...

140
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:50,199
and you wanna control 'em
after you're dead.

141
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:54,209
- Is that it?
- Well, I know they're not gonna
waste my money when I'm gone.

142
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:57,735
Oh, yeah? Looks like
the government tax makers...

143
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:00,783
is gonna fix it so you ain't
gonna have to worry about that.

144
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:05,720
Oh, it's got so I can't sleep nights
just thinkin' about it.

145
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,751
<i>Hey, ain’t you the fella...</i>

146
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:12,386
that, when we was boys
in school together...

147
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:17,729
used to always be talkin' about you was
gonna get a lot of fun out of life?

148
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,996
Well, I've been too busy.

149
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,301
And once you get started,
it ain't so easy as you think.

150
00:11:23,373 --> 00:11:27,332
I'm not the only one.
There are thousands like me.

151
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:29,777
- Somebody's got to run the world.
- Ah!

152
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:32,110
‘‘Run the world" my granny.

153
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:35,447
You rich men is all alike. You spend
all your life makin' some money...

154
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,851
and then you get old and you
don't know what to do with it.

155
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:42,324
Hey, uh, maybe you're right, Kenesaw.

156
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:46,658
Ah, but even so,
it's too late now.

157
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,858
I-I'm too old a dog
to learn new tricks.

158
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:53,425
What could I do at my age?

159
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,494
Lots of things.

160
00:11:55,572 --> 00:11:58,166
You can get yourself
some fancy britches...

161
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,766
go out and court some widow
that's just itchin'...

162
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:05,645
to help some old man
spend his money.

163
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:11,119
Well, uh, do you think
that would be fair to my children?

164
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,316
- You started from scratch, didn't ya?
- Yes.

165
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:17,121
Well, then you wanna give them
just as good a chance as you had.

166
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,355
You don't wanna dump
all that money in their laps...

167
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,522
and spoil all their ambition.

168
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:24,226
Make lapdogs out of'em.

169
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:28,032
Well, uh,
you may be right, Kenesaw.

170
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,835
But I don't know.

171
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:35,469
Say, would it be all right...

172
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:38,480
about that widow business?

173
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:41,016
Who knows? Who cares?

174
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,211
I've heard that, uh...

175
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:45,777
you can have a lot of fun
with a widow.

176
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:51,591
Well, I'll be on my way.
So long, Kenesaw.

177
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:53,754
So long.

178
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,563
Hi, Colonel, old boy.

179
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:06,906
<i>Oh, hello. Hello, Colonel.
Come right on in.</i>

180
00:13:06,977 --> 00:13:09,002
<i>- Hello, Mr. Clark.
- How are ya?</i>

181
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,912
Say, I was just talkin'
about you not 10 minutes ago.

182
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:15,383
Well, I hope your estimate of myself...

183
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:17,682
was not too caustic, Mr. Editor.

184
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:20,018
Oh, no, no, no.
I was, uh...

185
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,390
just talkin' about that speech you made
up at the state bankers' convention.

186
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:26,861
- Uh-huh.
- Great stuff. You can't, uh-

187
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,694
You can't go wrong defendin'
the American Constitution.

188
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:32,860
<i>We've got to get back
to first principles, Mr. Clark.</i>

189
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:35,461
Well, that's great- great stuff.

190
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:38,099
Hop on the bandwagon
with the founding fathers.

191
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,372
Yeah.
I, uh-

192
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:44,607
I brought you over
a small item for the press.

193
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:47,377
I thought perhaps the community
might be interested-

194
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,544
In knowing that you
had offered yourself for reelection...

195
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,611
as head of our school board.

196
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:55,624
- Yes, that's right.
- Well, what about the annual outing?

197
00:13:55,692 --> 00:14:00,095
There's nothing that the voters
like better than a free meal.

198
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:03,132
Well, uh, I'm arranging that.

199
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,225
However, this time...

200
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,601
I'm goin' to encourage one
of our leading industries- hog raising.

201
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:11,163
In other words,
I propose a hog show...

202
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:14,233
to select the winner
for the county fair.

203
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,302
- Oh, hogs, huh? Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:18,973
Sure, I'll see that hogs
gets on the front page.

205
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,916
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. -

206
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:25,079
<i>- Yes, well, good day, Mr. Clark. Good day.
- Good day.</i>

207
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,491
- Here are the subscriptions.
- What's all this mess you got here?

208
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:37,192
Well, the lady said
you'd have to take these...

209
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,428
on account of they haven't
got any change in the house.

210
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:41,766
You can't take these down to the bank
and pay off that mortgage.

211
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,739
Hey! Catch 'em!
Don't let 'em get away!

212
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,304
Hey, where's the other one?
Where'd he go?

213
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,871
<i>- He was headin' over here.
- Chick, chick! Chick, chick, chick!</i>

214
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:55,941
<i>Chick, chick! Chickie!
Chick, chick! Chick, chick!</i>

215
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:34,849
Hello.

216
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:07,412
<i>Is that you, Lee Austin?
Come out of there.</i>

217
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:10,782
What are you fixin' to do,
get yourself in some more trouble?

218
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:13,549
- You oughta know what I'm gonna do.
- Well, here.

219
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,613
- Forget it, whatever it was.
- But l-

220
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:18,888
Now, listen. You come on home with me
and get somethin' to eat.

221
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:21,020
<i>Let's talk this thing over.
Come on.</i>

222
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,425
Son, if you wanna make
good batter cakes...

223
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:29,960
you got to have
your batter just right.

224
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,304
You must always stir
from left to right.

225
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:38,472
That's what makes it just as light
as a feather on a baby goose.

226
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:43,246
Now, if you stir from right to left,
that's where those heavy babies come from.

227
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,023
Then you-
Then you toss 'em just so.

228
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:55,928
Not too much. Just-Just flip, easy-like,
and meet 'em comin' down.

229
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:59,832
Don't ever meet 'em goin' up.
That's what spoils their disposition, see?

230
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:02,132
Now, that's what you call technique.

231
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:06,868
Yes, sir. There's mighty few men
and no women at all can do that.

232
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:13,542
Here. Now, get yourself
some butter on those...

233
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,447
and, uh, then just smother 'em...

234
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:19,852
till they practically drown
in that good molasses.

235
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:24,291
And the deliciousness
will just ooze out of'em.

236
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,193
And from then on,
they'll do their own advertisin'.

237
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,857
Drink coffee?

238
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:32,298
You don't understand
about tonight.

239
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:34,529
I didn't ask you
any questions at all.

240
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:37,629
I was gonna make him
tell the truth, or kill him.

241
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:41,198
A couple of first-class funerals
would do this town a lot of good...

242
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:44,337
but shootin' people's
not the way to initiate it.

243
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,745
You know what he did to me.

244
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,581
Well, I wouldn't be
too hard on the colonel.

245
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,214
No. It did look kind of suspicious.

246
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,748
You was workin' in the bank,
and all that money disappeared.

247
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:02,354
<i>- And you can't say you didn’t get a fair trial.
- But I tell ya, I wasn't guilty!</i>

248
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,992
Then you got nothin'
to worry about, son.

249
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:08,502
That's a laugh.

250
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:12,905
I've been in jail. I'm branded as a convict.
My whole life is ruined.

251
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:16,706
Your life is ruined.

252
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,044
<i>What do you know about Life?
You haven't started to Live yet.</i>

253
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:23,710
Every minute I was in there,
I thought of only one thing-

254
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:26,687
to get him and that lying son of his.

255
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:32,024
You didn't deny bein'
in the bank that night.

256
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:34,619
I tell you, I was framed!

257
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,722
All right, now, come on.
Quiet down.

258
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,257
<i>Sit down and eat your cakes there
before they get cold. Come on.</i>

259
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:48,432
Why didn't they question Joe?
He worked in the bank same as I did.

260
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,378
Why don't you stick around here
and see how people act?

261
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:55,417
You know, there ain't nothin'
that'll upset a guilty conscience...

262
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,475
like an innocent man's presence.

263
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,418
I've got a fine chance proving it.

264
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:03,982
Oh, who knows? Maybe
some new evidence will pop up.

265
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,994
But what could I do?
Who'd give me a job?

266
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:12,591
Ain't a finer business in the world
than the printin' business.

267
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:15,364
Kind of lonesome here.
Got lots of room.

268
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,002
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

269
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,304
<i>Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!
Come on in.</i>

270
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:26,644
We had some strawberry shortcake for supper,
and Miss Ida thought you might like-

271
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:30,116
Oh, uh, I hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

272
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:32,847
Nobody but yourself.
Here. Meet-

273
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,685
This is, uh-This is my helper,
Lee Austin.

274
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,522
- You remember him.
- Oh, yes.

275
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,030
That is, uh,
I've heard of him.

276
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,531
- Hello.
- Hello.

277
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,195
Don't be afraid of her, Lee. She's, uh-
She's just a schoolteacher.

278
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,762
Just come here from out of town
about the time that you left.

279
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,831
Her name's Del Anderson.

280
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:58,846
Folks say that she's not so popular
with these town girls.

281
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:01,542
Say, did you ever- Did you ever eat
one of my batter cakes?

282
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,642
- Why, yes, of course.
- Well, you're gonna eat one now.

283
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,710
Wait a minute. Sit right here
where there's clean plates.

284
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:10,054
<i>Come on. Hustle around here
and help fix up-Wait on her there now.</i>

285
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,286
I've got to run over
to Miss Ida's.

286
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,522
They tell me she's been
feedin' that jaybird just to spite me.

287
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,962
<i>- Well, I can't stay but a minute.
- I'll be right back.</i>

288
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,203
Let me get you some coffee.

289
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,742
I'm really not very hungry.

290
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:34,212
Well, it's risky business.

291
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:37,980
You know how the folks
in this town talk.

292
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:43,355
Ida, you and I are old enough,
we don't have to care what they say.

293
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:47,589
Speak for yourself, Kenesaw Clark.

294
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:52,100
I never did like the way them Abercrombies
stirred up sentiment.

295
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:58,569
Lee- I knew his folks...
before they died.

296
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,508
Awful fine people. Never was a finer man
ever lived than Lee's father.

297
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,842
Mmm.

298
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:06,972
I know, but after three years,
you'd a-think...

299
00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:10,576
something would have turned up
if he was innocent.

300
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:14,179
After they sent him to jail, why,
folks figured the case was settled.

301
00:21:14,256 --> 00:21:18,056
Well, I don't see any good
in reopening it now.

302
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:20,118
Well, maybe not.

303
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,254
Ain't no harm, though,
in nosin' around...

304
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,697
seein' what we can find out.

305
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,930
Besides, that's what
a newspaperman's for-

306
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:30,062
to get out the truth
every once in a while.

307
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:37,238
I, uh- I think with you, me...

308
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,577
and Del behind him,
he's gonna be all right.

309
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:43,709
Now, see here.
Don't go so fast about Del.

310
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:47,654
It's all right about us,
but that girl was entrusted to my care...

311
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,918
and I'm morally responsible for her.

312
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:53,018
And I'm not a-gonna
bring her into this.

313
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:04,029
Looks like, uh, the case
has been taken out of your hands.

314
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:08,166
Well!

315
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:13,579
I had to tell you.
I'm not a very desirable neighbor.

316
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:18,677
Mr. Ken offered you a job,
didn't he?

317
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,450
Yes, but he's different.

318
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:24,151
And he asked you
to live here?

319
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:27,320
Well, even I couldn't hurt
a reputation like his.

320
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,956
Oh. So you think
my reputation is so shaky...

321
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:32,330
that being friends with you
would ruin it.

322
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:37,338
- Oh, I didn't mean that.
- Well, then, don't intimate it.

323
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:39,431
Do you have to stand up?

324
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:12,273
<i>Come on! Sing.</i>

325
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,044
Falsetto, Off-key]

326
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,715
Say, you know, you don't get that part
right right in there.

327
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:07,956
These kids don't-
They sing it too low anyhow.

328
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,726
I didn't even take the pipe
out of my mouth to sing that time.

329
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,427
Well, I knew you had somethin'
in your mouth. Was that was that was?

330
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:16,596
Is that so? Well, you-
Listen here. You started it. Let's see.

331
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:19,368
Well, all right.

332
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,932
- That's what I'm talkin' about. Get it higher.
- Higher?

333
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,746
Of course, you've got it
pretty high there...

334
00:24:34,823 --> 00:24:36,814
but you ain't gonna
lick me at that.

335
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:48,228
Don't tell me about singing.

336
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:51,397
- My land!
- I should be on that wagon.

337
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:53,498
Get a crack at that song
out there.

338
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,844
Here, you're just in time.
Open this for me.

339
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,510
Mmm.

340
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,645
- Where's your can opener?
- Over there.

341
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:13,186
You know,
the American eagle...

342
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,424
ought not to be
our national emblem.

343
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:18,489
Oughta be a can opener.

344
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,502
<i>- Where is it?
- On the wall.</i>

345
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:28,170
<i>- I don't see it.
- Here, right In front of you.</i>

346
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:31,406
Oh, this thing here?

347
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:39,145
Well, what in the world-
How do you-

348
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:42,816
The man that invented this thing
was public enemy number one.

349
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:45,985
I can think of no quicker way
of starvin' this country to death...

350
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:49,963
than to invent a can opener
that nobody knows how to work.

351
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:52,023
You know anything
about the thing?

352
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,864
Why, of course.
Here, give it to me.

353
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:57,962
You men.
You can't do anything.

354
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,508
There.

355
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:09,345
Well, what do you know
about that now?

356
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:12,046
<i>Crazy thing did work at that.</i>

357
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,680
<i>Thought you were gonna walk home
from church with Miss Ida.</i>

358
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:18,556
Well, she went
to the missionary meetin'...

359
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:20,857
to help feed the heathens.

360
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:25,332
Americans'll feed everybody
that don't live close to 'em.

361
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,769
Here, make yourself useful.
Put some of these things in that basket.

362
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:34,172
- Where's Lee?
- Oh, Lee's been primpin' since daylight.

363
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:37,302
I think he's puttin'
some hair oil on too.

364
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,078
Hey, that's a pretty dress
you got on there. Hmm?

365
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:45,619
Kind of fancy to be wearin'
to a picnic, ain't it?

366
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,712
- You like it?
- Mm-hmm.

367
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:50,019
An awfully nice horse
gave it to me.

368
00:26:50,092 --> 00:26:52,083
What do you mean, a horse?

369
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,788
You won't tell?

370
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,297
Well, the other day,
Joe Abercrombie persuaded me...

371
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,232
to bet three dollars
on a horse race in Louisville.

372
00:27:00,302 --> 00:27:03,430
- And the horse won.
- Yeah?

373
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:05,769
Is Joe, uh, a bettin' man?

374
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:10,073
- Joe bets almost every day.
- Oh, is that so?

375
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:13,774
Why, he almost won $30,000
about three years ago.

376
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,477
$30,000?

377
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,076
Mm-hmm. But he said
the race was crooked.

378
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:22,715
He lost instead.

379
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:24,816
I hurried just as fast as I could.

380
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:29,921
But that preacher got off on old folks'
problems, and you know how he is.

381
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:31,989
Good land. To hear him talk...

382
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,663
you'd think us people of 40
are ready for the boneyard.

383
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,799
Miss Ida, you don't look a day
older than you did 20 years ago.

384
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,811
A little-You've broadened.

385
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,904
Here, use this on him, Miss Ida.

386
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:47,972
Oh, it doesn't bother me any.

387
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:51,746
I wouldn't starve myself
to death for anybody.

388
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,186
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh?

389
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,816
Miss Ida says anybody
that eats has to work for it.

390
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:59,690
Squeeze some orange juice
and put it in a thermos bottle.

391
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,026
Mmm, that looks good.
I'm practically starved.

392
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,124
- Nothin' like a good appetite.
- You always could eat.

393
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:10,262
My old daddy worked
hisself into the grave...

394
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:13,034
before he was 50 just tryin'
to make enough to feed us kids on.

395
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,599
Well, I can well believe that.

396
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:17,804
You don't catch me
workin' that hard.

397
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:21,508
I've got an electric stove
and a washin' machine and a mixer and-

398
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:24,381
Why, everything in here
runs by electricity.

399
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,615
All I have to do is just press a button,
and my work's done.

400
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:31,056
Yeah. With everything
workin' by machinery...

401
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,618
the American born a hundred years from now
won't have any head or arms or legs.

402
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:37,995
You'll just have a thumb
just to push a button with.

403
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,035
- What? No arms?
- No arms?

404
00:28:41,102 --> 00:28:44,629
- Maybe I'm wrong.
- Give me the good old romantic days.

405
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:48,142
- Me too.
- You children are livin' in
the greatest age in history...

406
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,144
and you haven't got
sense enough to see it.

407
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:54,672
Well, one advantage I'll admit. Years ago,
women weren't supposed to have minds.

408
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:58,082
What do you mean, years ago?

409
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:03,250
Why, the machine age has given
us women leisure and time to think.

410
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,885
Yeah? Well, what do you think?

411
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:08,156
Oh! Well,
I think it's about time...

412
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,255
we were gettin' to this picnic
if we're ever going.

413
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,324
Nothing in the world makes me so hungry
as sittin' in church for three hours.

414
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:16,029
Here, Lee.
Take this thing out to the car.

415
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:19,631
You all monkeyed around here so long,
I've lost my appetite.

416
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:35,320
Wait a minute! Hey, hold it!

417
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,959
- Mr. Ken, I know it's none of my business, but-
- What?

418
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,090
These people paying you
with chickens and rabbits-

419
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,100
That's pretty poor pay for writing.

420
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:49,136
Pretty poor writin' too.

421
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,570
No, it's not.
And I've got an idea...

422
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,491
you can make more money
with this paper.

423
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:59,256
I should entertain
a proposition like that.

424
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,197
Mr. Ken, let me tackle
these advertisers, will ya?

425
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,235
Sure. I'll tell ya,
I'll make you general manager.

426
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,570
Give you any other title you want.

427
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:14,509
All right then. The first thing I'm gonna do
is get rid of these loafers.

428
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:18,275
- I'll begin with T. Watterson Meriwhether.
- Hey, hey. Old T?

429
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,341
<i>Can't get along without old T.</i>

430
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,547
He's one of the best antiques
we've got in this town.

431
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:36,599
You know, he solved a problem
that all the world...

432
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,034
outside of China, is searchin' for.

433
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,868
<i>- What's that?
- How to relax.</i>

434
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,170
He certainly has.

435
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:51,347
Why, it just quiets my nerves
just to look at him.

436
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:56,042
He's not relaxed.
He's asleep.

437
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:04,258
Well, he-
He does 'em both alike anyhow.

438
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,064
<i>Hey, hey. Come on.
Wake up. It's gettin' late.</i>

439
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,160
<i>Come on here!
Wake up! Wake up!</i>

440
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:15,296
<i>Get on home here.
Come on. Gonna close up.</i>

441
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:17,363
Go on home
and do your relaxin'.

442
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:20,137
It's gettin' dark.
Must've dropped off for a minute.

443
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,146
Yeah, you certainly did.
You've been asleep here for a long time.

444
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,205
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

445
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:28,149
Hey, wait a minute. You better take
this flashlight with you here...

446
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,210
so you can see your way home.

447
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:32,687
Thanks, Kenesaw.
I'll return this to you tomorrow...

448
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,816
if I don't get tied up.

449
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,625
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good-

450
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:50,030
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.

451
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:52,098
Pleasant dreams, Colonel.

452
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:01,543
Why don't you turn on your lights?
What's the matter with ya?

453
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,679
- That's disgusting.
- Drunk again.

454
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:06,814
He oughta be locked up.

455
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,192
Well, good day, gentlemen.
What can I do for you?

456
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,791
<i>Clark, I want a word
with you in private.</i>

457
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:22,237
Private? Anything
you wanna say to me...

458
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:25,798
you can say it before this-
my partner here.

459
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:29,972
- I'll step outside a minute.
- No, you won't. You'll stay right here. What is it?

460
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:33,881
We think, that in taking this young man
into your employ, that you've gone too far.

461
00:32:33,951 --> 00:32:35,885
What's your objections?

462
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,944
- He's a thief and a convict.
- That's right.

463
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:41,583
- Why, you-
- Now, here, here. Now, wait a minute now, Lee.

464
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:45,060
Let me- Let me take care of this thing.
Now, you was sayin'?

465
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,290
I was sayin'
I won't put up with it-

466
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:49,389
your flaunting him
in the face of the decent...

467
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,457
law-abiding citizens
of this community.

468
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:54,231
He stole once. There's no proof
he won't do it again...

469
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,331
if he's coddled and protected
by people like you.

470
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:01,242
Now, suppose you run your bank,
and I'll run my paper.

471
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,746
Your paper.

472
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,241
Listen here, young man.
If I was you...

473
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,446
I'd stay out of this
just as long as I could.

474
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,615
Now, you, Colonel.

475
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:18,754
Now, we're just supposin'.
Now, supposin' it was your boy Joe here...

476
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:20,820
that was, uh,
tryin' to come back?

477
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,664
My son would never find himself
in such a position.

478
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:28,000
Well, maybe not.
Maybe not.

479
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,802
But we're just supposin',
you know?

480
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,106
In the bank, there's a lot of money.
It's a big temptation.

481
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:38,114
You old windbag! Are you trying to insinuate that
I had anything to do with stealing that money?

482
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,310
You heard me say
that I was just supposin'.

483
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:45,321
Now, that's about all, Clark.
Either he goes, or you go!

484
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:47,380
- You mean that?
- Yes!

485
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,790
I lent you a lot of money
to put in this new machinery...

486
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,988
this Linotype here,
and I've been mighty easy with ya...

487
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:55,964
letting it run on
month after month.

488
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:59,196
Well, you know good and well
that as soon as I'm able-

489
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:05,140
Unless you get rid of this man,
I shall have to demand immediate payment.

490
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,905
Well, looks to me, Colonel...

491
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:10,572
like you're
in the newspaper business.

492
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,912
- You can't do that, Mr. Kenesaw.
- Now, now.

493
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:15,645
When we're licked,
we'll just as well admit it.

494
00:34:17,621 --> 00:34:21,557
Well, when do you-When do you
figure on takin' the place over?

495
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,650
My son Joe
will take over immediately.

496
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:26,252
Oh, Joe, huh?

497
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,096
Anytime you have
any news for the paper, let me know.

498
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,692
News for the paper, huh?

499
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,170
Get your hat, son.

500
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:48,876
Mr. Kenesaw, there's no sense
in your doing a thing like this.

501
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,944
Forget about it.
Forget about it.

502
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:54,354
What this town always needed anyhow
is a good opposition paper.

503
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:58,521
- I think I know a fella who's gonna start one.
- Who?

504
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:01,393
I've got an old Washington hand press
up in my attic...

505
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,899
that I started with 34 years ago.

506
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,959
You mean
that maybe you'll be the one-

507
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:09,199
<i>You know what I'd call the paper?
I'm gonna call it the Wildcat.</i>

508
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,437
<i>That's it, the Wildcat. And I'm gonna
lay on his doorstep and howl...</i>

509
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,740
and then claw him
when he comes out.

510
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,441
<i>That's the name it's gonna be-
the Wildcat.</i>

511
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:51,975
Traditional]

512
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:58,153
Kelly Cotton telephoned that her cousin
Ellie Crabtree Thursday'd in our midst.

513
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:01,623
Ah, ‘‘in our midst."
That's old-time newspaper stuff.

514
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,092
‘‘In our midst"
don't get you anywhere.

515
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:08,325
You've got to tell what scandal they
got into while they was in our midst.

516
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,833
If you was a good newspaper woman...

517
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:16,862
you'd hustle around here and find out
who's gonna have a blessed event in our midst.

518
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,843
Uh-huh? Well, I'm not prowling around
in other people's private affairs.

519
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:26,508
Don't have to. You're a woman, ain't ya?
Just keep your eyes open.

520
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:34,985
Well, maybe you'll think
this is news.

521
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,687
Tom Cotton's elopin'
with that widow.

522
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:41,197
What do you know about that?

523
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,234
I wonder who put that idea
in that old fool's head?

524
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:47,737
Go ahead, now, and give 'em all
the adjectives you got there...

525
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:51,241
because he's gonna deserve 'em
when he starts in on that high livin'.

526
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:54,835
Mr. Ken, did you write
this copy in the dark?

527
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,312
I never saw so many
misspelled words in my life.

528
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,350
Yeah? Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

529
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,977
When I first started
in the newspaper business...

530
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,511
I misspelled a word, everybody
said it was just pure ignorance.

531
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,356
But when you misspell all of'em,
they accuse you of being a humorist...

532
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:12,691
say you're quaint.

533
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,993
- I got some paper.
- Great!

534
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:17,056
Got it from the butcher.

535
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,695
He said it was so hot,
nobody's eating meat now anyway.

536
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,604
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I done just like you said.

537
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,370
I waited till he had his mouth shut,
and I went click.

538
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:28,536
Good. That's great.
Say, listen...

539
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:31,581
will you run up to the county seat with that
and see if you can get a cut made?

540
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,912
We're gonna show 'em some
real newspaperin' around here.

541
00:37:33,984 --> 00:37:36,612
- Sure.
- I could drive him up.

542
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,882
That is, if Miss Ida'd
let us have her car.

543
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:42,448
- Oh, now, that car's not used to long trips.
- It's only 18 miles.

544
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,086
<i>Oh, don't argue about it.
Come on. Come on. Let's get goin'.</i>

545
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:49,462
- Get goin'. Hurry up now. Hurry up.
- Now, see here, Kenesaw.

546
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,592
- What do you mean by sendin' that-
- Aw, boo.

547
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:54,535
Well!

548
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:04,078
Oh, say, by the way, you might
phone over to Mr. Abercrombie...

549
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:07,311
and tell him you have
the following social note for him.

550
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:10,911
‘‘Lee and Del Wednesday'd
in the county seat."

551
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,947
- You're just achin' to stir up
some trouble, aren't ya?

552
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:17,823
No, not achin',
but it would be a pleasure.

553
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:22,962
I guess you know I think it's pretty swell
of you folks taking me in like this.

554
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,558
- Oh, stop it, Lee.
- How can I?

555
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,161
Just because Mr. Ken's
been nice to me...

556
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:31,401
they take his paper
away from him.

557
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,638
I wonder why the Abercrombies
are so bitter?

558
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:37,236
That's what I'd like to know.

559
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:41,916
Well, it's mighty funny to me.

560
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:45,580
I suppose Joe'll be worse than ever now
on account of you.

561
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:50,184
- On account of me?
- Well, he's in love with you, isn't he?

562
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,822
Well, he's asked me to marry him
if that's any proof of love.

563
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:57,162
Are you going to?

564
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,259
Well, I don't know.

565
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:02,533
Let's see, Monday- No.
I'm really gonna be awfully busy next-

566
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:05,302
I'd rather see you dead first.

567
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:10,540
Why, Lee! That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

568
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,459
Kenesaw Clark is behind this!

569
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,663
You mean Lee Austin.
He probably put Clark up to it.

570
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:36,865
That Meriwhether!
That moron! That loafer!

571
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,306
That ignoramus!
Head of the schools!

572
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:42,402
All three of'em
oughta be run out of town.

573
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:46,006
Well, I'll be reelected
if I spend every penny I've got!

574
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,176
Joe, get busy.
Get word out in the paper...

575
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,710
that every living soul in this district
is invited to my hog party.

576
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:55,554
l- Never mind. I'll write the copy myself.
Here, give me some paper.

577
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,686
You got any paper here?
Well! That one there.

578
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:01,822
Uh- Have you got a pen?

579
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:05,129
I'll show them
who they're dealing with.

580
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:11,663
<i>Take that!</i>

581
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,594
Stop it!
Wait a minute, Ma!

582
00:40:18,662 --> 00:40:20,892
So that's the way you make
a fool of yourself away from home!

583
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:22,693
There must be some mistake.

584
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:25,394
<i>Callin' Colonel Abercrombie a jackass,
and him head of the bank.</i>

585
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:27,733
Why, I never called nobody
a jackass.

586
00:40:27,804 --> 00:40:31,570
<i>I guess I can read, can't I? It's right there
on the front page with your picture.</i>

587
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:34,940
Didn't even have sense enough
to keep your eyes open.

588
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:38,708
- What am I gonna do?
- Do? You're a man, ain't ya?

589
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:43,811
You go up there and whup that Kenesaw Clark
within an inch of his life.

590
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:46,947
Then go around and tell Colonel Abercrombie
the truth. That's what you'll do.

591
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:49,150
Aw, but- Don't you think that-

592
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:51,217
- Are you gonna go?
- I'll go! I'll go!

593
00:40:51,294 --> 00:40:53,057
Well, git then!

594
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,657
Well, T., looks like you woke the town up
to some real excitement.

595
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:59,201
<i>- You can count on me!
- Congratulations, T!</i>

596
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:01,362
A lot of folks in this town
feel the same as you do...

597
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:03,497
but they haven't got
nerve enough to say so.

598
00:41:03,573 --> 00:41:06,508
- You'll get my vote.
- You hand it to 'im, T.

599
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:13,547
- I hope you win.
- I always knew it ain't right for
a man to hold a job too long.

600
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:16,950
I wanna shake your hand.

601
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,751
- You son of a gun, you!
- You're all right!

602
00:41:20,824 --> 00:41:22,621
<i>Mr. Clark! Mr. Clark!</i>

603
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:24,683
<i>- What Is It? What's the matter?
- He's coming.</i>

604
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:26,956
- Who's coming? What?
- Old Meriwhether's coming.

605
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,123
- What about it?
- He's got a horse whip.

606
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,635
- Oh, I knew it, I knew it!
- Maybe you could cut out through here.

607
00:41:32,702 --> 00:41:35,136
- A horse whip?
- You better let me handle him, Mr. Ken.

608
00:41:35,205 --> 00:41:38,572
My Lord. In the old days, they used
to come looking for me with a gun around here.

609
00:41:38,642 --> 00:41:42,476
What's the matter? Is this town getting soft?

610
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:45,481
He is comin' at that.

611
00:41:56,893 --> 00:41:59,054
<i>- Mr. Clark.
- Mr. T.</i>

612
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:02,098
I think you used poor judgment
in your choice of photograph.

613
00:42:02,165 --> 00:42:05,566
However, I think the colonel's
in for a scrap.

614
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:09,765
Well, of all things, he believes it himself.

615
00:42:11,942 --> 00:42:15,378
I think you're-
I think you're right about that, Major.

616
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:19,404
Yes. Major. The first thing we gotta do
is offset this show of the colonel's.

617
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:23,010
Sink his navy like we did at Manila
and then pursue him into the hills.

618
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:26,180
- What would you suggest?
- Well-

619
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:33,361
Now, we gotta have somethin'
with some zip.

620
00:42:35,532 --> 00:42:37,864
Now, if it was a dance-

621
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:42,130
- Or may-
- If you don't mind.

622
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:44,935
Or an all-day singing-

623
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:47,943
Of course, if I was down home,
I'd say a hog-calling contest.

624
00:42:48,011 --> 00:42:50,036
- Hog calling?
- Yes.

625
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:52,104
Used to be the champion
in the county.

626
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:56,050
Listen to this.

627
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:58,713
Pig, pig, pig, pig, pig,
pig, pig, pig!

628
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:01,655
That's all. No.
He's all right. Thanks.

629
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:04,091
- All right.
- Nobody but-

630
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,390
Hog callin', huh?

631
00:43:06,463 --> 00:43:09,830
Say, do you, uh-
Do you think that you could, uh...

632
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,562
round up some of your kinfolks
with a call like that?

633
00:43:12,636 --> 00:43:16,732
My folks are a clannish people.
They'll come when I call 'em.

634
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:19,570
Sir, it looks like I picked
the right candidate again.

635
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:22,976
Put her there. Pig!

636
00:43:23,046 --> 00:43:26,948
- Pig, pig, pig!
- Say, you're good too.

637
00:43:29,486 --> 00:43:31,784
Pig, pig, pig!

638
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:04,045
That's as fine a lot of potential hams
as I've ever seen.

639
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:10,153
- How do you do, Colonel?
- How do you do? How do you do?

640
00:44:10,226 --> 00:44:12,319
- Your little girl?
- Yeah, my daughter.

641
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:15,387
Well, well, well.

642
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,097
- Here, my dear. There's a penny for you.
- What do you say?

643
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,400
- Thank you.
- We'll see this one here.

644
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:26,203
I think I'm capable of choosing
my own friends, Joe.

645
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:28,836
If I happen to like Lee Austin,
that's my business.

646
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:31,005
You know what he's done.

647
00:44:31,081 --> 00:44:33,174
You're just getting yourself
talked about, and I don't like it.

648
00:44:33,249 --> 00:44:35,740
How does it affect you?

649
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:38,185
Well, we're practically engaged,
aren't we?

650
00:44:38,254 --> 00:44:42,088
- Are we?
- Besides, you're getting yourself
in bad with my father.

651
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:46,822
Oh, I suppose he thinks I might be
corrupting the morals of the pupils.

652
00:44:46,896 --> 00:44:49,558
Anytime your father wants to get
a new teacher, it's all right with me.

653
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:51,601
- Now, listen-
- I've heard enough.

654
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:53,693
What are we doin'
way over here?

655
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,897
Why don't we go down there
where the pigs are?

656
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:59,772
- We'll go down there in a minute.
- Here comes T.

657
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:03,711
<i>Come on!</i>

658
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,683
Well, my land!
Will you look at that?

659
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:16,117
We're all here, I guess.
This is Pappy comin' here.

660
00:45:16,192 --> 00:45:19,355
<i>- He's in charge.
- Hello, Mr. Clark. How are you?</i>

661
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:21,454
<i>Come on up, folks,
and meet Mr. Clark.</i>

662
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,895
I was talkin' to T. here
about the contest...

663
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:28,130
and I told him we'd better
get set on the technique.

664
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:30,968
- Technique?
- That's what it takes.

665
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:33,373
You take a little pig,
you gotta call 'im high.

666
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:37,038
Uh, Effie,
show 'em what I mean.

667
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:40,082
Pig!

668
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:47,082
Pig, pig, pig!

669
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:53,224
Now, an old sow, though, she won't answer
to nothin' but a call halfway in between.

670
00:45:53,296 --> 00:45:57,392
Hank, show your stuff.

671
00:45:57,467 --> 00:46:01,597
Pig!

672
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:05,163
Pig, pig!

673
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:08,108
But when it comes to a boar,
that's when you gotta hit it.

674
00:46:08,178 --> 00:46:10,408
- Luke, you got it?
- Yes, sir.

675
00:46:11,548 --> 00:46:13,641
Pig!

676
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:20,580
Pig, pig, pig!

677
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,218
There you are,
Now, which you wanna use?

678
00:46:25,295 --> 00:46:28,628
Well, uh, if the other two
ain't too busy...

679
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:31,929
we might use all three of'em.

680
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:36,802
The final judging!

681
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:39,967
Before we come
to the final judging...

682
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:44,036
I've been asked to remind you of a political
problem which has developed in our midst...

683
00:46:44,114 --> 00:46:46,674
and to which I unfortunately
am a party.

684
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,844
<i>Pig, pig, pig!</i>

685
00:46:52,422 --> 00:46:57,485
Pig, pig, pig!

686
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,324
Pigs will be pigs.

687
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:07,164
As I was saying,
you may not realize it...

688
00:47:07,237 --> 00:47:11,196
but you and your children
have been subjected to an insult...

689
00:47:11,274 --> 00:47:14,641
never before offered
to a moral and a spiritual people.

690
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:16,804
<i>l-</i>

691
00:47:19,616 --> 00:47:22,676
Pig, pig, pig, pig!

692
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:26,051
My friends, I am referring to...

693
00:47:26,122 --> 00:47:28,886
the character and person
of the candidate...

694
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:31,051
who is opposing me
in this campaign.

695
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:40,827
If you think this is funny, I don't!
This is no joke!

696
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:42,895
<i>Go see who's making those noises!
Clear out!</i>

697
00:47:45,408 --> 00:47:49,037
<i>My friends, I stand before you...</i>

698
00:47:49,112 --> 00:47:51,945
as this interloper's
‘‘impregnable" foe...

699
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:54,006
as your challenge to backwardness.

700
00:48:09,499 --> 00:48:11,467
I call upon you-

701
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:58,575
I got myself
a piece of pork here.

702
00:48:58,648 --> 00:49:01,310
- Why didn't you get a big one?
You never do anything right.
- Hang on!

703
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:12,425
This is Kenesaw Clark's work.

704
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:16,022
I'll shoot him on sight,
like a dog!

705
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:18,829
I'll get him for this
if it's the last thing I do!

706
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:25,841
Only blood can wash away
the wrong he's done me.

707
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:28,935
I hear Kenesaw's making
the same kind of threats against you.

708
00:49:29,012 --> 00:49:31,105
I shall be prepared for him.

709
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,640
- That means you're gonna shoot him on sight?
- Such is my intention.

710
00:49:35,718 --> 00:49:38,016
<i>- What do you want?
- Nothing much, son.</i>

711
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:42,046
<i>I'd just like to look through some of
your old back issues of the Citizen.</i>

712
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:45,561
Well, you know where they are.

713
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:47,789
Won't take me but a minute.

714
00:49:47,864 --> 00:49:50,332
I'm lookin' for a little
social item was in the paper...

715
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,664
along about the time
that Lee took that money.

716
00:49:52,735 --> 00:49:54,930
Then he admits taking it?

717
00:49:56,773 --> 00:49:58,798
Well, he don't exactly admit it...

718
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:02,709
but I haven't heard him
denying it lately.

719
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:05,213
You know,
if I remember right...

720
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:07,545
your testimony
was mighty damagin' to him.

721
00:50:07,617 --> 00:50:11,644
- He's the only one that could've done it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

722
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:15,748
I guess that's right.
Yep, money's awful temptin' to young folks.

723
00:50:20,263 --> 00:50:23,323
<i>Hey, what do you think
you're doing?</i>

724
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:26,698
Get up! Look out there!

725
00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:30,330
- Oh, let go!
- Wait a minute, please.

726
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:32,465
Got the thing here-

727
00:50:34,777 --> 00:50:37,837
Meddling- Get outta here! Go on!

728
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:44,177
What's the date that money
was found missin'?

729
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:47,347
March 5, 1932.

730
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:51,621
<i>- Huh?
- March 5, 1932.</i>

731
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:56,424
Wish I had a memory like that.

732
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:17,478
- Much obliged, Joe.
- Find what you wanted?

733
00:51:17,553 --> 00:51:20,818
I wouldn't be surprised.

734
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:24,326
- Hey, wake up.
- Pig, pig, pig, pig, pig!

735
00:51:24,394 --> 00:51:27,056
<i>‘‘Pig, pig."
Come on. Wake up. Get outta here.</i>

736
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:30,461
Go on. Typical candidate.

737
00:51:30,633 --> 00:51:33,625
Well, Ken, has the colonel
fired on you yet?

738
00:51:33,703 --> 00:51:35,796
That old blowhard wouldn't
fire on nobody.

739
00:51:35,872 --> 00:51:38,272
You're not afraid of him,
are you, Ken?

740
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:43,176
Listen here. When my honor's involved,
I lose all sense of fear or reason.

741
00:51:43,246 --> 00:51:46,272
- Well, the colonel says he's gonna get ya.
- Yeah?

742
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:49,648
- The only way he'd get anybody
is with a mortgage.

743
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:53,120
Well, you better look out.
There's plenty bad blood in that colonel.

744
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:56,488
- And when I spill some of it,
he won't be so bad either.
- Uh-huh.

745
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,154
Better come with me, T.

746
00:52:00,229 --> 00:52:02,629
- Just leave him to us.
- Uh-huh.

747
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,561
Well, you can always
depend on me.

748
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:16,175
Look-

749
00:52:19,749 --> 00:52:22,240
Go on.
Drive around the block.

750
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:48,034
Much obliged.

751
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:22,798
- Are you all right, Ken?
- Did he hit ya?

752
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:26,395
- Nowhere that I can see.
- We sure made him take to cover.

753
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:28,598
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

754
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:31,039
- Yeah? Where?
- Around the corner a mile a minute.

755
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:34,374
<i>It's a good thing for him.
Come on, T. We'd better get home.</i>

756
00:53:37,115 --> 00:53:41,074
<i>What'd you mean by sayin' before them men
that we made him take off?</i>

757
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:44,122
Well, we was together, and l-

758
00:53:47,459 --> 00:53:50,326
<i>Colonel, I call on you for a truce...</i>

759
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:53,330
to discuss ways and means
of fightin' this thing out.

760
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:56,162
Well, you won't shoot
if I consent?

761
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:59,328
I got nothin' to shoot with
but an old pipe here.

762
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:02,305
Oh. Well, I'm unarmed myself.

763
00:54:02,374 --> 00:54:06,242
Well, then, looks like
we can trust each other.

764
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,676
Look here, Colonel. We can't go on
like this, meetin' on every corner.

765
00:54:13,752 --> 00:54:17,313
It's gettin' so I can't turn a corner
here in town without runnin' onto you.

766
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:21,348
<i>I propose that we settle this
Like gentlemen settle anything- with a duel.</i>

767
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,621
- As the challenged party-
- Wait a minute.

768
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:27,131
You're the one challenged me.
I'm the one to name the weapons.

769
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,667
- As you wish, sir.
- All right. I'll name pistols.

770
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:32,259
And we'll meet in the old grove
at daylight.

771
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:35,636
- At your service, sir.
- At your service.

772
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:39,734
- Good day, Mr. Kenesaw Clark.
- Good day, Colonel Abercrombie.

773
00:54:41,246 --> 00:54:44,443
Now, you're my second.

774
00:54:44,516 --> 00:54:47,383
If anything happens
and I shouldn't be able to show up-

775
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:50,819
<i>- Good day, Mr. Clark.
- Wait a minute here. Come here.</i>

776
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:53,289
I'm gonna meet that old bird,
and I'm gonna fight him.

777
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:56,555
And when I get through,
you're gonna be runnin' on both tickets.

778
00:54:56,628 --> 00:54:58,653
Well, I guess we can handle it.

779
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:03,901
<i>- You sent for me, Mr. Clark?
- Yeah.</i>

780
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:07,132
Say, are you still triflin'
with the affections...

781
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:11,335
of that girl over there
at Colonel Abercrombie's?

782
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,468
I'm not trifling.

783
00:55:13,545 --> 00:55:18,573
- Is she trifling with you?
- Yes- Uh, no, s-

784
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,811
- I don't think so.
- Mm-hmm.

785
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:24,583
- You're both serious, huh?
- Why, ye-

786
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:26,681
No. No-Yes, sir.

787
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:29,352
Do you think you could get her
to do somethin' for ya?

788
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:32,453
Oh, sure.
My Olga'll do anything for me.

789
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,392
Practically.

790
00:55:36,468 --> 00:55:39,562
Here. Here's what I want you
to get her to do.

791
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:54,383
Now these old bullets
won't kill anybody.

792
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:57,444
<i>- You through yet?
- Almost.</i>

793
00:55:57,522 --> 00:56:01,014
Look, Olga. When he shoots 'em now,
all they'll do is just go-

794
00:56:03,295 --> 00:56:05,388
But hurry. He may come back.

795
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,522
Okay, okay.

796
00:56:14,005 --> 00:56:17,031
Olg, are you triflin' with me?

797
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:24,705
- Oh, Chris!
- It's a good thing.

798
00:56:24,783 --> 00:56:27,547
<i>Oh.</i>

799
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:15,661
- Howdy, Ken. We're all ready.
- Let's go, Doc.

800
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:18,828
<i>Hurry up there, T.
Come on.</i>

801
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:25,868
Let's see that gun here.
I wanna be sure that all those are blanks.

802
00:57:25,944 --> 00:57:28,208
I'll bet the colonel's scared speechless
right this minute.

803
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:31,612
I think that's him coming now.

804
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:36,817
- Are you all set, T?
- I'm set.

805
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:39,152
Now, listen here.
Keep your eyes open now.

806
00:57:39,224 --> 00:57:42,125
And the minute I shoot,
you get busy with these tomatoes.

807
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:45,162
Don't worry. I'll be ready.

808
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,461
- You know what you're supposed to do?
- Yes, sir. There's the can.

809
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:50,728
- Run over there, and be quiet.
- Here's your gun.

810
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:54,005
Stand back.

811
00:58:04,783 --> 00:58:08,082
Nice shootin', Ken.

812
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:10,314
Oh, well, hello, Colonel.

813
00:58:10,388 --> 00:58:13,585
I didn't know you was here.
I was just doin' a little practicin'.

814
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:15,683
W-W-Whenever you're ready, sir.

815
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,354
I'm ready now.
Is Joe acting for you?

816
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,866
- He is, sir.
- Well, Lee here is acting for me.

817
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:25,664
<i>Charlie is the referee, and the doctor here
will give you any aid possible.</i>

818
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:27,728
Well, he won't be needed for me.

819
00:58:27,806 --> 00:58:30,240
- I wouldn't take that coat off if I was you.
- Why?

820
00:58:30,308 --> 00:58:33,539
'Cause it's awful hard to get it
back onto a man when he's layin' down.

821
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:35,772
We'll see.

822
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:42,549
Are you ready, gentlemen?

823
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,679
- I'm ready.
- I'm re-

824
00:58:52,831 --> 00:58:54,958
- I'm ready.
- Six paces, I believe.

825
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,230
- Yeah.
- Remember, six paces- turn and fire.

826
00:58:58,303 --> 00:59:01,431
Ready? Go!

827
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:41,403
You both missed, gentlemen. Ready again, please.

828
00:59:41,479 --> 00:59:44,243
<i>- Alm.
- W-W-Wait a minute.</i>

829
00:59:44,315 --> 00:59:46,408
Wait just a minute.
Just a minute here.

830
00:59:46,484 --> 00:59:50,477
This thing ain't workin' out
just exactly like I figured it would.

831
00:59:50,555 --> 00:59:53,649
Somethin' radically wrong here.
Now, here, I wanna talk to you about this.

832
00:59:53,725 --> 00:59:56,489
You didn't take
the right number of paces.

833
00:59:56,561 --> 00:59:58,927
- You mean to insinuate that I'm cheating?
- I'm not insinuating!

834
00:59:58,997 --> 01:00:02,023
I'm simply telling you to stay awake!
And watch what you're doing!

835
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,126
<i>- Don't you yell at me!
- I'll yell at you! I want you to stay awake!</i>

836
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:07,194
I am awake! I am awake!

837
01:00:07,272 --> 01:00:09,638
Pig!

838
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,372
- Stay awake and watch what you're doin'!
- Yeah! Yeah!

839
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:19,243
Ready? Go!

840
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:00,519
Kenesaw, y-you got me.

841
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:04,323
Well, I didn't mean to.
I was shootin' at your leg.

842
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:08,331
- I forgive you.
- That's mighty fine of you, Colonel.

843
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:13,567
Gentlemen, remember me like this.

844
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:16,334
Honor- Honor above self.

845
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:18,500
Stop it! They're making a fool of you!

846
01:01:18,576 --> 01:01:22,842
Oh, Son, don't laugh
at your poor, dying father.

847
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:25,508
Doctor, I'll bet ya this is the first case...

848
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:27,710
you've lost in the neighborhood
by tomatoes.

849
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:31,846
Huh? Tomatoes?

850
01:01:31,923 --> 01:01:35,450
Joe, this is gonna be a great story
for both our papers.

851
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:38,188
Why, you-

852
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:41,858
‘‘Colonel Abercrombie Shot
by Ripe Tomato"! Extra!

853
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:45,266
<i>Here you are! Read all about It!
Colonel Abercromble shot with tomato!</i>

854
01:01:45,336 --> 01:01:47,702
- Read all about it here! Extra!
- Huh? Why, you-

855
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:50,297
What? Hey, come back here with those papers!

856
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:53,105
<i>- Come back here!
Come back here with those papers!</i>

857
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,080
Wait a minute here.

858
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:03,287
Did it hurt ya? Huh?
What happened anyhow?

859
01:02:03,354 --> 01:02:07,051
I guess I must've been cuttin'
on the wrong limb.

860
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:10,288
Give me that knife.

861
01:02:36,988 --> 01:02:40,515
<i>- Boy, that's a pip.
- How do you like this one?</i>

862
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:43,583
- You dirty rat!
- Hey!

863
01:02:54,405 --> 01:02:57,169
- Hey, Lee, quit that!
- Aw, cut it out!

864
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:59,937
Here, here, here, here.
What's this all about?

865
01:03:00,011 --> 01:03:02,343
I don't know. He just came in here
and piled into me.

866
01:03:02,413 --> 01:03:06,110
And if you ever print another thing
like that about Miss Anderson, I'll be back!

867
01:03:06,184 --> 01:03:08,277
You will, eh?
You'll come with me.

868
01:03:08,353 --> 01:03:10,548
<i>You've caused enough trouble
In this town.</i>

869
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:12,851
I'll put you where
you can cool off.

870
01:03:12,924 --> 01:03:15,324
- We'd better phone Kenesaw.
- Ken's outta town.

871
01:03:15,393 --> 01:03:18,089
- He is?
- Left day before yesterday. I'll phone Ida.

872
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:27,830
<i>- Hey, there.
- Oh, hello, Del.</i>

873
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:30,396
You certainly picked
a fine time to be out of town.

874
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:34,411
Yeah. A fellow down at the depot
told me all about Lee acting up.

875
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:37,141
We had a terrible time.
If it hadn't been for Miss Ida...

876
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,048
- he might've had to stay in jail all night.
- It'd have done him good.

877
01:03:40,118 --> 01:03:42,916
- Maybe it'd have cooled him off.
- It was all my fault.

878
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:45,751
As if anything Joe Abercrombie said
could matter.

879
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:50,219
- You kinda like Lee, don't ya?
- Yes.

880
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:53,855
But he's the stubbornest,
most contrary person I ever met.

881
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:56,559
What are you gonna do about it?

882
01:03:56,634 --> 01:03:59,068
That's what I wanna
talk to you about.

883
01:03:59,137 --> 01:04:02,937
I thought he was going to be all right,
but now, after being in jail again...

884
01:04:03,007 --> 01:04:05,339
he's more stubborn than ever.

885
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,401
It's too bad.

886
01:04:07,478 --> 01:04:10,106
I'm no matchmaker.

887
01:04:10,181 --> 01:04:12,274
But just suppose
you were a matchmaker.

888
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:15,114
I'm no man to do any supposin'.

889
01:04:15,186 --> 01:04:17,518
What are you,
arrivin' at that stage...

890
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:22,525
where you, uh, think that
washin' dishes is romantic?

891
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:26,495
Well, I lie awake nights
thinking about darning his socks.

892
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:31,101
Well, I ain't got any advice
to the lovelorn...

893
01:04:31,169 --> 01:04:34,866
but I've noticed that no man
ever popped the question...

894
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:37,737
unless the lady
led her ace first.

895
01:04:37,809 --> 01:04:41,301
Well, I've done everything
but threaten him with a shotgun.

896
01:04:41,379 --> 01:04:44,212
Sometimes you have
to shoot 'em first.

897
01:04:44,282 --> 01:04:47,774
<i>Hey. Hey. Hey. Duck behind that.</i>

898
01:04:47,852 --> 01:04:50,320
Maybe we can find out
what his intentions are.

899
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:55,254
Hello.

900
01:04:55,326 --> 01:04:58,784
Young man, looks to me...

901
01:04:58,863 --> 01:05:02,799
like I can't go to the woodpile and back
without you gettin' all messed up.

902
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:07,566
I wasn't gonna let Joe Abercrombie
or anybody else talk about Del.

903
01:05:07,638 --> 01:05:12,507
Don't you know there's ways
of winnin' a battle without fightin'?

904
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:16,013
I'm sorry.
He had it comin' to him.

905
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,447
Well, I feel mighty bad
about the fight...

906
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:23,119
and me not seein' it.

907
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:25,417
It seems like everything I do
turns out wrong.

908
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:28,152
- I just saw Del.
- Yeah?

909
01:05:28,226 --> 01:05:32,925
Yeah. She's, uh, kinda talkin'
about gettin' married.

910
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:36,956
- Married?
- Mm-hmm.

911
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:41,596
Funny thing, I always, uh, kinda figured
you two would hit it off.

912
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:46,132
Oh, how could I ask her to marry me?
Wouldn't be fair.

913
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:49,304
What's fairness got to do
with marryin'?

914
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,577
Aw, I wish I'd never
come back to this town.

915
01:05:54,852 --> 01:05:57,650
Would you feel any different
if I was to tell you...

916
01:05:57,722 --> 01:06:00,953
<i>that within 24 hours,
your name would be cleared?</i>

917
01:06:01,025 --> 01:06:03,994
What? Well, how do you know?

918
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:06,120
- Tell me. But-
- Now, don't get all excited now.

919
01:06:06,197 --> 01:06:09,655
- Just leave it to me, and it's fixed.
- I've gotta tell Del.

920
01:06:09,734 --> 01:06:12,328
Hey, hey, what are you gonna tell her?
You gonna-

921
01:06:12,403 --> 01:06:14,394
You gonna ask her to marry you?

922
01:06:14,472 --> 01:06:16,736
Well, do you think
she'd have me?

923
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,900
Yes!

924
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:30,144
- Del!
- Well, now that you've asked me, when'll it be?

925
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:33,884
Why- l-

926
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:37,223
<i>- Mr. Ken?
- Yeah?</i>

927
01:06:37,295 --> 01:06:39,388
Will you give us a party
so we can announce it?

928
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:42,398
Lee might change his mind.
How about tomorrow night?

929
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:44,491
<i>Have to ask Miss Ida about that.</i>

930
01:06:44,569 --> 01:06:47,003
Then it's all settled.

931
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:49,062
<i>Come on.</i>

932
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:52,208
I wish you'd stay out of here.

933
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:54,210
You told me to drop in
when I had some news.

934
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:57,076
Now I've got some news
that's fit to print.

935
01:06:57,148 --> 01:07:00,174
I just arrived back in town
after a trip.

936
01:07:00,251 --> 01:07:03,414
What do you want me to do about it,
put it in the society column?

937
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:06,854
Be a good idea at that.
Kenesaw Clark-

938
01:07:06,924 --> 01:07:09,449
or Mr. Kenesaw Clark-

939
01:07:09,527 --> 01:07:12,462
Wednesday'd and Thursday'd...

940
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:15,931
in Louisville, Kentucky.

941
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,901
Louisville?

942
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:21,097
Say, I don't want this
to get out.

943
01:07:21,172 --> 01:07:25,131
Just between you and I, I sneaked over
to do some horse racin'...

944
01:07:25,209 --> 01:07:27,234
at Churchill Downs.

945
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:29,513
- It's a pretty track, ain't it?
- Yeah.

946
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,580
I guess so.

947
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:36,642
Met an old friend of yours
while I was over there.

948
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,314
<i>- Sends regards to ya.
- I don't know anyone in Louisville.</i>

949
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,692
Sure, you know this fella.

950
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,196
- He's your bettin' commissioner.
- I never bet on the races.

951
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:53,628
He told me that you and Wally Stevens,
about three years ago...

952
01:07:53,704 --> 01:07:58,801
come down there and tried
to make a cleanup... on a sure thing.

953
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:01,504
He's a liar.

954
01:08:04,014 --> 01:08:06,107
That's funny.

955
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:08,708
About the time that, uh...

956
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:12,812
$3,000 disappeared from the bank...

957
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:14,824
this horse run last.

958
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:21,823
- What are you driving at?
- Me? Oh, nothing.

959
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:25,460
How did it come that there
was a society item in the paper...

960
01:08:25,536 --> 01:08:28,994
saying that you was in Chicago
about this time?

961
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:33,008
How could you be in Chicago when you
and Wally Stevens was in Louisville?

962
01:08:33,076 --> 01:08:35,476
- That's not so!
- Not so you's in Chicago?

963
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:37,605
No, Louisville.

964
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:44,487
The way I've got it, uh,
printed up here in my paper...

965
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:47,422
I wouldn't be surprised...

966
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:51,961
if a lot of people believe it.

967
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:02,028
Of course, Joe, uh...

968
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:06,508
if you could figure out some way
to, uh, clear Lee's name...

969
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:10,206
<i>as a kind of a weddln'present
for him and Del...</i>

970
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:15,308
why, I may be able to kill
the rest of that edition.

971
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:20,623
Now, I've only got till midnight.
That's my deadline.

972
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:28,189
<i>Dance]</i>

973
01:09:45,616 --> 01:09:47,709
- Hello, Del.
- Where's your boyfriend?

974
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:50,275
He went downtown.
He'll be back in a few minutes.

975
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:52,549
Forgot the cigarettes.

976
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:54,818
- How many?
- Two cartons.

977
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,386
- Wrap 'em for you?
- No, that'll be all right.

978
01:09:59,463 --> 01:10:02,955
- Quite some doings at your house, huh?
- Yeah.

979
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:04,967
<i>- Congratulations.
- Thanks.</i>

980
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,764
Jailbird.

981
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:13,841
Look at that.
Look what that old boy landed.

982
01:10:16,013 --> 01:10:18,811
<i>A man never gets too old
for a blonde, does he?</i>

983
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,009
I wonder if she got a sister.

984
01:10:22,486 --> 01:10:25,114
<i>Well, well, If it ain’t Kid Cotton!</i>

985
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:27,179
- Sir.
- How are you?

986
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:31,853
<i>I just know you're Mr. Clark.
And I'm so glad to meet you.</i>

987
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:35,830
- We owe everything to you, don't we, Daddy?
- Yes.

988
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:39,232
- I'll show you where to put your coat.
- Thank you.

989
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:48,039
Hey, Tom. Say, you-
You far exceeded my expectations.

990
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:55,480
Well, looks like I'm in for one of
the liveliest years of my life, Kenesaw...

991
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:57,782
if I hold out.

992
01:10:57,854 --> 01:11:01,517
Now, now.
Don't get discouraged, Daddy.

993
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:05,083
Don't- Don't do that.

994
01:11:05,162 --> 01:11:08,495
- Hello, honey.
- Oh, Mr. Ken. I'm so happy!

995
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:10,556
- Hey.
- What?

996
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:12,864
<i>- Did you ask her If she had a sister?
- Oh!</i>

997
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:42,160
What's happened?
He's not breathing.

998
01:11:42,232 --> 01:11:45,565
Hey, it's Joe Abercrombie! Come on.
Give me a hand. Get him in the drugstore.

999
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,967
You're never gonna get around it.
Give him some air.

1000
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:55,035
<i>- Careful, boys. Careful.
- Easy. Easy.</i>

1001
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:58,113
- Say, phone for a doctor, will ya?
- Right.

1002
01:11:58,181 --> 01:12:01,048
- He's been shot!
- Shot?

1003
01:12:01,118 --> 01:12:03,586
I'll bet Lee Austin did it.

1004
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,712
- He said he'd get Joe.
- Somebody call the colonel.

1005
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:07,848
- I'll go.
- Who's with me to get Austin?

1006
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:14,891
<i>I don't care if they are busy!
Cut in on 'em!</i>

1007
01:12:14,965 --> 01:12:18,867
- Give me the sheriff's office!
- Hurry, Colonel. Joe's just been shot!

1008
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:21,563
What?

1009
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:23,697
Joe?

1010
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,539
<i>- Where is he?
- In the drugstore.</i>

1011
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:48,122
Hello, Pap! Hiya!

1012
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:50,257
<i>- Hello, Mr. Clark.
- Hi, Pappy.</i>

1013
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,961
Just wanted to drop T. off
and say good-bye to ya.

1014
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:55,504
<i>- Couldn't have dropped him
anywhere else, could you?</i>

1015
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:57,904
Well, you better change your mind
and come and join us.

1016
01:12:57,974 --> 01:13:00,943
No. Much obliged. Gotta make the foot
of the mountain by daylight.

1017
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:04,276
Well, you know you're always
welcome here anyhow, you know.

1018
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:06,338
Pig!

1019
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,756
- Good-bye!
- Bye!

1020
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:21,923
Good-bye! Good luck!

1021
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:24,796
<i>- Hurry up with that stuff!
- We better give Parker the treatment too.</i>

1022
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:26,859
Don't worry.
We'll take care of him.

1023
01:13:26,937 --> 01:13:28,962
All right! Come on now!
What are we waitin' for?

1024
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:32,406
For some tar and feathers!

1025

<i>- All promenade!

01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:11,298
<i>- What do you fellas want?
- We want Lee Austin!</i>

1033
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,899
<i>- What do you want him for?
- He shot Joe Abercrombie! That's what for!</i>

1034
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:16,070
He didn't shoot anybody.
Now you guys get outta here.

1035
01:15:16,146 --> 01:15:18,546
- We're saying he did, and we're taking him.
- No, you're not taking him.

1036
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:20,776
There he is!

1037
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,943
Get him, boys! Get him!

1038
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:35,654
Pappy!

1039
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:38,895
Something's happened.

1040
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:41,233
T.'s hollerin' for help.
Get goin'!

1041
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:45,670
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Hold on!

1042
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:47,972
<i>Cut it out and listen a minute,
will ya? Hold on!</i>

1043
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:50,308
You fellas are all wet.
How could he have done that?

1044
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,439
- He's been at this party all night.
- That's a lie.

1045
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:55,678
- I saw him downtown just before Joe was shot.
- I only went to get cigarettes.

1046
01:15:55,752 --> 01:15:58,152
- There! You see?
- That don't say he done it anyhow.

1047
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:01,782
Now get outta here! Come on!

1048
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:31,586
Ow!

1049
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:10,324
Down! Down!

1050
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:24,835
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

1051
01:17:24,908 --> 01:17:28,344
All you, stop it!
Stop! Will you stop?

1052
01:17:28,411 --> 01:17:30,345
I tell you Lee didn't do it!

1053
01:17:30,413 --> 01:17:33,541
Will you stop? Stop!
Stop it, I tell ya!

1054
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:36,585
Stop it!
Lee didn't do it! Stop it!

1055
01:17:42,058 --> 01:17:46,017
I'm sorry, Kenesaw.

1056
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:48,894
Here. Get your gang and get outta here,
and don't you come back in here!

1057
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,974
Kenesaw, Joe's told me everything.

1058
01:18:10,787 --> 01:18:14,245
And I want all you people to know
that Lee didn't have anything to do...

1059
01:18:14,324 --> 01:18:16,918
with stealing that money
from the bank.

1060
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:19,826
And we're going to make
full restitution.

1061
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:28,794
Lee, I only hope you can
find it in your heart to forgive us.

1062
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:33,066
That's all right, Colonel.

1063
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:38,770
And if you'll only come back
to your old job in the bank...

1064
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:40,941
I'll be very grateful.

1065
01:18:41,017 --> 01:18:43,076
Thanks.

1066
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:48,913
That's mighty fine of you, Colonel.

1067
01:18:48,992 --> 01:18:53,656
Kenesaw, your-
Your old paper's waiting for ya.

1068
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:57,928
Thanks. Just a minute.
There's just one thing here.

1069
01:18:58,001 --> 01:19:02,131
T. here figures that that school job
would keep him pretty busy.

1070
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:05,504
He's wonderin' if you couldn't make him, uh,
lightnin' rod inspector.

1071
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:08,942
We-We haven't got
any lightning rods.

1072
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:11,105
- You haven't got any?
- No.

1073
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:14,673
Well, he'd make you an awful good man then.

1074
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:17,151
They're made out of iron.

1075
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,518
Yeah.

1076
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:23,218
- Yeah. I'll look at it.
- All right. Fine.

1077
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:30,696
