00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,192
In accordance with the regulations
of the state of Mississippi,

3
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,070
we gather today
to lay to rest

4
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:38,284
the remains of inmates
R. Gibson, number 4316,

5
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,086
and C. Banks,
number 4317.

6
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,170
<i>Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.</i>

7
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,340
May God have
mercy on their souls.

8
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,089
Amen.

9
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,259
You can go
ahead, fellas.

10
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,523
Look like you
finally free now, boys.

11
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,152
Finally free.

12
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,817
Friends of yours, old-timer?

13
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,204
Well, let's just say
we spent some time together.

14
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,368
Now, why do I
get the feeling

15
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,166
when you say "some time,"
you mean "some time"?

16
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,124
I'd been here a good
while when they come.

17
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,544
They come here,
must've been 1932.

18
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,715
Ah, man!

19
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,259
Shit, that's like...
Wait a minute.

20
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,257
That's 65 years, son.

21
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,592
Shit.

22
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,132
Didn't they burn up
in that fire yesterday?

23
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,967
Listen, man,
I seen them niggers

24
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,393
before they
put them in the box.

25
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,142
And when I tell you, them
niggers, they was bacon burnt,

26
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,808
shit, it was like some shit
from the X Files, man.

27
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,687
What you got in that bottle
anyway there, old-timer?

28
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,946
This is
Rayford's special recipe.

29
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,243
See, he had
what we call

30
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,162
"exacting standards"
when it come to the hooch.

31
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,994
So, what were they,
bootleggers?

32
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,700
Something like that.

33
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,629
Hank, my man,
how you doing?

34
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,180
Oh, no.
Not tonight, Ray.

35
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,723
Spanky's not
happy with you.

36
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,175
Is Span Ky here?

37
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,976
Do yourself a favor
and find another place

38
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,428
where they let you
in the front door.

39
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,229
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

40
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,683
What about that time I bought your
girl them alligator shoes, man?

41
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,021
What's the problem? Did
I come through for you?

42
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,101
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,357
Bitch was wearing
pigskin when I met her.

44
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,733
I got her out of the swine.
She's wearing alligator.

45
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,859
Let me in.
Help a nigger out.

46
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,066
There you go. That's how it goes, brother.
That's how it goes.

47
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,402
Thank you, man. I appreciate it.
Appreciate it, man.

48
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,528
How does this tie look? Looking sharp.
Looking sharp.

49
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,330
Yeah, I feel lucky
tonight, too.

50
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,371
Yeah!

51
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,380
Here's to your new job
down at the bank.

52
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,131
Thank you.

53
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,559
I always knew you'd make
something of yourself.

54
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,392
You know what I'm gonna buy
with my first paycheck?

55
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,514
What, baby?

56
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,318
Season tickets to the Yankees, right
there, on the first base line.

57
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,229
What's wrong, baby?

58
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,031
I was hoping you were gonna say
an engagement ring, Claude.

59
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,862
Engagement ring?

60
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,070
That's what
respectable folks do.

61
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,489
Get a job, get married,
start having babies.

62
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,116
That's what you want,
isn't it?

63
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,744
Baby, I just don't
see no reason

64
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,295
to rush into things,
that's all.

65
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,174
Look, I got to clean this. I'll
be right back, baby. All right?

66
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,189
Good evening, sir.

67
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,518
Hello. Can I have
a towel, please?

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,648
Of course.
Oh. Look at this.

69
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:57,028
Hey, now, there ain't no reason to get violent.
Look, I tried to call.

70
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,950
Sit your ass down.

71
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,952
Congratulations, Claude.

72
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,701
We understand you finally
got yourself a job.

73
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,498
Yeah. Now you can pay Mr. Riley

74
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,996
that 50 bucks
you owe him.

75
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,248
Look, fellas, I got
a bill to pay out there.

76
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,046
Lookie here, $22.

77
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,921
Not bad for a start.
Not bad.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,879
That's two weeks' pay, man.
I'm here with my girl.

79
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,087
You gotta
leave me something.

80
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,638
How about your legs?

81
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,433
My legs?
Oh, those are good.

82
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,182
Oh, yeah.
Hey, yeah, that's good.

83
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,480
I'll keep the legs,
you know.

84
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,400
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

85
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,399
How'd he get in here?
Evening.

86
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,695
Evening.

87
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,737
Always messing with me.

88
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,085
Um, you got any of
that French shit?

89
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,250
Yeah, bro. Here.

90
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,128
Yeah, that's the one.
That's the one there.

91
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,423
Yeah. Thanks, man.

92
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,671
All right.

93
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,504
I smell French?
Yeah, that's it.

94
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,634
Yeah. Here, you keep the change.

95
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,714
Thank you.

96
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,969
Yeah.

97
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,067
Hey, don't I know you?

98
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,811
I don't think so.

99
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,737
Yes, I do. I know you.
What is your name?

100
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,153
Claude Banks.
Claude Banks!

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,614
Claude Banks, hey,
it's me, Ray Gibson.

102
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,071
We went to high school together.
How you doing, man?

103
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,868
You went to Monroe?

104
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,495
Monroe.
Yes, definitely.

105
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,621
How you doing, man?

106
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,917
Look at you,
looking all sharp.

107
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,246
Make me feel good to see colored
folks doing good for themselves.

108
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,956
Yeah, well,
I went to Jefferson,

109
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,633
so you must have a different
Claude Banks in mind.

110
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,755
Excuse me.

111
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,632
I'm sorry, man.
My mistake.

112
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,220
Yeah.

113
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,057
Hey, you wearing
that dress!

114
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,521
Whoo!

115
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,727
Hey, Isaac,
what's going on, man?

116
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,609
This is about my tab, huh? Don't
worry about it, I got it covered.

117
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,441
Man, it's hot in here tonight.
Hot.

118
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,364
This ain't
about your tab, Ray.

119
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,990
You got bigger
problems than that.

120
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,743
Hold up one second.
I had...

121
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,790
You should've never ran numbers
on Spanky's side of Broadway.

122
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,912
Let's go.

123
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,744
But I really think we
gotta get out of here.

124
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,420
Excuse me,
sir, your bill.

125
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,250
The bill? Oh, yeah,
yeah, of course, the bill.

126
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,804
How can I forget the bill?
Such an incredibly large bill.

127
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,177
Just tell me where
you want me to go.

128
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,103
Get over here.
Get over there.

129
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,646
You done
took my ankle.

130
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,192
All right,
that's not nice.

131
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,519
Yeah, right.

132
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,525
What do you think
they're gonna do to us?

133
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,982
I don't know. What'd you
do, dine and ditch?

134
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,864
Over 10 bucks?
Yeah.

135
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,240
Probably just looking at
a thumb or something.

136
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,662
Who is he, Ray?

137
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,785
Friend of yours?

138
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,083
I never met this man
before tonight.

139
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,378
Okay? He's a lowlife that
hangs around in bathrooms

140
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,579
pickpocketing people.

141
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,541
Me? I'm a professional man.

142
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,297
Now, I got a job
that starts on Monday.

143
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,467
I'll pay you back with my first
paycheck, with interest.

144
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,931
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your business here,

145
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,510
but if you cut off my fingers,
you won't get nothing.

146
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,973
Working on adding machines, I
got to be whole. Ching-ching.

147
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,479
You know, you can understand that.
I need these for praying.

148
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,900
Drop him.

149
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,444
Wait, what does
"drop him" mean?

150
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,154
Time for a little dip.
What do you mean, "Drop him"?

151
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,072
Now this ain't the way
you treat somebody.

152
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,027
Hey, Spanky, you know, you ain't
got to do that to that guy.

153
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,782
You don't have to drown him.
He's a square.

154
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,329
He didn't know who
he was fucking with.

155
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,327
Oh, no! Man, it's
filthy down there.

156
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,250
Oh! Damn, there's a rat.
Man, I hate rats.

157
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,670
But you do. What does
that say about you, Ray?

158
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,172
What does that
say about me, Ray?

159
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,750
Spank, look,
I'm just trying to get by.

160
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,959
Man, you remember
what it was like

161
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,135
when you first
started out, Spank.

162
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,134
Come on now.
Nigger, please.

163
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,721
Hey, Spank, wait a second. Hold on.
Hold on. Wait a second.

164
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:56,180
Look. Look. I want you to see this.
Look at this. Check this out.

165
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,479
I got access to that.

166
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,727
What is that, Ray?

167
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,729
Some more of
your bathtub brew?

168
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,527
Hell, no, Spanks, this come
up from the Mississippi, man.

169
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,445
I can get a lot
more of that, too.

170
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,943
I was thinking about going
into business for myself.

171
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,741
Under present circumstances, I
think I may take on a partner.

172
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,818
What you say?

173
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,323
I was supposed to
wear this suit on Monday!

174
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,745
Spank?
Oh!

175
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,874
If you give me the front
money and a truck...

176
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,372
Listen to me now. I think I can get
down there in two or three days,

177
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,453
<i>as long as I have somebody
to help me do the driving.</i>

178
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,048
Come on, now! All right,
now I'm really getting angry.

179
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,211
Come on, Spank.

180
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,140
I'm gonna tell
you something, Ray.

181
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,891
You fuck me on this, I'll
spare no expense on your ass.

182
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:41,982
I understand. I understand.
Do you hear me?

183
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,059
I hear you, Spank.

184
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,027
You got a deal.

185
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,229
All right, okay.

186
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,814
Pick a man and get
the fuck out of here.

187
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,650
Spank, with all due
respect to you gentlemen,

188
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,906
I think I'm gonna just take the
choirboy down there, Spank.

189
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,408
You got to be crazy.

190
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,622
If I'm gonna pick somebody, at
least I'm gonna pick somebody

191
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,746
who gonna be able to watch
my back in a tight squeeze.

192
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,123
I just wanna be with somebody that
ain't gonna put a bullet in my head

193
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,749
once the truck is full.
Lift him.

194
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,797
But not that you would do
something like that...

195
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:05,920
Lift him!

196
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,626
You know what
I mean, Spank.

197
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,594
Okay.
There you go.

198
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,930
Sure he
ain't dead, Spank?

199
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,431
Sure hope you can drive.

200
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,737
I'll tell you what though,
this little rum run we're doing

201
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,281
is gonna really improve my relationship
with Spanky, I'll tell you that.

202
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,237
He's a good man to
have on your side.

203
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,534
He got
the capital connections.

204
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,704
That's what you got to have in this
business, capital connections.

205
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,825
I'm gonna get me
the connections.

206
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,282
I ain't got no capital yet,
but I'm gonna get some.

207
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,537
I'm gonna get the connections,
then I'm gonna have my own place.

208
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,709
Don't get me wrong,
I like Spanky's,

209
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,876
but I'm gonna
have my own place.

210
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,330
Yeah. Get this.
I'm gonna call my place,

211
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,757
check this out,
Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

212
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,208
Don't that sound
like something?

213
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,839
Don't that sound like
a place where it's fun?

214
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,886
Sounds exciting.

215
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,760
Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
Yeah, I like that.

216
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,137
Hey, man, if you heard there was a
place called the Boom-Boom Room,

217
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,469
wouldn't you
wanna check it out?

218
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,851
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah, you'd want to.
Shit, yeah, you'd want to.

219
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,645
Whoo!
The Boom-Boom Room.

220
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,352
What you think?

221
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,235
Hey, you ain't said
nothing since we left.

222
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,989
I think the least you can do is give me
a little friendly conversation, boy.

223
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,994
I don't want
a friendly conversation.

224
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,822
I don't want to
be your friend.

225
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,456
I just want to do this thing and get back
to New York in time to start my job.

226
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,499
And what the hell
kind of job you got?

227
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:30,838
Well, if you must know, bank teller
at First Federal of Manhattan.

228
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,504
What's so funny?

229
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,307
Oh, I was laughing at myself, man.
Excuse me.

230
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,678
No, you found something very amusing.
What's so funny?

231
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,886
I don't know,
it's just, bank teller

232
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,392
just sound like
ladies' work to me.

233
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,018
It's something I always
pictured a woman doing.

234
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,193
Maybe I should dig around in other
people's pockets for money.

235
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,816
It's obviously been
highly successful for you.

236
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,273
Hey, you'd be surprised what you
find in other people's pockets.

237
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,653
Besides, I ain't never
heard of no man

238
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,904
setting out to
be no bank teller.

239
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:56,985
That's for damn shame.

240
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,820
This time next year,
I'll be a loan officer.

241
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,120
If I want to get
some frog skins

242
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,368
and come down to
the bank to get a loan,

243
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,666
I gotta come down and deal with a
tight-ass son of a bitch like you?

244
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,913
That's right.

245
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,085
Well, how do I
get a loan?

246
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,371
You? Yes, me. What's, "You?"

247
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,752
What is that shit? Why can't it be?
I can't get no money?

248
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,630
You need collateral.

249
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,427
What, you think I
ain't got collateral?

250
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,891
I have... Look at this. What about this here?
Look at that. Huh?

251
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,844
That thing?
Who'd you steal it from?

252
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,225
I ain't steal that. My daddy give
me that watch. Look at that.

253
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,348
Yeah,
well, who'd he steal it from?

254
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,270
Hey, you watch your mouth what you
say about my daddy. My daddy's dead.

255
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,858
You say whatever you
want to say about me,

256
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,314
but you can't drag
my daddy into it.

257
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,944
This watch is
sterling silver.

258
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,742
It's top-shelf,
top of the line,

259
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,490
and it's very near and
dear to my heart,

260
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,243
<i>so no wisecracks about it,
or I'll whup your ass.</i>

261
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,909
Looks like a fake to me.
Loan denied.

262
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,503
Hey, you know something, Claude?
Fuck you.

263
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,875
I'm gonna take
my business elsewhere.

264
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,629
And for future references, you will not
be welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

265
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,381
There's no
Boom-Boom Room.

266
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,677
When there is one.

267
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,255
When there is
a Boom-Boom Room,

268
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,466
don't come down to the motherfucker,
'cause you ain't getting in.

269
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,281
Smell that?

270
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,578
Yeah, I smell something.

271
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,654
Smells good, right?

272
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,330
Yeah, you know, I think maybe
we should go to another place.

273
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,376
The ambiance ain't
really very welcoming.

274
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,125
Are you kidding?
Tell me you don't want

275
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,831
one of these pies
right here, Ray.

276
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:33,881
Right over here.

277
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,630
Them pies look good, Claude, but
I kind of lost my appetite.

278
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,632
When I came in here,
my appetite just left me.

279
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,758
Good afternoon, Billy.

280
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,637
Uh, we'd like some coffee
and a couple slices of pie.

281
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,098
How do you know
my name is Billy?

282
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,472
<i>Well, it says it
right there on your shirt.</i>

283
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,230
If you boys can
read so good,

284
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,028
how come you missed that
sign on the door over there?

285
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,316
Oh, that sign on
the door that we just...

286
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,030
How come we
didn't see that sign

287
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,362
that say "No Coloreds
Allowed," Claude?

288
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,572
We just rushed in. We was really
hungry, so we kind of missed that.

289
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,749
But we see it now, so bye.
Come on, man.

290
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,371
Look, ma'am, we've been
traveling all day.

291
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,451
Yeah, let's go.

292
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,256
All we want is some coffee and a couple
slices of pie. Is that all right?

293
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,504
No. These are
whites-only pies.

294
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,169
Well, do you have
any Negro pies?

295
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,472
Hey, Claude,
come on, now.

296
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,595
This woman ain't got the
recipe to no Negro pie.

297
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,926
Where would she
get that recipe?

298
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,431
At another establishment
we can get us some pies.

299
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,263
How far to the next town?
Thirty-five miles.

300
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,563
Hey, come on,
let's get out of here.

301
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,607
I'm not driving
no 35 miles

302
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,775
to get no pie.

303
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,686
Lady! Ma'am!

304
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,778
Okay? Now we want some pie, okay?
We are hungry. Okay?

305
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,235
Billy, we want some pie.

306
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,868
Let me
take care of this.

307
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,036
Why does somebody
got to die

308
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,204
'cause we want some pie?

309
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,657
Let me take care of them.
Look here.

310
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,288
Look, we're from New York.
My name Ray Gibson, okay?

311
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,122
Let's talk turkey.
How much it gonna cost

312
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,957
to turn one of them white-only
pies into nigger pie?

313
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,044
How about I turn
y'all into nigger pie?

314
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,299
So you said about 35...

315
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,345
Thirty-five miles.

316
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,298
Maybe we find another
establishment down the road,

317
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,224
where we
won't have a problem.

318
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,725
Yeah, I didn't know white folks
so serious about pie down here.

319
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,203
Hey, we're looking for Slim.

320
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,404
You found him.

321
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:36,334
<i>That's it, fellas. 36 cases
of Mississippi's finest.</i>

322
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,174
Five bucks a case.
That's $180.

323
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,250
All right.

324
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,252
What do we got?
Come on. Pay the man.

325
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,258
Man, that music's hot. What
goes on down there, Slim?

326
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,264
That there's
Natchez-Under-The-Hill.

327
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,520
Really? Colored folks
welcome down there?

328
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,348
Green's the only color
that matters under the hill.

329
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,478
That right?

330
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,810
They got gambling, girls.

331
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,354
You boys ought
to check it out.

332
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,563
Maybe we will.

333
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,024
Nice doing
business with you, Slim.

334
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,528
Let's go down there, have
ourselves a little reward,

335
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,609
see what's shaking.

336
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,194
Reward?
Yes, a reward.

337
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,699
There's people down there
having a good time, man.

338
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,123
I wanna be one of them. Hey, man,
I want you to be one of them.

339
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,288
Let me tell you something. Listen to me.
Listen, listen.

340
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,414
Monday, you can go
be a bank teller.

341
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,121
But tonight you
are a bootlegger

342
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,839
with a truckload of
Mississippi's finest

343
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,465
and a fistful of cash.

344
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,001
That's gas money, Ray.

345
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,929
Come on. Think.

346
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,138
Man, you are incredible. Tell you what.
Here's two dollars.

347
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,844
You stay here and
watch the truck.

348
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,304
I'm gonna go have
myself a good time.

349
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,313
And I got the keys with me, in
case you want to leave a nigger

350
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,390
down here in the woods.

351
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,191
I know how you think,
you motherfucker you.

352
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,232
All right. Yeah. This look like something here.
I can work it here.

353
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:49,740
Hey, Ray. Keep an eye on you. Make
sure you don't do nothing stupid.

354
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,196
Oh, really?
Yeah.

355
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,205
All right. Well, put a little
something on your step.

356
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,409
I don't want these farmers
to think I'm from around here.

357
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,585
They know the way I walk,
I ain't from around here.

358
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,162
Yeah, 'cause I'm
from New York City.

359
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,877
How y'all doing?
What's up, country boy?

360
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,505
Cock-a-doodle-doo, nigger!

361
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,016
Tens over nines.

362
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,180
Oh!

363
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,363
I ain't never seen
you in here before.

364
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,079
That's 'cause I ain't never
been in here before.

365
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,907
My name's Sylvia.
What's your name?

366
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,083
Can't you remember
your own name?

367
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,046
I know it begins with a

368
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,376
Well, Mr. C.

369
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,131
How about buying a gal a drink?
Two bourbons.

370
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:56,224
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep
an eye on my friend over there.

371
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,972
He look like he can
take care of hisself.

372
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,253
Claude.

373
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,768
That's my name, Claude.

374
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,596
You know that's never
happened to me before.

375
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,480
You're cute.

376
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,939
Thank you.

377
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,109
You got
any money, Claude?

378
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:54,452
Yeah, two dollars,
but I need that to get home.

379
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,448
What's wrong?

380
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,367
What you wanna
go home for?

381
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,499
It's so early.

382
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,627
I'll take one.

383
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,090
One for New York.

384
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,882
Thank you.
Me's want one.

385
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,096
Can I get that for you, sir?
Thank you, baby.

386
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,844
Give me a deuce.

387
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,638
Here you go, honey.

388
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,556
Thank you.
All right.

389
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,604
You all want to pick
up this country pace?

390
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,016
Bet's to you, sir.

391
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,562
Bet a dollar.

392
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,189
I sees that.

393
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,236
You "sees" that?

394
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,487
Well, I sees that dollar,
and I raise you two dollars.

395
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:38,988
Is "sees" a word?

396
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,621
All right now.
I'm out.

397
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,417
What? You going back to the farm now?
Pick your tomatoes?

398
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,167
I'll see the two.

399
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,009
And I raise you $10.

400
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,840
Damn. Out.

401
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:08,526
Well, Mr. Hancock, I don't
think I have any more money.

402
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,986
Big city boy.

403
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,153
Well, that's too bad.

404
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,073
Now, hold on, now.

405
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,241
Just give me
two seconds.

406
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,264
Top-shelf.

407
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,055
It look good to me. I think
that'll cover it. Call.

408
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,067
I got a full boat with
the ladies doing the paddling.

409
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,447
Mmm-mmm!
- Whoo!

410
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,194
I don't think they come in
much stronger than that, sir.

411
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,663
Four threes.

412
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:04,998
What the fuck?

413
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,618
Goddamn.

414
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,917
Broke again.

415
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,917
New York, New York.

416
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,169
Don't take it too hard, New York.
Here, have a round on me.

417
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,056
Can I get you
something, sir?

418
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,182
No, I'm all right.

419
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,398
Hey. Hey!
What the fuck is this?

420
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,520
You're hurting my arm.

421
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,646
Where you going?
Where you going?

422
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,817
Where you going?
Come here.

423
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:37,524
Okay. No, no, no. Hell, no.
Hell, no! Hey, Hancock!

424
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,366
Hey. hey!

425
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,071
Oh, shit.

426
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,471
My goodness.

427
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:13,477
If it isn't my old friend,
Winston Hancock.

428
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,981
I thought we agreed that
you was gonna leave town.

429
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,782
Well,

430
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,361
I was gonna leave,
Sheriff Pike,

431
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,330
but your wife,
she begged me to stay.

432
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,350
You just
committed suicide, boy.

433
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,448
Hey, Ray,
I've been looking for you.

434
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,407
Guess we better
get going, huh?

435
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,117
Yeah. You still
got that two dollars?

436
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,792
Uh.

437
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,545
Not exactly.

438
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,209
You see, I met this girl.

439
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,883
Real nice girl, Ray.
A God-fearing girl.

440
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,752
The same girl I seen
you over here with?

441
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,804
Yeah, she looked religious.

442
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,597
Yeah, well...

443
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,018
Yeah. So you gave
her the two dollars?

444
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,515
Yeah, well she was
in a tight spot.

445
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,062
Her mama needs
this operation.

446
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,765
She ain't have the money
for it, and so, hey,

447
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,816
she tell me the church
took up a collection,

448
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,769
but they still
were short, so I...

449
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,229
Two dollars short?

450
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,697
Yeah.

451
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,321
Yeah, so I gave it to her. You
know, when the spirit moves me...

452
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,370
I guess we both got fucked. While
you was upstairs doing God's work,

453
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,536
I was over there
getting jack-legged

454
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,659
by one of these
fucking farmers

455
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,206
and one of these
goddamn waitresses.

456
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,658
I know the bitch is
in here somewhere.

457
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,459
They beat me down
to my goddamn socks.

458
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,962
You lost all our money
in a card game, Ray?

459
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,964
Fuck the money. It's not
even about the money.

460
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,837
Fuck the money.
I lost my daddy's watch.

461
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,089
Man, fuck that
cheap-ass watch, man.

462
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,718
Oh, I apologize.
It gotta stop some...

463
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,094
You right.
One more again,

464
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,301
one more again, see that I take
all your fronts out, I swear.

465
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,931
See how you go
back to New York.

466
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,813
That's how you gonna be back
in the car, all the way back there.

467
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,855
I'm sorry.
Fuck that.

468
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,808
Say something about the watch, Claude.
Bring up the watch.

469
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,685
In fact, just bring up watch.
Ray...

470
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,191
Look like you was fixing to make
your mouth up to say "watch."

471
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,944
<i>If I see you... I'm gonna whup your ass.
Ray, Ray...</i>

472
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,400
In fact, don't even
say "watch" no more.

473
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,699
You can't say
"watch" around me.

474
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,992
Say "little clock"
or some shit.

475
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,945
You say watch,
I'm gonna just dive on you.

476
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,747
How are we supposed to get
home without any money?

477
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,700
We got 36 cases of booze.
That's better than money.

478
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,332
Oh, okay. So we gonna
drive home drunk.

479
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,251
Is that it? Come on! Let me
pay and get out of here.

480
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,172
Hey, where's that girl
that was working over here?

481
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,340
What girl?
"What girl?"

482
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,884
Next time I come
back in here,

483
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,586
whichever bitch I start
choking, that's what girl.

484
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,670
Come on, man.

485
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,425
Big-time hustler, came and got
girked by a couple of farmers.

486
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,009
I'm gonna tell you something, Claude.
Can that twitter.

487
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,719
I'm all shot, and I just
wanna get back to New York.

488
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,894
What makes you think...

489
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,471
Ray, Ray.

490
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,937
Oh, shit.

491
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,900
I think he's hurt
pretty bad, man.

492
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,033
Hey, man, this guy's dead.

493
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,829
I ain't never seen no
dead body before, Ray.

494
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,163
What are you doing?

495
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,507
The man's been dead two seconds,
and you're in his pocket?

496
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,172
Don't you have any respect?

497
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,377
It ain't here.

498
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,380
What ain't there?
My daddy's watch.

499
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,806
This is the guy that
took my watch from me.

500
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,258
You motherfucker,
you fucked around with

501
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,809
the wrong person, didn't you?
Didn't you?

502
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,678
- Now look at your ass out here bleeding.
- Hey!

503
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,140
What you boys
doing out here?

504
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,567
Hey, how y'all doing?

505
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,520
Hi.

506
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,947
We're just taking care
of our friend here.

507
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,524
What's wrong
with this one?

508
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,068
Drink...

509
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,118
Yeah, he's just
a little drunk.

510
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,446
Nothing at all.
He's just a little drunk.

511
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,826
Nobody drink
like old...

512
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:55,952
Winston.

513
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,203
Winston, Winston, yeah.
Winston.

514
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,661
Yeah, he's always drinking. Old
drunk-ass Winston always drinking.

515
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,917
This fella look
like he's dead.

516
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,001
Oh, no. No, no, not...
He's not dead. He's drunk.

517
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,173
He is too drunk.

518
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,344
He likes to drink
until he pass out.

519
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,591
You know what'd
serve him right?

520
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,264
Just let him lay here
and sleep the shit off.

521
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,886
We gonna go. I'm gonna tell
his wife that we left him.

522
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,593
Let's go back to the car.
We gonna go...

523
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,390
I think you boys
better come with us.

524
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,891
That's right.

525
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,391
I think that... We're gonna
go to your car then.

526
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,817
Yeah, let's go.
Excuse me, Winston.

527
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,144
We're gonna go with
this gentleman here.

528
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,316
You know what, Ray?

529
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,192
You're responsible for this
whole situation. Yeah, yeah.

530
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,370
I blame you for everything, Ray.
Okay?

531
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,323
If it wasn't for you, man, I'd be home
right now about to have a hot meal.

532
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,953
If it wasn't for me,
your black ass would be

533
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,500
floating up on
a beach at Coney Island,

534
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,828
right now.
You forgot all that shit?

535
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,459
"I need all my finger and thumbs for
adding and..." You remember that shit?

536
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,582
I saved your life, nigger. They
think we killed somebody, Ray.

537
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,837
This is blood, okay?

538
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,133
Just shut up.
Listen.

539
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,382
<i>Just sit your ass down. Let me
work some shit out with this...</i>

540
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,678
I got a job
that starts Monday.

541
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,971
You're gonna
be late Monday,

542
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,051
'cause I got to work this
out, this whole thing.

543
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,516
Evening, boys.

544
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,939
Evening there, Sheriff.

545
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,732
Well, well, now.
What do we have here?

546
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,490
Billy Bob and the boys found them down
under the hill with Winston Hancock.

547
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,532
That's right.

548
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,860
He was dead.

549
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,786
Looks like murder.
Yeah.

550
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,326
Yep, it does.
Is that right?

551
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,289
Looks like they was running hooch.
Got 36 cases of evidence.

552
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,915
How about a little reward,
Billy Bob?

553
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,291
Well, thank you, sir.

554
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:33,004
Why bother with bootlegging when we
got us a clear-cut case of murder?

555
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,219
Hey, Sheriff Pike, like I told
your associate over there,

556
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,345
we didn't kill nobody.

557
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,892
The man was like
that when we found him.

558
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,477
He was out there dead.
He was already dead.

559
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,520
Now as far as
bootlegging goes,

560
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:47,147
well, I happen to work for a
very important man back east.

561
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:51,815
Yeah, yeah, does the name Spanky
Johnson mean anything to you?

562
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,115
Spanky Johnson?

563
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,985
No, I'm afraid not.

564
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,200
Hey, hey, Sheriff Pike.
Sheriff Pike, listen.

565
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,990
Listen.

566
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,494
This guy, Spanky Johnson,
is very well-connected.

567
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,577
Ooh!

568
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,756
Very well-connected. And if
you were to give us a break,

569
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,427
I can guarantee you, he would do
something to show his appreciation.

570
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,719
Now I'm sure.

571
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,968
Mr. Pike.

572
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,682
I don't doubt that
you can buy your way

573
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,259
out of trouble
up in New York City,

574
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,846
but down here, we take
murder very seriously.

575
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,101
We didn't kill nobody.

576
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,727
I keep telling you, the man
was dead when we found him.

577
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:27,899
He was already dead.

578
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,022
He's telling
the honest truth.

579
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,478
Now the liquor was ours.
That's our liquor.

580
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,937
There was no breath in him.
We're being truthful.

581
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,146
But that man's
being honest.

582
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,823
That was our liquor.
But the man was dead.

583
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,320
If that's the truth,
you boys don't have

584
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,777
anything to worry
about then, do you?

585
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,867
I guarantee it. I'll see
y'all in the morning.

586
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,200
You believe us, right? What time
you gonna be here in the morning?

587
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,956
Boys, don't drink all that
stuff tonight, you hear?

588
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,036
All right, Sheriff.

589
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,497
See you in the morning.
Wait a minute.

590
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,173
He sounded like he
believed us, right, man?

591
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:56,129
The man's got a point.
We didn't kill nobody, Ray.

592
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,464
Hey, Claude, what about the
truckload of booze, man?

593
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,845
Man, that's Spanky's booze!
You know what?

594
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,176
Tomorrow,
I'm gonna tell that judge,

595
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,933
"Judge, we didn't
murder nobody.

596
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,639
"That was Spanky's booze."

597
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,896
What's the worst that can
happen to us, Ray? Huh?

598
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,609
Life!

599
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,571
What do you mean, "life"? Hell,
no, I ain't doing no life.

600
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,065
This is a mistrial!

601
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,537
I didn't even kill nobody. The
man was dead when I got there.

602
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,860
<i>Welcome to Mississippi.</i>

603
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,064
<i>Here, you will be provided
with ample opportunity</i>

604
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:01,653
<i>to repay your debt to society
through the rigors of hard labor.</i>

605
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:06,282
<i>We got fields need clearing,
roads need building,</i>

606
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,538
<i>and ditches need digging.</i>

607
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,960
<i>You will eat only
what you can grow.</i>

608
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,872
<i>Your crop don't come in,
you go hungry.</i>

609
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,837
<i>This here is Camp 8.</i>

610
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,384
Camp 8 is for incorrigibles.

611
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,215
But whatever you done
to get here,

612
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,800
believe me,
I'm not impressed.

613
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,885
I've seen it all before.

614
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,849
We ain't got no fences
here at Camp 8.

615
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,778
We don't need no fences.
We got us the gun line.

616
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,195
Tell them about
the gun line, boss.

617
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,566
This is the gun line.

618
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,074
It runs from shack to shack
clear around the yard.

619
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,583
You are now
inside the gun line.

620
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:55,335
You step outside the gun line without
my permission, you will be shot.

621
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,920
You trip and fall over the
gun line, you will be shot.

622
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,095
You spit, you pee,

623
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,845
you so much as stick your
Johnson out over the gun line,

624
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,847
you will be shot.

625
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:15,018
And you, Slick, don't try to
run, don't try to escape.

626
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,524
One of my trustees will put
a bullet in your head.

627
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:25,410
You prisoners are now the property
of the state of Mississippi,

628
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,237
which is to say
I own your ass.

629
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,412
And in case you haven't met
this handsome young fella,

630
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,209
this is Hoppin' Bob.

631
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,710
You run afoul of Bob,
you run afoul of me.

632
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,219
Everybody, shut up!
Right now.

633
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,595
I don't wanna hear a sound.
Got some fresh meat for you.

634
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,720
Right down there.

635
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,927
Take yourself right down
there, find your ass a bunk.

636
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,889
Move it.
Acting all scared.

637
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,731
We ain't got no wallflowers
here in Camp 8.

638
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,733
Don't y'all worry none.

639
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,611
Ain't nobody gonna
mess with you tonight.

640
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,693
That'd take all the fun
out of the courtship.

641
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,616
You hear me, boy?

642
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,533
<i>I didn't see nothing special
the first time Ray and Claude</i>

643
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,664
<i>walked into the cage.</i>

644
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:19,214
<i>To me, they were just a couple
of fools whose luck had run out.</i>

645
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,752
<i>Course,
I was wrong about that.</i>

646
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,956
I don't believe
this "before Abe" shit.

647
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,791
I didn't go to night
school to dig no ditch.

648
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,049
What the hell you doing? Don't do that.
I wouldn't do that shit.

649
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,005
Oh, man, shut up.
What do you know anyway?

650
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,807
Okay?
It's too damn hot.

651
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,142
Why ain't that
boy's pick swinging?

652
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,437
Why ain't that
pick swinging?

653
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,685
Why ain't that
pick swinging, nigger?

654
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,734
It's too hot.
I'm tired, boss.

655
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:24,817
He said he's too hot, boss.
He's tired.

656
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,986
Too hot?
He's tired?

657
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,233
Uh-huh.

658
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,536
You tell that lazy jigaboo
the state of Mississippi

659
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,036
ain't interested in his
meteorological assessments!

660
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,038
Listen up, jigaboo!

661
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:40,587
The state of Mississippi
ain't interested in your...

662
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:44,838
Your, uh, "metacalogical"
assessments!

663
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,090
You tell him the state of
Mississippi is only interested

664
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,797
in getting this here ditch
cleared by sundown.

665
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,601
State of Mississippi wants this
here ditch cleared by sundown.

666
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,019
You got that, boy?

667
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,730
<i>Got it, boss.</i>

668
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,272
He don't sound like
he from around here.

669
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,524
He from New York City, boss.
That one there, too.

670
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,236
They'll find we do things
different down here.

671
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,114
Yeah, we noticed.

672
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,531
Don't smart me, boy.

673
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,333
You just shut your mouth and do your work.
You got that?

674
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,875
Looks like we got
a couple of live ones.

675
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,460
How long these boys in for?

676
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,092
The judge gave them
the long ride, boss.

677
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,014
Life, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

678
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,887
Well, they step
out of line again,

679
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,310
we'll shorten up
that sentence real fast.

680
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,559
Get them picks a-swinging!
You heard me, New York Cities.

681
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,936
You don't want me
to come down there.

682
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:50,779
I ain't nice like Boss. I'll
slap the black off your ass.

683
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,571
Get to work!

684
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,243
Either one of you new
fellas know how to read?

685
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,873
I know how to read.
Why?

686
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,080
I've been carrying this
letter for four months now.

687
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,340
You mean to tell me,
none of y'all can read?

688
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,045
Last fella what could read made
parole, what, around Christmas.

689
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,505
I don't even know
who this come from.

690
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,929
Give me that.

691
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,724
You can't read?

692
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,556
Almost 60 years old,
motherfucker can't read.

693
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,564
Here. Look, it's from your
mama's neighbor, Mrs. Tadwell.

694
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:27,690
You know who
that is, Mrs. Tadwell?

695
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,864
She thought you ought to know
that your second cousin Bo died.

696
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:35,035
Bo died. And your other cousin,
Sally, on your daddy's side,

697
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,157
she died.

698
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,538
And apparently
your sister died, too.

699
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,739
Jenny?

700
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,371
No, it say Marleen here.
Marleen died.

701
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,827
Oh, no, no, no.
Marleen...

702
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,130
Jenny died, too.
Jenny and Marleen both dead.

703
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,378
Then it goes on
for a while about how

704
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,051
the crop didn't come in
on the account of the frost.

705
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,712
She finished up with...

706
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,764
There's been a big tornado,

707
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,138
in which your mama and your
daddy were both killed.

708
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,520
Well, don't worry, 'cause she
gonna take care of the dog.

709
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,441
That is, if he gets over the worms.
Dog had worms.

710
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,063
Appreciate it.

711
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,521
Yeah, you know,
anytime I can help out.

712
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,615
Anybody else got
something they want read?

713
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,112
No.
No.

714
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,192
Can't blame y'all.

715
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,499
Hey, hey. hey,
how you doing?

716
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,701
I'm fine, thanks.

717
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,955
Good. First time in?

718
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,294
Nah, not at all.

719
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,252
I've been in and out
of prison, mostly in.

720
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,510
So you won't have
no problem adjusting?

721
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,384
Shouldn't have
a problem, no.

722
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:46,019
If you need anything of any
kind, give me a holler.

723
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,267
My name's Jangle Leg,
Jangle Leg.

724
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,444
I appreciate it.
Jangle Leg, you said?

725
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,112
Jangle Leg, Jangle Leg.

726
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,610
I'm Claude.
Claude.

727
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,032
Yeah, Claude.

728
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,362
Your hand nice and supple,
like a lady.

729
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,330
Jangle Leg!

730
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,997
What the hell I tell you about
pitching woo on the job, boy?

731
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,797
Sorry, Captain.

732
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,671
Story time is over.
All you sissies

733
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,502
get back to work right now.
Let's move it!

734
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,504
Now!
What the fuck?

735
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,214
Y'all heard the man,
get on line!

736
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,594
Let's go, boys!

737
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,101
<i>He made a pass at me.</i>

738
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,224
Yeah, I see.

739
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,775
Why do you think they
call him Jangle Leg?

740
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,352
You're gonna
find out before me.

741
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,326
Eyes front, mister.

742
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,493
Ain't nobody
doing nothing.

743
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,953
I'm hungry. What...

744
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,556
See how you get that off?

745
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,683
Fuck that. You better eat,
and stop aggravating people.

746
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,105
I ain't
aggravating nobody.

747
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,853
You got nerve,
scraping toast and shit,

748
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,275
making excess noise.
Come on, Ray.

749
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,193
You're making a lot
of noise down there.

750
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,021
Look at this spoon,
man, it's filthy.

751
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,527
Filthy, ain't it? Fuck
that spoon, and just eat.

752
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,358
Be cool.

753
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,201
My name's Ray Gibson,
and this is Claude Banks.

754
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,367
Willie Long.
Willie Long.

755
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,571
Willie, huh?
Mmm.

756
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,077
Pretty sensible man.

757
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,624
What you up in here for?
It's a long story.

758
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,670
He killed son of a bitch with a claw
hammer when he was 13-year-old.

759
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,709
So they say. A lot of
people say it, though.

760
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,883
Wait a second. You been in
here since you were 13?

761
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,585
That's right.
How about you, boy?

762
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:39,715
How long you been in here?
What'd you do?

763
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,888
Son of a bitch chopped his
sister in the head with an ax.

764
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,887
She was my half-sister,
so I cuts her ass in half.

765
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,684
At least I ain't the one
who poisoned my own ma and pa.

766
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,102
Now tell that.
Tell that.

767
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,303
They deserved it, Radio.

768
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,730
What you talking about,
Biscuit?

769
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,603
You're the one that skinned
your landlady alive

770
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:53,774
and made a jacket
out of her.

771
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,727
Well, at least he
didn't kill Santa Claus.

772
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,526
Santa Claus? Which one of you
niggers killed Santa Claus?

773
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:00,903
It wasn't the Santa Claus.

774
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,905
He was just wearing the suit
and ringing a bell.

775
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:03,985
- Damn, that's true.
- He had presents.

776
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,069
I ain't get nothing.

777
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,496
You killed one of
them Salvation men,

778
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,414
them dudes be out there
on the street with a bell?

779
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,241
Something like that.
That's what he did.

780
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,372
Anybody try to
escape from here?

781
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,919
They run,
but they never get too far.

782
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,838
Cookie there made it clear to
Greenville a couple of years back.

783
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,507
Take a mighty cagey
country boy to navigate

784
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,084
his way through
them wood and bayous.

785
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,676
Gotta know what you're doing.
Mmm-hmm.

786
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,925
Hey, what y'all did?

787
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,923
Oh.
Uh...

788
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,266
What the fuck
y'all do?

789
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,309
Uh...

790
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,267
Well, we went on a...

791
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,356
Yeah, a violent killing spree.
The most violent, you know.

792
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,276
All around the country, we've been
killing people. All this month.

793
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:40,196
All month, man. If y'all was out
and was reading the papers...

794
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,198
You ain't heard about it?
Claude and Ray?

795
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,158
Claude and Ray?
Fuck it. You know,

796
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,951
sometimes you got
to do certain shit.

797
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,780
It's just enough
that people know that

798
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,786
I go where I need
to go to get it done.

799
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,410
If you push my button, there's
no telling what I may do.

800
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,536
Stab you, choke you, bite you.
Yeah, don't give a fuck.

801
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,622
I mean, whatever it take to make
a motherfucker stop existing.

802
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,706
I will do that.

803
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,259
I wish this spoon was sharp,
I'd stab a nigger right now.

804
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,382
I bit one motherfucker to death.
You don't wanna fuck with us.

805
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,760
No, you don't really
wanna fuck with us.

806
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,967
Press the wrong button,
nigger pop.

807
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,305
Hey, girl. You gonna
eat your corn bread?

808
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,436
Oh, trouble.

809
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,893
Don't say nothing to him.

810
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,936
You talking to me?

811
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:22,606
Yeah, I think he's
talking to you.

812
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,489
Uh. No, not at all.
I want you to have it.

813
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,204
Willie, you mind
passing this down to...

814
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,952
<i>Hey, no. Don't pass
your corn bread to him.</i>

815
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,123
That's your corn bread.

816
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,496
Ray, I'm a grown man.
Okay?

817
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,701
I'm not gonna eat
this corn bread.

818
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,129
If he wants the corn bread,
damn it, have the corn bread.

819
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,956
If he wants some corn bread,
let him up to the front

820
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,416
and get his own
portion of corn bread.

821
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,172
That's your corn bread.
Fuck him.

822
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,720
Hey, man, he gonna eat his corn
bread, all right? Fuck you.

823
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:49,641
Ray, look, I don't need
you to take up for me.

824
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,764
I'm all right. I'm a grown man.
I can handle that.

825
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,095
If you let him
have your corn bread,

826
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,305
you're gonna be ironing his drawers
and clipping his toenails.

827
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,389
I ain't gonna be ironing.

828
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,191
Maybe I ought to
eat your corn bread.

829
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,896
Motherfucker, you can't have my
corn bread, that's for damn sure.

830
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,607
'Cause if you try to take my corn
bread, part two of my killing spree

831
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,658
<i>gonna begin up in here
on your ass right now.</i>

832
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,156
If you're thinking
about my corn bread,

833
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,612
better get the taste
out of your mouth.

834
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,118
That's for damn sure.
No, fuck him, fuck that.

835
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,915
'Cause I'm from New
York City, God damn it.

836
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,206
Nobody take
no corn bread from me.

837
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,287
That go for you and any other
of you motherfucking farmers

838
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,542
wanna try some shit.

839
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,747
You fuck around with me,

840
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,129
there's gonna be consequences
and repercussions.

841
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,131
Oh!

842
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,594
Get up!

843
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,067
Come on, New York!

844
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,865
Show that big son of a bitch how
y'all does it up in Harlem now, boy.

845
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,150
Come on!

846
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,593
Come on, New York.
Come on, New York.

847
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,024
I appreciate you going through all
the trouble over my corn bread.

848
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,525
You don't get a lot of
compliments around here.

849
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,576
Get up! Get up!

850
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:43,793
Ray, I think you made your
point, whatever that is.

851
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:47,546
Now's a good time to throw in the
towel, you know what I'm saying?

852
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,429
Not over no
corn bread, man.

853
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:02,228
Goldmouth, I know a bitch named
Della hit harder than you.

854
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,860
That's it. The man's taken
enough of a beating.

855
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,913
Goldmouth, pick him up
and carry him on inside.

856
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,417
He ain't getting
my corn bread, Claude.

857
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:42,268
You were scared, huh? Don't be scared.
Uh-uh. Don't be scared.

858
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,883
Papa!

859
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,090
That's my boy.

860
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,929
Request permission to
go to the tonk, boss.

861
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,475
Conjugal visits are
for married prisoners only,

862
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,644
and I don't see
no wedding ring.

863
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,105
Can't you make an exception,
just this once?

864
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,156
I could issue a temporary marriage
license, for a nominal fee.

865
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,370
Here you go.

866
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,621
Sure is pretty.

867
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,462
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

868
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,540
You go have a good time.

869
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,590
Claude Banks
going to the tonk!

870
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,138
Claude Banks
heading for the tonk!

871
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,798
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

872
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,508
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy.

873
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,226
Come on, now.
Five cents.

874
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,721
- That's right. That's a nickel apiece.
- Want my money back...

875
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,648
Hey, New York. You ever been
to that there Cotton Club?

876
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,438
The Cotton Club in Manhattan?
Many times.

877
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,111
Man, I damn near
lived in the Cotton Club.

878
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,029
I tell you,
Cotton Club is all right,

879
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,778
but they ain't got nothing
on the Boom-Boom Room.

880
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,279
You ever go to New York,
go to Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

881
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,862
Hey, there, Ray, what is that you
talking about the Boom-Boom Room?

882
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,072
That's my spot.
Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

883
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,032
Most happening space
in all of Manhattan.

884
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,201
So you got
your own nightclub?

885
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,203
Right now it's kind of
in the development stages,

886
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:30,539
but I'm working on it.
I'm gonna get it.

887
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,002
So it don't exist?

888
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,459
It exists in my mind, Goldmouth.
That's where it start.

889
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,512
It start your brain first. You know,
it got to exist up here first.

890
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,089
As a man thinketh,
so shall he get.

891
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,674
Some shit like that. You
know, you read the Bible.

892
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,720
Did you go see
my cousin Melvin

893
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,555
like I asked you
to in my letter?

894
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,437
Of course I did. He said he'd
file an appeal right away.

895
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,029
Listen, Claude,
Melvin wanted to know

896
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,152
if he should file an appeal
on behalf of your friend, too.

897
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,364
Ray Gibson? No.

898
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:05,081
No. No. No.
No, Daisy.

899
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,409
He's the reason
I'm in here.

900
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,710
For all I know, he's got
a record a mile long.

901
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,255
I got a better shot of getting
out of here on my own.

902
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,299
You tell Melvin to think
about me, all right?

903
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,718
Just concentrate on me.
Claude.

904
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,179
Cookie made me
a map to Greenville.

905
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,476
So?

906
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,974
So, nigger,
you know what I'm saying.

907
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,431
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

908
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,727
And guess what
I'm saying.

909
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,228
If you made it that far,
they'd be checking

910
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,060
every train that
pulls out of that station.

911
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,020
We ain't taking the train.
There's a farm on the map.

912
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,776
Cookie told me
there's a boat on the farm.

913
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,450
What do you know about boats? You
probably don't even know how to swim.

914
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,368
I know a boat can help
sail our ass away from here.

915
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,321
Come on, nigger, we can do this shit.
Stop bullshitting.

916
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,198
Why are you always talking about "we"?
Say what?

917
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,751
There's no "we," Ray, okay?
There's a me, there's a you.

918
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,123
Why are you
talking so loud?

919
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,046
There ain't no "we"
between us.

920
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,888
Hey, Ray! Ray!

921
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,222
Yeah?

922
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,562
What's the name of that there
nightclub of yours again?

923
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,064
You talking about
the Boom-Boom Room?

924
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,770
Yeah, the Boom-Boom Room.

925
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,527
That's it. Boy, I'd sure
like to see that place

926
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,483
when you get it all up and
running and pretty-looking.

927
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,110
Yeah, me, too, Ray.

928
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,446
Me, too. I'd like to
see that room, too.

929
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,156
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
though, Radio.

930
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,741
You should've been
by there last night.

931
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,292
You'd have had
yourself some big fun.

932
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,085
What you talking about,
"There last night"?

933
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,583
Just like I said,
last night.

934
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,007
Satchmo was up in there and nearly
blew the roof off the place.

935
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,462
Ray, who that?

936
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,634
Satchmo.

937
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,336
You mean Louis...
Louis Armstrong?

938
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,263
Yeah, Satchmo, that's what I call him.
I know him personally.

939
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,340
Whenever he come by my spot,
I call him Satchmo,

940
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,801
and he come by
whenever he in town.

941
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:52,013
Hey, ain't nobody trying
to hear that bullshit, man.

942
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,435
Shut the fuck up, man!

943
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:54,561
Just shut up.

944
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,608
You always trying to say
something at the wrong time.

945
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:57,776
Let him finish, and do
whatever you got to do.

946
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,321
Go to sleep.
Let us have our fun.

947
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,364
Go ahead there, Ray. Finish
telling us about that Satchmo.

948
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,737
Go on. Tell me some more.
Go ahead, Ray.

949
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,614
Continue, Ray.
Damn!

950
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:09,618
As I was saying, last night
y'all should've come by, man.

951
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,075
Big fun. But y'all will never
guess who gonna be there tonight.

952
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,701
Who gonna be there, Ray?
Who that there?

953
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,206
Who?
Who that, Ray?

954
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,458
<i>Just guess.</i>

955
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,014
You go, Biscuit.
Sing, girl.

956
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,060
That's right, fellas.
Catch any cab heading uptown

957
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,147
because all the drivers know
about Ray's Boom-Boom Room.

958
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,152
Hey, Ray!
Where am I?

959
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,693
Oh, come on, Goldmouth,
somebody's gotta watch the door.

960
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,917
Hey, Ray! Now I could get
used to this. Ladies.

961
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,708
Mmm!

962
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,415
Ray, this steak
tastes like butter.

963
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,092
Made it just
for you, Cookie.

964
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,168
You got some steak sauce?

965
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,504
Boy, get us some
Worcestershire sauce.

966
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,181
And clean off that damn table,
or I'll whup your ass.

967
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,937
Is something wrong with your ears?
Move it!

968
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,520
Hey, Ray! I know
your club got gambling.

969
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,894
Poker. Wouldn't be
a club without some dice.

970
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,653
Lucky seven! My man!
Let it ride!

971
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,276
All right,
Poker, letting it ride.

972
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,319
Yes!

973
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,199
Raid! Don't move!

974
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,704
Oh, shit!
Party's over.

975
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:37,831
Son of a bitch!

976
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,082
Goddamn! Party over.

977
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,256
Get the back door! Put all
the women in my car! Gibson!

978
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,126
You about ready to spend
the night in the hole, boy.

979
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,130
Now shut up and go to sleep.
You got that, boy?

980
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,593
Huh?

981
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,972
That goes for
the rest of you girls, too.

982
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,099
Now I don't wanna
hear another peep

983
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,180
about no fucking
Boom-Boom Room.

984
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:01,850
Sorry, Captain.

985
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,312
Shut your mouth and
your fat ass, boy.

986
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,816
Don't be playing with yourselves.
You gotta work in the morning.

987
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,323
Come on, come on.

988
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,164
Mail call!

989
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,492
That's mine.

990
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,044
You know, I
hate this part.

991
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:24,499
I'm gonna get back to that
game in a little while.

992
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,757
Craddock.
Craddock.

993
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,463
- All right.
- Williams!

994
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,173
- Williams!
- Williams!

995
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,467
Banks.
Banks.

996
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:35,764
Right here.

997
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,845
"Melvin Banks,
Esquire, Attorney at Law"?

998
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,020
What's going on?

999
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,393
This don't concern you.

1000
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,940
- Excuse me.
- M. Bay.

1001
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,188
Oh, yeah,
obviously not.

1002
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,106
- Yeah.
- M. Bay.

1003
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,607
Slow up, slow up.
You see me counting.

1004
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,692
Go on. Come on.

1005
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,617
This here is Biscuit.
This is New York City One.

1006
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,323
All right, let's get a move on!
New York City Two.

1007
00:51:57,406 --> 00:52:00,535
Only 15 hours
of daylight left.

1008
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,832
Got all my
rocks here, boss.

1009
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:09,461
Phew! Sure is hot. Think
it's gonna rain later?

1010
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,090
Now what you want?

1011
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,467
What I want? What makes you
think I want something?

1012
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,638
My daddy told me
when motherfuckers

1013
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,806
start talking
about the weather,

1014
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:15,849
keep your hand
on your wallet.

1015
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,050
Now what you want?

1016
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,636
Your daddy must
have been a wise man.

1017
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,187
A hell of a man.
Cut the shit

1018
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,639
and tell me what
you want, Claude.

1019
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,390
You still got that map?

1020
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,775
Yeah, I still got it. Why?

1021
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,072
Well, if you thinking about
booking it, I want in.

1022
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,030
I think we can make it.

1023
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,737
We? Ain't you the one
told me wasn't no we?

1024
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,367
Now you wanna be we again?
What happened?

1025
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,165
We get some bad news in that
letter back there, nigger?

1026
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:43,870
Look, my cousin Melvin
is a lawyer

1027
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,000
and he filed an appeal
on my behalf.

1028
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,708
On your behalf? What happened to "we," Claude?
What happened to "we."

1029
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,921
Ray, the appeal
was denied.

1030
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,001
Well, I'm glad.

1031
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:52,803
Then Daisy went
and fell for Melvin.

1032
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,505
Now they're
engaged to be married.

1033
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,840
Can you believe that?

1034
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,140
That's hard to believe.

1035
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,684
He a big, successful
New York lawyer,

1036
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,932
and you down here with a bright
future in the cotton industry.

1037
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,515
Let me figure it out for you.
Eenie, meenie, miney, Melvin!

1038
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,356
Come on, Ray.
Look, I'm serious.

1039
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,530
Don't shut me out. You, me,
the map, we can go places.

1040
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,158
You know something, Claude? The
whole time we been down here,

1041
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,110
you don't do nothing but
blame this whole shit on me.

1042
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,491
That's all you did. And you don't do
nothing but think about yourself.

1043
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,823
Your little scheme that you had.
Was I part of that?

1044
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,624
No. All right. You're
gonna be honest now

1045
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,872
'cause you wanna
be my friend.

1046
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,168
Wanna be my friend
now, huh?

1047
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,918
Let me tell you something Claude "Mr.
My Shit Don't Stink" Banks,

1048
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,839
you got to learn a whole
lot more about friendship.

1049
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,633
A lot more.
Lot more!

1050
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,632
Hey, boss,
he ain't working!

1051
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,057
Does this mean I'm in?

1052
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,930
Nah, you'd probably
just slow me down.

1053
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,305
You're gonna be out
there worrying about

1054
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,887
your silverware being
clean and all that shit.

1055
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,348
You one of them
soft motherfuckers.

1056
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,899
What you say?

1057
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,483
I said you soft.
So what?

1058
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,777
What you gonna do?
Don't no man call me soft.

1059
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:51,945
I hate that,
all right?

1060
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,363
Let me slow you down
'cause I'm a man,

1061
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,736
and I called you soft,
first of all.

1062
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,317
And I don't like
you swelling all up

1063
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,868
and all. What's all
this swell-up shit?

1064
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,241
What's that about? What you taking
in all this air for, Claude?

1065
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,163
What you feeling, huh?
What's on your mind, huh?

1066
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,079
What, you gonna put your chin up, huh?
That mean something to me?

1067
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,161
'Cause I said "soft"?
So what?

1068
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:11,169
I say it, I spell it.
S-O-F-capital-T! Soft!

1069
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,838
Huh? How you like that? What you gonna do, Claude?
What you gonna do, huh?

1070
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:20,053
Hell, no. You must be crazy, nigger.
I'll kill you.

1071
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,599
Oh, this is good.

1072
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,848
Break it up!
Break it up!

1073
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,229
God damn it!

1074
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,940
Shit! I'm getting ready to shoot
somebody here, God damn it!

1075
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,741
I'm gonna shoot a motherfucker today.
Okay, okay.

1076
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,819
Ain't gonna forget this shit,
you New York Cities.

1077
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,407
He started it.

1078
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,785
Don't go to sleep, nigger.

1079
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,161
I don't mess with
nobody around here!

1080
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,537
Knocking me down.

1081
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:47,993
You knew that...

1082
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,703
Fucking knock me
down in the dirt for.

1083
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,301
You know what "back to work" means, boy?
It means back to work!

1084
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,759
This ain't over, nigger. I
don't give a fuck what he say.

1085
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,131
I'm gonna shoot your ass.
That's right.

1086
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,261
Don't go to sleep!

1087
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,466
Don't you go to sleep.

1088
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,263
We'll see who
go to sleep.

1089
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,735
Come on, come on!
Two running!

1090
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,412
I know these
trees all look alike,

1091
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,338
but this one is
awful familiar.

1092
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,336
Let me see that map.

1093
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,342
You call this a map?

1094
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,048
What was Cookie smoking
when he drew this?

1095
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,263
Cookie didn't draw it.
I drew it up.

1096
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,594
You drew this?

1097
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:49,805
Ray, we out here in
the middle of nowhere.

1098
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,356
Don't tell me you don't know
where we're going.

1099
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,310
I drew it up 'cause I knew your ass
wouldn't come unless I had a map.

1100
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,441
Now come on.
Come on, Claude!

1101
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,115
Wait up. Wait up!

1102
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:32,481
Come on!

1103
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,894
Take the dogs
around the house!

1104
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,480
Y'all bring the dogs with me!
Come on! Keep moving!

1105
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,490
Come on.
Come on!

1106
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,248
Come on! Come on!

1107
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,634
Here they are,
Superintendent.

1108
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,761
Tracked them all the way
to the Tallahatchie.

1109
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,343
Well, that's quite a ways,
isn't it?

1110
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,433
Well, I'm glad you New York
boys got to see some of

1111
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,890
our beautiful countryside
while we got you down here.

1112
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,650
Mae Rose!

1113
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,061
Honey, what you think
we ought to do

1114
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,737
with these two to
teach them a lesson, huh?

1115
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,072
Um...

1116
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:24,775
A night in the hole?

1117
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,987
A night in the hole?
Better make it a week.

1118
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,887
I told you, I don't
move so fast in this shit.

1119
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,237
Fuck y'all!

1120
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,402
Hey, Claude!

1121
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,482
What?

1122
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,408
You got a toilet
in yours?

1123
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,158
<i>That was the first
time that Ray and Claude ran,</i>

1124
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,989
<i>but it sure
wasn't the last.</i>

1125
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,746
<i>Japan suffers its
most crushing defeat of the war.</i>

1126
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,827
<i>- General Douglas MacArthur. ..
- Years passed,</i>

1127
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,164
<i>and the world went to
war for a second time.</i>

1128
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:24,760
<i>While they was fighting
for freedom on the outside,</i>

1129
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:28,681
<i>why, we were dreaming
about it on the inside.</i>

1130
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,595
Camp 8 is
for incorrigibles.

1131
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,177
So whatever you
done to get here,

1132
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,764
believe me, I'm not impressed.
I've seen it all before.

1133
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,102
You probably noticed that we ain't
got no fences here at Camp 8.

1134
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:45,030
We don't need no fences 'cause
we got this here gun line.

1135
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,277
It runs from...

1136
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,074
What the hell you doing, boy?
What is your problem?

1137
00:58:55,157 --> 00:59:00,505
Excuse me, boss, but the boy can't talk.
Something wrong with his head.

1138
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,248
Just can't get right, boss.

1139
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,719
"Can't get right."

1140
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,263
All right. We'll see
how long he lasts.

1141
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,464
Now, where was I?

1142
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,050
We don't need no fences
at Camp 8, boss.

1143
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,510
Oh, no. What?

1144
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,016
We don't need no fences
here at Camp 8, boss.

1145
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,604
The gun line, boss.

1146
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,398
Yes. Yes.

1147
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,026
You prisoners are now
inside the gun line...

1148
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,105
<i>When Dillard found out
that Claude was a baseball man,</i>

1149
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:28,190
<i>he put him in charge
of the team.</i>

1150
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:31,527
<i>That way, when we lost, he could
blame it on somebody else.</i>

1151
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,701
No, no, that's not it.

1152
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,416
You know, try to teach them
the finer points of the game,

1153
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:48,469
share my wisdom,
but do they listen?

1154
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,591
They damn sure
don't learn.

1155
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,431
I tell you what. What you're dealing
with is a total lack of talent.

1156
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,430
Ain't nobody
got no talent.

1157
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,556
Come on, here.

1158
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,262
Every year Camp 12
wins the championship.

1159
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:01,815
Every year they get to roast a victory pig.
This year, I want that pig.

1160
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:05,061
Jangle Leg,
put it right to him, man.

1161
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:12,067
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Radio, yes!

1162
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,944
Who wants to hit next?

1163
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,028
Find the card.

1164
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,580
Don't nobody wanna hit?

1165
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,874
What, do you wanna hit?

1166
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,997
Hey, man, let Can't Get
Right have a swing.

1167
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,499
Him?
Come on, now.

1168
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,251
He can't be no worse
than the rest of them boys.

1169
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:26,631
Ray, I...

1170
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,832
Come on.
Let the boy have a swing.

1171
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:28,917
Go on.
Take a swing at that.

1172
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,092
All right. Come on.

1173
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,677
Go on there.
Have a swing at the ball.

1174
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,175
Let's see
what you can do.

1175
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,303
All right,
put that bat in your hand,

1176
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,680
hold it real tight,
and take a nice swing.

1177
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,102
You gonna be all right.

1178
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,347
Jangle Leg,
a little easy on him.

1179
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,057
He's new,
so we don't wanna...

1180
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,064
Yeah, don't try to
hurt the man, you know.

1181
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,316
Take it easy on him.

1182
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,407
Even swing,
there, Can't Get Right.

1183
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,993
Swing it now. Don't be
scared of the ball.

1184
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,322
Whoo!

1185
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,666
Shit.

1186
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,496
That wasn't bad.

1187
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,923
Put that on it.
That... Yeah.

1188
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:11,047
That might have been one of them,
you know, retard mistakes.

1189
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,591
Ha! Let's try it.

1190
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:19,051
Put it right here.

1191
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,641
Yeah, give him
that tricky one.

1192
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,439
Yeah, Can't Get Right. That
motherfucker can hit, yeah.

1193
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,157
Damn.

1194
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,873
Hey, boy.
Daddy!

1195
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,295
That's just like fresh water.

1196
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,338
Hey, my little girl.

1197
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,876
Look like little Mae
Rose done growed up.

1198
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:52,959
And out.

1199
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,428
That girl got gams.

1200
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:57,555
How was the honeymoon?

1201
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,304
Tom, now, you are gonna stay
for supper, aren't you?

1202
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,555
Afraid not, I'm
shipping out this afternoon.

1203
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:06,061
Hey, boy, you looking
just a little bit too hard.

1204
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,233
My ass. You
better just, you know,

1205
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,356
take some of that glare
off your stare.

1206
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,650
Turn around to the left.
We have a little problem.

1207
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,731
It all right to
glance occasionally,

1208
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,738
but you staring like you want to go
up and jam your... Start fucking.

1209
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,239
Turn around.
Turn around.

1210
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:21,822
I'm keeping you out of some trouble.
Paint the fence.

1211
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:24,408
Banks! Get over here.

1212
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,538
I'll be right back.

1213
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:26,584
All right.

1214
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,752
Yeah?

1215
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,751
This is Stan Blocker, a scout
for the nigger leagues.

1216
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,207
Negro leagues, actually.

1217
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,587
Right.

1218
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,510
Pittsburgh Crawfords.
Ever hear of us?

1219
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,970
We get the games on
the radio sometimes.

1220
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,637
We played down
in Jackson yesterday,

1221
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,013
heard a rumor you got a boy up
here who can hit the ball a ton.

1222
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,471
You must mean
Can't Get Right.

1223
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,897
That's him,
right over there.

1224
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,145
<i>Get your ass
back here, boy.</i>

1225
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,193
"Can't Get Right"?
That's the kid's name?

1226
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,566
Yep.

1227
01:02:53,645 --> 01:02:54,897
Well, can I
talk to him?

1228
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,820
Well, you could try, but you won't get too far.
Why you interested?

1229
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,572
Crawfords are always
looking for new talent.

1230
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,327
Maybe you haven't noticed, Mr. Blocker,
but this here is a prison.

1231
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:12,213
There are ways around that.
Right, Sergeant?

1232
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,791
Oh. One never know.

1233
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,295
Nice-looking squad.

1234
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:27,224
Look at the way she glows.

1235
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,272
Oh, she is pretty,
isn't she?

1236
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,065
Thanks, Mom.

1237
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,611
And we're gonna have a baby.
Oh, my goodness.

1238
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,577
Can't Get Right, no, you can't do that.
No, don't... No!

1239
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,329
Can't Get Right,
no, you can't do that. No!

1240
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,707
Let's keep what mind you got
focused on the game.

1241
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,914
If you hit that ball
like I know you can hit it,

1242
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,045
you just might be our
ticket off this farm.

1243
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,422
Come on.
Think victory.

1244
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,675
The ball! Keep your... The ball!

1245
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,347
Eye on the ball. Down there.
The ball.

1246
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,726
Get up underneath that
motherfucker and do your thing!

1247
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,344
Put some of that
dumb-dumb strength on it!

1248
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,929
Come on do that thing now!
Come on, boy.

1249
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,138
Come on, boy.

1250
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,268
I'm right here
with you.

1251
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,435
We gonna knock that shit
right over the trees!

1252
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:15,810
Let's go!

1253
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,696
That's right. Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about!

1254
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:19,898
Oh, shit!

1255
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,867
Don't stand there! Run!

1256
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,445
Run!Go!
Just haul ass!

1257
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:26,654
Run, nigger, run!

1258
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,582
Oh, that's our ticket, baby.

1259
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,330
That's our ticket
off this farm.

1260
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,680
You mark my words.

1261
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:44,847
In five years,
there's gonna be

1262
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,641
a colored man
playing in the majors.

1263
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:47,842
You think?

1264
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,849
I don't think the world
will change that much.

1265
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,771
Maybe not yet,
but it will.

1266
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,974
I'll be out of a job.

1267
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,934
Damn, that's some
tasty hooch.

1268
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,735
It's amazing
what Ray here can do

1269
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,815
with a couple of pounds of
potato skins and some molasses.

1270
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,570
Tell me, Mr. Blocker, what
you think about our boy?

1271
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,276
You think
he got something?

1272
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:06,407
I think that boy could
be the next Josh Gibson.

1273
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,159
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

1274
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,490
Well, it's
getting late, boys.

1275
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,415
We got a game
in Memphis tomorrow.

1276
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,919
What about us? Don't
forget to mention us.

1277
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,121
Yeah, you know, 'cause we
kind of like his handlers.

1278
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:17,205
We take care of
everything for him.

1279
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,044
Yeah, I'll put in
a good word for you boys.

1280
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,091
All right. He can't
function without us.

1281
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,133
Okay.

1282
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,219
You've done a good job with that boy.
Thanks a lot.

1283
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,883
We hands-on with him,
you know.

1284
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,431
Okay. All right.

1285
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,679
Take care. Okay.
Have a nice day. Yeah.

1286
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:30,552
Walked off smooth
with my drink, didn't he?

1287
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:31,636
He sure did.

1288
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,141
I ain't gonna say nothing.
Have a good day!

1289
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,647
Take care now.

1290
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:35,769
Enjoy, man!
All right.

1291
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,601
Y'all come on over here!

1292
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,357
Y'all got something
to drink over there?

1293
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,939
Look what we got!
Some of your stuff, Ray!

1294
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,946
Can't Get Right,
this one's for you, baby!

1295
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,291
What in the world?

1296
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,624
What?

1297
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,463
Is Mae Rose all right?

1298
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,764
She's doing just fine.

1299
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,216
What about the baby?

1300
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,221
He's a big'un.

1301
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:18,066
"He"? It's a boy?
Honey, it's a boy!

1302
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,777
Yeah, buddy!

1303
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,980
Let me see that boy!
Where is that boy?

1304
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,569
Show me that grand-boy!

1305
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,202
Sergeant Dillard,
I want every man

1306
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:32,121
in this camp on
the line right now!

1307
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,325
Right now!
I mean right now!

1308
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,501
Bring them out here!
Let me see them!

1309
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,566
Ugh! Hope not.

1310
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,777
It was somebody
in this camp.

1311
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,826
I can feel it in my bones.

1312
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,121
Daddy, give me my baby back.

1313
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,302
What you laughing at, boy?
You laughing at me?

1314
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,350
You know who the daddy
of that chocolated baby is?

1315
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,811
Huh? You do?

1316
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,601
Well, who is it?
Speak up!

1317
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,066
It's my baby, boss.

1318
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,936
He's lying. I'm the father
of that baby, boss.

1319
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,780
Boss, I'm that
baby's daddy.

1320
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,317
Any fool can see
that baby belongs to me.

1321
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,154
I wanna differ. That little
rascal belong to me.

1322
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,282
Proud to say, boss,
I'm that baby's daddy.

1323
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,117
I be the pa, boss.

1324
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,873
I'm the pa of that
there young 'un, boss.

1325
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,708
I the pappy-

1326
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,363
<i>That was the
last we ever saw</i>

1327
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:37,073
<i>of Superintendent Abernathy
and little Mae Rose.</i>

1328
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:43,458
<i>To celebrate his departure, Camp 8
threw ourselves a little party.</i>

1329
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,380
<i>Ray provided the moonshine,</i>

1330
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,751
<i>and Claude managed to
scare up some girls.</i>

1331
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:53,509
<i>It wasn't quite the Boom-Boom
Room, but it was close enough.</i>

1332
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,266
Come on, now.

1333
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:01,813
Forget that, man. She don't
mean nothing to him.

1334
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,060
Don't pay that no mind.

1335
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,062
To hell with him.
It ain't that.

1336
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:09,900
What's your problem, sitting
around looking all sad and shit?

1337
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,320
It's almost all right
in here today. Almost.

1338
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,536
What's this?

1339
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,830
This is a release form. Man,
you getting out this month.

1340
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,382
What you sitting around
looking all sad for?

1341
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,334
What am I gonna
do out there, Ray?

1342
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,253
I can't go home
to my mama like this.

1343
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,259
Man, that shit you
talking is crazy.

1344
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,761
Your mama gonna be happy to
see you when you get home.

1345
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,434
But not like this, Ray.

1346
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:45,190
Hey, look. The world done changed a lot.
It's 1945, boy.

1347
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,354
Not for me,
it ain't.

1348
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:50,103
Look.

1349
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,443
You can't stay here.
That's for damn sure.

1350
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,525
I tell you what else, anybody
else in the whole place

1351
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,326
would give his right arm
to be in your shoes right now.

1352
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:58,615
I know I would.

1353
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:06,412
Shit. Fucking release papers,
sitting over here looking sad.

1354
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,046
<i>I ain't gonna sit here
with your ass looking all sad.</i>

1355
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,045
You got the best news of the day,
you sitting here looking sad.

1356
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,967
I'm gonna go over here
and slow grind with the sheep.

1357
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:15,632
You cheer up. You're
going home, all right?

1358
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,969
Hey, man, that's good news. Now, come on, now.
You're going home.

1359
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,216
You gonna
smile or something?

1360
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:21,972
There you go. All right, nigger.
I'll see you in a minute.

1361
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,336
Where you going, Biscuit?

1362
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,710
Oh!

1363
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,504
Where you going, boy?

1364
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,715
Don't do that!
Don't do it!

1365
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,047
Hold it right there!
Hold it!

1366
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,841
Biscuit!

1367
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,301
Man over the line!

1368
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,848
Hey! Hey!

1369
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:07,313
Hey, come on, now! Shit!

1370
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:31,250
Come on, J.
Come on, now.

1371
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:05,829
I got Chicago!

1372
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:08,829
Goldmouth,
I got Chicago!

1373
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,034
Yeah?

1374
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,710
Come on, fellas.

1375
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,004
Where you going?

1376
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,457
Why you all dressed up?

1377
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,675
What's this?

1378
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,132
What the fuck is going on?

1379
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,230
Blocker!
What's going on here?

1380
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:33,103
The kid's getting out.
I got him a pardon.

1381
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,061
What about me and Ray? I didn't
see our names on that pardon.

1382
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:38,362
You said you'd put
in a good word for us.

1383
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,984
I did.

1384
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:42,817
I mentioned you.
I mentioned both of you.

1385
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,949
But the fact is,
pardons don't come cheap.

1386
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:49,244
That kid can hit.
What can you guys do?

1387
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:54,379
We're the ones who worked with
him night and day on that game.

1388
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,172
Forget it, man.
Let it go.

1389
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,712
I'm not gonna let it go, Ray.
No, I'm not, okay?

1390
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,543
The man said he was gonna
put in a good word.

1391
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,378
Explain yourself.

1392
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,510
At least the kid's getting out.
That's what you wanted, right?

1393
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,319
Yeah. Of course.

1394
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,647
Okay.

1395
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,494
You show them Crawfords
how to play ball.

1396
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,537
Make them
throw you strikes.

1397
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,336
Go. You're a free man.

1398
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,010
It's all right.

1399
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,530
Come on, son.

1400
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:12,748
We love you, boy.

1401
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,661
Hit that ball, boy.

1402
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,371
You hit one out
the park for me.

1403
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,081
Gonna miss you,
Can't Get Right.

1404
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,171
Play hard, Can't Get Right!

1405
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,050
We'll catch you on the radio!

1406
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,135
All right.
So that's that.

1407
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,263
Look, one of the new boys
told me

1408
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:36,848
they're farming that land
up there by the swamp.

1409
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,057
He said he seen
a crop duster...

1410
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,813
I'm not in the mood
right now, Ray.

1411
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,189
They keep the crop duster
behind the barn.

1412
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,815
It can't be that hard
to fly a plane.

1413
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:43,987
Lots of people
do it, Claude.

1414
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,110
They're called pilots, Ray.

1415
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,532
I'm serious,
I'm not in the mood

1416
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,484
for one of your
fucked-up plans right now.

1417
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,695
I don't hear you coming up
with no plan, nigger!

1418
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:53,782
My plan is on his way
to Pittsburgh right now, Ray.

1419
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,159
Can't Get Right just
got himself a pardon

1420
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,119
signed by the governor,
thanks to us.

1421
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,330
But we can't seem to do
nothing for ourselves.

1422
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,836
Don't you feel a little
frustrated right now, Ray?

1423
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,758
Crop duster.

1424
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,636
I'm not getting in
no airplane with you.

1425
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:15,516
You know, I'm finally wrapping my
mind around this whole concept.

1426
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,479
Oh, really?
What concept is that?

1427
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:20,229
They threw us in this
shithole for life, Ray.

1428
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,934
Don't you get it?
We gonna die here.

1429
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,816
<i>We might as well
head up to the cemetery,</i>

1430
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,237
pick a plot,
and start digging.

1431
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:27,569
Now let me tell you something, my
daddy died in a place like this

1432
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,150
because of that
shit you're talking.

1433
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,530
He gave up hope
and hung hisself.

1434
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,282
I ain't going out
like that, Claude.

1435
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,284
Maybe you're
fooling yourself, Ray.

1436
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,536
Maybe you just
a chip off the old block.

1437
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,454
Now, you're gonna take that back,
or we ain't friends no more.

1438
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,381
News flash, Ray. We ain't
never been friends.

1439
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:47,131
We just been stuck
together for 12 years.

1440
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,586
It's been
nothing but pure hell

1441
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,797
since the moment I
ran into you, Ray.

1442
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:53,549
Every time I look at you,
I get sick to my stomach

1443
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:54,975
thinking what
my life could've been

1444
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,678
if I never, ever bumped
into Ray Gibson.

1445
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:57,853
All right,
you better slow down,

1446
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,396
'cause you fixing to say
something you gonna regret.

1447
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:00,894
You better
quiet down, nigger.

1448
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,943
Only thing I regret is
the day I met you, Ray.

1449
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:05,899
That's the way it is, huh?

1450
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,980
Yeah, that's
the way it is.

1451
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,491
I ain't got nothing else
to say to your ass then.

1452
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,576
Thank you!

1453
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:18,040
<i>Now if you ask me, when
Can't Get Right left Camp 8,</i>

1454
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,543
<i>a piece of Claude
left with him.</i>

1455
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,376
<i>And with Ray and Claude
not talking,</i>

1456
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:28,426
<i>the place felt a little
harder, a little colder.</i>

1457
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,363
<i>I have a dream.</i>

1458
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:01,412
<i>...be the greatest!
I'm the king of the world.</i>

1459
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:18,472
<i>And it is time for you and me
to fight for ourselves.</i>

1460
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,699
I'll see y'all
in New York City!

1461
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:35,780
Oh, shit!

1462
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:30,790
<i>Round about 1972,</i>

1463
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,217
<i>I got transferred
to the infirmary,</i>

1464
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:36,261
<i>and those two fools
were still at it.</i>

1465
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:43,219
<i>But no matter
how tough a man is,</i>

1466
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:45,729
<i>he spends enough
time on this farm,</i>

1467
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:48,023
<i>he'll find
his breaking point.</i>

1468
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:51,148
<i>It could be triggered
by any little thing.</i>

1469
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:55,815
<i>A face. A voice.
Even a smell.</i>

1470
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,458
White-only pies.

1471
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,920
Man over the line!

1472
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,352
That boy went crazy.

1473
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,613
You comfortable?

1474
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:40,735
As a pair of
fur-lined bedroom slippers.

1475
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:45,832
That's very amusing. We'll
see how them slippers feel

1476
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:49,001
after, let's say,
about 24 hours.

1477
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:52,830
I need a volunteer!

1478
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,750
Gibson, stand up.

1479
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,215
I'll make you
trustee right now.

1480
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:02,014
If that pie-eating son of a
bitch step off them bottles,

1481
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,308
<i>if so much as
one toe hit that dirt,</i>

1482
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,181
I want you to shoot him
right in his ass.

1483
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:10,939
I want you to kill him.
I want you to shoot him dead.

1484
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:14,018
You do that, I swear to
God, you're a free man.

1485
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:16,900
Hell, I'll walk you
out the gate myself.

1486
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,981
What do you say?

1487
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:25,951
I got to be
honest with you, boss.

1488
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:28,039
You don't wanna
give me that gun,

1489
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,083
'cause I'd probably
shoot you with it.

1490
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,505
That was
the wrong answer, boy.

1491
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,751
You a fool.
I'd have taken that deal.

1492
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:42,421
I beg your pardon?
You say something to me?

1493
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,845
I'd have knocked you off the
bottles, put a bullet in your ass,

1494
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:48,268
and be halfway to
New York right now.

1495
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:53,517
Well, my goodness. After all
these years of blissful silence,

1496
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:56,773
I forgot how annoying
the sound of your voice is.

1497
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,521
Ray, I hope you don't think
I owe you anything,

1498
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:01,573
'cause I don't owe you
a damn thing.

1499
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:04,071
I ain't do nothing for
you to owe me nothing.

1500
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:06,950
What you got I ain't got?
I did it for me.

1501
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:10,784
I'm a man, God damn it. I ain't no
motherfucking, bootlicking trustee.

1502
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,123
<i>You gonna make me fall off this
shit, talking to your ass.</i>

1503
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:16,414
It's about being poised, Ray.
Just poise yourself.

1504
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:17,999
Poise, my ass.

1505
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,177
Look here, Ray,

1506
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,802
I'm sorry to hear
about your mama passing.

1507
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,806
Yeah, that was
about five years ago.

1508
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,185
Thank you.

1509
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:34,189
I know, but since we're talking,
I thought I'd mention it.

1510
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:37,731
We not talking, you talking. And
doing a little bit too much of it.

1511
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,279
Every time you start talking,
I almost fall...

1512
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,526
Would you stop...

1513
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:42,857
Don't say nothing
else to me!

1514
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,608
You about to
make me fall, Ray.

1515
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,318
Hold still and
don't say nothing.

1516
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:50,989
Oh!

1517
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,033
Damn, one of my toes
in the bottle.

1518
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:54,869
Damn it, Ray, shit.

1519
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:07,010
What you laughing about, Ray?
What's so funny?

1520
01:22:08,715 --> 01:22:10,308
Thinking about you
running with them bullets

1521
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:11,852
flying all over
the top of your head.

1522
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,520
That's something
to see there.

1523
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:14,972
That was
a sight to see, nigger.

1524
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:17,183
Bullets weren't
the problem, Ray.

1525
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,064
That pie was too hot.

1526
01:22:19,393 --> 01:22:21,441
Burned my damn tongue.

1527
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:27,867
It sure is good
talking to you again.

1528
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:31,530
Good talking
to you, too.

1529
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:34,958
Come on! Let's move!

1530
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:38,037
We got 14 acres of land to clear today!
Let's go!

1531
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,833
<i>Gibson, Banks, get your
sorry asses over here.</i>

1532
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,382
Every morning I
wake up praying

1533
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:51,218
that Ray Gibson and Claude Banks
have died in their sleep.

1534
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,644
And every morning
you disappoint me.

1535
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,722
Sorry, boss.
Sorry, boss.

1536
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:00,477
You two got 15 minutes
to clear out your lockers.

1537
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:03,028
The both of you
have been transferred

1538
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,571
to the superintendent's
mansion.

1539
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,074
And I, for one,
won't miss you.

1540
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:20,913
Here's your medicine,
Mr. Wilkins.

1541
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:23,416
My pills.
Thank you, Claude.

1542
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,167
Oh, you're welcome.

1543
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,644
Oh, yard boy.

1544
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:39,523
This myrtle could
use some attention.

1545
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:42,943
Perhaps some fertilizer
would restore its exuberance.

1546
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,280
Get your ass to work.

1547
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,859
Claude.

1548
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,071
Tell me what you
think of this place.

1549
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:58,121
It's one of these new
retirement communities

1550
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,328
they built
down on the Gulf.

1551
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:04,541
I figure I ought to try to enjoy
myself what few years I got left.

1552
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,677
Let's take a look at this.

1553
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:13,724
Eyesight ain't what it once was.
Oh, this is nice here.

1554
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:18,020
"Ocean views, palm trees.

1555
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,806
"Two heated swimming pools."

1556
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,440
Sounds a damn sight better than
that infirmary across the way

1557
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:28,398
where I'm gonna end up,
I'll tell you that.

1558
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:34,156
Claude.

1559
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:39,583
I must apologize, Claude.
That was rude of me.

1560
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,285
That's all right, boss.

1561
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:44,212
Takes more than some colorful
brochure to hurt my feelings.

1562
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,672
You've been on the farm for
quite a spell, haven't you?

1563
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:53,506
Over 40 years now. Me and
Ray Gibson out there.

1564
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,348
Forty years.

1565
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:59,099
That's a long time for
any crime, even murder.

1566
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:02,598
It's a hell of a lot longer
when you're innocent.

1567
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:07,737
Half the men in this prison
swear they're innocent, Claude.

1568
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:11,023
Don't you think
that's kind of funny?

1569
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:14,155
You have to forgive
me if I don't laugh.

1570
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:16,620
Excuse me.

1571
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,881
What you looking at, Ray?

1572
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,218
Just what the fuck
you looking at, Ray?

1573
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,299
I noticed that...

1574
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:41,387
I noticed you and Mr. Wilkins
been mighty friendly lately.

1575
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,892
Y'all wanna be a new
couple or something?

1576
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,645
Kiss my ass, Ray. Okay?

1577
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,985
Mr. Wilkins just an old
man that like to talk.

1578
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,735
That's all that is, Ray.
That's all that is.

1579
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:55,575
Y'all like to talk. I'm lonely,
and I like to talk, too.

1580
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:59,281
What you wanna talk about, Ray? Huh?
What you wanna talk about?

1581
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:02,036
Nigger, I wanna talk about the
plan you've been working on.

1582
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:04,243
I ain't working
on no plan, Ray!

1583
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,294
I know you.

1584
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:09,169
And I know when you got
something brewing. I know it!

1585
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:12,338
What I got brewing, Ray?

1586
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,589
You tell me!

1587
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:15,888
You done lost
your damn mind, Ray.

1588
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:18,511
I don't care
what you believe.

1589
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,842
I don't care what
you believe

1590
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:21,222
'cause I know you got
something up your sleeve.

1591
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:23,429
Think I'm gonna stay up
arguing with you all night?

1592
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:27,142
You cutting into my sleeping time, okay?
Kiss my ass and good night.

1593
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:29,814
Go to sleep, nigger.
I hope it's the long one.

1594
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:32,029
Why you talking instead of sleeping?
Good night.

1595
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:34,357
I'm going to sleep.
Why don't you go to sleep?

1596
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:37,613
Why can't I just sit here
and look at your ass?

1597
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:40,196
And wonder what you
got up your sleeve.

1598
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:41,495
I got something brewing.

1599
01:26:41,613 --> 01:26:43,331
I got an ass-whupping
brewing for you, Ray,

1600
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:44,875
if you don't stop
fucking with me.

1601
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,543
Is that right?
That's right, Ray.

1602
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,165
All right.
Sleep tight, nigger.

1603
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:50,122
Fuck you.
Yeah, fuck you, too.

1604
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,835
I hope your ass piss the bed with
that weak-ass bladder of yours.

1605
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:57,714
If I do, then I'll put the sheets on you.
How you like that?

1606
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,519
Now just where the hell
you think you going?

1607
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:11,272
Mr. Wilkins' driver
got the flu,

1608
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,604
and he asked me
to fill in for him.

1609
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,531
How the hell you gonna fill in for somebody?
You can't drive.

1610
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:19,447
You ain't got no driver license,
you ain't drove in 40 years.

1611
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:21,904
He know he's taking his life in
his own hands, letting you drive?

1612
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,034
Shut up, Ray.

1613
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:24,080
I'm not gonna shut up.

1614
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:25,783
Where the hell you
supposed to be going?

1615
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,914
If you must know...
Then I must know.

1616
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,336
I got to know, nigger.
What's up?

1617
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:33,336
Greenville. Pick up the new
superintendent at the bus station.

1618
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:35,084
What's with
the old pretty suit?

1619
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,419
Who you supposed to be,
Harry Belafonte?

1620
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,630
I look very dapper,
very debonair, don't I?

1621
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,048
Now don't touch this car.

1622
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:45,386
I piss on the motherfucker. Ain't
gonna touch it, I'll piss on it.

1623
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,221
Why you got to
say nasty shit, Ray?

1624
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,477
'Cause I'm
a nasty motherfucker.

1625
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:18,297
You know I
trust you, Claude.

1626
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:19,502
I hope so.

1627
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:20,963
Be right back.

1628
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:16,105
What the fuck?

1629
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:58,314
Naturally, I had to get set down next
to your proverbial hypochondriac,

1630
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,397
middle-aged fat lady with a
goddamn wart on her nose,

1631
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:04,107
hair growing out of it,
for Christ's sakes.

1632
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,817
<i>I tell you, I got to know</i>

1633
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:08,199
<i>her goddamn gallbladder</i>

1634
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,664
<i>like the back of
my goddamn hand.</i>

1635
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:16,036
Claude?
Mr. Pike, Claude.

1636
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,419
There you go, boy.

1637
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,175
Come on, Claude.
It's time to go.

1638
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,675
Let me get that door for you.
You just stretch out.

1639
01:30:28,006 --> 01:30:29,758
Now you're sure
it was him.

1640
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,219
Some faces you
just don't forget.

1641
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,596
Warren Pike is
one of them.

1642
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:34,679
All right.

1643
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,603
Got a bird!

1644
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,285
That's quite a haul,
huh, Claude?

1645
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:54,074
What do you say, Mr. Pike? You
about ready to call it a day?

1646
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,502
Yeah, it's getting late,

1647
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:01,206
and I sure as hell could
use a nice, hot bath.

1648
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:05,010
That's a mighty fine timepiece
you got there, Mr. Pike.

1649
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:06,678
Even play
a fancy tune, huh?

1650
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:07,970
Yeah, it's special.

1651
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:09,719
They don't make
them like that anymore.

1652
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,554
I'll bet they don't.

1653
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:15,512
You wouldn't mind if I asked you
where you got that from, would you?

1654
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:21,317
My wife gave it to me on our
anniversary some years back.

1655
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:24,320
Uh-huh.

1656
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,114
About 40 years back?

1657
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:33,242
Forty years.
Yeah, something like that.

1658
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,207
She give you that
scar on your face, too?

1659
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:38,626
I ought to kill you
for that remark, boy.

1660
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,495
What's going on here?

1661
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:43,840
I think I might just have
to teach this uppity nigger

1662
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:45,925
a lesson in manners.

1663
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:50,551
Ray, be cool. You gonna get
us in a lot of trouble now.

1664
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,098
He's right, Gibson.

1665
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,801
You put that gun down, or I'm
gonna have to shoot you.

1666
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:57,354
Then we about to be
some shot-up motherfuckers.

1667
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,397
Now, wait a minute.
Don't nobody shoot nobody.

1668
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:02,146
Ray, I wanna see this son of
a bitch dead just like you.

1669
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:04,273
I don't wanna see
you go down with him.

1670
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:06,696
Ray, give me the gun. Come on, now.
Give me the gun.

1671
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:09,445
Claude, he got my daddy's watch!
He killed Winston Hancock!

1672
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,572
Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
He's crazy.

1673
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:12,777
Gibson,
I want you to stop now.

1674
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:13,908
Think about
what you're saying.

1675
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:15,284
I know just
what I'm saying!

1676
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,206
That's the only thing my daddy
ever give me, and he's got it.

1677
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:18,283
Tell them what you did.

1678
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,539
Is there any truth in
what this man is saying?

1679
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:22,586
What the hell
difference does it make?

1680
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:24,539
At least the state
of Mississippi got

1681
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,670
40 years of cheap labor
out of the deal.

1682
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,464
Motherfucker, you done took
our lives away from us.

1683
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,544
Give me the gun, Ray.

1684
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,220
I'm gonna kill this
motherfucker myself.

1685
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:32,513
No!

1686
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:34,303
Put it down, Pike!

1687
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:57,747
I believe
this belongs to me.

1688
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:13,009
My daddy's watch.

1689
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:19,937
We were walking back. A bird
came out low on our left.

1690
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,513
I swung on it.

1691
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:25,024
Mr. Pike walked directly
in my line of fire.

1692
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,979
Where were the two convicts
when the shot was fired?

1693
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:31,281
They were loading up
the truck, I believe.

1694
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:32,608
They'd gone on ahead.

1695
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,909
Why don't he just
tell him the truth?

1696
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:36,528
He know nobody
wanna hear the truth.

1697
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,079
He gonna tell them
what they wanna hear.

1698
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,448
I don't know, Ray.

1699
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:40,703
We'll talk, okay?

1700
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:41,783
Thank you.

1701
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,457
Here he comes.

1702
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:52,469
I think they bought it.

1703
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:55,388
One of the deputies
is a member of my church.

1704
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:59,635
Gibson, I don't think
there's any way that

1705
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,313
I could...

1706
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,312
Claude...

1707
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:11,067
There's no way to
make up for 40 years.

1708
01:34:13,773 --> 01:34:15,650
I'll get Charlie

1709
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:19,075
to draw up your pardon papers
in the morning.

1710
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:24,034
Would you mind
helping me upstairs?

1711
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:25,243
<i>Sure, boss.</i>

1712
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:27,249
I'm not your boss.

1713
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,081
I'm not your boss.
Not anymore.

1714
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,386
So Ray and Claude
get their pardons, right?

1715
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:37,680
No, ain't get
their pardons, man.

1716
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,507
If they got their
pardons way back then,

1717
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:42,310
we wouldn't be burying
them here today, would we?

1718
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,103
That's right.
Damn.

1719
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:47,183
What happened is
Old Man Wilkins

1720
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,518
never come out
of the bathroom.

1721
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:52,775
Sat right there and
died on the shitter.

1722
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,909
That must've been pretty
messed up for them, man.

1723
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:01,197
What happened to them
after that, old-timer?

1724
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:04,620
Let's see.
What happened after that?

1725
01:35:05,116 --> 01:35:06,368
Oh, yeah!

1726
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:08,294
They got old.

1727
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:14,384
Shit. We all got old.

1728
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:18,300
<i>And getting out took on
a whole new meaning.</i>

1729
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,804
Looks like Jonesy
got his walking papers.

1730
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:23,681
Yeah, there he go.

1731
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:27,147
Over to the morgue,
up the hill to the cemetery.

1732
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:32,478
Phew! I'll tell you what, Claude, you
were right when you said what you said.

1733
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,313
You said we wasn't never
gonna get out of this place.

1734
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:36,989
And you were right.

1735
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:39,784
You said the only way
we gonna get outta here

1736
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:42,112
is through
the morgue and the cemetery.

1737
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:44,869
And you're right,
'cause we right here.

1738
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:46,867
Right here, right now.

1739
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:49,164
Yeah, I remember
saying that.

1740
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:53,006
We next.
Let's be real.

1741
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:57,086
We next. You like baseball?
We on deck.

1742
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:58,340
On deck for what?

1743
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:00,171
For what?
That upper room, nigger.

1744
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:03,008
<i>The upper room</i>

1745
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:06,721
<i>When Jesus...</i>

1746
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,431
Know where that is,
the upper room

1747
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:10,936
the motherfuckers
be singing about?

1748
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:12,267
<i>The upper room</i>

1749
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,818
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

1750
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:16,863
You die first, I'm gonna
sing at your funeral.

1751
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:19,407
I'm gonna just bust up
in the motherfucker and go...

1752
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,530
<i>The upper room</i>

1753
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,577
Let them shoot me.
I don't give a fuck

1754
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:25,405
if they take me out
singing that motherfucker.

1755
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,081
You crazy, Ray.

1756
01:36:27,156 --> 01:36:28,908
Hell, yeah.

1757
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:32,708
Friend.

1758
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,841
Yeah. We next.

1759
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:43,174
I wanna be at the game.
I'm on a roll.

1760
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:45,384
<i>Mama and my
daddy don't know how</i>

1761
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:48,686
Two Percodan, baby. There you go.
Give me what you got.

1762
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:50,263
I'll raise you.

1763
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,558
Yo, what the fuck are those?

1764
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:56,520
It helps keep
the cholesterol down.

1765
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,479
Old man, do I look
like I give a damn

1766
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:00,486
about my cholesterol
right now?

1767
01:37:01,190 --> 01:37:02,407
Come on, now.

1768
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,073
You want a bump, G?

1769
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:10,079
No, I don't want
none of that shit.

1770
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:11,288
That's right.

1771
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:12,835
I wouldn't put that
in my nose if I were you.

1772
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,332
You know how they get
it in here, don't you?

1773
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:15,584
Tell him how
they get in here.

1774
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,665
People smuggle it in,
in their ass.

1775
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:19,258
Say What?

1776
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:22,008
I know the motherfucker
that bring it in here.

1777
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:24,930
That come out of somebody's
asshole, so go on, enjoy.

1778
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,007
Whatever.

1779
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,091
I know if I got to
get high,

1780
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:29,769
I got to smell some shit,
I ain't gonna have none.

1781
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:31,312
That ain't high.
That's low.

1782
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:36,193
That cocaine, heroin, marijuana, all
that shit, bring it all in here,

1783
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:38,315
in their ass.
That's right.

1784
01:37:38,436 --> 01:37:40,188
Look like it's up
to you, ass-sniffer.

1785
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:44,818
Okay, boys, come and get it!
Jell-O!

1786
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:47,945
Jell-O pudding!

1787
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:49,121
Play one more hand.

1788
01:37:49,197 --> 01:37:51,120
I'm gonna get my Jell-O.
Come on.

1789
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,418
Y'all gonna take all my
money and go run off

1790
01:37:53,493 --> 01:37:55,120
'cause nurse said, "Jell-O."

1791
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:56,830
Ray. I don't want no
Jell-O, God damn it.

1792
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:59,048
No, I ain't said
nothing about the Jell-O.

1793
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:02,297
I was thinking about what we
talked about this afternoon.

1794
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:03,674
I think I got a plan.

1795
01:38:03,753 --> 01:38:04,754
You got a plan?

1796
01:38:04,837 --> 01:38:05,963
Yeah.

1797
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:08,216
I'm a visionary
on this one.

1798
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:09,551
You got it all
worked out, huh?

1799
01:38:09,634 --> 01:38:10,851
I think I really do.

1800
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:12,891
Listen here.
Any plan you got

1801
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,769
I don't even wanna hear
'cause I know it's fucked up.

1802
01:38:15,848 --> 01:38:17,350
All fucked up.

1803
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:20,399
If you don't wanna believe me, you
don't wanna believe me then, Ray.

1804
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:23,948
I'm too old. I ain't got time for no plan.
I'm 90 years old, Claude.

1805
01:38:24,023 --> 01:38:25,775
I never thought
I'd see the day

1806
01:38:25,858 --> 01:38:27,576
that old Ray Gibson
give up hope.

1807
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,370
Never thought...
Say what now?

1808
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:32,616
I said I never thought
I'd hear the day

1809
01:38:32,698 --> 01:38:34,666
that old Ray Gibson
give up hope.

1810
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,915
Nigger, I ain't given up
no motherfucking hope.

1811
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:40,214
I'm keeping it real, like them
niggers in here keep it real.

1812
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,503
Ain't nobody
give up nothing.

1813
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:42,708
But you know what?

1814
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:44,177
You'd probably
slow me down anyway.

1815
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:45,549
Said which?

1816
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:46,922
You'd only
slow me down.

1817
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:49,678
<i>You must be high if you think I'm
gonna slow your slow ass down.</i>

1818
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,134
I got a plan.

1819
01:38:51,217 --> 01:38:53,936
I tell you what.
Fuck your plan.

1820
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:57,231
Come on, Lou. Cover that up. Don't
nobody wanna see that shit.

1821
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,691
Put your drawers
on or something.

1822
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,484
Lou, cover it up.

1823
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,233
Don't touch it.
Put your hand away.

1824
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:06,324
That turn my stomach. I don't want no
Jell-O after I seen them old-ass balls.

1825
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:09,699
Who gonna enjoy Jell-O
after I seen what I've seen?

1826
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,948
I don't even want Jell-O.
Lou ruin my stomach.

1827
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:31,799
Anybody seen Claude?

1828
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:37,806
I been sitting here the whole time.
He ain't come out.

1829
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:39,106
Claude ain't out!

1830
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:40,729
Claude has died, God!

1831
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:45,442
No, Ray, don't go!

1832
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,276
Claude!

1833
01:39:50,359 --> 01:39:51,576
Ray, you can't
go in there!

1834
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:53,620
Ray, come back!
Claude!

1835
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:57,909
Claude!

1836
01:40:10,588 --> 01:40:11,840
How did it start?

1837
01:40:11,923 --> 01:40:13,175
Probably old wires.

1838
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:17,011
Place was a tinderbox
just waiting to go.

1839
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:21,600
I guess we should've torn this old
building down a long time ago.

1840
01:40:21,933 --> 01:40:25,813
Gibson made it this far before he
was probably overcome by smoke.

1841
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:29,532
From the looks of things, Banks
didn't even make it out of bed.

1842
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,280
You really
bummed me out.

1843
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,825
That's a terrible story.

1844
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:42,495
Nigger. you crying?

1845
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,624
No, I got allergies.
I'm cool.

1846
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,508
Oh, my God, man.

1847
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:51,925
Ain't nothing wrong with a man
crying every now and again.

1848
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:55,178
Listen, man. What was
Claude's plan, anyway?

1849
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:57,434
Claude figured

1850
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:00,480
he could steal a couple of
bodies from the morgue, right?

1851
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:03,308
That way, when he set
the infirmary on fire,

1852
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:06,270
in all the commotion,
him and Ray could just

1853
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:08,696
slip right onto
them fire engines, see?

1854
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:10,941
Hide out,
wait until the morning,

1855
01:41:11,023 --> 01:41:13,492
and roll right on
out with them, you see?

1856
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:17,872
That way, when they find the two
bodies, they think it was them.

1857
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:20,333
What makes you
think that ain't work?

1858
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:21,583
Mmm.

1859
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:25,706
I never said
it didn't work.

1860
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,587
Wait. You mean to
tell me that this is

1861
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:31,886
not Ray and Claude
in these two boxes?

1862
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:36,090
Is it, old man?

1863
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:39,927
Hey, old-timer, is it?

1864
01:41:56,944 --> 01:41:58,412
I like that.
See?

1865
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:01,328
You feel part of this
baseball game, don't you?

1866
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:03,375
They only get one
out of me today.

1867
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:07,001
Now, we were arguing
about something, okay?

1868
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:10,379
I didn't appreciate when you
said something about...

1869
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:13,090
You had just said
I was...

1870
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:15,925
You said that...

1871
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:19,057
You know what?
Hell with it.

1872
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,056
It's a hell of a day
for a ball game.

1873
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:22,512
Yankees on fire.

1874
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:24,063
Motherfuckers kicking ass.

1875
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:26,357
Which ones the Yankees?

1876
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,067
Well, the ones up
at the mound.

1877
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,109
Go, go, you! Run!

1878
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:34,690
That's the Yankees
right there.

1879
01:42:34,774 --> 01:42:35,991
Which ones there?

1880
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:37,535
That's the Yankees
right there.

1881
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:39,533
It's a perfect plan.
We're out.

1882
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:42,491
What's so perfect? Took 65
years to come up with it.

1883
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:44,575
Why can't you
just say thank you?

1884
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:47,333
<i>You want me to say thank you?
You can kiss my ass, too.</i>

1885
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:52,792
I'm ready to go
back right now.

1886
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:55,173
Then let's go, Ray.

1887
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:56,253
Hold my frank.

1888
01:42:58,255 --> 01:42:59,472
Come on.
Help a nigger out, man.

1889
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:00,842
Don't make me
stand out in this cold.

1890
01:43:00,925 --> 01:43:03,599
Your bitch would be
standing... I'm sorry.

1891
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:07,435
You fuck around with me, it's gonna
be consequences and repercussions.

1892
01:43:07,515 --> 01:43:09,313
What's repercussions?
Uh-oh.

1893
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,203
Let me get that.

1894
01:43:21,821 --> 01:43:24,370
Yeah, I know it's 1932.

1895
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:26,746
I'm the first one
to have this.

1896
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:31,505
Hey, mud head. Hey, watch... Shit.
I almost got stung by a bee.

1897
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:35,918
You were scared, huh?
Don't be scared.

1898
01:43:36,961 --> 01:43:40,010
Uh-uh. Don't be scared, and don't laugh either.
'Cause it ain't funny.

1899
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:43,555
That boy got
God-given talent.

1900
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:45,345
God made his...

1901
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:49,398
What's wrong?
The mustache too big?

1902
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:55,230
He give up hope
and hung himself

1903
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:57,314
because of the airplane
that's coming over.

1904
01:43:57,398 --> 01:44:00,402
Make me have to loop all this shit.
I ain't looping shit!

1905
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:02,236
We either get it now,
or not at all!

1906
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:04,572
My name Jangle Leg,
Jangle Leg.

1907
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:09,577
You think that's funny?

1908
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:14,836
That's probably the last time.
Sorry.

1909
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:16,258
My bad.

1910
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:20,338
This ain't my daddy's watch.

1910
01:44:21,305 --> 01:44:27,330
