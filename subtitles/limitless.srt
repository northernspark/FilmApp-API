00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:57,765
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>I miscalculated a few things.</i>

3
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,778
Eddie! I know you're in there!

4
00:01:14,523 --> 00:01:17,981
<i>Why is it that the moment your life</i>
<i>exceeds your wildest dreams...</i>

5
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,618
<i>The access code you have entered...</i>

6
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:21,993
<i>the knife appears at your back?</i>

7
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:25,363
<i>The access code</i>
<i>you have entered is invalid...</i>

8
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:28,870
<i>Well, I'll tell you one thing...</i>

9
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,460
<i>I will never let them touch me.</i>

10
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:09,205
<i>My neighbor, who must have</i>
<i>opened his door to complain.</i>

11
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:12,770
You're gonna be next, Eddie!
We're coming in!

12
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:18,619
<i>For a guy with a four digit IQ,</i>
<i>I must have missed something.</i>

13
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,587
<i>And I hadn't missed much.</i>

14
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,515
<i>I'd come this close to having</i>
<i>an impact on the world.</i>

15
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:28,454
<i>And now, the only thing</i>
<i>I'd have an impact on...</i>

16
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:31,258
<i>... was the sidewalk.</i>

17
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:54,944
<i>You see that guy?</i>

18
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:56,985
<i>That was me, not so long ago.</i>

19
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,980
<i>What kind of guy without a drug or</i>
<i>alcohol problem looks this way?</i>

20
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,816
<i>Only a writer. Strangely enough,</i>

21
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:06,554
<i>nobody believed that</i>
<i>I actually had a book contract.</i>

22
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:08,357
Well, it's masquerading
as a sci-fi novel,

23
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,125
but it's really, uh,
my own personal manifesto

24
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,133
about the plight of the
individual in the 21 st century.

25
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,431
I sort of created a utopian society

26
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,733
where we all sort of...
Uh... Uh...

27
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:19,535
It's really... it's really...

28
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:24,301
Uh...

29
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:29,776
<i>Today was the day</i>
<i>I was gonna kick its ass.</i>

30
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,877
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Here we go. Here we go...</i>

31
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:36,052
<i>It was gonna be great.</i>

32
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:39,322
<i>Just gotta put in the time.</i>
<i>Stay in the room.</i>

33
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:42,126
<i>That's the key concept.</i>

34
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:44,798
<i>Don't leave the room.</i>

35
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,676
<i>A few weeks passed this way.</i>

36
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,082
<i>Maybe a few months.</i>

37
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,219
<i>At least I still had Lindy.</i>

38
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:09,054
Just like that?

39
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,499
Come on, Eddie.
This is hardly a surprise.

40
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:17,038
I'm surprised.

41
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,308
Let's just not do this, OK?
Let me...

42
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,071
I'm gonna hand in
90 pages to Marla on Friday.

43
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:23,634
If you just wait to see
what she says...

44
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:24,907
Eddie.

45
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:27,211
- What?
- I know how it's going.

46
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:29,042
I'm your...

47
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:32,080
I was your girlfriend.

48
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:35,588
That word doesn't even begin
to describe what you are to me.

49
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:39,059
Partner? Squeeze?

50
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:42,029
Paramour. Inamorata.

51
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:45,295
Cleaning lady. Bank.

52
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:48,766
Thanks. Be right back.

53
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:50,237
Be that a...

54
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:52,638
What's mine is yours, too,

55
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,108
and you know I want to share
the rest of my life with you.

56
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:57,338
- I was thinking that we should...
- Don't propose.

57
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,269
Why not?

58
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:03,410
Because it worked out
so well for you last time.

59
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:06,614
<i>It's true, I did marry once.</i>
<i>Right out of college, to Melissa.</i>

60
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,917
I do.

61
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,979
<i>Briefly.</i>

62
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:11,254
This isn't working.

63
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:18,616
Well, even though everything you
say is true, I still love you.

64
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,493
I gotta get back to work.

65
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,697
You didn't even
tell me what happened.

66
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:33,127
- I got it.
- You did?

67
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:35,499
Mm-hm. I'm an editor.

68
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,004
I'll have my own assistant.
Can you believe that?

69
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,705
Yeah, of course I believe it.
You deserve it.

70
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:44,236
Thanks.

71
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,780
- OK.
- OK.

72
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:58,454
<i>She was right. Why stick it out?</i>

73
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,387
<i>I had clearly missed the on-ramp.</i>

74
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:03,894
<i>We both knew what was beckoning.</i>

75
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,230
<i>The lower bunk in my</i>
<i>childhood bedroom in Jersey.</i>

76
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,895
<i>My father happy to welcome me</i>
<i>into the challenging field</i>

77
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,030
<i>of dental supply inventory.</i>

78
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:13,867
Eddie Morra.

79
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,241
<i>Of all the useless</i>
<i>relationships better forgotten</i>

80
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,836
<i>and put away in mothballs,</i>

81
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:22,883
<i>is there any more useless than...</i>
<i>the ex-brother-in-law?</i>

82
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,248
Holy shit, man.

83
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,253
What has it been? Like nine years?

84
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,549
- God!
- Hey.

85
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:32,252
You all right? You look like
you're living on the streets.

86
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,315
What's going on?

87
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:36,526
Not much, I... Well...
What am I... What's up?

88
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:38,690
Uh, I'm writing. Writing a lot.

89
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,393
Oh, you're still trying to write?

90
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:42,692
Matter of fact,
I have a book contract.

91
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:44,598
- Really?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,162
- That's great.
- How about you?

93
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,673
Are you still dealing, Vern?

94
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:51,041
- Do I look like I'm still dealing?
- No, you don't. No.

95
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,377
Come on, let's go get a drink.
I want to hear about this book.

96
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:56,378
I don't know.
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

97
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:59,920
When has that ever stopped you?

98
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:04,748
- So.
- So...

99
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:06,487
How's Melissa doing?

100
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,222
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

101
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:12,460
Wouldn't know. I don't see her.
She moved upstate.

102
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:17,095
She got some kind of Internet home sales
kind of job. Couple kids.

103
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:20,140
Couple kids. Who's the husband?

104
00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:24,737
He walked out on her,
if you really want to know.

105
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:26,245
But what do you care, man?

106
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,516
You were married, like, five minutes.

107
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:32,519
Look, I don't wanna talk about her.
I wanna talk about you, OK?

108
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:35,385
Tell me about this book.
How's it going?

109
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,621
Well, it's, uh...

110
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:40,092
I'm... I'm...

111
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,026
I'm behind.
I'm behind on my book.

112
00:08:43,097 --> 00:08:45,463
And, uh, it's pretty well
polluting my days and nights,

113
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,364
if you really want to know.

114
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:50,893
- Well, how much have you written of it?
- Not one word.

115
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:54,408
- Creative problems, huh?
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

116
00:08:57,311 --> 00:09:00,280
Well, I suppose
I can help you with that.

117
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:02,043
Just this once.

118
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:04,713
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

119
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:08,277
- You don't even know what it is.
- You're still dealing.

120
00:09:08,356 --> 00:09:10,950
Brother,
I am light years from that now.

121
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:15,155
I've been doing, uh, some consulting
for a pharmaceutical company.

122
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,993
What, like some offshore lab
making fake Viagra? Come on, Vern.

123
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:22,934
No. This is an exclusive product
that's coming on stream next year.

124
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:25,871
They've had clinical trials
and it's FDA approved.

125
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:28,869
All right, just out of curiosity
and that's all...

126
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,210
Let's see it.

127
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:36,340
What's in it?

128
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,281
They've identified these receptors
in the brain

129
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:42,151
that activate specific circuits.

130
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:45,886
And you how they say that we can
only access 20 percent of our brain?

131
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:51,055
Well, what this does...
it lets you access all of it.

132
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:55,733
Vern, look at me. Do I look good to you?
I'm broke and I'm depressed off my ass.

133
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,328
I don't think that my life's
gonna take some sudden upswing

134
00:09:58,406 --> 00:10:00,636
into fame and fortune by taking some
shiny, brand-new designer drug.

135
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,733
Gant.

136
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,842
When?

137
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:08,939
Tell him we can't do that.
No, you tell him.

138
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,012
No, now.

139
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:17,255
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to leave you here, Eddie.

140
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,987
But I really... I really do
want to do this again.

141
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:23,360
So, call me.
And, uh, that's on the house.

142
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:25,664
I don't want it.

143
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,963
Don't be ungrateful.
You know how much that costs?

144
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:31,664
Eight hundred bucks. A pop.

145
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,929
You're welcome.

146
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:47,512
<i>All the way home,</i>
<i>I thought about Melissa.</i>

147
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:50,917
<i>How could she be a failure, too?</i>
<i>She'd been so smart.</i>

148
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,886
<i>Smarter than anyone around her.</i></i>

149
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:57,362
<i>Clearly, there was a direct link</i>
<i>between this Eddie,</i>

150
00:10:57,431 --> 00:11:00,525
<i>slightly drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon,</i>
<i>and an earlier Eddie...</i>

151
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:04,638
<i>... vomiting on his boss's desk</i>
<i>or stealing his dying aunt's Percocet.</i>

152
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,400
<i>So who could blame Lindy</i>
<i>for dumping me?</i>

153
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:20,866
<i>In the end, how much worse could it get?</i>

154
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:31,237
<i>I didn't want to see anybody.</i>

155
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:34,181
<i>Especially not my landlord's</i>
<i>nasty young wife.</i>

156
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,582
- Valerie, Tuesday.
- Look. Enough, OK?

157
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,951
Steve handles the rent,
so you can feed your crap to him.

158
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:40,956
<i>I suddenly had extra reason</i>
<i>to get away from her.</i>

159
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:43,822
<i>I had thoughtlessly ingested</i>
<i>a substance.</i>

160
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,292
Like the rent's not low enough!

161
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:48,057
<i>I had gotten remarkably</i>
<i>little information from Vernon</i>

162
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:49,860
<i>about what this drug would do.</i>

163
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:53,528
You could even be a bike messenger
and come up with that. Really.

164
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:55,901
<i>- What if it was a hallucinogen?</i>
- It's pathetic.

165
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:58,338
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Listening to her rag...</i>

166
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:00,103
<i>If I were tripping,</i>
<i>I'd jump out a fucking window.</i>

167
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:02,337
Hello? Are you listening to me?

168
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:05,438
Do you get it?
You are gonna be out on the streets!

169
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,278
<i>And then, I felt it.</i>

170
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:40,543
<i>I was blind, but now I see.</i>

171
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:58,125
...running away!
You can't even look at me, you know why?

172
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:00,431
Because you're not even a man.
You're not even a man!

173
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:03,870
You don't have rent!
You don't have a job!

174
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:18,045
- What's wrong?
- What?

175
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,611
You don't like me and I don't blame you.
You see a self-defeating,

176
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:23,385
energy-sucking piece of shit
who's sponging off your husband.

177
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:24,824
You're wishing I'd blow my brains out,

178
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:27,795
but my existence shouldn't make you
this upset. What is it?

179
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:31,527
- That's none of your business.
- Something wrong at law school?

180
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,999
How do you know I'm in law school?

181
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,695
People who aren't, usually
don't carry around dry,

182
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,295
academically-constipated books
about a dead Supreme Court justice.

183
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,372
You're a creep, aren't you?
You've been... You've been following me.

184
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:43,502
- No, I just noticed the book.
- You just saw the corner of it.

185
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:44,944
How did you know that?

186
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:48,108
<i>I'd seen it before.</i>
<i>Twelve years ago in college.</i>

187
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:50,481
<i>Sitting on the couch of a TA</i>
<i>I was trying to make,</i>

188
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:52,282
<i>waiting for her to come</i>
<i>back out of the bathroom,</i>

189
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:54,345
<i>hoping she'd have a condom.</i>

190
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,983
<i>Somehow my unconscious</i>
<i>had served that up.</i>

191
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:58,583
<i>A memory I had never even recorded.</i>

192
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:02,392
<i>Or was it there the whole time</i>
<i>and all I needed was the access?</i>

193
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:04,591
If you're writing a paper,
that's not the book I'd use.

194
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,464
Well, who asked you?

195
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:08,503
Hastings has his oral history.
I'd start there.

196
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:10,630
Interesting point.
Grammatically, this guy was an idiot,

197
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:12,071
which sort of gives credence
to the theory

198
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:13,130
that one of the clerks he had fired

199
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,369
actually wrote most of
this guy's major opinions.

200
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:17,776
You could Google the clerk's sons,
they'd love to talk to you.

201
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:20,542
Exonerate their dad. That'd give you
something that no one else has...

202
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,380
<i>Information from the odd</i>
<i>museum show, a half-read article,</i>

203
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:26,478
<i>some PBS documentary... it was all</i>
<i>bubbling up in my frontal lobes,</i>

204
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:30,013
<i>mixing itself together into a sparkling</i>
<i>cocktail of useful information.</i>

205
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:34,927
<i>- She didn't have a chance.</i>
- So, what are your suggestions?

206
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,997
<i>We'd really worked</i>
<i>on her paper, too.</i>

207
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:46,400
<i>In 45 minutes, it was a polished gem.</i>
<i>She was pleased.</i>

208
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:56,414
<i>Home. But it couldn't be my home,</i>
<i>could it?</i>

209
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:58,719
<i>Who would live like this?</i>

210
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:02,881
<i>My first thought: Torch it.</i>

211
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:04,859
<i>But saner heads prevailed.</i>

212
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,362
<i>What was this drug?</i>
<i>I couldn't stay messy on it,</i>

213
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:48,301
<i>I hadn't had a cigarette in six hours,</i>
<i>hadn't eaten, so... abstemious and tidy?</i>

214
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,828
<i>What was this? A drug for people who</i>
<i>wanted to be more anal retentive?</i>

215
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:54,740
<i>I wasn't high, I wasn't wired.</i>
<i>Just clear.</i>

216
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,301
<i>I knew what I needed to do</i>
<i>and how to do it.</i>

217
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:40,522
<i>The next morning, I sent</i>
<i>a little probe down into my brain.</i>

218
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,150
<i>No surge of brilliance</i>
<i>came up to greet me.</i>

219
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:50,794
<i>In short... I was back.</i>

220
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,405
<i>But, something remained.</i>

221
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:02,533
You're kidding.

222
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,607
- No.
- Words have appeared on paper.

223
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:09,674
- Yes.
- Written by you.

224
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,151
All you have to do is read three pages.

225
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,280
Just read three pages
in the next hour and...

226
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:16,916
...if you don't want to keep reading,
I'll give you back the advance.

227
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,053
OK.

228
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,662
- OK, Eddie.
- OK.

229
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:54,596
<i>Eddie,</i>
<i>give me a call when you get in.</i>

230
00:17:56,665 --> 00:18:01,295
<i>Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.</i>
<i>Call me.</i>

231
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,533
<i>It's a little grandiose,</i>
<i>but I'm still reading.</i>

232
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:08,373
<i>OK, how did you do this?</i>

233
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:13,575
<i>I'd really like... Just call me</i>
<i>the minute you get in. Call. OK?</i>

234
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:32,863
- Who is it?
- Hey, Vernon, it's Eddie.

235
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:37,429
- Eddie who?
- Uh, Morra.

236
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,903
It's not a good time, Eddie.

237
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:45,105
Uh, hey, Vern, I really
just need to talk to you.

238
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,311
Hey... Oh...

239
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:54,982
- Vern, what happened?
- Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

240
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:58,960
So, Eddie.
You are interested after all.

241
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:02,589
- That stuff's amazing.
- Works better if you're already smart.

242
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,328
Vern, who did this to you?

243
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:07,335
Trust me, you don't want to know.

244
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:11,769
Uh...

245
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,867
- So, uh, what's it called?
- Doesn't have a street name yet.

246
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:19,744
But the boys in the kitchen
are calling it NZT 48.

247
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:23,046
"The boys in the kitchen"?
I don't...

248
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:26,519
That doesn't sound
very FDA-approved, Vern.

249
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:31,252
FDA-approved, that's a laugh. You didn't
really believe that shit, did ya?

250
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:34,287
<i>OK, so what do we have here?</i>

251
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:37,526
<i>Some unknown, untested,</i>
<i>possibly dangerous drug</i>

252
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,965
<i>scammed out of some</i>
<i>unidentified lab somewhere</i>

253
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:44,404
<i>given to me by a highly unreliable guy</i>
<i>I hadn't seen in years.</i>

254
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:47,340
- So you want some more?
- Yes. Definitely.

255
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:53,314
All right, we'll talk about it,
but I, uh, need a favor first.

256
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:56,579
Obviously, I'm in no condition
to go out right now, so,

257
00:19:56,652 --> 00:20:02,318
I was wondering if you could pop down to
the dry cleaners, grab my suit for me.

258
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:06,760
And maybe grab a little...
a little breakfast for us.

259
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:09,993
<i>He knew he had me.</i>

260
00:20:10,766 --> 00:20:11,755
Sure.

261
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:16,701
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>I'd happily be his errand boy.</i>

262
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:20,071
<i>Wash his windows,</i>
<i>scrub his toilet...</i>

263
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:22,906
<i>... anything I could do to get my hands</i>
<i>on that little clear pill</i>

264
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:26,072
<i>that would bring back...</i>
<i>Enhanced Eddie.</i>

265
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:39,084
Vern?

266
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:50,967
Vern?

267
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:15,028
Vern...

268
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,793
Oh, Vern.

269
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:44,222
Hey, hey!

270
00:21:44,927 --> 00:21:46,417
Hey!

271
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,434
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>
- Hi, I need to report a...

272
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:03,944
...a murder.

273
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:08,876
7B, yes.

274
00:22:11,653 --> 00:22:13,177
OK, I won't.

275
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:20,287
<i>Took them forever. And the longer</i>
<i>I stood there, the clearer I saw.</i>

276
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:22,455
<i>Vern had known whoever had done this.</i>

277
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:26,394
<i>And one guess what</i>
<i>they'd been looking for.</i>

278
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:32,736
<i>But had they found it?</i>

279
00:23:12,147 --> 00:23:15,275
Shit, if you ever cooked,
I'd be dead, too.

280
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:52,612
Police Department!
Open the door, please!

281
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:58,024
Police Department! Open the door!

282
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,499
Open the door, please!

283
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:10,030
Police! Open the door!

284
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:13,040
Let's go! Open the door!

285
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,439
- Let me see your hands.
- Hey.

286
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:16,477
- Let me see your hands!
- No, no, I'm the one who called!

287
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:17,978
I called you guys!

288
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,881
So, you guys tight?
Hang out a lot?

289
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:27,786
No, my ex-wife's brother. I just
actually ran into him on the street

290
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:30,416
- and he asked me to come up to...
- Buy some drugs?

291
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:34,360
- No, no. What?
- What did this guy do?

292
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:37,762
He... Uh, I don't know. He was, um...

293
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,267
I heard that he was an antiques dealer?

294
00:24:40,335 --> 00:24:44,169
- A dealer?
- Yeah, uh, antiques. Um...

295
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:47,299
Like, uh, Viennese kinda, um...

296
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:50,143
...chairs and stuff.

297
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:52,908
Like, you know,
like curlicue leg things.

298
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:54,073
Yeah?

299
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,142
That is correct. An Edward Morra.

300
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,551
He's here.

301
00:25:00,522 --> 00:25:02,149
Victim's sister.

302
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:05,756
<i>I hadn't heard her voice</i>
<i>in ten years.</i>

303
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,225
<i>- Eddie?</i>
- Melissa?

304
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:12,866
<i>- You were there?</i>
- Um...

305
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:18,031
Just before. I had run into him
on the street and, uh... yeah.

306
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:19,903
<i>Oh, God.</i>

307
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:23,308
<i>I wish I was more surprised.</i>
<i>He was involved in some stuff.</i>

308
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:25,613
<i>I'd better not say any more.</i>

309
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,877
No, no, that's probably a good idea.

310
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,512
So, uh... We should probably, uh,
meet or something, right?

311
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:38,321
<i>No, I gotta do the funeral</i>
<i>and God knows what else. I just...</i>

312
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:40,588
<i>We can't meet, OK?</i>

313
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:43,028
Right. Well, I'll just... I guess I'll
just see you at the funeral then.

314
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:46,431
<i>No. I don't want that. Please</i>
<i>don't. I'll call you at some point, OK?</i>

315
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,527
<i>- When this is over.</i>
- OK, all right.

316
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:50,832
<i>OK.</i>

317
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:59,972
You know, something doesn't gel here.

318
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:03,677
Write down your number.
I may need to contact you later.

319
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:38,618
<i>Worth the risk?</i>

320
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,859
<i>What would you do?</i>

321
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:19,891
<i>Vern's cash, combined with</i>
<i>an unprecedented surge of motivation,</i>

322
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:22,601
<i>enabled me to finish the book</i>
<i>in four days.</i>

323
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,559
<i>A tablet a day</i>

324
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:37,071
<i>and what I could do</i>
<i>with my day was limitless.</i>

325
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,506
<i>I learned to play</i>
<i>the piano in three days.</i>

326
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:44,370
<i>Math became useful.</i>

327
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,407
<i>And fun.</i>

328
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,075
I'm all in.

329
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:55,290
<i>Even half-listening</i>
<i>to any language, I became fluent.</i>

330
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:05,323
So that Shakespeare's catchiness
belies mediocrity?

331
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:07,158
There's no arguing with you.

332
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,837
<i>This was great.</i>

333
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:14,638
So, Mom, I've been doing a little
research on Aunt Helen's tumor.

334
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:18,272
And it's totally clear that anybody with
familial adenomatous polyposis

335
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,578
should be supplementing
platinum-based doublet regiments

336
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,049
with eicosapentaeonic acid.

337
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,678
<i>I suddenly knew everything.</i>
<i>About everything.</i>

338
00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:27,245
Well, sure, you get a short-term spike,
but wouldn't that rapid expansion

339
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:29,086
devalue that stock completely
in two years?

340
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,684
- No, because there are safeguards.
- Against aggressive over-expansion?

341
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:34,093
There aren't. Because there are
no safeguards in human nature.

342
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:35,688
We're wired to overreach.

343
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:37,995
Look at history, all the countries
that ever ruled the world.

344
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,557
Portugal with this big massive navy.

345
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,433
All they got now are salt cod
and cheap condoms.

346
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:42,493
And the Brits?

347
00:28:42,572 --> 00:28:44,665
Now they're just sitting on a dank
little island fussing over their suits.

348
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,402
No one's stopping and thinking,
"Hey, we're doing pretty well.

349
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,910
We got France, we got Poland,
we got a big Swiss bank account.

350
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,673
You know what?
Let's not invade Russia in the winter.

351
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:53,545
Let's go home, let's pop a beer,
and let's live off the interest."

352
00:28:53,616 --> 00:28:55,083
Yeah.

353
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:57,480
<i>My brain was just</i>
<i>pouring this stuff out.</i>

354
00:28:57,554 --> 00:29:01,251
<i>Everything I had ever read, heard,</i>
<i>seen was now organized and available.</i>

355
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,383
<i>Here it is. Here you go.</i>

356
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,293
Eddie. Hey. Listen,
I'm sure you have a portfolio,

357
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:09,559
but if you don't, I'd be very
interested in working with you.

358
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:12,032
OK, Kevin.

359
00:29:12,535 --> 00:29:14,833
<i>I made some new friends</i>
<i>who invited me to the beach.</i>

360
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:17,722
<i>The beach was not nearby.</i>

361
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:32,533
<i>All my fear,</i>
<i>all my shyness, gone.</i>

362
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,471
They've done four basic trials...

363
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,969
<i>But mere lounging wasn't enough.</i>

364
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,962
<i>Only problem?</i>
<i>If I wasn't moving forward,</i>

365
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,304
<i>I felt like I was going to explode.</i>

366
00:30:09,376 --> 00:30:11,537
Come up here because
it's beautiful, right?

367
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:14,478
- Anybody ever jump?
- Are you crazy?

368
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:20,886
- He's gonna do it.
- He's not gonna do it.

369
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:23,980
Oh, my God!

370
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,659
Oh!

371
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:40,532
Ah!

372
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:44,668
<i>And then I began to form an idea.</i>

373
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:47,178
<i>Suddenly, I knew exactly</i>
<i>what I needed to do.</i>

374
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:49,841
<i>It wasn't writing.</i>
<i>It wasn't books.</i>

375
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,941
<i>It was much bigger than that.</i>

376
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:56,586
<i>But it would take money to get there.</i>

377
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,153
<i>In a down market,</i>
<i>no one was making much.</i>

378
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,662
<i>But no one had NZT.</i>

379
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:06,960
<i>In an optimistic scenario,</i>

380
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,864
<i>gains of that nature</i>
<i>merely would reflect</i>

381
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:11,836
<i>growth in the economy</i>
<i>and would not pose an obstacle...</i>

382
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:23,678
<i>Armed with Vern's last $800,</i>
<i>I made 2,000 in a day.</i>

383
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,082
<i>Next day, 7,500.</i>

384
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:29,553
<i>It was too slow.</i>
<i>I'd need more capital.</i>

385
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,588
<i>But banks weren't lending</i>
<i>to guys like me.</i>

386
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:33,648
Hey, Liev.

387
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,217
That's your man
in the corner back there.

388
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:41,560
Yeah.

389
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:54,595
So, uh, Liev told you that
I'm looking for a short-term loan?

390
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:56,568
Yeah, and I told Liev forget it.

391
00:31:57,137 --> 00:31:58,126
Why?

392
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:02,301
Because I don't see you before
and I don't fucking like you already.

393
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,344
Why do I give you $100,000?

394
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:06,976
Because...

395
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:12,545
...I quintupled my money
four days in a row.

396
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:14,587
So you got a fix on the game.

397
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:16,417
No, not a fix.

398
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:18,889
I was able to calculate certain patterns
using algorithms.

399
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,393
If you look at column four,
this was the first...

400
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:26,823
You're good.

401
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:30,258
OK, it's a fix.

402
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:33,397
Yeah, you know,
all you people get caught.

403
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:34,440
What are you gonna do then?

404
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,138
Well, it's not as if I have
a black book with your name in it,

405
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,003
if that's what you're talking about.

406
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,339
And besides, I get the strong feeling

407
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,277
that you're not somebody
I want to disappoint.

408
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:51,910
Don't get up.
I said don't get up.

409
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:53,318
- Sit down!
- Hey. OK.

410
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:58,554
- OK, you take this, you mine.
- OK.

411
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:02,255
You understand?
You don't pay, you know what we do?

412
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,355
I cut you at waist.

413
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:08,232
Peel your skin up over your head
and tie knot in it.

414
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,703
You don't die from this.
You suffocate.

415
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:13,138
- OK.
- Good luck.

416
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,915
<i>My new friend, Kevin Doyle,</i>
<i>showed me how you could leverage</i>

417
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:27,887
<i>two and a half times your cash</i>
<i>at the day trading firm.</i>

418
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:29,821
<i>I'd been upping the dose</i>
<i>for over a week.</i>

419
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,687
<i>It seemed to cut my learning curve.</i>

420
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:51,977
Why are you buying that?
The CEO was just indicted.

421
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:54,880
But not for the big fat defense contract
he bribed his way into.

422
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,383
That's still on.
Should be announced next week.

423
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,353
<i>I was jacked in. Booted up.</i>

424
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:02,219
<i>At the end of the week,</i>
<i>my brokerage account</i>

425
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,349
<i>contained over two million dollars.</i>

426
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,260
<i>Word quickly got out.</i>

427
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,126
<i>You have 19 messages.</i>

428
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:18,695
<i>Four job offers,</i>
<i>my bank raising my line of credit,</i>

429
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:20,434
<i>a reporter from the</i> New York Post.

430
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:22,442
<i>Really call me back, Mr. Morra.</i>

431
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,977
<i>No one makes money that fast.</i>

432
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:26,513
<i>This article's gonna get written</i>
<i>with or without you.</i>

433
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:29,709
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>Kevin Doyle trying to sound casual.</i>

434
00:34:29,784 --> 00:34:31,547
<i>Eddie, I was</i>
<i>talking you up to my boss</i>

435
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,213
<i>and, well,</i>
<i>the impossible happened, bud.</i>

436
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:37,122
<i>We got you a meeting with Carl Van Loon.</i>

437
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,683
Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?

438
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:43,424
- Apparently so.
- But you're not in the finance game.

439
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,126
What can you do for Carl Van Loon?

440
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:08,080
Since when do you speak Italian?

441
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,682
Oh.
Self-improvement month.

442
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:13,852
I guess somebody
gave me a wake up call.

443
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,129
I hope you didn't do it for me.

444
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,324
No, I just wanted
to apologize to you, Lin.

445
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:23,128
And let you know that apparently
my capacity for self-sabotage

446
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,195
wasn't boundless after all.

447
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:29,240
The real question is,
why did you ever put up with me?

448
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:32,339
I was in love with you.

449
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:40,645
So, when does the book come out?

450
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,622
Next year.
How's your new assistant?

451
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,385
- She's good.
- Good.

452
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,791
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

453
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:51,288
And, uh, are you gonna get a new...

454
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,634
You know...
I'm really happy you're here with me.

455
00:35:57,663 --> 00:36:01,690
I'm proud of you. And...

456
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:09,402
...a little intimidated.

457
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:13,079
<i>We started up again.</i>

458
00:36:16,392 --> 00:36:17,654
<i>Her place.</i>

459
00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:22,892
<i>My place.</i>

460
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:26,935
<i>Basically every place.</i>

461
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,801
"In a sizzling
three days of trading,

462
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:35,708
the unknown Mr. Morra
trumped the market,

463
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:38,679
prompting one top
hedge fund manager to comment:

464
00:36:38,748 --> 00:36:41,615
'He's Houdini.
He's a prophet of our times."'

465
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:42,673
OK, give me that.
Give me that!

466
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:45,381
- "He's God"?
- You coming over later?

467
00:36:45,988 --> 00:36:48,286
I can't. I don't have a key.

468
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:49,313
Oh, that's right.

469
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,641
- Can I have it back?
- Uh... Nope.

470
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,575
- No?
- I mean, does it have to be that key?

471
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:57,476
Can it be a new key?

472
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:00,344
To our place?

473
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:06,021
- It would be cost effective.
- And you say I'm not practical.

474
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,294
Can I walk you to work?

475
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,382
Whatcha doing, hon?

476
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:40,916
Nothing.

477
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:43,923
You should sleep.

478
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,628
Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?

479
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:06,104
Eddie?

480
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:08,013
Are you OK?

481
00:38:10,286 --> 00:38:12,413
What are you doing out here?

482
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:19,026
When's the last time you ate something?

483
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:30,368
There he is.
Nice article in the <i>Post,</i> buddy.

484
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:35,036
OK, he is on his way.

485
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:38,440
Now, be warned. He's mercurial.

486
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,874
One minute, your best friend,
the next, you're a leper.

487
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:46,081
And he needs direct answers. Anything
tentative and you've lost him forever.

488
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:49,818
I think we should rehearse
a few scenarios.

489
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:51,654
I'm eating, Kevin.

490
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:53,856
Hey, are you up for this?

491
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:57,122
You sure? 'Cause I got
a little bit on the line here.

492
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,293
Have a toast point.

493
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:03,872
- It's Carl Van Loon.
- That's Carl Van Loon.

494
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,929
He's worth a fortune.

495
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:08,205
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Carl. Good to see you.

496
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:09,835
- How are ya?
- Eddie.

497
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:19,387
So, Eddie Morra.

498
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:22,481
- What's your secret?
- Medication.

499
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:24,253
I'm on special medication.

500
00:39:24,827 --> 00:39:26,317
OK.

501
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:30,861
Well, it's a formula
with a complex method.

502
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:33,367
But, of course, research was
a component. Massive research.

503
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:36,496
I knew every helix of every scrap of DNA
in every company I bought.

504
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:39,200
Papers stacked like the Himalayas
in my office, and you know what?

505
00:39:39,275 --> 00:39:41,436
- The stocks went up.
- By a hair.

506
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:44,674
Sure, the stocks rose,
but who wants to do all that work

507
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:46,305
for a shitty little uptake?

508
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:49,545
It's not the visceral kind of spike
you want in short term holdings so...

509
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,314
...I dispensed
with all the hard statistics

510
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:52,684
and I went right to the rumor mill.

511
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:55,918
So you bought your stocks based on what?
The tom-toms beating in the street?

512
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:59,484
Sure. Share prices aren't really
based on how a company works.

513
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:01,052
It's about how mass psychology works.

514
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,360
So, if I found certain algorithms
in the perception of the stock...

515
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:05,765
Pattern recognition.
That's your snake oil.

516
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:08,133
Well, not everybody
understands the patterns.

517
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:10,900
And that gave me a little bit more of
an uptake, but it's just a parlor trick.

518
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:12,600
So then, I went on
to door number three.

519
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:16,008
Are you really implying that you have
some sort of ultimate formula?

520
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,344
Well, from 12,000 to
2.3 million in ten days.

521
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:22,873
- I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
- Delusions of grandeur.

522
00:40:22,952 --> 00:40:27,184
I don't have delusions of grandeur,
I have an actual recipe for grandeur.

523
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:33,289
I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what
you game is, but I'm sure of one thing.

524
00:40:33,362 --> 00:40:34,727
You don't work in my world.

525
00:40:34,797 --> 00:40:38,233
I'm up to my ass with investment guys
and you don't have their half-terrified,

526
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:40,360
half-cocky line of crap which is...

527
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:43,166
...not to say that
I like yours any better.

528
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,208
But you obviously pick your stocks
in a way which I haven't seen before.

529
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:50,211
Take a look at these companies
and tell me what you think.

530
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,645
- Right now?
- Yeah. Take your time.

531
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:56,517
Sure.

532
00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:12,026
These companies aren't the question,
are they?

533
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:14,765
Explain.

534
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:18,398
Unless you're playing
both sides of the fence.

535
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:20,305
Control the whole power enchilada,
but, no,

536
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,867
these companies wouldn't get you there
in emerging markets.

537
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:25,004
You would have to... Oh. Whoa.

538
00:41:25,081 --> 00:41:28,710
This must be some big-ass merger
you're contemplating.

539
00:41:30,887 --> 00:41:32,718
And there's really only one company
with enough bling

540
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:34,779
to justify a merger
with Van Loon and Associates.

541
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:37,787
Who have you been talking to?

542
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,523
Oh, I'm just connecting the dots.
Is Hank Atwood really gonna go for it?

543
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:45,124
Well, you're an amazing con artist,
or you're a very smart young man.

544
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:47,931
I mean, come on.
The two of you together?

545
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,562
The whole world would have
to come begging for energy

546
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:51,664
like Oliver Twist and his bowl of gruel.

547
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:54,266
Now you're going backwards.
What else you got?

548
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:58,609
- A prediction. It won't come off.
- Why's that?

549
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:02,048
- You'd have to back off Libya.
- Really?

550
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:06,619
Well, you don't want to hear this from
some schmuck who needs a ride home.

551
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:10,386
All right, you get your shot. Meet me
tomorrow at the Saint Regis at ten

552
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:12,723
and tell me how the gutsy little schmuck
who needs a ride home

553
00:42:12,795 --> 00:42:16,026
would re-structure these deals.
And you'd better be prepared.

554
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:17,622
I'm at your disposal.

555
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,691
You don't really live here,
do you?

556
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:21,999
Well... Spartans weren't
big on amenities.

557
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:25,368
Yeah, and they eventually
got their asses kicked.

558
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:37,852
<i>I didn't go in. I wanted</i>
<i>to walk, move, digest, ingest.</i>

559
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:41,226
<i>There are moments in life... moments</i>
<i>when you know you've crossed a bridge.</i>

560
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:42,628
<i>Your old life is over.</i>

561
00:42:42,698 --> 00:42:45,599
<i>Van Loon was my bridge.</i>
<i>I finally had my shot.</i>

562
00:42:45,668 --> 00:42:49,195
<i>Wall Street would provide my nest egg,</i>
<i>but then how far could I go?</i>

563
00:42:49,271 --> 00:42:52,968
<i>CEO? A global force?</i>
<i>Maybe President.</i>

564
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:55,306
<i>Time somebody shook up the free world</i>
<i>and got things done.</i>

565
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:09,654
<i>Suddenly...</i>

566
00:43:11,495 --> 00:43:16,296
<i>It was another skip.</i>
<i>How had I gone the last 20 blocks?</i>

567
00:43:18,502 --> 00:43:22,768
<i>I got another ten blocks.</i>
<i>And then...</i>

568
00:43:25,142 --> 00:43:27,235
<i>... I was way uptown.</i>

569
00:44:10,554 --> 00:44:12,886
<i>What bar was this?</i>

570
00:44:25,535 --> 00:44:29,027
...black canvas and then they would
just drop all the paint...

571
00:44:31,174 --> 00:44:33,574
Yeah. Did you ever meet...

572
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:37,305
...and then I actually went
there and had lunch, I went back.

573
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,404
My friends are rolling...

574
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,584
<i>I heard you like to party.</i>

575
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,974
- Hey, watch it.
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!

576
00:45:09,045 --> 00:45:12,071
<i>A fight? Don't know how to fight.</i>

577
00:45:12,149 --> 00:45:13,639
<i>Or do I?</i>

578
00:45:22,225 --> 00:45:23,214
Ah!

579
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:26,126
<i>You use the fishhook action</i>
<i>to get inside the mouth.</i>

580
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:29,431
<i>Like this.</i>

581
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:42,077
<i>Attack the sensitive areas.</i>
<i>The eyes, the throat, the groin.</i>

582
00:45:46,716 --> 00:45:49,776
<i>If you are hit, do not stop.</i>

583
00:45:49,853 --> 00:45:52,447
<i>Your persistence will</i>
<i>discourage your attacker.</i>

584
00:45:54,157 --> 00:45:55,283
<i>Off-balancing your opponent</i>

585
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,225
<i>and then using his momentum,</i>
<i>take him down.</i>

586
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:31,624
<i>When it finally stopped,</i>

587
00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:35,222
<i>I couldn't account</i>
<i>for the last 18 hours of my life.</i>

588
00:46:57,354 --> 00:47:00,016
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
<i>I thought you were coming over.</i>

589
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,116
<i>Is everything OK?</i>
<i>Call me when you get this.</i>

590
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,201
<i>Even off NZT, I decided</i>
<i>to give Van Loon's files a shot.</i>

591
00:47:54,312 --> 00:47:56,610
<i>They were hieroglyphs.</i>

592
00:47:59,984 --> 00:48:02,578
- Hello?
<i>- Kevin, this is Eddie.</i>

593
00:48:02,654 --> 00:48:03,678
- Eddie?
<i>- Listen,</i>

594
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,690
<i>- I can't make the meeting today.</i>
- What are you talking about?

595
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:09,425
I can't come in today, I'm sick.

596
00:48:09,494 --> 00:48:11,724
Yeah, well you can't
have the flu right now.

597
00:48:11,796 --> 00:48:13,093
He'll never give you this chance again.

598
00:48:13,164 --> 00:48:18,761
I know, listen, I just...
I have all this data to analyze...

599
00:48:18,836 --> 00:48:21,600
<i>What have you been doing</i>
<i>for the last day?</i>

600
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:25,942
- Kev, I...
- Don't you get it? This is your test.

601
00:48:26,644 --> 00:48:29,613
Yeah, well, I can't
pass the test right now.

602
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:31,842
And how am I gonna look if you don't?

603
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:34,612
<i>- I know, listen, I just...</i>
- Sh. Listen to me.

604
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:37,450
Pull yourself together.
Get down to the meeting.

605
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:47,488
OK, OK.
I'll be there. I'll be there.

606
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:11,284
- Hey, how are ya?
- Eddie.

607
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:13,017
Good to see you again.

608
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:15,589
Sit down.

609
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:21,055
What do you know about Hank Atwood?

610
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:22,995
Atwood, um...

611
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:26,929
He's an iconoclast, um...

612
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:31,941
Owns about half of Colorado.

613
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:35,070
So this is prepared, Eddie?

614
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:37,137
Uh...

615
00:49:37,215 --> 00:49:40,412
Is this Atwood 101?
Doesn't everybody know about Atwood?

616
00:49:40,485 --> 00:49:42,112
Where was he two years ago?

617
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:47,456
- Hm?
- Nowhere.

618
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:52,219
Two years ago he wasn't
even on <i>Forbes'</i> radar.

619
00:49:53,598 --> 00:49:56,089
That was a great leap forward, right?

620
00:49:56,968 --> 00:50:00,734
I'm baffled by this guy.
He comes out of nowhere so strong.

621
00:50:00,805 --> 00:50:03,774
Has me on the run before I can
even get to anybody in his camp.

622
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:05,502
Beats me
out of two properties,

623
00:50:05,576 --> 00:50:08,170
investing in countries with no oil.
Places I'd never go near...

624
00:50:15,553 --> 00:50:17,885
<i>We're here in front</i>
<i>of the hotel where a woman,</i>

625
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:21,721
<i>identified as Maria Winberg,</i>
<i>was found dead in her room last night,</i>

626
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:26,526
<i>a victim of foul play. Ms. Winberg</i>
<i>was a well-known socialite and model...</i>

627
00:50:27,965 --> 00:50:32,231
<i>... but was also known for her dedicated</i>
<i>charity work around the city.</i>

628
00:50:32,303 --> 00:50:35,500
<i>Police spent hours questioning</i>
<i>hotel staff and patrons</i>

629
00:50:35,573 --> 00:50:38,770
<i>and an eyewitness reported</i>
<i>seeing a man leaving the scene...</i>

630
00:50:38,843 --> 00:50:42,574
help me convince him that I can
raise his game. Got any ideas?

631
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:44,410
What do you think?

632
00:50:45,783 --> 00:50:47,648
- Hm?
- Um...

633
00:50:47,718 --> 00:50:50,152
<i>hotel has adequate</i>
<i>security cameras...</i>

634
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:57,326
You're not one of those
kind of guys, are you Eddie?

635
00:50:57,395 --> 00:50:59,454
We lose you if there's
a screen in the room?

636
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:04,429
These are tectonic plates
that are shifting right under us.

637
00:51:04,502 --> 00:51:06,129
Pardon me, one second.

638
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:31,920
<i>Was it possible?</i>
<i>Could I have killed someone?</i>

639
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,092
<i>Was it even me?</i>

640
00:51:40,771 --> 00:51:43,399
<i>Eddie? This is Melissa.</i>

641
00:51:43,474 --> 00:51:45,669
<i>Listen, Vernon hasn't been</i>
<i>giving you anything, has he?</i>

642
00:51:45,743 --> 00:51:47,370
<i>Because that stuff is dangerous.</i>

643
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:48,912
Melissa?

644
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,346
Melissa, hey, do you think
that we can meet somewhere?

645
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:54,111
- I really need to talk to you.
<i>- We're talking now.</i>

646
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:57,518
No, no, let's meet at, uh...
Billy's on Grant at noon?

647
00:51:57,588 --> 00:51:59,920
<i>- You can't see me, Eddie.</i>
- No, no...

648
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:03,119
<i>- Eddie, please.</i>
- Please, please come, please come, I...

649
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:06,254
It's important, I really need to know
what you're talking about.

650
00:52:08,866 --> 00:52:12,097
<i>I realized that there were</i>
<i>other people who might know about NZT.</i>

651
00:52:12,169 --> 00:52:14,569
<i>Vernon's other clients.</i>

652
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:55,334
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Yeah, hi,

653
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:56,880
may I please speak with Jerry Brady?

654
00:52:56,948 --> 00:52:59,348
<i>- Jerry's in the hospital.</i>
- He's what?

655
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:01,282
<i>Yeah, he's not doing well at all.</i>

656
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:06,221
- Yeah, hello, is Paul Kaplan there?
<i>- Uh, no. No, he's not.</i>

657
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:09,555
<i>Uh, Paul passed away three days ago.</i>

658
00:53:10,695 --> 00:53:12,458
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

659
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:15,124
<i>Yeah, he started getting headaches,</i>
<i>then he collapsed at work.</i>

660
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,632
<i>Now he's in the ICU.</i>

661
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:18,931
OK, please give him my best.
Thank you.

662
00:53:19,003 --> 00:53:24,373
<i>Of all the people I called...</i>
<i>three were dead and the rest were sick.</i>

663
00:53:47,331 --> 00:53:51,961
Hello? Hello?

664
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,145
Watch it, man!

665
00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:29,531
Did you see that?

666
00:54:31,075 --> 00:54:32,099
Hey!

667
00:54:37,915 --> 00:54:41,351
Go! Go!

668
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,476
Eddie.

669
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:13,380
Melissa.

670
00:55:20,624 --> 00:55:21,921
Hey.

671
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,129
Don't tell me I look good,
'cause I know.

672
00:55:31,102 --> 00:55:33,093
I didn't want you to see me this way.

673
00:55:33,704 --> 00:55:35,569
You look good.

674
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:38,369
Oh, I, uh...

675
00:55:38,442 --> 00:55:40,467
Yeah, I sorta got myself together.

676
00:55:40,544 --> 00:55:43,035
NZT will do that to you.

677
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:46,015
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I took it, too.

678
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:49,748
Vernon didn't tell you
any of this, did he?

679
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,912
No.

680
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:52,717
Well, when he told me
about this amazing new drug,

681
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:56,749
I was like, down the hatch.
And it was. It was amazing.

682
00:55:56,827 --> 00:56:00,490
I read Brian Greene's
<i>The Elegant Universe</i> in 45 minutes

683
00:56:00,564 --> 00:56:02,429
and I understood it.

684
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,798
My work rate increased
just insanely overnight

685
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:06,564
and my boss started to hate me.

686
00:56:08,372 --> 00:56:13,275
They offered me his job and then...
and then I got scared.

687
00:56:14,178 --> 00:56:16,442
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm not stupid.

688
00:56:16,514 --> 00:56:19,779
Nobody can operate at that level
of mental activity and not crash.

689
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,485
I stopped taking it.

690
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:28,924
- And?
- And I got sick. Headaches.

691
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:34,329
Throwing up.
So I went back to Vernon.

692
00:56:34,398 --> 00:56:36,889
He told me about all the people
that were dying.

693
00:56:38,202 --> 00:56:40,170
How much have you
been taking, Eddie?

694
00:56:40,237 --> 00:56:41,898
I've been taking a lot.

695
00:56:43,507 --> 00:56:47,910
Well, maybe... maybe they've
worked out the bugs. Maybe...

696
00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:50,371
Maybe this is a different batch.

697
00:56:51,816 --> 00:56:54,649
- Yeah.
- You're off it right now, aren't you?

698
00:56:54,718 --> 00:56:57,209
- Just finish your story.
- Well...

699
00:56:57,288 --> 00:57:00,155
...I didn't take any more
and I didn't die.

700
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:04,586
But after a while, I realized I
couldn't concentrate on anything

701
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:05,856
for longer than ten minutes.

702
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:11,027
I, uh... I missed deadlines,
got lazy, slow, so slow.

703
00:57:11,735 --> 00:57:14,203
That was two years ago.

704
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,199
And I haven't been the same since.

705
00:57:22,913 --> 00:57:26,815
Do you have some left? Good.

706
00:57:26,884 --> 00:57:30,251
You go home and you take it. You take
the dose down, but you don't just stop.

707
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,084
You'll die if you just stop.

708
00:57:32,723 --> 00:57:37,524
Try to taper off, otherwise
the headaches are just the beginning.

709
00:57:39,697 --> 00:57:41,062
I have to go.

710
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:45,527
- Do you know who makes it?
- I don't know.

711
00:57:47,104 --> 00:57:48,571
I have to go.

712
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:24,071
Oh, shit. Listen, listen, listen.
Listen, listen, listen... OK.

713
00:58:24,141 --> 00:58:25,870
- You forget about me, huh?
- No, no, no, no.

714
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:27,911
12:00 and you're not here.

715
00:58:27,978 --> 00:58:30,970
- I'm here now. Oh!
- Good.

716
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:34,277
- Come on, get going.
- I could write you a check.

717
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:39,345
Check. Check.
Are you out of your mind?

718
00:58:39,423 --> 00:58:41,687
What do you think I am?
Some financial institution?

719
00:58:41,759 --> 00:58:43,852
All right. You're right.
Look, we just need to go to a bank...

720
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,799
What do you got there?

721
00:58:55,105 --> 00:58:57,505
- What is it?
- No, it's just aspirin.

722
00:58:57,574 --> 00:59:03,069
Don't look like no aspirin I ever see.
It's something good, huh?

723
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:25,995
I feel good, man.
What's in this stuff?

724
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:28,868
It's just, uh, vitamins and aspirin.

725
00:59:28,939 --> 00:59:32,670
You full of shit, Eddie baby.

726
00:59:58,202 --> 01:00:01,194
Lindy. I wouldn't
have let him in, but...

727
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:04,001
I'm sorry... Tyler, I gotta go.

728
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:06,870
I'm sick.

729
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:12,280
I shouldn't... I'm sorry.
I couldn't make it home.

730
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:15,443
- Let's get you to a hospital.
- No, no, no, no, no. I don't need...

731
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:16,577
I need you to get...

732
01:00:16,653 --> 01:00:20,646
It's really simple, babe.
I need my pills.

733
01:00:20,724 --> 01:00:23,318
- Eddie, what pills?
- I don't... Babe, it's complicated.

734
01:00:23,394 --> 01:00:26,158
What are you taking?
Are you on drugs?

735
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:29,199
They're... it's...

736
01:00:29,266 --> 01:00:32,565
<i>I had no choice.</i>
<i>I told Lindy everything.</i>

737
01:00:34,271 --> 01:00:38,674
So all this energy of yours,
all this focus...

738
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:40,073
...has been a drug.

739
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:42,510
Well, it was supposed to be legal.

740
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:46,174
I have a... a supply stashed.

741
01:00:47,951 --> 01:00:49,714
You want me to go get it.

742
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:53,245
- No. No, no, no. I'm gonna go get it.
- Give me your keys.

743
01:00:53,323 --> 01:00:54,984
I'll go to your apartment.

744
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:58,961
It's not... in my apartment.
I moved it.

745
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:02,829
OK, so where did you move it?

746
01:01:09,562 --> 01:01:11,462
In my house.

747
01:01:13,076 --> 01:01:14,509
Unbelievable.

748
01:01:26,604 --> 01:01:29,368
Hey, have you got it?

749
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,998
Yeah.

750
01:01:33,077 --> 01:01:34,601
There's someone following me.

751
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,408
Are you sure?

752
01:01:37,482 --> 01:01:39,950
Yeah. He got into the cab behind me

753
01:01:40,018 --> 01:01:42,043
and he's making every turn I'm making.

754
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,954
- Baby, call the cops.
- Can you go around him?

755
01:01:46,024 --> 01:01:47,321
<i>Babe, what's happening?</i>

756
01:01:47,392 --> 01:01:49,155
We're stopped dead.

757
01:01:50,461 --> 01:01:52,861
He's getting out.

758
01:01:52,931 --> 01:01:55,525
Eddie, he's walking over here.

759
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,897
Lindy?

760
01:01:57,468 --> 01:01:58,526
Oh, God!

761
01:02:00,405 --> 01:02:01,531
Ow!

762
01:02:13,651 --> 01:02:16,643
Help! Help!

763
01:02:18,256 --> 01:02:20,850
This man's...
This man's chasing me!

764
01:02:20,925 --> 01:02:24,452
He followed me from
my building. I don't know him.

765
01:02:24,529 --> 01:02:27,930
- Please!
- Yo, buddy, let's leave her alone!

766
01:02:30,435 --> 01:02:32,596
Are you deaf?
I said leave her alone.

767
01:02:34,706 --> 01:02:36,799
Hey, buddy, are you
trying to piss me off?

768
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,840
What are you doing, man?

769
01:03:12,396 --> 01:03:15,331
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here. What happened?

770
01:03:15,399 --> 01:03:18,562
I'm stuck. He'll find me.

771
01:03:18,636 --> 01:03:20,627
<i>OK, stop talking. Don't move.</i>

772
01:03:20,705 --> 01:03:23,367
<i>- He killed two guys.</i>
- What?

773
01:03:23,441 --> 01:03:26,672
- He's gonna kill me, too.
- No, no, no...

774
01:03:26,744 --> 01:03:27,870
Can he see you?

775
01:03:31,582 --> 01:03:33,106
No.

776
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:35,683
Not yet.

777
01:03:37,054 --> 01:03:39,614
I don't know what to do.

778
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,387
OK, I need you to go into the bag
and take one of the pills.

779
01:03:44,228 --> 01:03:45,525
Why?

780
01:03:45,596 --> 01:03:48,030
<i>Because you'll know what to do.</i>
<i>You'll take it and then you'll know.</i>

781
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:52,001
He's got a knife. Eddie, I can't
think my way out of a knife.

782
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,297
Just listen to me.
It'll come on in 30 seconds.

783
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,273
And you'll think your way out.
That's what it does.

784
01:04:20,765 --> 01:04:24,360
He's getting closer.

785
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:28,471
Lindy, I love you.

786
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:02,105
Hey!

787
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,402
Now turn to me...

788
01:05:43,214 --> 01:05:44,943
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

789
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
- Ah!
- Daddy!

790
01:05:49,386 --> 01:05:50,944
Ah!

791
01:05:59,663 --> 01:06:01,255
Eddie. Here.

792
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:04,459
It's gonna be OK.

793
01:06:06,771 --> 01:06:10,229
We've got to get out of here. Eddie?

794
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:46,444
You OK?

795
01:06:47,915 --> 01:06:49,712
Yeah.

796
01:06:51,586 --> 01:06:54,919
I'm so sorry about what happened.

797
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:58,117
I want you to know that you never,
ever have to go through that again,

798
01:06:58,192 --> 01:07:00,956
'cause I can take care of us now.

799
01:07:01,028 --> 01:07:03,053
I'm sure you can.

800
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,655
I can make us safe.
I'm back, OK?

801
01:07:09,937 --> 01:07:12,235
- Who's back, Eddie?
- Me.

802
01:07:12,306 --> 01:07:14,740
No. It's not you.

803
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:18,404
- You were different before.
- I'm still the same person, Lin.

804
01:07:18,479 --> 01:07:20,106
I wasn't, when I was on it.

805
01:07:21,315 --> 01:07:23,476
I did things I would never do.

806
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:26,145
- Those things saved your life.
- But they weren't me.

807
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,778
Yes, they were.
No, the way it works...

808
01:07:27,855 --> 01:07:30,323
I know how it works. I get it.

809
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:33,155
I totally get it.
You feel invincible.

810
01:07:34,428 --> 01:07:37,090
Where it will take us, Lin,
you can't even imagine.

811
01:07:37,164 --> 01:07:41,624
The things we'll be able to do.
Where we'll be a year from now.

812
01:07:41,702 --> 01:07:45,365
The kind of life that
we'll finally be able to live.

813
01:07:45,439 --> 01:07:48,636
Well, you might have
to live it without me.

814
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,342
Look, I am gonna stop taking it.
There's just some things I have to do

815
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:58,943
to keep us safe and that... To set us up
and then I'm gonna get off it.

816
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:00,647
- I mean, that's the plan.
- Eddie...

817
01:08:00,721 --> 01:08:03,019
Look, I have a plan. I swear.

818
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:04,887
I'm gonna get off it.

819
01:08:06,327 --> 01:08:07,658
OK.

820
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,188
I hope you do.

821
01:08:43,397 --> 01:08:45,297
Looking for me?

822
01:08:47,668 --> 01:08:51,331
You think you can run out on me, huh?
You think I don't know where you are?

823
01:08:51,405 --> 01:08:53,202
I was under the impression
our business was settled.

824
01:08:53,274 --> 01:08:55,071
I want some more of that stuff.

825
01:08:55,142 --> 01:08:58,111
Or I shoot you right here.
Take your pick.

826
01:08:58,179 --> 01:08:59,976
<i>This guy was not going away.</i>

827
01:09:00,047 --> 01:09:01,810
<i>A few pills would buy me some time.</i>

828
01:09:01,882 --> 01:09:05,283
- There it is. We're done.
- Oh, yeah. We'll see.

829
01:09:05,353 --> 01:09:07,947
<i>Until I found a more...</i>
<i>permanent solution.</i>

830
01:09:08,623 --> 01:09:12,491
Unless you see a real threat, I never
want it known that I have any security.

831
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,790
You'll never precede me,
you'll always follow me.

832
01:09:14,862 --> 01:09:18,320
Never more than 15 steps behind.
And never stand too close together.

833
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,095
I want to able to look behind me
if the opportunity presents itself.

834
01:09:22,536 --> 01:09:24,800
And don't wear the same color suit.
This isn't <i>The Matrix.</i>

835
01:09:30,544 --> 01:09:32,705
You have to know, Eddie,
I wrote you off.

836
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,441
- I was sick.
- You don't get sick.

837
01:09:34,515 --> 01:09:37,245
You're playing at this level, you get
hit by a car, you don't even die.

838
01:09:37,318 --> 01:09:39,980
- You're absolutely right.
- I know I'm right.

839
01:09:40,054 --> 01:09:41,954
I mean, I didn't know who or what
I was talking to.

840
01:09:42,023 --> 01:09:45,254
A hundred and five. That's who
you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.

841
01:09:45,326 --> 01:09:47,851
Mm-hm.

842
01:09:47,928 --> 01:09:49,225
I sent over my revised projections.

843
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:51,198
I didn't ask for your projections.

844
01:09:51,265 --> 01:09:53,358
I know, but I think if
you take a look at them...

845
01:09:54,302 --> 01:09:56,133
I already have.
As a matter of fact...

846
01:09:57,705 --> 01:10:00,902
...I fired a few people
over your projections.

847
01:10:00,975 --> 01:10:02,602
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

848
01:10:02,677 --> 01:10:05,510
You're relieved that you know things
my team missed.

849
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:10,107
The minute,
the instant that's no longer true...

850
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,612
<i>Two months after I'd started NZT,</i>

851
01:10:14,689 --> 01:10:17,817
<i>I was brokering the biggest merger</i>
<i>in corporate history.</i>

852
01:10:17,892 --> 01:10:22,329
Ironically, it's gonna be crude. Crude
is gonna be where we're gonna hit them.

853
01:10:22,396 --> 01:10:25,024
Which yields a prospective profit
of 200 percent.

854
01:10:25,099 --> 01:10:26,964
That makes both of us
very happy campers.

855
01:10:27,034 --> 01:10:29,434
<i>I found that if</i>
<i>I maintained an even dose,</i>

856
01:10:29,503 --> 01:10:31,869
<i>remembered to eat,</i>
<i>drank no alcohol,</i>

857
01:10:31,939 --> 01:10:34,339
<i>- the blackouts didn't recur.</i>
- How you doing, Eddie?

858
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:38,278
Tom, is it possible to construct
an imperceptible compartment?

859
01:10:38,346 --> 01:10:39,813
In this jacket?

860
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,316
- In all of them.
- Certainly, sir.

861
01:10:43,384 --> 01:10:47,514
<i>Safer though my stash now was, I</i>
<i>was not sitting around until it ran out.</i>

862
01:10:47,588 --> 01:10:50,921
Can I combine these ingredients
in the same exact quantity, yes, but,

863
01:10:50,991 --> 01:10:55,792
the exact method of delivery
to the brain... Darts at a dartboard.

864
01:10:55,863 --> 01:10:58,491
- Meaning?
- Clinical trials, guinea pig people.

865
01:10:58,566 --> 01:11:01,091
- That's gonna take too long.
- It's what it is.

866
01:11:01,168 --> 01:11:04,660
Or you'll kill people.
You need 12, to 18 months...

867
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:06,866
I'll give you two million dollars
if you can do it in six.

868
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:19,352
I found that we can cut costs
30 percent and, um...

869
01:11:22,757 --> 01:11:24,088
Excuse me one second.

870
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:29,823
I thought we straightened this out,
Detective.

871
01:11:29,897 --> 01:11:33,833
This isn't about Vernon Gant,
Mr. Morra.

872
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:36,301
What is this about?

873
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:41,706
The witness identified the Maria Winberg
suspect as this person.

874
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:49,281
Wanna tell me your whereabouts
the night of April 2nd?

875
01:11:50,852 --> 01:11:53,047
<i>I couldn't keep</i>
<i>this quiet on my own.</i>

876
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:58,750
<i>Enter Morris Brandt...</i>
<i>the most lethal lawyer in New York.</i>

877
01:12:01,763 --> 01:12:06,427
You're lucky somebody wiped the room.
It's weak. Circumstantial at best.

878
01:12:06,501 --> 01:12:09,527
Just between us, were you there?

879
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:10,832
I don't remember.

880
01:12:12,373 --> 01:12:13,965
I don't want to
make concessions to you...

881
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:16,101
<i>Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood</i>

882
01:12:16,177 --> 01:12:20,170
<i>had no idea I might</i>
<i>soon be charged with murder.</i>

883
01:12:20,248 --> 01:12:22,944
But SyCorps, Andine
and others are jockeying

884
01:12:23,017 --> 01:12:25,042
for the same industrial
concessions in Libya

885
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:27,383
that both our companies are
pretending we're not sniffing out.

886
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:28,820
How do you know this?

887
01:12:29,824 --> 01:12:32,486
The governmental bribe system
is itself corrupt, so, of course,

888
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,688
information about its inner workings,
like anything, can be bought.

889
01:12:38,266 --> 01:12:39,665
Go on.

890
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:43,135
If you take a look at the lower
left-hand column, in 2008,

891
01:12:43,204 --> 01:12:46,640
five companies were jockeying for a
position before we even took notice.

892
01:12:50,011 --> 01:12:51,706
Jesus, he looks frail.

893
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:55,113
- Could be an act.
- He's not even 60.

894
01:12:57,452 --> 01:13:00,512
So, have you decided, Eddie?
What are you gonna do?

895
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:03,682
When this is over? I don't know.

896
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:05,157
You haven't given me the answer.

897
01:13:05,226 --> 01:13:07,091
You haven't asked the question.

898
01:13:07,161 --> 01:13:08,924
Well, given the scale
of my contribution,

899
01:13:08,996 --> 01:13:11,328
let's say 45.

900
01:13:11,399 --> 01:13:14,391
Done. Forty-five thousand dollars.

901
01:13:14,469 --> 01:13:17,905
Forty million is plenty, Eddie.
There's a lot more where that came from.

902
01:13:17,972 --> 01:13:20,304
You know, Eddie...

903
01:13:20,374 --> 01:13:21,432
...it may be on your mind

904
01:13:21,509 --> 01:13:23,909
that you're not gonna
continue to work for me anymore.

905
01:13:23,978 --> 01:13:25,707
This has been
the learning experience of my life.

906
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,271
I hope it has. I hope you don't
think you've gotten enough from me.

907
01:13:28,349 --> 01:13:29,873
On to the next.

908
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:32,715
Well, in order for a career to evolve,
I'm gonna have to move on.

909
01:13:32,787 --> 01:13:35,278
That you would even think that
would only show me

910
01:13:35,356 --> 01:13:37,790
how unprepared you are
to be on your own.

911
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:40,225
I mean, you do know you're a freak.

912
01:13:40,294 --> 01:13:42,819
Your deductive powers are a gift
from God, or chance,

913
01:13:42,897 --> 01:13:45,229
or a stray shot of sperm,
or whatever, or whoever the hell wrote

914
01:13:45,299 --> 01:13:47,597
your life script, a gift not earned.

915
01:13:47,668 --> 01:13:51,570
You do not know what I know because
you have not earned those powers.

916
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:53,368
You're careless with those powers.

917
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:56,740
You flaunt them and you throw them
around like a brat with his trust fund.

918
01:13:56,811 --> 01:13:59,780
You haven't had to climb up
all the greasy little rungs.

919
01:13:59,847 --> 01:14:02,839
You haven't been bored blind at the
fundraisers. You haven't done the time

920
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:04,748
in that first marriage
to the girl with the right father.

921
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:07,549
You think you can leap
over all in a single bound.

922
01:14:07,622 --> 01:14:10,147
You haven't had to bribe
or charm or threaten your way

923
01:14:10,224 --> 01:14:13,421
to a seat at that table. You don't
know how to assess your competition

924
01:14:13,494 --> 01:14:16,725
because you haven't competed.
Don't make me your competition.

925
01:14:19,534 --> 01:14:21,593
Now, I'll open up
a line of credit for you.

926
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:23,728
You'll be wanting a few toys.

927
01:14:41,422 --> 01:14:44,084
<i>Hotel rooms</i>
<i>were no longer an option.</i>

928
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:46,183
<i>What I needed was a bunker.</i>

929
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,694
<i>There's a built-in safe,</i>
<i>central surveillance,</i>

930
01:14:48,763 --> 01:14:51,323
<i>vault grade pneumatic doors.</i>

931
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:54,732
It's an unparalleled
three-tier security system.

932
01:14:54,802 --> 01:14:58,169
A fortress with a hell of a view.

933
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:05,174
- What's the asking price?
- Eight-point-five.

934
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:11,549
I'll take it.

935
01:15:17,191 --> 01:15:20,058
<i>Right away, it was obvious</i>
<i>he was on NZT.</i>

936
01:15:20,127 --> 01:15:22,789
Next week, I'm gonna need 20 pills.

937
01:15:22,863 --> 01:15:24,831
Next week, you can go fuck yourself!

938
01:15:24,899 --> 01:15:26,491
Not that you'd feel anything.

939
01:15:27,468 --> 01:15:31,131
I don't think your Fortune 500
financial friends would appreciate

940
01:15:31,205 --> 01:15:34,333
the details of your little dilemma
with the police.

941
01:15:35,309 --> 01:15:38,039
Thursday, I'm gonna need the pills here.

942
01:15:41,082 --> 01:15:42,515
Getting smarter!

943
01:15:44,385 --> 01:15:46,410
<i>Obviously, this could not go on,</i>

944
01:15:46,487 --> 01:15:49,650
<i>but there is very little on this earth</i>
<i>that 40 million dollars can't solve.</i>

945
01:15:49,724 --> 01:15:53,353
<i>And tomorrow at nine,</i>
<i>Atwood would sign the papers.</i>

946
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:03,693
- Do you want to call it?
- Cold feet?

947
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:06,331
There was all last night
to tell us that.

948
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:10,536
- Anything?
<i>- I'll call him again, sir.</i>

949
01:16:11,312 --> 01:16:13,545
OK, the decision could
have changed. That makes sense.

950
01:16:13,614 --> 01:16:16,481
The discourtesy doesn't.
It's still on.

951
01:16:17,818 --> 01:16:20,013
Oh, based on your charts
and projections.

952
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:23,183
You know, remind me,
who the fuck are you, anyway?

953
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:25,987
I'm sorry, Carl, I've had it with this
unqualified, posturing little prick.

954
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,187
- Pull it back.
- Since when is this the Delphic Oracle?

955
01:16:28,262 --> 01:16:32,130
- Pull it back.
- Excuse me, Mr. Van Loon?

956
01:16:32,199 --> 01:16:33,666
Mrs. Atwood is in your office.

957
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:39,004
Ah. Mrs. Atwood, Carl Van Loon.

958
01:16:39,073 --> 01:16:41,507
- My associate, Edward Morra.
- Pleasure.

959
01:16:43,944 --> 01:16:46,572
I wanted to make this
as confidential as possible.

960
01:16:46,647 --> 01:16:48,239
Of course.

961
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:52,218
My husband experienced some pain
and dizziness this morning.

962
01:16:52,286 --> 01:16:54,413
He's currently at Lenox Hill,
undergoing tests.

963
01:16:56,057 --> 01:16:58,016
I just want you to know
we have every intention

964
01:16:58,092 --> 01:16:59,389
of signing the contract.

965
01:17:00,094 --> 01:17:03,325
And as soon as he is able,
we will proceed.

966
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:07,434
I realize this is a useless platitude,
but if there's anything that we can do,

967
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:08,833
please don't hesitate to tell us.

968
01:17:08,903 --> 01:17:10,768
Obviously, we want to be
as helpful and respectful

969
01:17:10,838 --> 01:17:12,362
as possible, Mrs. Atwood.

970
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,238
Thank you, gentlemen.
I rely on your discretion.

971
01:17:17,312 --> 01:17:18,336
There won't be a proxy.

972
01:17:18,413 --> 01:17:21,473
No, a cagey prick like him
giving away power of attorney?

973
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,911
Well, he'd better get better.

974
01:17:31,059 --> 01:17:35,462
<i>But Atwood wouldn't get better.</i>
<i>Because Atwood was out of NZT.</i>

975
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,927
Well, why be surprised?

976
01:17:43,004 --> 01:17:46,440
<i>How many other meteoric rises</i>
<i>might be explained by NZT?</i>

977
01:17:46,507 --> 01:17:47,940
<i>At least I had some.</i>

978
01:17:48,009 --> 01:17:50,136
<i>- My life wasn't in jeopardy.</i>
- You can wait here.

979
01:17:50,211 --> 01:17:53,203
<i>Only my money. And my liberty.</i>

980
01:17:54,648 --> 01:17:56,047
I've been all over with them.

981
01:17:56,117 --> 01:17:58,483
We can't allow
any disparity in race

982
01:17:58,552 --> 01:18:01,316
or physical type between you
and the rest of the line up.

983
01:18:01,389 --> 01:18:02,378
OK.

984
01:18:02,456 --> 01:18:04,822
They're as close to your clones
as I could possibly get.

985
01:18:04,892 --> 01:18:08,658
<i>It's gotta be just one big</i>
<i>handsome blur to this guy.</i>

986
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,344
<i>Who was out there?</i>

987
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,980
<i>The woman's husband?</i>

988
01:18:28,783 --> 01:18:30,683
<i>A hotel maid?</i>

989
01:18:32,653 --> 01:18:35,144
<i>Was this how it was all going to end?</i>

990
01:18:39,493 --> 01:18:42,018
Not the dimmest clue.
He was dithering.

991
01:18:42,096 --> 01:18:45,065
"He was the third one from the right.
No. Not him."

992
01:18:45,132 --> 01:18:50,570
There you go. It's a thing of beauty.
You have that made?

993
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:52,230
I did.

994
01:19:09,056 --> 01:19:10,921
<i>... market's been mixed today.</i>

995
01:19:10,991 --> 01:19:13,687
<i>The Dow has been yo-yoing</i>
<i>amidst speculation that</i>

996
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:18,494
<i>Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood</i>
<i>have negotiated a merger...</i>

997
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,363
Have you been talking to anyone?

998
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:25,603
No, I haven't been talking to anybody,
Carl. I'm not stupid.

999
01:19:25,673 --> 01:19:26,901
I know you're not stupid, Eddie,

1000
01:19:26,974 --> 01:19:28,942
but don't make the classic
smart person's mistake.

1001
01:19:29,009 --> 01:19:30,874
Thinking no one's smarter than you.

1002
01:19:30,945 --> 01:19:34,108
Where the hell have you been? This is
the second time you've turned to vapor.

1003
01:19:34,181 --> 01:19:37,048
I was in the building, I was getting
coffee. Why, has there been movement?

1004
01:19:37,118 --> 01:19:39,450
Yeah, there's been movement alright.
Atwood's in a coma.

1005
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,045
He wasn't playing us.
He's dying.

1006
01:19:42,123 --> 01:19:43,715
What do you know about this?

1007
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:47,386
<i>I was less than</i>
<i>usually equipped to answer.</i>

1008
01:19:47,461 --> 01:19:51,830
<i>The dullness was coming on.</i>
<i>I was overdue to take my NZT.</i>

1009
01:19:51,899 --> 01:19:55,096
<i>And the pain was</i>
<i>starting behind my eyes.</i>

1010
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:56,431
Excuse me.

1011
01:19:56,504 --> 01:19:58,028
You're not excused.

1012
01:19:58,105 --> 01:20:00,630
What? A man in your employ
can't take a piss, Carl?

1013
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:25,230
<i>Was it Brandt or someone else?</i>

1014
01:20:25,299 --> 01:20:27,859
<i>The police station?</i>
<i>A coatroom?</i>

1015
01:20:41,882 --> 01:20:43,179
Mr. Morra.

1016
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,741
- Carl, I'm sorry...
- Mr. Morra. Mr. Morra!

1017
01:20:45,819 --> 01:20:47,582
- This just came for you.
- Yeah, what?

1018
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:56,095
Hope not, so let me know
when you know.

1019
01:20:56,163 --> 01:20:58,290
All right, I'm gonna ask you again,
Eddie. What do you know about this?

1020
01:20:58,865 --> 01:21:01,190
- What? About the leak?
- No. About Atwood.

1021
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,411
What? What about Atwood?

1022
01:21:03,482 --> 01:21:05,746
Look, you got a long way to go
as a liar, kiddo.

1023
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:07,045
- Carl, I don't know what you're...
- Listen!

1024
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:08,518
What you're about to say is bullshit.

1025
01:21:08,587 --> 01:21:10,077
I know there's something
you're hiding from me.

1026
01:21:10,155 --> 01:21:12,055
I smell it on you. Right now,

1027
01:21:12,124 --> 01:21:15,491
I wanna know why this clusterfuck
of a deal is dead in the water!

1028
01:21:17,195 --> 01:21:19,220
Carl.

1029
01:21:19,297 --> 01:21:21,288
Eddie! Eddie!

1030
01:21:37,883 --> 01:21:39,817
<i>Outside Lenox Hill Hospital today,</i>

1031
01:21:39,885 --> 01:21:42,649
<i>more twists and turns</i>
<i>in the Van Loon-Atwood merger.</i>

1032
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:46,555
<i>There is absolutely no truth</i>
<i>to the rumor of this merger.</i>

1033
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:50,322
<i>None whatsoever.</i>
<i>My husband is having tests.</i>

1034
01:21:50,395 --> 01:21:52,522
<i>This is a difficult time.</i>

1035
01:21:52,597 --> 01:21:56,499
<i>We would appreciate your directing</i>
<i>further questions to our attorney.</i>

1036
01:21:56,568 --> 01:21:59,036
<i>Yes, we have no further comments</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

1037
01:21:59,104 --> 01:22:01,504
<i>We're just awaiting the results</i>
<i>of the latest round of tests</i>

1038
01:22:01,573 --> 01:22:02,562
<i>and hoping for the best.</i>

1039
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,040
<i>Thank you.</i>

1040
01:22:43,234 --> 01:22:47,728
Eddie.
I know you're in there, Eddie.

1041
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:51,907
Open up.

1042
01:22:54,145 --> 01:22:56,204
Come on.

1043
01:22:58,483 --> 01:23:00,348
Open the door.

1044
01:23:17,068 --> 01:23:19,798
<i>And so, here I am.</i>

1045
01:23:22,607 --> 01:23:25,269
<i>I knew they would kill me</i>
<i>slowly and horribly.</i>

1046
01:23:25,343 --> 01:23:28,471
<i>But this choice</i>
<i>would at least be mine.</i>

1047
01:23:37,889 --> 01:23:42,258
<i>But we're instinctive creatures.</i>
<i>We want to live.</i>

1048
01:23:42,326 --> 01:23:46,820
<i>So my foggy brain tried to remember</i>
<i>where one tablet of NZT might be.</i>

1049
01:23:54,105 --> 01:23:58,872
<i>It was possible.</i>
<i>And possible was enough.</i>

1050
01:24:22,233 --> 01:24:23,825
Hey, Eddie.

1051
01:24:46,624 --> 01:24:49,593
Now you know I want more,
so why would you upset me?

1052
01:24:50,928 --> 01:24:53,522
I don't like being down
to this last one.

1053
01:24:53,598 --> 01:24:55,532
You don't even know how to use it.

1054
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,966
You don't appreciate it.

1055
01:24:58,035 --> 01:25:01,129
You see, I dissolve in a solution.

1056
01:25:01,205 --> 01:25:05,869
You shoot it. It goes straight
into the blood and brain.

1057
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:09,639
Lasts much longer.

1058
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:26,087
So...

1059
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,791
You gonna tell me where the rest is?

1060
01:25:28,866 --> 01:25:30,527
I'm plumb out.

1061
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:37,902
You know, these guys are gonna find it.

1062
01:25:39,076 --> 01:25:41,601
Or I'm gonna make you tell me.

1063
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,648
Question is, which is gonna come first?

1064
01:25:45,616 --> 01:25:47,709
I guess we're gonna find out, huh?

1065
01:25:51,422 --> 01:25:54,721
This is a waste of my time,
you know?

1066
01:25:54,792 --> 01:25:57,727
I'm getting out
of this side of the business.

1067
01:25:57,795 --> 01:26:02,494
I'm branching out.
I'm starting import-export company.

1068
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:04,527
Very exciting stuff.

1069
01:26:04,602 --> 01:26:08,197
I got a lot on my plate.
You're lucky I'm here.

1070
01:26:16,147 --> 01:26:21,744
Back in the old times, I might
peel your skin back. Fillet you.

1071
01:26:21,819 --> 01:26:24,583
"Fillet." It's a nice word.

1072
01:26:24,655 --> 01:26:29,354
I didn't know this before.
Oh, I had such a poor vocabulary.

1073
01:26:33,651 --> 01:26:35,915
But then I discovered
this thing, Google.

1074
01:26:36,982 --> 01:26:40,543
Did you know the small and large
intestines is 20 foot long?

1075
01:26:40,619 --> 01:26:42,450
I had no idea.
I don't believe it.

1076
01:26:42,521 --> 01:26:46,355
I gotta see this for myself.
I'm dubious. It's another nice word.

1077
01:26:46,424 --> 01:26:50,758
Anyway, I'm sure you're curious, too.

1078
01:26:50,829 --> 01:26:53,354
Don't worry, everything's sterilized.

1079
01:26:53,431 --> 01:26:56,491
We're gonna keep you alive
for the whole shebang.

1080
01:26:56,568 --> 01:26:58,695
You're gonna get
a front row seat, Eddie.

1081
01:27:01,173 --> 01:27:03,073
What?

1082
01:27:05,377 --> 01:27:07,641
Ah!

1083
01:27:36,141 --> 01:27:38,302
<i>Not much of a triumph, was it?</i>

1084
01:27:38,376 --> 01:27:40,571
<i>Because I would die here, too.</i>

1085
01:27:42,714 --> 01:27:47,014
<i>Only NZT could help me and the last of</i>
<i>it was in this fuck's blood stream.</i>

1086
01:29:02,727 --> 01:29:03,955
Victor!

1087
01:29:11,736 --> 01:29:13,363
What?

1088
01:29:20,979 --> 01:29:21,911
Ah!

1089
01:29:28,119 --> 01:29:28,813
Hey!

1090
01:29:30,388 --> 01:29:31,049
Ah!

1091
01:29:40,338 --> 01:29:42,169
Ah!

1092
01:30:22,647 --> 01:30:23,636
Victor?

1093
01:30:26,951 --> 01:30:28,145
Victor?

1094
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:30,651
Victor?

1095
01:31:20,571 --> 01:31:22,095
<i>The police would later note</i>

1096
01:31:22,172 --> 01:31:24,800
<i>that my apartment's previous</i>
<i>owner was an arms dealer.</i>

1097
01:31:24,875 --> 01:31:30,040
<i>Of course, these intruders had</i>
<i>been his dissatisfied clients.</i>

1098
01:31:30,114 --> 01:31:32,742
<i>And the night was still young.</i>

1099
01:31:45,229 --> 01:31:47,356
I'm sure you're curious
about what happened to your boss.

1100
01:31:47,431 --> 01:31:49,558
I know I certainly am.

1101
01:31:49,633 --> 01:31:52,500
I mean, if my attorney was
really working for Mr. Atwood,

1102
01:31:52,569 --> 01:31:56,835
trying to save his life,
why is he dead?

1103
01:31:56,907 --> 01:31:59,501
I mean, at what point was
the pony express supposed to ride in

1104
01:31:59,576 --> 01:32:01,669
with his life-saving medication?

1105
01:32:02,713 --> 01:32:04,738
<i>His boss was dead.</i>

1106
01:32:04,815 --> 01:32:08,945
<i>So, I didn't matter now.</i>

1107
01:32:09,019 --> 01:32:13,718
<i>But he did not appreciate that Morris</i>
<i>Brandt had kept the pills for himself.</i>

1108
01:32:25,703 --> 01:32:28,035
<i>And it was all still possible.</i>

1109
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:49,015
Actually, no, there's no more tickets.

1110
01:32:49,093 --> 01:32:53,553
Yeah, I know. An overbooked fundraiser.
That's a first.

1111
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:55,291
Well, here he comes. I'll ask him.

1112
01:32:56,033 --> 01:32:57,500
Oh, that's much better.

1113
01:32:57,568 --> 01:33:00,093
- Great job.
- Thank you, sir.

1114
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:01,330
Hi, Mr. Morra.

1115
01:33:01,405 --> 01:33:03,236
Edward!

1116
01:33:04,608 --> 01:33:06,872
I think we're looking
at a second overflow event.

1117
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,935
There's a wave of donations coming in
and I don't think

1118
01:33:09,013 --> 01:33:11,345
they're even gonna
try a second debate.

1119
01:33:11,415 --> 01:33:12,677
- Great.
- Hold on.

1120
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,377
A guy from
Eiben-Chemcorp's in your office.

1121
01:33:14,451 --> 01:33:16,214
- I have a lunch.
- They're your biggest contributor.

1122
01:33:16,286 --> 01:33:17,480
Give him his two crappy little minutes.

1123
01:33:17,554 --> 01:33:19,954
- Eiben-Chemcorp Pharmaceuticals?
- Yeah.

1124
01:33:21,825 --> 01:33:24,521
Finally get to meet the guys
that keep the lights on.

1125
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:27,827
- Carl!
- Mr. Morra.

1126
01:33:29,299 --> 01:33:32,791
What a surprise. They told me somebody
from Eiben was coming.

1127
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:36,237
Chemcorp. Yeah, that's me now. I'm
moving out of the energy business.

1128
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:40,037
Come on. That's like Hef
moving out of the mansion.

1129
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:43,341
Yeah. I bought Eiben a couple of months
ago. I'm surprised you didn't hear.

1130
01:33:43,414 --> 01:33:47,475
No. No. Well, they really
keep me hopping here.

1131
01:33:47,551 --> 01:33:50,349
Well, it's gonna pay off,
Senator Morra.

1132
01:33:51,688 --> 01:33:54,088
The Senate. Who knows...

1133
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:57,491
Everything's a technicality
from here on in, isn't it, Eddie?

1134
01:33:58,162 --> 01:34:02,724
I think we both know where it's headed,
if you can maintain.

1135
01:34:05,569 --> 01:34:08,766
Have you asked yourself what
you're gonna do when you run out?

1136
01:34:24,488 --> 01:34:27,480
- When did you know?
- Does it matter? I know now.

1137
01:34:28,559 --> 01:34:31,995
I wish you'd come to me at first, Eddie.
I could have bought Eiben at 33 a share.

1138
01:34:32,062 --> 01:34:33,495
We could have been partners.

1139
01:34:37,234 --> 01:34:39,099
So, Eiben makes NZT.

1140
01:34:39,169 --> 01:34:41,967
Well, it'll never officially exist.

1141
01:34:42,039 --> 01:34:44,564
Obviously, I don't need
to point out the advantages for you.

1142
01:34:45,509 --> 01:34:46,999
Oh, I think maybe you do.

1143
01:34:47,077 --> 01:34:51,013
Limitless supply.
We know you can't get any more.

1144
01:34:51,081 --> 01:34:52,605
You sure about that?

1145
01:34:52,683 --> 01:34:54,480
They shut down your lab this morning.

1146
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:00,547
Eddie. I just want to help you,
that's all.

1147
01:35:00,624 --> 01:35:03,616
Keep you supplied.
No disruption in service.

1148
01:35:03,694 --> 01:35:05,753
Give you peace of mind.
That's all.

1149
01:35:07,431 --> 01:35:10,423
And in return, I do what?

1150
01:35:10,501 --> 01:35:14,335
Get a little advice, maybe.
I won't be bothering you much at first.

1151
01:35:14,404 --> 01:35:16,872
And later. What are you
gonna be bothering me with?

1152
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:20,637
Well, given where you're heading,
some of our ideas are a bit ambitious.

1153
01:35:20,711 --> 01:35:22,576
But hey, I think they're achievable.

1154
01:35:22,646 --> 01:35:24,409
And what if I don't like your ideas?

1155
01:35:24,481 --> 01:35:26,881
Then we'll say, "Godspeed."

1156
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:30,442
And your candle will have shed a brief,
but lovely light.

1157
01:35:32,322 --> 01:35:33,812
But you know what, Eddie,
let's not even

1158
01:35:33,891 --> 01:35:34,880
go there right now.

1159
01:35:34,958 --> 01:35:38,257
Right now, I just want
to keep you brilliant...

1160
01:35:38,328 --> 01:35:42,059
...and healthy. Come on.
Let's go get some lunch.

1161
01:36:00,317 --> 01:36:02,285
After you, Senator.

1162
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,720
Thanks for stopping by, Carl.

1163
01:36:06,623 --> 01:36:08,386
Give us a second.

1164
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:11,154
What are you doing? Do you want
to be President of the United States

1165
01:36:11,228 --> 01:36:13,924
- or brain dead, stuck full of tubes?
- I'll take my chances.

1166
01:36:13,997 --> 01:36:17,228
I told you your chances don't exist.
We shut down your lab.

1167
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:18,495
You don't think some smartass on NZT

1168
01:36:18,569 --> 01:36:20,196
might have two or three
or even four labs?

1169
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:22,431
- So what? You're not making any more.
- That's right, I'm not.

1170
01:36:22,506 --> 01:36:24,565
I thought better of it.
See, once you know what's in it,

1171
01:36:24,641 --> 01:36:28,270
you can tweak it, re-engineer it.
Get the bugs out. Taper off.

1172
01:36:28,979 --> 01:36:30,310
I'm off it, Carl.

1173
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:31,642
Well, on it or off it,

1174
01:36:31,715 --> 01:36:34,013
there's no scenario
where you're not working for me.

1175
01:36:34,084 --> 01:36:35,608
How you gonna pay me?
In cigarettes?

1176
01:36:35,686 --> 01:36:36,846
Last year you traded

1177
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,888
- inside information 17 times.
- You threatening me?

1178
01:36:38,956 --> 01:36:42,016
Blank checks from Dubai.
Dumping in Chile. Disappeared officials.

1179
01:36:42,092 --> 01:36:44,185
- I mean, you shed a spot light...
- Do you want to go to war with me?

1180
01:36:44,261 --> 01:36:46,388
And trust me when I say this,
I'm not even being creative.

1181
01:36:46,463 --> 01:36:48,431
There's no way you can be making
accusations like that

1182
01:36:48,498 --> 01:36:50,830
and be walking around alive.

1183
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:53,495
That you would even think that shows me
how unprepared you are to fight me.

1184
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:55,128
- You're no longer equipped to fight me.
- I may be off it,

1185
01:36:55,205 --> 01:36:57,605
but you think I didn't learn anything?
That my synapses didn't change?

1186
01:36:57,674 --> 01:36:59,005
That I kept absolutely nothing?

1187
01:36:59,076 --> 01:37:00,668
You have no idea what
kind of enemy I can be.

1188
01:37:00,744 --> 01:37:03,611
- That van's gonna rear-end that taxi.
- What?

1189
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,342
The driver's distracted. He's texting.
He's going 30 miles an hour.

1190
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:08,213
He has 60 feet to stop.
He doesn't have room.

1191
01:37:08,285 --> 01:37:10,082
What van?

1192
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:14,789
I see everything, Carl.

1193
01:37:14,858 --> 01:37:17,156
I'm 50 moves ahead of you
and everybody else.

1194
01:37:17,227 --> 01:37:19,559
What makes you think I don't have a guy
with a bead on you right now?

1195
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:21,359
How do you know you're gonna be alive
this time next year?

1196
01:37:21,431 --> 01:37:24,594
What are you doing? You get
your hands off me. What are you doing?

1197
01:37:24,668 --> 01:37:27,432
Something's pumping half-mass in there.
The walls of your heart are dilated.

1198
01:37:27,504 --> 01:37:30,701
Your aortic valve's steno. So you're
gonna need to get that replaced.

1199
01:37:32,476 --> 01:37:34,103
But you already knew that.

1200
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:41,781
You know, you should
really be glad about this.

1201
01:37:41,852 --> 01:37:44,878
'Cause me working for you?
You'd end up as my bitch.

1202
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:59,597
Maybe we should cool off.
Talk again.

1203
01:38:01,438 --> 01:38:03,303
I don't think so.

1204
01:38:04,908 --> 01:38:06,136
Don't forget to vote.

1205
01:38:14,451 --> 01:38:15,884
Edward.

1206
01:38:15,952 --> 01:38:17,579
You good?

1207
01:38:17,654 --> 01:38:20,623
Yeah. Told you I have a lunch.

1208
01:38:26,563 --> 01:38:28,929
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey. Don't worry.

1209
01:38:31,001 --> 01:38:33,526
- How's your day going?
- Ah. I've had better.

1210
01:38:35,405 --> 01:38:37,396
I still can't deal with that haircut.

1211
01:38:37,474 --> 01:38:39,567
I wouldn't even
recognize you on the street.

1212
01:38:39,643 --> 01:38:41,406
Well, I'm a new man.

1213
01:38:42,713 --> 01:38:43,737
I've already ordered.

1214
01:38:59,663 --> 01:39:01,324
What?

1215
01:45:31,421 --> 01:45:32,410
ENGLISH US
