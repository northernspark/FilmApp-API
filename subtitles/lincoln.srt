00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,963
Some of us was
in the Second Kansas Colored.

3
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,588
We fought the Rebs at
Jenkins' Ferry last April

4
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,382
just after they killed every Negro soldier

5
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,217
they captured at Poison Springs.

6
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,012
So at Jenkins' Ferry,

7
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,764
we decided warn't takin'
no Reb prisoners.

8
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,517
And we didn't leave a one of 'em alive.

9
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,186
The ones of us that didn't die that day,

10
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:28,064
we joined up with
the 116th U.S. Colored, sir,

11
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,774
from Camp Nelson, Kentucky.

12
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,777
What's your name, soldier?

13
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,030
Private. Harold Green, sir.

14
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:38,074
I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir.

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,285
Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry.

16
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:42,454
We're waiting over there.

17
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,247
We're leaving our horses behind

18
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,915
and shipping out with the 24th Infantry

19
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,877
for the assault next week on Wilmington.

20
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,381
How long
have you been a soldier?

21
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,550
Two years, sir.

22
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,969
The Second Kansas
Colored Infantry,

23
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,388
they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry.

24
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:01,973
That's right, sir.

25
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,767
They killed
a thousand Rebel soldiers, sir.

26
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,685
They were very brave.

27
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,272
And making $3 less each month
than white soldiers.

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,607
Us Second Kansas boys...

29
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,985
Another $3 subtracted
from our pay for our uniforms.

30
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,528
That was true, yes sir,
but that's changed.

31
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,782
Equal pay now, but still
no commissioned Negro officers.

32
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,867
I'm aware of that,
Corporal Clark.

33
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,952
Yes, sir.
That's good that you're aware, sir...

34
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,287
Do you think the Wilmington attack...

35
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,915
Now that white people
have accustomed themselves

36
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,750
to seeing Negro men with guns

37
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,001
fighting on their behalf,

38
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,419
and now that they can tolerate

39
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,755
Negro soldiers getting equal pay

40
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,383
maybe in a few years,
they can abide the idea

41
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,760
of Negro lieutenants and captains.

42
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,471
In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel.

43
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,808
In a hundred years, the vote.

44
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:51,398
What will you do after the war,
Corporal Clark?

45
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,150
Work, sir.

46
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,028
- Hm.
- Perhaps you'll hire me.

47
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,655
Perhaps I will.

48
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,782
But you should know, sir,

49
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,992
that I get sick at the smell of boot black

50
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,994
and I cannot cut hair.

51
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,372
I've yet to find a man could cut mine

52
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,791
so that it'd make any difference.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,376
You got springy hair
for a white man.

54
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,710
Yes, I do.

55
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,046
My last barber hanged himself.

56
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,967
And the one before that.

57
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,718
Left me his scissors in his will.

58
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,348
President Lincoln, sir.

59
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,433
Good evening, boys.

60
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,101
We saw you, and...

61
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,019
- We were at...
- We was at Gettysburg.

62
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,771
You boys fight at Gettysburg?

63
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,982
No, didn't fight there,
we just signed up last month.

64
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,276
We saw him two years ago
at the cemetery dedication.

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,362
Yeah. We heard you speak...
...Goddamn.

66
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,989
Uh, hey, how tall are you, anyway?

67
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,407
Aw, jeez, shut up.

68
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,033
Could you hear what I said?

69
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,368
No, sir. Not much.

70
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:46,619
It was...

71
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,163
"Four score and seven years ago,

72
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,081
"our fathers brought forth
from this continent

73
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,624
"a new nation, conceived in liberty

74
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,917
"and dedicated to the proposition

75
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,586
"that all men are created equal."

76
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:56,671
That's good. Thank you.

77
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,548
"Now we are engaged
in a great civil war,

78
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,383
"testing whether that nation
or any nation

79
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:01,801
"so conceived and so dedicated,

80
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,052
"can long endure.

81
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,722
"We are met on a great
battlefield of that war."

82
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:07,557
That's good, thank you.

83
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,641
"We come to dedicate

84
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,893
"a portion of that field

85
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,561
"as a final resting place
for those who here

86
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,938
"gave their lives
that that nation might live."

87
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,066
His uncles, they died
on the second day of fighting.

88
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,651
I know the last part. It is, uh...

89
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,653
Company up! Moving out!

90
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,490
You boys best go
and find your company.

91
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,492
- And thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

92
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,577
- God bless you.
- God bless you, too.

93
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,162
God bless you.

94
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,844
"That we here highly resolve
that these dead

95
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,055
"shall not have died in vain.

96
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,016
"That this nation, under God,

97
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,560
"shall have a new birth of freedom

98
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,523
"and that government
of the people, by the people,

99
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,525
"for the people

100
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,110
"shall not perish from the earth."

101
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,057
It's nighttime.

102
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:34,978
Ship's moved by some terrible power

103
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,564
at a terrific speed.

104
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,400
And though it's imperceptible
in the darkness,

105
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,570
I have an intuition that
we're headed towards a shore.

106
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,447
No one else seems to be
aboard the vessel.

107
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:50,994
I'm very keenly aware of my aloneness.

108
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,955
"I could be bounded in a nutshell

109
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,916
"and count myself
a king of infinite space

110
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,377
"were it not that I have bad dreams."

111
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:01,671
Hmm.

112
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,590
I reckon it's the speed
that's strange to me.

113
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,301
I'm used to going at a deliberate pace.

114
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,179
I should spare you, Molly.

115
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,432
I shouldn't tell you my dreams.

116
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,184
I don't want to be spared if you aren't.

117
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,186
And you spare me nothing.

118
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:21,274
Perhaps it's...

119
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,819
It's the assault on Wilmington Port.

120
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,281
You dream about the ship
before a battle, usually.

121
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,575
How's the coconut?

122
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,411
Beyond description.

123
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,332
Almost two years, nothing mends.

124
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,668
Another casualty of the war.

125
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,173
Who wants to listen to a useless woman

126
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,258
grouse about her carriage accident?

127
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,968
- I do.
- Stuff.

128
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,971
You tell me dreams, that's all.

129
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,806
I'm your soothsayer.

130
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,642
That's all I am to you anymore.

131
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,685
I'm not to be trusted

132
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,773
even if it was not a carriage accident.

133
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,651
Even if it was
an attempted assassination.

134
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:05,943
It was most probably an accident.

135
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,572
It was an assassin
whose intended target was you.

136
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,619
How are the plans coming along
for the big shindy?

137
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,288
I don't want to talk about parties.

138
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,165
You don't care about parties.

139
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,669
Not much, but they're
a necessary hindrance.

140
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,425
I know.

141
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,054
I know what it's about, the ship.

142
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,560
It's not Wilmington Port.
It's not a military campaign.

143
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,981
It's the amendment to abolish slavery.

144
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:45,817
Why else would you force me

145
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,111
to invite demented radicals
into my home?

146
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,616
You're going to try to get
the amendment passed

147
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,326
in the House of Representatives

148
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,078
before the term ends?

149
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,413
Before the Inauguration?

150
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,998
Don't spend too much money
on the flubdubs.

151
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,753
No one is loved as much as you.

152
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,007
No one's ever been loved
so much by the people.

153
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,968
You might do anything now.

154
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,554
Don't... Don't waste that power

155
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,723
on an amendment bill
that's sure of defeat.

156
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,813
Did you remember Robert's
coming home for the reception?

157
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,565
Mm?

158
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,861
I knew you'd forget.

159
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,702
That's the ship you're sailing on,

160
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,829
the 13th Amendment.

161
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,999
You needn't tell me I'm right.
I know I am.

162
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,876
Oh!

163
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,420
Oh, it's late, Mrs. Keckley.

164
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,465
Well, she needs this
for the grand reception.

165
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,345
It's slow work.

166
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,265
Good night.

167
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,103
Did you tell her a dream?

168
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,407
- Papa.
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,784
Papa, I want to see Willie.

170
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,120
Me, too, Taddie, but we can't.

171
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,621
Why not?

172
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,998
Willie's gone.

173
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,375
It's three years now he's gone.

174
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,491
The part assigned to me
is to raise the flag.

175
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:28,539
Which, if there be no fault
in the machinery, I will do.

176
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,375
And when up

177
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,837
it'll be for the people to keep it up.

178
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,428
That's my speech.

179
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,558
We are coming, Father Abraham

180
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:50,144
Three hundred thousand more

181
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,480
From Mississippi's winding stream

182
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,815
And from New England's shore

183
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,943
We leave our plow and workshops

184
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,069
Our wives...

185
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,239
Even if every Republican
in the House votes yes,

186
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,076
far from guaranteed.
Since when has our party

187
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,411
unanimously supported anything?

188
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,248
But say all our fellow Republicans
vote for it.

189
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,168
We'd still be twenty votes short.

190
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,336
Only twenty?

191
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,504
"Only twenty?"

192
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,838
We can find twenty votes.

193
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,800
Twenty House Democrats
who'll vote to abolish slavery?

194
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,009
In my opinion...

195
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,095
To which I always listen.

196
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:27,098
- Or pretend to.
- With all three of my ears.

197
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,101
We'll win the war soon.

198
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,228
It's inevitable, isn't it?

199
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,563
Well, it ain't won yet.

200
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,401
You'll begin your second term
with semi-divine stature.

201
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,278
Imagine the possibilities
peace will bring.

202
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,406
Why tarnish your invaluable luster

203
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,699
with a battle in the House?

204
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,492
It's a rat's nest in there.

205
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,161
It's the same gang of
talentless hicks and hacks

206
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,580
who rejected the amendment
10 months ago.

207
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,040
We'll lose.

208
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,003
I like our chances now.

209
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,340
Well, consider the obstacles
that we'd face.

210
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,218
The aforementioned two-thirds majority

211
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,970
needed to pass an amendment.

212
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,390
We have a Republican majority,
but barely more than 50%.

213
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,808
Fifty-six.

214
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,855
We need Democratic support.
There's none to be had.

215
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,773
Since the House
last voted on the amendment,

216
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,233
there's been an election.

217
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,693
Sixty-four Democrats

218
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,195
lost their House seats in November.

219
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,781
That's 64 Democrats
looking for work come March.

220
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,949
I know.

221
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,534
They don't need to
worry about re-election.

222
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,994
They can vote however it suits them.

223
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,330
But we can't buy the vote
for the amendment.

224
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,374
It's too important.

225
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,585
I said nothing of buying anything.

226
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,004
We need twenty votes was all I said.

227
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:43,549
Start of my second term,
plenty of positions to fill.

228
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,971
Mr. President, may I present

229
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,140
Mr. and Mrs. Jolly
who've come from Missouri...

230
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,267
From Jeff City, President.

231
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,852
Mr. Jolly.

232
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,979
Ma'am.

233
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,857
And this here by the fire
is Secretary of State Seward.

234
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,570
Jeff City?

235
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,410
I heard tell once
of a Jefferson City lawyer

236
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,288
who had a parrot

237
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,916
that'd wake him
each morning, crying out,

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,543
"Today is the day the world shall end,

239
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,712
"as scripture has foretold."

240
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,590
And, uh, one day

241
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,593
the lawyer shot him,

242
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,763
for the sake of peace and quiet,
I presume.

243
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,599
Thus fulfilling, for the bird at least,

244
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,351
his prophecy.

245
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,821
There's only one toll booth in Jeff City,

246
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,447
to the southwest

247
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,075
and this man
Heinz Sauermagen from Rolla

248
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,369
been in illegal possession
for near two yar

249
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,704
since your man General Schofield

250
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,331
set him up there.

251
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,458
But President Monroe give that toll gate

252
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,835
to my granpap

253
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,711
and Quincy Adams

254
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,380
give my pap a letter

255
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,215
saying it's our'n for keeps.

256
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,175
Mrs. Jolly got the...

257
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,344
Show Mr. Lincoln
the Quincy Adams letter.

258
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,638
That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly.

259
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,806
Just tell me what you want from me.

260
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,395
Mr. Jolly's emphysema
don't care for cigars.

261
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,857
Madame, do you know
about the proposed

262
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:23,983
13th Amendment of the Constitution?

263
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,943
Yes, sir, everybody knows of it.

264
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,695
The President favors it.

265
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,321
- Do you?
- We do.

266
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,407
You know that it abolishes slavery?

267
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,658
Yes, sir, I know it.

268
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,952
And is that why you favor it?

269
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,330
What I favor is ending the war.

270
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,668
Once we do away with slavery,
the Rebs'll quit fighting

271
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,337
since slavery's what they're fighting for.

272
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,007
Mr. Lincoln, you always says so.

273
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,427
With the amendment, slavery's ended.

274
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,637
And they'll give up.
The war can finish then.

275
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,142
If the war finished first,
before we end slavery...

276
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,644
President Lincoln
says the war won't stop

277
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,730
unless we finish slavery.

278
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,857
But if it did.

279
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,859
The South is exhausted.

280
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:10,196
If they run out of bullets and men

281
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,365
would you still want your...

282
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,534
Who's your Representative?

283
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,078
Jeff City? That's Congressman Burton.

284
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,413
"Beanpole" Burton.

285
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,540
I mean, Josiah Burton, yes, sir.

286
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,666
A Republican,

287
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,836
undecided on the question
of the amendment, I believe.

288
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,546
Perhaps you could call on him

289
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,548
and inform him of your enthusiasm.

290
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,966
Yeah.

291
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,593
Madame.

292
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,554
If the Rebels surrendered next week

293
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,432
would you, at the end of this month

294
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,101
want Congressman Burton to vote

295
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,103
for the 13th Amendment?

296
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,859
If that was how it was,
no more war and all

297
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,237
I reckon Mr. Jolly
much prefer not to have

298
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,239
Congress pass the amendment.

299
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,116
Hmm. And, uh

300
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,869
why is that?

301
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,330
Niggers.

302
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,207
If he don't have to
let some Alabama coon

303
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,375
come up to Missouri

304
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,834
steal his chickens and his job,

305
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,753
we'd much prefer that.

306
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,465
The people.

307
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,884
I begin to see why
you're in such a great hurry

308
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,052
to put it through.

309
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,429
Would you let me study this letter, sir,

310
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,514
about the toll booth?

311
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,475
Come back to me in the morning

312
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,103
and we'll consider what the law says.

313
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,189
You be sure to

314
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,441
visit Beanpole.

315
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:33,570
Tell him that you support
passage of the amendment

316
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,739
as a military necessity.

317
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,741
Thank you.

318
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,954
Oh, Nicolay, when you have a moment.

319
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,618
If procuring votes

320
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,662
with offers of employment
is what you intend

321
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,997
I'll fetch a friend from Albany

322
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,874
who can supply the skulky men

323
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,084
gifted at this kind of shady work

324
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,461
and spare me the indignity

325
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,005
of actually speaking to Democrats.

326
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,632
Spare you the exposure and liability.

327
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,055
Pardon me, that's a distress signal

328
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:44,933
which I am bound,
by solemn oath, to respond to.

329
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,397
Tom Pendel took away
the glass camera plates

330
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,441
of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over

331
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,276
because Tom says Mama says
they're too distressing.

332
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,569
You had nightmares all night long.

333
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,446
I'll have worse nightmares
if you don't let me look

334
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,323
at the plates again.

335
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,867
Perhaps.

336
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,496
You can't afford a single defection

337
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,747
from anyone in the party.

338
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,375
Not even a single Republican
absent when they vote.

339
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,668
You know who you've got to see.

340
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,382
Send over to Blair House.

341
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,805
Ask Preston Blair
can I call on him around 5:00.

342
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,848
God help you.

343
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,893
God alone knows
what he'll ask you to give him.

344
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,355
If the Blairs tell them to,

345
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,857
no Republican will balk
at voting for the amendment.

346
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,527
No conservative Republican
is what you mean.

347
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,946
All Republicans
ought to be conservative.

348
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,406
I founded this party,

349
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,616
in my own goddamn home, to be a

350
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,035
conservative anti-slavery party,

351
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,329
not a hobbyhorse for
goddamn radical abolitionists.

352
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,206
Damp down the dyspepsia, Daddy.

353
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,083
You'll frighten the child.

354
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,127
You need us to keep
the conservative side

355
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,545
of the party in the traces

356
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,963
while you diddle the radicals

357
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,173
and bundle up
with Thaddeus Stevens's gang!

358
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,591
You need our help!

359
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,218
Yes, sir, I do.

360
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,886
Well, what do we get?

361
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,430
Whoa! Blunt!

362
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,724
Your manners, Monty,
must be why Mr. Lincoln

363
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,685
pushed you out of his Cabinet.

364
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,270
- I wasn't pushed!
- Oh, of course you weren't.

365
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,855
He was pushed out to
placate the damn radicals!

366
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:17,276
- I agreed to resign.
- Oh, Daddy, please! Daddy.

367
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,573
Oh. You don't mind, boy, do you?

368
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,741
He spends his days with soldiers.

369
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:25,826
They taught me a song.

370
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,369
Did they?

371
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,831
Soldiers know all manner of songs.

372
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,292
How's your brother Bob?

373
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,543
He's at school now, but he's coming

374
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,336
to visit in four days for the shindy.

375
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,547
At school. Ain't that fine?

376
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,424
Good he's not in the Army.

377
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,384
He wants to be,
but Mama said he cannot.

378
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,386
Dangerous life, soldiering.

379
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,389
Your mama is wise
to keep him clean out of that.

380
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,642
Now, your daddy knows that what I want

381
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,562
in return for all the help I can give him

382
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,440
is to go down to Richmond,
like he said I could

383
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,775
as soon as Savannah fell

384
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,320
and talk to Jefferson Davis.

385
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,281
Now give me terms
I can offer to Jefferson Davis

386
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,825
to start negotiating for peace.

387
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,076
He'll talk to me.

388
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,704
Conservative members of your party

389
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,416
want you to listen
to overtures from Richmond.

390
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,543
That above all!

391
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,506
They'll vote for this rash
and dangerous amendment

392
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,967
only if every other possibility
is exhausted.

393
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,095
Our Republicans ain't abolitionists.

394
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,682
We can't tell our people
they can vote yes

395
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,100
on abolishing slavery

396
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,229
unless at the same time we can tell them

397
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,232
that you're seeking a negotiated peace.

398
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,117
Leo, it's 100 miles to Richmond.

399
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,994
Get him drunk so he can sleep.

400
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,454
Yes, ma'am.

401
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:54,373
Here, Daddy.

402
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,874
Oh.

403
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,126
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir, all right.

404
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,836
Where's my hat?

405
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,547
Leo has your hat.

406
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,965
All right?

407
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,926
Go make peace.

408
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,440
Thunder forth, God of War.

409
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,988
We'll commence our assault
on Wilmington from the sea.

410
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,993
Why is this burnt?

411
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,495
Was the boy playing with it?

412
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,831
It got took by a breeze
several nights back.

413
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,583
This is an official War Department map.

414
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,501
And the entire Cabinet's waiting

415
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,669
to hear what it portends.

416
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:41,837
A bombardment.

417
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,257
From the largest fleet
the Navy has ever assembled.

418
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,759
Old Neptune, shake thy hoary locks!

419
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,845
Fifty-eight ships are under way,

420
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,264
of every tonnage and firing range.

421
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,683
We'll keep up
a steady barrage.

422
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,476
Our first target is Fort Fisher.

423
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,228
It defends Wilmington Port.

424
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,272
A steady barrage?

425
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,941
A hundred shells a minute.

426
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,068
Till they surrender.

427
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,154
Dear God.

428
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:10,616
Wilmington's
their last open seaport, therefore...

429
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,368
Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after.

430
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,122
And the war is done.

431
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,541
Hear, hear!

432
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,668
Then why, if I might ask

433
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,003
are we not concentrating

434
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,255
the nation's attention on Wilmington?

435
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,716
Why, instead, are we
reading in the Herald

436
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:29,760
that the anti-slavery amendment

437
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,888
is being precipitated onto
the House floor for debate?

438
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,056
Because your eagerness,

439
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,807
in what seems an unwarranted intrusion

440
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,477
of the executive into
legislative prerogatives,

441
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,395
is compelling it to what's...

442
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,482
To what's likely to be
its premature demise.

443
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,566
Hear, hear!

444
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,276
You signed
the Emancipation Proclamation.

445
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,361
You've done all that could be done.

446
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,654
The Emancipation Proclamation's

447
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,822
merely a war measure.
After the war, the courts...

448
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,658
When Edward Bates
was Attorney General,

449
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:53,950
he felt confident enough
to let you sign it!

450
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,078
Different lawyers, different opinions.

451
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,664
It frees slaves
as a military exigent. Not...

452
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,417
I don't recall Edward Bates
being any too certain about

453
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:05,253
the legality of my proclamation.

454
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,590
Just it wasn't downright criminal.

455
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,427
Somewheres in between.

456
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,971
Mm.

457
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,809
Back when I rode
the legal circuit in Illinois,

458
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,228
I defended a woman from Metamora

459
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,105
named Melissa Goings.

460
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,941
Seventy-seven years old.

461
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,778
They said she'd murdered
her husband. He was 83.

462
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,322
He was choking her

463
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,159
and she grabbed ahold
of a stick of firewood

464
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,870
and fractured his skull and he died.

465
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,832
In his will, he wrote,

466
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,294
"I expect she has killed me."

467
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,676
"If I get over it, I will have revenge."

468
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,058
No one was keen to see her convicted,

469
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,394
he was that kind of husband.

470
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,771
I asked the prosecuting attorney

471
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:08,066
if I might have a short conference
with my client.

472
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,403
She and I went into a room
in the courthouse,

473
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,363
but I alone emerged.

474
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,574
The window in the room
was found to be wide open.

475
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:19,244
It was believed the old lady
may have climbed out of it.

476
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,664
I told the bailiff,

477
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,541
right before I left her in the room

478
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,709
she asked me where she could get

479
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,628
a good drink of water,
and I told her, Tennessee.

480
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,050
Mrs. Goings was seen no more
in Metamora.

481
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,344
Enough justice had been done.

482
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:39,431
They even forgave
the bondsman her bail.

483
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,850
I'm afraid I don't see...

484
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,393
I decided

485
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:47,689
that the Constitution
gives me war powers

486
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,150
but no one knows just exactly

487
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,277
what those powers are.

488
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,321
Some say they don't exist.

489
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,072
I don't know. I decided

490
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,408
I needed them to exist to uphold my oath

491
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,744
to protect the Constitution.

492
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,704
Which I decided meant I could take

493
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,664
the Rebels' slaves from them

494
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,125
as property confiscated in war.

495
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,836
That might recommend
to suspicion that I agree

496
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,087
with the Rebs that their slaves

497
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,297
are property in the first place.

498
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,633
Of course, I don't. Never have.

499
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,594
I'm glad to see any man free,

500
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,888
and if calling a man property

501
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,264
or war contraband

502
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,601
does the trick,
why I caught at the opportunity.

503
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,230
Now here's where it gets truly slippery.

504
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,358
I use the law allowing for the seizure

505
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:32,526
of property in a war

506
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,069
knowing it applies only to the property

507
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,822
of governments and citizens
of belligerent nations.

508
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:39,241
Well, the South ain't a nation.

509
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:41,993
That's why I can't negotiate with them.

510
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,913
So if, in fact, the Negroes are property,

511
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,289
according to the law,

512
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,291
have I the right to take
the Rebels' property

513
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,210
from them, if I insist they're rebels only

514
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:53,255
and not citizens of a belligerent country?

515
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,006
And slipperier still, I maintain it ain't

516
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,926
our actual Southern states in rebellion

517
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,762
but only the rebels living in those states,

518
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:04,182
the laws of which states remain in force.

519
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,311
"The laws of which states
remain in force."

520
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,522
That means that since it's
states' laws that determine

521
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,066
whether Negroes can be sold as slaves,

522
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,651
as property,

523
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,487
the federal government
doesn't have a say in that.

524
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,197
At least not yet.

525
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:23,034
Then Negroes in those states
are slaves,

526
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,119
hence property,

527
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,371
hence my war powers
allow me to confiscate them

528
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,707
as such, so I confiscate them.

529
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,959
But if I'm a respecter of states' laws,

530
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,419
how then can I legally free them

531
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,796
with my Proclamation as I done?

532
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,049
Unless I'm canceling states' laws?

533
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,140
I felt the war demanded it.

534
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,809
My oath demanded it.

535
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,520
I felt right with myself,

536
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,898
and I hoped it was legal to do it.

537
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,649
I'm hoping still.

538
00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:00,405
Two years ago, I proclaimed
these people emancipated.

539
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,826
"Then, thenceforward and forever free."

540
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,288
Now let's say the courts
decide I had no authority

541
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,999
to do it. They might well decide that.

542
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,126
Say there's no amendment
abolishing slavery,

543
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,669
say it's after the war

544
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,713
and I can no longer use my war powers

545
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,590
to just ignore the courts' decisions

546
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,134
like I sometimes felt I had to do.

547
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,763
Might those people I freed
be ordered back into slavery?

548
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,893
That's why I'd like to get

549
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,978
the 13th Amendment through the House,

550
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,189
on its way to ratification by the states.

551
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,982
Wrap the whole slavery thing up,

552
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,860
forever and aye,
as soon as I'm able. Now!

553
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,403
End of this month.

554
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,197
And I'd like you to stand behind me

555
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,116
like my Cabinet's most always done.

556
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,210
As the preacher said,

557
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,254
"I could write shorter sermons,

558
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,257
"but once I start, I get too lazy to stop."

559
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,181
It seems to me, sir, you're describing

560
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,183
precisely the sort of dictator

561
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,060
the Democrats
have been howling about.

562
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,020
Dictators
aren't susceptible to law.

563
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,605
Neither is he.
He just said as much.

564
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,399
Ignoring the courts?
Twisting meanings?

565
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,401
What reins him in from... From...

566
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,987
Well, the people do that, I suppose.

567
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,699
I signed the Emancipation Proclamation,

568
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,785
what, a year and a half
before my second election?

569
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,662
I felt I was within my power to do it,

570
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:34,249
however, I also felt that
I might be wrong about that.

571
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,542
I knew the people would tell me.

572
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,293
I gave them a year and a half
to think about it,

573
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,712
and they re-elected me.

574
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,672
And come February the first,

575
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,591
I intend to sign the 13th Amendment!

576
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,188
Well, Mr. Representative Ashley.

577
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,357
Tell us the news from the Hill.

578
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:00,483
Ah, well, the news...

579
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,569
Why, for instance, is this thus,

580
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,487
and what is the reason
for this thusness?

581
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,198
James, we want you to bring
the anti-slavery amendment

582
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,283
to the floor for debate,

583
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,826
- immediately.
- Excuse me, what?

584
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,662
You are the amendment's manager,
are you not?

585
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,955
I am, of course, but...

586
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,833
Then we're counting
on robust radical support

587
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,585
so tell Mr. Stevens we expect him

588
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:19,919
to put his back into it.

589
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:21,087
It's not going to be easy, but...

590
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:22,797
It's impossible.

591
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,591
No. I am sorry, no.

592
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:28,011
We can't organize anything
immediately in the House.

593
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,596
I have been canvassing the Democrats

594
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,722
since the election,

595
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,265
in case any of them have softened

596
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,059
after they got walloped, but

597
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:35,894
they have stiffened,
if anything, Mr. Secretary.

598
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,103
There aren't nearly enough votes.

599
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:39,230
We're whalers, Mr. Ashley.

600
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:45,653
Whalers? As in, uh... Whales?

601
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,156
We've been chasing this whale
for a long time.

602
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,200
And we finally placed a harpoon

603
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,367
in the monster's back.

604
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,495
It's in, James. It's in.

605
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,164
We finish the deed now. We can't wait.

606
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,501
Or with one flop of his tail,
he'll smash the boat

607
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,711
and send us all to eternity.

608
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,130
On the 31 st of this month, of this year,

609
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:06,549
put the amendment up for a vote.

610
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,053
Whalers?

611
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,304
That's what he said.

612
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:14,057
The man's never been near
a whale ship in his life.

613
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,727
Withdraw radical support.

614
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,313
Force him to abandon this scheme,

615
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,190
whatever he's up to.

616
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,360
He drags his feet
about everything,

617
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,529
Lincoln... Why this urgency?

618
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,614
We got it through the Senate
without difficulty

619
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,907
because we had the numbers.

620
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,535
Come December, you'll have
the same in the House.

621
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,537
The amendment will be
the easy work of 10 minutes.

622
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,122
He's using the threat of the amendment

623
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,957
to frighten the Rebels
into an immediate surrender.

624
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,042
I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.

625
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,086
Will you rejoice
when the Southern states

626
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,838
have rejoined the Union pell-mell,

627
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,881
as Lincoln intends them to,
and one by one,

628
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,299
each refuses to ratify the amendment?

629
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,552
If we pass it, which we won't.

630
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,888
Why are we cooperating with him?

631
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,475
We all know what he's doing
and we all know what he'll do.

632
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,728
We can't offer up abolition's
best legal prayer

633
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,272
to his games and tricks.

634
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:03,857
He said he'd welcome the South back

635
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,150
with all its slaves in chains.

636
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,610
Three years ago he said that,
to calm the border states.

637
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,279
I don't!

638
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,200
You said we all know
what he'll do. I don't know.

639
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:15,577
You know he isn't to be trusted.

640
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,995
Trust? Oh.

641
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,705
I'm sorry, I was under
the misapprehension

642
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:21,499
that your chosen profession was politics.

643
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,960
I never trusted the President,
never trusted anyone,

644
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,795
but hasn't he surprised you?

645
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,047
No, Mr. Stevens, he hasn't.

646
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,592
Nothing surprises you, Asa,

647
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,136
therefore nothing about you
is surprising.

648
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:35,013
Perhaps that is why your constituents

649
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,765
did not re-elect you to the coming term.

650
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,476
It's late.

651
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:41,811
I'm old.

652
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,439
I'm going home.

653
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,612
Lincoln, the inveterate dawdler.

654
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,864
Lincoln, the Southerner.

655
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,950
Lincoln, the capitulating compromiser,

656
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,454
our adversary, and

657
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,042
leader of the godforsaken
Republican party.

658
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,335
Our party.

659
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:08,838
Abraham Lincoln has asked us
to work with him

660
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,467
to accomplish the death
of slavery in America.

661
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,054
Retain, even in opposition

662
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,849
your capacity for astonishment.

663
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,608
The President is never
to be mentioned. Nor I.

664
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,318
You're paid for your discretion.

665
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,278
Hell, you can have that for nothing.

666
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:35,073
What we need money for
is bribes, to speed things up.

667
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,950
No, nothing strictly illegal.

668
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,743
It's not illegal to bribe Congressmen,

669
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,245
they'd starve otherwise.

670
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:43,831
I have explained to Mr. Bilbo
and Mr. Latham that

671
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,625
we are offering patronage jobs

672
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:46,834
to the Dems who vote yes.

673
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,671
- Jobs and nothing more.
- That's correct.

674
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,880
Congressmen come cheap.

675
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,174
Few thousand bucks
will buy you all you need.

676
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,551
The President would be unhappy
to hear you did that.

677
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:58,054
Will he be unhappy if we lose?

678
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,640
The money I managed to raise
for this endeavor

679
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,393
is only for your fees,
your food and lodging.

680
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,186
Uh-huh.

681
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,480
If that squirrel-infested attic

682
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,898
you've quartered us in is any measure,

683
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,650
you ain't raised much.

684
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:11,859
Shall we get to work?

685
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,032
The House recognizes Fernando Wood,

686
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,537
the honorable Representative
from New York.

687
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,750
Estimable colleagues.

688
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,296
Two bloody years ago this month

689
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,214
His Highness,

690
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,717
King Abraham Africanus the First,

691
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,554
our great usurping Caesar,

692
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,308
violator of habeas corpus
and freedom of the press,

693
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,434
abuser of states' rights...

694
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,437
If Lincoln really were a tyrant, Mr. Wood,

695
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,397
he'd have had your empty head

696
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,149
impaled on a pike!

697
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,029
And the country better for it!

698
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,740
Radical Republican autocrat,

699
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:02,076
ruling by fiat and martial law,

700
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,413
affixed his name to his heinous and illicit

701
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,623
Emancipation Proclamation

702
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,835
promising it would hasten
the end of the war,

703
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,255
which yet rages on and on.

704
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,967
He claimed, as tyrants do

705
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,178
that the war's emergencies

706
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,764
permitted him to turn our army into...

707
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,601
The New York delegation is
looking decidedly uninspired.

708
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,313
...and radical Republicanism's
abolitionist fanaticism!

709
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,694
His Emancipation Proclamation

710
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,697
has obliterated millions of dollars...

711
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,742
Over in Pennsylvania,

712
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,286
who's the sweaty man eating his thumb?

713
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,789
Unknown to me.
Seems jumpy.

714
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,041
Perhaps he'll jump.

715
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:57,048
But all that was not enough
for this dictator,

716
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,342
who now seeks to insinuate...

717
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,635
Jesus.

718
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,845
When's this son of liberty
sum-a-bitch gonna sit down?

719
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,972
John Ellis is gonna break
his watch if he doesn't stop.

720
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:09,227
We are once again asked, nay

721
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:12,730
commanded, to consider
a proposed 13th Amendment

722
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,609
which, if passed,
shall set at immediate liberty

723
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,444
four million coloreds while manacling

724
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:20,863
the limbs of the white race in America.

725
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,657
If it is passed,

726
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:25,034
but it shall not pass!

727
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:31,791
What's more interesting

728
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,875
is how dismal and disgruntled

729
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:34,335
Mr. Yeaman appears.

730
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,338
Every member of this House...

731
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:38,714
He should be cheering right now.

732
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:40,341
Looks like he ate a bad oyster.

733
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,593
...Party and
the constituents it serves

734
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:43,845
shall oppose...

735
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,306
Point of order,
Mr. Speaker, if you please.

736
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,142
Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor.

737
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,309
And the gentleman from Pennsylvania

738
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,644
is out of order!

739
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,604
When will Mr. Wood conclude
his interminable gabble?

740
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,857
Some of us breathe oxygen

741
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,152
and we find the mephitic
fumes of his oratory

742
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:02,530
a lethal challenge
to our pulmonary capabilities!

743
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,202
We shall oppose this amendment,

744
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,872
and any legislation that
so affronts natural law

745
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,541
insulting to God as to man!

746
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,043
Congress must never declare equal

747
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,379
those whom God created unequal!

748
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,679
Slavery is the only insult to natural law,

749
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,556
you fatuous nincompoop!

750
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,477
Order!

751
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,480
Procedure, Mr. Speaker.

752
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,190
Mr. Wood has the floor.

753
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,649
Instruct us,

754
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,234
oh, Great Commoner.

755
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,737
What is unnatural, in your opinion?

756
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,114
Niggrahs casting ballots?

757
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,782
Niggrah representatives?

758
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,910
Is that natural, Stevens?

759
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,828
Intermarriage?

760
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,123
What violates natural law?

761
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,834
Slavery and you.

762
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:59,921
Pendleton, you insult God!

763
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:03,174
You unnatural noise.

764
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,431
Mr. Colfax, please, use your gavel!

765
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,058
- You are out of order!
- Order in the Cabinet!

766
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:13,142
Instruct the Sergeant-at-Arms

767
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:14,227
to suppress this!

768
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:15,436
We are in session!

769
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,522
Please don't encourage this!

770
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,232
Don't encourage this!

771
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,239
You're back! You're back! You're back!

772
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,408
I am. The goat got big.

773
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,953
Help me get one of these to my room.

774
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,913
- She in there?
- She's asleep, probably.

775
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,498
- You need help, sir?
- No, sir.

776
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:36,582
They went to see Avonia Jones last night

777
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:37,875
in a play about Israelites.

778
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,710
Could you bring your pa this letter I writ

779
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:40,962
about my insolvency proceeding?

780
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,214
Deliver your own goddamn petition.

781
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,423
There's a new book. Sam Beckwith

782
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:45,800
says it's about finches
and finches' beaks,

783
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:46,926
about how they change.

784
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:48,553
He's here.

785
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:51,138
He's here! Mrs. Cuthbert, he's here!

786
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,099
- Robbie.
- Hi, Mom.

787
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,517
- Oh, Robbie.
- Hey.

788
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,810
- Robbie.
- Hey.

789
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,311
Oh.

790
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,191
You're only staying a few days,
why'd you pack all that?

791
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,901
Well, I don't know how long...

792
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,152
Go tell your father Robert's home.

793
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:08,239
Mr. Nicolay says Daddy's
secluded with Mr. Blair.

794
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,949
Tell him anyway.

795
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:13,995
Did you forget to eat?

796
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,788
- Exactly like him.
- No.

797
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,874
You'll linger a few days extra
after the reception

798
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,543
before you go back to school.

799
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,670
Well, I don't know
if I'm going to go back...

800
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:26,007
We'll fatten you up
before you return to Boston.

801
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,051
- All right, Mom.
- All right.

802
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,762
Oh, Robbie.

803
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,349
Jefferson Davis is sending
three delegates.

804
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,852
Stephens, Hunter and Campbell.

805
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,272
Vice President of the Confederacy,

806
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,149
the former Secretary of State

807
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,818
and their Assistant Secretary of War.

808
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,030
They're coming in earnest
to propose peace.

809
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:53,826
I know this is unwelcome news for you.

810
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:55,703
Now hear me.

811
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,749
I went to Richmond to talk to traitors.

812
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,419
To smile at and plead with traitors

813
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,340
because it'll be spring in two months.

814
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:09,842
The roads will be passable,

815
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,219
the spring slaughter commences.

816
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,222
Four bloody springs now.

817
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,893
Think of my Frank,

818
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,729
whom you've taken to your heart.

819
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:24,690
How you'll blame yourself
if the war takes my son

820
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:27,276
as it's taken multitudes of sons.

821
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,322
Think of all the boys who will die

822
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,366
if you don't make peace.

823
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,368
You must talk with these men.

824
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,827
I intend to, Preston.

825
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,996
In return, I must ask you to support
our push for the amendment...

826
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,665
No, this is not horse trading.

827
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:42,917
Not now!

828
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,419
Bob. I'm sorry.

829
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,380
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, sir.

830
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,590
Looking fit, Robert.
Harvard agrees with you.

831
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:50,925
- Mr. Blair.
- Fit and rested.

832
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:53,969
Could you give us a moment,
please, Robert? Thank you.

833
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:58,808
I will procure your votes for you,
as I promised.

834
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:03,062
You have always kept your word to me.

835
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:06,440
Those Southern men are coming.

836
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,111
I beg you, in the name
of gentle Christ, sir.

837
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,237
I understand.

838
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,030
Talk peace with these men.

839
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:14,949
I understand, Preston.

840
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,412
We have
one abstention so far.

841
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:20,621
Jacob Graylor.

842
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,748
He'd like to be
Federal Revenue Assessor

843
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,583
for the 5th District of Pennsylvania.

844
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,836
So the total of Representatives

845
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:30,047
voting three weeks from today
is reduced to 182,

846
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:32,049
which means 122 yes votes

847
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:34,135
to reach the requisite
two-thirds of the House.

848
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:36,929
Assuming all Republicans
vote for the amendment.

849
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,726
Then despite our abstention,

850
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,394
to reach a two-thirds majority,

851
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,229
we remain twenty yeses short.

852
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,355
For which we're seeking

853
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,983
from among 64 lame duck Democrats.

854
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:53,654
Fully 39 of these we deem
unredeemable no votes.

855
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,992
The kind that hates niggers.

856
00:42:58,452 --> 00:43:00,661
Hates God for makin' niggers.

857
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,748
The Good Lord on high
would despair of their souls.

858
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,959
Thank you for that
pithy explanation, Mr. Bilbo.

859
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,753
We've abandoned these 39 to

860
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,504
the devil that possesses them.

861
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:11,589
We would...

862
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:16,427
The remaining lame ducks, on whom
we've been working with a purpose.

863
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,429
Charles Hanson.

864
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,181
Congressman.

865
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,601
My colleagues and I would like
a moment of your time.

866
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,478
I wonder if you've given much thought...

867
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,354
Giles Stuart.

868
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,195
Rather clumsy.

869
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,292
Nelson Merrick.

870
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:55,883
Homer Benson.

871
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,557
My name is Richard Schell.

872
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:06,060
I wanted you to have a look
at this prospectus here.

873
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,063
And lastly,

874
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,150
Clay Hawkins. Of Ohio.

875
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:16,153
Tax Collector for the Western Reserve.

876
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:17,822
That pays handsomely.

877
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,657
Don't just reach
for the highest branches,

878
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,575
they sway in every breeze.

879
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,078
Assistant Port Inspector in Morristown

880
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,663
looks like the ticket to me.

881
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,581
Boats, they, they make me sick.

882
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,708
So just stand on the dock.

883
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,586
Let the Assistant Assistant
Port Inspector's stomach

884
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,004
go weak.

885
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,925
And, lastly,
Democratic yes vote

886
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,927
number six, Hawkins.

887
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,011
From Ohio.

888
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,179
Six?

889
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:43,848
Well, thus far.

890
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:46,058
Plus Graylor's abstention.

891
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,936
- From tiny acorns and so on.
- What did Hawkins get?

892
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,188
Postmaster of the Millersburg
Post Office.

893
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,606
He's selling himself cheap, ain't he?

894
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,942
Well, he wanted Tax Collector
of the Western Reserve.

895
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,111
First term Congressman
who couldn't manage reelection.

896
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,279
I felt it unseemly

897
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,864
and they bargained him down
to Postmaster.

898
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:01,365
Scatter them over several
rounds of appointments

899
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,867
so no one notices, then burn this ledger,

900
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,035
please, after you're done.

901
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,374
Time for my public opinion bath.

902
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,792
Might as well let them in.

903
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,921
Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis.

904
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,465
Thirteen to go.

905
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:21,135
One last item.

906
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,429
An absurdity, but

907
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,807
my associates report that
among the Representatives

908
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,476
a fantastical rumor's bruited about,

909
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,438
which I immediately disavowed,

910
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,899
that you'd allowed
bleary old Preston Blair

911
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,066
to sojourn to Richmond

912
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:38,235
to invite Jeff Davis
to send commissioners

913
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,905
up to Washington with a peace plan.

914
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,244
I, of course, told them
that you would never.

915
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:50,164
Not without consulting me, you wouldn't.

916
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:53,167
Because why on earth would you?

917
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,255
Much obliged.

918
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,346
Why wasn't I consulted?

919
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:30,931
I'm Secretary of State.

920
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,601
And you informally send
a reactionary dotard to...

921
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,438
What will happen, do you imagine,

922
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:40,107
when these
peace commissioners arrive?

923
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,275
We'll hear them out.

924
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,027
Oh. Splendid.

925
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:44,695
And next, the Democrats will invite them

926
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,280
up to hearings on the Hill.

927
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:48,949
And the newspapers...
Oh, the newspapers.

928
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,451
The newspapers will ask,

929
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,369
"Why risk enraging the Confederacy

930
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:53,454
"over the issue of slavery

931
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,914
"when they're here to make peace?"

932
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,960
We'll lose every Democrat we've got,

933
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:01,628
more than likely
conservative Republicans

934
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,297
will join them, and all our work,

935
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,716
all our preparing the ground for the vote

936
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,967
laid waste for naught.

937
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:08,802
The Blairs promised support
for the amendment

938
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:09,887
if we listen to these people.

939
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,805
Oh, the Blairs promise, do they?

940
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:12,973
You think they'll keep their promise

941
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,141
once we've heard these delegates

942
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,143
and refused them,
which we will have to do,

943
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,728
since their proposal most certainly

944
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,146
will be predicated on

945
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,814
keeping their slaves!

946
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:23,442
What hope for
any Democratic votes, Willum,

947
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,736
if word gets out that
I've refused a chance

948
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,488
to end the war?

949
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,740
You think word won't get out?

950
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,242
In Washington?

951
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:35,996
It's either the amendment
or this Confederate peace.

952
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,915
You cannot have both.

953
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:41,335
"If you can look into the seeds of time,

954
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,255
"And say which grain will grow
and which will not,

955
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,507
"Speak then to me."

956
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,175
A disaster. This is a disaster.

957
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,594
Time is a great thickener
of things, Willum.

958
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,471
Yes, I suppose it is.

959
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,015
Actually, I have no idea
what you mean by that.

960
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:59,019
Get me 13 votes.

961
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,314
Them fellas from Richmond
ain't here yet.

962
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,879
You drafted
half the men in Boston.

963
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:28,799
What do you think
their families think about me?

964
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,801
The only reason they don't
throw things and spit on me

965
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,386
is 'cause you're so popular.

966
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,223
I can't concentrate on,
on British Mercantile Law.

967
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,475
I don't care about British Mercantile Law.

968
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,354
I might not even want to be a lawyer.

969
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:47,484
It's a sturdy profession.
And a useful one.

970
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:52,573
Yes, and I want to be useful,
but now, not afterwards.

971
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,408
I ain't wearing them things, Mr. Slade.

972
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,492
They never fit right.

973
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:57,828
The missus will have you
wear them. Don't think...

974
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,830
You're delaying,
that's your favorite tactic.

975
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:01,832
- Be useful...
- You won't tell me no,

976
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,750
but the war will be over in
a month, and you know it will.

977
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:06,503
I've found that prophesying

978
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,091
is one of life's
less profitable occupations.

979
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:15,012
Why do some slaves
cost more than others?

980
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,430
Uh, if they're still young and healthy,

981
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,098
or if the women can
still conceive, they pay more.

982
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:20,851
Put them back in the box, you scoundrel.

983
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,188
We'll return them to Mr. Gardner's studio

984
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:25,772
day after next.

985
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,609
Be careful with them now.

986
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:31,195
These things should have
stayed on the calf.

987
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:35,699
When you were a slave,
Mr. Slade, did they beat you?

988
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,284
I was born a free man.

989
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,204
Nobody beat me
except I beat them right back.

990
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,373
Mr. Lincoln...

991
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:47,377
Mrs. Keckley was a slave.
Ask her if she was beaten.

992
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:49,296
- Were you...
- Tad.

993
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:50,881
I was beaten
with a fire shovel

994
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,216
when I was younger than you.

995
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,135
You should go to Mrs. Lincoln.
She's in Willie's room.

996
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,471
She never goes in there.

997
00:50:57,597 --> 00:51:00,974
The reception line is already
stretching out the door.

998
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:05,896
See, I'll be the only man
over 15 and under 65

999
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,065
in this whole place not in uniform.

1000
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:09,608
I'm under 15.

1001
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,297
My head hurts so.

1002
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,512
I prayed for death the night Willie died.

1003
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:42,849
My headaches are how I know
I didn't get my wish.

1004
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:48,855
How to endure the long afternoon

1005
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,357
and deep into the night.

1006
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:51,692
I know.

1007
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,945
Trying not to think about him.
How will I manage?

1008
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,863
- Somehow. You will.
- Somehow?

1009
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,990
Oh.

1010
00:51:58,074 --> 00:52:00,117
Somehow. Somehow.

1011
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,787
Every party.

1012
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,706
Every...

1013
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,127
And now

1014
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:14,381
four years more in this terrible house,

1015
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,300
reproaching us.

1016
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:19,970
He was a very sick little boy.

1017
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,472
We should have canceled
that reception, shouldn't we?

1018
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:23,974
We didn't know how sick he was.

1019
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,642
I knew. I knew.

1020
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:29,062
I saw that night
...he was dying.

1021
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:32,566
Three years ago,
the war was going so badly.

1022
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,402
We had to put on a face.

1023
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,987
But I saw Willie was dying.

1024
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:38,655
Molly...

1025
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,490
I saw him.

1026
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,411
It's too hard.

1027
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:51,752
Too hard.

1028
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,178
Oh, gracious saints!

1029
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,777
She's just ten feet yonder.
I'd like to keep my job.

1030
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,195
- How nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1031
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:21,782
Senator Sumner.
It's been much too long.

1032
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,533
"Oh, who can look
on that celestial face..."

1033
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,618
And?

1034
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,203
James Ashley, ma'am.
We've met several times.

1035
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,954
Praise heavens, praise heavens.

1036
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:30,290
Just when I had abandoned
hope of amusement,

1037
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,625
it's the Chairman of the House Ways

1038
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,627
- and Means Committee.
- Mrs. Lincoln.

1039
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:36,380
Madame President, if you please.

1040
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,217
Don't convene another subcommittee

1041
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,385
to investigate me, sir.

1042
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,303
I'm teasing. Smile, Senator Wade.

1043
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,305
I believe I am smiling, Mrs. Lincoln.

1044
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,556
As long as your household accounts

1045
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:48,475
are in order, madam,

1046
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,894
we'll have no need to investigate them.

1047
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,897
You have always taken such a lively,

1048
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:57,818
even prosecutorial interest
in my household accounts.

1049
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,570
Your household accounts have
always been so interesting.

1050
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:02,656
Yes, thank you. It's true.

1051
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,659
The miracles I have wrought

1052
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:08,245
out of fertilizer bills
and cutlery invoices,

1053
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:09,955
but I had to.

1054
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,166
Four years ago, when
the President and I arrived,

1055
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:14,751
this was pure pigsty.

1056
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,753
Tobacco stains on the Turkey carpets.

1057
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:20,424
Mushrooms, green as the moon,
sprouting from the ceilings.

1058
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:23,760
And a pauper's pittance
allotted for improvements.

1059
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:26,847
As if your committee joined
with all of Washington

1060
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,432
awaiting in what you anticipated

1061
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,976
would be our comfort in squalor.

1062
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:33,770
Further proof that my husband and I

1063
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:35,522
were prairie primitives

1064
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:38,692
unsuited to the position to
which an error of the people,

1065
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:42,279
a flaw in the Democratic
process had elevated us.

1066
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:45,282
The past is the past. It's a new year now

1067
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:49,536
and we are all getting along,
or so they tell me.

1068
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,788
I gather we are working together.

1069
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:53,874
The White House and the other House,

1070
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,208
hatching little plans together.

1071
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:56,376
- Mother.
- What?

1072
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,545
- You're creating a bottleneck.
- Oh.

1073
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,505
Oh, I'm detaining you.

1074
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:04,050
And more importantly,
the people behind you.

1075
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:07,471
How the people love my husband.

1076
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:12,058
They flock to see him by
their thousands on public days.

1077
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,562
They will never love you
the way they love him.

1078
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:19,816
How difficult it must be
for you to know that

1079
00:55:19,901 --> 00:55:22,569
and yet how important to remember it.

1080
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:35,999
Since we have the floor
next in the debate,

1081
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,418
I thought I'd suggest you might

1082
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,004
temper your contribution

1083
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,090
so as not to frighten
our conservative friends.

1084
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,259
Ashley insists you're ensuring approval

1085
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,261
by dispensing patronage

1086
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:51,014
to otherwise undeserving Democrats.

1087
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,933
I can't ensure a single damn thing

1088
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:54,684
if you scare the whole House silly

1089
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,520
with talk of land appropriations

1090
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,522
and revolutionary tribunals.

1091
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:01,024
When the war ends, I intend to

1092
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:05,904
push for full equality,
the Negro vote, and much more.

1093
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:08,323
Congress shall mandate the seizure

1094
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,950
of every foot of Rebel land

1095
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:12,619
and every dollar of their property.

1096
00:56:13,955 --> 00:56:15,497
We'll use their confiscated wealth

1097
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:17,541
to establish hundreds of thousands

1098
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,167
of free Negro farmers

1099
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,920
and, at their side,
soldiers armed to occupy

1100
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,630
and transform the heritage of traitors.

1101
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:26,716
We'll build up a land down there

1102
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:29,970
of free men and free women
and free children and freedom.

1103
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,808
The nation needs to know
that we have such plans.

1104
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:38,520
That's the untempered version
of reconstruction.

1105
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:42,315
It is not...

1106
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,985
It's not quite exactly what I intend.

1107
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,699
But we shall oppose one another
in the course of time.

1108
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,867
Now we're working together,
and I'm asking you...

1109
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:54,202
For patience, I expect.

1110
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,037
When the people disagree,
bringing them together

1111
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,665
requires going slow
until they're ready to...

1112
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,834
Shit on the people and what they want

1113
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,918
and what they're ready for.

1114
00:57:02,003 --> 00:57:03,211
I don't give a goddamn about the people

1115
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,546
and what they want.

1116
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:05,797
This is the face of someone

1117
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,257
who has fought long and hard

1118
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,466
for the good of the people

1119
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:11,219
without caring much for any of them.

1120
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,054
And I look a lot worse without my wig.

1121
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:17,851
The people elected me
to represent them,

1122
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:20,645
to lead them, and I lead.
You ought to try it.

1123
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,484
I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens

1124
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:30,363
and I have tried to profit
from the example of it, but

1125
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,407
if I'd listened to you,

1126
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:33,867
I'd have declared every slave free

1127
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:36,494
the minute the first shell
struck Fort Sumter.

1128
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:38,121
And the border states
would have gone over

1129
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,373
to the Confederacy,
the war would have been lost

1130
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,875
and the Union along with it,

1131
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:43,918
and instead of abolishing slavery

1132
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,712
as we hope to do in two weeks,

1133
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,381
we'd be watching,
helpless as infants, as it spread

1134
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,592
from the American South
into South America.

1135
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:53,511
Oh, how you have longed
to say that to me.

1136
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,097
You claim you trust them,

1137
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,558
but you know what the people are.

1138
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:02,145
You know that the inner compass,

1139
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,731
that should direct the soul
towards justice

1140
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:08,443
has ossified in white men
and women, North and South,

1141
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,320
unto utter uselessness,

1142
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,614
through tolerating the evil of slavery.

1143
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,783
White people cannot bear the thought

1144
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,743
of sharing this country's
infinite abundance

1145
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:18,411
with Negroes.

1146
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:23,750
A compass, I learned
when I was surveying,

1147
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,587
it'll point you true north
from where you're standing.

1148
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,506
But it's got no advice about

1149
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,217
the swamps and deserts and chasms

1150
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,844
that you'll encounter along the way.

1151
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:36,346
If in pursuit of your destination,

1152
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,348
you plunge ahead,
heedless of obstacles

1153
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,893
and achieve nothing more
than to sink in a swamp,

1154
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,647
what's the use of knowing true north?

1155
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:05,291
Robert's going to plead
with us to let him enlist.

1156
00:59:07,837 --> 00:59:11,965
Make time to talk to Robbie.
You only have time for Tad.

1157
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,508
Tad is young.

1158
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:17,721
So is Robert. Too young for the Army.

1159
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:20,807
Plenty of boys younger
than Robert signing up.

1160
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:25,478
Don't take Robbie.

1161
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:27,939
Don't let me lose my son.

1162
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,860
Go away! We're occupied!

1163
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:36,948
Secretary Stanton has sent over

1164
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:38,491
to tell you that as of half an hour ago

1165
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,994
the shelling of Wilmington Harbor
has commenced.

1166
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,877
They cannot possibly maintain
under this kind of an assault.

1167
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:51,463
Terry has got 10,000 men
surrounding the goddamn port.

1168
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:52,547
Why doesn't he answer...

1169
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:54,591
Fort Fisher is a mountain
of a building, Edwin.

1170
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:55,759
It's the largest fort they have, sir.

1171
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,719
Twenty-two big Seacoast guns
on each rampart.

1172
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,095
They've been reinforcing it
for the last two years.

1173
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,264
They've taken 17,000 shells
since yesterday!

1174
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,975
I want to hear Fort Fisher is ours

1175
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,268
and Wilmington has fallen.

1176
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:06,853
Send another damn cable!

1177
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:09,564
The problem's their
commander, Whiting!

1178
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,775
He engineered the fortress himself,

1179
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:12,901
the damn thing's his child.

1180
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,361
He'll defend it till
his every last man is gone.

1181
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:17,906
"Come on out, you old rat!"

1182
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:23,953
That's
what Ethan Allen called out

1183
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:27,582
to the commander
of Fort Ticonderoga in 1776.

1184
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,751
"Come on out, you old rat!"

1185
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,086
Of course, there were only

1186
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,589
40 odd Redcoats at Ticonderoga.

1187
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,511
There is one Ethan Allen story
that I'm very partial to.

1188
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:42,096
No, you're going to tell a story.

1189
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:45,141
I don't believe that I can bear

1190
01:00:45,226 --> 01:00:47,185
to listen to another one
of your stories right now.

1191
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:50,772
I need the B&O sideyard
schedules for Alexandria!

1192
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,315
I asked for them this morning!

1193
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:56,986
It was
right after the Revolution,

1194
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:59,447
right after peace had been concluded.

1195
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:02,492
And Ethan Allen went to London

1196
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,244
to help our new country

1197
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,746
conduct its business with the King.

1198
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,375
The English sneered
at how rough we are

1199
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,794
and rude and simple-minded,
and on like that,

1200
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,878
everywhere he went

1201
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:16,923
till one day he was invited
to the townhouse

1202
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,967
of a great English lord.

1203
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:24,264
Dinner was served
and beverages imbibed,

1204
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:27,392
time passed, as happens, and

1205
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:30,103
Mr. Allen found he needed the privy.

1206
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:34,274
He was grateful to be directed thence.

1207
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,029
Relieved, you might say.

1208
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:44,784
Now, Mr. Allen discovered

1209
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,911
on entering the water closet,

1210
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:49,581
that the only decoration therein

1211
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:52,292
was a portrait of George Washington.

1212
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:58,172
Ethan Allen done what he came to do,

1213
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,633
and returned to the drawing room.

1214
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:03,428
His host and the others
were disappointed

1215
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,555
when he didn't mention
Washington's portrait.

1216
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,266
Finally, His Lordship couldn't
resist and asked Mr. Allen

1217
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,059
had he noticed it,
the picture of Washington.

1218
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,603
He had.

1219
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:13,271
Well, what did he think of its placement,

1220
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:16,399
did it seem appropriately
located to Mr. Allen?

1221
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,568
Mr. Allen said it did.

1222
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,361
His host was astounded.

1223
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,488
"Appropriate?"

1224
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:25,491
"George Washington's likeness
in a water closet?"

1225
01:02:25,618 --> 01:02:28,995
"Yes," said Mr. Allen.
"Where it'll do good service.

1226
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:31,789
"The whole world knows nothing
will make an Englishman

1227
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:34,125
"shit quicker than the sight
of George Washington."

1228
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:40,506
I love that story.

1229
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:09,535
Fort Fisher is ours. We've taken the port.

1230
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:11,204
And Wilmington?

1231
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,374
We've taken the fort,

1232
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,793
but the city of Wilmington
has not surrendered.

1233
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,379
How many casualties?

1234
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,643
- Heavy losses.
- And more to come.

1235
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,312
It sours the national mood.
It might suffice...

1236
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:38,314
To what? To bring this down?

1237
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:40,900
Not in a fight like this.
This is to the death.

1238
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:42,568
That's gruesome.

1239
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,321
Are you despairing or merely lazy?

1240
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:48,574
This fight is for
the United States of America.

1241
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:51,577
Nothing "suffices." A rumor? Nothing.

1242
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:54,580
They're not lazy.
They're busily buying votes

1243
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,917
while we hope to be saved
by "the national mood"?

1244
01:04:03,924 --> 01:04:07,510
Before this blood is dry, when
Stevens next takes the floor,

1245
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,345
taunt him. You excel at that.

1246
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,514
Get him to proclaim what
we all know he believes

1247
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,266
in his coal-colored heart.

1248
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,019
That this vote is meant
to set the black race on high,

1249
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:17,103
to niggerate America...

1250
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:19,605
George, please, stay on course.

1251
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,608
Bring Stevens to full froth.

1252
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:25,194
I can ensure that every newspaperman

1253
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:26,612
from Louisville to San Francisco

1254
01:04:26,739 --> 01:04:28,614
will be here to witness it and print it.

1255
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,870
The floor belongs to
the mellifluent gentleman

1256
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:36,456
from Kentucky, Mr. George Yeaman.

1257
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:44,422
I thank you, Speaker Colfax.

1258
01:04:52,181 --> 01:04:55,933
Although I am disgusted by slavery,

1259
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:02,690
I rise on this sad and solemn day

1260
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:06,486
to announce that
I'm opposed to the amendment.

1261
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,786
We must consider what
will become of colored folk

1262
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:18,790
if four million are, in one instant,
set free.

1263
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,374
They'll be free, George,

1264
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:22,335
that's what will become of them.

1265
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,629
Think how splendid

1266
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,507
if Mr. Yeaman switched.

1267
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:30,426
Too publicly against us.
He can't change course now.

1268
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:33,638
Not for some miserable
little job, anyways.

1269
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:36,891
And we will be forced to enfranchise

1270
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:39,268
the men of the colored race.

1271
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:41,479
It would be inhuman not to.

1272
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:45,817
Now who among us is prepared
to give Negroes the vote?

1273
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:48,528
And, and,

1274
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:50,863
what shall follow upon that?

1275
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:53,699
Universal enfranchisement?

1276
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:56,077
Votes for women?

1277
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:05,002
We...

1278
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:08,589
Bless my eyes.

1279
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:11,300
If it isn't the Postmaster
of Millersburg, Ohio.

1280
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:16,389
Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound
to inform us

1281
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,392
of your disgusting betrayal.

1282
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:22,228
Your prostitution.

1283
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,731
Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins?

1284
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:29,360
Is your maidenly virtue for sale?

1285
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:33,156
If my neighbors hear

1286
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,448
that I voted yes for nigger freedom

1287
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:35,950
and no to peace, they will kill me.

1288
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:37,118
A deal is a deal.

1289
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:38,786
You men know better
than to piss your pants

1290
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,329
just 'cause there's talk
about peace talks.

1291
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,331
- Look, I'll find another job!
- My neighbors in Nashville,

1292
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:43,958
they found out I was loyal to the Union,

1293
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:45,459
they came after me with gelding knives.

1294
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:47,086
- I'll find another job.
- You do right, Clay Hawkins.

1295
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:50,506
I want to do right! But I got no courage!

1296
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:52,258
Wait. You wanted...
What was it?

1297
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:54,177
A tax man for the Western Reserve?

1298
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:56,095
Hell, you can have the whole
state of Ohio if you want...

1299
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,722
Oh, crap.

1300
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:01,809
Eleven votes?

1301
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:04,103
Two days ago, we had twelve.
What happened?

1302
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,188
There are defections in the ranks.

1303
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:06,272
It's the goddamn rumors

1304
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:07,356
regarding the Richmond delegation.

1305
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:08,441
- Yes. The peace offer.
- Groundless.

1306
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:11,152
- And yet the rumors persist.
- They are ruining us.

1307
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,321
Among the few
remaining Representatives

1308
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:14,989
who seem remotely plausible,

1309
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,575
there is a perceptible
increase in resistance.

1310
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:19,285
Resistance, hell.

1311
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,288
Thingamabob Hollister,
Dem from Indiana.

1312
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:25,124
I approached him,
sumbitch near to murdered me.

1313
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,127
Colorado Territory... What's this one?

1314
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:31,797
Job description... Taxpayers and...

1315
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:33,674
Oh, shit! Cracky!

1316
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,603
Fuck you, you son of a bitch! Goddamn!

1317
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:54,320
- Perhaps you pushed too hard.
- I push nobody.

1318
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,031
Perhaps we need reinforcements.

1319
01:07:57,491 --> 01:07:59,700
If Jeff Davis wants to cease hostilities,

1320
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:02,245
who do you think is going to
give a genuine solid shit

1321
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,412
to free slaves?

1322
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,789
Get back to it.

1323
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:07,375
And gentlemen, good day.

1324
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,127
We are at an impasse.

1325
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:12,546
Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors, publicly.

1326
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:13,673
Tell us what you expect of us.

1327
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,883
I expect you to do your work.

1328
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,510
And have sufficient sense and taste

1329
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:20,096
not to presume to instruct the President.

1330
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,180
Or me.

1331
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:24,850
Is there a Confederate offer, or not?

1332
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,535
Gentlemen.

1333
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,248
I suggest you work some changes
to your proposal

1334
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:49,375
before you give it to the President.

1335
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:51,544
We're eager to be on our way
to Washington.

1336
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,838
Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this?

1337
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:57,883
It says "securing peace
for our two countries"

1338
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,552
and it goes on like that.

1339
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:02,596
- I don't...
- There is just one country.

1340
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:05,057
You and I, we're citizens of that country.

1341
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:08,394
I'm fighting to protect it
from armed rebels.

1342
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:10,187
From you.

1343
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:12,189
But Mr. Blair, he told us,

1344
01:09:12,274 --> 01:09:14,650
he told President
Jefferson Davis that we...

1345
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:17,278
A private citizen like Preston Blair

1346
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:18,446
can say what he pleases,

1347
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:21,365
since he has no authority over anything.

1348
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,036
If you want to discuss peace
with President Lincoln,

1349
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,913
consider revisions.

1350
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:29,957
If we're not to discuss

1351
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,501
a truce between warring nations,

1352
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,545
what in heaven's name can we discuss?

1353
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,256
Terms of surrender.

1354
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,844
"Office United States
Military Telegraph,

1355
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:42,928
"War Department.

01:09:43,055 --> 01:09:45,431

"Commanding Armies, United States."

1370
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,513
After four years of war, and

1371
01:10:26,765 --> 01:10:29,308
near 600,000 lives lost,

1372
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,186
he believes we can end this war now.

1373
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:38,692
My trust in him is marrow deep.

1374
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:47,827
You could bring the delegates
to Washington.

1375
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,329
In exchange for the South's
immediate surrender,

1376
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,374
we could promise them
the amendment's defeat.

1377
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:59,380
They'd agree, don't you think?
We'd end the war. This week.

1378
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,259
Or, if you could manage

1379
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:06,470
without seeming to do it, to, uh...

1380
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:12,685
The peace delegation
might encounter delays

1381
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:14,728
as they travel up the James River.

1382
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:17,189
Particularly with the fighting
around Wilmington.

1383
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:25,489
Within ten days' time,

1384
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:28,200
we might pass the 13th Amendment.

1385
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:13,078
Here's a 16-year-old boy,

1386
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:14,747
they're going to hang him.

1387
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:17,583
He's with the Fifteenth
Indiana Cavalry near Bulford.

1388
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:20,628
It seems he lamed his horse
to avoid battle.

1389
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:24,006
I don't think even Stanton
would complain

1390
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,090
if I pardoned him.

1391
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,425
You think Stanton would complain?

1392
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:29,637
I don't know, sir.
I don't know who you're, uh...

1393
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:32,139
- What time is it?
- It's 3:40 in the morning.

1394
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:35,726
Don't let him pardon any more deserters.

1395
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,521
Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too many.

1396
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:40,147
He's generally apoplectic on the subject.

1397
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,815
He oughtn't have done that,
crippled his horse.

1398
01:12:41,942 --> 01:12:43,192
That was cruel, but you don't just hang

1399
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,276
a 16-year-old boy for that...

1400
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:45,528
Ask the horse what he thinks.

1401
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:49,240
...for cruelty. There'd be
no 16-year-old boys left.

1402
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:10,135
Grant wants me to bring
the secesh delegates

1403
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,762
to Washington.

1404
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,433
So there are secesh delegates?

1405
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,395
He was afraid, that's all it was.

1406
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:22,439
I don't care to hang a boy
for being frightened, either.

1407
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,109
What good would it do him?

1408
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,167
War's nearly done, ain't that so?

1409
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:47,673
What use is one more corpse?

1410
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,510
Any more corpses?

1411
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,521
Do you need company?

1412
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,524
In times like this,
I'm best alone.

1413
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:48,567
"Lieutenant General
Ulysses S. Grant, City Point.

1414

01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:55,741

"A. Lincoln." And the date.

1424
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:23,102
Yes, sir.

1425
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:28,982
Shall I transmit, sir?

1426
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:34,905
You think we choose to be born?

1427
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:42,413
I don't suppose so.

1428
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:46,583
Are we fitted to the times
we're born into?

1429
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,129
Well, I don't know about myself.

1430
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:52,631
You may be,

1431
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,008
sir. Fitted.

1432
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:00,806
What do you reckon?

1433
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,810
Well, I'm an engineer.

1434
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:09,356
I reckon there's machinery,

1435
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:12,359
but no one's done the fitting.

1436
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:17,531
You're an engineer.

1437
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:21,452
You must know Euclid's axioms
and common notions.

1438
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:25,497
I must have in school, but...

1439
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:26,790
I never had much of schooling,

1440
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:29,793
but I read Euclid
in an old book I borrowed.

1441
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:33,213
Little enough ever found its way in here,

1442
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,674
but once learnt, it stayed learnt.

1443
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:41,305
Euclid's first common notion is this,

1444
01:16:41,973 --> 01:16:44,266
"Things which are equal
to the same thing

1445
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:47,227
"are equal to each other."

1446
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:51,231
That's a rule of mathematical reasoning.

1447
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:53,609
It's true because it works.

1448
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:55,861
Has done and always will do.

1449
01:16:58,156 --> 01:17:00,657
In his book, mmm,

1450
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:04,203
Euclid says this is "self-evident."

1451
01:17:05,163 --> 01:17:06,121
You see? There it is,

1452
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:08,874
even in that 2,000-year-old book

1453
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,542
of mechanical law.

1454
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:12,586
It is a self-evident truth

1455
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:15,756
that things which are equal
to the same thing

1456
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:18,091
are equal to each other.

1457
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,055
We begin with equality.

1458
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:26,058
That's the origin, isn't it?

1459
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:29,061
That's balance. That's... That's fairness.

1460
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,692
That's justice.

1461
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:44,451
Just read me back the last sentence

1462
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,787
of the telegram, please.

1463
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:49,540
"Have Captain Saunders convey
the commissioners to me

1464
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:50,624
"here in Washington."

1465
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:53,961
A slight emendation,
if you would, Sam.

1466
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:59,216
"Have Captain Saunders
convey the gentlemen

1467
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,551
"aboard the River Queen

1468
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:05,097
"as far as Hampton Roads, Virginia,

1469
01:18:05,473 --> 01:18:07,558

01:18:10,228 --> 01:18:12,646
"further advice from me.

1471
01:18:15,108 --> 01:18:17,317
"Do not proceed to Washington."

1472
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:05,282
The World, the Herald,
the Times,

1473
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,326
New York, Chicago,

1474
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,536
the Journal of Commerce,

1475
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,204
even your hometown paper's here.

1476
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:14,791
Say you believe only in
legal equality for all races,

1477
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:16,251
not racial equality.

1478
01:19:16,336 --> 01:19:18,003
I beg you, sir.

1479
01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:21,506
Compromise. Or you risk it all.

1480
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:45,238
I've asked you a question, Mr. Stevens,

1481
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:47,240
and you must answer me.

1482
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:50,327
Do you or do you not
hold that the precept

1483
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:53,872
that "All men are created equal"
is meant literally?

1484
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:02,297
Is that not the true purpose
of the amendment?

1485
01:20:02,382 --> 01:20:05,258
To promote your ultimate
and ardent dream to elevate...

1486
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:07,761
The true purpose
of the amendment, Mr. Wood,

1487
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,638
you perfectly named,

1488
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,890
brainless obstructive object...

1489
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,561
Now you have always insisted,
Mr. Stevens,

1490
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:20,941
that Negroes are the same
as white men are.

1491
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,403
The true purpose of the amendment...

1492
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:54,224
I don't hold with equality in all things,

1493
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,435
only with equality before the law.
Nothing more.

1494
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:00,814
That's... That's not so.

1495
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:04,860
You believe that Negroes are
entirely equal to white men.

1496
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,153
You've said it a thousand times!

1497
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:08,572
For shame! For shame!

1498
01:21:08,656 --> 01:21:11,491
Stop prevaricating and
answer Representative Wood!

1499
01:21:11,743 --> 01:21:13,785
I don't hold with equality in all things,

1500
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:14,911
only with equality before the law.

1501
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:17,914
After the decades of fervent advocacy...

1502
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,958
He's answered your questions!

1503
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,793
This amendment's
not to do with race equality.

1504
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:25,047
I don't hold with equality in all things,

1505
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:28,759
only with equality before
the law, and nothing more!

1506
01:21:28,843 --> 01:21:31,053
Who'd ever have guessed
that old nightmare

1507
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:32,971
capable of such control?

1508
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:34,890
He might make a politician someday.

1509
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:36,224
I need to go.

1510
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:37,809
Mrs. Keckley.

1511
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:43,315
Your frantic attempt to delude us now

1512
01:21:43,441 --> 01:21:44,983
is unworthy of a representative.

1513
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,152
It is, in fact, unworthy of a white man!

1514
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:53,909
How can I hold that
all men are created equal

1515
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:57,079
when here before me stands, stinking,

1516
01:21:57,163 --> 01:22:00,749
the moral carcass of
the gentleman from Ohio, proof

1517
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,335
that some men are inferior,

1518
01:22:03,461 --> 01:22:05,962
endowed by their Maker with dim wits,

1519
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:08,006
impermeable to reason,

1520
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:11,176
with cold, pallid slime in their veins

1521
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:13,637
instead of hot, red blood!

1522
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:17,474
You are more reptile than man, George!

1523
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:19,893
So low and flat that the foot of man

1524
01:22:20,019 --> 01:22:21,353
is incapable of crushing you.

1525
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,230
How dare you?

1526
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:26,441
Yet even you, Pendleton,

1527
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,444
who should have been
gibbeted for treason

1528
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:30,570
long before today.

1529
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,156
Even worthless, unworthy you

1530
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:36,243
ought to be treated equally
before the law!

1531
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:41,748
And so again, sir, again
and again and again I say,

1532
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,960
I do not hold with equality in all things,

1533
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:47,295
only with equality before the law.

1534
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:54,302
Mr. Speaker, will you permit
this vile, boorish man

1535
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:56,888
to slander and to threaten me?

1536
01:22:57,098 --> 01:22:58,557
And to reduce these proceedings

1537
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:01,935
on this most important matter
into an anarchic

1538
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:04,855
and tawdry burlesque?

1539
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:32,549
You asked if ever I was surprised.

1540
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,719
Today, Mr. Stevens,

1541
01:23:35,887 --> 01:23:36,887
I was surprised.

1542
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:41,391
You've led the battle for
race equality for 30 years.

1543
01:23:46,731 --> 01:23:49,900
The basis of every hope for
this country's future life,

1544
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:53,028
you denied Negro equality.
I'm nauseated.

1545
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:55,697
You refused to say that all humans are...

1546
01:23:55,781 --> 01:23:57,574
Well, human.

1547
01:23:58,284 --> 01:24:00,702
Have you lost your very soul,
Mr. Stevens?

1548
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:02,287
Is there nothing you won't say?

1549
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,039
I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa.

1550
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:05,790
That must be unpleasant.

1551
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,293
I want the amendment to pass,

1552
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,295
so that the Constitution's first

1553
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:11,796
and only mention of slavery

1554
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:14,049
is its absolute prohibition.

1555
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:16,468
For this amendment, for which
I have worked all my life

1556
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:19,221
and for which countless
colored men and women

1557
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:20,388
have fought and died

1558
01:24:20,473 --> 01:24:23,475
and now hundreds
of thousands of soldiers...

1559
01:24:23,601 --> 01:24:25,143
No, sir, no.

1560
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:29,314
It seems there's very nearly
nothing I won't say.

1561
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:01,930
I'm not going in.

1562
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:09,312
You said you wanted to help me.

1563
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:13,525
But this is just a clumsy attempt
to discourage me.

1564
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:16,027
I've been to Army hospitals.
I've seen surgeries.

1565
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:19,030
I went and visited
the malaria barges with Mama.

1566
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:21,032
She told me she didn't take you inside.

1567
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,534
I snuck in afterwards.

1568
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,953
I've seen what it's like.
This changes nothing.

1569
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,165
Well, at all rate, son,

1570
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,084
I'm happy to have your company.

1571
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,427
- Good morning, Jim.
- Hello, Mr. President.

1572
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:42,345
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

1573
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:47,100
Well, boys, first question.
You getting enough to eat?

1574
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:48,435
Hello, sir.

1575
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:49,894
- What's your name, soldier?
- Robert.

1576
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:52,480
- Good to meet you, Robert.
- Nice to meet you.

1577
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:53,565
- What's your name?
- Kevin.

1578
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:54,691
Tell me your names as I go past.

1579
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,151
I'd like to know who I'm talking to. Kevin.

1580
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:59,112
- Mr. President. John.
- John. I've seen you before.

1581
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:00,280
Mr. President.

1582
01:26:01,032 --> 01:26:02,240
Make sure
you get some steak.

1583
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:03,825
I wouldn't mind one myself, right now.

1584
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:20,735
What's the matter, Bob?

1585
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:29,035
I have to do this, and I will do it.

1586
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,495
And I don't need
your permission to enlist.

1587
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:34,499
That same speech has been made
by how many sons

1588
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:37,127
to how many fathers
since the war began?

1589
01:27:37,211 --> 01:27:38,420
"I don't need your damn permission,

1590
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:41,047
"you miserable old goat,
I'm gonna enlist anyhow."

1591
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,173
And what wouldn't those

1592
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:43,591
numberless fathers have given

1593
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:45,510
to be able to say to their sons

1594
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:48,847
as I now say to mine,
"I'm Commander in Chief."

1595
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:51,224
So, in point of fact,
without my permission

1596
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:54,394
you ain't enlisting
in nothing nowhere, young man.

1597
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,980
It's Mama you're scared of,
it's not me getting killed.

1598
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,490
I have to do this! And I will!

1599
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:11,035
Or I will feel ashamed of myself
for the rest of my life!

1600
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:13,121
Whether or not you fought
is what's gonna matter,

1601
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,915
and not just to other people,
but to myself!

1602
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,542
I won't be you, Pa, I can't do that,

1603
01:28:17,668 --> 01:28:19,878
but I don't want to be nothing!

1604
01:28:23,257 --> 01:28:24,883
I can't lose you.

1605
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,974
He'll be fine, Molly.

1606
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:35,393
City Point's a way back
from the front lines

1607
01:28:35,478 --> 01:28:36,478
and the fighting.

1608
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:40,398
He'll be an adjutant, running
messages for General Grant.

1609
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:43,651
The war will take our son.

1610
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:46,321
A sniper, or a shrapnel shell, a typhus

1611
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:47,405
same as took Willie.

1612
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:50,909
It takes hundreds of boys a day.
He'll die uselessly.

1613
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:53,411
And how will I ever forgive you?

1614
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,915
Most men,
their firstborn is their favorite.

1615
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:59,667
You've always blamed Robert
for being born.

1616
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:01,085
For trapping you in a marriage

1617
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,754
that's only ever given you grief

1618
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,006
- and caused you regret.
- That's simply not true.

1619
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,758
And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor's

1620
01:29:06,884 --> 01:29:09,177
on your hands same as Grant,
God help us.

1621
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,763
We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood

1622
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,098
you've sanctioned,
the uncountable corpses!

1623
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:16,935
We'll be made to pay
with our son's dear blood!

1624
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:18,603
Just this once, Mrs. Lincoln,

1625
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,439
I demand of you to try
and take the liberal

1626
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:23,441
and not the selfish point of view.

1627
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:24,776
Robert will never forgive himself.

1628
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:26,444
You imagine he'll forgive us

1629
01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:30,114
if we continue to stifle
this very natural ambition?

1630
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,409
And if I refuse to take the high road?

1631
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:39,582
If I won't pick up the rough old cross,

1632
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:42,794
will you threaten me again
with the madhouse?

1633
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:46,381
As you did when I couldn't
stop crying over Willie.

1634
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:48,883
When I showed you what heartbreak,

1635
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:51,636
real heartbreak,
looked like.

1636
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,221
And you hadn't the courage

1637
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:55,390
- to countenance, to help me!
- That's right, that's right...

1638
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:57,725
When you refused so much
as to comfort Tad,

1639
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,978
a child who was not only sick,
dangerously sick,

1640
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:01,062
but beside himself with grief!

1641
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,314
I was holding him in my arms
when he died.

1642
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,900
But your grief, your grief,
your inexhaustible grief!

1643
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,860
How dare you throw that up at me?

1644
01:30:07,945 --> 01:30:09,153
And his mother wouldn't let him near her

1645
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:10,488
because she's screaming
from morning to night!

1646
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:12,615
I couldn't risk him
seeing how angry I was!

1647
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,158
Pacing the halls, howling at shadows

1648
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:15,827
and furniture and ghosts!

1649
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:18,997
I ought to have done it for Tad's sake,

1650
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,832
for everybody's goddamn sake,

1651
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:22,584
I should have clapped you
in the madhouse!

1652
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:24,127
Then do it!

1653
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:27,005
Do it! Don't you threaten me!

1654
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:29,507
You do it this time. Lock me away.

1655
01:30:29,592 --> 01:30:31,634
You'll have to, I swear,

1656
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:34,095
if Robert is killed.

1657
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:55,199
I couldn't tolerate you
grieving so for Willie

1658
01:30:55,326 --> 01:30:57,952
because I couldn't permit it in myself.

1659
01:30:58,537 --> 01:31:00,538
Though I wanted to, Mary.

1660
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,374
I wanted to crawl under the earth,

1661
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,710
into the vault, with his coffin.

1662
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:10,715
And I still do. Every day I do.

1663
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,801
Don't speak to me about grief.

1664
01:31:23,062 --> 01:31:26,814
I must make my decisions,
Bob must make his, you yours.

1665
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:30,318
And bear what we must.
Hold and carry what we must.

1666
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:34,072
What I carry within me,
you must allow me to do it.

1667
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:37,075
Alone, as I must. And you alone, Mary,

1668
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:40,745
you alone may lighten this burden.

1669
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:43,915
Or render it intolerable.

1670
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:45,917
As you choose.

1671
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,691
You think I'm ignorant
of what you're up to

1672
01:32:09,775 --> 01:32:10,858
because you haven't discussed

1673
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:13,277
this scheme with me
as you ought to have done?

1674
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:16,197
When have I ever been
so easily bamboozled?

1675
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:17,865
I believe you when you insist

1676
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,450
that amending the Constitution

1677
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:21,536
and abolishing slavery will end this war.

1678
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,955
And since you are
sending my son into the war,

1679
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:27,125
woe unto you if you fail
to pass the amendment.

1680
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:33,297
Seward doesn't want me
leaving big muddy footprints

1681
01:32:33,424 --> 01:32:34,924
all over town.

1682
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:40,722
No one has ever lived
who knows better than you

1683
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:42,890
the proper placement of footfalls

1684
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:44,892
on treacherous paths.

1685
01:32:44,977 --> 01:32:47,729
Seward can't do it. You must.

1686
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:52,150
Because if you fail to acquire
the necessary votes,

1687
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:55,111
woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me.

1688
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,793
Thank you.

1689
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:19,802
I know the vote is only four days away.

1690
01:33:20,429 --> 01:33:22,096
I know you're concerned.

1691
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:24,265
Thank you for your concern over this.

1692
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:27,977
And I want you to know,
they'll approve it.

1693
01:33:29,313 --> 01:33:31,022
God will see to it.

1694
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:34,859
I don't envy Him his task.

1695
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:39,030
He may wish He'd chosen
an instrument for His purpose

1696
01:33:39,156 --> 01:33:42,158
more wieldy than
the House of Representatives.

1697
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,203
Then you'll see to it.

1698
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:50,792
Are you afraid of what
lies ahead for your people

1699
01:33:50,876 --> 01:33:52,376
if we succeed?

1700
01:33:53,879 --> 01:33:56,172
White people don't want us here.

1701
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:58,966
- Many don't.
- What about you?

1702
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:06,682
I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.

1703
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:09,060
Any of you.

1704
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:13,523
You're familiar to me, as all people are,

1705
01:34:14,817 --> 01:34:17,819
unaccommodated, poor, bare,
forked creatures,

1706
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:19,570
such as we all are.

1707
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:23,574
You have a right to expect what I expect.

1708
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:26,077
And likely our expectations

1709
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:28,663
are not incomprehensible to each other.

1710
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:34,502
I assume I'll get used to you.

1711
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:37,588
Now what you are to the nation,

1712
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:41,259
what'll become of you
once slavery's day is done,

1713
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:43,386
I don't know.

1714
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:47,598
What my people are to be, I can't say.

1715
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:52,854
Negroes have been fighting
and dying for freedom

1716
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:55,940
since the first of us was a slave.

1717
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:59,527
I never heard any ask
what freedom would bring.

1718
01:35:01,655 --> 01:35:03,281
Freedom is first.

1719
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,535
As for me,

1720
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:11,622
my son died fighting for the Union,

1721
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,876
wearing the Union blue.

1722
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:17,211
For freedom he died.

1723
01:35:19,298 --> 01:35:21,007
And I'm his mother.

1724
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:26,137
That's what I am
to the nation, Mr. Lincoln.

1725
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:32,226
What else must I be?

1726
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,571
My whole hand's gonna be proud
in about five seconds.

1727
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,239
Let's see how proud you can be.

1728
01:35:46,408 --> 01:35:48,993
Go away. That watch fob, is that gold?

1729
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:50,661
You keep your eyes off my fob.

1730
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:52,955
Gentlemen, you have a visitor.

1731
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,166
- Goddamn!
- Hey, Bill.

1732
01:35:57,336 --> 01:35:58,961
Well, I'll be fucked.

1733
01:35:59,046 --> 01:36:00,504
I wouldn't bet against it.

1734
01:36:00,589 --> 01:36:01,756
Mr... uh?

1735
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:03,925
W. N. Bilbo.

1736
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:06,093
Yeah, Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.

1737
01:36:06,178 --> 01:36:07,178
Sir.

1738
01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:09,055
Why are you here? No offense,

1739
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:12,475
but Mr. Seward's banished
the very mention of your name.

1740
01:36:12,559 --> 01:36:14,226
He won't even let us use fifty cent pieces

1741
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:16,187
'cause they've got your face on 'em.

1742
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:19,523
The Secretary of State here
tells me that you got

1743
01:36:19,608 --> 01:36:22,068
11 Democrats in the bag.
That's encouraging.

1744
01:36:22,194 --> 01:36:25,905
Oh, you've got no cause
to be encouraged, sir.

1745
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:29,241
Are we being fired?

1746
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:34,538
"We have heard the chimes
at midnight, Master Shallow."

1747
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:36,999
I'm here to alert you boys

1748
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:40,211
that the great day of reckoning
is nigh upon us.

1749
01:36:40,629 --> 01:36:42,546
The Democrats we've yet to bag, sir,

1750
01:36:42,631 --> 01:36:45,383
the patronage jobs simply won't bag 'em.

1751
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:48,094
They require more convincing,
Mr. President.

1752
01:36:49,721 --> 01:36:52,598
Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, will you?

1753
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:53,766
Sure.

1754
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:55,893
It snagged my eye
in the paper this morning

1755
01:36:55,978 --> 01:36:57,395
that the Governor Curtin

1756
01:36:57,479 --> 01:36:59,814
is set to declare a winner in the disputed

1757
01:36:59,898 --> 01:37:00,898
Congressional election for the...

1758
01:37:00,983 --> 01:37:02,149
Pennsylvania 16th District.

1759
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:05,319
District.
What a joy to be comprehended.

1760
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,989
Hop on a train to Philadel,
call on the Governor...

1761
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:09,448
Send Latham. Or Schell.

1762
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:11,534
No, he'll do fine.
Just polish yourself up first.

1763
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:15,579
The incumbent is claiming
he won it. Name of...

1764
01:37:15,664 --> 01:37:16,706
Coffroth.

1765
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:17,957
- That's him.
- Coffroth.

1766
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,959
- He's a Democrat.
- I understand that.

1767
01:37:20,627 --> 01:37:22,753
- Silly name.
- A little bit silly.

1768
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:26,215
Uh, tell Governor Curtin
it'd be much appreciated

1769
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:28,926
if he'd invite
the House of Representatives

1770
01:37:29,011 --> 01:37:30,052
to decide who won.

1771
01:37:30,137 --> 01:37:32,763
He's entitled to do that.
He'll agree to it.

1772
01:37:32,848 --> 01:37:35,141
Then advise Coffroth

1773
01:37:35,267 --> 01:37:37,601
if he hopes to retain his seat,

1774
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:39,979
then he'd better pay a visit
to Thaddeus Stevens.

1775
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:41,689
Well, pity poor Coffroth.

1776
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:45,276
It opens!

1777
01:37:52,284 --> 01:37:53,659
You are Canfrey?

1778
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:58,831
Coffroth, Mr. Stevens.
Alexander Coffroth.

1779
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:01,876
Are we representatives
of the same state?

1780
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:03,919
Yes, sir.
We sit only three desks apart.

1781
01:38:04,004 --> 01:38:05,838
I haven't noticed you.

1782
01:38:06,465 --> 01:38:09,467
I'm a Republican and you,
Coughdrop, are a Democrat?

1783
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:12,928
Well, uh, I, um,
that is to say...

1784
01:38:13,013 --> 01:38:15,014
The modern travesty
of Thomas Jefferson's

1785
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,265
political organization

1786
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:18,100
to which you've attached
yourself like a barnacle

1787
01:38:18,185 --> 01:38:21,479
has the effrontery to call
itself the Democratic Party.

1788
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:24,523
You are a Democrat.
What's the matter with you?

1789
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:26,233
Are you wicked?

1790
01:38:26,318 --> 01:38:27,902
- Well, I felt...
- Never mind.

1791
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:30,237
Coffsnot, you were
ignominiously trounced

1792
01:38:30,322 --> 01:38:31,864
at the hustings in November's election

1793
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,949
by your worthy challenger,
a Republican.

1794
01:38:34,034 --> 01:38:35,910
No, sir, I was not trounced.

1795
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:37,995
He wants to steal my seat.
I didn't lose the election.

1796
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,538
What difference does it make
if you lost or not?

1797
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:43,834
The governor of our state
is... A Democrat?

1798
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:47,338
No, he's, he's a...

1799
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:50,382
Re-...

1800
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:52,676
Re-...

1801
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:56,013
- ...-pub-...-lic-...
- ...-pub-...-lic-...

1802
01:38:56,098 --> 01:38:57,640
- ...-can.
- ...-can. Republican.

1803
01:38:57,724 --> 01:38:59,934
I know what he is.
This is a rhetorical exercise.

1804
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:01,894
And Congress is controlled
by what party? Yours?

1805
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:06,190
Your party was beaten.

1806
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,818
Your challenger's party
now controls the House

1807
01:39:08,902 --> 01:39:11,612
and hence the House
Committee on Elections,

1808
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:14,156
so you have been beaten.

1809
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:17,159
You shall shortly be sent home
in disgrace. Unless...

1810
01:39:17,244 --> 01:39:18,244
I know what I must do, sir.

1811
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:20,621
I will immediately become
a Republican and vote yes...

1812
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:21,705
No!

1813
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,875
Coffroth will vote yes,

1814
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,919
but Coffroth will remain a Democrat

1815
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:28,003
until after he does so.

1816
01:39:28,088 --> 01:39:29,672
Why wait to switch? I'm happy to...

1817
01:39:29,756 --> 01:39:32,007
We want to show the amendment
has bipartisan support,

1818
01:39:32,092 --> 01:39:34,051
you idiot. Early in the next Congress,

1819
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:36,387
when I tell you to do so,
you will switch parties.

1820
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:40,015
Now congratulations
on your victory, and get out.

1821
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:42,560
Now, give me the names

1822
01:39:42,644 --> 01:39:44,603
of whoever else you've been hunting.

1823
01:39:44,938 --> 01:39:46,230
Aw, hell.

1824
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:47,648
George Yeaman.

1825
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:49,150
Yes. Yeaman.

1826
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:51,360
Among others.

1827
01:39:51,444 --> 01:39:53,070
- But Yeaman, that'd count.
- Yeah.

1828
01:39:53,155 --> 01:39:54,947
Y-E-A-M-A-N.

1829
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:56,740
I got it.

1830
01:39:57,617 --> 01:39:58,701
Kentucky.

1831
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:04,707
I can't vote for
the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.

1832
01:40:12,257 --> 01:40:14,425
I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman,

1833
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:17,428
filled with colored men in chains

1834
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:18,762
heading down the Mississippi

1835
01:40:18,889 --> 01:40:20,764
to the New Orleans slave markets.

1836
01:40:22,225 --> 01:40:23,434
It sickened me.

1837
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:27,229
And more than that,
it brought a shadow down.

1838
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:31,108
A pall around my eyes.

1839
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,446
Slavery troubled me
as long as I can remember

1840
01:40:36,281 --> 01:40:38,490
in a way it never troubled my father,

1841
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:41,785
though he hated it, in his own fashion.

1842
01:40:43,246 --> 01:40:45,164
He knew no smallholding dirt farmer

1843
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:46,957
could compete with slave plantations

1844
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,335
so he took us out from Kentucky

1845
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:50,669
to get away from 'em.

1846
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:52,588
He wanted Indiana kept free.

1847
01:40:54,132 --> 01:40:55,799
He wasn't a kind man

1848
01:40:57,427 --> 01:41:00,846
but there was a rough,
moral urge for fairness,

1849
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,306
for freedom in him.

1850
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:05,309
I learnt that from him, I suppose.

1851
01:41:06,186 --> 01:41:07,519
If little else from him.

1852
01:41:10,148 --> 01:41:12,358
We didn't care
for one another, Mr. Yeaman.

1853
01:41:15,987 --> 01:41:17,571
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

1854
01:41:17,656 --> 01:41:20,741
Loving kindness, that most
ordinary thing, came to me

1855
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,993
from other sources. I'm grateful for that.

1856
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,955
Well, I hate it, too, sir.

1857
01:41:27,332 --> 01:41:28,666
Slavery, but...

1858
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:32,628
But we're entirely unready
for emancipation.

1859
01:41:33,171 --> 01:41:34,296
And there's too many questions...

1860
01:41:34,381 --> 01:41:35,714
We're unready for peace, too, ain't we?

1861
01:41:36,967 --> 01:41:39,176
Yeah, when it comes,
it'll present us with conundrums

1862
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:42,596
and dangers greater than
any we faced during the war,

1863
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:44,431
bloody as it's been.

1864
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:48,394
We'll have to extemporize and
experiment with what it is,

1865
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,645
when it is.

1866
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,692
I read your speech, George.

1867
01:41:55,652 --> 01:41:57,319
Negroes and the vote,

1868
01:41:58,405 --> 01:41:59,530
that's a puzzle.

1869
01:42:00,407 --> 01:42:04,034
No, no. But, but, but Negroes can't

1870
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,913
uh, vote, Mr. Lincoln.

1871
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:10,833
You're not suggesting
we enfranchise colored people?

1872
01:42:11,001 --> 01:42:12,626
I'm asking only that

1873
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:16,547
you disenthrall yourself
from the slave powers.

1874
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:19,174
I'll let you know when

1875
01:42:19,259 --> 01:42:20,884
there's an offer on my desk
for surrender.

1876
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:22,177
There's none before us now.

1877
01:42:22,262 --> 01:42:23,387
What's before us now,

1878
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:26,223
that's the vote on the 13th Amendment.

1879
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,852
And it's going to be so very close.

1880
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:35,024
You see what you can do.

1881
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:45,868
I can't make sense of it.

1882
01:42:46,411 --> 01:42:48,370
What he died for.

1883
01:42:50,957 --> 01:42:53,250
Mr. Lincoln, I hate them all.

1884
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,461
I do. All black people.

1885
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:07,222
I am a prejudiced man.

1886
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:11,810
Well, I'd change that in you if I could,

1887
01:43:12,062 --> 01:43:13,437
but that's not why I come.

1888
01:43:14,272 --> 01:43:15,939
I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton,

1889
01:43:16,066 --> 01:43:19,443
but I expect colored people
most likely be free.

1890
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,570
And when that's so, it's simple truth

1891
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:23,655
that your brother's bravery

1892
01:43:23,782 --> 01:43:25,616
and his death helped make it so.

1893
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:28,494
Only you can decide whether

1894
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,953
that's sense enough for you or not.

1895
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:35,584
My deepest sympathies to your family.

1896
01:43:48,306 --> 01:43:50,849
We've managed our members
to a fare-thee-well.

1897
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:53,310
You've had no defections

1898
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:55,354
from the Republican right to trouble you.

1899
01:43:56,648 --> 01:43:58,357
Whereas as to what you promised,

1900
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:01,443
where the hell are the commissioners?

1901
01:44:02,362 --> 01:44:04,822
Oh, my God. It's true.

1902
01:44:06,491 --> 01:44:08,784
You... You lied to me.

1903
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:12,579
Mr. Lincoln, you evaded
my request for a denial

1904
01:44:12,664 --> 01:44:14,665
that there is a Confederate peace offer,

1905
01:44:14,791 --> 01:44:16,625
because there is one!

1906
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,963
We are absolutely guaranteed
to lose the whole thing.

1907
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:23,966
We don't need a goddamn
abolition amendment!

1908
01:44:24,551 --> 01:44:26,343
Leave the Constitution alone!

1909
01:44:26,678 --> 01:44:27,803
What if
the peace commissioners

1910
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:29,346
appear today, or worse...

1911
01:44:32,809 --> 01:44:35,018
I can't listen to this anymore.

1912
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:40,149
I can't accomplish a goddamn thing

1913
01:44:40,233 --> 01:44:42,734
of any human meaning or worth

1914
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:46,613
until we cure ourselves of slavery

1915
01:44:46,698 --> 01:44:49,408
and end this pestilential war!

1916
01:44:50,702 --> 01:44:53,328
And whether any of you
or anyone else knows it,

1917
01:44:53,413 --> 01:44:55,372
I know I need this!

1918
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:58,834
This amendment is that cure!

1919
01:45:02,172 --> 01:45:04,882
We are stepped out upon
the world stage now!

1920
01:45:05,008 --> 01:45:06,216
Now!

1921
01:45:06,885 --> 01:45:09,845
With the fate of human dignity
in our hands!

1922
01:45:11,681 --> 01:45:14,224
Blood's been spilt to
afford us this moment!

1923
01:45:14,434 --> 01:45:16,727
Now! Now! Now!

1924
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:20,606
And you grousle and heckle
and dodge about like

1925
01:45:20,732 --> 01:45:22,691
pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters!

1926
01:45:23,902 --> 01:45:25,569
See what is before you.

1927
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:29,281
See the here and now, that's the

1928
01:45:29,407 --> 01:45:32,451
hardest thing,
the only thing that accounts.

1929
01:45:34,412 --> 01:45:38,499
Abolishing slavery
by constitutional provision

1930
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:42,377
settles the fate for all coming time

1931
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:46,632
not only of the millions now in bondage

1932
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,720
but of unborn millions to come.

1933
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:57,476
Two votes stand in its way.
These votes must be procured.

1934
01:46:01,898 --> 01:46:06,485
We need two yeses,
three abstentions, or

1935
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:07,736
four yeses

1936
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:11,532
and one more abstention,
and the amendment will pass.

1937
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:13,116
You got a night, and a day, and a night,

1938
01:46:13,243 --> 01:46:14,576
and several perfectly good hours.

1939
01:46:14,661 --> 01:46:16,662
Now get the hell out of here and get 'em.

1940
01:46:17,497 --> 01:46:18,997
Yes. But how?

1941
01:46:21,251 --> 01:46:22,584
Buzzards' guts, man.

1942
01:46:25,129 --> 01:46:29,299
I am the President of the
United States of America

1943
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:32,469
clothed in immense power.

1944
01:46:34,973 --> 01:46:37,307
You will procure me these votes.

1945
01:47:46,586 --> 01:47:49,379
We welcome you, ladies and gentlemen,

1946
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:53,759
first in the history of
this people's chamber,

1947
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:56,595
to your House.

1948
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:22,913
Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.

1949
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:33,465
On the matter of the
joint resolution before us,

1950
01:48:33,591 --> 01:48:34,675
presenting a 13th Amendment

1951
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:37,010
to our National Constitution,

1952
01:48:37,095 --> 01:48:39,388
which was passed last year
by the Senate

1953
01:48:39,472 --> 01:48:40,889
and which has been debated now

1954
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:43,517
by this estimable body
for the past several weeks,

1955
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:45,811
today we will vote.

1956
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:53,193
By mutual agreement,

1957
01:48:53,277 --> 01:48:55,529
we shall hear brief, final statements,

1958
01:48:57,115 --> 01:48:58,573
beginning with

1959
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:00,909
the honorable
George Pendleton of Ohio.

1960
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:08,625
I have just received

1961
01:49:10,545 --> 01:49:11,628
confirmation

1962
01:49:12,338 --> 01:49:14,715
of what previously has
been merely rumored.

1963
01:49:14,799 --> 01:49:17,384
Affidavits from loyal citizens

1964
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:19,010
recently returned from Richmond.

1965
01:49:19,137 --> 01:49:21,680
They testify that
commissioners have indeed

1966
01:49:21,973 --> 01:49:23,265
come north and ought to have arrived

1967
01:49:23,349 --> 01:49:25,225
by now in Washington City

1968
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:28,311
bearing an offer of immediate cessation

1969
01:49:28,688 --> 01:49:29,855
of our civil war.

1970
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:33,316
Is it true, sir?

1971
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:35,902
Are there Confederate
commissioners in the capital?

1972
01:49:35,987 --> 01:49:37,779
I have no idea where they are
or if they've arrived.

1973
01:49:37,864 --> 01:49:38,989
They'll arrive.

1974
01:49:39,323 --> 01:49:41,241
I appeal to
my fellow Democrats,

1975
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:43,493
to all Republican representatives

1976
01:49:43,578 --> 01:49:44,995
who give a fig for peace,

1977
01:49:45,329 --> 01:49:47,330
postpone this vote!

1978
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:48,665
Until we have answers

1979
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:49,916
from the President himself!

1980
01:49:50,209 --> 01:49:51,209
Postpone the vote!

1981
01:49:51,669 --> 01:49:54,045
Postpone the vote!

1982
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:56,965
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1983
01:49:57,383 --> 01:50:00,302
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1984
01:50:00,386 --> 01:50:01,636
Postpone the vote!

1985
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:03,430
Postpone the vote!

1986
01:50:03,514 --> 01:50:05,140
- Postpone the vote!
- Gentlemen!

1987
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:06,641
Postpone the vote!

1988
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:09,811
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1989
01:50:10,438 --> 01:50:12,314
Postpone the vote! Postpone the vote!

1990
01:50:14,233 --> 01:50:16,109
I have made a motion!

1991
01:50:16,194 --> 01:50:18,737
Does anyone care to second my motion?

1992
01:50:30,875 --> 01:50:32,042
Gentlemen.

1993
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:34,836
The conservative faction

1994
01:50:34,921 --> 01:50:37,047
of border and western Republicans

1995
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,341
cannot approve this amendment,

1996
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:41,510
about which we harbor grave doubts,

1997
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:45,806
if a peace offer is being
held hostage to its success.

1998
01:50:46,766 --> 01:50:48,683
Joining together with
our Democratic colleagues,

1999
01:50:48,768 --> 01:50:49,893
I second the motion

2000
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:51,394
to postpone.

2001
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:53,355
He must deny peace
commissioners are in the city.

2002
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:54,731
Quick, man. Quick.

2003
01:51:44,407 --> 01:51:47,325
This is precisely
what Mr. Wood wishes me

2004
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:48,660
to respond to?

2005
01:51:49,996 --> 01:51:51,746
Word for word, this is precisely

2006
01:51:51,831 --> 01:51:53,707
the assurance that he demands of me?

2007
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,500
Yes, sir.

2008
01:52:15,271 --> 01:52:16,771
Give this to Mr. Ashley.

2009
01:52:20,276 --> 01:52:23,987
Uh, I feel I have to say,
Mr. Lincoln, that...

2010
01:52:25,114 --> 01:52:26,615
Could you please just step outside?

2011
01:52:26,991 --> 01:52:28,074
You want to have a chat now,

2012
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:29,284
with the whole of the
House of Representatives

2013
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:30,493
waiting on this?

2014
01:52:31,120 --> 01:52:33,496
Making false representation
to Congress, is...

2015
01:52:34,165 --> 01:52:35,749
- It's...
- It's impeachable,

2016
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:38,501
but I've made no such
false representation.

2017
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,170
But there are.

2018
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,213
There is a delegation from Richmond.

2019
01:52:42,965 --> 01:52:44,299
Give me the note, Johnnie.

2020
01:52:48,095 --> 01:52:49,888
Please, deliver that to Mr. Ashley.

2021
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:10,367
From the President.

2022
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:12,452
"So far as I know, there are no

2023
01:53:12,536 --> 01:53:13,954
"peace commissioners in the city

2024
01:53:14,038 --> 01:53:15,372
"nor are there likely to be."

2025
01:53:16,666 --> 01:53:18,333
"So far as I know"?

2026
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:20,794
That means nothing.

2027
01:53:22,254 --> 01:53:25,256
Are there commissioners from
the South, or aren't there?

2028
01:53:26,676 --> 01:53:28,134
The President
has answered you, sir.

2029
01:53:28,219 --> 01:53:29,511
Your peace offer is a fiction.

2030
01:53:29,804 --> 01:53:30,971
That is not a denial.

2031
01:53:31,847 --> 01:53:33,390
It is a lawyer's dodge!

2032
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,935
Mr. Haddam, is your faction satisfied?

2033
01:53:39,814 --> 01:53:42,315
The conservative Republican
faction is satisfied.

2034
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,900
And we thank Mr. Lincoln.

2035
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:47,153
I move to table Mr. Wood's motion.

2036
01:53:47,613 --> 01:53:48,655
Tabled!

2037
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,786
Mr. Colfax, I order the main question.

2038
01:53:55,538 --> 01:53:57,372
A motion has been made to bring the bill

2039
01:53:57,456 --> 01:53:59,374
for the 13th Amendment to a vote.

2040
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:00,500
Do I hear a second?

2041
01:54:00,668 --> 01:54:01,835
I second the motion.

2042
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:04,295
So moved, so ordered.

2043
01:54:05,006 --> 01:54:06,131
The Clerk will now...

2044
01:54:06,215 --> 01:54:07,382
Quiet, please!

2045
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:11,302
The Clerk will now
call the roll for the voting.

2046
01:54:17,393 --> 01:54:18,560
We begin with Connecticut.

2047
01:54:18,853 --> 01:54:20,562
Mr. Augustus Benjamin,

2048
01:54:20,646 --> 01:54:23,023
on the matter of this amendment,
how say you?

2049
01:54:23,482 --> 01:54:24,566
Nay!

2050
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:27,694
Mr. Arthur Bentleigh.

2051
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:30,030
Nay!

2052
01:54:33,451 --> 01:54:35,785
Mr. John Ellis, how say you?

2053
01:54:36,203 --> 01:54:37,245
Aye!

2054
01:54:37,329 --> 01:54:38,329
What!

2055
01:54:45,046 --> 01:54:48,006
Missouri next. Mr. Walter Appleton.

2056
01:54:48,966 --> 01:54:50,258
I vote no.

2057
01:54:51,927 --> 01:54:53,178
Mr. Josiah Burton.

2058
01:54:54,722 --> 01:54:58,516
Beanpole Burton is pleased to vote yea!

2059
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:01,978
The State of New Jersey.

2060
01:55:02,063 --> 01:55:04,230
- Mr. Nehemiah Cleary.
- No!

2061
01:55:07,068 --> 01:55:08,485
Mr. James Martinson.

2062
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:11,154
Mr. Martinson has delegated me

2063
01:55:11,572 --> 01:55:13,323
to say he is indisposed.

2064
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,533
And he abstains.

2065
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:19,162
Mr. Austin J. Roberts.

2066
01:55:19,413 --> 01:55:21,706
Also indisposed, also abstaining.

2067
01:55:27,004 --> 01:55:28,296
Illinois concluded.

2068
01:55:30,508 --> 01:55:32,717
Mr. Harold Hollister. How say you?

2069
01:55:33,427 --> 01:55:34,469
No.

2070
01:55:35,429 --> 01:55:36,721
Mr. Hutton.

2071
01:55:37,973 --> 01:55:40,141
Mr. William Hutton. Cast your vote.

2072
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:45,146
William Hutton,
remembering at this moment

2073
01:55:45,231 --> 01:55:47,107
his beloved brother Frederick

2074
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:49,526
votes against the amendment.

2075
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:02,997
Webster Allen votes no.

2076
01:56:06,293 --> 01:56:07,502
Webster Allen,

2077
01:56:07,586 --> 01:56:10,088
Illinois, Democrat,

2078
01:56:10,172 --> 01:56:12,173
votes no.

2079
01:56:13,926 --> 01:56:17,720
Halberd Law, Indiana, Democrat,

2080
01:56:17,805 --> 01:56:19,222
votes no.

2081
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:24,894
Archibald Moran, yes.

2082
01:56:27,648 --> 01:56:30,233
Ambrose Baylor, yes.

2083
01:56:32,111 --> 01:56:34,779
Mr. Walter H. Washburn.

2084
01:56:35,614 --> 01:56:36,781
Votes no.

2085
01:56:40,536 --> 01:56:43,413
And Mr. George Yeaman, how say you?

2086
01:56:55,426 --> 01:56:56,968
My vote ties us.

2087
01:57:01,098 --> 01:57:02,140
Sir, Mr. Yeaman,

2088
01:57:02,224 --> 01:57:03,933
I didn't hear your vote.

2089
01:57:04,727 --> 01:57:07,562
I said "Aye", Mr. McPherson!

2090
01:57:08,397 --> 01:57:09,439
Aye!

2091
01:57:09,565 --> 01:57:10,565
Traitor!

2092
01:57:10,691 --> 01:57:11,691
Order!

2093
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:26,789
Order in my chamber!

2094
01:57:33,547 --> 01:57:36,382
Mr. McPherson, you may proceed.

2095
01:57:39,762 --> 01:57:42,180
Mr. Clay R. Hawkins of Ohio.

2096
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:54,025
Goddamn it, I'm voting yes.

2097
01:57:55,152 --> 01:57:57,070
I don't care, you shoot me dead!

2098
01:57:57,154 --> 01:57:59,572
You shoot me dead! I am voting yes!

2099
01:58:01,075 --> 01:58:02,450
Mr. Edwin F. LeClerk.

2100
01:58:03,035 --> 01:58:04,035
No!

2101
01:58:06,872 --> 01:58:10,041
Oh, to hell with it.
Shoot me dead, too! Yes!

2102
01:58:13,379 --> 01:58:14,379
I mean...

2103
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:17,590
Abstention. Abstention!

2104
01:58:21,971 --> 01:58:23,429
Spineless! No gender.

2105
01:58:29,895 --> 01:58:31,354
Mr. Alexander Coffroth.

2106
01:58:36,610 --> 01:58:38,611
I vote

2107
01:58:39,363 --> 01:58:40,405
yes.

2108
01:58:45,327 --> 01:58:46,411
Yea.

2109
01:58:47,997 --> 01:58:49,539
James Brooks...

2110
01:58:50,541 --> 01:58:51,749
Nay.

2111
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,419
Josiah Grenelle...

2112
01:58:55,713 --> 01:58:56,921
Yea.

2113
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,215
Meyer Strauss...

2114
01:59:00,551 --> 01:59:01,634
Nay.

2115
01:59:02,303 --> 01:59:04,345
- Mr. Joseph Marstern.
- Nay.

2116
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:06,806
- Mr. Chilton A. Elliot.
- No!

2117
01:59:07,308 --> 01:59:09,309
- Mr. Daniel G. Stuart.
- I vote yes.

2118
01:59:09,685 --> 01:59:10,685
- Mr. Howard Guilfoyle.
- Yea.

2119
01:59:10,811 --> 01:59:12,186
- John F. McKenzie.
- Yea.

2120
01:59:12,354 --> 01:59:13,563
- Andrew E. Fink.
- Nay.

2121
01:59:13,647 --> 01:59:15,189
- Mr. John A. Castle.
- Yea.

2122
01:59:15,274 --> 01:59:16,649
- Mr. Hanready.
- Nay.

2123
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:18,234
- And Mr. Rufus Warren?
- Yea.

2124
01:59:39,173 --> 01:59:40,923
The roll call concludes.

2125
01:59:41,425 --> 01:59:43,593
The voting is completed. Now...

2126
01:59:43,677 --> 01:59:46,429
Mr. Clerk, please call my name.

2127
01:59:47,556 --> 01:59:48,765
I want to cast a vote.

2128
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:50,099
I object.

2129
01:59:50,976 --> 01:59:52,352
The Speaker doesn't vote.

2130
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:54,812
The Speaker may vote if he so chooses.

2131
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:57,148
It is highly unusual, sir.

2132
01:59:57,358 --> 01:59:58,983
This isn't usual, Mr. Pendleton.

2133
01:59:59,068 --> 02:00:00,276
This is history.

2134
02:00:02,738 --> 02:00:05,156
How does Mr. Schuyler Colfax vote?

2135
02:00:09,995 --> 02:00:11,454
Aye, of course.

2136
02:00:34,728 --> 02:00:35,978
The final vote.

2137
02:00:37,815 --> 02:00:39,857
Eight absent or not voting.

2138
02:00:41,777 --> 02:00:43,569
Fifty-six votes against.

2139
02:00:44,822 --> 02:00:47,073
One hundred and nineteen votes for.

2140
02:00:48,117 --> 02:00:49,826
With a margin of two votes...

2141
02:01:38,625 --> 02:01:40,501
We chose great leadership.

2142
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:56,434
We'll rally round the flag, boys

2143
02:01:56,518 --> 02:01:58,269
We'll rally once again

2144
02:01:58,353 --> 02:02:00,354
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2145
02:02:01,773 --> 02:02:04,233
We will rally from the hillside

2146
02:02:04,318 --> 02:02:06,235
We'll gather from the plain

2147
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:09,906
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2148
02:02:10,282 --> 02:02:14,535
The Union forever!
Hurrah, boys, hurrah!

2149
02:02:14,620 --> 02:02:16,454
Down with the traitor

2150
02:02:16,538 --> 02:02:18,247
And up with the star

2151
02:02:18,457 --> 02:02:22,376
Shout, shout the battle cry of Freedom!

2152
02:02:22,669 --> 02:02:24,295
Congratulations, Mr. Chairman.

2153
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:26,464
The bill, Mr. McPherson. May I?

2154
02:02:28,926 --> 02:02:32,428
The Union forever!
Hurrah, boys, hurrah!

2155
02:02:32,763 --> 02:02:35,306
That's, that's the official bill.

2156
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:37,433
I'll return it in the morning.

2157
02:02:38,018 --> 02:02:39,393
Creased,

2158
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:41,270
but unharmed.

2159
02:02:41,355 --> 02:02:45,024
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2160
02:02:45,108 --> 02:02:49,403
We are springing to the call
Of the loyal, true and brave

2161
02:02:49,571 --> 02:02:50,863
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2162
02:02:53,158 --> 02:02:55,326
And we'll fill our vacant ranks

2163
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:57,328
With a million freemen more

2164
02:02:58,205 --> 02:03:00,957
Shouting the battle cry of freedom

2165
02:03:02,125 --> 02:03:03,668
The Union forever!

2166
02:03:04,503 --> 02:03:06,003
Hurrah, boys, hurrah!

2167
02:03:06,588 --> 02:03:10,007
Down with the traitor
And up with the star

2168
02:03:31,947 --> 02:03:34,073
A gift for you.

2169
02:03:38,412 --> 02:03:40,496
The greatest measure
of the 19th century,

2170
02:03:40,581 --> 02:03:41,664
passed by corruption,

2171
02:03:41,748 --> 02:03:45,001
aided and abetted by
the purest man in America.

2172
02:04:03,645 --> 02:04:05,563
I wish you had been present.

2173
02:04:06,356 --> 02:04:08,441
- I wish I'd been.
- It was a spectacle.

2174
02:04:09,318 --> 02:04:11,777
You can't bring your
housekeeper to the House.

2175
02:04:11,862 --> 02:04:13,863
I won't give them gossip.

2176
02:04:13,947 --> 02:04:15,489
This is enough.

2177
02:04:15,866 --> 02:04:16,991
This is...

2178
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:20,453
It's more than enough for now.

2179
02:04:22,039 --> 02:04:23,748
Read it to me again, my love.

2180
02:04:25,751 --> 02:04:27,627
- "Proposed..."
- And adopted.

2181
02:04:27,711 --> 02:04:29,086
"Adopted,

2182
02:04:29,755 --> 02:04:30,880
"an amendment to

2183
02:04:30,964 --> 02:04:33,924
"the Constitution of the United States.

2184
02:04:34,009 --> 02:04:35,426
"Section One.

2185
02:04:35,844 --> 02:04:39,639
"Neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude

2186
02:04:39,723 --> 02:04:42,516
"except as a punishment for crime

2187
02:04:42,601 --> 02:04:46,062
"whereof the party shall
have been duly convicted

2188
02:04:46,605 --> 02:04:49,440
"shall exist within the United States

2189
02:04:49,941 --> 02:04:53,402
"or any place subject
to their jurisdiction."

2190
02:04:53,487 --> 02:04:54,904
Section Two.

2191
02:04:55,405 --> 02:04:59,575
"Congress shall have power
to enforce this amendment

2192
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:01,661
"by appropriate legislation."

2193
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:25,059
Let me be blunt.

2194
02:05:25,769 --> 02:05:27,436
Will the Southern states

2195
02:05:27,521 --> 02:05:30,064
resume their former position
in the Union

2196
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:31,649
speedily enough to enable us

2197
02:05:31,733 --> 02:05:34,318
to block ratification to this here

2198
02:05:34,403 --> 02:05:35,569
13th Amendment?

2199
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,742
I'd like peace immediately.

2200
02:05:42,703 --> 02:05:44,120
Yes, and?

2201
02:05:46,998 --> 02:05:49,583
I'd like your states restored to

2202
02:05:49,668 --> 02:05:53,254
their practical relations
with the Union immediately.

2203
02:05:56,007 --> 02:05:58,092
If this could be given to me in writing,

2204
02:05:58,635 --> 02:06:00,553
as Vice President of the Confederacy,

2205
02:06:00,637 --> 02:06:01,971
I'd bring that document

2206
02:06:02,055 --> 02:06:03,889
with celerity, to Jefferson Davis.

2207
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:07,685
Surrender.

2208
02:06:08,186 --> 02:06:10,521
And we can discuss reconstruction.

2209
02:06:12,357 --> 02:06:13,941
Surrender won't be thought of.

2210
02:06:14,735 --> 02:06:17,903
Unless you've assured us, in writing,

2211
02:06:17,988 --> 02:06:20,698
that we'll be readmitted
in time to block this amendment.

2212
02:06:21,283 --> 02:06:24,827
This is the arrogant demand
of a conqueror.

2213
02:06:25,036 --> 02:06:27,913
You'll not be
a conquered people, Mr. Hunter.

2214
02:06:27,998 --> 02:06:29,457
You will be citizens.

2215
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:32,209
Returned to the laws and
the guarantees of rights

2216
02:06:32,294 --> 02:06:33,294
of the Constitution.

2217
02:06:34,212 --> 02:06:36,881
Which now extinguishes slavery.

2218
02:06:36,965 --> 02:06:39,717
And with it, our economy.

2219
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:41,385
All our laws will be determined by

2220
02:06:41,470 --> 02:06:43,095
a Congress of vengeful Yankees.

2221
02:06:43,889 --> 02:06:46,432
All our rights will be subject
to a Supreme Court

2222
02:06:47,142 --> 02:06:49,143
benched by bloody Republican radicals.

2223
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:52,730
All our traditions will be obliterated.

2224
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:55,441
We won't know ourselves anymore.

2225
02:06:57,486 --> 02:06:59,904
We ain't here to discuss reconstruction.

2226
02:06:59,988 --> 02:07:02,364
We have no legal basis
for that discussion.

2227
02:07:02,449 --> 02:07:04,074
But I don't want to deal falsely.

2228
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:06,702
The Northern states
will ratify, most of them.

2229
02:07:06,787 --> 02:07:08,579
As I figure it, it remains for
two of the Southern states

2230
02:07:08,663 --> 02:07:09,705
to do the same,

2231
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:11,457
even after all are readmitted.

2232
02:07:11,541 --> 02:07:13,125
And I've been working on that.

2233
02:07:14,085 --> 02:07:15,211
Tennessee and Louisiana.

2234
02:07:15,629 --> 02:07:17,838
Arkansas, too, most likely.
It'll be ratified.

2235
02:07:18,548 --> 02:07:21,300
Slavery, sir... It's done.

2236
02:07:34,773 --> 02:07:37,525
If we submit ourselves to law, Alex,

2237
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:40,277
even submit to losing freedoms,

2238
02:07:41,696 --> 02:07:43,864
the freedom to oppress, for instance

2239
02:07:44,991 --> 02:07:46,784
we may discover other freedoms

2240
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:48,410
previously unknown to us.

2241
02:07:49,496 --> 02:07:53,040
Had you kept faith
with the democratic process,

2242
02:07:53,124 --> 02:07:54,583
as frustrating as that can be...

2243
02:07:54,668 --> 02:07:55,918
Come, sir.

2244
02:07:56,044 --> 02:07:58,546
Spare us, at least, these pieties.

2245
02:07:59,506 --> 02:08:01,090
Did you defeat us with ballots?

2246
02:08:02,551 --> 02:08:04,385
How have you held your Union together?

2247
02:08:05,387 --> 02:08:06,595
Through democracy?

2248
02:08:07,848 --> 02:08:09,598
How many hundreds
of thousands have died

2249
02:08:09,683 --> 02:08:11,100
during your administration?

2250
02:08:12,519 --> 02:08:15,145
Your Union, sir, is bonded
in cannon fire and death.

2251
02:08:18,942 --> 02:08:20,359
It may be you're right.

2252
02:08:24,781 --> 02:08:27,616
But say all we done is show the world

2253
02:08:27,701 --> 02:08:29,869
that democracy isn't chaos.

2254
02:08:32,539 --> 02:08:36,000
That there is a great, invisible strength

2255
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:37,459
in a people's union.

2256
02:08:38,378 --> 02:08:42,256
Say we've shown that a people
can endure awful sacrifice

2257
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:44,008
and yet cohere.

2258
02:08:44,634 --> 02:08:45,801
Mightn't that save at least

2259
02:08:45,886 --> 02:08:48,137
the idea of democracy to aspire to?

2260
02:08:49,598 --> 02:08:51,891
Eventually to become worthy of?

2261
02:08:56,062 --> 02:08:57,980
At all rates, whatever may be proven

2262
02:08:58,064 --> 02:09:00,274
by blood and sacrifice

2263
02:09:00,358 --> 02:09:01,901
must have been proved by now.

2264
02:09:12,287 --> 02:09:14,413
Shall we stop this bleeding?

2265
02:10:53,054 --> 02:10:54,054
Once he surrenders,

2266
02:10:54,139 --> 02:10:55,931
send his boys back to their homes

2267
02:10:56,766 --> 02:10:58,392
and their farms, their shops.

2268
02:11:00,311 --> 02:11:01,437
Yes, sir.

2269
02:11:02,772 --> 02:11:03,772
As we discussed.

2270
02:11:03,857 --> 02:11:06,066
Liberality all around, not punishment.

2271
02:11:06,151 --> 02:11:07,234
I don't want that.

2272
02:11:08,111 --> 02:11:10,988
And their leaders,
Jeff and the rest of them,

2273
02:11:11,072 --> 02:11:12,364
they escape, leave the country

2274
02:11:12,449 --> 02:11:14,950
while my back's turned,
that wouldn't upset me none.

2275
02:11:16,286 --> 02:11:18,996
When peace comes,
it mustn't just be hangings.

2276
02:11:25,462 --> 02:11:27,004
By outward appearance

2277
02:11:28,757 --> 02:11:31,550
you're 10 years older
than you were a year ago.

2278
02:11:32,093 --> 02:11:33,218
Hmm.

2279
02:11:34,888 --> 02:11:37,139
Some weariness has bit at my bones.

2280
02:11:50,612 --> 02:11:52,905
I never seen the like of it before,

2281
02:11:52,989 --> 02:11:54,490
what I seen today.

2282
02:11:56,076 --> 02:11:57,910
Never seen the like of it before.

2283
02:12:00,622 --> 02:12:02,164
You always knew that.

2284
02:12:03,583 --> 02:12:05,125
What this was going to be.

2285
02:12:06,961 --> 02:12:09,046
Intimate and ugly.

2286
02:12:12,217 --> 02:12:13,717
You must have needed to see it close

2287
02:12:13,802 --> 02:12:15,094
when you decided to come down here.

2288
02:12:16,221 --> 02:12:17,304
Hmm.

2289
02:12:34,447 --> 02:12:38,117
We've made it possible for
one another to do terrible things.

2290
02:12:40,495 --> 02:12:42,079
We've won the war.

2291
02:12:43,081 --> 02:12:46,416
Now you have to lead us out of it.

2292
02:14:18,468 --> 02:14:20,093
You have an itch to travel?

2293
02:14:20,428 --> 02:14:22,262
Mm-hmm. I'd like that.

2294
02:14:23,765 --> 02:14:26,016
To the West, by rail.

2295
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:27,476
Overseas.

2296
02:14:29,646 --> 02:14:30,812
The Holy Land.

2297
02:14:33,816 --> 02:14:35,442
Awfully pious for a man

2298
02:14:35,526 --> 02:14:38,070
who takes his wife out
buggy-riding on Good Friday.

2299
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:39,988
Jerusalem.

2300
02:14:40,573 --> 02:14:42,407
Where David and Solomon walked.

2301
02:14:42,742 --> 02:14:46,203
I dream of walking in that ancient city.

2302
02:14:52,502 --> 02:14:54,211
All anyone will remember of me

2303
02:14:54,295 --> 02:14:56,964
is I was crazy and
I ruined your happiness.

2304
02:14:57,715 --> 02:15:00,259
Anyone thinks that
doesn't understand, Molly.

2305
02:15:04,138 --> 02:15:05,639
When they look at you,

2306
02:15:07,141 --> 02:15:09,893
at what it cost to live
at the heart of this,

2307
02:15:11,396 --> 02:15:13,647
they'll wonder at it.
They'll wonder at you.

2308
02:15:13,731 --> 02:15:14,898
They should.

2309
02:15:16,234 --> 02:15:17,442
But they should also look at

2310
02:15:17,527 --> 02:15:19,069
the wretched woman by your side

2311
02:15:19,153 --> 02:15:21,989
if they want to understand
what this was truly like.

2312
02:15:23,116 --> 02:15:24,616
For the ordinary person.

2313
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:27,244
For anyone other than you.

2314
02:15:27,412 --> 02:15:29,162
You must try to be happier.

2315
02:15:30,123 --> 02:15:31,665
We must, both of us.

2316
02:15:32,208 --> 02:15:34,418
We've been so miserable for so long.

2317
02:15:44,095 --> 02:15:46,888
I did say some colored men...

2318
02:15:46,973 --> 02:15:49,433
The intelligent, the educated, and the

2319
02:15:49,517 --> 02:15:51,476
veterans. I qualified it.

2320
02:15:51,561 --> 02:15:53,061
Mr. Stevens is furious.

2321
02:15:53,146 --> 02:15:54,855
He wants to know why you qualified it.

2322
02:15:54,939 --> 02:15:57,190
No one heard
the intelligent or educated part.

2323
02:15:57,275 --> 02:15:59,318
All they heard was the first time

2324
02:15:59,402 --> 02:16:02,112
any president has ever made mention

2325
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:03,530
of Negro voting.

2326
02:16:03,906 --> 02:16:07,701
Still, I wish I'd mentioned it
in a better speech.

2327
02:16:07,785 --> 02:16:09,536
Mr. Stevens also wants to know

2328
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:11,455
why you didn't make a better speech.

2329
02:16:14,167 --> 02:16:15,459
Mrs. Lincoln is
waiting in the carriage.

2330
02:16:15,585 --> 02:16:18,045
She wants me to remind you
of the hour, and that

2331
02:16:18,129 --> 02:16:20,922
you'll have to pick up
Miss Harris and Major Rathbone.

2332
02:16:24,427 --> 02:16:26,261
- Am I in trouble?
- No, sir.

2333
02:16:26,763 --> 02:16:28,138
Thank you, Mr. Slade.

2334
02:16:43,696 --> 02:16:45,155
I suppose it's time to go.

2335
02:16:46,783 --> 02:16:48,408
Though I would rather stay.

2336
02:18:18,207 --> 02:18:20,584
The President has been shot!

2337
02:18:23,546 --> 02:18:24,796
The President

2338
02:18:24,881 --> 02:18:27,632
has been shot! At Ford's Theater!

2339
02:18:33,306 --> 02:18:35,515
No. No!

2340
02:19:09,509 --> 02:19:12,844
It's 7:22 in the morning.

2341
02:19:13,888 --> 02:19:15,597
Saturday, the 15th of April.

2342
02:19:15,681 --> 02:19:16,973
It's all over.

2343
02:19:17,058 --> 02:19:18,475
The President is no more.

2344
02:19:22,230 --> 02:19:24,189
Now he belongs to the ages.

2345
02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:32,280
Fondly do we hope,

2346
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:35,992
fervently do we pray,

2347
02:19:37,537 --> 02:19:40,497
that this mighty scourge of war,

2348
02:19:40,581 --> 02:19:42,541
may speedily pass away.

2349
02:19:45,628 --> 02:19:48,171
Yet if God wills that it continue

2350
02:19:48,798 --> 02:19:51,132
until all the wealth piled

2351
02:19:51,217 --> 02:19:54,344
by the bondman's 250 years

2352
02:19:54,428 --> 02:19:57,472
of unrequited toil shall be sunk

2353
02:19:58,808 --> 02:20:02,894
and until every drop of blood
drawn with the lash

2354
02:20:02,979 --> 02:20:06,648
shall be paid by another
drawn with the sword

2355
02:20:07,942 --> 02:20:10,318
as was said 3,000 years ago,

2356
02:20:10,403 --> 02:20:12,612
so still it must be said,

2357
02:20:13,489 --> 02:20:15,323
"The judgments of the Lord

2358
02:20:16,242 --> 02:20:20,620
"are true and righteous altogether."

2359
02:20:26,335 --> 02:20:28,044
With malice toward none,

2360
02:20:30,256 --> 02:20:32,299
with charity for all,

2361
02:20:33,968 --> 02:20:35,677
with firmness in the right,

2362
02:20:35,761 --> 02:20:38,054
as God gives us to see the right,

2363
02:20:38,139 --> 02:20:41,308
let us strive on to finish
the work we are in,

2364
02:20:42,059 --> 02:20:44,394
to bind up the nation's wounds,

2365
02:20:45,271 --> 02:20:46,730
to care

2366
02:20:47,064 --> 02:20:49,399
for him who shall have borne the battle

2367
02:20:50,693 --> 02:20:52,611
and for his widow

2368
02:20:53,237 --> 02:20:54,487
and his orphan,

2369
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:00,410
to do all which may achieve and cherish

2370
02:21:01,579 --> 02:21:06,207
a just and a lasting peace
among ourselves

2371
02:21:07,627 --> 02:21:09,669
and with all nations.
