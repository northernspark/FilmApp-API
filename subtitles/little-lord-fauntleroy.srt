1
00:00:08,924 --> 00:00:12,125
Every journey into the unfamiliar
is an adventure.

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,736
Mine even more so.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,496
I was in search of a
very special small boy.

4
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,895
I knew I wouldn't find him among
the stately mansions of the privileged.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,277
But it was totally unprepared for the
neighborhood where my search would end.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

7
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,126
What kind of child could
such a ghetto melting pot spawn?

8
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:15,981
I anticipated the worst.

9
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:17,354
Good morning, Dick.

10
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,769
 How's the boy?
 No complaints.

11
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,819
Wish I could say the same.

12
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:23,251
Jake giving you trouble again?

13
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:25,045
Give you a piece of advice, Freddie.

14
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:28,150
Don't never ever
take a drinking man for a partner.

15
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:29,413
I won't.

16
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,575
Gotta see Hobbs the grocer.
See you later Dick.

17
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:33,065
See ya.

18
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,432
Good morning, Mr. Hobbs.
Ahh.

19
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:43,445
We booted a man out of the White House.
And what happens?

20
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,196
Them Republicans in Congress
are still trying to do us in.

21
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:48,312
What're they doing now, Mr. Hobbs?

22
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,864
Doing? Nothing!
That's what they're doing!

23
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:52,872
Never a thought
for the poor working man.

24
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:55,432
Or a small tradesmen like myself.
Oh no no..

25
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:59,192
They're too busy trying to figure a way
to let the rich stuff their pockets!

26
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,251
You grow up.
You be a Democrat, you hear?!

27
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:03,595
You'll be pleased with me, Mr. Hobbs.
Right.

28
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:04,747
Now what can I do for you, sonny?

29
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:08,215
Mama says kindly fill this order.
Put it on her account.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,995
On mamaon your ma, right?

31
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:15,514
Well, have a cracker. Tit yourself
down the barrel while I see this.

32
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,028
Thanks.

33
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:20,153
How come Mary ain't doing the market?

34
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:23,700
She went to the factory to bring
more shirt work for my ma to sew.

35
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,390
Your ma is a fine lady, sunny.
Never met a dearer soul.

36
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,332
I guess that's why
my papa calls her "dearest."

37
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:32,296
I reckon so, Ceddie.

38
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,542
Keep this to yourself.

39
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:37,316
I call my ma "dearest" sometimes too.

40
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:39,216
And why wouldn't you, Ceddie?

41
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:42,311
Seeing as how she was
left a widow so young

42
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:46,313
It's kind of up to you to uhh
take your pa's place, right?

43
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,900
My papa has been gone a long time now.

44
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:51,781
Can't say I rightly remember him
much anymore.

45
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:54,044
Oh? He left his mark on you, you know.

46
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,370
You got a way of talking that
ain't exactly true blue American.

47
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:03,277
It's hardly surprising
since he was British.

48
00:03:03,361 --> 00:03:07,162
I hope you will turn it against
me that my papa was British.

49
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,616
Seeing as how you don't
like the British for much.

50
00:03:09,642 --> 00:03:11,712
By my lights, you're an American.

51
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,152
Whether your pa chooses to marry
a spunky American girl

52
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:15,301
and make him miss his country.

53
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,811
I am American!

54
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:20,940
But if you don't mind me asking, why
don't you like the British very much?

55
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,401
It ain't the common folk I don't like.

56
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:25,596
But them aristocrats!

57
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:28,696
Them that keeps the common folk
in servitude!!

58
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,556
Mark my words, Ceddie.

59
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:32,825
The day will come
when the downtrodden

60
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,493
rise in righteous wrath.

61
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:39,048
Blow all them lords
and earls and marquises sky high!

62
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,072
Maybe they wouldn't be lords and earls
and marquises if they knew any better.

63
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,417
Don't you believe it, Ceddie.
There's glory in it.

64
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:49,192
Have you ever known any aristocrats?
Not likely!

65
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:51,925
If one of them showed his ugly face
in my establishment, I'd heave him out!

66
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:55,227
I'll have no grasping tyrants
sitting on my barrels!

67
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:16,604
Just set your groceries
on the table, Ceddie.

68
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,634
All right, Mama.

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,947
Are you hungry?

70
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,516
Not now.

71
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:24,328
Mr. Hobbs treated me
to a sparkling apple.

72
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:26,395
A fine talk too.

73
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:27,653
I'm sure he did.

74
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,628
I got to your place finally.

75
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,575
Far too much for me to carry.

76
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,781
It ain't the bundles do me in.

77
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,927
It's them five flights of stairs.

78
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:38,371
And my little darling
did the marketing.

79
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:40,382
Mr. Hobbs asked after you.

80
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,068
I think he's sweet on you.

81
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:43,902
How foolish of him.

82
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:45,508
Can I go out, mama?

83
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:46,700
The boys are waiting on me.

84
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:49,005
For you. Yes, run along.

85
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:50,912
Were they pleased with the
finished waists, Mary?

86
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:54,272
And why not? Seeing you work
your fingers to the bone!

87
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,891
And doing such fine stitching.

88
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:05,522
Thank you, Captain.

89
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:15,615
Pardon me.

90
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,908
The search for the boy has led me here.

91
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:24,445
But how would the extraordinary offer
I brought be received?

92
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,475
Ceddie would not leave me.
Nor would I part with him.

93
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:28,920
Anger is expected, Mrs. Errol.

94
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,548
It's simply that the
boy's grandfather is

95
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:32,434
fixed in his determination
not to see you.

96
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:33,824
I'm well aware of that, Mr. Havisham.

97
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,890
My husband's father has never shown

98
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:38,378
the slightest concern
for me or his grandson.

99
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,452
He's an old man.
And his prejudices are very strong.

100
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,138
He always disliked
America and Americans.

101
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,216
His son's marriage to you angered him.

102
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,046
Hardly a revelation.

103
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:50,037
I must admit, I'm surprised
by your manner and appearances.

104
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,576
Pleasantly surprised.
Indeed!

105
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:56,738
However the terms of the arrangement
are not so harsh as you may think.

106
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:59,041
You're a guest in my house
and I will not be rude.

107
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:02,197
But I would prefer if you said what you
came to say and disposed of the matter.

108
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,943
You speak your mind,
don't you, Mrs. Errol? Very well.

109
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:09,281
Your son's grandfather the Earl
dislikes London.

110
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,120
He's the victim of inflammatory gout.

111
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:14,062
And intends to live
for the most part at Dorincourt.

112
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:16,492
Which is pleasantly situated
in the countryside.

113
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:19,467
Your son naturally
would also reside there.

114
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:22,466
The Earl offers you a cottage nearby.

115
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:25,593
The boy will be permitted
to visit you whenever he likes.

116
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:29,165
The Earl will neither
see you, speak with you

117
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,229
or permit you within the
gates of Dorincourt.

118
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,460
Is that all, Mr. Havisham?

119
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:41,155
Please. Surely, as a mother
you must want is best for your child.

120
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,789
What's best for Ceddie

121
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,604
is being with the dearest and sweetest
mother boy ever had!

122
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,509
I beg you to consider
your son's future, Mrs. Errol.

123
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,513
Get those kids off of the back of the

124
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,314
What's happening?
Get those kids off the back.

125
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:57,989
You're gonna fall.
You're gonna get hurt.

126
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,751
I'm sorry to make you walk
the stairs again, Mary.

127
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,306
But would you bring Ceddie, please?

128
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:24,720
Considering your financial situation,
I'm surprised you have a servant.

129
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,432
Mary isn't a servant.

130
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:28,122
She was midwife to Ceddie
when he was born.

131
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,695
And has stayed on out of devotion
although we could not pay her.

132
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:33,300
She's all the family
that Ceddie and I have.

133
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:34,522
I see.

134
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:39,644
You've not yet said whether you accept
the Earl's offer and all the terms.

135
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,877
My husband loved England.

136
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:55,151
He loved his father.

137
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:59,625
It grieved him that he was
alienated from that.

138
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,467
I will accept the terms.

139
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:17,005
But only because I know
my husband would wish it.

140
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:20,068
And I think I believe
it will be to Ceddie's benefit.

141
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:21,924
Your son will thank you one day.

142
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:23,247
I hope so.

143
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,258
However

144
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:30,057
I too have a condition
that must be met.

145
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,888
A condition?
 Yes.

146
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:35,225
And if it is violated,
I will take Ceddie and return here.

147
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,691
And the condition, Mrs. Errol?

148
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,176
That Ceddie is not to be told.

149
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:41,828
Nor is his grandfather ever
to reveal to him his dislike for me.

150
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:45,086
I will not have my child
toward between his love for me

151
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:46,935
and the affection he should feel
for his grandfather.

152
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,267
You have my word.
Your wishes will be respected.

153
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:50,244
Thank you.

154
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:53,886
It will be difficult for Ceddie to
understand why we must live apart.

155
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:56,953
But if his grandfather's kind
and loving, he will accept it.

156
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:00,182
And he will be kind and loving,
Mr. Havisham?

157
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:03,922
The old gentleman would not have
sent me on this long journey,

158
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:06,230
if his intentions towards his grandson
were not the best.

159
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:09,161
That is not an answer.
But I will accept it for now.

160
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:13,248
You're a woman of considerable
strength and purposes.

161
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:18,326
I'm a mother who's giving her child
into another's care.

162
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,191
And that care
must go beyond material things.

163
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:28,460
Me and the boys were playing
a bangup game of KicktheCan.

164
00:09:29,383 --> 00:09:31,126
This is Mr. Havisham, Ceddie.

165
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,699
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Havisham.

166
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:42,030
So. This is little Lord Fauntleroy!

167
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:52,453
It's long past your bedtime, Ceddie.

168
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:55,171
I know. But I've just been
trying to get it straight.

169
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:59,983
It is rather a lot
for a small boy to grasp.

170
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,211
Let me see
if I can explain it more clearly.

171
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,308
Your grandfather, whom you've
never met, is an Earl.

172
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,202
That's an aristocrat,
according to Mr. Hobbs.

173
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:12,627
ArisTOcrat!

174
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:14,940
His second oldest son,
your uncle Maurice,

175
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:16,651
would've become the Earl in time.

176
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,333
If he hadn't been killed
in a fall from a horse.

177
00:10:19,524 --> 00:10:23,716
His second eldest son, your uncle
Bevis, would then have become the Earl.

178
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:26,343
But he died this past year
in Rome of a tumor.

179
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:27,929
That was papa.

180
00:10:28,383 --> 00:10:31,766
So papa died too. And that leaves me.

181
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:36,319
Yes. And in time, you will be
the Earl of Dorincourt.

182
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:39,531
But until then, you're Lord Fauntleroy.

183
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:42,029
Do I have to be?

184
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,397
None of the other boys are.

185
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:46,253
It is a very great honor, Ceddie.

186
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:48,902
And it would make your papa very happy.

187
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:53,888
Well, if there's no getting out of it, I
guess I'll have to make the best of it.

188
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:55,423
And I know you will.

189
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,919
When do we have to go away?

190
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,935
Mr. Havisham is
making the arrangements.

191
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,651
And will come tomorrow
to tell us the particulars.

192
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:05,950
Mary is coming too, isn't she?

193
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:07,783
If I have to swim me way over!

194
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,853
That would be a sight.

195
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:16,806
I'm going to have a time now,
explaining what happened to Mr. Hobbs?

196
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,482
Thank you, Mrs. Grabowski.

197
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,884
Help yourself to a licorice there,
Ceddie.

198
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,334
 No, thanks.
 Huh?

199
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:30,509
Do you recall
what we talked about yesterday?

200
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:34,482
Uh, politics?

201
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:38,608
We also talked about Lords
and Earls and Marquises.

202
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,337
Recalled and entered
the conversation, yes.

203
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:45,739
Do you recall you said,

204
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,469
you wouldn't have a Lord nor a Marquis
sitting on one of your barrels?

205
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:52,889
I sure do. And I wouldn't!

206
00:11:56,979 --> 00:12:01,560
Well, there's one sitting
on your barrel right now, Mr. Hobbs.

207
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:07,723
You got a headache?
You got a pain somewhere?

208
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:10,255
I'm fine. And it's the truth, Mr. Hobbs.

209
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,742
Right now, I'm Lord Fauntleroy.

210
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:14,742
But someday, I will be an Earl.

211
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:18,955
You got some story.
I best take you home.

212
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:22,024
I'm fine. And it's the truth, Mr. Hobbs.

213
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:24,623
I wrote down my grandpa's name exactly.

214
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,251
So I could tell it to you.

215
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:36,760
"John Arthur Molyneux Errol,
Earl of Dorincourt."

216
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:41,926
All my grandpa's sons died,
including my papa.

217
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:44,042
It looks like I'm stuck with it.

218
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:49,423
 I'll be jiggered.
 I'm jiggered too, Mr. Hobbs.

219
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,661
You've been dealt a mighty low blow,
Ceddie.

220
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:58,294
I'll be glad to meet my grandpa.
That part's all right.

221
00:12:59,114 --> 00:13:03,893
But I give you my word. When I'm
an Earl someday, I won't be a tyrant.

222
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,935
It'll be an uphill fight.

223
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:08,596
But I reckon you'll make it.

224
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:11,594
Seeing as how your halfAmerican.
Best half, I have my lights.

225
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:13,111
Then we're still friends?

226
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:18,105
To the death!
In spite of your misfortune.

227
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,619
Thanks, Mr. Hobbs!

228
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:22,523
Guess this news isn't bad after all.

229
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,262
The Earl is anxious
his grandson should look forward

230
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,034
with some pleasure
to his future life in England.

231
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:34,330
And said that if he would expressed
any wishes, I should gratify them.

232
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,518
That much?

233
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:43,984
Oh, hardly an untoward sum, Mrs. Errol.

234
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,488
You must remember that a great change
has taken place in your son's life.

235
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,809
Maybe it won't be all that bad, mama.
Being an aristocrat.

236
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,518
Now if I can give Dick money
to buy out Jake.

237
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,354
And buy Mr. Hobbs
a genuine gold watch.

238
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:03,422
I guess my grandpas just about
the best person in the whole world.

239
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:08,827
Your grandfather will deny you
nothing money can purchase.

240
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:12,257
I'll be blowed!!

241
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:15,344
If that's not enough to buy Jake out,

242
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:17,620
I'll ask Mr. Havisham for more.

243
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,355
Enough? This is more than enough.

244
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:22,655
Good. Don't forget to buy
a boss sign too, Dick.

245
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:26,323
I'll be jiggered!

246
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:29,675
There's writing inside
of the genuine gold watch, Mr. Hobbs.

247
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,599
It says " From your oldest friend,
Lord Fauntleroy."

248
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,601
"from Ceddie to Mr. Hobbs."

249
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:38,615
"when this you see, remember me."

250
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,545
I ain't like to forget you.

251
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:48,275
I'm sorry. I won't be able
to become a Democrat now, Mr. Hobbs.

252
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:50,231
It's the Democrat's loss, Ceddie.

253
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,461
Well

254
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:57,263
I guess I better go.
Mr. Havisham is coming to get us.

255
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,649
I'll have to get dressed up proper.

256
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:02,612
Here. You take this for luck.

257
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:08,660
But it's your kerchief.
With lucky horseshoes.

258
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,698
You'll be needing the luck now.

259
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:13,709
You wear it when you're
with all them swells.

260
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:16,370
Thanks, Dick. I will.

261
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,305
I'll write and tell you how
it is being Lord Fauntleroy.

262
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:58,151
You usually enjoy
our morning stroll on deck.

263
00:15:58,241 --> 00:15:59,862
Is something troubling you?

264
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:02,409
My ma told me last night

265
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:06,294
she and Mary won't be living
in the same house as me and grandpa.

266
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:08,427
They will be close by.

267
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:10,621
You be able to see
your mother every day.

268
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:11,703
I know.

269
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,702
That's what my ma told me too.

270
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:18,505
But I can't figure why they can't live
in grandpa's house along with me.

271
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,205
Do you suppose this is
the reason, Mr. Havisham?

272
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:25,007
That my grandpa thinks
I ought to have a change?

273
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:27,273
Because I've been living
with ladies all my life.

274
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,699
One could assume that.

275
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:34,140
Well, that's all right.
Then it's just for a while.

276
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:39,074
You think you'll be fond
of your grandfather?

277
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:42,137
When a person does a lot for you,
it means you grab part of it.

278
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:43,984
It's found to be fun.

279
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:45,516
And he'll be fond of me.

280
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,273
Because grandpas are always
fond of their grandsons.

281
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,100
That would seem a logical assumption.

282
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:53,405
Is where we're going anything
like Hester Street, Mr. Havisham?

283
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:55,013
Like Hester Street?

284
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:58,628
I doubt you'll find any place
in England quite like Hester Street.

285
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,003
Guess I'll have to make the best of it.

286
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:02,765
Oh I don't think you'll be disappointed.

287
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:04,012
There's no place like England.

288
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:06,792
And nowhere more fair
than the English countryside.

289
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:24,435
 Is far away, Mr. Havisham?
 We should be there by nightfall.

290
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,662
Wakeup, Ceddie.

291
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,007
We're here.

292
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:59,395
Ah, Dawson's here. He's the Earl's
housekeeper, from the castle.

293
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,748
 Kindly bring in the trunk with them.
 Yes, sir.

294
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:13,472
I'll keep an eye on them.
I ain't overly trustful of foreigners.

295
00:18:13,688 --> 00:18:16,316
As you wish. This way, Mrs. Errol.

296
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:20,615
 Welcome to Court Cottage.
 Thank you.

297
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:26,092
 Good evening, Dawson.
 Hi.

298
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:43,086
I trust the journey was pleasant, ma'am?

299
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:46,124
It was.
And it's kind of you to greet us.

300
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,376
This is sure a fine house.

301
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:51,725
Dawson, this is Lord Fauntleroy.

302
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,173
Others bow and curtsy. Not you.

303
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:02,675
Oh. Sorry.

304
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:05,483
I guess I'll get it figured out in time.

305
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:08,412
I knew your father when he was
a little boy, your Lordship.

306
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,595
You're very like him.

307
00:19:09,622 --> 00:19:11,438
That's what my ma always said.

308
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:13,729
Look, Mama!

309
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:18,150
Her name is Cleo, ma'am.
I thought she might keep you company.

310
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:20,483
And she shall. Thank you.

311
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:25,152
Kindly take the trunk to the bedroom
at the head of the stairs.

312
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:26,242
Yes, ma'am.

313
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:30,344
Ceddie is so tired.
Surely, he can stay here tonight?

314
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,291
Perhaps it would be just as well.

315
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,183
I'll see you Lord Fauntleroy
is put to bed.

316
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,389
I've been seeing to him
since he came into the world.

317
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,168
And I ain't about to stop now.

318
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,185
Of course.

319
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:44,152
 Go along with Mary, Ceddie.
 Good night, mama.

320
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,654
 Good night, Mr. Havisham.
 Goodnight, My Lord.

321
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:53,246
 Good night, Mrs. Dawson.
 Just Dawson, your Lordship.

322
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:56,182
It sure don'tit doesn't
seem very polite.

323
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:11,051
The Earl has no idea
what he's taking from me.

324
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:15,553
How... difficult it is for me
to part with Ceddie.

325
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,303
This is scarcely a parting.

326
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,760
Think of it as no more than
your son going off to a nearby school.

327
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:22,656
We both know better, Mr. Havisham.

328
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:25,361
My son will only be a visitor
in his mother's house.

329
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,682
Even my house is not mine.
But his grandpa's.

330
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,363
Will you be good enough
to tell Ceddie's grandfather

331
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:34,263
I will accept no money from him?

332
00:20:34,415 --> 00:20:36,976
Surely, you cannot mean the income
that he proposes to settle on?

333
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:38,248
I do.

334
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:40,773
I must accept this house

335
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,248
because it makes it possible
for me to be near my child.

336
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,137
But I will take no money.

337
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:49,935
If he dislikes me so intensely, I should
feel as if I were selling Ceddie to him.

338
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:52,441
His Lordship will be very upset.

339
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:55,057
He will not understand.

340
00:20:55,478 --> 00:20:58,601
I'm very much afraid,
he will have to understand.

341
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,931
I'm a good seamstress.

342
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:03,408
And intend to earn
what little Mary and I will need.

343
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:07,808
I will not take money from a man
who hates me, Mr. Havisham.

344
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:11,060
And who takes my child from me,
for whatever reason.

345
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:14,368
I don't look forward
to relaying your message.

346
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:15,952
But I shall, of course.

347
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:21,920
Is that my grandpa's house?

348
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,052
That's the gatekeeper's lodge.

349
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:37,325
God bless you, Your Lordship.
Good luck and happiness to you!

350
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:39,057
To you too.

351
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,758
Now that's what I call a fine hello.
Who is she, Mr. Havisham?

352
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,616
The gatekeeper. The boys are her sons.

353
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:47,221
Do you think the boys will know
how to play KickTheCan?

354
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:48,725
If they don't,
I'll be glad to show them.

355
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,528
I doubt that you'll
be playing with them.

356
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,940
Why not?

357
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,869
As Lord Fauntleroy,
you have a position to maintain.

358
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:58,735
Being an aristocrat sure is complicated.

359
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:02,790
Is this a city park, Mr. Havisham?

360
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:06,121
This is Dorincourt.
Your grandfather's estate.

361
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:09,948
 My grandfather owns all this?
 Far more!

362
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:13,975
 Oh, he's loaded.
 Mmmhmm.

363
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,944
That's what Mr. Hobbs says.

364
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:18,865
How far to my grandfather's house now,
Mr. Havisham?

365
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:20,672
You can see the castle from here.

366
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:29,042
I'll be jiggered!

367
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:15,617
Well, shall we get on with it,
Havisham?

368
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:38,300
Lord Fauntleroy, sir.

369
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:40,199
So you're my grandson?

370
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:43,049
Mighty glad to meet you, grandpa.

371
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:47,352
 Did the trolley run over your foot?
 Trolley?

372
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:50,414
You have to be mighty careful
getting on and off those trolleys.

373
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,437
Push and shove, the devil's behind you.

374
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:56,129
Well I've not been run over
by a trolley. I suffer from gout!

375
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,754
Let's see the boy is suitably dressed.

376
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:02,975
But I'm wearing my best new knickers.

377
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,094
Hardly appropriate for Lord Fauntleroy.

378
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:09,357
Mr. Hobbs says
clothes don't make the man.

379
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,514
But I'll wear spiffy clothes
if you want me to.

380
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:14,880
In fact, we are glad to oblige.

381
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:18,756
It's such a big house.

382
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:21,636
I guess you won't feel so lonesome
now that I'm here, grandpa.

383
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:24,498
What makes you think I'm lonesome?

384
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:28,356
I don't see how not. I know I'd be.

385
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,629
It'd be better if my ma was here.

386
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,630
She'd hardly even be noticed.

387
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:38,346
Careful.

388
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:41,200
Dugal has no love for strangers.

389
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,104
I'm not a stranger. I'm your grandson.

390
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,056
At least the boy is no coward.

391
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:50,247
As you are my grandson,
we'll just have to make the best of it.

392
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,059
That's what I told Mr. Hobbs.

393
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,981
Who is Mr. Hobbs?

394
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:55,164
He's our grocer.

395
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,861
He and Dick the bootblack
are my very best friends!

396
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:02,460
Grocers, bootblacks? Hardly society.

397
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:05,953
I thought a lot about you
while I was on the big trip coming here.

398
00:26:06,053 --> 00:26:09,855
I wondered what you'd look like.
If you'd be like my papa.

399
00:26:09,955 --> 00:26:12,312
Well? Am I?

400
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:13,733
I don't think so.

401
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:14,706
You're disappointed?

402
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:16,737
No, not by a long shot.

403
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:19,380
Seeing that you're my grandpa,
you'll be nice to me.

404
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:23,334
 You think I've been nice?
 Sure have!

405
00:26:23,335 --> 00:26:26,836
You gave me money for Dick to buy out
Jake with the terrible profit.

406
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:30,063
And letting me buy Mr. Hobbs
a genuine gold watch.

407
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,575
I'd call that nice.

408
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:34,837
Your Lordship instructed me
to satisfy his desires.

409
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,449
And he chose to bestow gifts
on his friends.

410
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:40,418
If Lord Fauntleroy
would be so good as to give me

411
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:42,392
a few minutes alone
with his grandfather.

412
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:44,606
We have some business.

413
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:48,588
Don't mind one bit.
Lots to look at in here.

414
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:51,780
Oh my, Dugal.
Come on, boy. Come with me.

415
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:58,344
Boys and dogs have a natural affinity!

416
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,898
A glass of sherry for Mr. Havisham.

417
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:04,147
My fool doctor is denying me
such a pleasure.

418
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:06,484
What do you make of the boy,
Havisham?

419
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:09,831
 I find him most interesting.
 Clods can be interesting.

420
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,830
He's hardly a clod, my Lord.

421
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:13,128
Although I daresay

422
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:15,130
your Lordship will find him somewhat
different from English children.

423
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:18,210
Impudent lot from what I've heard.
American children.

424
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,527
Outspoken perhaps but not him.

425
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:23,587
I find him surprisingly mature
for one so young.

426
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:27,258
You call it maturity.
The Yanks call it precocity.

427
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:29,817
And I call it impudent.

428
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:32,566
The American blood will tell.

429
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:38,443
But I'll deal with it. And him.
After my own fashion.

430
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:41,314
You said there was something
you wished to discuss with me.

431
00:27:41,315 --> 00:27:42,833
Please get on with it.

432
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:47,390
I have a message
from your grandson's mother.

433
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:50,574
I'm not interested in the woman
or her messages.

434
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:52,626
The less I hear about her, the better.

435
00:27:52,652 --> 00:27:54,966
I'm very much afraid
you'll have to hear this, my Lord.

436
00:27:55,147 --> 00:27:57,319
She refuses to accept
the income we offered.

437
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,720
Refuses? How dare she!

438
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,500
She says because relations
between you are not friendly

439
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:03,947
Does she expect friendship?

440
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,850
That sly conniving mercenary American.

441
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:08,904
One could scarcely call her mercenary,

442
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:11,475
since she won't even accept
the money you offer.

443
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:13,362
Done for effect, Havisham.

444
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:16,258
She hopes to make me
admire her character.

445
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:17,441
A ploy, Havie!

446
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:21,279
As the boy's mother,
she has a position to maintain.

447
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:24,185
And she shall take the money
whether she likes it or not.

448
00:28:24,186 --> 00:28:25,703
Then she will not use it.

449
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:28,253
It's to be sent to her regardless.

450
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:31,006
I will not have heard telling the world

451
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:33,605
that she has to live like a pauper
because I do nothing for her.

452
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:36,245
My tenants think little enough of me
as it is.

453
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,187
I've got it.

454
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,512
She thinks to poison
the boy's mind against me.

455
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:46,975
Quite the contrary.

456
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:51,921
Mrs. Errol asks... no, demands...

457
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:54,734
nothing be said or done
that would lead Lord Fauntleroy

458
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,419
to understand you had separated him

459
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,745
from his mother
because of your dislike of her.

460
00:28:59,102 --> 00:29:00,762
He loves his mother dearly.

461
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:03,253
She's convinced this
would alienate him from you.

462
00:29:03,254 --> 00:29:04,728
Come now, Havisham.

463
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:08,788
Am I to believe she's told him
nothing of my antipathy for her?

464
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:12,676
Nothing. She wants no shadow
upon that relationship.

465
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:14,670
She wants the boy to believe you

466
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,672
the most affectionate of grandparents.

467
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:22,380
I know your intentions toward
the boy are the best, my Lord.

468
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:25,121
But your grandson's impression of you

469
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:28,033
will depend largely
on your discretion in this matter.

470
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,617
I must urge you not to speak slightly
of his mother in front of him.

471
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:34,537
That will cause me no hardship since I
don't intend to speak with her at all.

472
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,232
A glass of sherry.

473
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,495
But you said your doctor

474
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:41,244
I have a barbarian
to make into a Dorincourt!!

475
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:43,968
I need all the sustenance I can get.

476
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:45,949
Lunch to be served, my Lord.

477
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,336
I'll have my glass at the table.

478
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:51,392
Join us, Havisham?
Thank you, my Lord.

479
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:55,664
I'll help grandpa walk.

480
00:29:55,906 --> 00:29:57,606
I'm much stronger than I look.

481
00:29:57,641 --> 00:30:00,554
Just lean on me, grandpa.
I'll make it easy.

482
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:03,961
The boy's been well prepared
to ingratiate himself.

483
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:06,180
I doubt that it took
preparation, my Lord.

484
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:07,689
After all, he is a Dorincourt.

485
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,085
Not yet.

486
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:12,972
But he will be.
Before I'm through with him.

487
00:30:13,383 --> 00:30:14,875
Just lean on me, grandpa.

488
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,456
I won't let you fall.

489
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,544
I have no intention of falling.

490
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:23,389
This sure would be a fine place
to play KickTheCan.

491
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:27,367
You wouldn't have to worry
about beer wagons and trolleys.

492
00:30:35,593 --> 00:30:38,277
It's a warm day, isn't it??

493
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:02,033
I find it downright cruel, if you
don't mind me saying so, ma'am.

494
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,528
I agree.
But we can't help for it, Mellon.

495
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:07,906
Lord Fauntleroy doesn't know why
his mother can't be with him.

496
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:09,322
And he's not to be told.

497
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:11,555
That his Lordship orders.

498
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:13,657
That's a dreadful thing
to happen to her.

499
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:15,357
Keeping a widow
from her own flesh and blood.

500
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,111
You should've heard her talking
to the servants all last night.

501
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,233
She said one thing
Higgins might've liked.

502
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:23,810
Him so innocent. And like
dining with his best friend.

503
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:27,946
Best friend? His Lordship with a temper
and disposition like curdled milk.

504
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:29,385
Good morning.

505
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:35,814
Good morning, your Lordship.
I trust you slept well.

506
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:37,083
Sure did!

507
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,498
This is Mellon.
She's going to look after you.

508
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:41,277
Pleased to meet you Mrs. Mellon.

509
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:44,674
Not Mrs. Mellon, your Lordship.
Just plain Mellon.

510
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:45,872
You're not plain at all.

511
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:48,133
The and my friend Dick would say
you're smashing.

512
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:52,257
If you'll get up now, Mellon
will see to your bath and dress you.

513
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:53,991
And you can breakfast
with his Lordship.

514
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:55,432
I can dress myself.

515
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:57,984
And if you don't mind,
I'd as soon take my own bath.

516
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,177
As you wish.

517
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:02,541
Bring his Lordship
to the dining room when he's ready.

518
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:04,949
I'll just run your bath, your Lordship.

519
00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:06,922
I prefer you call me Ceddie.

520
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:09,166
It wouldn't be fitting, your Lordship.

521
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:12,322
I'm not sure I'm going to take
to being an aristocrat.

522
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:14,005
Of course you will, your Lordship.

523
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,910
Don't you think this is a big house
just for two people, Mellon?

524
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:25,901
Oh, I'll wait till you see
the horses and stables.

525
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:28,281
Think what you'll have to tell
your mama when you see them.

526
00:32:28,307 --> 00:32:31,391
It's a fact. I think
we will be great friends, Mellon.

527
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:32,909
Bless your heart, sir.

528
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,983
Do I have to wear this funny suit,
Mellon?

529
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,048
You look just elegant.

530
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:46,309
Besides, it's what his Lordship ordered.

531
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:49,472
I'm glad the boys of Hester Street
can't see me now.

532
00:32:58,571 --> 00:32:59,470
How's that?

533
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:03,236
His Lordship is awaiting
breakfast for you.

534
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:05,515
And I think you best take off the cap.

535
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:07,145
All right.

536
00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:12,067
What's in that room?

537
00:33:12,093 --> 00:33:13,495
Your playroom, your Lordship.

538
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,693
You mean I have a special room
just for playing?

539
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:19,288
Mac home my friend Sam's
whole family lives in just one room.

540
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:20,946
And there are six of them.

541
00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:35,894
 This is all mine?
 All yours.

542
00:33:36,156 --> 00:33:37,717
I wasn't here then.

543
00:33:37,743 --> 00:33:40,595
But Dawson says that all in this room
belonged to your own dear papa.

544
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:43,158
My own papa?

545
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:29,214
I guess my grandpa
loved my papa an awful lot.

546
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:33,909
I think we best go down, my Lordship.

547
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,778
The kippers not to your liking?

548
00:35:13,782 --> 00:35:16,549
I never had a fish for breakfast before.

549
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,732
 What's that?
 I never had… Never mind, grandpa.

550
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:21,134
Eat your breakfast.

551
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:23,076
I guess I'm not very hungry.

552
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:25,724
Thanks for the toys and games.

553
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,577
 What?
 Thanks for toys and games!

554
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:30,655
Oh, games are important.

555
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:34,850
They prepare a boy
for the larger game of life, I'm told.

556
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:38,639
They'll prepare you to become
the Earl of Dorincourt.

557
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,960
Becoming an Earl is pretty important.

558
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:43,900
No need to moon about it.

559
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:46,263
I wasn't.
I was just thinking about mama.

560
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:47,427
You're what?

561
00:35:47,502 --> 00:35:50,692
I never had breakfast
without mama before.

562
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:54,997
You may see your mother later today.

563
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:03,209
Pardon me, your Lordship.
The Rev. Mr. Muldaur is here.

564
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:05,463
He says the matter is urgent.

565
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:09,659
The matter is always urgent
for the Rev. Mr. Muldaur.

566
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:12,155
Show him in, Dawson.

567
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,901
I never met a reverend mister before..

568
00:36:17,902 --> 00:36:20,380
You're safe from those occasions.

569
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:22,633
Good morning, your Lordship.

570
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:24,681
Be good enough to come closer.

571
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:27,058
I see no reason for us
to shout at each other.

572
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,315
Well, what is it this time?

573
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,100
Another complaint from the parish?

574
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:38,217
Or an appeal for yet another charity?

575
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:42,391
My grandson, Lord Fauntleroy.

576
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:50,977
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
Reverend Mister Muldaur.

577
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:53,349
And yours, your Lordship.

578
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:55,042
You've come a long way.

579
00:36:55,043 --> 00:36:58,184
And many will be happy that
you've made the journey safely.

580
00:36:58,185 --> 00:36:59,783
Shall we get on with it, Muldaur?

581
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,870
Lord Fauntleroy is very much
like his father, your Lordship.

582
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:04,812
He is his father's son.

583
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:08,235
Well. Who is in trouble now, Muldaur?

584
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:11,758
It's Higgins of Abe's farm, sir.

585
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,160
He's been ill himself. And his children
both have whooping cough.

586
00:37:15,186 --> 00:37:17,215
He's now behind in his rent.

587
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:19,753
Your bailiff has told him
that he must pay or leave.

588
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:22,556
Higgins came to me yesterday
to ask if I'd intervene.

589
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:25,117
But I beg you to give him more time.

590
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:29,710
And also a small loan to buy
the medicine the children need.

591
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:32,807
Higgins is a bad tenant
and worse farmer.

592
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,410
And he's always behind in his rent.

593
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:38,300
It's true he's not a good manager
of his affairs.

594
00:37:38,326 --> 00:37:41,219
But he is in grave trouble
now, your Lordship.

595
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:44,388
If the farm is taken from him,
the family will starve.

596
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:46,828
My grandpa will never let that happen.

597
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,187
We have a philanthropist in our midst.

598
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:56,166
One who bestows largess
on bootblacks and grocers.

599
00:37:57,095 --> 00:37:59,687
A kind heart for Count Lord Fauntleroy.

600
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:02,368
In that way,
he is certainly like his father.

601
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:04,861
But unlike his grandfather?

602
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:12,478
I think you've got the kindest heart
in the whole world, grandpa.

603
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:13,877
And I ought to know.

604
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:16,756
You would help Higgins?

605
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:19,149
I can't. But I know you will.

606
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,786
Inform Higgins

607
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:25,785
he has two weeks in which
to pay his rent or forsake the farm.

608
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:28,915
I beg you to reconsider, your Lordship.

609
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,268
Good morning, Muldaur.

610
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,093
Good day, sir.

611
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:39,033
What is it?

612
00:38:39,331 --> 00:38:42,644
I bet you have a good reason
for not helping Higgins, grandpa.

613
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,248
You've not yet been taught

614
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:45,772
the responsibilities
of your future position.

615
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:47,366
But when you are,

616
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,838
you will understand that is essential
to be firm with underlings.

617
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:53,866
What's "underlings"?

618
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:55,713
Parasites, like Higgins.

619
00:38:55,977 --> 00:39:00,295
They prefer to live off charity
rather than do honest work.

620
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,724
Ahh.

621
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:05,249
If you have no wish for more breakfast,
we'll go to the stables.

622
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:08,140
 I just got a trait.
 What trait?

623
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:10,123
Why you said you are not
going to help Higgins.

624
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:12,340
Even though I know you are.
And?

625
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:15,131
Of course you are. You said it yourself.

626
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:17,597
I'm going to have
to learn responsibilities

627
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:19,447
if I'm going to become
the Earl someday.

628
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,121
You don't have to pretend
you're not going help Higgins

629
00:39:22,147 --> 00:39:24,605
just so I can learn
responsibilities, grandpa.

630
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:27,337
Come, we'll go to the stables.

631
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:29,892
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go see mama first.

632
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:33,024
There's a pony in the stables.

633
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:35,440
Your own pony.

634
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:37,385
My own pony!

635
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,759
You give me everything, grandpa!

636
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:41,562
But I'll go see mama first.

637
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:51,763
Sure got lots to tell dearest.

638
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,279
Dearest? What's dearest?

639
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:57,811
I guess I can tell you,
since you're my grandpa.

640
00:39:57,837 --> 00:40:00,101
I already told Mr. Hobbs.

641
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,090
I call mama "dearest" sometimes.

642
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:04,886
Because that's what
papa used to call her.

643
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,549
I can't wait to tell Mama about all
the things you've given me, grandpa.

644
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:11,441
I think you're the best grandpa
in the whole world!

645
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,852
 Know what I just thought of, grandpa?
 What?

646
00:40:14,853 --> 00:40:17,641
What people really don't
understand about aristocrats.

647
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:20,562
I'm going to write to Mr. Hobbs
and set him straight.

648
00:40:20,563 --> 00:40:25,550
I gather you're Mr. Hobbs has
a low opinion of aristocrats.

649
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:28,794
Well, he thinks they're tyrants.

650
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,414
That's because he doesn't know
any of them.

651
00:40:31,415 --> 00:40:33,554
So I'm going to tell them
that you're the best ever.

652
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,242
And when I grow up,
I wanna be just like you.

653
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:40,761
It's a joy to me
now that I'm going to be an Earl.

654
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:43,708
I can't become a Democrat
or become president.

655
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,865
Which is what Mr. Hobbs
had in mind for me.

656
00:40:45,866 --> 00:40:48,796
President?
You will go to the House of Lords!

657
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,035
Is it just as good as being President?

658
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:54,594
Poor child. Infinitely superior!

659
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:05,819
Go on there.

660
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:10,837
Come on. Come on.

661
00:41:16,354 --> 00:41:17,278
Whoa.

662
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,009
I'll get out first.
Then you can lean on me, grandpa.

663
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:22,608
I'm not getting out.

664
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:25,109
You're not going to see Mama?

665
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:28,687
I've important business to attend to.

666
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:30,706
Mama will be very disappointed.

667
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:35,346
Hustings will come for you
in two hours time.

668
00:41:35,347 --> 00:41:36,695
Go ahead.

669
00:41:50,736 --> 00:41:53,137
 Oh, Ceddie!
 Mama!

670
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,419
Home, Hustings.

671
00:42:07,246 --> 00:42:08,326
 How are you?
 Fine.

672
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:11,379
 Did you sleep well?
 Yeah, I have a huge bed!

673
00:42:11,412 --> 00:42:12,759
And you're happy?

674
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:24,335
Lord Fauntleroy sits well, my Lord.

675
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:26,765
All Dorincourts sit well.

676
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,503
 Can I go faster, grandpa?
 You're not afraid?

677
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:31,922
Not by a long shot.

678
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,497
Let him have the reins.

679
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:41,554
Come on! Faster, come on!

680
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,076
Thighs in the stirrup, your Lordship.

681
00:42:47,102 --> 00:42:49,565
I'm running him every time.

682
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:52,277
That will do, Wilkins!

683
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:54,924
Can I go for a real ride, grandpa?

684
00:42:55,337 --> 00:42:57,279
I'll keep a watchful eye on him,
your Lordship.

685
00:42:57,305 --> 00:42:58,625
See that you do.

686
00:42:58,651 --> 00:42:59,856
Charlie.

687
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:01,796
Whoa.

688
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:05,818
Whoa.

689
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:09,893
Bye, grandpa!

690
00:43:17,365 --> 00:43:19,584
He sure is spunky, your Lordship.

691
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,517
Get on with your work.

692
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:29,779
Whoa... whoa.

693
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:31,532
Have you had enough, your Lordship?

694
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:32,675
Not by a long shot!

695
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:36,597
Hold still.
I almost forgot my cap though.

696
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,357
Let's go. Come on.

697
00:44:02,216 --> 00:44:04,131
You got a long way to go?

698
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:06,590
The boy lives in the village,
your Lordship.

699
00:44:07,718 --> 00:44:11,019
It's him!
It's him that's come from America!

700
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,242
Give him a hand up on my pony, Wilkins.

701
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:14,592
Your Lordship?

702
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,882
He can't walk very well. And I can.

703
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:18,974
Here, ride my mount.

704
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:20,410
It's too big for him.

705
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:23,823
Give him a hand, Wilkins. Please.

706
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:30,795
What's your name?

707
00:44:30,821 --> 00:44:34,064
Georgie. Georgie Hawker.

708
00:44:34,327 --> 00:44:36,223
Pleased to meet you, Georgie.

709
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:37,902
So let's go.

710
00:44:40,197 --> 00:44:42,892
Won't his Lordship give me what for.

711
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:11,963
Mrs. Dibble, Dibble! Look!

712
00:45:12,436 --> 00:45:15,212
What? Ah, it must be him.

713
00:45:15,238 --> 00:45:17,325
It's little Lord Fauntleroy!

714
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:18,467
How do?

715
00:45:19,738 --> 00:45:21,715
He knows Georgie.

716
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:24,640
 Can I put here?
 Yes.

717
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,510
I'll be back in a minute.

718
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,263
 Excuse me.
 Yes?

719
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:38,082
You put things on account?

720
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:39,862
That depends on whose account.

721
00:45:39,964 --> 00:45:42,567
My grandpa, the Earl of Dorincourt.

722
00:45:42,593 --> 00:45:43,987
So I guess his credit's good.

723
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:45,430
The Earl?

724
00:45:45,765 --> 00:45:48,852
Then you must be...
little Lord Fauntleroy!

725
00:45:48,853 --> 00:45:51,440
Would I be wearing this getup
if I wasn't?

726
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:55,564
He wouldn't let the boy ride
my mount, your Lordship.

727
00:45:55,846 --> 00:45:57,385
He said it was too high.

728
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:00,641
"Wilkins," he says.

729
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,534
"The boy is lame and I am not."

730
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:10,524
Then... he bought a crutch
for the boy from Mr. Kinsey.

731
00:46:10,752 --> 00:46:13,291
And then when we got to the cottage,

732
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:15,479
he whips off his cap
and says to the boy's mother,

733
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:17,474
"I've brought your son home, ma'am."

734
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,954
"And the crutch is from...
my grandpa."

735
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:24,731
If you don't mind my saying so,
your Lordship,

736
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:26,856
The Lord Fauntleroy has won the hearts

737
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:28,952
of the whole village
with what he's done.

738
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:44,330
You could've knocked
me down with a feather

739
00:46:44,356 --> 00:46:46,927
when he asked to buy
those crutches for little Georgie.

740
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:48,499
Such a lovely child.

741
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:49,745
He took my breath away.

742
00:46:49,746 --> 00:46:51,893
He looks so like his father.

743
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:54,472
And a dearer man never lived
than Captain Errol!

744
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:58,311
I wish one of my own could live
with the Earl of Dorincourt.

745
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:01,687
Look, that's his mother.

746
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,740
Isn't she in luck?

747
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:07,184
Bless you, my lady.

748
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,876
There's no reason for you to curtsy.
But I thank you for your blessing.

749
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:18,214
It's very nice of you to be here,
Mrs. Errol.

750
00:47:23,724 --> 00:47:25,859
I'll help grandpa walk.

751
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:35,115
He's his father all over again.

752
00:47:36,702 --> 00:47:39,421
Everybody's sure glad
to see you, grandpa.

753
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:42,268
 They're bowing to you.
 To me?

754
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:43,653
Take off your hat.

755
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,698
God bless your young Lordship
and a long life for you.

756
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:49,003
Thanks. You too.

757
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:51,078
What is it, Higgins?

758
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:55,522
You're Higgins?
Sure pleased to meet you, Mr. Higgins.

759
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,075
I guess you feel a lot better

760
00:47:57,076 --> 00:47:59,891
now that my grandpa said that
you can stay on the farm.

761
00:48:01,824 --> 00:48:04,570
But I guess you know
how good my grandpa is.

762
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,987
You look poorly and should be in bed.

763
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:13,321
When you're fit again,
see that you do better with the farm.

764
00:48:13,322 --> 00:48:14,446
Thanks, your Lordship.

765
00:48:14,472 --> 00:48:17,648
I hope your children get over
their whooping cough, Mr. Higgins.

766
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:20,681
You sure made Mr. Higgins happy,
grandpa.

767
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:23,308
I'm sure learning how to be an Earl!

768
00:48:39,206 --> 00:48:41,902
Mama and Mary came to church too,
grandpa.

769
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:44,006
Why don't we sit with them?

770
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,217
Our place is in the family pew.

771
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:49,469
But Mama and Mary are family too.

772
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:16,480
What's that, Grandpa?

773
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:20,703
A memorial to our ancestors.

774
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,471
They don't know how to spell
no better than me.

775
00:49:31,764 --> 00:49:34,735
We shall now sing Hymn 298.

776
00:49:35,022 --> 00:49:37,434
"Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven."

777
00:49:38,695 --> 00:49:44,163
Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven.

778
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:48,984
To His feet thy tribute bring.

779
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:53,623
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,

780
00:49:53,876 --> 00:49:58,589
Who like me His praise should sing:

781
00:49:58,831 --> 00:50:01,312
Praise Him, Praise Him.

782
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:03,906
Praise Him, Praise Him.

783
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:09,204
Praise the everlasting King.

784
00:51:28,508 --> 00:51:30,035
You for work?

785
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:32,118
I'm a good seamstress, Mrs. Smith.

786
00:51:32,193 --> 00:51:33,883
You're his Lordship's mother!

787
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,521
I'm also my own person.

788
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:37,483
Of course if you have no need for help

789
00:51:37,509 --> 00:51:41,298
I have this need. I'm the only
dressmaker for miles around.

790
00:51:42,685 --> 00:51:44,405
What would the Earl think?

791
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:47,154
That does not concern me.
I have a living to make.

792
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:49,661
I prefer of course
to do the sewing at home.

793
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:51,830
As it's a long walk to the village.

794
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:53,624
It doesn't surprise me, my lady.

795
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,812
What doesn't surprise you?

796
00:51:54,838 --> 00:51:56,740
That the young captain married you.

797
00:51:57,089 --> 00:51:59,484
Thank you. Will you take me on?

798
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:01,116
With pleasure, my lady.

799
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:04,917
And you will do me a kindness
if you cease to call me "my lady."

800
00:52:05,184 --> 00:52:06,523
I'm Mrs. Errol..

801
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,550
It's all the title
I want or have ever wanted.

802
00:52:08,591 --> 00:52:10,564
Then Mrs. Errol, it shall be.

803
00:52:12,887 --> 00:52:14,876
I took a wrong turn
on the way to the village.

804
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,041
Came to a sector..

805
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:19,288
I've never seen
such poverty and despair.

806
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:21,471
The houses were all decayed.

807
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:24,050
There was an open ditch
with a stench that took my breath away.

808
00:52:24,405 --> 00:52:27,406
Earl's Lane..
It's where his Lordship sentences them.

809
00:52:27,506 --> 00:52:31,107
It's best to stay away.
There's always terrible sickness there.

810
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:34,208
It comes from hunger and filth.

811
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:15,708
 Look it over.
 Fine bird, Mr. McGregor.

812
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:18,217
I'll wager you'll be pleased
to do your own shooting again, my Lord.

813
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,739
Keep an eye out for poachers,
Mr. McGregor.

814
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:21,467
Yes, my Lord.

815
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:24,507
I'll not have my birds in end up
on the tables of the tenants.

816
00:53:24,582 --> 00:53:27,239
The signs are posted.
And all know the penalty. But

817
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:29,379
Some people's hunger, your Lordship.

818
00:53:29,484 --> 00:53:32,251
Those who don't work
deserve to go hungry.

819
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:34,120
Take the birds to the kitchen, McGregor.

820
00:53:34,146 --> 00:53:35,536
Yes, my Lord.

821
00:53:37,796 --> 00:53:39,604
Good afternoon, sir.

822
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:42,139
Hustings.

823
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,233
Be good enough to inform the lady

824
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:46,349
I have no desire to converse with her.

825
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:48,030
Kindly inform his Lordship

826
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:50,724
that an exchange of "good afternoon"
hardly constitutes a conversation.

827
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,087
Tell the lady

828
00:53:52,113 --> 00:53:56,017
that she is sadly mistaken if she
hopes to ingratiate herself with me.

829
00:53:56,018 --> 00:53:57,485
Please tell his Lordship

830
00:53:57,511 --> 00:54:00,044
I have no desire or need
to ingratiate myself.

831
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:02,583
He is my husband's father
and my son's grandfather.

832
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:04,668
And I merely show him the
same courtesy I would

833
00:54:04,694 --> 00:54:07,080
show his gamekeeper
if the circumstance were the same.

834
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,428
Tell the lady

835
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:11,508
that like all Americans,
she is exceedingly rude.

836
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:12,873
Tell his Lordship that it's obvious

837
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,875
Americans do not have
a monopoly on rudeness.

838
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:16,826
Tell the lady she offends me.

839
00:54:16,827 --> 00:54:18,180
Tell his Lordship I certainly hope so.

840
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:19,672
Tell the lady

841
00:54:19,722 --> 00:54:21,255
The lady has heard quite enough,
Hustings.

842
00:54:21,281 --> 00:54:24,805
I thank God each day
for the Revolution that freed us from

843
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:26,661
the arrogance and ill temper
of the British aristocracy.

844
00:54:26,724 --> 00:54:27,317
Madam!!

845
00:54:27,343 --> 00:54:30,050
We won that war. And I have
no intention of losing this one.

846
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,122
Good day, Hustings!

847
00:54:32,205 --> 00:54:34,119
Shall I just drive on, your Lordship?

848
00:54:34,716 --> 00:54:38,171
I want no gossip
about this conversation, Hustings.

849
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,376
What conversation?
Was that yours, sir?

850
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:41,649
Drive on.

851
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:55,321
Shouldn't Mama be home by now, Mary?

852
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:58,645
She must've stopped by that awful
place again to help out like she does.

853
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,492
Seems a mistake.
She'll come watch you when she can.

854
00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:06,560
Is mama happy, Mary?

855
00:55:06,843 --> 00:55:08,598
She never says.

856
00:55:09,216 --> 00:55:11,073
Sure, she's happy.

857
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,743
Or she would pack up and go home.

858
00:55:13,965 --> 00:55:15,334
But not without me.

859
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,498
You'd be the first thing she'd pack.

860
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:19,491
I'm sorry that I made you wait, Ceddie.

861
00:55:19,492 --> 00:55:20,358
Mama!

862
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:22,796
Mary told me where you were.

863
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:24,293
New or alterations?

864
00:55:24,294 --> 00:55:25,609
Alterations.

865
00:55:26,394 --> 00:55:27,708
I'll fix you a cup of tea.

866
00:55:33,104 --> 00:55:36,606
 You look awful tired, mama.
 I'm fine.

867
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:38,909
Do you realize we've
been here a whole month?

868
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,346
 A month?
 Mmmmmm.

869
00:55:40,347 --> 00:55:41,686
I haven't even wrote

870
00:55:41,687 --> 00:55:43,686
I haven't written
to Mr. Hobbs and Dick yet.

871
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:45,352
I'm going to do it
as soon as I get back.

872
00:55:45,353 --> 00:55:47,785
Has your grandfather said anything
yet about your schooling?

873
00:55:48,106 --> 00:55:49,833
He says I'm going to have a tutor.

874
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:51,464
Why can't I just finish school?

875
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:55,161
I suppose because it takes
special training to become a Lord.

876
00:55:55,236 --> 00:55:58,089
Sometimes I would just as soon
not become one.

877
00:55:58,115 --> 00:56:00,081
Not if we can't live in the same house.

878
00:56:00,082 --> 00:56:02,259
You promised you would accept it
without question.

879
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:04,697
Someday you'll understand.

880
00:56:04,855 --> 00:56:07,082
I guess. But I sure don't now.

881
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:10,370
When you're the Earl of Dorincourt,

882
00:56:10,396 --> 00:56:13,683
you'll be brave and kind.
And do only good for others.

883
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:17,734
The world will be a little bit
better because a man has lived.

884
00:56:25,562 --> 00:56:26,611
Good morning.

885
00:56:26,612 --> 00:56:28,800
Your foot's better, grandpa.

886
00:56:28,826 --> 00:56:30,625
My gout has receded.

887
00:56:30,651 --> 00:56:32,335
That's fine, grandpa.

888
00:56:32,336 --> 00:56:34,352
I know it must've hurt an awful lot.

889
00:56:35,404 --> 00:56:38,524
I guess that's why you were
grumpy sometimes, grandpa.

890
00:56:39,601 --> 00:56:40,924
Probably.

891
00:56:43,223 --> 00:56:45,794
May I inquire what you are writing?

892
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,950
It's a letter to Mr. Hobbs and Dick.

893
00:56:48,025 --> 00:56:49,209
I should've done it before.

894
00:56:49,235 --> 00:56:52,051
But "Better late than never"
Mr. Hobbs says.

895
00:56:52,126 --> 00:56:55,011
Quite a philosopher, your Mr. Hobbs.

896
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,753
That's what mama says too.

897
00:56:57,322 --> 00:56:59,735
I had a fine dinner with Mama yesterday.

898
00:56:59,761 --> 00:57:01,349
And you know what else she said?

899
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,608
"The world should feel a little
better because a man has lived."

900
00:57:05,144 --> 00:57:08,350
I think the world will be a lot
better because you lived, grandpa.

901
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:09,870
Thank you.

902
00:57:12,246 --> 00:57:15,187
My fool doctor tells me
I may ride again.

903
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,839
You will accompany me tomorrow?

904
00:57:18,082 --> 00:57:19,999
That'll be fine, grandpa.

905
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:21,925
Now I'd better finish my letter.

906
00:57:26,856 --> 00:57:28,185
Dugal.

907
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:38,827
"So you see, it's a mistake about
earls being tyrants.

908
00:57:40,096 --> 00:57:43,444
"It's only that they are the top man.
So they get blamed a lot.

909
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,160
"But then you never knew any earls.

910
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:49,078
"So I can see how you wouldn't
have a firsthand idea.

911
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:53,567
"My grandpa has gout in his foot which
makes him cranky. But he is better now.

912
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:54,956
"I love him very much.

913
00:57:54,982 --> 00:57:59,294
"And so do almost all
of the people who work on his land.

914
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:01,554
"Which are called 'tenants.'

915
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:05,053
"Which is different from being
a tenant on Hester Street.

916
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,549
 Make any sense to you?
 Nothing.

917
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,202
They call them tenants over there, huh?

918
00:58:09,228 --> 00:58:12,759
It still means "them which is in
servitude to the aristocrats"!

919
00:58:12,884 --> 00:58:14,037
Let me get on with it.

920
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:17,727
"The only thing is mama and Mary
don't live with grandpa and me.

921
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,155
"But they got a fine house
all to themselves.

922
00:58:21,935 --> 00:58:23,722
"I'd as soon they live with us.

923
00:58:24,577 --> 00:58:25,879
"Well, that's that.

924
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,381
"Please write a letter to me.
And give my regards to the boys.

925
00:58:28,407 --> 00:58:29,786
"I miss you and Dick.

926
00:58:29,812 --> 00:58:32,654
There is a dungeon, uhh...
under the castle.

927
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,961
"But my grandpa never put
anyone in there." Oh, yeah?

928
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:38,529
"Your old friend Ceddie.
Lord Fauntleroy.

929
00:58:38,691 --> 00:58:41,167
"PS, I have to sign it that way."

930
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:43,539
I call it queer.

931
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,676
Ceddie's ma and Mary aren't
living in the same house with him.

932
00:58:46,702 --> 00:58:49,668
Queer? What I call it ain't
fit for public consumption.

933
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,139
You don't appear to be
enjoying your ride today.

934
00:58:55,025 --> 00:58:56,876
I was thinking about mama.

935
00:58:56,902 --> 00:58:59,482
You're free to see her
whenever you wish.

936
00:58:59,826 --> 00:59:02,885
I know.
But don't you miss not seeing mama?

937
00:59:02,911 --> 00:59:05,953
Since I don't know her
I can't say I miss seeing her.

938
00:59:06,228 --> 00:59:07,715
I thought maybe you'd want to.

939
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:11,155
Mama said I mustn't ask you
any questions. So I won't.

940
00:59:11,513 --> 00:59:13,199
I miss her most at night.

941
00:59:13,355 --> 00:59:14,686
I look out my window.

942
00:59:14,687 --> 00:59:17,254
Mama puts a lamp there for me to see.

943
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,986
I'm a long way off. I know what it says.

944
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,864
It says "good night and God's with you."

945
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:25,016
That's what my ma
used to say to me every night.

946
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,007
We'll go to the promontory today.

947
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:30,112
There's something you should see.

948
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:40,630
All this will be yours one day.

949
00:59:41,354 --> 00:59:42,874
Mine? When?

950
00:59:44,074 --> 00:59:46,102
When you're the Earl of Dorincourt.

951
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:47,632
When I'm dead.

952
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,485
But then I don't want it.

953
00:59:53,044 --> 00:59:54,763
I don't want you to be dead.

954
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:56,338
Kind of you to say so.

955
00:59:57,507 --> 00:59:59,660
What's way over there, grandpa?

956
01:00:00,136 --> 01:00:03,792
That's where my tenants live.
It's called Earl's Lane.

957
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,578
I'd like to see it.

958
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:10,062
I don't suppose I've been down there
in 20 years.

959
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:13,689
I think I better see it as long
as it's going to be mine someday.

960
01:01:24,832 --> 01:01:26,400
Bless you, Lord.

961
01:01:26,426 --> 01:01:28,859
And your sweet mother.

962
01:01:29,298 --> 01:01:31,819
Comes like an angel of mercy.

963
01:01:31,845 --> 01:01:35,135
To bring food and see to the sick.

964
01:01:44,813 --> 01:01:49,801
When you're the Earl, see to it that you
are more responsible than I have been.

965
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,552
Whose lane is to be renovated?

966
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:01,678
Every miserable cottage.

967
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:07,020
And I've given the bailiff instructions
for that stinking ditch to be filled in.

968
01:02:08,532 --> 01:02:10,985
It will improve
the value of the property.

969
01:02:11,011 --> 01:02:12,147
Surely.

970
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:27,350
Hey, who'd think anyone
could sop the heart of that old tyrant.

971
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:29,252
Sopping? No. Shaming!

972
01:03:01,548 --> 01:03:03,450
You wish to see me your Lordship?

973
01:03:03,476 --> 01:03:06,182
This is a list of the guests be invited.

974
01:03:06,265 --> 01:03:08,391
Guests? For what, your Lordship?

975
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,391
I intend to give a dinner party.

976
01:03:10,466 --> 01:03:13,385
To mark the renovation of Earl's Lane.

977
01:03:14,367 --> 01:03:16,821
No need to look as if the world
were coming to an end.

978
01:03:16,847 --> 01:03:18,120
No, my Lord.

979
01:03:18,351 --> 01:03:21,054
It's just that we've not
had a dinner party for 20 years.

980
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,608
Better late than never.

981
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:24,463
Where have I heard that before?

982
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:29,001
Lady Lorradaile!

983
01:03:29,027 --> 01:03:31,988
Yes, Dawson, my sister! Lady Lorradaile.

984
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:34,865
And Sir Harry.

985
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:37,753
Yes, sir.

986
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,021
"No need to look like the world is
coming to an end" his Lordship says.

987
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:44,676
A dinner party here?!

988
01:03:45,046 --> 01:03:47,783
What's more, Lady Lorradaile is invited.

989
01:03:47,784 --> 01:03:50,809
What? They haven't exchanged
a word in 20 years!

990
01:03:50,835 --> 01:03:53,410
His Lordship is proud as a Derby cock.

991
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,258
Thomas, the guest list.

992
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:56,696
Take it to the top stationary.

993
01:03:56,787 --> 01:03:59,688
His Lordship wants the invitations
written in his best text.

994
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:02,497
Mellon, a new velvet
suit is to be ordered

995
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,014
for Lord Fauntleroy forthrrghtly.

996
01:04:04,451 --> 01:04:06,832
The guestrooms are to be
aired and ready.

997
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:09,653
And the castle is to be scrubbed
and polished from top to bottom.

998
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:13,804
Wilkins will ensure the carriages,
horses and stables are ever good.

999
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:18,598
As for myself, I intend to lie down
to get over the shock.

1000
01:05:16,488 --> 01:05:19,289
"And the Queen asked the magic mirror."

1001
01:05:19,324 --> 01:05:23,190
"Mirror mirror on the wall, who's
the most beautiful of them all?"

1002
01:05:23,282 --> 01:05:25,510
"And mirror replied..."

1003
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:38,011
You're wrong again. Ill show you.

1004
01:05:38,095 --> 01:05:41,296
You have to beat that!

1005
01:05:47,098 --> 01:05:49,599
Strike, Grandpa! You win.

1006
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:11,106
Go fetch it! Good boy!
Come on, Dugal, come on.

1007
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:14,867
Cedric is my only grandson, Havisham.

1008
01:07:14,893 --> 01:07:16,217
The woman is a fraud.

1009
01:07:16,218 --> 01:07:18,409
Quite possibly, my Lord.
But we must be certain.

1010
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:20,395
Have I your permission
to use a private detective?

1011
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:21,518
Dammit, man.

1012
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:25,005
No stone is to be left unturned which
would expose this Minna Boggs

1013
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:26,812
as the imposter she is.

1014
01:07:27,258 --> 01:07:30,035
To say my son Bevis married her?

1015
01:07:30,036 --> 01:07:32,706
Some eight years ago.
And that the child resulted from it.

1016
01:07:32,866 --> 01:07:36,297
Now she claims that it is her son,
not Cedric, is the rightful heir.

1017
01:07:36,372 --> 01:07:38,108
Wicked nonsense, Havisham!

1018
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:40,281
I sincerely hope that is the case.

1019
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:43,565
What manner of woman is she?

1020
01:07:43,591 --> 01:07:46,153
In appearance, she's handsome
in a coarse sort of way.

1021
01:07:46,402 --> 01:07:49,063
At our first brief meeting,
I got that she was a dancer,

1022
01:07:49,064 --> 01:07:52,124
who came to England
with some tawdry American company.

1023
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:55,949
Uneducated and openly mercenary, I fear.

1024
01:07:56,496 --> 01:08:00,243
I've no doubt there may have been
an alliance of sorts.

1025
01:08:00,528 --> 01:08:05,430
Bevis rarely showed discrimination
in his choice of dalliance.

1026
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:09,054
But marriage to a woman of that sort.

1027
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,549
That I do not believe.

1028
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:14,659
Put your investigator to work, Havisham.

1029
01:08:15,116 --> 01:08:17,532
Dugal finally got the hunting right,
Grandpa.

1030
01:08:17,558 --> 01:08:19,482
Pretty sure chewed up my ball.

1031
01:08:20,542 --> 01:08:22,453
We'll find another ball.

1032
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:23,997
You're looking very fit,
Lord Fauntleroy.

1033
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:25,093
I'm trying to be fitter.

1034
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,524
I think grandpa looks fit too.

1035
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:30,424
That's because we ride every day.
It's good for us.

1036
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:33,722
Have I told you how dear
you've become to me, Cedric?

1037
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:38,511
You don't have to tell me, grandpa.
I know without you're saying.

1038
01:08:39,652 --> 01:08:42,653
Your whole day early
for the party, Mr. Havisham.

1039
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:45,445
But better early
than not at all, I always say.

1040
01:08:45,446 --> 01:08:47,848
Unfortunately,
I shall have to miss the party.

1041
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,187
I must return to London.

1042
01:08:49,188 --> 01:08:51,716
I won't detain you any
longer, Havisham.

1043
01:08:51,742 --> 01:08:53,239
I wish you every success.

1044
01:08:53,265 --> 01:08:54,840
It will be our success, my Lord.

1045
01:08:56,537 --> 01:08:57,881
Lord Fauntleroy.

1046
01:08:58,948 --> 01:09:01,940
No stone left unturned, Havisham.

1047
01:09:03,049 --> 01:09:05,107
Not the smallest pebble, my Lord.

1048
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:11,349
Mr. Havisham's your best friend,
isn't he, grandpa?

1049
01:09:11,441 --> 01:09:13,189
Mr Hobbs always says:

1050
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,549
"When push comes to shove,

1051
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:17,790
"here's nothing like having
a true blue friend in your court."

1052
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:37,547
Welcome, Your Ladyship... Sir Harry.

1053
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,847
You never thought you'd
see me come through

1054
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:41,438
these doors again, did you, Dawson?

1055
01:09:42,143 --> 01:09:43,313
You haven't changed.

1056
01:09:43,314 --> 01:09:45,237
Nor have you, my lady.

1057
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:46,950
Fiddlesticks! I'm like a mummy!

1058
01:09:48,235 --> 01:09:49,547
Where is my brother?

1059
01:09:49,548 --> 01:09:51,609
Waiting for you in the library, my lady.

1060
01:09:51,635 --> 01:09:53,866
 And the boy?
 As soon as you get here.

1061
01:09:53,867 --> 01:09:57,428
I'm to bring him to you in the library
as soon as you arrive, my lady.

1062
01:09:57,612 --> 01:10:00,996
Harry fears the lion in his den.

1063
01:10:01,022 --> 01:10:02,238
Please.

1064
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,873
 Constancia.
 Molyneux.

1065
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:15,180
Harry.

1066
01:10:16,118 --> 01:10:17,564
You look well, Constancia.

1067
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:20,044
And you look better
than when I last saw you.

1068
01:10:20,419 --> 01:10:22,736
I was surprised to get your invitation.

1069
01:10:22,762 --> 01:10:24,748
But so very pleased.

1070
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:27,732
I regret our estrangement.

1071
01:10:27,733 --> 01:10:31,635
It was a foolish quarrel
over an inconsequential matter.

1072
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:34,693
For the life of me, I can't recall
the reason for our fracas.

1073
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,188
Of no consequence.

1074
01:10:40,718 --> 01:10:43,849
Fables... Now tell me about the boy.

1075
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,962
He's all Dorincourt!

1076
01:10:46,419 --> 01:10:49,005
And I challenge anyone to dispute it.

1077
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:50,663
You're fond of him?

1078
01:10:51,696 --> 01:10:53,048
He's a fine boy.

1079
01:10:54,197 --> 01:10:56,721
Cedric! Come here!

1080
01:10:57,815 --> 01:11:00,124
I am your great Aunt Constancia.

1081
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:07,290
I adored your father.
And you're so like him.

1082
01:11:07,488 --> 01:11:09,527
This is your great Uncle Harry.

1083
01:11:09,602 --> 01:11:11,530
Pleased to meet you, Uncle Harry.

1084
01:11:11,556 --> 01:11:14,115
Well, Cedric. Are you happy here?

1085
01:11:14,116 --> 01:11:17,004
It took a little while for me
and grandpa to get acquainted.

1086
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:18,443
But we are fine friends now.

1087
01:11:18,518 --> 01:11:20,031
We are indeed.

1088
01:11:20,057 --> 01:11:23,100
You'll be amplifying the conversation
after your lessons.

1089
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:26,140
I'm learning how to talk French.
It's pretty tricky.

1090
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:27,753
Run along now.

1091
01:11:28,503 --> 01:11:31,059
You actually dote on the boy,
you old curmudgeon.

1092
01:11:31,085 --> 01:11:32,530
Nonsense.

1093
01:11:32,605 --> 01:11:35,496
Most children are idiots or bores.

1094
01:11:35,522 --> 01:11:37,931
It so happens that Cedric is neither.

1095
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:40,638
Surely, his mother deserves
some credit for that.

1096
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:42,233
I prefer not to discuss it.

1097
01:11:42,308 --> 01:11:46,009
Oh? I understand your tenants adore her.

1098
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:48,606
It's the boy who's won their affection.

1099
01:11:48,876 --> 01:11:53,078
But I have to admit his mother
has brought him up well.

1100
01:11:53,616 --> 01:11:56,218
I should like to visit
Cedric's mother this afternoon.

1101
01:11:56,244 --> 01:11:58,442
That is entirely up to you to design.

1102
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:01,856
What is it, Dawson?

1103
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,386
I thought Lady Lorradaile
and Sir Harry might prefer

1104
01:12:04,412 --> 01:12:06,770
tea in their rooms
after their long journey.

1105
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,752
Tea and some of those
delicious cucumber and

1106
01:12:09,778 --> 01:12:11,547
crest sandwiches for
which you are famous.

1107
01:12:13,069 --> 01:12:16,871
After 20 years, our first meeting
deserves a kiss.

1108
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:19,640
There.

1109
01:12:19,666 --> 01:12:21,721
I share your happiness, Molyneux.

1110
01:12:21,927 --> 01:12:24,473
Cedric is an enchanting child.

1111
01:12:24,797 --> 01:12:26,434
Come, Harry.

1112
01:12:48,226 --> 01:12:50,719
 No!
 My Lord?

1113
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,812
Cedric is the rightful heir!

1114
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:57,522
I'll accept no other.

1115
01:13:00,534 --> 01:13:02,816
I wish you to know
that I entirely disapprove

1116
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:05,216
of my brother's treatment of you.

1117
01:13:05,497 --> 01:13:07,665
I accept it for Ceddie's sake, ma'am.

1118
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:09,542
And his father's.

1119
01:13:09,543 --> 01:13:11,294
I made scones.

1120
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:14,810
I never understand what
folks here see in them.

1121
01:13:16,145 --> 01:13:18,710
But I baked a butter cake too.

1122
01:13:18,736 --> 01:13:20,771
And it'll be out of the oven
in two shakes.

1123
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:23,163
And you'll come
and join us when it's ready now?

1124
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:24,232
Right.

1125
01:13:30,049 --> 01:13:33,561
No English server would comport
themselves in that fashion.

1126
01:13:33,587 --> 01:13:35,138
But Mary isn't a servant.

1127
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:37,267
She is my friend and companion.

1128
01:13:37,268 --> 01:13:39,268
As dear to Ceddie as she is to me.

1129
01:13:39,908 --> 01:13:40,978
I see.

1130
01:13:42,554 --> 01:13:44,329
I like you, Mrs. Errol.

1131
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,680
Would you come and spend Christmas
with us at Lorradaile Castle?

1132
01:13:48,192 --> 01:13:49,569
That's very kind of you.

1133
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:52,126
I promised Ceddie
I would always be nearby.

1134
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,199
I understand.

1135
01:13:58,281 --> 01:14:00,443
My mother's sons Maurice
and Bevis were

1136
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,463
bitter disappointments to him.

1137
01:14:02,717 --> 01:14:04,643
Wastrels enriching.

1138
01:14:05,605 --> 01:14:08,786
Your Cedric, your husband,
whom he loved.

1139
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:12,493
Cedric disappointed him too.

1140
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:14,198
By marrying me.

1141
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:17,318
My brother would be not be
so prejudiced if he knew you.

1142
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,312
I doubt that will ever happen!

1143
01:14:23,224 --> 01:14:24,543
Oh.

1144
01:14:25,203 --> 01:14:27,446
Won't Ceddie look dear in this?

1145
01:14:28,404 --> 01:14:30,506
He won't be test wearing it.

1146
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:10,675
His mother's not attending.

1147
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:15,171
My grandson, Lord Fauntleroy.
Lady Grace.

1148
01:15:16,171 --> 01:15:18,759
You're beautiful enough
to be a princess.

1149
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,961
You make the most of your time,
Fauntleroy.

1150
01:15:20,986 --> 01:15:22,896
You'll not dare be so foolish
when you're older.

1151
01:15:22,897 --> 01:15:26,205
I think Lord Fauntleroy
will always say what he thinks.

1152
01:15:26,477 --> 01:15:28,260
So you think I'm beautiful?

1153
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,795
Beautifuler than anyone.

1154
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:32,792
Except my mama, of course.

1155
01:15:32,867 --> 01:15:35,895
No one should be more beautiful
to a boy than his mother.

1156
01:15:36,852 --> 01:15:39,461
Excuse us. Come, Cedric.

1157
01:15:39,487 --> 01:15:41,168
You must be introduced
to the other guests.

1158
01:15:42,676 --> 01:15:46,744
Freddy, my grandson. Lord Fauntleroy.

1159
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:48,770
Lord Ashbey Delefante.

1160
01:15:48,829 --> 01:15:50,262
I knew your father, my boy.

1161
01:15:50,288 --> 01:15:52,065
Great Huntsman.
Ride the hounds, my boy?

1162
01:15:52,066 --> 01:15:55,479
I only ride to a promontory.
And sometimes the village.

1163
01:15:55,505 --> 01:15:56,793
You are a love.

1164
01:15:57,069 --> 01:15:58,901
What's that in your pocket, Ceddie?

1165
01:15:58,935 --> 01:16:01,519
Oh. It's a gift from Dick the bootblack.

1166
01:16:01,594 --> 01:16:04,135
He said I was to wear it when
I'm with all the swells.

1167
01:16:04,176 --> 01:16:05,935
So I guess now is the right time.

1168
01:16:05,995 --> 01:16:08,836
Molyneux, how do you like
being called a swell?

1169
01:16:08,862 --> 01:16:10,222
I daresay have been called worse.

1170
01:16:10,297 --> 01:16:11,749
Especially by me.

1171
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,321
But you are a bit of a tyrant
when we were

1172
01:16:13,347 --> 01:16:15,397
both growing up
in this monstrous old house.

1173
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:18,334
Well, Ceddie.
Are you enjoying the party?

1174
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:21,288
Well. It's not very lively.

1175
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,479
I guess is because the music
is not very likely.

1176
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,699
Right. It's no more lively
than Westminster Abby.

1177
01:16:26,725 --> 01:16:28,465
Will you do something about it?

1178
01:16:28,515 --> 01:16:29,489
Constancia!

1179
01:16:29,515 --> 01:16:31,227
Fiddlesticks! Come, Ceddie.

1180
01:16:34,334 --> 01:16:36,423
Lord Fauntleroy has a request.

1181
01:16:36,449 --> 01:16:38,507
Tell them what you'd like them
to play, Ceddie.

1182
01:16:38,508 --> 01:16:41,409
Oh, Dem Golden Slippers.
It goes like this.

1183
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,546
They played at the Starlight Bar
on Hester Street.

1184
01:16:48,547 --> 01:16:50,648
Me and the boys used to
wait in the alley and

1185
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:52,574
watch the dancing girls
when the door opened.

1186
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:53,714
It was sure a sight!

1187
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:54,876
Sing it to them.

1188
01:16:54,909 --> 01:16:57,808
Then perhaps our esteemed musicians
can pick up the tune.

1189
01:16:58,051 --> 01:16:59,124
All right.

1190
01:16:59,141 --> 01:17:02,939
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!

1191
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:07,238
Golden slippers I'm gonna wear,
because dey look so neat.

1192
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:11,252
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!

1193
01:17:11,278 --> 01:17:14,911
Golden slippers I'm gonna wear,
To walk de golden street.

1194
01:17:40,024 --> 01:17:41,929
 Shall we?
 Why not!

1195
01:17:59,781 --> 01:18:01,797
 May I?
 You may.

1196
01:18:08,254 --> 01:18:12,471
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!

1197
01:18:15,915 --> 01:18:20,115
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!

1198
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:27,630
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!

1199
01:18:30,578 --> 01:18:34,841
Oh, dem golden slippers!
Oh, dem golden slippers!

1200
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,089
Oh, so, Molyneux!

1201
01:18:41,532 --> 01:18:45,732
The House of Dorincourt has finally
got an heir worthy of the title.

1202
01:18:50,035 --> 01:18:53,767
Something's troubling you, Molyneux?
What is it?

1203
01:18:54,556 --> 01:18:56,616
You'll hear it soon enough.

1204
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:15,608
Faster! Faster!
Dammit, this isn't a funeral.

1205
01:19:15,822 --> 01:19:17,507
It may well be.

1206
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,223
My Lord.

1207
01:19:30,496 --> 01:19:32,299
The worst possible news.

1208
01:19:34,339 --> 01:19:37,441
I've never known bad news
to improve with keeping.

1209
01:19:37,533 --> 01:19:39,777
Bevis did marry the woman
eight years ago.

1210
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:42,983
She has the marriage certificate.
And it has been verified.

1211
01:19:43,337 --> 01:19:45,054
Much as it pains me, my Lord.

1212
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,751
I believe her son is
the rightful heir to the title.

1213
01:19:50,948 --> 01:19:56,091
Bevis brought me nothing
but unhappiness in life.

1214
01:19:56,774 --> 01:19:58,976
And now in death as well.

1215
01:20:01,282 --> 01:20:03,272
There's no question about it?

1216
01:20:03,288 --> 01:20:05,169
Sir, the ceremony was performed
at White Chapel.

1217
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,770
And duly registered.

1218
01:20:09,064 --> 01:20:11,665
Why has the woman waited
till now to make her claim?

1219
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:14,550
She told me that only
recently she understood

1220
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:16,292
her son could lay claim to the title.

1221
01:20:21,912 --> 01:20:23,675
If anyone had told me

1222
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:27,943
that I could care for a
child as I care for Cedric,

1223
01:20:28,654 --> 01:20:30,436
I would not have believed it.

1224
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:35,153
I'm not well liked... here.

1225
01:20:35,848 --> 01:20:37,931
He finds me a great liking.

1226
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:43,896
He would've filled my place
better than I had.

1227
01:20:44,117 --> 01:20:46,819
He would've done honor to the name.

1228
01:20:50,704 --> 01:20:52,392
Bring the woman here.

1229
01:20:52,418 --> 01:20:54,620
And her spawn.

1230
01:20:55,795 --> 01:20:58,336
House them at the inn.

1231
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:01,577
And thank you.

1232
01:21:12,943 --> 01:21:15,385
Get along, boy. We ain't got all day.

1233
01:21:15,386 --> 01:21:17,165
We're gonna see your grandpa, the Earl.

1234
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:18,723
Commoner dirt!

1235
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,712
Serves his Lordship right.

1236
01:21:20,738 --> 01:21:23,940
Treating the captain's great lady
the way he did.

1237
01:21:24,006 --> 01:21:25,675
You should not pass judgment.

1238
01:21:26,425 --> 01:21:29,071
Perhaps the woman is
not what she appears.

1239
01:21:29,072 --> 01:21:32,888
You don't mind the free talk,
Rev. Muldaur?

1240
01:21:32,914 --> 01:21:35,240
I know a tart when I see one.

1241
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:39,003
Well, what's she like, Mrs. Dawson?

1242
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,773
Think the worst.
And you'll be half right.

1243
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,041
Let her come into the house.
And I'll go out of it.

1244
01:21:45,142 --> 01:21:48,524
Get me a cup of teano. A sherry.
I feel faint.

1245
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:49,862
How is his Lordship taking it?

1246
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,581
As well as can be expected.

1247
01:21:51,582 --> 01:21:53,937
What will happen
to little Lord Fauntleroy now?

1248
01:21:53,963 --> 01:21:55,889
He'll not be Earl of Dorincourt.
That's what.

1249
01:21:57,476 --> 01:22:00,489
I never thought I'd say it but
my heart goes out to the Earl.

1250
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,618
I've never seen a man so shattered.

1251
01:22:03,778 --> 01:22:06,397
Does it mean I have to go
away from you, grandpa?

1252
01:22:06,423 --> 01:22:08,004
That will never happen.

1253
01:22:08,753 --> 01:22:10,907
Will I still be your boy like before?

1254
01:22:10,933 --> 01:22:13,144
You will always be my boy.

1255
01:22:14,855 --> 01:22:16,732
Well, I don't care about the Earl part.

1256
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:18,499
I was just afraid

1257
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,926
if I couldn't be the Earl
and I couldn't be your boy

1258
01:22:31,217 --> 01:22:33,822
Who would come visiting
on a raw day like this?

1259
01:22:39,068 --> 01:22:42,869
It's his honor. His Lordship, I mean.

1260
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,371
Kindly come in, your Lordship.

1261
01:22:52,873 --> 01:22:54,722
The chair near the fire is comfortable.

1262
01:22:54,748 --> 01:22:57,299
Thank you. I prefer to stand.

1263
01:22:57,374 --> 01:22:59,258
I shall only stay a moment.

1264
01:22:59,718 --> 01:23:01,908
You know why I've come here.

1265
01:23:01,934 --> 01:23:04,462
Mr. Havisham has informed me
of the new claim to the title.

1266
01:23:04,489 --> 01:23:06,860
That claim will be contested.

1267
01:23:06,919 --> 01:23:08,600
If a contest can be made.

1268
01:23:08,626 --> 01:23:10,946
Ceddie will have nothing
that is not his own.

1269
01:23:11,011 --> 01:23:14,746
The idea that a child
of that outrageous woman should

1270
01:23:14,772 --> 01:23:17,436
I'm certain that his mother
cares for him as I care for Ceddie.

1271
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,920
And if she was your eldest son's wife,

1272
01:23:19,921 --> 01:23:22,507
her son is Lord Fauntleroy.
And mine is not.

1273
01:23:22,508 --> 01:23:26,084
Perhaps you prefer your son
not to become the Earl of Dorincourt.

1274
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:28,715
There was a time
when I would've been so inclined.

1275
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:32,860
But there is such suffering.
Such poverty.

1276
01:23:33,743 --> 01:23:37,154
I know Ceddie would've used his position
to improve the lot of others.

1277
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,484
That he would've been
decent and caring.

1278
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:41,371
Unlike his grandfather?

1279
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:45,129
I've not had the pleasure
of knowing his grandfather.

1280
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,480
But I know Ceddie loves you.

1281
01:23:47,572 --> 01:23:49,590
Would he love me I wonder

1282
01:23:50,573 --> 01:23:54,156
if you had told him, I would
never receive you at the castle?

1283
01:23:55,075 --> 01:23:56,676
I think not.

1284
01:23:57,965 --> 01:24:00,132
Few women would've remained silent.

1285
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:04,286
I'm an old man. And was tired of life.

1286
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:06,841
Your son gave me something to live for.

1287
01:24:07,068 --> 01:24:11,569
It pleased me to think
that someday he would take my place.

1288
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:15,395
It seems that's not to be.

1289
01:24:17,661 --> 01:24:19,338
I came to tell you

1290
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:24,744
that Cedric will be wellprovided for,
both now and in the future.

1291
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:26,141
It is your privilege.

1292
01:24:26,698 --> 01:24:29,125
And you may see Ceddie
whenever you wish.

1293
01:24:29,126 --> 01:24:31,050
I will not deny you his company.

1294
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:33,220
Nor deny him yours.

1295
01:24:33,247 --> 01:24:35,947
Thank you. Good afternoon.

1296
01:24:45,871 --> 01:24:49,639
Well. Like it's been said,
pride goeth before a fall.

1297
01:24:49,963 --> 01:24:51,707
I'm sorry for him, Mary.

1298
01:24:52,261 --> 01:24:54,670
This is a bitter moment for him.

1299
01:24:55,884 --> 01:24:57,141
Dick!

1300
01:24:58,846 --> 01:24:59,881
Dick!

1301
01:24:59,882 --> 01:25:02,040
 I got a letter from Ceddie.
 That's good news.

1302
01:25:02,066 --> 01:25:04,067
You won't think so when
you hear it what it says.

1303
01:25:04,311 --> 01:25:05,588
"Dear Mr. Hobbs and Dick,

1304
01:25:05,614 --> 01:25:08,737
"I got something curious to tell you.
And I know you will be surprised.

1305
01:25:08,821 --> 01:25:10,336
"It's all a mistake.

1306
01:25:10,369 --> 01:25:13,498
"And I am not a Lord.
And will not be an Earl.

1307
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:17,202
"A lady married to my uncle Bevis
has a a little boy.

1308
01:25:17,203 --> 01:25:19,204
"And he comes first.

1309
01:25:21,121 --> 01:25:22,294
"I don't mind it all,

1310
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,582
"Seeing as I can live
with mama and Mary now,

1311
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,601
"and go see my grandpa every day,

1312
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:27,534
"which is everything turned around.

1313
01:25:27,535 --> 01:25:28,659
 "Isn't it?"
 It sure is.

1314
01:25:28,685 --> 01:25:31,287
We are going to stay here because
mama knows that I love my grandpa.

1315
01:25:31,313 --> 01:25:32,728
"And that he loves me.

1316
01:25:32,729 --> 01:25:35,309
"But I'm not gonna be rich
or be an Earl.

1317
01:25:35,335 --> 01:25:36,555
"So there you are."

1318
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:37,887
I'll be blowed.

1319
01:25:37,913 --> 01:25:39,016
Now wait. There's more.

1320
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:41,849
"My grandpa is in a terrible state
because you don't like the lady.

1321
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:43,370
"but he'll get over it, I'm sure."

1322
01:25:43,396 --> 01:25:45,169
Yeah I'm sure..Uhhuh. Yeah.

1323
01:25:45,218 --> 01:25:47,747
"I will write another letter
soon to tell you more.

1324
01:25:47,773 --> 01:25:50,033
"I hope business is booming.
Love from your old friend,

1325
01:25:50,082 --> 01:25:54,194
"Ceddie.
PS, not Lord Fauntleroy anymore."

1326
01:25:54,424 --> 01:25:56,804
You know what? Ceddie's been done in.

1327
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:59,624
Done in proper. In my opinion,
it's a put up job.

1328
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:02,980
That English aristocrat's robbing Ceddie
of his rights because he's an American.

1329
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:04,856
They had a fight against us
ever since the Revolution.

1330
01:26:04,882 --> 01:26:06,743
And they're taking it out on Ceddie.

1331
01:26:07,519 --> 01:26:10,357
Look it was in this morning's paper,
including a picture.

1332
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:13,881
Hmm. That's Minna!

1333
01:26:13,907 --> 01:26:15,448
Yeah, Minna. Minna Errol.

1334
01:26:15,474 --> 01:26:18,180
That's what it says.
"Daughterinlaw of English Earl."

1335
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,680
Daughterinlaw, my foot!

1336
01:26:19,706 --> 01:26:21,308
That's Minna Tipton! That's who that is.

1337
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,329
What's the matter with you?

1338
01:26:22,362 --> 01:26:24,436
She married my brother Ben!

1339
01:26:24,632 --> 01:26:28,351
Yeah, left him flat to go to London
nine, 10 years ago.

1340
01:26:28,377 --> 01:26:29,843
With some tinsley show.

1341
01:26:29,844 --> 01:26:31,727
And that boy.
He's the spitting image of Ben.

1342
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:34,336
I even know where she had him too.
In Bellevue Hospital!

1343
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:39,609
Well, I'll be jiggered.

1344
01:26:40,223 --> 01:26:41,545
There's no question in your mind?

1345
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:43,989
No, sir. That's Minna all right.

1346
01:26:44,056 --> 01:26:47,263
 Where is your brother Ben now?
 Kansas City.

1347
01:26:47,496 --> 01:26:49,306
Had a postal card from him
just the other day.

1348
01:26:49,332 --> 01:26:51,171
He's running some
rinkydink show down there.

1349
01:26:51,195 --> 01:26:52,557
Pack up your brushes and polishes!

1350
01:26:52,558 --> 01:26:54,429
I'll pay the damages. Whatever!

1351
01:26:54,504 --> 01:26:56,505
We're gonna get ourselves a lawyer.

1352
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:03,878
Faster, man! Faster!

1353
01:27:03,904 --> 01:27:06,803
This isn't a funeral!
It's a celebration!

1354
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:12,068
A fraud! I knew it!

1355
01:27:12,094 --> 01:27:14,527
But what of her marriage to Bevis?

1356
01:27:14,602 --> 01:27:16,789
Illegal since the woman
was already married.

1357
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:20,229
It seems Bevis and the lady tired
of each other quickly and parted.

1358
01:27:20,304 --> 01:27:23,405
What is your plan, Havisham?
How do we proceed?

1359
01:27:23,505 --> 01:27:25,671
I knew your Lordship
would have no objection

1360
01:27:25,672 --> 01:27:27,375
to my moving quickly on this matter,

1361
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:29,452
so I cabled monies
to the lawyer in New York.

1362
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:32,716
To pay passage for the woman's husband
and his brother Dick.

1363
01:27:32,843 --> 01:27:34,150
– The bootblack?
– The same.

1364
01:27:34,176 --> 01:27:35,740
And since Dick wouldn't come
without Mr. Hobbs

1365
01:27:35,766 --> 01:27:37,895
 the grocer?
 Precisely.

1366
01:27:37,945 --> 01:27:40,107
Their ship docks in Liverpool
the day before Christmas.

1367
01:27:40,113 --> 01:27:42,267
I've already arranged
for swift transportation to Dorincourt.

1368
01:27:42,293 --> 01:27:43,643
Good.

1369
01:27:45,979 --> 01:27:48,001
The woman is still at the inn?

1370
01:27:48,027 --> 01:27:50,305
Yes, my Lord. Biding her time.

1371
01:27:50,355 --> 01:27:52,809
She's to be told nothing…yet.

1372
01:27:52,835 --> 01:27:54,782
Nor is anyone to be told.

1373
01:27:54,882 --> 01:27:57,783
Lord Fauntleroy, not even to know
that his friends are coming?

1374
01:27:57,883 --> 01:27:59,935
Let it be a surprise to him.

1375
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:01,885
Well done, Havisham.

1376
01:28:02,045 --> 01:28:03,659
Well done, indeed.

1377
01:28:03,777 --> 01:28:08,733
O come, all ye faithful,

1378
01:28:09,277 --> 01:28:12,803
Joyful and triumphant!

1379
01:28:13,112 --> 01:28:21,745
O come ye,
O come ye to Bethlehem.

1380
01:28:22,529 --> 01:28:26,662
Come and behold him.

1381
01:28:27,216 --> 01:28:30,934
Born the King of Angels.

1382
01:28:31,113 --> 01:28:35,717
O come, let us adore Him.

1383
01:28:36,087 --> 01:28:40,288
O come, let us adore Him.

1384
01:28:41,043 --> 01:28:43,049
Well, I'll be jiggered!

1385
01:28:45,485 --> 01:28:50,138
Christ the Lord.

1386
01:29:00,405 --> 01:29:03,231
You live good if you're an aristocrat,
sir.

1387
01:29:03,431 --> 01:29:05,943
I wouldn't mind having
my shoe shining concession here.

1388
01:29:06,172 --> 01:29:08,304
You could put on a proper circus.

1389
01:29:08,305 --> 01:29:11,265
Clowns. Elephants. The big top.

1390
01:29:13,095 --> 01:29:15,749
The lady has arrived, your Lordship.

1391
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,934
She still suspects nothing, I hope.

1392
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,497
Nothing, my Lord.
She believes she's to take up residence.

1393
01:29:21,581 --> 01:29:23,100
Show the lady in, Dawson.

1394
01:29:25,202 --> 01:29:26,629
Mr. Tipton.

1395
01:29:26,663 --> 01:29:30,037
Would you be good enough
to stand at my side?

1396
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:41,419
Minna! I see you've been
up to your old tricks.

1397
01:29:41,445 --> 01:29:43,592
This lady is your wife, Mr. Tipton?

1398
01:29:43,593 --> 01:29:45,773
Tied the knot nine years ago
this January.

1399
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:47,635
And fathered a little feller
one year later.

1400
01:29:47,695 --> 01:29:48,808
Liar!

1401
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:51,620
I never saw your ugly face before!

1402
01:29:51,621 --> 01:29:53,176
It's my Minna, all right.

1403
01:29:53,202 --> 01:29:55,617
Shrew and fishwife from the word Go.

1404
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:59,989
Who you gonna believe?
Them shady characters or me?

1405
01:30:00,233 --> 01:30:03,934
Who's practically your own
flesh and blood, once removed.

1406
01:30:04,026 --> 01:30:06,173
My boy is you write in proper heir.

1407
01:30:06,199 --> 01:30:07,953
And I want what's coming to me.

1408
01:30:08,042 --> 01:30:10,187
What's coming to you is
the back of my hand.

1409
01:30:10,213 --> 01:30:12,257
You gonna let him
talk to me like that?

1410
01:30:12,283 --> 01:30:15,984
Me, who's the mother
of your lovely little grand son?

1411
01:30:16,058 --> 01:30:18,142
Save your breath, Minna. The jig's up.
And you know what!

1412
01:30:18,143 --> 01:30:20,478
Shut up, you worm!

1413
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:23,759
Some father you are,
depriving your own son!

1414
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:29,690
You dirty doubledealing spoiler!

1415
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:33,255
You lost your looks.
But not your sweet disposition!

1416
01:30:33,256 --> 01:30:35,919
It's hello and goodbye, Minna.

1417
01:30:35,945 --> 01:30:37,683
Well, I ain't leaving.

1418
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:39,882
I deserve something.

1419
01:30:39,908 --> 01:30:42,492
For the tender care I gave
your drunkard son.

1420
01:30:43,527 --> 01:30:46,852
Is Mrs. Tipton entitled
to compensation, Havisham?

1421
01:30:46,878 --> 01:30:48,425
Hardly, my Lord.

1422
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:50,923
I suggest we send for the Constable.

1423
01:30:50,949 --> 01:30:54,517
British jurisprudence deals severely
with frauds and pretenders.

1424
01:30:54,518 --> 01:30:56,997
You know the way out, madam.

1425
01:30:57,023 --> 01:30:59,645
I suggest you take it.

1426
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,878
I should've done you in
instead of leaving you.

1427
01:31:07,123 --> 01:31:09,614
I am forever in your debt, Mr. Tipton.

1428
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:11,638
It's been a pleasure, Your Highness.

1429
01:31:12,725 --> 01:31:16,887
Dawson, kindly send for Lord Fauntleroy.

1430
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,873
Already have, my Lord.

1431
01:31:18,899 --> 01:31:20,079
They're here?

1432
01:31:20,571 --> 01:31:22,746
Mr. Hobbs, Dick?

1433
01:31:34,576 --> 01:31:37,658
Never been so jiggered
when Dawson said you were here.

1434
01:31:37,839 --> 01:31:39,621
Not half so jiggered as us.

1435
01:31:39,647 --> 01:31:42,525
Up in this here castle
with an ocean voyage to boot.

1436
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,117
Boy, you sure do look elegant
in them clothes, Ceddie.

1437
01:31:45,143 --> 01:31:48,137
I have to wear them. It goes
with the job of being a Lord.

1438
01:31:48,749 --> 01:31:50,840
Well, they're becoming, Ceddie.

1439
01:31:50,866 --> 01:31:53,939
Mind you, I ain't one to admire
the trappings of aristocrats.

1440
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,957
Hey, could we see the dungeon, Ceddie?

1441
01:31:55,983 --> 01:31:57,753
I ain't never seen one before.

1442
01:31:57,755 --> 01:31:59,755
And I sure would like to
before we have to go back.

1443
01:31:59,756 --> 01:32:02,443
But Dawson said you won't
leave before a fortnight.

1444
01:32:03,402 --> 01:32:06,206
 What's a fortnight?
 Two whole weeks.

1445
01:32:07,627 --> 01:32:09,598
I hope your business doesn't suffer.

1446
01:32:09,838 --> 01:32:11,369
Or yours, Mr. Hobbs.

1447
01:32:11,395 --> 01:32:13,975
I wouldn't have missed this trip
and its consequences.

1448
01:32:14,001 --> 01:32:15,194
For all the tea in China, Ceddie.

1449
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:15,978
Me neither.

1450
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:17,846
Well, then will have a fine time.

1451
01:32:17,897 --> 01:32:20,370
There will be
a great Christmas party tomorrow.

1452
01:32:20,397 --> 01:32:21,760
And you and Mr. Hobbs
are the guests of honor.

1453
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:24,077
Grandpa said for you to stay
in the house of Dorincourt.

1454
01:32:24,078 --> 01:32:25,380
Whatever that means.

1455
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:28,004
There will be music and dancing.
And heaps to eat.

1456
01:32:35,773 --> 01:32:38,441
I just wish Mama and Mary
could come too.

1457
01:32:41,601 --> 01:32:44,523
Will have a separate Christmas party
with Mama and Mary!

1458
01:32:44,549 --> 01:32:47,227
We sure will.
Okay!

1459
01:32:47,302 --> 01:32:48,710
It's snowing!

1460
01:33:05,609 --> 01:33:08,227
I wonder if Mama is
watching the snow coming down too?

1461
01:33:23,657 --> 01:33:25,958
Wake up, your Lordship. Wake up!

1462
01:33:26,504 --> 01:33:28,133
Mr. Hobbs and Dick up yet?

1463
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:30,216
Up and about.
They had breakfast hours ago.

1464
01:33:30,242 --> 01:33:32,321
And they was wanting to see the stables.

1465
01:33:32,322 --> 01:33:34,906
Hours ago?
Why didn't you wake me up?

1466
01:33:34,932 --> 01:33:36,848
His Lordship said
I was to let you sleep in.

1467
01:33:36,923 --> 01:33:38,444
Seeing as how
there is a big day ahead.

1468
01:33:38,451 --> 01:33:40,055
But we best step lively now.

1469
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:42,075
His Lordship wants you
in the Great Hall.

1470
01:33:42,125 --> 01:33:45,026
I guess grandpa wants me
to see my Christmas presents.

1471
01:33:45,302 --> 01:33:48,061
What do you think of Dick?
He thinks you're smashing.

1472
01:33:48,087 --> 01:33:49,737
He's a cashew nut, Dick.

1473
01:33:49,788 --> 01:33:51,003
Here you are, your Lordship.

1474
01:33:51,045 --> 01:33:53,464
And you're to go straight
to the Great Hall. Don't forget.

1475
01:33:53,705 --> 01:33:55,465
I'm coming, grandpa!

1476
01:34:02,975 --> 01:34:05,091
I'll be jiggered!

1477
01:34:05,293 --> 01:34:07,561
Now that IS a Christmas tree!

1478
01:34:15,074 --> 01:34:16,199
Mama!

1479
01:35:38,446 --> 01:35:40,588
Custom has decreed,

1480
01:35:40,614 --> 01:35:42,332
that each Christmas,

1481
01:35:42,358 --> 01:35:45,637
a celebration should be held
in the servant's hall

1482
01:35:45,638 --> 01:35:47,371
for all at the castle.

1483
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:53,226
This year the celebration is being
held here in the Great Hall.

1484
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:56,743
By my grandson's degree.

1485
01:36:03,046 --> 01:36:07,803
This is a most joyous Christmas
I've ever known.

1486
01:36:08,878 --> 01:36:12,089
I ask you to drink to the
health and happiness...

1487
01:36:12,879 --> 01:36:15,390
of the future Earl of Dorincourt:

1488
01:36:16,015 --> 01:36:17,717
Lord Fauntleroy.

1489
01:36:21,781 --> 01:36:24,299
For Lord Fauntleroy!

1490
01:36:34,195 --> 01:36:36,169
You must respond.

1491
01:36:43,292 --> 01:36:45,644
This is the best Christmas I ever had.

1492
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:48,637
And I don't mind one bit
being Lord Fauntleroy.

1493
01:36:48,638 --> 01:36:50,764
And the future Earl of Dorincourt.

1494
01:36:51,179 --> 01:36:53,154
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1495
01:36:53,229 --> 01:36:54,997
And to all the people everywhere!

1496
01:36:55,023 --> 01:36:56,854
Merry Christmas!

1497
01:36:57,397 --> 01:36:59,598
Merry Christmas!

1498
01:37:06,303 --> 01:37:08,141
Did I do all right?

1499
01:37:09,305 --> 01:37:15,932
