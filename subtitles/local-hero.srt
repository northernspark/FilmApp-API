Mr Happer. Mr Happer, sir.

28
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,958
Today's main business

29
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:35,963
is the progress of our
acquisition of part of Scotland

30
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,382
for the refinery and storage base.

31
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:41,219
I've got a few things to show you.

32
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:45,347
We have a two-year lead
in North Atlantic development.

33
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:50,353
We can double this by streamlining
the processing end of things onshore.

34
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:54,358
The pipeline is well on its way
from all three production areas.

35
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:59,864
- We have a site for the terminal.
- What about the site acquisition?

36
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,826
The survey teams found
the only suitable bay on the coast.

37
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,747
Total investment is 600 million,
over three fiscals.

38
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,418
We've got to buy Ferness Bay
for $60 million.

39
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,462
We're dealing with stable allies
of the US,

40
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:19,260
not to mention the links historically
between Knox Oil and Scotland.

41
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:21,845
We're not in a third world situation.

42
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:25,683
I think we should get
a negotiator on the site.

43
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,519
Do I really have to go there?

44
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:32,816
I could fix the deals over the phone,
like with Salinas last year?

45
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:36,487
It's not like Mexico, Macintyre,
it's people like us.

46
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,532
You're a Scot. You'll be dealing
with your own people.

47
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:44,286
You won't be dealing
with a bunch of Indians.

48
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,958
Cal, will you look after
Africa while I'm gone?

49
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,960
Just the west coast deals.
Sarah's got the files.

50
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:55,424
We've got the Congo development
minister's tit in the wringer

51
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,926
so I think we can close this deal.

52
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,262
'What about the tanker franchise?'

53
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:02,932
I want franchises in all territories.

54
00:04:03,015 --> 00:04:05,935
And put a five-day deadline
on the offer.

55
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,896
- 'You got it.'
- You want to eat?

56
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:14,319
Cal, I've got a confession to make.
I'm not Scottish.

57
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:17,948
Man, oh, man!
Think I should tell Fountain?

58
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:22,327
Hell, no. Don't spoil the fun.
Take the trip.

59
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:26,582
My folks changed their name
when they arrived from Hungary.

60
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,336
They thought Macintyre was American.

61
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,423
Jesus, Mac, you're not a Scotchman,
you're not a Texan.

62
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,010
I can't even pronounce my last name.

63
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:40,514
Comets are important. They could be
the key to the universe.

64
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:43,559
What will you call this comet,
Happer?

65
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:49,107
The Happer Comet
or Happer's Comet...or Comet Happer.

66
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,775
I thought it might be!

67
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:55,364
The whole world will weep with
gratitude when the big day comes.

68
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:58,283
Mr Happer's got his comet. Hooray!

69
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:01,370
What an empty, hollow,
wasteful activity.

70
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:05,750
You're chasing comets around the sky.
Is your life so complete?

71
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:09,337
What about a wife?
Children? A family?

72
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,049
Are these human goals
too simple for you?

73
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:15,760
Get out, Moritz! That's enough.

74
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,347
I've got some meetings.
Out! Out! Out!

75
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,645
Yes, sir. Uh, it seemed to go pretty
well today, didn't it, sir?

76
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:25,771
It was OK, Moritz.

77
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:28,315
I think we could
build up the sessions...

78
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,653
at the same fee, of course.

79
00:05:31,736 --> 00:05:33,738
We're at a crucial stage.

80
00:05:33,822 --> 00:05:37,117
Speak to Mrs Wyatt.
Fix a half-hour for Friday.

81
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:40,537
I could give you
an abusive phone call some night.

82
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,335
Anytime that's inconvenient. Surprise
might do some good. I mean harm.

83
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:48,254
Out!

84
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,133
Moritz!

85
00:05:56,388 --> 00:06:00,142
Did you mean that stuff
about me being a flop?

86
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:04,355
Oh, God, no, Mr Happer!
It's basic therapy technique.

87
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:08,151
Sometimes I get carried away.

88
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,822
You think if I'd married,
things would be different?

89
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,990
Oh, by no means, Mr Happer.

90
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:19,747
The world offers many alternatives
to the security of the family unit.

91
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,166
Look at me, Mr Happer.

92
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,502
I'm a single man.

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,755
Get out.

94
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:34,345
Mrs Wyatt, who are we sending
to Scotland on that refinery deal?

95
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,850
'Mr Crabbe selected
Mr Macintyre of Acquisitions.

96
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:41,019
'His Scottish connections
fit the bill,

97
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:43,981
'and he handled Mexico
well last year.'

98
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:46,734
I want to see him before he leaves.

99
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:51,739
Cal, I've just been called upstairs.
I'm going to meet the man.

100
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:54,326
This could be it. Big doings!

101
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,038
And I get to ride
the express elevator, too.

102
00:06:58,121 --> 00:07:01,834
I have the Prime Minister for you,
Mr Happer. Hold on.

103
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,839
Mr Happer, ma'am.

104
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:09,717
Yes, I did!
I tried it with the raspberries.

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,306
It was delicious,
although I only had frozen.

106
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,307
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:19,770
Here's Mr Happer now. Goodbye.

108
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:27,361
I'm sorry, Your Excellency,
but Mr Happer can't talk right now.

109
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:31,157
Ask His Serene Highness
to call back in half an hour.

110
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,487
Macintyre, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

111
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:12,702
- Going to Scotland, Macintyre?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:17,207
Be like going home,
like we're going home, eh?

113
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,128
The founder of all this was a Scot...
Alexander Knox.

114
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:27,301
That's not him. That's my father.
He bought out Knox in 1912.

115
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:33,308
Would've been handy if he'd thought
to change the company name then.

116
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:39,272
Anyway, you're going to Scotland.
The old country, hey, Macintyre?

117
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:41,233
Yes, sir!

118
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:44,528
Virgo is well up this time of year.

119
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:48,908
Sir?

120
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:52,995
I'm talking about the sky, Macintyre.

121
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,290
The constellation of Virgo

122
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:58,668
is very prominent
in the sky now, in Scotland.

123
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:02,423
I want you
to keep an eye on Virgo for me.

124
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:04,258
Will you do that?

125
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:06,261
Oh, sure.

126
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:38,128
This is Virgo. Find the Great Bear,
the Big Dipper, and you can't miss.

127
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:43,217
I'm expecting something special
from there. I want reports.

128
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:47,388
- Reports, sir?
- Anything unusual in Virgo.

129
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:51,642
It might be a new star
or even a shooting star.

130
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,269
I want reports.

131
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:57,274
Anything out of the ordinary,
you telephone me, night or day.

132
00:09:57,357 --> 00:09:59,526
This is my private number.

133
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:04,239
You'll be travelling
six hours east...you'll be ahead.

134
00:10:04,323 --> 00:10:05,950
Think of that.

135
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:09,704
Do you know what I'm talking about?

136
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:14,668
- I have a general...
- You'll know when you see it.

137
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:17,295
And you'll telephone me, OK?

138
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,258
You do know what a comet is,
don't you?

139
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:24,637
- I would if I saw one.
- And you'd phone me?

140
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,600
- Yes, sir.
- Good man. You got the picture.

141
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:33,229
The northern sky
is a beautiful thing, Macintosh.

142
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:37,234
You're going to have
a wonderful trip.

143
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:38,694
Thank you, sir.

144
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,372
Yes?

145
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:51,374
'Hi, Rita.'

146
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:54,753
- Who is this?
- 'Mac!'

147
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:56,338
Yes?

148
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:59,341
'I'm leaving the country for a while.

149
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:04,346
'I was wondering if you'd like to
celebrate this evening with a drink?'

150
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,766
Uh...no.

151
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:08,768
No, it's not. It's Mac.

152
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,353
She knows.

153
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,397
No. Mac. M-a-c.

154
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,734
Hello there!

155
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,737
How are you?

156
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:21,740
Oh, good. Yeah, I'm terrific, too.

157
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:23,742
No, I won't keep you.

158
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:28,414
I'm leaving town for a while,
and you still have stuff here.

159
00:11:28,497 --> 00:11:32,335
Some mail...three letters.
They've been here a while.

160
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:37,341
Your English cigarette lighter...?
I thought you might miss that.

161
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:40,635
It's not important
if you can live without it.

162
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:44,390
There is something else.
Remember my camera case?

163
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:48,728
The one you kept your make-up in?
I want it back.

164
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:51,356
No, that's not why I called...

165
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,316
No, that's not true!

166
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,319
Trudi, I don't want
to argue with you.

167
00:11:56,403 --> 00:11:59,322
Look, I'm not calling you a thief.

168
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:01,742
Maybe you are a kleptomaniac.

169
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,745
You think you ought
to see a doctor?

170
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,748
You're the pervert!

171
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:09,083
Just piss up a rope, all right?

172
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:15,757
'Our speed over the ocean
is 7 40 miles per hour.

173
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,761
'If you'd like
to adjust your watches,

174
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:21,096
'the time in Britain is 11:47

175
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,934
'and our estimated arrival
is at 1:45 local time.

176
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:27,061
'Shortly before our descent,

177
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:31,483
'I'll give you more information
on the weather in Britain.'

178
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,948
'British Caledonian. Would
passengers arrived from London

179
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:41,368
'and connecting with
Thistle and Ninian fields

180
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:46,415
'please proceed now to the helicopter
check-in desk at gate four.'

181
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:03,350
I'm Macintyre,
Knox Oil and Gas, Houston. Are you...

182
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,979
Oldsen, Knox Oil and Gas, Aberdeen.

183
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:10,149
I didn't want to make a fuss.
I know how delicate this is.

184
00:13:10,274 --> 00:13:13,320
You have a car to take me
to the laboratory?

185
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:14,696
Yes.

186
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,325
- Well, let's go.
- Can I give you a wee hand?

187
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:23,622
'Flight BA 40726 to Orkney
is now available for check-in.'

188
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:28,419
Could you close that door?
This is a controlled environment.

189
00:13:30,297 --> 00:13:35,218
- Um, Dr Geddes, Mr Watt, this is...
- Macintyre. Houston.

190
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:40,223
Welcome to our little world.
You've come to see the bay, eh?

191
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:43,644
Marina, this is Mr Macintyre
and Mr, eh...

192
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:45,646
Oldsen, Danny. Hello.

193
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:51,736
The sensor on 421's gone haywire.
I better replace it.

194
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:18,682
- She's got magnificent lungs.
- Oh, yes. A great asset.

195
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:22,477
Five oceanography degrees
and a talented programmer.

196
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,816
I'll get rid of her.
She's not in on this Ferness thing.

197
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,777
Actually, she's better in the field.

198
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:46,253
Here's the dud.

199
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:49,215
Um, you can take
some lunch now, Marina.

200
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,925
Sure.

201
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:06,651
I'll show you the site models,
shall I?

202
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:09,654
You'll see what you're
in the market for.

203
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:12,616
This is a bay in a million.

204
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:16,411
The silt's deep enough
to take the foundation piles.

205
00:15:16,494 --> 00:15:21,291
This harbour here is a natural for
blasting in the underground tanks.

206
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:26,255
Here. Hold Ferness
a minute, would you?

207
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,428
Plus, the debris rock will be used
to fill in the other beach

208
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:33,263
for the refinery.

209
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,640
With 12 more miles of coastline,

210
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:40,604
this could become the petro-chemical
capital of the free world.

211
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,607
Six months' blasting,
two years' construction.

212
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,235
It'll last 1,000 years. Forever!

213
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:51,240
It'll even survive the next ice age.
We've proved that, you know.

214
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:56,580
We've simulated 10,000 years
of glaciation over the whole bay.

215
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:58,707
We don't need that ice age.

216
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,045
We can divert the Gulf Stream
and unfreeze the Arctic Circle.

217
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:08,551
He proved it, but they won't listen.
They want to freeze.

218
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,389
Thank you, Norman,
there was no need to bring that up.

219
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:17,727
- Will, um, Marina be back?
- No, not for a while yet.

220
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,565
We should head north soon.

221
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,612
We'll see you
when we get back, maybe.

222
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,656
No. Take it. Keep it.

223
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:32,243
Dream large. Dream large!

224
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:45,090
- What you thinking about?
- Girls.

225
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:48,636
Naked girls.

226
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,054
Me, too.

227
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,765
- In a fish tank.
- Yeah.

228
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,628
- What's up?
- I think we hit something.

229
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:23,173
It got misty all of a sudden
and I think we hit something.

230
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,231
Shit! I hate hitting things!

231
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:41,234
- It's just kind of stunned.
- Maybe a broken leg.

232
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:44,238
- Should we put it out of its misery?
- What?

233
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:46,240
Hit it with something hard?

234
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:48,576
You did that with an automobile.

235
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,703
Put it in the car.

236
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,712
Well, we can't drive in this stuff.

237
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,966
Where are we?

238
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:06,929
The last road sign was in Gaelic.
It's not one of my languages.

239
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:09,974
You speak languages?

240
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,976
French, Italian, Spanish.

241
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,854
Greek, Turkish, Russian, Swedish,

242
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:17,815
German, Japanese, Dutch, and Polish.

243
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:20,861
I have a facility with languages.

244
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:27,410
I've got some chocolate and some gum.

245
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:30,830
- What have you got?
- Nothing.

246
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:32,332
Niente.

247
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,959
- Nada, rien...
- OK, OK.

248
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:44,803
This is my car.

249
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,680
Porsche 930.

250
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:48,808
Turbo-charged.

251
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:50,643
A car's important.

252
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:54,063
I got migraine headaches
driving a Chevy.

253
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:56,816
A car like this won't let you down.

254
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,867
Conference time in Houston.

255
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:08,454
I'll give them a call tomorrow.

256
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,960
Good night.

257
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,255
Yeah.

258
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:20,801
Could we
have the lights off?

259
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:22,844
Sure, sure.

260
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,376
- Morning.
- Hello.

261
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,411
- Some place, huh?
- Yeah.

262
00:20:27,081 --> 00:20:28,999
I think I'll call him Harry.

263
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,461
No. Her name's Trudi.

264
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:36,007
I'm hungry.

265
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,968
I'll drive.

266
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,095
Whole lot of scenery, though.

267
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:43,080
What is it?

268
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:49,921
Sorry to trouble you so early.

269
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,340
We'd like to check in
and maybe eat something.

270
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:56,344
Breakfast isn't till eight.
Seven in the fishing season.

271
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:58,555
It's not the fishing season.

272
00:21:58,638 --> 00:22:02,101
Could we check in?
We've been on the road all night.

273
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:04,645
We have an injured rabbit also.

274
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,871
It's never locked.

275
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,338
Passing through?

276
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:31,758
We might stay a few days.

277
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:42,895
Make yourself some toast and coffee.
We'll take care of formalities later.

278
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:47,357
I have to go back upstairs.
There's lettuce for the rabbit.

279
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:00,956
Nice people, huh?

280
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,375
Yeah, and they speak English.

281
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:08,339
Do you think
they're at it up there?

282
00:23:08,422 --> 00:23:10,341
No.

283
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:14,512
"We have an injured rabbit."

284
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:18,726
Think it's them?

285
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:20,769
Sure. 100% sure.

286
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:24,732
Christmas might be early this year.

287
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:27,193
What do you want for Christmas?

288
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:29,361
Better get that new mattress.

289
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:42,167
Hang on!

290
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,714
Yeah?

291
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,011
Would you have an adapter?
I have to charge my briefcase.

292
00:23:52,094 --> 00:23:55,515
The lock is electric.
Would you have an adapter?

293
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,143
Er, do you need it right away?

294
00:23:58,226 --> 00:23:59,310
Whenever.

295
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:02,815
Leave it with me
and I'll sort something out.

296
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:05,567
- I'll hold on to it.
- OK, fine.

297
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:06,819
Thanks.

298
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,293
- Everything OK, gents?
- Very nice.

299
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,296
We only do hot lunch every other day.

300
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:29,301
We have to talk to Mr "Urk-u-hart,"
an accountant.

301
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:35,266
He has an office right next door.
He'll be there in about 15 minutes.

302
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,269
Thank you.

303
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,271
Delicious.

304
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:40,522
Delicious.

305
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:07,802
Come in!

306
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:12,681
Hello again. I'm Gordon Urquhart.

307
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:15,268
We tend to double up on jobs here.

308
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:18,312
I'm a taxi driver, too. Sit down.

309
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:24,152
What can I do for you?

310
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:27,656
I represent
Knox Oil and Gas, Mr "Og-hart".

311
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,200
- Gordon.
- Gordon.

312
00:25:30,284 --> 00:25:34,747
I believe my people
let you know we'd be calling.

313
00:25:34,831 --> 00:25:37,918
That's right. So...what's up?

314
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:41,755
We're in the way of acquiring
some real estate.

315
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:45,968
We wanted your help
in co-ordinating our work.

316
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:47,970
What do you want to buy?

317
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:52,558
I won't be coy.
We want the whole place.

318
00:25:52,642 --> 00:25:58,731
We want to buy everything from the
cliffs to the bay and a mile inland.

319
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:00,400
That's all.

320
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:04,780
Well, you're talking about
15...maybe 20 properties.

321
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,743
You're talking about families,
businesses, farms.

322
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:11,871
You're talking about a lot of money.

323
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:15,291
We don't have to go
into figures right now.

324
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:18,294
I have a breakdown
on the properties.

325
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:22,215
I think it's a matter
of making a collective deal.

326
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:29,473
Why don't you get to know the place.
Take a day or so...I'll let you know.

327
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,809
How about that?

328
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:36,272
OK, if you think
it'll take that long.

329
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:38,900
- The church, too?
- Yes.

330
00:26:38,984 --> 00:26:42,278
The Church has definite views
about property.

331
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:44,406
See the beach, relax.

332
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,619
- Then you'll work out some numbers?
- I'll do my best.

333
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:51,164
Cheerio.

334
00:26:59,756 --> 00:27:01,675
Take it away, Andrew.

335
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,638
Oh, boy, are we going to be rich!

336
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:09,100
We're going to sell this hotel...

337
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:11,352
# Oh, oh, oh, oh...

338
00:27:11,435 --> 00:27:14,147
# Oh, I know you #

339
00:27:15,773 --> 00:27:20,988
# Oh, Mr Macintyre,
I know you, too #

340
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,155
Stella!

341
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:32,875
Thank you.

342
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,343
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

343
00:27:45,222 --> 00:27:46,974
Oh...

344
00:27:53,314 --> 00:27:56,234
What do you make of Urquhart, then?

345
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:58,278
He smells the money.

346
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:03,408
- Nice beach this, isn't it?
- Yeah.

347
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:07,246
We should come here
when we have to discuss business.

348
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,790
The hotel's too public.

349
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,084
Right.

350
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:16,214
That's where the jetty will be,

351
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,719
and the storage tanks over here,
all the way up.

352
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,639
Looks just like the model,
doesn't it?

353
00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:28,686
- Well, more expensive.
- Oh, it's some business.

354
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:32,231
It's the only business.

355
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:36,235
Could you imagine
a world without oil?

356
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,238
No automobiles.

357
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:41,616
- No heat.
- And polish.

358
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,245
- No ink.
- And nylon.

359
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,789
No detergents.

360
00:28:47,873 --> 00:28:51,252
Perspex.
You wouldn't get any Perspex.

361
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:53,254
No polythene.

362
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:55,257
Dry cleaning fluid.

363
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:00,261
Waterproofs. They make
dry cleaning fluid out of oil?

364
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:04,266
- Did you not know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

365
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:07,979
You know anything
about the stars?

366
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:10,606
Not much. Why?

367
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:15,445
I want to check something out.
I'll get a book or something.

368
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:23,036
It's business time in Houston.
I want to make some calls.

369
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:32,505
Can I help you, gentlemen?

370
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:35,091
Is there a telephone in the hotel?

371
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,677
There's a phone box across the road.

372
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:39,638
You'll need some change.

373
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:42,182
You can talk
to anywhere in the world.

374
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:46,603
- Could you change this? Tens.
- I don't think we'll manage that.

375
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,774
You got any tens, lads?

376
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:55,070
This gentleman would like to make an
important long-distance phone call.

377
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:59,826
Give us your tens.
Sandy! Any 10 pences?

378
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,957
Hey, hey, hey!

379
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:10,171
Aye, Ricky's on the road tonight.
You got to look both ways.

380
00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:20,474
- There , Mr Mac. Full working order.
- Thanks. I'm fine now.

381
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:22,601
You don't have to do that.

382
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:24,936
- Have you got the code?
- I got the code.

383
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,064
You could call the operator.

384
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:30,234
Put the tens in
when you hear the pips.

385
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:33,780
- I'm fine. I'll see you later.
- Oh, aye.

386
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:36,115
- No. Later on.
- Oh, right.

387
00:30:36,198 --> 00:30:37,993
Bye-bye. Thanks again.

388
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:44,166
Bye! You've been a big help! Bye.

389
00:30:46,043 --> 00:30:50,006
'Thank you for calling
Knox Oil and Gas.'

390
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,676
'Thank you for calling
Knox Oil and Gas.'

391
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,388
Thank you for calling
Knox Oil and Gas.

392
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:05,105
'Thank you for calling
Knox Oil and Gas.'

393
00:31:05,188 --> 00:31:09,902
OK! OK! Get me Calvin Wrain
in Acquisitions and Negotiations,

394
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:13,782
- and hurry, please.
- Hold, please.

395
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,743
This is Wrain.

396
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:19,496
- 'Cal! I'm in a phone box!'
- Mac, how are you!

397
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,041
Listen. Take this number...
Ferness, 261.

398
00:31:23,124 --> 00:31:28,589
You'll have to look up the code.
I'll give you other numbers later.

399
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:36,555
'Cal! How are things, boy?'

400
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:40,352
Fine, Mac.
You only been gone a couple of days.

401
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:43,021
'Feels like I've been here forever.'

402
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:45,274
Well, how's the deal going?

403
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:49,194
May take some time.
They've got a real nice beach here.

404
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:31,699
Moritz, Moritz, you're destroying me.

405
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:38,123
Yes. Now we're getting somewhere.
I think we can move on.

406
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,959
- What do you mean?
- The next stage.

407
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,712
- Physicalise things a little.
- What?

408
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:47,007
I could hit you.
Wouldn't that humiliate you?

409
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,385
I could tie you up.

410
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,554
That's perversion, not therapy.

411
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,931
Get out, and don't come back.

412
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:58,436
Good! You're upset. Think what
it'll be like when I punch you.

413
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,230
Get out before I punch you!

414
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:06,319
This is most gratifying, Mr Happer.
It vindicates my entire theory.

415
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:10,282
I've got your ego on the run,
you piece of shit!

416
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:13,118
Sorry, sir, that just slipped out.

417
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:16,289
We can't give up now.
You're a star patient.

418
00:33:16,372 --> 00:33:19,918
I might have to raise my fee
when we do get physical,

419
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:22,462
but it won't be unreasonable!

420
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:31,179
Mrs Wyatt, cancel all future
appointments with Moritz...

421
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:32,682
and get me Hawaii.

422
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:35,184
I want Fisher at the observatory.

423
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:06,968
Hello, Danny.
Good morning, Mr Macintyre.

424
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:14,769
We'll give "Yur-gu-hart" 24 hours.

425
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:15,770
Yeah...

426
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:18,731
Look at the birds.

427
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:20,734
They look like seagulls.

428
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:25,739
No. They're too small for seagulls,
and they're not white.

429
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:27,783
They'll get wet.

430
00:34:28,742 --> 00:34:30,786
Maybe they're waterproof.

431
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,041
Huh! You get waterproof birds?

432
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:37,168
Oh, yeah. Sure you do.

433
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:10,329
Let's check out the church,
talk to the preacher.

434
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,456
I want to do something.

435
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:22,008
Do you think Gordon
and Stella do it every night?

436
00:35:22,092 --> 00:35:24,135
Of course not.

437
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:35,314
Please, everyone. Will you calm down?

438
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:39,361
Nobody's mentioned money yet.
Don't get excited!

439
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,614
Quiet, please! Everyone!

440
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,451
Thanks, Murdo.

441
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:49,496
All I need just now
is your OK to negotiate.

442
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,710
I've got the Knox man on the hook.
Give me time to land him in style.

443
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:57,088
He's got a bag full of money.

444
00:35:57,172 --> 00:36:00,091
So stay calm and let me handle him.

445
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:03,887
I need your patience and faith.
Trust me.

446
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:07,850
Would they be wanting
to buy a boat, too?

447
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,852
Gideon, if things go well,

448
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:13,815
they'll have to buy
their own shirts back off us.

449
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:16,484
Stay calm. Trust me.

450
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:20,530
Gordon, I'd like
to say a short prayer now.

451
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:22,449
Fine, Murdo.

452
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:27,413
Quiet, please, everyone.
Murdo wants to say a short prayer.

453
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:29,665
Lord...

454
00:36:29,748 --> 00:36:34,837
It's the Yank and the other one!
They're coming here! I saw them.

455
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:38,175
Quiet, please.
Murdo, can you deal with them?

456
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:41,970
- Just head them off.
- Not a sound, please! Oh, God.

457
00:36:48,894 --> 00:36:51,605
This is where the canteen will be.

458
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:55,484
- What's that?
- Where you have lunch and dinner.

459
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:58,530
- Oh, a commissary.
- That kind of thing.

460
00:36:58,613 --> 00:37:01,115
Good morning! Can I help you?

461
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,827
- Reverend MacPherson?
- Yes.

462
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,413
My name's Macintyre. This is Oldsen.

463
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:10,417
Macintyre, eh?
You're not Scottish, are you?

464
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,797
- I'm an American.
- I'm not a Scotsman either.

465
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,423
I'm an African.

466
00:37:15,506 --> 00:37:20,762
I came here as a student minister
and didn't ever get away again.

467
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:22,681
What can I do for you?

468
00:37:22,764 --> 00:37:25,433
We're here on...kind of a mission.

469
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:27,394
Same here.

470
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,688
We want to acquire real estate.

471
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:34,735
We'd like to establish relationships
with those who have land hereabouts.

472
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,946
You want to buy my church?

473
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:40,241
Well, not as a going concern.

474
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:51,253
They practise here.

475
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:57,260
As long as they're bombing the beach,
they can't be bombing anywhere else.

476
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,262
It's kind of comforting.

477
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:03,642
Ahh...so far as
your business here is concerned,

478
00:38:03,725 --> 00:38:08,272
all I can recommend
is that you talk to our Mr Urquhart.

479
00:38:08,356 --> 00:38:11,025
He looks after
the church's interests,

480
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:13,235
in temporal matters, at least.

481
00:38:13,318 --> 00:38:16,906
I understand.
Sounds like good advice, Reverend.

482
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:19,492
I know I don't have to ask you, sir,

483
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:23,246
but could you treat our conversation
with confidence?

484
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,251
I give you my word, I will be
as discreet as the next man.

485
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:28,669
Thank you.

486
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:31,630
But news tends
to travel fast around here.

487
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:33,883
I understand, sir.

488
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:38,513
The Reverend says
news travels fast around here.

489
00:38:38,555 --> 00:38:40,265
- Hmm!
- Hmm!

490
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:45,270
Don't know why I'm here.

491
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:47,689
I'm more of a telex man.

492
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:52,695
Could sew this whole deal up
in one afternoon over the wires.

493
00:38:52,778 --> 00:38:55,698
That's the kind of person I am.

494
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,659
I need electricity.

495
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:06,876
Don't know about those jets.
They really spoil a very nice area.

496
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,130
- Oh, it's a crime.
- Yeah.

497
00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:38,286
- May I have another roll?
- Certainly.

498
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,831
- Who's that old man on the beach?
- That'd be Ben.

499
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:44,501
- He lives there all year?
- Oh, yes.

500
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:47,379
- Doesn't he get cold?
- He's used to it.

501
00:39:47,462 --> 00:39:50,925
- How's the casserole de lapin?
- Terrific.

502
00:39:56,723 --> 00:39:58,725
Lapin...

503
00:39:58,808 --> 00:40:00,935
That's rabbit.

504
00:40:04,815 --> 00:40:07,275
- Is this my rabbit?
- Yes.

505
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,403
- Harry!
- Trudi.

506
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:12,281
We don't allow animals
in the bedrooms.

507
00:40:12,364 --> 00:40:17,120
It's a pet! It had a name!
You don't eat things with names.

508
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:20,123
It was an injured rabbit.
It was in pain.

509
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:24,085
You were a bit hasty.
Mac was looking after it.

510
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:27,965
All it needed was lots of rest
and proper treatment.

511
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:30,300
Mac was on top of the situation.

512
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:32,470
They didn't like the rabbit.

513
00:40:32,553 --> 00:40:37,099
Mac loved the rabbit!
That's the point. It had a name!

514
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:39,853
Is it worthwhile calling the vet?

515
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,106
Don't be a clown, Gordon.
Make some coffee.

516
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:47,736
It had a broken leg. Check the bones
if you don't believe me.

517
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,075
I'm sorry, Mac,
but we eat rabbits here.

518
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,536
The vet would have done the same.

519
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,664
I didn't know it had a name.

520
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,582
It's OK, Stella.

521
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,085
Look, you don't have to finish it.

522
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,672
- How was it, anyway?
- It was nice.

523
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,926
Apart from it being Trudi,
it was nice.

524
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,096
What lovely long eyelashes
you've got.

525
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,684
Was it a wine sauce?

526
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:18,102
Yeah.

527
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:23,066
I let it simmer for
a couple of hours in some white wine.

528
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:25,610
Why did you call it Trudi?

529
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:27,738
No reason.

530
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:55,309
Apart from anything else,
a Rolls Royce will last longer.

531
00:41:55,392 --> 00:41:58,688
It's a false economy
to invest in cheap goods.

532
00:41:58,771 --> 00:42:02,901
It's not cheap. The Maserati's
30,000, and it looks nicer.

533
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:07,614
You can't get four or five winter
lambs into the back of a Maserati.

534
00:42:07,697 --> 00:42:11,410
That's what you need a Rolls for.
Space, adaptability.

535
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:16,249
Are you sure there are two "L"s
in "dollar", Gideon?

536
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:17,917
Yes!

537
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:23,757
And are there two "G"s
in "bugger off"?

538
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,303
- Andrew, knock it off for a bit.
- OK.

539
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:29,846
Thanks.

540
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,765
Coffee.

541
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:36,896
Ta.

542
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:40,650
Stella?

543
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:42,068
You busy?

544
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:45,072
No. Just fixing lunch.

545
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:05,051
Andrew!

546
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:08,264
- It's OK, you can start again now.
- Right!

547
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:12,976
Don't wave your arm so much.

548
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,564
- I got six.
- I got a 10 before. You missed it.

549
00:43:16,647 --> 00:43:20,485
I think 10's the maximum you can get
before it sinks.

550
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:24,322
- It's a scientific law.
- But it's the size, as well.

551
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:28,327
A middle size seems to work
the best, you know?

552
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,413
I'll check out the beach. Coming?

553
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:33,416
No. You go ahead.

554
00:43:33,499 --> 00:43:37,628
I'll hang around here,
maybe catch Urquhart later.

555
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:40,632
Hey, I said it! Urquhart!

556
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:42,550
Gordon Urquhart.

557
00:43:42,842 --> 00:43:45,012
Gordon Urquhart.

558
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,996
- Working hard?
- Fixing the creels.

559
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,999
Trying to keep lobsters in
and crabs out.

560
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:16,212
- What do you do with the lobsters?
- They catch a plane.

561
00:44:16,295 --> 00:44:21,718
Next day, they're being eaten in
London or Paris. They see the world!

562
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:26,055
- Don't you eat them?
- Oh, no. Too expensive.

563
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:28,559
You work here as well as the bar?

564
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:33,272
Oh, aye. We all muck in together,
do any job that's needing done.

565
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:34,357
Aye.

566
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,318
Have you only got one job?

567
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,362
Yeah. Just one.

568
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:42,365
The telephone box all right for you?

569
00:44:42,448 --> 00:44:43,908
It's fine.

570
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:47,746
Gideon's going to give it
a fresh coat of paint.

571
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:50,750
Any particular colour you'd like?

572
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:53,335
Red's all right. Red's fine.

573
00:44:53,419 --> 00:44:56,339
The cord could be
a little longer, though.

574
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:59,342
In America, the cords
are a bit longer.

575
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:01,219
Whose baby?

576
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:43,056
Come down!

577
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,436
Come here. I want to talk to you.

578
00:46:04,746 --> 00:46:06,790
Baby coral.

579
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,752
You're Mr What's-his-name from Knox.

580
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:14,632
- Danny. We met in Aberdeen.
- I remember.

581
00:46:14,716 --> 00:46:16,717
Did you swim all the way?

582
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:19,720
No. I stay here a lot.
This is my bay.

583
00:46:19,804 --> 00:46:23,725
I'm working on a biological profile
of the whole area.

584
00:46:23,808 --> 00:46:26,603
- Didn't Geddes tell you?
- Not really.

585
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:31,858
I'm plotting everything from the
two headlands to the high-tide mark.

586
00:46:31,942 --> 00:46:35,279
- How's the water? Cold?
- It should be colder.

587
00:46:35,363 --> 00:46:40,326
The North Atlantic Drift comes in
here. Warm water from the Caribbean.

588
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,704
That's why it's special here.

589
00:46:42,787 --> 00:46:45,749
Stuff fetches up here
from the Bahamas.

590
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:47,709
That's a long way.

591
00:46:47,793 --> 00:46:50,880
- You swim?
- Not that far.

592
00:46:53,382 --> 00:46:57,303
- How are things in the village?
- OK.

593
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:01,807
They're good people.
Let me know if I can help.

594
00:47:13,028 --> 00:47:14,864
Good afternoon.

595
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:17,533
I'd like some toothpaste, please.

596
00:47:17,575 --> 00:47:20,620
Something with fluoride or ammonia.

597
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:23,665
And, uh, some shampoo.

598
00:47:23,748 --> 00:47:26,835
Dry, normal, or greasy?

599
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:30,714
Normal. Extra normal.

600
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:34,260
That's normal.

601
00:47:34,343 --> 00:47:36,929
It'll do your dandruff, as well.

602
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,603
They've been smelling the money
since you two got here.

603
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:45,939
Do you know why we're here?

604
00:47:46,023 --> 00:47:48,817
Of course.
It's my project, isn't it?

605
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,238
- Your project?
- The marine laboratory here.

606
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:56,784
I sent the proposal months ago.
You're here to check it out, right?

607
00:47:56,868 --> 00:48:00,246
- Don't be coy.
- Sure. The marine laboratory.

608
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:04,376
I know it's only a public relations
number for Knox now,

609
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:06,503
but the future's in here.

610
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:09,215
Actually,
I'm not a very good swimmer.

611
00:48:09,298 --> 00:48:12,050
Listen, when can I see you again?

612
00:48:12,134 --> 00:48:14,512
I'm always around. I'll pop up soon.

613
00:48:14,595 --> 00:48:17,890
- Have you enough air to get home?
- Sure.

614
00:48:17,974 --> 00:48:20,977
- Well, take care anyway.
- See you.

615
00:48:21,061 --> 00:48:24,606
Have you got a telephone number
or anything?

616
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,330
- No.
- No?

617
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,207
That's all it is.

618
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,210
No.

619
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,212
A little one over here?

620
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,214
No.

621
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,593
You could paint that out,
put this here.

622
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:31,803
No.

623
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:33,389
No, huh?

624
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:34,890
No.

625
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:38,937
We don't see the point.
Just ask him to make us an offer.

626
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,148
It's not that simple.
We can't appear too eager.

627
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:45,277
We string him along,
and the price goes up.

628
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,864
- What if he pulls out?
- It's too much of a gamble.

629
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:51,867
Ask him what he has to offer.

630
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:55,496
- A half pint for you?
- Aye, and a whisky.

631
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:59,125
I told you I needed
your trust and your patience.

632
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:02,044
Let me take the strain. Relax.

633
00:50:02,128 --> 00:50:06,257
Give me till the Ceilidh, at least.
24 hours.

634
00:50:08,176 --> 00:50:11,263
OK. We'll talk at the Ceilidh.

635
00:50:13,348 --> 00:50:16,227
Nice to see you in here,
Mr Macintyre.

636
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,853
Mr Urquhart.

637
00:50:17,937 --> 00:50:20,272
I want you to try something.

638
00:50:22,942 --> 00:50:25,236
This is the MacAskill.

639
00:50:26,029 --> 00:50:28,073
Pure malt whisky.

640
00:50:28,157 --> 00:50:30,242
42 years old.

641
00:50:31,368 --> 00:50:33,829
Old enough to be out on his own.

642
00:50:35,623 --> 00:50:37,666
Very true.

643
00:50:39,752 --> 00:50:41,045
Hmm.

644
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:44,090
- Sláinte!
- Yeah.

645
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:50,513
- I want to talk to you.
- Good.

646
00:50:50,597 --> 00:50:54,268
It's not about
buying people's feelings,

647
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,438
it's about
taking feelings into account.

648
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:58,648
I agree.

649
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:02,986
Massive disturbance,
resettlement, lives being restarted.

650
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,238
Sounds like a lot of money.

651
00:51:05,322 --> 00:51:09,243
One way, it strikes me,
might be a trust fund

652
00:51:09,326 --> 00:51:11,620
over and above a purchase price.

653
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:17,418
Say, a lump sum, plus a percentage
of the profits over 10 or 20 years

654
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:20,629
with some local trustees
and some Knox ones.

655
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:24,467
We have to decide on a basic price
before the frills.

656
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:29,139
I'll get you a fixed price
averaging over the whole area.

657
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:32,935
We have to be talking about millions.

658
00:51:34,437 --> 00:51:36,272
Maybe.

659
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:40,610
What kind of millions
are we talking about?

660
00:51:40,693 --> 00:51:43,279
We'll have to talk about that.

661
00:51:46,366 --> 00:51:49,035
Say, a target figure of maybe...

662
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:51,872
20 million.

663
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:55,876
- For the trust?
- For the community, yes.

664
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:59,088
Pounds.

665
00:51:59,881 --> 00:52:01,924
Dollars, maybe.

666
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:09,058
- It's a nice evening, though.
- Pretty.

667
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:40,425
Good evening, Ben.

668
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:43,386
Aye. Oh, it's
a pleasant night, Gordon.

669
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:46,390
This is Macintyre.
He's staying with us.

670
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:48,808
How do you do, Mr Macintyre?

671
00:52:48,892 --> 00:52:53,105
I'd offer you a cup of tea,
but there's only the one other cup.

672
00:52:53,188 --> 00:52:56,149
- We don't mind sharing.
- Not in the least.

673
00:52:56,233 --> 00:52:58,069
No sugar, though, please.

674
00:53:02,156 --> 00:53:06,953
Macintyre was asking me how much
I thought the bay was worth, Ben.

675
00:53:16,172 --> 00:53:20,009
Oh, that's a good one,
right enough, Gordon!

676
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:35,693
Do you know about the stars, Ben?

677
00:53:35,776 --> 00:53:39,364
Well, I know my way around this sky.

678
00:53:39,447 --> 00:53:41,532
What about comets? Any around?

679
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:44,660
Did you want to buy a comet, as well?

680
00:53:45,037 --> 00:53:46,538
Maybe.

681
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:48,623
If you want to find a comet,

682
00:53:48,707 --> 00:53:52,962
you just have to look long enough
in the right place.

683
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:55,547
Where would you look?

684
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:57,759
I would look in Leo,

685
00:53:57,842 --> 00:54:03,056
but it seems like an awful lot
of trouble just to find a comet.

686
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,724
What about Virgo?

687
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,602
You never mentioned
comets before.

688
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:10,773
That's a whole new area
of negotiation.

689
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,695
We'll leave you in peace now, Ben.

690
00:54:15,778 --> 00:54:20,824
We're having a Ceilidh tomorrow after
Mac and I have tidied up some work.

691
00:54:20,908 --> 00:54:23,912
I'll be there, Gordon.
You can count on me.

692
00:54:23,995 --> 00:54:26,039
Jesus, look.

693
00:54:26,414 --> 00:54:29,793
Holy cow! Jesus!

694
00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:33,839
Calm down, Mac.
It's just a meteor shower.

695
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:46,626
Morning, Andrew.

696
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:49,170
Good morning, Mr Mac.

697
00:55:50,797 --> 00:55:52,841
I'll see you later, then.

698
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:05,980
Mr Macintyre!

699
00:56:06,064 --> 00:56:08,274
Telephone. It's a Mr Houston.

700
00:56:17,952 --> 00:56:21,665
- Macintyre. Hello.
- 'This is Happer. How are things?'

701
00:56:21,748 --> 00:56:23,416
Sir, they're fine.

702
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,376
'The deal is about there.'

703
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,130
- What about the sky?
- 'It's amazing!'

704
00:56:28,213 --> 00:56:31,049
There's always
a lot happening in it.

705
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:34,637
Last night there was a meteor shower.

706
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,184
- Where was the shower?
- In the sky. They came down.

707
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:41,102
What part of the sky?

708
00:56:41,185 --> 00:56:46,066
'I don't know, but I'm told that
comet-wise, Leo may be worth a look.'

709
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:49,819
Should I switch from Virgo?
I'll have time later.

710
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:52,990
No. Do both, Macintyre.
Leo and Virgo.

711
00:56:53,073 --> 00:56:55,868
Have you ever seen
a meteor shower, sir?

712
00:56:55,951 --> 00:56:58,955
Once or twice.
It's a sight worth seeing.

713
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:02,833
- I know how you must feel.
- 'Yes, Mr Happer.'

714
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:06,421
- I'll keep in touch.
- 'Goodbye, sir.'

715
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:29,654
'Next week, Professor Wiley
will be talking about his theory...'

716
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:36,412
'..based on his researches into
interplanetary gravitational effect.

717
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:39,582
'From Astronomy Tomorrow,
good night.'

718
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,084
Yes?

719
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,127
- 'Happer?'
- Yes.

720
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:47,591
'You're a shit, Happer.
A useless piece of crap.'

721
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:49,551
Get off the phone, Moritz.

722
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:53,013
I don't need you any more.
You're not being paid.

723
00:57:53,097 --> 00:57:56,892
'This is doing more good
than the formal sessions.'

724
00:57:56,975 --> 00:58:01,564
Leave me alone, or I'll call
the police. This is harassment.

725
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:04,943
'Asshole, Happer!
You love it! Craphound!'

726
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:26,674
'I'm still here, Happer,
and you're still a useless mo...'

727
00:59:04,215 --> 00:59:06,676
You seem to like this place.

728
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,764
I like the scenery.

729
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,941
Grey seals.

730
00:59:59,025 --> 01:00:01,610
They look nice and friendly.

731
01:00:01,694 --> 01:00:04,948
A salmon fisherman
would shoot them on sight.

732
01:00:05,031 --> 01:00:07,784
They steal his fish
and ruin his nets.

733
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:11,038
They know what they're doing.
They're rascals.

734
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:15,710
We're keeping an eye on them. There's
only 50,000 left in the Atlantic.

735
01:00:15,793 --> 01:00:19,922
Sailors used to think
they were mermaids, yeah?

736
01:00:20,297 --> 01:00:23,051
Aye, they did. They were wrong.

737
01:00:24,636 --> 01:00:27,221
'General Store

Hello! Hello!

747
01:01:41,552 --> 01:01:43,596
How are you?

748
01:01:56,568 --> 01:02:00,239
- Good to see you, Victor.
- Good to see you, Gordon.

749
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,908
Watch the booze, Gordon.

750
01:02:02,992 --> 01:02:05,912
- Carry these.
- OK.

751
01:02:05,995 --> 01:02:07,372
Silly bitch.

752
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:11,376
This is plum brandy for Stella.
The rest is the usual.

753
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,920
How are things?
I heard about the Ceilidh.

754
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:16,924
Oh, yeah.
We've been invaded by America.

755
01:02:17,008 --> 01:02:21,428
We'll have nowhere to call home,
but we'll be stinking rich.

756
01:02:21,512 --> 01:02:23,431
Are the Americans here?

757
01:02:23,514 --> 01:02:28,020
Just one and a Scots kid. They're
on the beach taking long walks.

758
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:08,021
Paiyoo.

759
01:03:08,104 --> 01:03:10,357
It's Japanese.

760
01:03:10,941 --> 01:03:13,235

- Kisu.
- Kisu?

766
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,761
Kisu. Seppum.

767
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,937
You taste salty.

768
01:03:47,063 --> 01:03:49,149
You're on the fresh side.

769
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:08,961
I've got some insurance
policies for you to look at.

770
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:11,173
How do you make this add up?

771
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,804
Oh, Mac,
come and meet Victor Pinochkin.

772
01:04:18,097 --> 01:04:20,140
Victor, this is Mac.

773
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:22,685
Macintyre. Knox Oil and Gas, Houston.

774
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:25,855
Pinochkin.
Soviet fishing fleet, Murmansk.

775
01:04:25,938 --> 01:04:30,652
I'm here for the Ceilidh. We have
been buying fish in the Minch.

776
01:04:30,735 --> 01:04:33,113
You are doing some business, too?

777
01:04:33,196 --> 01:04:37,159
Yes. I think I'll go upstairs
and wash out these shells.

778
01:04:37,242 --> 01:04:39,286
What have you got there?

779
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:41,414
Is that a scallop shell?

780
01:04:42,248 --> 01:04:44,166
A very nice one.

781
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:48,088
This is a razor fish or razor clam.

782
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:52,760
They call them "spoots" around here.
You can eat them.

783
01:04:52,843 --> 01:04:57,264
Catching them is a problem, though.
They jet through the sand.

784
01:04:57,347 --> 01:05:01,268
- Strong little things.
- I wouldn't want to eat them.

785
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:08,568
- Come down for a drink later, Mac.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

786
01:05:11,196 --> 01:05:14,616
I left last year's money
on short-term deposit.

787
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:18,370
I didn't know when you might need it.

788
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:21,582
Wouldn't it work harder
on the money market?

789
01:05:21,665 --> 01:05:23,835
The amounts don't justify it.

790
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:27,213
Besides, the dollar's
all over the place now.

791
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:30,300
It's a full-time job
just monitoring it.

792
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:32,344
No, I see what you mean.

793
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:35,556
You should think again
about some property.

794
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:39,643
I'll be liquid after this Knox thing.
Come in with me.

795
01:05:39,726 --> 01:05:43,356
You know I'm a cash man, Gordon.
I'll have to think about it.

796
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:59,332
Hey, that's a ribbed mussel. Nice.

797
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:01,459
Yeah. And this is a scallop.

798
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:04,337
A bay scallop, I would say, actually.

799
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:07,340
Yeah, yeah,
and this is a razor shell.

800
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:10,511
So how's business?
Do you need any help?

801
01:06:10,594 --> 01:06:13,638
Urquhart's got
all the powers of attorney.

802
01:06:13,722 --> 01:06:16,600
We should have
a draft agreement by tonight.

803
01:06:16,684 --> 01:06:19,186
- So we've swung it?
- Looks like it.

804
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,313
No opposition at all?

805
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:25,651
They'll do all right.
We're not robbing anybody.

806
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:28,530
Do they know
what'll happen to the place?

807
01:06:28,613 --> 01:06:31,366
They'll be rich.
That's all they know.

808
01:06:31,449 --> 01:06:35,454
Could I borrow your ribbed mussel?
I want to show it to someone.

809
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:38,373
- Bring it back.
- First thing tomorrow.

810
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:41,169
- Thank you.
- Bye.

811
01:06:42,378 --> 01:06:44,213
Hey!

812
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:45,840
Yeah?

813
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:50,428
- Do you speak Russian?
- Yeah. That's one of mine.

814
01:06:50,512 --> 01:06:54,808
- You want my scallop, too?
- No, thanks. The mussel will do.

815
01:06:54,892 --> 01:06:58,854
- OK. See you at the Ceilidh, then.
- Right.

816
01:07:30,055 --> 01:07:32,891
- Please, come on.
- No. Thanks, but...

817
01:07:32,974 --> 01:07:36,478
- You don't want to dance with me?
- It's not that...

818
01:07:36,562 --> 01:07:39,231
It'll be good. Just enjoy yourself.

819
01:07:41,442 --> 01:07:43,694
Yee-hah!

820
01:07:58,669 --> 01:08:00,921
Yeee-hah!

821
01:08:01,005 --> 01:08:04,384
If we call the useless land
- the beach and cliffs -

822
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:08,054
one third of the price of
the working land and the village,

823
01:08:08,137 --> 01:08:10,807
the average price is 2,000 per acre.

824
01:08:10,891 --> 01:08:12,476
Sounds fine.

825
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:17,606
I'm asking for 5% of revenue over
10 years on top of the 10 million.

826
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:19,858
I can't say on the percentage.

827
01:08:19,942 --> 01:08:21,986
You can have the 10 million

828
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:25,281
plus participation to be
mutually...etcetera etcetera.

829
01:08:27,491 --> 01:08:29,411
There's Victor's song.

830
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:46,429
# Guess that I was born to be a rover

831
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:54,688
# Guess I've always been
a rolling stone

832
01:08:56,898 --> 01:09:02,446
# But someday when
my roving days are over

833
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:10,372
# I will find a place to call my own

834
01:09:12,624 --> 01:09:18,797
# Cos even the lone stars,
they get lonesome

835
01:09:21,383 --> 01:09:27,181
# Lonesome as a lost ship on the sea

836
01:09:29,726 --> 01:09:35,399
# Even the lone stars,
they get lonesome

837
01:09:37,818 --> 01:09:43,199
# Lonesome for
a lone star man like me... #

838
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:48,163
A 42-year-old whisky, Roddy.

839
01:09:48,246 --> 01:09:50,290
We've none of that tonight.

840
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:53,794
Give me four eight-year olds
and a ten-year old!

841
01:09:53,877 --> 01:09:55,587
Aye, that adds up.

842
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:59,717
Yeah! Ha ha!

843
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:07,767
# Even the lone stars,
they get lonesome

844
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:15,900
# Lonesome for
a lone star man like me

845
01:10:17,987 --> 01:10:22,617
# Lonesome for a lone star

846
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:26,287
# Man

847
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:28,457
# Like

848
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:34,171
# Me #

849
01:10:36,757 --> 01:10:38,383
Yeah!

850
01:10:44,932 --> 01:10:47,894
Four generations
of working that farm,

851
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:51,105
digging and draining and planting.

852
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:54,067
Years and years,
and it comes to this.

853
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:56,111
Strange times, Archie.

854
01:10:56,194 --> 01:10:59,740
What was it Gordon Urquhart
offered you?

855
01:10:59,824 --> 01:11:02,201
1.5 million in cash,

856
01:11:02,284 --> 01:11:07,582
plus 2% of the relocation fund,
and a share in the oil field revenue.

857
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:10,586
Aye, strange times. Strange times.

858
01:11:28,563 --> 01:11:30,106
No, no.

859
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:33,401
- Come on, what do you say?
- What do I say what?

860
01:11:33,485 --> 01:11:35,904
- Let's haggle.
- Haggle?

861
01:11:35,988 --> 01:11:38,031
Dollars or pounds?

862
01:11:38,115 --> 01:11:40,660
The 2,000 per, or the 10 million?

863
01:11:40,743 --> 01:11:44,663
- Pounds. Let's say pounds.
- Come on, Mac. Negotiate!

864
01:11:44,747 --> 01:11:49,085
Whatever you want, Gordon.
Pounds, yen, roubles. You name it.

865
01:11:58,512 --> 01:12:00,514
It was only £40 at Christmas.

866
01:12:00,598 --> 01:12:03,600
You were only charging
two at Christmas.

867
01:12:03,684 --> 01:12:07,480
Inflation's going up all the time.
Spiralling costs.

868
01:12:07,563 --> 01:12:10,233
Anyway Alan's got a new guitar.

869
01:12:10,317 --> 01:12:13,612
- You're a fiver short, Murdo.
- Sorry, Gordon.

870
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:18,158
- You'll still help with the waltz?
- Oh, aye.

871
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,139
Come on, Mac. Get your jacket off.

872
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:41,309
We're waltzing. Come on.

873
01:12:54,698 --> 01:12:56,616
Ah, it's James Stewart.

874
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,619
That's Humphrey Bogart.

875
01:12:58,703 --> 01:13:01,163
Watch, watch. Who's this?

876
01:13:02,706 --> 01:13:05,126
Well, that would be James Stewart.

877
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,128
No. That's Cary Grant.

878
01:13:07,211 --> 01:13:09,255
This is Jimmy Stewart.

879
01:13:11,216 --> 01:13:13,677
Ah, Humphrey Bogart.

880
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,555
No. That was James Stewart.

881
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:42,148
What were you dancing
with that prat for?

882
01:14:42,231 --> 01:14:43,649
What?

883
01:14:43,733 --> 01:14:47,779
I saw you chasing that guy
all over the dance floor.

884
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:50,907
What's so special about him?

885
01:14:52,408 --> 01:14:54,494
He's different.

886
01:14:54,578 --> 01:14:57,038
Bloody right he's different.

887
01:14:57,622 --> 01:15:01,752
Cheer up.
You've made everybody very happy.

888
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:05,048
You're a success. Cheers.

889
01:15:10,469 --> 01:15:12,097
It's their place, Mac.

890
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:15,892
They have a right
to make what they can of it.

891
01:15:15,975 --> 01:15:18,896
You can't eat scenery.

892
01:15:18,979 --> 01:15:20,898
Cheers.

893
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:22,942
Yeah.

894
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:26,946
You speak a lot of sense
for an oilman.

895
01:16:10,702 --> 01:16:12,996
Is everyone celebrating?

896
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:15,123
Almost everyone.

897
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:18,877
When do I get the good news?

898
01:16:18,961 --> 01:16:21,338
I want to talk to you about that.

899
01:16:21,421 --> 01:16:24,092
There's a kind of alternative plan.

900
01:16:24,175 --> 01:16:26,469
Geddes has all the details.

901
01:16:26,552 --> 01:16:30,807
- What do you mean?
- It's an oil terminal or something.

902
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:36,688
No. I don't see that happening here.
I don't see that at all.

903
01:16:37,856 --> 01:16:40,275
Holy mackerel! What's happening?

904
01:16:40,358 --> 01:16:43,863
It's just the northern lights.
Aurora borealis.

905
01:16:43,946 --> 01:16:47,450
High energy protons
spilling into our atmosphere.

906
01:16:47,534 --> 01:16:51,454
They get through the magnetic shield
at the poles.

907
01:16:51,537 --> 01:16:54,916
It's still beautiful,
whatever you call it.

908
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,211
- How often does this happen?
- Oh, any old time.

909
01:16:58,295 --> 01:17:04,176
It's best when the sun's active.
That gets the solar wind up.

910
01:17:05,678 --> 01:17:08,764
You say the darnedest things, Marina.

911
01:17:11,309 --> 01:17:14,229
I don't feel sick.
I just feel a wee bit dizzy.

912
01:17:14,312 --> 01:17:18,025
I'll put a bit of colour
into your cheeks, darlin'!

913
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:22,655
What's happening up there?

914
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:24,866
That's the northern lights, Mac.

915
01:17:24,949 --> 01:17:27,159
What the heck is that?

916
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:31,414
It's pretty technical.
Nice though, isn't it?

917
01:17:33,374 --> 01:17:35,627
Hey, everybody! I need tens.

918
01:17:35,711 --> 01:17:41,175
I got to have tens.
I have to...I need tens.

919
01:17:42,426 --> 01:17:47,682
'Thank you
for calling Knox Oil and Gas.'

920
01:17:47,766 --> 01:17:50,226
'Mr Macintyre in Scotland.

921
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:52,855
'Should I transfer him
to Mr Fountain?'

922
01:17:52,938 --> 01:17:54,731
No. Let me have him.

923
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,858
Happer here, Macintyre.

924
01:17:56,942 --> 01:18:00,988
I'm watching the sky, sir.
It's doing some amazing things.

925
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:05,285
It's got everything, reds,
greens and kind of shimmering.

926
01:18:05,368 --> 01:18:09,497
'There's noise, too,
like a far-off thunder, only softer.'

927
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:13,126
I wish I could describe it
like I'm seeing it.

928
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:17,881
Be more specific. You're my eyes
and ears there. Give me details.

929
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:22,344
Sir, I'll give you the colours first.

930
01:18:22,427 --> 01:18:24,847
It's white and green and red...

931
01:18:24,931 --> 01:18:27,349
I'm sorry. That's the phone box.

932
01:18:27,433 --> 01:18:31,187
Oh, it's blue!
It's like a shower of colour!

933
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:33,731
Tell him it's the aurora borealis.

934
01:18:33,815 --> 01:18:37,069
It's the aurora borealis,
but it's beautiful!

935
01:18:37,152 --> 01:18:39,321
You're a lucky man, Macintyre.

936
01:18:39,404 --> 01:18:42,575
I haven't seen the aurora
since '53 in Alaska.

937
01:18:42,658 --> 01:18:45,369
'I haven't seen a comet yet, sir.

938
01:18:45,452 --> 01:18:48,373
'I don't know if I'd spot one
in all this...'

939
01:18:48,456 --> 01:18:50,667
Moritz, you idiot!

940
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:54,504
'Ben said that meteors
are a good sign of a comet.'

941
01:18:54,588 --> 01:18:57,340
'That stuff we saw
the other night...'

942
01:18:57,424 --> 01:18:59,760
You nut! Get out!

943
01:18:59,844 --> 01:19:03,889
'..the future. With regard
to comets, of course...'

944
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:07,977
Moritz! Get off this building!
I'll have you certified!

945
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,104
'..things happening in the sky.'

946
01:19:10,187 --> 01:19:13,108
'As you suggested,
I'll watch Virgo as well.'

947
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:17,988
I'll let you know if anything...
God! It just went red all over!

948
01:19:18,072 --> 01:19:20,324
It's red all over!

949
01:19:28,124 --> 01:19:30,627
Mrs Wyatt, I'm leaving the office.

950
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,004
'Yes, sir.'

951
01:19:33,087 --> 01:19:37,467
And, Mrs Wyatt, there's a maniac
outside the building.

952
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:42,223
Call the police department.
Get some marksmen. Shoot him off.

953
01:19:42,306 --> 01:19:43,974
Shoot to kill.

954
01:19:55,112 --> 01:19:57,155
Pardon me.

955
01:20:23,184 --> 01:20:24,894
Oh, Gordon.

956
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:27,146
Oh, Gordon.

957
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:34,612
Well, Edward, I wonder what
the poor people are doing tonight.

958
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:41,037
Aye, but Peter, I thought all this
money would make me feel...different.

959
01:20:42,288 --> 01:20:44,206
What do you mean?

960
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:48,044
Well, all it's done
is make me feel depressed.

961
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,172
I don't feel any different.

962
01:20:51,255 --> 01:20:54,634
Well, Edward,
you'll just need to buck up.

963
01:20:54,718 --> 01:20:59,181
You need to accept the fact
you're stinking rich.

964
01:20:59,265 --> 01:21:04,979
Nobody ever said it was going
to be easy to be a millionaire, Ed.

965
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,241
I have a proposition for you, Gordon.

966
01:21:17,785 --> 01:21:24,167
I know I'm a bit tipsy, but I want
you to consider this seriously, OK?

967
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:26,252
- OK.
- OK.

968
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:30,799
I want to swap with you...

969
01:21:31,841 --> 01:21:33,426
everything.

970
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:36,930
I want to stay here,

971
01:21:37,973 --> 01:21:41,686
run the hotel,
do little bits of business.

972
01:21:41,769 --> 01:21:43,687
You can go to Houston.

973
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:46,690
Take the Porsche, the house, the job.

974
01:21:46,774 --> 01:21:49,235
It's a good life there, Gordon.

975
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:52,155
I pull down 80,000 a year,

976
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:56,368
plus I have over 50,000
in mixed securities.

977
01:21:57,619 --> 01:22:00,247
I want you to have it all.

978
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:09,465
There's nothing due on the car,
it's pure ownership.

979
01:22:09,548 --> 01:22:13,178
And I won't let down
your good name here, Gordon.

980
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,890
I'll make a good Gordon, Gordon.

981
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:19,393
What do you say, pal?

982
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,270
What about Stella?

983
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,440
I was coming to that.

984
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:29,404
I love her...very, very much.

985
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:31,322
She's wonderful.

986
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:35,327
She's the most beautiful woman
I've ever loved,

987
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:38,080
and I think she knows it.

988
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:43,419
I want you to leave Stella
here with me, Gordon.

989
01:22:43,502 --> 01:22:47,382
Would you do that?
Would you leave Stella here with me?

990
01:22:47,465 --> 01:22:49,509
Sure, Mac.

991
01:22:52,637 --> 01:22:54,973
You're a good guy, Gordon.

992
01:23:00,062 --> 01:23:02,940
Do you drive a car, Victor?

993
01:23:03,023 --> 01:23:07,195
Yes. I share a Volvo 144
estate with my brother-in-law.

994
01:23:08,196 --> 01:23:10,740
I drive a Porsche 930.

995
01:23:10,823 --> 01:23:14,411
What's the insurance
like on a Porsche?

996
01:23:14,494 --> 01:23:19,875
Very heavy, but I get a deal
through Knox Insurance.

997
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:22,002
Ah.

998
01:23:23,044 --> 01:23:24,880
You got hi-fi?

999
01:23:24,964 --> 01:23:27,091
Quad and video.

1000
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:30,011
I've got quad outfit, too.

1001
01:23:30,095 --> 01:23:32,430
Picked it up in Japan.

1002
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:36,518
Here's my address in Houston, Victor.

1003
01:23:36,602 --> 01:23:39,646
If you ever get to the States,
give me a call.

1004
01:23:39,729 --> 01:23:42,024
Thank you very much.

1005
01:23:42,108 --> 01:23:45,694
Let me give you my address
in Murmansk, too.

1006
01:23:45,778 --> 01:23:49,907
I'm not there a lot, but...
you never know!

1007
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,201
It's my card.

1008
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,374
How come you're here?

1009
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:02,796
Fishing.
I have been coming here for years.

1010
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:08,970
I like it here,
but it is tough life for the locals.

1011
01:24:09,053 --> 01:24:13,433
You should be proud of yourself,
making them millionaires.

1012
01:24:14,434 --> 01:24:17,271
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

1013
01:24:23,277 --> 01:24:27,656
- Breakfast ready, Gordon?
- We've a problem. Ben's beach.

1014
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:31,661
- What's the problem?
- It really is Ben's beach.

1015
01:24:31,744 --> 01:24:36,708
He owns the shoreline, four miles
of it. It's in the parish records.

1016
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:40,837
- Can he prove it?
- We can't steal the beach from him.

1017
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:44,842
- Buy it from him.
- It's not in our budget.

1018
01:24:44,925 --> 01:24:46,885
We didn't allow for this.

1019
01:24:46,969 --> 01:24:51,140
Work out a price.
Steal something from the trust fund.

1020
01:24:51,224 --> 01:24:53,602
Does he know he owns it?

1021
01:24:53,685 --> 01:24:56,730
Can't you stick in
some more money, Mac?

1022
01:24:56,813 --> 01:24:58,440
Mr Mac!

1023
01:24:58,523 --> 01:25:01,360
That was a telephone call
from America.

1024
01:25:01,443 --> 01:25:04,404
- A Mr Happer's coming to see you.
- Happer?

1025
01:25:04,488 --> 01:25:09,952
H-a-p-p...p-e-r.
They spelt it for me.

1026
01:25:10,036 --> 01:25:11,830
Oh, Jesus!

1027
01:25:11,913 --> 01:25:16,084
One million sterling and no more.
Then you're on your own.

1028
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:19,671
That includes the cliffs
and the rocks.

1029
01:25:19,755 --> 01:25:21,798
OK, Mac, I've got the message.

1030
01:25:27,346 --> 01:25:30,141
- Where's the door?
- There is no door.

1031
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:34,854
How do you do business with
someone who doesn't have a door?

1032
01:25:34,937 --> 01:25:37,149
The ethics are just the same.

1033
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:40,902
Ben, could I have a word with you?

1034
01:25:42,863 --> 01:25:46,867
- Ben, hello. You know Macintyre.
- Macintyre, aye.

1035
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:50,121
- This is Victor Pinochkin. Ben Knox.
- How do you do?

1036
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:56,169
- Your name is Knox?
- My name's Knox, yes.

1037
01:25:56,253 --> 01:25:58,713
Can we come in, or will you come out?

1038
01:25:58,797 --> 01:26:01,550
I'll just get the fire started.

1039
01:26:03,844 --> 01:26:07,056
- This is your beach, isn't it, Ben?
- Oh, yes.

1040
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:10,935
It's been in the family
for 400 years.

1041
01:26:11,018 --> 01:26:15,857
The Lord of the Isles
gave it to an ancestor of mine.

1042
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:18,902
He helped him out
with a spot of trouble.

1043
01:26:18,986 --> 01:26:22,656
Killed his brother for him...
something like that.

1044
01:26:22,739 --> 01:26:26,911
You have a deed or anything? Papers?

1045
01:26:26,994 --> 01:26:29,998
It's in the museum in Edinburgh.

1046
01:26:30,081 --> 01:26:32,292
It's a historical document.

1047
01:26:33,626 --> 01:26:35,128
Mac.

1048
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:37,756
Sure, sure. Ben...

1049
01:26:38,882 --> 01:26:40,967
What we wanted to ask you...

1050
01:26:42,094 --> 01:26:45,514
Have you ever thought about...moving?

1051
01:26:46,723 --> 01:26:48,309
Eh, no.

1052
01:26:48,393 --> 01:26:51,020
- No?
- No.

1053
01:26:51,604 --> 01:26:57,319
Macintyre represents some people who
think they have a use for the beach.

1054
01:26:57,402 --> 01:26:59,237
They want to pay you.

1055
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:02,574
- Money?
- A lot of money...

1056
01:27:02,658 --> 01:27:04,201
£100,000.

1057
01:27:06,954 --> 01:27:10,499
The thing is,
I'm still working the place myself.

1058
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:12,502
It's my living.

1059
01:27:12,586 --> 01:27:14,796
It supports me.

1060
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,841
You wouldn't have to work.

1061
01:27:17,925 --> 01:27:20,010
We all have to work.

1062
01:27:20,093 --> 01:27:22,304
The beach has to be worked.

1063
01:27:22,387 --> 01:27:25,308
Think of the state
it would get into.

1064
01:27:25,391 --> 01:27:26,809
Eh?

1065
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:45,079
Gordon,
can this music be turned off?

1066
01:27:45,162 --> 01:27:47,331
Oh, yeah.

1067
01:27:47,415 --> 01:27:50,376
- Don't you like this?
- No.

1068
01:27:51,419 --> 01:27:53,839
- You mean you've never liked it?
- No.

1069
01:27:54,172 --> 01:27:57,759
- Even when you first came?
- No.

1070
01:28:04,433 --> 01:28:07,979
Half a million pounds
is a lot of money, Ben,

1071
01:28:08,062 --> 01:28:10,898
enough to buy another beach with.

1072
01:28:11,483 --> 01:28:13,818
Look, I've got some postcards.

1073
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:16,404
I've got some very fine beaches here.

1074
01:28:16,487 --> 01:28:19,408
I want to make you an offer.

1075
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:23,161
How about this -
any beach that takes your fancy,

1076
01:28:23,245 --> 01:28:25,915
anywhere in the world,
I'll get for you.

1077
01:28:25,998 --> 01:28:28,417
Look at this - Hawaii.

1078
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:32,171
I can get you
five or six miles of Hawaii.

1079
01:28:32,255 --> 01:28:35,968
Or look here, Australia.
Look at that sand.

1080
01:28:36,051 --> 01:28:40,430
Oh, yes. They look like
very nice beaches, Mr Macintyre.

1081
01:28:40,513 --> 01:28:43,434
But, see, I only need the one.

1082
01:28:43,517 --> 01:28:46,645
I have this here.
I don't need another one.

1083
01:28:46,728 --> 01:28:52,485
Besides, I'm not sure that there's
a living in any of these beaches.

1084
01:28:52,568 --> 01:28:56,990
You've got to go into
that kind of thing in detail.

1085
01:28:57,073 --> 01:28:59,994
I'll buy you any beach you want,

1086
01:29:00,077 --> 01:29:03,997
and I'll give you £750,000
to set yourself up with.

1087
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:08,919
It'll give you some security
in the early stages. What do you say?

1088
01:29:09,003 --> 01:29:13,008
You're great at talking
with the big numbers...

1089
01:29:13,091 --> 01:29:17,053
- Say, look, you're good at numbers.
- Part of my job, yes.

1090
01:29:17,136 --> 01:29:20,057
Would you give me a pound note

1091
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,809
for every grain of sand in my hand?

1092
01:29:22,893 --> 01:29:25,354
You can have the beach for that.

1093
01:29:26,147 --> 01:29:29,066
There, I saved you
a pound or two there.

1094
01:29:29,149 --> 01:29:31,528
Ben, I don't want to play games.

1095
01:29:31,611 --> 01:29:34,447
Let's negotiate
in a businesslike way.

1096
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:36,575
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

1097
01:29:36,658 --> 01:29:40,578
You could have had
a very nice purchase, Mr Macintyre.

1098
01:29:40,662 --> 01:29:46,877
I can't hold much more than 10,000
grains of sand in my hand at a time.

1099
01:29:47,169 --> 01:29:51,048
Did you think it would be
a bigger number?

1100
01:29:51,174 --> 01:29:55,136
- You took advantage of me, Ben.
- Did I?

1101
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,555
How about a hatful of sand?

1102
01:29:57,639 --> 01:30:01,602
No, no.
That wouldn't be businesslike.

1103
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:18,620
Ahh.

1104
01:30:28,172 --> 01:30:31,259
Danny, get the wine glasses
without the stems.

1105
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:34,178
Sure. Would anyone
like more potatoes?

1106
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,723
- No.
- Yes, please.

1107
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:40,310
- Some roast, if you have them.
- Sure thing, Mr Knox.

1108
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,522
And, uh, a couple more sprouts.

1109
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:51,906
Is he going to sell?

1110
01:30:51,989 --> 01:30:54,242
He wants some more sprouts.

1111
01:30:54,326 --> 01:30:56,369
Here, let's have a look.

1112
01:31:02,751 --> 01:31:05,087
Want to buy a house, Andrew?

1113
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:07,423
I'm trying to sell one, Edward.

1114
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:15,598
Gordon, good night.
I've enjoyed myself.

1115
01:31:15,682 --> 01:31:17,100
Good.

1116
01:31:17,183 --> 01:31:18,644
Mr... Good night.

1117
01:31:20,687 --> 01:31:23,648
Can we have a word with you, Ben?

1118
01:31:30,698 --> 01:31:32,742
Let's walk him home.

1119
01:31:40,959 --> 01:31:44,963
400...500 people
could make a living here

1120
01:31:45,047 --> 01:31:47,507
if things were allowed to change.

1121
01:31:47,591 --> 01:31:50,636
- That wouldn't be the first time.
- What?

1122
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,471
Local history, Gordon.

1123
01:31:52,555 --> 01:31:56,184
This beach used to be
a good living for 300 people.

1124
01:31:56,268 --> 01:31:59,687
They gathered seaweed
and extracted the chemicals.

1125
01:31:59,772 --> 01:32:04,693
200 years ago, this beach
was turning over £15,000 a year.

1126
01:32:04,776 --> 01:32:08,197
Then the trade routes opened up
again to the east,

1127
01:32:08,281 --> 01:32:10,449
and so, "farewell, Ferness."

1128
01:32:10,533 --> 01:32:14,746
The business went,
but the beach is still here.

1129
01:32:17,875 --> 01:32:23,588
If you got the place, it would be
good-bye beach, forever, wouldn't it?

1130
01:32:36,812 --> 01:32:38,855
Have an orange, Gordon.

1131
01:32:40,857 --> 01:32:44,320
I found a box on Tuesday
in the rocks.

1132
01:32:46,363 --> 01:32:48,408
I found a coconut once.

1133
01:32:48,491 --> 01:32:50,535
Lord knows where that came from.

1134
01:32:50,618 --> 01:32:53,788
What's the most amazing thing
you ever found?

1135
01:32:53,872 --> 01:32:59,085
Impossible to say. There's something
amazing every two or three weeks.

1136
01:32:59,168 --> 01:33:01,839
I'll let you know the next time.

1137
01:33:02,881 --> 01:33:04,925
Good night.

1138
01:33:12,183 --> 01:33:14,227
Shit, this is South African.

1139
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:18,357
- Maybe we ought to stick around.
- No, he'll be all right.

1140
01:33:26,448 --> 01:33:27,700
Uh-oh.

1141
01:33:28,951 --> 01:33:31,037
They've taken the church road.

1142
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:40,714
Maybe they just want to talk to him.

1143
01:33:40,797 --> 01:33:43,676
- Think that's all?
- Oh, sure. Just talk.

1144
01:33:43,759 --> 01:33:47,012
There's
an awful lot of them.

1145
01:33:47,095 --> 01:33:48,848
Yeah.

1146
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:51,999
I'm travelling light, Macintyre.
One bag in the luggage compartment.

1147
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:55,003
You didn't need
to put on this reception.

1148
01:34:55,086 --> 01:34:57,047
This is an informal visit.

1149
01:34:57,130 --> 01:35:01,552
But now that I'm here,
I'd like to organise a presentation,

1150
01:35:01,635 --> 01:35:06,057
something these people might need,
a church hall, a piano, anything.

1151
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:09,060
I'd like to make a personal gift.

1152
01:35:09,143 --> 01:35:11,895
You can let me know
about it tomorrow.

1153
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:14,065
How about the sky, Macintyre?

1154
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:15,567
Anything new?

1155
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:18,070
Well, we'll talk about it later.

1156
01:35:18,153 --> 01:35:20,072
Thanks for the call.

1157
01:35:20,155 --> 01:35:22,616
Um, I...I...I'm not Macintyre, sir.

1158
01:35:22,699 --> 01:35:27,663
Where the hell is he?
I've been on the move for 24 hours.

1159
01:35:31,209 --> 01:35:34,086
- Are you Macintyre?
- Yes, sir.

1160
01:35:35,171 --> 01:35:37,799
- Get me a room.
- Yes, sir.

1161
01:35:37,883 --> 01:35:40,635
This is Gordon Urquhart, hotel...

1162
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,763
Yeah, hotel. This way, sir.

1163
01:35:46,058 --> 01:35:48,102
Get the luggage, Danny.

1164
01:35:52,231 --> 01:35:55,944
Good sky you've got here, Macintyre.
Well done.

1165
01:35:57,737 --> 01:36:01,283
One or two unfamiliar objects
to look at up there.

1166
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:03,660
I like this place.

1167
01:36:03,744 --> 01:36:05,787
The air is good, clear.

1168
01:36:06,581 --> 01:36:10,918
Get me a telescope...tomorrow.
Two-inch refractor will do.

1169
01:36:11,001 --> 01:36:12,921
You hear that? Tomorrow.

1170
01:36:13,004 --> 01:36:17,717
Ben's got a telescope.
It's bigger than two inches, though.

1171
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,681
Ben's got this whole place sewn up.
Come on, Danny. Carry that stuff.

1172
01:36:25,935 --> 01:36:29,396
I'll offer him the piano,
if he's the problem.

1173
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:32,900
- We've tried most things.
- Did you try a piano?

1174
01:36:34,026 --> 01:36:38,740
No. We offered him $1.5 million.
I don't know if he plays the piano.

1175
01:36:38,823 --> 01:36:40,742
He owns the whole beach?

1176
01:36:40,825 --> 01:36:44,079
It's been in the Knox family
for 400 years.

1177
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:47,708
Knox?

1178
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:49,836
Ben Knox. Sorry, sir, it's his name.

1179
01:36:51,963 --> 01:36:54,966
Maybe I better talk to him.
What's he like?

1180
01:36:56,092 --> 01:36:59,012
He's kind of eccentric,
roams the beach.

1181
01:36:59,095 --> 01:37:01,390
Has an interest in the stars, too.

1182
01:37:02,766 --> 01:37:06,521
In fact,
he has a telescope about this big.

1183
01:37:06,604 --> 01:37:09,690
Knows the sky
like the back of his hand.

1184
01:37:09,774 --> 01:37:11,650
I'll talk to him.

1185
01:37:12,402 --> 01:37:14,946
He has this trick he does with sand.

1186
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:18,450
If he offers you
anything to do with sand,

1187
01:37:18,534 --> 01:37:20,911
say yes, we'll get him to sign.

1188
01:37:20,994 --> 01:37:22,412
Sand?

1189
01:37:22,495 --> 01:37:25,124
Anything up to half a bucket,
say yes.

1190
01:37:25,207 --> 01:37:29,211
- He sells sand?
- No. You'll know if he does it.

1191
01:37:29,294 --> 01:37:32,048
Don't worry about it.
I've got a plan.

1192
01:37:32,131 --> 01:37:34,759
I'll offer him a telescope,
a big one.

1193
01:37:34,842 --> 01:37:36,762
Well, good luck, sir.

1194
01:37:37,596 --> 01:37:40,015
Ben, it's Mac again.

1195
01:37:42,601 --> 01:37:45,062
Ah, good morning to you, Mr Mac.

1196
01:37:45,145 --> 01:37:47,898
This is Mr Happer. He'd like to talk.

1197
01:37:47,981 --> 01:37:50,026
Delighted to meet you, sir.

1198
01:37:52,486 --> 01:37:56,157
Uh...Mr Happer is from America,
like me.

1199
01:37:56,241 --> 01:37:58,117
- America?
- Mm-hm.

1200
01:37:58,201 --> 01:38:01,789
- Well, then, Mr, uh...
- Happer. Happer.

1201
01:38:01,872 --> 01:38:05,250
Happer-Happer?
Come in if you've come that far.

1202
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:06,878
Thank you, sir.

1203
01:38:06,961 --> 01:38:09,463
- Er...
- Oh.

1204
01:38:12,884 --> 01:38:16,346
- That'll be all for now, Macintyre.
- Yes, sir.

1205
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:39,120
See if they're still laughing.

1206
01:39:09,403 --> 01:39:12,824
- What happened?
- Well, they want some whisky.

1207
01:39:12,907 --> 01:39:16,452
Ben wants beef sandwiches
with mustard, no salt.

1208
01:39:16,536 --> 01:39:18,330
Did Happer say anything?

1209
01:39:18,413 --> 01:39:21,249
He doesn't want any mustard,
just salt.

1210
01:39:21,333 --> 01:39:22,709
Nothing else?

1211
01:39:22,792 --> 01:39:25,963
- I asked if they wanted water...
- OK, OK.

1212
01:39:28,465 --> 01:39:30,927
Stay cool, Mac. It's a good sign.

1213
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:32,929
I'll get the food.

1214
01:39:33,012 --> 01:39:36,933
Bring some brandy back with you,
Gordon. I'm dying.

1215
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:28,030
Well, sláinte, everybody.

1216
01:40:28,113 --> 01:40:29,698
Eh? What?

1217
01:40:29,781 --> 01:40:31,534
Sláinte?

1218
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:36,665
- Sköl.
- Cheers.

1219
01:40:44,882 --> 01:40:47,342
Jesus, what's going on in there?

1220
01:40:47,426 --> 01:40:49,595
Sounds like they are buddies.

1221
01:40:52,515 --> 01:40:54,559
Any news about the money?

1222
01:40:54,643 --> 01:40:57,353
Not yet. Here, have another brandy.

1223
01:40:57,437 --> 01:40:59,105
Thanks.

1224
01:40:59,188 --> 01:41:01,233
Hey, look!

1225
01:41:02,192 --> 01:41:04,236
See you tonight.

1226
01:41:25,217 --> 01:41:27,052
Hello, Macintyre.

1227
01:41:27,136 --> 01:41:29,471
- How did it go, sir?
- Oh, fine.

1228
01:41:29,555 --> 01:41:32,266
This place has a lot to offer.

1229
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:36,855
But the refinery site was a mistake.
Ben's been filling me in.

1230
01:41:36,938 --> 01:41:40,567
Ben has eight unplotted objects
in this very sky.

1231
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:42,695
We're doing a scan tonight.

1232
01:41:42,778 --> 01:41:45,781
The acquisition's
at an advanced stage, sir.

1233
01:41:45,864 --> 01:41:48,033
Oh, I want this place, Macintyre.

1234
01:41:48,116 --> 01:41:52,621
But tell Crabbe to start rethinking
the refinery site tomorrow.

1235
01:41:52,705 --> 01:41:58,711
I see a kind of an institute here,
a place for research and study,

1236
01:41:58,795 --> 01:42:00,714
an observatory, so to speak,

1237
01:42:00,798 --> 01:42:03,216
with radio and optical telescopes.

1238
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:06,721
And after a while, we can branch out.

1239
01:42:06,804 --> 01:42:11,225
The sea, sir! This is a natural place
for a marine laboratory.

1240
01:42:11,308 --> 01:42:13,353
We've some data in Aberdeen.

1241
01:42:13,436 --> 01:42:18,900
The North Atlantic Drift fetches up
things here from all over the world.

1242
01:42:18,984 --> 01:42:20,735
Sea and sky.

1243
01:42:20,819 --> 01:42:22,279
I like that.

1244
01:42:22,362 --> 01:42:24,280
We can do good things here.

1245
01:42:24,364 --> 01:42:27,534
You could call it
the Happer Institute, sir.

1246
01:42:28,368 --> 01:42:31,998
You might be right.
Might be just the name for it.

1247
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:35,167
Says it all. Good thinking, uh...

1248
01:42:35,251 --> 01:42:38,546
- Oldsen, sir.
- Oldsen, you stay here with me.

1249
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:41,090
Macintyre, Crabbe will need you.

1250
01:42:41,174 --> 01:42:44,803
Take the chopper to Aberdeen.
Get over to Houston.

1251
01:42:44,887 --> 01:42:49,183
Tell Crabbe to get thinking along the
lines of an offshore establishment,

1252
01:42:49,267 --> 01:42:53,062
but just for storage - and to put
the refinery nearer the models.

1253
01:42:53,145 --> 01:42:55,857
- Tonight, sir?
- The sooner the better.

1254
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:58,610
And Macintyre, get yourself a shave.

1255
01:43:03,657 --> 01:43:08,162
What's this laboratory thing?
You didn't tell me about that.

1256
01:43:08,245 --> 01:43:11,040
Something I've been piecing together.

1257
01:43:11,123 --> 01:43:14,335
Geddes' people are on it.
Remember the girl?

1258
01:43:14,419 --> 01:43:16,504
Oh, yeah, the girl.

1259
01:43:16,587 --> 01:43:19,216
Macintyre. You'd better get moving.

1260
01:43:19,299 --> 01:43:22,427
I'm glad I managed to stop
your refinery caper.

1261
01:43:22,802 --> 01:43:24,847
Oldsen...

1262
01:43:25,931 --> 01:43:27,975
Get my overcoat.

1263
01:43:28,058 --> 01:43:30,102
Prepare some food for later.

1264
01:43:30,185 --> 01:43:33,523
- Ben and I will be on the telescope.
- Yes, Mr Happer.

1265
01:43:33,606 --> 01:43:36,610
Oldsen,
I could grow to love this place.

1266
01:43:42,323 --> 01:43:46,036
You don't have to pay.
I could stick it on the Knox tab.

1267
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:50,374
- It's been fun having you.
- No, I'll pay, I want to.

1268
01:43:51,417 --> 01:43:53,794
Make it out to Stella B Urquhart.

1269
01:43:53,878 --> 01:43:55,839
- Stella?
- She's the boss.

1270
01:43:55,922 --> 01:43:59,425
This is an American account.
It might not be valid.

1271
01:43:59,509 --> 01:44:02,387
We can stick it on the wall
for a souvenir.

1272
01:44:02,471 --> 01:44:06,266
- Hope things work out with Happer.
- We can handle him.

1273
01:44:06,349 --> 01:44:10,354
The big boys always want
the playground to themselves.

1274
01:44:10,437 --> 01:44:14,734
- There'll be work and money.
- Yeah. Work and money.

1275
01:44:14,817 --> 01:44:16,861
It'll be OK.

1276
01:44:17,486 --> 01:44:19,740
Well, so long.

1277
01:44:20,699 --> 01:44:24,577
- You should say goodbye to Stella.
- It doesn't matter.

1278
01:44:24,662 --> 01:44:28,207
- Go and see her, Mac.
- Say toodle-oo for me.

1279
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:31,085
And toodle-oo to you, too.

1280
01:44:36,465 --> 01:44:38,218
I'll see you off.

1281
01:44:54,401 --> 01:44:56,446
Marina!

1282
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,324
Marina?!

1283
01:44:59,782 --> 01:45:04,663
Marina, it's the plans!
The lab...it's going to happen!

1284
01:45:05,163 --> 01:45:07,583
I told them all about it!

1285
01:45:07,666 --> 01:45:11,628
The marine laboratory...
it's going to happen!

1286
01:45:13,715 --> 01:45:15,341
Hey, Mr Mac.

1287
01:45:15,425 --> 01:45:17,802
Hey! Can I...?

1288
01:45:19,096 --> 01:45:21,556
Can I get your autograph, please?

1289
01:45:26,770 --> 01:45:28,814
Ta! Good luck!

1290
01:45:29,773 --> 01:45:32,819
Hold on, Marina!
I want to talk to you.

1291
01:45:48,001 --> 01:45:49,962
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

1292
01:46:16,491 --> 01:46:19,286
Is that the Yank
in that thing, Edward?

1293
01:46:19,369 --> 01:46:21,413
Aye, Peter, that's him.

1294
01:46:21,496 --> 01:46:25,084
Ah, bugger it!
I meant to say cheerio.

1295
01:46:29,421 --> 01:46:33,718
'Scottish one-two-four.
Call approach. Out.'

1296
01:46:33,801 --> 01:46:37,389
Bravo romeo, roger.
QSY one-two-zero decimal four.

1297
01:46:38,305 --> 01:46:44,455
