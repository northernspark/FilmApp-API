2
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,666
Excuse me?
I'm looking for a mechanic.

3
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,332
Is there one here?

4
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,166
Maybe I can help.
What do you need?

5
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,791
It has to be done right away.

6
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,249
You have to know
what you're doing.

7
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,207
I'm not that busy.
What's the matter?

8
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:35,874
I'm not sure.

9
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,916
Maybe you should check it out.

10
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,541
Maybe I bettter.

11
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:52,916
Looks ok from here.

12
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,707
Great customer service.

13
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,374
A little bit of cleaning and paint

14
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:02,957
and it'll be ready for business.

15
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,582
It's time for me to play
in the Super Bowl.

16
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,207
The guys will take you apart.

17
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,791
We're gonna do it this time.

18
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,666
You ready?

19
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:31,999
Turn back!

20
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,582
Here it comes!

21
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,707
Alright!

22
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,832
Suckers walk.

23
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,499
Suckers walk.

24
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,082
What does that mean, Frankie?

25
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,124
It means everything's okay.

26
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,749
How do you think I did?

27
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,999
Pretty good with the six-graders.

28
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,207
You really build me up...

29
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,207
What's the matter?
You don't look too happy today.

30
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,249
I'm missing you already.

31
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:28,082
Soon you'll see me so much that
you'll pray to have some time alone.

32
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,499
- I don't believe you.
- Oh yeah, believe it.

33
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,291
Now that's Italian!

34
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:45,499
- I have to go.
- No, Frank!

35
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:50,707
So I'm not so good against kids?
Should I try a different sport?

36
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,291
Yeah, golf.

37
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,916
Golf?

38
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,707
- Wanna see my swing?
- You in whites...

39
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,541
Like those old guys?

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,957
Can you see me on a golf course?

41
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,874
Good thing I've a sense of humor

42
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,249
or I would take that personally.

43
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,666
Time to go to work
Be good.

44
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:40,874
Wait a minute.

45
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,499
I've got something for you.

46
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,041
What's this?

47
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:48,957
It'll bring you luck.

48
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,249
That's nice.

49
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,666
Thanks.

50
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,999
I could use it.

51
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,666
- How was your time off?
- Great.

52
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,582
Did you see that game?

53
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,291
- I missed it.
- It was awesome.

54
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,416
- Was it really?
- You missed a good one, buddy.

55
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,082
I bet my weekend was better
than yours.

56
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,624
I'll bet it was.

57
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,916
Here you go, Roger.
How's the Diesel running, Jimmy?

58
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:46,457
Forget it. It stops, it stalls.
I don't know what to do with it.

59
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,374
- You got water in the fuel line.
- Open.

60
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,416
Are you sure?

61
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,999
I'd bet time on it.

62
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,707
- Take it off.
- Alright.

63
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,541
See you later, Jimmy.

64
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,457
- You'll get more starch next time.
- Good.

65
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:04,499
Say hi to the wife.

66
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,916
How are you?

67
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,166
Frank! What did you bring me?

68
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,499
Here. Kill yourself!

69
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:12,999
What about the girl?

70
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,624
I had one for you but the guards
liked her so much they kept her.

71
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,457
I knew it. I can't depend on you.

72
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:24,582
- Did you check out the garage?
- It's beautiful.

73
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,082
Beautiful? No garage is beautiful.

74
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,707
This one is. It's great.

75
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,499
Can I tell you something?
I'm getting out soon.

76
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,957
I don't come cheap,

77
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,582
but I know my way around cars.
If you need help, call me.

78
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,374
I fix them, I don't steal them.

79
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,666
I was framed.

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,374
What? I was framed.

81
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,874
What's going on?

82
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,416
I don't know but it's official.

83
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,791
Open up cell 210.

84
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,666
On your feet, Leone.

85
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,416
- What do you want?
- Take him.

86
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,374
You're being transferred.

87
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,624
Where? What the hell...

88
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,916
- That's not necessary.
- Step back, officer.

89
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,666
He's in our custody now.

90
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,249
You've got the wrong guy.

91
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,457
Transferred where?

92
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,957
- Move it.
- What did I do?

93
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,541
Open up! Get in!

94
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,624
What have I done? Damn!

95
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,249
Where are we going?

96
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,707
Talk to me.

97
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,499
Let's go, Leone.

98
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,374
Get his ass out here.

99
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,707
Come on, get out.

100
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,332
- Where are we?
- Shut up.

101
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,666
You made a mistake.

102
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,166
There's no mistake.

103
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,541
Welcome to Gateway.

104
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,041
- Drumgoole?
- Warden Drumgoole!

105
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,166
- Captain?
- Move him.

106
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:05,749
One bar of soap and two rolls
of toilet paper a month.

107
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,499
- If somebody steals them...
- Move!

108
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:13,374
If you lose them, you'll wipe
your ass with your shirt.

109
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,707
You have one uniform.

110
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:18,082
Your number is 510. Remember it!

111
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:23,874
This is C Wing. You will eat,
shower and take yard time here.

112
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,249
Miss a count: you're in the hole.

113
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:30,291
Miss two:
I'll put you in the house of pain.

114
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,249
Convict. Two things.

115
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,624
One: I am Meissner.

116
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,249
Two:
Never fuck with Meissner.

117
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,874
Inside.

118
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:54,082
- What about the cuffs?
- Let him get used to them.

119
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,582
Officer Fryberg, contact 5235.

120
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:01,832
521.

121
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,749
521. Open it.

122
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:21,249
You better not eyeball me, boy.

123
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:24,624
How were the accommodations
last night?

124
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,957
Like your mama used to do you?

125
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,916
- You did his mama, didn't you?
- Twice.

126
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,749
Open the door! You hear me?

127
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,874
Hello, Frank.

128
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:08,874
In the old days the warden
would come from his office,

129
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:14,291
to this chamber and witness
the putting to death of a criminal.

130
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,166
120 men and four women
were electrocuted in that chair.

131
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,832
Beautiful, isn't it?

132
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,291
When I came to Gateway, I had it
put back into perfect working order

133
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,832
to remind me
of how things ought to be.

134
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,832
It's been five years since
you escaped.

135
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,666
Yes, how time flies.

136
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,957
In all the years that I was warden,
you're the only one that made it.

137
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,291
That's what I read in the papers.

138
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,916
Of course you did.

139
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,624
You and your lawyers

140
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,457
did everything to make the news,

141
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,832
the media.

142
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,416
Distorting the truth,

143
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,082
making a criminal into a hero
and the warden into a criminal.

144
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,124
You took my future away from me.

145
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:05,207
Those bleeding heart politicians
politicians sent you to Norwood.

146
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,291
I ended up here in Gateway,
the worst shit-hole in the system.

147
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:15,624
I begged you, Drumgoole.
Do you remember that?

148
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:20,041
I had two weeks to go
and all I asked for was one hour

149
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,999
to visit a dying old man.

150
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,749
I was only doing my job.

151
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,957
There's a lot of ways to do it.

152
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,582
You could have given me
and escorted leave.

153
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,166
- You could've done that.
- You broke the law.

154
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,999
You broke the law
and I was punished.

155
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,374
I got five years. I paid my debt!

156
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,166
To the state, not to me.
But you're going to.

157
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:44,416
I only have six months left.

158
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,124
That's a lifetime here.
Anything can happen.

159
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:52,707
This is hard time. You have
no rights unless I give them to you.

160
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,374
You feel no pleasure
unless I allow it. This is hell.

161
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,332
And I'll give you the guided tour.

162
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,124
Ok, tough guy,

163
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,624
open your mouth.

164
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,749
Roll your tongue.
Are you trying to kiss me?

165
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,999
Show me you ears.

166
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,624
What are you looking at, asshole?

167
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,499
- Did you check his nose?
- Yes.

168
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,624
Good.

169
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,332
This is a delousing chamber.

170
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:36,666
Don't breathe.

171
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,874
The gas can be harmful
to your lungs.

172
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:44,082
Stand with you legs apart,
arms extended away from your body.

173
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:48,624
When I tell you, take a deep breath
and hold it for 30 seconds.

174
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:49,957
Start now.

175
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,416
Ten seconds.

176
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,749
Not yet.

177
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,791
He can take more.

178
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,582
Mr. Braden,

179
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,541
inmates are physically more capable

180
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,916
than you can imagine.

181
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:01,791
If you underestimate them,
it'll cost you dearly.

182
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,624
Watch out for the birds.
What are you doing?

183
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:54,166
I'm sorry.

184
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,499
Billy, get that weight.

185
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,166
Move it, ace.

186
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,416
That's my spot.

187
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:45,124
That's my spot too.

188
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,999
- Any spot here that isn't yours?
- No.

189
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,499
There're all mine.

190
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,457
If you want one, you gotta pay.

191
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,249
Not so fast, ace.
I'm not gonna gouge you,

192
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:04,416
That thing around your neck
will buy a spot

193
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,916
for the day.

194
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,166
I'll put a hole in your heart.

195
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,416
Break it up!

196
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,374
Break it up, I said!

197
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,249
Back off!

198
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,707
Drop the weapon.

199
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,499
There's no shank here.

200
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,624
- Come on.
- Mother fucker.

201
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,916
Spread your legs.

202
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,874
You're making a big mistake.

203
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,791
You'll go in the hole for that.

204
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,457
Where's your witness?
Where's your evidence?

205
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,374
- He saw it.
- He didn't see anything.

206
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,999
He saw the shank, right?

207
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,457
I didn't see anything.

208
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:49,291
You're making a bad mistake, Braden.

209
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,332
Get him the fuck out.

210
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:00,624
He would have put
that shank in you.

211
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,499
Why are you covering him?

212
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,749
You have your rules
and we have ours.

213
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:28,124
I know the face,
and I know the name. Hey, Frank.

214
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:29,749
Frank Leone, right.

215
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:33,916
My name's Dallas. I was in
Treadmore, when you busted out.

216
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,207
You were in A Block.

217
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,791
Right, I was in A Block.
You have a good memory, man.

218
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,207
Treadmore doesn't have an A Block.
Watch your feet.

219
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,041
I was there on transfer.

220
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,041
Less than two hours,
but I know all about you.

221
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,124
You're looking at a devoted fan.

222
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,582
D.T.A.

223
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:02,957
D.T.A. Ok.
What's that, man?

224
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:08,082
Don't trust anybody.
Words to survive by. Your feet.

225
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,166
D.T.A.?

226
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,249
D.T.A.

227
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,582
You've got to trust someone.

228
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,374
I'll make it clear.
See this fat tub of shit back here?

229
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:18,999
That's Manly.

230
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,207
His partner's and Wiley.
They're sadistic pigs.

231
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:25,624
They are only happy
when they are hurting someone.

232
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:30,166
If the warden wants you down,
he uses them.

233
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:32,541
And the black dude in the booth

234
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,749
is Captain Meissner.

235
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,332
He runs the guards.
He's one bad dude, ok?

236
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,582
We already met.
I've got to work, move you feet.

237
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,249
Listen Frank.

238
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,999
When you decide
to make your break,

239
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:52,832
and I know you will,

240
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:56,957
you come and talk to me, ok?
You come talk to Dallas.

241
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:02,624
Anything you want or need,
I can get. Ok?

242
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,166
- No damn way.
- Come on, Eclipse.

243
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:11,791
You're always crying about needing a
man who knows his engines, Holmes.

244
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:17,082
Don't Holmes me. The only thing
you brought here is trouble.

245
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,582
Come on, Eclipse.

246
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:23,666
I know all about you. Your thing
with Drumgoole won't come in here.

247
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:29,166
The boys have no problems with me
and I have no problems with them.

248
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,707
Don't make me look bad.
I promised him a job, you owe me.

249
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:43,957
I don't owe you
or anybody anything. Hey, you!

250
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:45,916
Get your face out of that motor.

251
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:50,082
Get your face out of there.
You know nothing about motors.

252
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,457
Get away form it, ok?

253
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,541
It's been a long time
since I last saw a 365 motor block.

254
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,332
Take a good look. That's the
last time you'll see one here.

255
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,416
Frank, we can work this out,
we're all gentlemen here.

256
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,874
That's alright, it's his place.
He knows what he wants.

257
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,124
Thanks a lot,
I appreciate the endorsement.

258
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,749
Hold on.

259
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:24,041
You don't want this job anyway,
greasy fingers and oily clothes.

260
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,541
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

261
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,541
That's what I'm afraid of.

262
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:36,457
Prison joke: I lost my watch.
will you help me find it?

263
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,832
Get your ass out of here.

264
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:43,207
You should put on a few pounds.
You look a little frail.

265
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,249
I meant what I said.
I'll get you something good.

266
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:52,291
Something easy, something cool.

267
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,749
Shut up and get inside.

268
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,082
Here's your shit from Norwood,
Leone.

269
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,582
Lock in!

270
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:24,207
Problem?

271
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,624
No, I have no problems.

272
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,082
- What the hell is going on?
- Look Miss,

273
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:40,374
he's here with 2000 other inmates...

274
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:43,041
I don't give a damn about the rest!

275
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,124
I want to know
about Leone and I...

276
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:46,624
Calm down, Miss.

277
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,457
Leone is alright.

278
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:52,082
He was a model prisoner.
Why did you bring him here?

279
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,916
Routine transfer.

280
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:10,916
It's hot in here.

281
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,582
I know. But at least it's easy.

282
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,332
I know, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't do too well.

283
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,124
Walk with me, I have to show you
something. It's important.

284
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,916
- No, here, you try.
- No, come on.

285
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,124
- You'll like it.
- I'm not into hard labor.

286
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:28,957
It's cool, it's easy.

287
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,082
I'm burnt out. Come on, man.

288
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,124
You're gonna love this.

289
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:37,749
Watch the steam, Frank.

290
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:48,041
I got these off an old trustee
plumber. They said he was a nut.

291
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,082
That doesn't mean he wasn't smart.

292
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:53,416
- Hurry up.
- Alright.

293
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:58,166
There are tunnels
under every cell block.

294
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,124
They lead to the steam plant.

295
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:02,832
I go out across the steam lines.

296
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,749
I'll shimmy across the steam pipes

297
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,874
to the sally port.

298
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:12,374
There are trucks coming and going.
I wait for my time...

299
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:16,999
and I am on a truck that's leaving.
I'm dearly departing Dallas.

300
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,582
Am I keeping you awake?
You're the doctor,

301
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,124
I want your opinion.

302
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,791
Let's run it backwards.

303
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:29,124
I see these trucks,
they stop running at about 9.

304
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:34,207
At 9 most of the guards complete
and all the inmates are awake.

305
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,624
So before you go ten feet,
every con here will know it.

306
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,999
And this... shimmy?

307
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,166
Shimmy slide.

308
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:48,582
You're going to shimmy slide across
200 yards of steam pipe at 150(?

309
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,999
Departing Dallas
will become Deep Fried Dallas.

310
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:01,249
- It was just a thought.
- That's what counts.

311
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,082
I've got a plane to catch.
Thanks a lot.

312
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,291
Dallas?

313
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,416
You got a cigarette?

314
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:13,332
This is my last one.
Here, finish that.

315
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,374
It's not much,
but it's the thought that counts.

316
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:41,499
Last call for the mess hall!

317
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:47,041
Looks like garbage stew,

318
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,916
like mom used to make.
That's why I shot her.

319
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:55,499
- Can I have some more gravy?
- Gravy?

320
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,291
You want some gravy?

321
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:01,332
- Here's some gravy.
- It's all over my food.

322
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,499
Move it!

323
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,707
- What's he in for?
- Murder.

324
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:11,082
He was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

325
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:16,166
He waited in the car while his
buddy went for beer. Boom boom!

326
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,999
Two guys dead.
The kid's doing the big bitch now.

327
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,541
Double life.

328
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,749
He'll make parole
when he's about 400.

329
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,457
Move it!

330
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,291
Are you a slow study or what?

331
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,249
Forget it.

332
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,499
I didn't get a chance to reserve.

333
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,666
Why don't we sit over there.

334
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,332
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking this.

335
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,832
- Go take something else.
- Are you looking for trouble?

336
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,249
- Want some cake?
- Something wrong?

337
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:50,916
I'm not hungry.

338
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,207
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

339
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,457
I'm on a diet.

340
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,207
Is this spot taken?

341
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,457
You should've hit that fat dirt bag.

342
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,082
Shut up. He just saved you.

343
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,874
What's your name?

344
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:10,082
Why does anybody need a name
in a joint like this?

345
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,249
It helps when you get mail.

346
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,707
I need a name?

347
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,541
They call me Killer.

348
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:20,916
That's original.
Did you think that up yourself?

349
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,582
I call myself what I want, ok?

350
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,457
Killer, this is Dallas
and I'm Frank.

351
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:31,041
What are these supposed to be?

352
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:35,416
These might be peas or
they might be toxic waste

353
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,666
Who cares? It's all crap, anyway.

354
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,916
Eat your vegetables,

355
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:42,374
- you'll grow big and strong.
- Stick your vegetables.

356
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,124
You know there are about
325 other "Killers" in here.

357
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,624
Put your leg in the aisle.

358
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,416
Be ready to move.

359
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,041
Nobody tells me what to do.

360
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:25,749
You have to be ready to move first.
You have time to get to first base.

361
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,541
"First Base",

362
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,541
there's a name for him.

363
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,582
It's good to be outside.

364
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:43,749
It's cold outside.

365
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:46,916
It's not that bad.
It's good keep moving.

366
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:52,124
How can you keep that "up" attitude
in a joint like this?

367
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:53,332
It's a mind set.

368
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:56,874
Your body has to be in here
but your brain doesn't.

369
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,291
Keep moving and you won't become
a piece of this place.

370
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,916
Is that guru stuff?

371
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:06,041
- Maybe I should become a guru.
- Is that sarcasm?

372
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,291
Fucking birds.

373
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,624
They don't eat in the rain.

374
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,791
They'll come back.

375
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:20,582
Will you save your bread for me
tomorrow?

376
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:23,416
Sure. Put that on your list.

377
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,291
Thanks.

378
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:29,541
Why do you talk to crazy?
It's a waste of time.

379
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,499
To you it's a waste of time.
To him it's all he's got.

380
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,791
In here you have
to respect something.

381
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,374
You have to protect what you have.

382
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:44,166
You don't know anything yet.
Come on, let's run.

383
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,999
I'm gonna get wet.

384
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,957
I'll send you laundry bill.

385
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,082
Did you feel something, Leone?

386
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:14,582
Do you want to play?
We're a man short.

387
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,416
I'm talking to you!

388
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:30,874
Hey punk. Go paint your nails
and answer to "bitch"!

389
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,666
You've got a big mouth. Shut it!

390
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,874
You mother fucker! I'll tear your...

391
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,916
You want to play? We'll play.

392
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:44,457
You talk too much. Let's play.

393
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:46,041
Goddamn right we'll play.

394
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,666
You and I will play later.

395
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,666
Give it to him!

396
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:06,249
You want more?
We have more for you.

397
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:12,749
Stay there!

398
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,416
That's a cheap shot!

399
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,957
This isn't a game, man.

400
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,832
This is a lesson.

401
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:47,332
- Do you have something to say?
- First down!

402
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,582
Fuck you, that's your last one.
You're dead, Leone.

403
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,499
You won't last the game!

404
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,332
Get in there!

405
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,666
Hut one, hut two,

406
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,999
hut three.

407
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,332
Don't mix it with us.

408
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,082
Finish him off.

409
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,749
Go over there. That's who
you're playing for anyway.

410
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,874
What took you so long?

411
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:42,624
You need the help
and I the exercise.

412
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,332
So, call a play.

413
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:48,541
You're dead!

414
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:04,582
What was that?

415
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:06,666
The F train, son.

416
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:20,791
Don't lay down on me.

417
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,541
Come on.

418
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:29,124
Come on, Leone.
You son of a bitch!

419
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,374
Over the tackle on "two".

420
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:39,957
Set!

421
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,332
You're dead!

422
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:42,499
Hut one.

423
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:45,791
Two.

424
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,082
Let me through.

425
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,624
Next time I want something,

426
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,582
you give it to me.

427
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:02,499
Move it, the game's over.

428
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,207
You don't listen, do you?

429
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,249
Are you ok? Come on.

430
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:11,166
Put him down.
You're not a doctor.

431
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:14,457
He's on his own.
Get inside.

432
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:21,749
You're a badass, huh?

433
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,666
See you inside, Leone.

434
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,582
You won't break me.

435
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,041
Still interested in the job?

436
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,541
Yes, I am.

437
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:23,374
You know you way
around an engine.

438
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:24,707
Who taught you?

439
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,166
An old man named Galleti.

440
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:31,332
Took me off the streets
when I was 14

441
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,582
and kept me off the street corners.

442
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,457
- Where is everybody?
- It's quitting time.

443
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,874
We've got the place to ourselves.
Did you break out for him?

444
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:42,541
Yes, I owed him.

445
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,332
What put you in the joint?

446
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,916
One night these punks broke into
the garage and beat up Galleti.

447
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:54,416
The whole neighborhood
knew about it. So did the cops.

448
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:57,791
The punks were connected
so the cops didn't do anything.

449
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:59,416
And I did.

450
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:04,874
These guys ended up in hospital
and I did 18 in Treadmore

451
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,374
for aggravated assault.

452
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,374
A little contraband?

453
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,832
Why not?

454
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:16,332
I see why they call you Eclipse.
You're... 6'7?

455
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,666
I block a lot of the sun, don't I?

456
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,124
Yeah, you do.

457
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:23,166
I had a guy who used to get me
good Havanas.

458
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:27,041
Not this crap.
But someday...

459
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,666
- Someday...
- Someday.

460
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,166
- That's not bad.
- At least they're cheap.

461
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,082
What are you hiding back there?

462
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,541
That's my baby.

463
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,499
Good body work.

464
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,832
- This is Mabeline.
- Hello Mabeline.

465
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:53,624
This is my baby.

466
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:57,624
Come on.

467
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:01,041
1965 Ford Mustang, 8 cylinder.

468
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:05,791
225 horse power.
When did you last turn it over?

469
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,707
She's been dead for fifteen years.
Nobody could bring her back to life.

470
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,374
I'm a body man myself.

471
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,582
Mind if I give it a try?

472
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,374
It's a dead issue, Frank.

473
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,416
Nothing's dead around here
until it's buried.

474
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,957
Save the headstone.

475
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:07,874
Nothing is dead until it's buried.

476
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,041
Purrs like a kitten!

477
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,999
A toast. Let's do the poem.

478
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:21,457
- What poem?
- The poem, man.

479
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:22,957
The jailhouse poem.

480
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,874
- We wrote it ourselves.
- Excuse me.

481
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:31,457
When we're in a sober mood
We worry, work and think

482
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,749
When we're in a drunken mood

483
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,249
We gamble, play and drink

484
00:46:36,417 --> 00:46:38,166
But when our moods are over,

485
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,916
When our time has come to pas

486
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,707
We hope they bury us upside down

487
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:45,582
So that the warden can kiss our ass!

488
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,457
I like that.

489
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,082
It's catchy.

490
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:55,457
This is the best.
This is good, man.

491
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,249
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

492
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:05,082
I wouldn't smoke around it but
it's as good as any dollar around.

493
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:06,916
Check, please.

494
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,916
When my moods are over
and my...

495
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,374
That's not it.

496
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,291
Are you married
or thinking about it?

497
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:23,999
Are you proposing to me?
I'm not married.

498
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:27,166
Will you when you get out?

499
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,999
That's the plan.

500
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:35,041
You know,
I had this really nice girl.

501
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:38,874
She was nice. And we were in love.

502
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:42,457
We started talking about
gettting married.

503
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:46,624
She has three brothers,
one percent retarded.

504
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:49,166
They were being on me.

505
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:51,916
Some guys don't appreciate romance.

506
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,166
Don't take it personally.

507
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:56,791
She wrote me for a while.

508
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,999
Then it just stopped.
That's when it hit me:

509
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:04,832
I'm never going to be with
a girl again. Or even see one.

510
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:08,624
I'll end up like Eclipse
kissing pictures in magazines.

511
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:12,582
There are so many things
I've never done.

512
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,957
I didn't learn how to drive.

513
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:16,499
What?

514
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:19,041
I never learned to drive.

515
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,374
I hope we don't get
a speeding ticket,

516
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:26,457
I'd hate to end up in jail.

517
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:31,291
Look wise guy, do you want
to learn to drive or not?

518
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:34,666
Cut it sharp.

519
00:48:34,917 --> 00:48:36,541
That's it.

520
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,541
Now, left into 42nd Street.

521
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,874
We'll go to Broadway

522
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:44,999
- and check out the action.
- What Broadway? We're in a garage.

523
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:48,166
Come on. Work with me.

524
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:50,957
You wanna stay here
or check out the action?

525
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:53,374
I want to check out the action.

526
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,374
- Then left on 42nd Street.
- Okay, I got it.

527
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:02,249
The place is jumping.
Look at the action here!

528
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,374
Check out
those fine-looking ladies!

529
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,749
Hey honey, want a ride?

530
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:07,916
Hey baby.

531
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,666
- No reaction.
- They're not your type.

532
00:49:11,292 --> 00:49:14,374
- When were you in Atlantic City?
- I've never been.

533
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:19,249
- What do you think of it?
- Do I like it?

534
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,249
It's the best. The lights...

535
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,707
The broadwalk is always jumping,
day and night.

536
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:28,791
There's hot music.
High rollers, parties.

537
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:30,166
You've got money,

538
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,624
you gamble.

539
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:33,624
10,000 chorus girls!

540
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:37,082
Hey honey, feel like a ride
in my new vehicle?

541
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,666
That was great.

542
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:44,541
You're ready for Indianapolis?

543
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,291
You got the touch.

544
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,041
Would you do me a favor?

545
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:52,374
Everything was great,

546
00:49:53,042 --> 00:49:55,957
but I would like to hear the engine.

547
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:59,749
If we start the engine
the guards will come in

548
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:02,416
and we'll all land up in the hole.

549
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,874
Forget it.

550
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,582
Just for ten seconds.

551
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,999
It will last the rest of my life.

552
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,707
You are a pain in the ass.

553
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:14,124
Please let me hear that engine.

554
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,249
We built it, man.

555
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,791
Go on. 10 seconds.

556
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,332
Looking good.

557
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:32,416
It's beautiful, baby.

558
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:33,624
Hit it one time.

559
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:35,666
One more time!

560
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,374
Damn it. Frank!

561
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,041
Kill it, Frank, come on.

562
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:41,999
You did it. Turn it off.

563
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,624
Kill it, Frank.

564
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:47,541
Come on First, turn it off!

565
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:52,332
If I turn it off,
I'll never turn it on again, right?

566
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,374
That's right.

567
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:57,624
Turn it off, First.

568
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,874
I'm sorry, Frank.

569
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,791
Get him out of the car!

570
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,082
Stop him!

571
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,332
Stop that kid!

572
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:36,457
First! Stop, you crazy bastard!

573
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:42,291
Stop that car!

574
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,791
I repeat: Stop that car.

575
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:52,874
They'll kill you!

576
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,874
This is Meissner. Stop firing.

577
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,166
The warden said...

578
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:03,874
I said stop firing!

579
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,541
First, turn it off!

580
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:10,707
Hold it!

581
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,582
Look out Frank, be careful!

582
00:52:15,792 --> 00:52:18,749
Get out of the car.

583
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:22,791
- They'll kill you.
- Did you see that Frank?

584
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:24,791
- Are you crazy?
- It was beautiful!

585
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,374
I can drive!

586
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,416
I can drive a car!

587
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,416
You're a crazy son-of-a-bitch.

588
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,624
Out of the way. Clear the car!

589
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:40,332
You just got yourself
a trip to the hole.

590
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:43,291
Leave Frank alone!

591
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,874
- Out of the way.
- Move back!

592
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,416
Let him go.
You have the wrong man.

593
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,874
Take Leone to the hole. Six weeks.

594
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:57,916
It wasn't his fault!

595
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:58,791
Save it.

596
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:07,957
I want five inmates.
Give me a bat.

597
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:10,166
I want to break up this car.

598
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,791
Hold him right there!

599
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,332
I want you to watch this, Leone.

600
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:28,249
To the honeymoon suite!

601
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:35,957
Good night.

602
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:43,416
- You should have been notified.
- Why is he in isolation?

603
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:44,582
I can't tell you.

604
00:54:44,917 --> 00:54:48,457
Then I want to see the warden!

605
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,332
Not today.

606
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:56,791
When the light comes on, stand up
and state you name and number.

607
00:54:57,792 --> 00:54:58,957
Name and number!

608
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,457
Leone, 510.

609
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:03,291
Face the camera.

610
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,291
Name and number.

611
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:09,082
Leone, 510.

612
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:22,457
Name and number.

613
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,624
Leone, 510.

614
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:35,041
Name and number.

615
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:43,791
Leone, 510.

616
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:52,957
On your feet. Name and number.

617
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:58,874
Give Mr. Leone half rations
for the rest of his time here.

618
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:01,791
Name and number.

619
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:12,332
Get up!

620
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:14,874
He seems a little sluggish.

621
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,999
Wake him up.

622
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:26,624
Cold enough?

623
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:41,666
- Wanna see my swing?
- You in whites...

624
00:56:41,875 --> 00:56:42,749
Like this?

625
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:48,874
Can you see me on a golf course?

626
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,749
Leone, 510.

627
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:57,666
Upright. Name and number.

628
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,207
Leone, 510.

629
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,582
You'll pray to have some time alone.

630
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,749
I don't think so.

631
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,999
Trust me, I know about these things.

632
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,041
Leone, 510.

633
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:20,166
I need water.

634
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:29,666
Leone, 510.

635
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:36,749
Name and number.

636
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,457
Marilyn Monroe.

637
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:42,916
37... something.

638
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:45,416
35.

639
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:56,832
Open cell 121.

640
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:05,249
Hey, I didn't mean it!
I didn't say anything!

641
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:19,999
That's enough.

642
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:38,749
- Who ordered this?
- The warden.

643
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:43,832
Does he hate him enough
to kill him? That's not my job.

644
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,291
Mr. Sensitive.

645
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:47,916
He thinks we're too rough
with Leone.

646
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:51,499
Did you forget who the cops
and the cons are?

647
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:53,166
Be careful!

648
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:55,582
Stop it!

649
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,082
Your stick, Mr. Braden.

650
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,124
Pussy.

651
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,374
You get the hell out of my sight,

652
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:18,249
before I shine my boots with
your face, you fat piece of shit!

653
00:59:30,792 --> 00:59:31,666
Your time's up.

654
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,957
Remember what I told you.

655
00:59:56,375 --> 01:00:00,416
Roll with the system
or it's only going to get harder.

656
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:07,916
And it's gettting shorter too.

657
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:27,999
What's new, Mr. Braden?

658
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,582
How's the family?

659
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,207
How are the Jets?

660
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,082
Don't forget to check your bed.

661
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:38,749
Hey, Frank.

662
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:42,041
Did somebody die in here?

663
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:45,916
Not a nice welcome home, is it?

664
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:02,707
The engine block is full of sand.

665
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:04,124
That was Chink.

666
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,999
What are we going to do?

667
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,374
Forget it.

668
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:12,666
We put all we have into this car.

669
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:15,166
We can't let Chink slide.

670
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:16,624
Let it go, First Base.

671
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:21,707
Aren't you the guy who says
you have to protect what's yours?

672
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:25,541
You watch my back
and I'll watch yours?

673
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:29,999
I guess that was just jive
now that you're a short-timer.

674
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,791
You're incredible.

675
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:36,041
Did you think that is your car?

676
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,374
This is the warden's car.

677
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:41,374
Do you think Chink Weber did this?

678
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,791
Drumgoole did this.

679
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,249
Did you think that

680
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:50,291
we would take our dates out with it?

681
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:51,749
Rotate it on weekends?

682
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:54,416
Ernie, you take it on Friday, Dallas

683
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,416
on Saturday. And Eclipse,

684
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:59,916
you got it Sunday.
Is that what you thought?

685
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:04,832
It's his! This lift, the tools
the whole garage is his!

686
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,457
The whole goddamn place is his!

687
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:15,041
Remember that. Once you start
buying into the "our car" concept,

688
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,707
you're his too.

689
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,082
Just let it go.

690
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:31,291
I thought you were our leader.

691
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:33,624
I'm not your leader!

692
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:37,082
This isn't a gang!
We are convicts,

693
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:38,874
we're prisoners, we're inmates.

694
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:42,374
As long as we're here,
we'll stay his.

695
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:44,624
We're his.

696
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,791
Nothing will change that.

697
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:50,666
You've got to face the facts.

698
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:54,457
You guys will stay,
no doubt about it.

699
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,457
But I got 3 weeks
to get out of here.

700
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,457
In 3 weeks I'm walking.

701
01:04:00,667 --> 01:04:03,082
Nothing will change that.

702
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,832
That's all I care about.

703
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:19,374
Nothing for nothing, man.

704
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,916
He's right.

705
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:36,374
Leone,
how do you like my belt buckle?

706
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:38,582
I like it too.

707
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,291
A little souvenir of you.

708
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:45,457
What are you going to do about it?

709
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:55,374
You mean six weeks in the hole
killed your guts and your appetite?

710
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:01,416
It ain't over, you son-of-a-bitch.

711
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:16,332
Anyone call this spot?

712
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:19,166
You guys made a reservation.

713
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,291
Are you on a diet?

714
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:22,999
Cutting back a little.

715
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,707
Here, take some of mine.

716
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:29,457
Here's some bread.

717
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,624
- Thanks.
- Tomatoes, celery.

718
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:34,457
I'm not playing football.

719
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:37,416
Don't worry about that guy.

720
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:40,624
He's in for life.
You only have a few weeks to go.

721
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:44,749
It's a miracle, First Base
finally learned something.

722
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:49,957
- Who's gonna say grace?
- Grace.

723
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:52,374
She was terrific wasn't she?

724
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:56,082
I wanted to rely on you, Weber.

725
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,832
He won't be pushed.

726
01:05:58,042 --> 01:06:00,832
Because you're not pushing
in the right place.

727
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,791
Everyone has a weak spot.

728
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,041
Find his

729
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,082
or I'll have to find
a new yard boss.

730
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:14,541
Welcome to the Gateway races!

731
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:17,457
Let's start the race.

732
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:18,957
What's your bug's name?

733
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:20,291
Dirt Creature.

734
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,124
Three to two on it.

735
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,124
- What's yours called?
- Rear Entry.

736
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:26,416
Place your bets.

737
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:29,082
Two will get you three
and five, four.

738
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:35,916
Everything I got on Dirt Creature.

739
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,416
The house on Rear Entry.

740
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:42,332
All bets are in.
Gentlemen, start your insects.

741
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,374
I need a win.

742
01:06:58,292 --> 01:06:59,499
You can't do that.

743
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:01,207
The stewards have to decide.

744
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,041
You can't push your bug.

745
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,291
Victory by rear end.

746
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:08,374
We're gonna rerun the race.

747
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:11,207
- What are you doing down there?
- Shit.

748
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:16,124
Penja, you're on the wrong detail.

749
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:18,124
Get your ass up here.

750
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,541
Clean up the gym.

751
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,332
We've got to rematch race later.

752
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,666
I'm getting out of here.
All bets are off.

753
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,124
Now, asshole!

754
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:31,374
Give me a break.
I have to put my jacket on.

755
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,791
Watch my bug.

756
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,166
I'll take care of it for you.
Delicious.

757
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,749
Do it today.

758
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:02,832
- Clean this place up.
- It's already clean.

759
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,291
- Are you deaf?
- Shut you mouth and do it.

760
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,124
Come on, one by one.

761
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:14,624
Get him down. Hold his head.

762
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,416
I told you we'd play later.

763
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:38,416
- They got First!
- I can't hear you!

764
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:44,749
- What's up?
- They got First Base in the gym.

765
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:49,332
- Again.
- They got First Base in the gym.

766
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,332
First!

767
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,332
Let me have it.

768
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,832
20 years old.

769
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:42,457
The kid's 20 years old.
I told you.

770
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:46,207
I know.

771
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,999
You want me, you got me.

772
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:02,832
You want me, you fucking Nazi.

773
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,707
You got me.

774
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:35,791
No.

775
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:43,624
I'll kill you!

776
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:46,166
Fight!

777
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,041
Get him!

778
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:35,957
I'll kill you!

779
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:39,916
You son-of-a-bitch!

780
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,291
I'll kill you!

781
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:02,874
Finish him off!

782
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:23,291
Do it!

783
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,749
Pussy face!

784
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,541
Go on! Drop it!

785
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:16,707
Linen run.

786
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:20,499
Get a move on,
I'm trying to make a living.

787
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:26,791
Florence Nightingale.

788
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:28,874
How are you?

789
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,374
Alright.

790
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:34,332
- You're out in three weeks.
- Seems like three years.

791
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,082
Three weeks is a blink!

792
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,416
What did they do with the kid?

793
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,124
They sent him home.

794
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:54,832
The kid told me once:

795
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:57,249
Your body has to be in prison

796
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,541
but your mind can be
wherever it wants.

797
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,916
He told you that?

798
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:06,291
Yeah.

799
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:10,624
I brought you some toilet paper

800
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:15,249
in case you want to write
some poetry or something.

801
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:19,874
Colonel Klink.
Let me out of here.

802
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:27,791
It wasn't your fault, ok?

803
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,082
Remember that.

804
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:44,166
Roberta, have Ms. Lowell
photograph for an ID.

805
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:47,207
I'm reinstating
Mr. Leone's privileges.

806
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:50,666
I want to make sure
Frank is alright.

807
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,999
He's recovering nicely.

808
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:57,916
In 3 weeks he'll be out of here and
you'll have a happy life together.

809
01:16:58,083 --> 01:16:59,457
Thanks for coming.

810
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:00,874
Thank you, Warden.

811
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:08,957
Look into the light.

812
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,249
Hi, baby.

813
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:20,582
Hi.

814
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:23,832
How are you?

815
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,957
- I was worried.
- You look great.

816
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:30,791
30 minute visit.
Compliments of the warden.

817
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,291
- Don't waste it.
- How do you feel?

818
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,416
Pretty good, thanks, sweetheart.

819
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,041
30 minutes.

820
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,374
If you need any help,
give us a call.

821
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:49,291
- Are they all like that?
- Forget it. You look great.

822
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,332
Don't tell me what I look like.

823
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:56,416
I missed you so much.

824
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:08,957
No more separations. Promise?

825
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,332
Promise.

826
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,291
- Time is up.
- Nice...

827
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,249
What wrong with you?

828
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:34,624
Time's up.

829
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:36,582
The warden said half an hour.

830
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:38,124
The warden changed his mind.

831
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:42,124
What do you mean?
I want to talk to the warden.

832
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:44,957
You want is to do
is keep your mouth shut,

833
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,124
fix your clothes and get out.

834
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:48,582
Come on.

835
01:18:48,792 --> 01:18:49,916
Don't touch her.

836
01:18:50,542 --> 01:18:51,582
What did you say?

837
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:52,916
Don't touch her?

838
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,416
You don't learn!

839
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:56,874
I'm leaving.

840
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:04,374
Three weeks.

841
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,791
Come here.

842
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,582
Do I know you?

843
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,957
No, but I know you.

844
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:49,707
I was at Treadmore.

845
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:53,874
A Block?

846
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,707
Treadmore doesn't have an A Block.

847
01:19:58,083 --> 01:19:59,249
That's right.

848
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:02,124
- We have something in common.
- What's that?

849
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:05,207
We're both getting out soon.

850
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:08,666
You in a few weeks,
and me the day after tomorrow.

851
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:11,874
What happened?

852
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,374
One beating too many.

853
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,374
I've had a hard time here.
We both have, haven't we?

854
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:25,666
You're right about that.

855
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:28,541
Can I get you anything
when I get out?

856
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:31,957
No, I'm alright.

857
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:34,416
I'm just a lucky, I guess.

858
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:40,624
I have a job lined up.
It pays a grand for two hours' work.

859
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:42,457
Not bad, eh?

860
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:44,457
What do you have to do?

861
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:51,832
Rape this bitch.
I get an extra100

862
01:20:52,042 --> 01:20:52,957
for each scream.

863
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:54,207
I'll kill you!

864
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:58,999
- Chink says hello.
- You touch her, you're dead.

865
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:00,666
Guard!

866
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,416
Manly!

867
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:06,416
Guard!

868
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:09,666
- What's your problem?
- I need to use the phone.

869
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:11,624
You know you can't.

870
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,957
The guy is gonna kill my girlfriend!

871
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:16,291
What guy?

872
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:18,666
The guy in the wheelchair!

873
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:22,332
- I've got to warn her!
- The wheelchair is empty.

874
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:25,957
Don't play with me, Manly.
I have to warn her.

875
01:21:26,167 --> 01:21:29,791
Everybody's got problems, Leone.
Get some sleep.

876
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:33,707
God damn!

877
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,041
Doing some spring cleaning?

878
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:47,582
Dallas, come here!

879
01:21:53,125 --> 01:21:54,707
What is it?

880
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:56,291
I need some help.

881
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,582
No questions asked.

882
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,416
You're busting out?
You only have three weeks to go.

883
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:06,749
Just help me.

884
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:09,082
It will only take a couple of days.

885
01:22:09,292 --> 01:22:12,207
- I need it tonight.
- I can't do that.

886
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:13,749
When I finish it's all locked.

887
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:15,374
Listen to me.

888
01:22:15,542 --> 01:22:19,749
Chink has paid a convict off
to get Melissa.

889
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:25,041
I'd love to help but I can't do
the impossible. You're hurting me.

890
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:34,207
I'll take you with me.

891
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:38,749
No shit?

892
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,207
What's the plan?

893
01:22:41,542 --> 01:22:42,957
You'll know when you have to.

894
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:47,124
You're taking the tunnels.

895
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,749
Just be here, alright?

896
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,749
Convict, move out of there.

897
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:56,916
Use some bleach on that.

898
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:59,291
I'm coming out, Colonel.

899
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,666
Linen run.

900
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:06,249
How are you?

901
01:23:06,417 --> 01:23:09,832
You're late. Get it done.

902
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,082
- Yes sir.
- Do you still make that jail-booze?

903
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:17,457
Absolutely not. I've joined
the Alcoholics Unanimous.

904
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,374
You talk some shit, man.

905
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:22,624
It's bad for my nervous system.
It makes me talk too much.

906
01:23:22,792 --> 01:23:23,749
Hurry up.

907
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:26,332
I'll be right out.

908
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:37,082
No! Help!

909
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:47,749
Come on. Let's go.

910
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,499
We've got ten minutes.

911
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:56,541
Sweet dreams, Moby Dick.

912
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,041
Come on!

913
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:00,499
The tools, man.

914
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:15,999
You got it.

915
01:24:19,417 --> 01:24:20,832
Here I go.

916
01:24:21,792 --> 01:24:22,916
Oh God, I'm jumping.

917
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:29,416
There are rats in here, Frank.

918
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,832
No!

919
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:45,541
This way to the steam plant.

920
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:46,666
It's this way.

921
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:48,749
I remember the map, it's this way.

922
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,457
I'm positive. Let's go!

923
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,791
D.T.A., Frank.

924
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:15,624
Isn't that what you taught me?

925
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,124
Right on schedule.

926
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:22,582
I'm sorry.
You're my ticket out of here.

927
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,332
Damn you!

928
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:33,416
You had me set up the whole time?

929
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:38,666
Not the whole time.
I have 30 years to go.

930
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:41,416
The warden made me a deal.

931
01:25:44,417 --> 01:25:45,666
You dumb bastard.

932
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:47,999
He made me a deal!

933
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:49,374
We don't make deals

934
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:51,416
with escaping prisoners.

935
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:57,666
What are you talking about?
You said if I delivered...

936
01:25:58,458 --> 01:26:01,707
Shut up.
You're going back to the population.

937
01:26:02,083 --> 01:26:05,749
Population?
You can't do this to me, warden!

938
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:10,249
I snitched on him.
They'll finish me!

939
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:11,499
Tough.

940
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,916
I came through, god damn it!
We had a deal!

941
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:20,707
That's enough. You'll kill him.

942
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,207
That's enough.

943
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:36,707
You'll get ten years
for a second escape attempt.

944
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:41,374
I knew you'd try. I told them
you were a hard core criminal

945
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:45,624
and they'll believe me now.
And you better believe me.

946
01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:50,957
You'll be doing hard time here
for the rest of your life.

947
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,207
You know what to do.

948
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,166
Some deal maker.

949
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:22,249
See? Shit does float, doesn't it?

950
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:25,291
You know what else?

951
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:29,832
Don't worry about that psycho
hurting your bitch girlfriend.

952
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:33,749
We decided to keep him here.
Didn't we, officer?

953
01:27:41,792 --> 01:27:43,541
She's not my type.

954
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:50,332
We'll teach you a lesson...
graduate you with honors.

955
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:54,166
Switch on the steam, Mastrone!

956
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:57,541
Put him in.

957
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,499
Bring him in here.

958
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,957
Push him in, Darrell. Do it!

959
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:14,416
Do it!

960
01:28:23,792 --> 01:28:25,082
Rape this.

961
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:32,124
My face is burning!

962
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:18,082
School's out, punk.

963
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:23,249
Frank, don't leave me here.

964
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:32,707
I'm sorry.

965
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:35,332
Take me with you.

966
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:58,082
Let him go, Manly.

967
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,666
What are you going to do?

968
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:13,249
Are you ok, Frank?

969
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,249
I'm ok.

970
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:19,666
You can trust me.

971
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,749
Put it down, Dallas.

972
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:24,707
I won't hurt you any more.

973
01:31:24,917 --> 01:31:26,582
Put it down.

974
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:30,374
You don't wanna do it.

975
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:32,874
You fat piece of shit.

976
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:34,416
Don't do it, Dallas.

977
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,791
Are you trying to scare me?

978
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,332
Don't do it!

979
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:41,416
You won't do it!

980
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:42,916
Oh yeah?

981
01:31:43,542 --> 01:31:45,874
You don't have the balls to do it,
punk.

982
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,499
You're wrong.

983
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:48,749
Stoolie.

984
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:50,124
You're wrong.

985
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:52,749
- Put it down.
- You're wrong!

986
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:14,082
Switch to backup.

987
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:16,999
We have a power outage in C Wing.

988
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,374
Go to the utility corridor.

989
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:47,916
You better have a good reason not to
tell me about Leone's escape plans.

990
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:53,332
I have a dead officer and
a dead inmate but no answers!

991
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:57,041
I was saving an informant's life
by keeping it a secret.

992
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,416
Why would a man
with 3 weeks to go

993
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:01,707
try to break out and kill 2 men?

994
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:04,541
We can ask him when we catch him

995
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:26,999
Defect cable
in the utility corridor.

996
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:28,666
He's going onto the roof.

997
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,624
Bring up zone 2.

998
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:04,624
Get more light in there.

999
01:35:06,458 --> 01:35:10,457
I'm in the wellroom.
This is where he went out.

1000
01:35:11,417 --> 01:35:14,082
Check the far bank over there.

1001
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:26,416
That's 150 meters under water.
Do you really think he made it?

1002
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:31,041
Until you bring me a body,
I've got an escaped prisoner.

1003
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:33,957
- This is Drumgoole. Sector 4, over.
- Meissner. Sector 4, go.

1004
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,749
What do you have?

1005
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:37,374
Right now nothing, sir.

1006
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:41,499
I'm thinking of calling the local
and State Police.

1007
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:46,207
No outside agencies.

1008
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:48,374
This is an internal matter.

1009
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:51,707
He's alive. I want him.
Arm a tactical squad

1010
01:35:51,917 --> 01:35:53,291
and meet me in my office.

1011
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,457
Mr. Braden,
we will continue this search.

1012
01:36:21,917 --> 01:36:23,957
You won't get away with it.

1013
01:36:25,667 --> 01:36:27,541
You know that don't you?

1014
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:31,124
I could have got out.

1015
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:39,666
But I'm not going to spend my life
running from you.

1016
01:36:44,667 --> 01:36:46,166
Paul, look at this.

1017
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:53,041
Get inside. Pull it!

1018
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,332
You can't hold me as a hostage.

1019
01:36:56,542 --> 01:36:59,124
Shut up! Do you recognize the chair?

1020
01:37:01,083 --> 01:37:03,666
You built it, didn't you?
Get in there.

1021
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:06,957
Don't think about moving.

1022
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:14,416
You're gonna take me to hell?
I'll show you hell.

1023
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:21,041
Move you leg.

1024
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:22,624
Dallas...

1025
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:25,499
was fried
the way you're going to fry.

1026
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:31,416
And First Base.
You broke his neck!

1027
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,749
You'll fry here.

1028
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:39,874
It's a perfect fit.

1029
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:47,124
You can't make this work.

1030
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:48,916
You're too stupid.

1031
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:50,541
You're scum.

1032
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:52,832
Shut up! I'll show you scum.

1033
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:58,666
You can't kill a man, Frank.
You don't have the guts.

1034
01:38:04,667 --> 01:38:06,957
10 more years, you said.

1035
01:38:08,333 --> 01:38:09,332
How about 20?

1036
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:11,416
Or 30?

1037
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:14,291
It doesn't matter how much I get.

1038
01:38:15,667 --> 01:38:18,374
You won't be satisfied.
You've got me for life.

1039
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,166
Make a hole.

1040
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:22,082
Take it down.

1041
01:38:24,542 --> 01:38:26,124
I'm not doing life for nothing!

1042
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:30,457
Lean on it!

1043
01:38:30,667 --> 01:38:32,291
They'll break that door down.

1044
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:34,791
And when they come in here

1045
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,582
they'll break your skull.
You'll beg me to let them kill you.

1046
01:38:40,292 --> 01:38:41,541
- Come on!
- Meissner!

1047
01:38:44,167 --> 01:38:45,624
Harder!

1048
01:38:50,083 --> 01:38:51,582
Lean on it!

1049
01:38:52,875 --> 01:38:53,707
No!

1050
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:56,874
No!

1051
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,791
Break the window!

1052
01:39:04,875 --> 01:39:05,957
Shoot me!

1053
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:07,791
Don't shoot!

1054
01:39:08,667 --> 01:39:09,791
His hand's taped to it!

1055
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:11,957
No!

1056
01:39:13,667 --> 01:39:14,957
Don't shoot!

1057
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:16,124
Hold your fire.

1058
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:17,541
Hold your fire!

1059
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:18,416
Shoot!

1060
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:22,416
Hold your fire!

1061
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:27,541
Just relax.

1062
01:39:29,792 --> 01:39:32,874
I'm glad you're here.
It's not official without witnesses.

1063
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:38,374
He wants me to accept responsibility
for his escape.

1064
01:39:38,542 --> 01:39:39,624
I don't want a confession.

1065
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:42,041
You set everything up.

1066
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:44,041
What are you talking about?

1067
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,249
I'm talking about Chink Weber.

1068
01:39:46,667 --> 01:39:50,832
The cop that was going
to rape Melissa!

1069
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:53,707
Dallas.

1070
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:56,416
The killing of the kid.

1071
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:00,332
Guilty on all counts.

1072
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:03,124
Prove it. That's your problem.

1073
01:40:03,292 --> 01:40:05,374
You can't prove anything.

1074
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,166
I don't have to prove anything.

1075
01:40:08,708 --> 01:40:10,374
I'm here for an execution.

1076
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:13,207
I demand to be released!

1077
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,832
No!

1078
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:18,624
Don't do it, Leone!

1079
01:40:19,333 --> 01:40:20,582
Take it easy.

1080
01:40:21,708 --> 01:40:24,666
You deserve it. Pay back.

1081
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:29,832
Please, Frank.

1082
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:33,749
Don't kill me.

1083
01:40:34,917 --> 01:40:35,707
It's true.

1084
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:39,957
I confess.

1085
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:40,999
I confess.

1086
01:40:41,167 --> 01:40:44,874
Mr. Meissner,
everything that he said was true.

1087
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:46,499
I set him up.

1088
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:47,957
Everything.

1089
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:53,499
Please.

1090
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:56,707
Don't kill me.

1091
01:40:58,708 --> 01:40:59,832
Don't...

1092
01:41:00,667 --> 01:41:05,249
We'll see you in hell, Drumgoole.

1093
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,541
It works better with this.

1094
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:29,624
Take him to the hole, Mr. Meissner.

1095
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,957
Mr. Braden,

1096
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:32,874
take the prisoner to the hole!

1097
01:41:34,125 --> 01:41:35,124
Cuff him.

1098
01:41:36,208 --> 01:41:39,166
Somebody get me out of this chair.

1099
01:41:48,292 --> 01:41:51,499
Thank you, Mr. Meissner.
I said take him to the hole.

1100
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,874
I can't do that.
Take the warden into custody.

1101
01:41:57,625 --> 01:41:59,749
I said take him. What are you doing?

1102
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:02,082
- Cuff him.
- Stop it!

1103
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:06,166
I am the warden of this institution
and you will obey... stop that!

1104
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:09,499
That was a stupid confession
to save my life.

1105
01:42:10,167 --> 01:42:11,874
Are you crazy, Mr. Meissner?

1106
01:42:12,542 --> 01:42:14,082
No, but you are.

1107
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:17,166
Until this matter is resolved,

1108
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:19,499
you will remain in our custody.

1109
01:42:22,042 --> 01:42:23,832
I'll have your ass for this.

1110
01:42:25,292 --> 01:42:29,124
I'll have your ass.

1111
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:31,124
Move it!

1112
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:45,374
I only wanted to do my time.

1113
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,374
You'll get the chance.

1114
01:42:48,625 --> 01:42:49,832
Move him.

1115
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:21,041
- Take care of yourself.
- You too. Thanks, big man.

1116
01:43:23,083 --> 01:43:24,416
Is that okay?

1117
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,082
It's alright.

1118
01:43:29,542 --> 01:43:32,457
I got this one
from Fidel Castro himself.

1119
01:43:36,125 --> 01:43:37,499
See you, big man.

1120
01:43:58,875 --> 01:43:59,999
Hold it.

1121
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,666
Crack the outside.

1122
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,874
You know what I'll miss about you?

1123
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:08,416
What's that?

1124
01:44:09,542 --> 01:44:11,041
Your incredible smile.

1125
01:44:23,625 --> 01:44:25,332
Take care of yourself, Leone.

1126
01:44:25,542 --> 01:44:26,874
Thanks, Captain.

1127
01:44:38,917 --> 01:44:39,832
Lock up!
