Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,709
We got cenizo...

3
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,049
...that's purple sage...

4
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,588
...agave, nopal....

5
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,428
What's that stuff?

6
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,892
That's whatchamacallit.

7
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,560
That's horse crippler.

8
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,063
This place is a gold mine.

9
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,068
Lead mine.

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,565
What?

11
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,569
I said it's a lead mine.

12
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,868
- Right.
- Why am I talking to you?

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,830
You got that thing on your head.

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,158
You find lots of cactus and shit?

15
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,458
Not just cactus. There's acacias...

16
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,248
- ...the yuccas....
- Looks like a lot of cactus to me.

17
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:36,087
Man knows 150 varieties of beer,
can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.

18
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,301
Cliff!

19
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:41,807
You live in a place,
you should learn about it.

20
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,635
- Explore.
- You've got to look at this.

21
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,727
Don't tell me.

22
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,773
Spanish treasure, right?

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,939
Pieces of eight...

24
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,270
...from the Coronado Expedition.

25
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,110
Jesus!

26
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,838
Was Coronado in the Masons?

27
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,159
The forensics fella's coming down
from San Marcos.

28
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,752
There's no way to know how old
the body is without lab work.

29
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,377
That ring?

30
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,469
Mason's been around a long while.

31
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,722
He a treasure hunter?

32
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,058
Old bullets.

33
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,178
Makes art out of them.

34
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,434
Sheriff says
we shouldn't touch anything.

35
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,727
He can't hear with that rig on.

36
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,481
Mikey!

37
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,864
Hey, what have we got here?

38
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:09,325
We're supposed to leave everything
where we found it.

39
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,243
They're real particular about that.

40
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,330
The scene of the crime.

41
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,676
No telling yet if there's been a crime...

42
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:27,515
...but this country's seen a good number
of disagreements over the years.

43
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,393
He went to school on the post
when we were in Korea.

44
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,406
It's all kids in the same boat, army brats--

45
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,319
His record shows
he's a good student.

46
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:51,239
I'm more worried about the social thing.
Are there, like, gangs or guns--

47
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,785
We haven't had any
serious violence, if that's what you mean.

48
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:58,247
But we've got a pretty lively mix.
Mexican kids...

49
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,882
...anglo kids, black kids.

50
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,802
- And the blacks are what?
- The smallest group.

51
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,167
Except for a couple...

52
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,591
...of Kickapoo kids.

53
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,598
Look, you're obviously a concerned parent.

54
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,185
Chet has no history of getting into trouble.

55
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,427
Pilar....

56
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,220
Is Amado okay?

57
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,228
He's not here?

58
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,231
Is he sick?

59
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,770
He's going to wish he was dead.

60
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,460
Somebody hand me a CD player.

61
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:51,471
They've come a long way
since those old eight-tracks, ain't they?

62
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,805
Something wrong?

63
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,145
Stolen property. I'm hauling
the bunch of you to jail.

64
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,436
If anything else is wrong,
tell me on the way to the station.

65
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,739
Cleaning his toenails
with a pocketknife.

66
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,991
<i>He was the most hygienic</i>
<i>of all the McHenry's.</i>

67
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,490
<i>"Fishbait," Buddy says,</i>
<i>in that quiet way of his...</i>

68
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,622
..."what do you know about the tires
that went missing from Merkel's?"

69
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,586
Fishbait thinks for a minute...

70
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,672
...then lifts up a loose board
from the porch floor...

71
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,959
...and calls down into it.

72
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,595
"Come on out, Hooter, they caught us!"

73
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,722
Buddy Deeds, he had a way.

74
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,976
He'd known who it was
from the tire tracks in the dirt...

75
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,183
...leading from the back of the garage
to where they loaded up.

76
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,685
"Old Fishbait," he said...

77
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:44,524
..."never lifted a thing,
if there was a way he could roll it."

78
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,400
Never be another like him.

79
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,947
You know that boy of his can't cut it.

80
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,279
He's all hat and no cattle.

81
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,202
Hey, fellas.

82
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,459
We was telling a few on your old man.

83
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,872
He was a unique individual.

84
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,543
He was that.

85
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,677
Big day coming up.

86
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:11,053
I wish we'd have thought of it
while he was still living.

87
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,765
Went so unexpected.

88
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,967
Better late than never.

89
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,726
Korean War hero,
sheriff for nearly 30 years....

90
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,804
The Buddy Deeds Memorial Courthouse.

91
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,226
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.

92
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,480
Well, the usual troublemakers.

93
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:31,239
Danny Padilla from the <i>Sentinel</i>.
That crowd.

94
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,028
We call everything else in the country
after Martin Luther King.

95
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:38,449
We can't have one measly courthouse?

96
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,120
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton.

97
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,164
Bad enough
that all the street names are in Spanish.

98
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,046
They were here first.

99
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:49,586
Then let's call it after Big Chief
Shit-In-The-Bucket. That Tonkawa had...

100
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,053
<i>...the Mexes beat by centuries.</i>

101
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,055
Nineteen out of 20 people here
are Mexican.

102
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,551
There was a faction pulling
for that boy killed in the Gulf War--

103
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,681
Yeah. Santiago.

104
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,145
Mexicans that know remember what...

105
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,858
<i>...Buddy was for their people.</i>

106
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,150
<i>Hell, it was Mercedes over there</i>
<i>who swung...</i>

107
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,815
...the deciding vote for him.

108
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,656
<i>She made it an even 3-3.</i>

109
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,358
As mayor, I get to cast the tiebreaker.

110
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:19,283
The old-timers won't have a problem.
They know how Buddy come to be sheriff.

111
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,368
Tell that story, Hollis.

112
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,618
Everybody heard it a million times.

113
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,373
I'd like to hear it.

114
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,496
Your version of it.

115
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,419
Yeah, come on, Hollis.

116
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,085
Well, the two of us...

117
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,679
<i>...were the only deputies back then.</i>

118
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,551
Me and Buddy, in what, '58?

119
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,645
'57, I think.

120
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,396
The sheriff at the time
was big Charlie Wade.

121
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,564
Charlie...

122
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:51,900
...was one of your old-fashioned
bribe-or-bullets kind of sheriffs.

123
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:56,073
He took a healthy bite out of whatever
moved through this country.

124
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,237
It was in here one night...

125
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,036
<i>...back when Jimmy Herrera run the place.</i>

126
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,168
<i>Started over a basket of tortillas.</i>

127
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,467
This beaner fare doesn't agree with me
but the price sure is right.

128
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,431
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks,
most of them relatives.

129
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,929
Those people breed like chickens.

130
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,806
So?

131
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,690
I roust some <i>muchacho</i> on the street
with no papers, all he's got to say is:

132
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,774
<i>I work for Jimmy Herrera.</i>

133
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,822
Sort of a...

134
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:42,491
...I-scratch-his-back-he-washes-mine
arrangement, if you know what I mean.

135
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,753
This'll be one of your pickups.
First of the month, like the rent.

136
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,708
Get the car, Hollis.

137
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,716
I'm not doing it.

138
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,808
Come again?

139
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,108
It's your deal.

140
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,940
There's going to be some left over for you.

141
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,524
I take care of my boys.

142
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,941
That's not the point, Charlie.

143
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,568
You feeling bad about Jimmy?

144
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:24,823
Ask him how big a <i>mordida</i> they took
when he run a place on the other side.

145
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,326
Those old boys from Ciudad León--

146
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,164
I'm not picking it up.

147
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,756
You do whatever I say you do
or else you put it on the trail, son.

148
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,683
How about this, Charlie?

149
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,889
How about you lay that shield
on this table and vanish...

150
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,106
...before you end up dead...

151
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,606
...or in jail?

152
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,031
You're not making sense, Buddy.

153
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,570
Stick around and I'm bringing up charges
on the county road project.

154
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,451
Two-thirds of that money went straight
into your pocket.

155
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,797
You're being mighty careless
with your mouth, son.

156
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,180
You ever shoot a man
who's looking you in the eye?

157
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,315
It's a whole different story, isn't it?

158
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,655
You're fired.

159
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,360
Not a soul in this county isn't sick to death
of your bullshit.

160
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,241
Make yourself scarce and you'll make a lot
of people happy.

161
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,956
- You little piss ant.
- Now...

162
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,073
...or later.

163
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,911
You won't have any trouble finding me.

164
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,960
You're a dead man.

165
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,475
Get the goddamn car.
We're going to Roderick's.

166
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,196
<i>Boy...</i>

167
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,570
<i>...another beer, please.</i>

168
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,908
Yeah,
that Buddy was a cool breeze.

169
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,626
<i>Wade was known to put quite a few people</i>
<i>in the ground...</i>

170
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,877
<i>...and your daddy gets eyeball-to-eyeball</i>
<i>with him.</i>

171
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,756
We made our pickup
at Roderick's place.

172
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,933
<i>Nobody's seen hide nor hair of him since.</i>

173
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:52,013
He went missing the next day along
with $10,000 in county funds from the safe.

174
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,732
<i>Never heard from him again.</i>

175
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,854
Buddy Deeds said a thing,
he damn well backed it up.

176
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,732
Never be another like him.

177
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:07,370
So, I suppose then he arrested
all of Jimmy Herrera's people and...

178
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,447
...sent them back to the other side?

179
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,618
He came to an accommodation.

180
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,875
Money doesn't always have to change
hands to keep the wheels turning.

181
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,625
I know you had problems with your father.

182
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,887
- And he and Muriel--
- Your mother was a saint.

183
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,549
But Buddy Deeds was my salvation.

184
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,186
Won't be another like him.

185
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,478
It is an honor for me...

186
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:40,395
...to assume command of this unit.

187
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,895
I look forward to working with all of you.

188
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,611
I'm sure you're all aware
of the Army's decision...

189
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,409
<i>...to shut this post down.</i>

190
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,996
<i>That doesn't mean, however,</i>
<i>that we're here to mark time...</i>

191
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,789
...until we're reassigned.

192
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,582
You may have heard rumors...

193
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,208
<i>...that I run a very tight operation.</i>

194
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,416
These rumors...

195
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,424
...are not exaggerated.

196
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,456
Somebody call a doctor!

197
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,091
You weren't in here tonight, were you?

198
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,346
No, no, sir.

199
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,971
Go out the back way.

200
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,932
Somebody call a doctor!

201
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,103
Tearing everything down.

202
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:30,821
Our heritage, the memory of the people
who fought and died for this land.

203
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,363
We fought and died for this land too.

204
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,902
We fought the U.S. Army,
the Texas Rangers--

205
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,538
Yeah, and you lost.

206
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,413
Winners get the bragging rights.

207
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:45,495
People. It'd be best if we don't view this
in terms of winners and losers.

208
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,424
The way she teaches,
she's got everything backward.

209
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:50,631
I was on the textbook committee.
Her version--

210
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,880
We think of the textbook...

211
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,094
...as a guide, not as an absolute.

212
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,928
It is not what we set as the standard.

213
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,271
Now, you people can believe
whatever you want...

214
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,099
...but when it comes to teaching--

215
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:08,319
They're our children too. As the majority
in this community, we have the right.

216
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:13,398
The men who founded this state
have the right to have their story told.

217
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,108
The men who founded this state
broke from Mexico.

218
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,987
They needed slavery to be legal
to make a fortune in the cotton business.

219
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:22,703
I think that's a bit of an oversimplification.

220
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:26,376
- You reporting or running this meeting?
- Adding some historical perspective.

221
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,752
You call it history, I call it propaganda.

222
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:32,755
I'm sure they've got their own account
of the Alamo on the other side...

223
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,971
<i>...but our schools shouldn't teach it</i>
<i>that way.</i>

224
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,219
Excuse me.

225
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:42,719
I've only been trying to get across part
of the complexity of our situation here.

226
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,059
Cultures coming together
in both negative and positive ways.

227
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,480
If you mean food and music and all,
I have no problem.

228
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,948
<i>But when you start changing...</i>

229
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,361
...who did what to who--

230
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,866
We're just trying to present
a more complete picture.

231
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,989
That's what's got to stop!

232
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:05,577
There's enough ignorance in the world
without us encouraging it in school.

233
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,839
Now, who are you calling ignorant?

234
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,794
I hope the sucker dies.
Mess with me, that's what you get.

235
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,923
Hospital says the kid is in bad shape.

236
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,339
The shooter local?

237
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,430
Houston. I think he knew the girl
from before.

238
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,099
We'll take a statement from the GI's
before they go back to post.

239
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,724
You can get the story from Otis.

240
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,983
Any poop on the John Doe
we found today?

241
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:32,439
No, nothing much.
Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it.

242
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,399
I'll catch you later.

243
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,575
He's only 15. He's about 5 foot 5--

244
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:49,750
Pilar.

245
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,878
Something wrong?

246
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,628
They've got my son.

247
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:56,716
Here?

248
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:01,798
Somebody called about a house that was
broken into. They say they don't have--

249
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,931
All right, I know what he looks like.

250
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,770
I'll see what's going on.

251
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,098
I was....

252
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,280
I was real sorry about Nando.

253
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,909
He was a good fella.

254
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,499
We haven't talked--

255
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,790
We haven't talked since high school.

256
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,785
Yeah.

257
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,964
I'll go check on your boy.

258
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:41,259
Ritchie didn't say nothing,
'cause he didn't want to get in it.

259
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,810
Then, next thing I know
there's shots and Ritchie's down.

260
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,936
You got some boys you run in earlier?

261
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,569
They tell me you're good at fixing things.

262
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,943
Your father was a hell of a mechanic.

263
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,240
You know, if you figure minimum wage...

264
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,006
...on the time most thieves spend in jail...

265
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,215
...they could have bought
most everything they stole.

266
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:21,134
They asked me to hook it up for them.
I didn't steal anything.

267
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,845
Well, I didn't say you did.

268
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,385
My name's Sam, by the way.

269
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,266
- He's all yours.
- Are you okay?

270
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,434
What's the big deal?

271
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,899
You'll find out when I get you home.

272
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,151
Thanks, Sam.

273
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,067
It's no problem.

274
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,155
It was good seeing you again.

275
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,766
Big O's is the only place
where African American soldiers...

276
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,686
...feel comfortable, sir.

277
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:21,230
- Have we had trouble there before?
- Fistfight now and then.

278
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,490
- This town isn't much.
- They didn't come for a vacation.

279
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:28,526
For many, it's their first time away
from home, dealing with new people....

280
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,113
- I remember my first hitch--
- Substance abuse?

281
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,078
Yes, sir, but I went through the program.
I haven't drunk--

282
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,921
I meant on the post.
How are you dealing with it?

283
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,710
We throw a urine test at them
once a month.

284
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,509
Random numbers...

285
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,586
...maybe 100 people at a time.

286
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,715
- Let's make it once a week for a while.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,888
I sprint the last quarter mile.
You don't have to keep up.

288
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:52,723
Appreciate it, sir.

289
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,774
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.

290
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,521
You get the feeling
he doesn't want to be here?

291
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:02,753
Sam the Man.

292
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,921
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

293
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,639
So, how's business?

294
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,098
Business is booming.

295
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,010
Got your drugs, got your illegals.

296
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:19,601
Had a shooting the other night
at O's place. Soldier got ventilated.

297
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,646
I hear they're closing Fort McKenzie.

298
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,978
It'll pull a lot of jobs out of this county.

299
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:29,449
We'll have folks swimming over to Mexico
to work in the sweat shops.

300
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:32,488
Is that the word on our boy?

301
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,450
This is Skinny.

302
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:36,037
Skinny?

303
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,961
When we find a body, it's Skinny or Stinky.

304
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,536
Depends on how much meat's left
on the bones.

305
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,547
That's a nice job.

306
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:47,342
"A male Caucasian...

307
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,928
"...40 to 60 years old...

308
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,638
"...5 foot 9...

309
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,266
<i>"...5 foot 11.</i>

310
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,304
"Chewed tobacco."

311
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,015
Then we'll get the dental records
and personal effects.

312
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,729
It's Charlie Wade.

313
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,014
That badge....

314
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,516
- Didn't come out of a cereal box.
- No.

315
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:18,289
You know the popular version
of how he left town.

316
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,164
Everybody on the border knows that story.

317
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,205
You got a cause of death?

318
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,542
Skull was intact.

319
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,087
No signs of trauma on what we found.

320
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,044
Not much to go on.

321
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:34,008
So, he could have gone out to the post,
just hopped the fence...

322
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,723
...dug into the dirt on the rifle range...

323
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,637
...and had a heart attack.

324
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:46,143
You remember what old Buddy carried
for a side arm?

325
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,696
Colt Peacemaker.

326
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,895
.45.

327
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,188
He swore by it.

328
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,150
What?

329
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,740
I was just wondering.

330
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,743
Is Buddy on your short list?

331
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,710
If it were some poor <i>majadero</i>
who swam across, got lost in the brush...

332
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,084
...and starved out there
it wouldn't go much further, but...

333
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,007
...this is a once prominent citizen
who disappeared.

334
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:16,674
You've got to investigate.
There's no question about it.

335
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:21,765
I'll keep names out of it until we get
some answers or hit a dead end.

336
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:27,226
You know how the press is when they get
ahold of a murder story, even 40 years old.

337
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,657
Yeah, yeah. They can do a number on you.

338
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:37,203
I remember...

339
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,948
...Charlie Wade come
to my father's hardware store once.

340
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,749
I was just a little boy.

341
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,243
I'd heard stories
about how he shot this one...

342
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,295
...how he shot that one.

343
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,502
The man winked at me.

344
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:54,087
I peed my pants.

345
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:56,842
Winked at me.

346
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,764
The fight against the Spanish,
a bloody conflict for dozens of years...

347
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:06,140
<i>...till they are finally defeated in 1821...</i>

348
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,520
<i>...and Mexican independence is declared.</i>

349
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:13,195
<i>Anglo settlers are invited</i>
<i>to colonize the area.</i>

350
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,699
<i>By the time they begin the movement</i>
<i>against Santa Anna...</i>

351
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:20,202
...they outnumber the Mexicans here
by four to one.

352
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:24,745
The war between Mexico
and the anglo forces ends...

353
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,662
...in 1836...

354
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:31,048
<i>...with the formation</i>
<i>of the Texas republic. Texas...</i>

355
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,293
...joins the United States...

356
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:37,050
...as a state where slavery
is legal in 1845...

357
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:42,216
<i>...after the so-called Mexican War,</i>
<i>then secedes to join...</i>

358
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:46,683
...the Confederacy in 1861.
The Confederacy is beaten...

359
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:50,808
...and the Reformation period here
is marked by range wars...

360
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:53,061
...and race wars and all this...

361
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:55,605
<i>...paralleled by the constant battles...</i>

362
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,534
<i>...between the Mexican</i>
<i>and anglo settlers...</i>

363
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:02,327
...and the various Indian nations.
What are we seeing here, Chet?

364
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,664
Everybody's killing everybody else?

365
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,801
I always wondered
what you mayors do...

366
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,716
...when you're not cutting ribbons.

367
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,090
Sam!

368
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:26,969
Partner.

369
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,772
You caught me playing hooky.

370
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,070
Floating around out here,
playing hell with them bass.

371
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:35,062
Sounds great! Where do I sign up?

372
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,230
You been by your old place lately?

373
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,648
No.

374
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,866
New people painted it some awful color.

375
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:47,034
We found a body out
by Fort McKenzie yesterday.

376
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:49,251
It'd been there a long time.

377
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,744
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

378
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,718
You recall if Charlie Wade was a Mason?

379
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:00,592
Charlie?

380
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:04,716
I believe he used to go for Lodge meetings
over to Laredo.

381
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:08,688
What's Charlie Wade got to do
with your body?

382
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:12,482
All he was wearing was
a big old Masonic ring...

383
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,768
...and a Rio County sheriff's badge.

384
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,322
You remember anything else
from the last night you saw him?

385
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:28,165
I told the story enough times.

386
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:33,629
We were in the car. He was stewing about
his fight with Buddy as we drove over...

387
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:35,541
<i>...to Roderick Bledsoe's.</i>

388
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,914
Bledsoe?

389
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,376
He owned the colored roadhouse
before Otis.

390
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,549
He's still living?

391
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:41,967
No.

392
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:46,893
I think his widow's still in their place
in Darktown, though.

393
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:51,016
You think it was Charlie Wade, huh?

394
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,896
Forensics people are sure of it.

395
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:58,822
You got any idea
who might have put him there?

396
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:02,239
Besides my father, I mean.

397
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,944
There's no call for that, Sam.

398
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,664
Wade made himself a pile of enemies
over the years.

399
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,624
- Buddy was one of them.
- The dedication's tomorrow.

400
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,792
It's a hell of a time
to bring up old business.

401
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:21,546
People have made this whole big thing
around my father. If it's built on a crime...

402
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:23,297
<i>...they deserve to know.</i>

403
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,884
I understand why you might want
to believe he couldn't do it.

404
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:30,095
I understand why you might want
to think he could.

405
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,152
Thanks for your time, Hollis.

406
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,278
Look at all this.

407
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,747
Tackle, boat....

408
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,242
All just to catch a little old fish...

409
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:57,622
...minding his own business
down at the bottom of the lake.

410
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,963
Hardly seems worth the effort,
does it, Sam?

411
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,842
You knew this young man before?

412
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,020
From back in Houston.
We both come up off the street.

413
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:16,395
Did you know
he'd be there last night?

414
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:19,235
If I had, I wouldn't have gone in.

415
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,983
And you
and Private Graves were....

416
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:23,941
We were just dancing.

417
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,991
We're not running a dating service.

418
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,821
I know that, Sergeant.

419
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:32,328
We were just dancing.
There was a bunch of us there.

420
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:36,165
Shadow... just come down
looking for trouble.

421
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:40,790
I don't like to get involved
with soldiers' personal lives...

422
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,296
...but when it interferes with training....

423
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,793
Shadow just gets crazy.

424
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,639
Sergeant, how is Ritchie doing?
Private Graves?

425
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,423
He'll live.

426
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,559
He'll be transferred to Fort Sam...

427
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,056
<i>...as soon as he's stabilized.</i>

428
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,852
He'll probably be getting
a medical discharge.

429
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,186
Will this go on my record?

430
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,689
The incident will be noted.

431
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:07,985
If it happened the way you say...

432
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:11,069
<i>...there hasn't been an infraction.</i>

433
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,699
Thank you, Sergeant.

434
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,161
You're dismissed.

435
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:15,874
Thank you, Sergeant.

436
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,046
You spoil them, Cliff.

437
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,009
- You don't believe her?
- That wasn't an interrogation.

438
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,853
I'm in charge of her sorry ass and frankly--

439
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:39,437
I won't give her the third-degree
because her ex-boyfriend's a thug.

440
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:42,312
She's pulled herself out
of a rough neighborhood.

441
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:46,068
And if she isn't careful,
she's gonna slide right back into it.

442
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,833
Mrs. Bledsoe?

443
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,253
That's me.

444
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,261
I'm Sheriff Deeds.

445
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:14,139
Sheriff Deeds is dead, honey.
You're just Sheriff Junior.

446
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:18,136
Yeah, that's the story of my life.

447
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,522
You ever play one of these?

448
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,194
Yeah, I've seen them.

449
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,984
Don't ever start up on them,
because...

450
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,315
...once you do, you can't stop.

451
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:35,328
I tell myself I'll just play
three little games after breakfast...

452
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,491
...and here I am...

453
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,415
...with half the day gone.

454
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:43,623
May I ask you a few questions
about your husband?

455
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:45,626
<i>Roderick.</i>

456
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:48,379
I ain't gonna say nothing bad
about the man...

457
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:50,467
...but you can ask away.

458
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,344
He had the club on Old Trail Road.

459
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:56,095
We run that club for over 20 years.

460
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:59,010
Give it over to Otis Payne...

461
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,137
...in 1967, April.

462
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,601
You must remember Sheriff Wade.

463
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:07,273
Them days...

464
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:11,067
...you deal with Sheriff Wade
or you didn't deal.

465
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,857
First of the month, every month...

466
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:16,526
<i>...he'd remind you</i>
<i>who you really working for.</i>

467
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,991
So, he squeezed money out of you?

468
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:25,460
It wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass
back then, unless you was a club, see?

469
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,132
Roderick used to say:

470
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:32,303
"Buy yourself a glass,
get a free membership."

471
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,379
Sheriff Wade...

472
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:38,008
...he could close you down anytime.

473
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:40,518
And my father?

474
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,140
Sheriff Buddy was a different story.

475
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:48,480
As long as Roderick throw his weight
the right way at election day...

476
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:52,818
<i>...make sure all the colored come to vote,</i>
<i>throw a barbecue for the right folks....</i>

477
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:55,316
Sheriff Buddy kept to his word.

478
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:57,910
That Sheriff Wade, though...

479
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,747
...he could get ugly.

480
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,792
People didn't complain?

481
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:07,120
Not if you was colored or Mexican.

482
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:09,497
Not if you wanted to keep breathing.

483
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:13,092
I remember the last time I seen him
before he gone missing.

484
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:15,467
He come fussing around our place.

485
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,511
He used to come in
whilst we was in full swing.

486
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,509
<i>Making everybody nervous.</i>

487
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:24,771
<i>Had him a smile like the Grim Reaper.</i>

488
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:28,352
<i>He used to sit there</i>
<i>with his hand on his old gun...</i>

489
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,195
<i>...acting the kingfish with everybody.</i>

490
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,481
<i>Otis Payne come...</i>

491
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,818
<i>...to work for us about that time...</i>

492
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:43,657
<i>...and that boy had him some attitude.</i>

493
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:04,683
Pour it.

494
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,185
What?

495
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:08,854
Pour it.

496
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,409
I know you?

497
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:23,743
Name's Otis.

498
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,995
Otis what?

499
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:28,742
Payne.

500
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,166
They call me "O."

501
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,042
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

502
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:37,961
I sent your daddy to the farm once.

503
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,098
Yeah, I know that.

504
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,218
Why you think that was?

505
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,389
Some crop needed picking
and the man was short-handed.

506
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:53,232
As I remember, it was 'cause
he had a sassy mouth on him.

507
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,862
<i>Must run in the family.</i>

508
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,611
You wouldn't be running numbers
out of this club?

509
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,784
Running numbers is illegal, sir.

510
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:07,285
Running numbers without I knowin'
about it is both illegal and unhealthy.

511
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,078
You remember that.

512
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,004
<i>Son, you're not finished.</i>

513
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:14,371
Pour his.

514
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,467
I prefer it in the bottle.

515
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:17,927
Shut up, Hollis.

516
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,969
How come you don't look familiar?

517
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,560
I've been away, up in Houston.

518
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:30,429
Houston?

519
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,229
I hear they let you boys run wild up there.

520
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,777
Look what you've done now.

521
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,443
Better get something to wipe it up, son.

522
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,574
You spilled it.
Maybe you should wipe it up.

523
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:57,752
I told you to do something. Will you hop
to it or will we have a problem?

524
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:04,217
You don't want to turn tail
in front of your people?

525
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,683
I understand.

526
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:12,097
Come on, Houston, give it a try.

527
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:13,853
Come to Papa.

528
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:17,517
Don't mind him.

529
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:21,361
He's a bit slow, is all.
He don't mean nothing by it.

530
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,112
That the problem, son?

531
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,442
You slow?

532
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:27,201
Otis!

533
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,624
Apologize to the sheriff.

534
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:34,795
Sheriff, you got him too scared to peep.

535
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:37,623
Maybe if you'd put that gun up.

536
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:39,627
You telling me what to do?

537
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,509
No, Sheriff, I'm just....

538
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,297
Is that whisky in them glasses?

539
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:48,635
I'll have to cite you
for violation of a state law.

540
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:51,635
This is a club, Sheriff. You've been here.

541
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:54,733
You people better clear out of here now!

542
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:05,615
Learn how to act your place, son.

543
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:08,788
This isn't Houston.

544
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,951
'Course, I was young...

545
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,956
...and full of beans back then.

546
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:24,380
I didn't understand the spot
I was putting Roderick in.

547
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,723
And that was the last time you saw him?

548
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,110
I think he came in one more time...

549
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,230
...with Hollis and....

550
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:44,028
No, no, your daddy wasn't with him.

551
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,441
Made their monthly pickup.

552
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:51,657
Roderick wasn't in, so I kept my mouth
shut and handed over that envelope.

553
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,708
That was the night he disappeared?

554
00:38:57,171 --> 00:38:58,499
Could have been.

555
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,502
You own a gun?

556
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:09,595
Back then?

557
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:11,596
No.

558
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,141
How about Roderick?

559
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,260
Oh, he kept...

560
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:22,187
...a big old piece back behind the bar,
just so folks knew it was there.

561
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,189
I don't keep one here now.

562
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:27,781
Don't much care for them.

563
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,404
And when my father was sheriff?

564
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:32,903
What about him?

565
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,741
What was your deal with him?

566
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,758
Buddy was more part of the big picture:

567
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,216
County political machine...

568
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,599
...Chamber of Commerce, zoning Board....

569
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:56,099
If I kept those people happy,
he was pretty much on my side.

570
00:39:56,563 --> 00:40:01,439
When somebody thought of starting up
a new bar for the black folks, they'd be....

571
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,230
How should I say this?

572
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:08,111
They'd be officially discouraged.

573
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:11,819
He ever accept cash for a favor?

574
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:23,163
I don't recall a prisoner ever died...

575
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,583
...in your daddy's custody.

576
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,383
I don't recall a man in this county...

577
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,719
...black, white, Mexican...

578
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:35,174
...who'd hesitate for a minute...

579
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:39,511
...before they'd call on Buddy Deeds
to solve a problem.

580
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:42,393
More than that...

581
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:45,896
...I wouldn't care to say.

582
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:51,824
I'm supposed to tell my friends
they're too low-class to hang with?

583
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:52,906
Come on, Amado.

584
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,072
'Cause I'm not like Miss Honor Roll?

585
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:56,824
Leave your sister out of it.

586
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,991
You and those teachers in that dump....

587
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:01,456
<i>Your story's over, so nobody can have fun.</i>

588
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:02,494
You jerk.

589
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:04,497
You have no friends.

590
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,666
Who'd be friends with a <i>pachuco</i> wannabe?

591
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,257
I don't pretend I came on the Mayflower.

592
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:10,969
And those stupid girls.

593
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,169
Shut up.

594
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:15,763
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school
she's in love with Santo Guerra.

595
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:16,764
So?

596
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,425
You can't be desperately in love
when you're 14.

597
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:22,562
<i>Not if you have half a brain in your head.</i>

598
00:41:22,649 --> 00:41:24,309
Of course, you can.

599
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:25,857
What?

600
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,071
It's got nothing to do with being smart.

601
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:32,605
It's ancient goddamn history, Danny.

602
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:36,616
1963, they dam up the north branch
to make Lake Pescadero...

603
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:38,698
...and a whole town disappears.

604
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,035
A squatter's town!

605
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:44,621
People lived in Perdido for over 100 years!
Mexicans and Chicanos are deported...

606
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:48,580
...forcibly evicted by our local hero,
Buddy Deeds, and his department.

607
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,965
There was a bill from the state legislature.

608
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:54,303
Families were split apart!
A whole community was destroyed!

609
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:58,760
And who gets Lakefront property
bought for a fraction of the market price?

610
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:03,100
Buddy Deeds, Sheriff of Rio County,
and his Chief Deputy, Hollis Pogue.

611
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:05,274
Are you finished?

612
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,609
Look, I'm not after you, Sam.

613
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:12,647
I just think people ought to know
the full story on Buddy Deeds.

614
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,661
That makes two of us.

615
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:25,085
What's the big deal? Go back over,
talk to the man, and bury the hatchet.

616
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,539
Why me? He's had almost 40 years
and I haven't heard from him.

617
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:30,091
He was probably embarrassed.

618
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:33,461
Otis Payne was never embarrassed
about a thing in his life.

619
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,594
You were 8 when he left.

620
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:39,051
He moved three houses down
with my mother's best friend.

621
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:40,681
Dad.

622
00:42:41,395 --> 00:42:43,637
"Delmore, where's your daddy?"

623
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:47,437
Godforsaken town.
Everybody in everybody else's business.

624
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:49,394
Everybody loved Otis. Big "O."

625
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:52,736
Always there with a smile or a loan...

626
00:42:52,823 --> 00:42:55,740
- ...or a free drink.
- Dad, can I talk to you about track?

627
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:56,822
People change.

628
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,609
Not that much.

629
00:42:58,704 --> 00:42:59,700
I talked to the coach.

630
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,077
I told you. Next year,
if your grades are high.

631
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:03,411
I have a B average!

632
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,287
How many B students do you think
they take at West Point?

633
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:08,869
We'll be here for three years.
We'll have to see him.

634
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:10,579
No, we don't.

635
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:23,804
Get off the phone.
We've got a big wedding.

636
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:24,976
Mommy....

637
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,726
They are getting stupider
every year.

638
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,192
Maybe you're getting less patient.

639
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:38,115
If they're going to survive,
they have to know how to work.

640
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:41,067
You hire illegals,
what do you expect?

641
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:43,656
Nobody's illegal in my cafe!

642
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:47,623
They've got green cards,
relatives who were born here.

643
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:50,915
If they only had a little common sense,
I'd be happy.

644
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:54,126
If you took more time training them,
you wouldn't have to--

645
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:57,717
Did you come here to teach me
how to run my business?

646
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:07,935
Do you want to take a trip...

647
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:09,559
<i>...down south with us?</i>

648
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,726
<i>Maybe see where you grew up?</i>

649
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:13,605
Why would I want to go there?

650
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,154
You must be curious...

651
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:19,153
...how it's changed. Amado is
into this big <i>tejano</i>-roots thing...

652
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,365
<i>...and I've never been further</i>
<i>than Ciudad Leön</i>.

653
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,288
You want to see Mexicans?

654
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,580
Open your eyes and look around you.

655
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,833
We're up to our ears in them.

656
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:33,250
Mommy...

657
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,880
...how old were you when my father died?

658
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,221
He was killed.

659
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,639
Right, when he was killed.

660
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:46,966
A little older than Paloma is now.

661
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:49,805
How come you never remarried?

662
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,476
It just didn't happen.

663
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,399
<i>There must have been...</i>

664
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:57,651
...somebody.

665
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:00,575
I was too busy.

666
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,196
Nobody is too busy.

667
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:06,910
Maybe now.

668
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,330
It was different back then.

669
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:12,836
I had to do all the shopping,
all the cooking....

670
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:17,169
What do I need some <i>chulo</i> with grease
under his nails to drink up the profit?

671
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:19,257
Thank you.

672
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:20,833
I don't mean Fernando.

673
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:24,892
When I brought him home,
those were your exact words:

674
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,051
"A <i>chulo</i> with grease under his nails."

675
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:28,306
I never said that.

676
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:31,230
You made it pretty damn clear.
You thought he was nobody.

677
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:34,230
I thought you could do better.

678
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,895
What? What?

679
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:40,772
Become a nun? You didn't even want me
to go out with anglos.

680
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:43,404
I never said that. Just that boy.

681
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:45,906
"That boy."

682
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,406
Say his name, for Christ's sake.

683
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:54,994
You people are stealing from me.

684
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,012
<i>Is she your mother?</i>

685
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,510
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

686
00:46:07,851 --> 00:46:10,521
Now, I'm as liberal as the next guy.

687
00:46:10,854 --> 00:46:13,061
If the next guy is a redneck.

688
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,358
But I got to say...

689
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:19,228
...I think there's something
to this cold-climate business.

690
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:22,104
I mean, you go to the beach...

691
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:23,950
...what do you do?

692
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:28,944
Drink a few beers, wait for that fish
to flop up on the sand.

693
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:32,207
You can't build no civilization that way.

694
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,499
But you got a cold winter coming on...

695
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,420
...you got to plan ahead.

696
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:40,127
That gives your old cerebral cortex
a workout.

697
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:42,625
Good thing you were born down here then.

698
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:47,756
You joke about it, Sam,
but we are in a state of crisis.

699
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:51,137
<i>The lines of demarcation are getting fuzzy.</i>

700
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:55,351
To run a successful civilization, you've got
to have your lines of demarcation...

701
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,644
...between right and wrong,
this one and that one.

702
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:00,820
Your daddy understood that.

703
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,897
<i>He was.... What do you call it?</i>

704
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:07,032
The referee in this damn <i>menudo</i>
we got down here.

705
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:12,489
He understood how most folks don't want
their salt and sugar in the same jar.

706
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:14,829
If you mixed drinks...

707
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,745
...as bad as you mix metaphors...

708
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:18,580
<i>...you'd be out of a job.</i>

709
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:21,793
You're the last white sheriff
this town will see.

710
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:26,137
Hollis retires next year.
Jorge Guerra will take over.

711
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:28,673
This is it, right here, Sam.

712
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:34,052
This bar is the last stand.
<i>Se habla</i> American, goddamn it!

713
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,929
And even in here, it's sliding away.

714
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:42,059
Take that pair over there in the corner.

715
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:46,818
A place like this, 20 years ago...

716
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:51,403
...Buddy'd been on them.
He'd have went over there...

717
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:53,323
<i>...and given them a warning.</i>

718
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:57,496
Not that he had it in for the colored,
but just as a kind of a safety tip.

719
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,296
Yeah, bet he would.

720
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,168
The day that man died...

721
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:08,002
...they broke the goddamn mold.

722
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:16,851
- Seriously.
- Seriously?

723
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:19,098
I think we should get married.

724
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,060
We've been through this before.

725
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,563
We should just do it.

726
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:27,354
And if I get transferred to another post?
Germany or Korea?

727
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:29,325
I'd ask for a transfer too.

728
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,402
Which they'd most likely turn down.

729
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,820
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.

730
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:37,201
You know, you are something.

731
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:41,410
Man's going to retire in two years
and he offers to quit.

732
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,255
Big goddamn deal.

733
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:45,080
Excuse me.

734
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:46,421
Sheriff.

735
00:48:47,136 --> 00:48:48,713
This is Sergeant....

736
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:51,011
This is Priscilla Worth.

737
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:54,224
Sheriff Deeds was with us
on our archeological find.

738
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,385
They're building a shopping mall there?

739
00:48:57,187 --> 00:49:00,603
If certain people have their way,
it's gonna be a new jail.

740
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:04,353
They're closing down military
and putting up jails...

741
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:05,903
<i>...like 7-11 stores.</i>

742
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:11,945
Do either of you have any idea
when they stopped using that site...

743
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:13,530
<i>...as a rifle range?</i>

744
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,363
Fort McKenzie stopped training infantry...

745
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:20,122
<i>...there in the late '50s. It was just</i>
<i>a playground for the jackrabbits...</i>

746
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:22,998
...till they gave it to the county last year.

747
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,338
You know who it was they dug up?

748
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:27,293
Not for sure yet.

749
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,670
But I kind of wish they hadn't.

750
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:41,644
In English, Enrique.
This is the United States.

751
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,560
We speak English.

752
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:46,269
Is very beautiful, your car.

753
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,863
- Good night, Enrique.
- <i>Buenas noches, señora.</i>

754
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:27,057
Carolyn....

755
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:29,434
<i>Knock that off.</i>

756
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:43,876
Black Seminoles?

757
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:46,921
Hobby of mine.

758
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:49,083
A few artifacts...

759
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,753
...couple of pieces one of your men
out on the base made.

760
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,846
Admission's free.

761
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:02,435
This is where he was shot?

762
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:05,690
He fell right by the door.

763
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:07,316
You get much of that here?

764
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:10,356
It's a bar.

765
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:13,190
Folks come together...

766
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:16,778
...drink, fall in love, fall out of love...

767
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,779
...hear their grudges out.

768
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:21,197
Deal drugs in the bathroom.

769
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,158
If I thought it would do any good...

770
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:26,789
...I'd put up a sign telling them not to...

771
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:30,712
...right next to the one about
the employees washing their hands.

772
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,843
This here is Carolyn.

773
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:35,877
<i>Honey...</i>

774
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:38,640
...this is my son, Delmore.

775
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:43,011
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

776
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:48,149
I'll be in the back waiting for that delivery.

777
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:56,987
So?

778
00:51:57,826 --> 00:51:58,822
So.

779
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:04,289
Tell me why I shouldn't make
this place off-limits.

780
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:09,245
This is an official visit then.

781
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:12,707
I assume most of your business
is with our people.

782
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:19,799
Your boys are cooped up together.
They need a place to let the steam out.

783
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:24,091
If they're black, there's not but one spot
in this county...

784
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:25,977
...where they feel welcome.

785
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:27,931
It's been that way...

786
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:30,141
...since before you were born.

787
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:32,725
We have an enlisted man's club
at the post.

788
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:36,520
You the man out there now, ain't you?

789
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:38,938
It's your call.

790
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:41,072
That's right.

791
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,290
I've been hearing about
this new command out there...

792
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,332
...for a couple of weeks now.

793
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:52,380
The boys say they hear he's a hard case...

794
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,165
...a real spit-and-polish man.

795
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:58,464
<i>Full bird colonel by the name of Payne.</i>

796
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,635
Bet you never figured
you'd end up back here.

797
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:07,019
When the Army offers you a command,
you go...

798
00:53:07,146 --> 00:53:08,521
...wherever it is.

799
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:10,768
Right.

800
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,182
I hear things too.

801
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:14,937
They call you...

802
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:17,528
...the mayor of Darktown.

803
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:22,614
Over the years this is the one place
that's always been there.

804
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:26,452
I loan a little money out,
I've settled a few arguments.

805
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,501
I got a cot in the back. Folks get scared
to go home, they spend the night.

806
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:35,964
There's not enough of us
to run anything in this town.

807
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:41,254
It's the Holiness Church...

808
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:42,591
...or Big O's.

809
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:46,265
And the people make a choice.

810
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:49,726
Most of them choose both.

811
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:53,055
It's not like there's a borderline...

812
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:55,897
...between the good people
and the bad people.

813
00:53:56,737 --> 00:53:58,017
<i>You're not on either...</i>

814
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,572
...one side or the other.

815
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,191
Right.

816
00:54:06,914 --> 00:54:08,657
Will I meet that family of yours?

817
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:14,787
Why would you want to do that?

818
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:18,080
Because I'm your father.

819
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:29,515
You'll get official notification
when I make my decision.

820
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:48,239
So, that's him.

821
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:50,241
Yeah, that's him.

822
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,743
Historic occasion, ain't it?

823
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:56,124
Seems like we have another one
every week.

824
00:54:56,213 --> 00:55:00,424
Jorge and the boys down at the Chamber
of Commerce got to keep things humming.

825
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:02,211
Building up tourism, Sam.

826
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:06,929
Most people come here to catch bass and
get laid at the Boy's Town in Ciudad León.

827
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:11,726
You ought to put up a banner, "Frontera,
Texas - Gateway to Inexpensive Pussy."

828
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:13,970
That kind of talk doesn't help.

829
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,060
I'd rather have that
than a 10-foot-high catfish statue.

830
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:20,987
Eddie Richter at the <i>Sentinel</i>
will kill that story.

831
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:23,608
The Perdido thing?

832
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,947
He agreed it wasn't exactly news.

833
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:29,110
Danny will be out for blood the next time.

834
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:33,119
That's why we need to talk to you
about the new jail.

835
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:35,450
Come on, we don't need a new jail.

836
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:37,377
That's a matter of opinion.

837
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:40,748
We're already renting cells
to the Feds for their overflow.

838
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:45,794
It wouldn't be your construction company
who'd get the bid on building this thing?

839
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:48,426
And, Jorge....

840
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,387
You wouldn't be thinking
about a couple dozen new jobs...

841
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:56,012
...to dangle by the voters when you run
for mayor next election?

842
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:59,190
Damn it, Sam! The people
are concerned about crime.

843
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:02,272
I'm not gonna campaign
against your deal here.

844
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,030
But if anybody asks...

845
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:07,946
...I've got to tell them the truth.
We don't need a new jail.

846
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:09,400
We backed you--

847
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:12,412
When you backed me,
you needed somebody named Deeds...

848
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:14,953
...to bump the other fella out of office.

849
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:20,619
- Hey, folks.
- Fenton, what's up, buddy?

850
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:23,965
- How you doing?
- Let's get this thing over with.

851
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:38,638
I never thought I'd see
a buddy of mine dating a woman...

852
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:40,897
...with three bars on her shoulder.

853
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:42,942
It's beyond what you'd call dating.

854
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:44,819
You're going to get married?

855
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:45,901
Maybe.

856
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:47,484
You met her family?

857
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:51,280
They gonna be cool
about you being a white guy?

858
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:56,115
Priscilla says they think a woman over 30
who's not married must be a lesbian.

859
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,371
She figures they'll be so relieved
I'm a man....

860
00:56:59,461 --> 00:57:03,506
It's always heartwarming to see
a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.

861
00:57:03,966 --> 00:57:06,338
But marriage, man, I don't know.

862
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:08,292
Let's see....

863
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:11,347
I did two tours of duty in Southeast Asia...

864
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:13,840
...and I was married for five years.

865
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:16,640
I couldn't tell you
which experience was worse.

866
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:17,428
Mikey?

867
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:20,356
I knew she was Japanese,
but she didn't tell me...

868
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:22,315
...the Ninja-assassin part.

869
00:57:22,651 --> 00:57:25,854
Parents acted like I'd blow my nose
on their curtains.

870
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:30,523
If I stayed out past 10:00,
she'd do a Madam Butterfly routine.

871
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:32,402
Mikey, look at this.

872
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,026
What?

873
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,327
It's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets.

874
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:37,743
It's a .45.

875
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:42,085
This is the stuff we picked up
the other day, right?

876
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:45,629
- Rest of this is all .30 caliber.
- They used M-1s.

877
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:50,585
So what's a pistol slug doing
on a rifle range?

878
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:54,179
We'd better call that sheriff.

879
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:58,222
Back in the early '70s...

880
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:03,599
...a reporter from a national magazine
asked the governor of our Lone Star state:

881
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:05,022
"Governor...

882
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:07,105
<i>"...what's your ideal...</i>

883
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:09,817
<i>"...of what a real Texan ought to be?"</i>

884
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:12,355
<i>Governor said:</i>

885
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:14,367
<i>"Son, that's easy.</i>

886
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,150
<i>"Just go down to...</i>

887
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:18,120
<i>"...Rio County and look at...</i>

888
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:20,164
"...Sheriff Buddy Deeds."

889
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:24,207
Thank you.

890
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,869
There's...

891
00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:29,050
...one more person
we ought to hear from and...

892
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:33,550
...I think he's somebody that knew Buddy
better than any of us.

893
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:35,177
Sam....

894
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:36,802
Say a few words?

895
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:45,649
Well, you folks who remember my father...

896
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:47,895
...knew him as sheriff.

897
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:51,737
But at home he was also judge, jury...

898
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:54,700
<i>...and executioner.</i>

899
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,122
This is a real honor you're doing him today.

900
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:05,792
If Buddy was around, I know his hat size
would be getting bigger every minute.

901
00:59:07,464 --> 00:59:12,091
I used to think there wasn't a place here
you could hide from my old man.

902
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,595
And now I'm sure of it.

903
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,551
<i>I do appreciate it, though.</i>

904
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:25,849
And wherever he is, Buddy's putting
the beer on ice for you. So, thank you.

905
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:33,482
And now, my favorite council member...

906
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:37,952
...and one of Frontera's
most respected businesswomen...

907
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,576
...Mrs. Mercedes Cruz...

908
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,617
...will do the honors.

909
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,807
It does look kind of like Buddy.

910
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:05,896
I think he'll run
that Mexican kid in for loitering.

911
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:07,974
Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.

912
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:20,947
Field trip?

913
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:22,450
Lunch hour.

914
01:00:22,623 --> 01:00:24,948
My next class isn't until 1:30.

915
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:29,127
You want to take a walk?

916
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:44,928
They cooked the whole thing up
without asking me.

917
01:00:45,229 --> 01:00:46,972
People liked him.

918
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:50,976
Most people did, yeah.

919
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:56,605
I remember him watching me once...

920
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:58,990
...when I was little...

921
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:00,820
...before you and I....

922
01:01:04,164 --> 01:01:07,284
I was in the playground
with all the other kids.

923
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,332
I thought he was only looking at me.

924
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:14,210
I was afraid he was going to arrest me.

925
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,464
He had those eyes, and that....

926
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:17,791
Yeah.

927
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:21,838
It's weird what you remember.

928
01:01:27,146 --> 01:01:28,474
Your boy there.

929
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:30,311
Amado.

930
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:31,513
Nice looking kid.

931
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:32,771
He hates me.

932
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:35,852
No.

933
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:41,990
With Paloma, it's like she pities
and tolerates me, totally age-appropriate.

934
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:43,994
But with Amado...

935
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:48,494
...you know, he's always had
difficulty reading and me...

936
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:53,710
...being a teacher and caring
about those things, it's like a betrayal.

937
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:55,541
But Fernando did okay.

938
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,002
He dropped out.

939
01:01:57,092 --> 01:02:01,671
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody.
He just wanted to fix their cars.

940
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:07,634
I spent my first 15 years
trying to be just like Buddy.

941
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:10,897
The next 15 trying
to give him a heart attack.

942
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:21,188
So, why did you come back here, Sam?

943
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:26,369
I got divorced...

944
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:32,250
...and I wouldn't work
for my father-in-law anymore.

945
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:35,580
<i>And the fellas down here...</i>

946
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:38,457
<i>...they said they'd back me.</i>

947
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:41,836
You don't want to be sheriff.

948
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:46,761
I got to admit,
it's not what I thought it'd be.

949
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:49,766
Back when Buddy had it....

950
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:56,142
Hell, I'm just a jailer.

951
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:01,106
Run a 60-room hotel
with bars on the windows.

952
01:03:05,494 --> 01:03:06,988
Do you remember this?

953
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:12,951
I ought to head back.

954
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:16,955
It looks real bad
if a teacher's late for class.

955
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,088
It's real nice to talk with you, Sam.

956
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:54,124
Are you going to tell her?

957
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:58,081
Are you going to tell him?

958
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:00,045
He doesn't need to know my business.

959
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,716
He's going to find out.

960
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:05,049
What is he going to do, arrest us?

961
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:11,764
It's supposed to be a big sin
even if you love each other.

962
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,764
Do you believe that?

963
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:17,686
No.

964
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,869
Me neither.

965
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,415
Private Johnson!

966
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:49,548
Report to the sergeant
in the orderly's room.

967
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,462
The doctor will have a look at you.

968
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,096
No, I'm feeling okay.

969
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:54,884
I'm happy to hear it.

970
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,841
You go put some pee-pee in the cup
for Dr. Innis and I'll feel okay too.

971
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,138
You testing me?

972
01:05:02,606 --> 01:05:06,438
You and 119 other fortunate individuals.
Put it in gear.

973
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,942
- Take this shit off now.
- You've talked so much trash today!

974
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,691
You better be good, boy.

975
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:20,239
"Boy"? You're the good boy.
The man say "fetch" and you fetch.

976
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,708
Just doing my job.

977
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,081
White man's using you
to keep the black man down.

978
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:28,298
This isn't Houston. We run things now.
Our good day has come.

979
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:31,217
You chumps haven't had a good day
since the Alamo.

980
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,966
Lupe....

981
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:43,648
Can you get me Ben Wetzel up in Austin?

982
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,302
Wetbacks again.

983
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,228
Border Patrol?

984
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,294
Mom?

985
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,413
Yeah.

986
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:36,051
You staying out here?

987
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,749
For a while.

988
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:43,009
What's she singing about?

989
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,678
What do you think?

990
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,032
Hey, 'morning, sir!

991
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,946
Hey, Pete. How's it going?

992
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,281
Time marches on.

993
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:30,702
How much you got left?

994
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,250
Three months.

995
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:37,328
Stop growing that locoweed at your
place, you'd see more daylight.

996
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:39,914
It was for personal consumption.

997
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,297
You going to smoke an acre and a half
of marijuana?

998
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:47,216
I got a bad stomach.
It helps me to digest.

999
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,680
Your father never bothered me about it.

1000
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:54,390
Leastways not till the drug people
got on his case in the late '60s.

1001
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:57,777
I thought he busted you
a couple of times.

1002
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:58,939
No.

1003
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,904
Different charge.

1004
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,941
I had a still.

1005
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:06,616
Made my own mescal.
That's how come I ruined my stomach.

1006
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,486
I'm surprised he bothered with it.

1007
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,786
He was afraid I'd poison somebody.

1008
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,325
Your father tried to do good for people.

1009
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,497
- So I've heard.
- And your mother...

1010
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:20,048
...she was a saint.

1011
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:23,248
Remember that summer I built that patio
at your house?

1012
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,633
She made me lunch every day.

1013
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,342
You were working there.

1014
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:31,303
It could have been another box lunch
from the jail.

1015
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,645
So you built our patio
while you were on the county?

1016
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:40,063
Out in the fresh air?
Nice gringo lady making you pies?

1017
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,275
Who'd sit in that jail cell all day?

1018
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:47,442
Sheriff Buddy, man.
<i>There's no one like him.</i>

1019
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,365
After that <i>cabrön</i>, Charlie Wade.

1020
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:53,028
I heard Wade was a bit tough
on the Mexicans.

1021
01:10:57,795 --> 01:11:01,164
He murdered Eladio Cruz.
Is that tough enough for you?

1022
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:04,837
Murdered him?

1023
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,846
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes.

1024
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:11,098
Shot him in cold blood.

1025
01:11:11,183 --> 01:11:13,757
<i>Charlie Wade was a big asshole.</i>

1026
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,761
Sam....

1027
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,722
Wait up.

1028
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,692
You're out early.

1029
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,195
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.

1030
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,611
Well, I'm working on a few things.

1031
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,696
I'm going over to the other side.

1032
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,989
Republicans?

1033
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,705
No, Mexico.

1034
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,546
Got to talk to someone.

1035
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,875
They got telephones.

1036
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:45,999
No.

1037
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,087
It's got to be in person.

1038
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,421
Sam, I....

1039
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:56,561
The Committee....

1040
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,637
Jorge and Fenton and all, they...

1041
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:01,608
...they've asked me--

1042
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:04,148
They want you to stand for sheriff
next election.

1043
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,775
Yeah.

1044
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,901
You'd do a good job.

1045
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,483
Thanks.

1046
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,068
What about you?

1047
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,699
I don't know if I'll still want it.

1048
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:24,036
I just didn't want to go around your back.

1049
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,964
I appreciate you telling me.

1050
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:30,964
You think we need a new jail?

1051
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:35,934
Well, Sam....

1052
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,219
It's a complicated issue.

1053
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,603
Yeah, Ray.

1054
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,061
You'd be a hell of a sheriff.

1055
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:40,828
Down here...

1056
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,917
<i>...we don't throw everything away</i>
<i>like you gringos do.</i>

1057
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,624
Recycling, right?

1058
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,961
We invented that.

1059
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,631
The government doesn't have
to tell people to do it.

1060
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,098
You own this place, huh?

1061
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,354
This place...

1062
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,639
...the one across the street...

1063
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:08,140
...three or four others in Ciudad León.

1064
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:14,406
"King of the Tires."

1065
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:20,408
A lot of your people rolling over that bridge
on my rubber.

1066
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,079
You lived in the States for a while?

1067
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:24,997
Fifteen years.

1068
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,621
Made some money, came back here?

1069
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,835
Something like that.

1070
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,467
Hey, you ever know
a fella named Eladio Cruz?

1071
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:41,007
You're the sheriff of Rio County, right?

1072
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,282
Step across this line.

1073
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,330
You're not the sheriff of nothing anymore.

1074
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:12,631
Just some <i>tejano</i> with a lot of questions
I don't have to answer.

1075
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,253
<i>A bird flying south...</i>

1076
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,129
...you think he sees this line?

1077
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,006
Rattlesnake, <i>jabalina</i>...

1078
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,512
...whatever you got.

1079
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:28,143
You think halfway across that line
they start thinking different?

1080
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,357
Why should a man?

1081
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:34,438
Your government's been pretty happy
to have that line.

1082
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,855
The question's just been where to draw it.

1083
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:46,118
My government can go fuck itself
and so can yours.

1084
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,285
I'm talking about people here.

1085
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,494
Men.

1086
01:15:58,012 --> 01:15:59,387
Eladio Cruz...

1087
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:03,929
<i>...is giving his friends a lift one day</i>
<i>in his</i> camión.

1088
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:07,767
<i>But since they're on one side</i>
<i>of this invisible line and not the other...</i>

1089
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:10,690
<i>...they got to hide</i>
<i>in the back</i> como criminales.

1090
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:14,773
<i>And because over there</i>
<i>he's just another Mex</i> bracero...

1091
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:17,194
<i>...any man with a badge is his</i> jefe.

1092
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:23,943
CHUCHO:

1093
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,681
What's in the back?

1094
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,392
Not much, <i>jefe</i>. Some watermelons.

1095
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,980
I'm driving them up to the market.

1096
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,024
They could bring a good price.

1097
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,490
I heard somebody's been
hauling wets on this road.

1098
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:47,194
I haven't seen anybody doing that.

1099
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,245
That person's been bragging
all over the county...

1100
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:54,749
...how he doesn't have to cut
that gringo sheriff in on it.

1101
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,251
Run his own operation without any help.

1102
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,128
<i>What's your name?</i>

1103
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,082
Eladio Cruz.

1104
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:07,050
You know this road's got a bad reputation.

1105
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,928
Reputation?

1106
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,761
<i>Bandidos</i>, Injuns.

1107
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:15,853
Many an unfortunate soul
has been ambushed out on this stretch.

1108
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,267
I hope you're carrying some protection.

1109
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:19,766
Protection?

1110
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:23,111
You carrying a firearm, son?

1111
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:24,985
Don't lie to me now.

1112
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:29,277
Just a shotgun.

1113
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,534
Just a shotgun.

1114
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,289
Then let me have a look at that.

1115
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,223
Little greaser son of a bitch is running
a goddamn bus service.

1116
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,932
Thinks he can make a fool
out of Charlie Wade.

1117
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,353
Get them wets out of the back.

1118
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,899
See what we've got.

1119
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:03,941
You killed him!

1120
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,148
You got a talent
for stating the obvious, son.

1121
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,518
Steve called for you.

1122
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,604
Steve?

1123
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:44,733
Steve.
Board of Education Steve, who likes you.

1124
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:49,108
He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls,
I can tell.

1125
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:52,038
Spanish. My mother would have
a heart attack.

1126
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:54,287
Your mother's family is Spanish?

1127
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,165
They go back to Cortés.

1128
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,579
When he was riding by they were squatting
in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.

1129
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,498
You've got to be interested in somebody.
All you do is work.

1130
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:07,878
All my mother does is work.
It's how you get to be Spanish.

1131
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,678
How about this sheriff?

1132
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:11,176
Sheriff?

1133
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,596
The old high-school heartthrob sheriff?

1134
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:15,891
I thought you were crazy about each other.

1135
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,303
He's available. You're available.

1136
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,722
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.

1137
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:24,570
You told me one time it was true love.

1138
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:30,445
Nobody stays in love for 23 years.

1139
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:08,984
Let's go.

1140
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,064
Goddamn it.

1141
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:14,816
Come here. Come on.

1142
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:18,495
- What the hell are you doing, asshole?
- How old is that girl?

1143
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,456
Get your clothes in order, missy.

1144
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:23,086
Where's your goddamn sense?

1145
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,792
You got no fucking right!
Stay out of my life!

1146
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:28,216
Give me the keys.

1147
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,925
What should I do with her?

1148
01:21:30,011 --> 01:21:32,846
Drive her home.
Tell her mother where we found her.

1149
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,463
- Leave her alone!
- Move it, boy!

1150
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:41,303
Don't tell my mother. She'll kill me.

1151
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:42,393
Pilar!

1152
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:44,142
Don't eye me.

1153
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,312
Git!

1154
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,358
Follow me.

1155
01:25:08,813 --> 01:25:11,648
We thought we were something,
didn't we?

1156
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:15,850
Yeah.

1157
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:21,653
And I look at my kids in school...

1158
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,735
...10th, 1 1th-graders.

1159
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,572
That's who we were. Children.

1160
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:35,751
I mean, what did we know about anything?

1161
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:41,590
Nothing.

1162
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,182
When Nando died...

1163
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,055
...it was so sudden...

1164
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:55,889
...I kind of went into shock for a while...

1165
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,894
...and then I woke up and...

1166
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:05,402
...there was the rest of my life
and I had no idea what to do with it.

1167
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:15,910
You know, the other day you asked...

1168
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,089
...why I came back.

1169
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:20,838
Yeah?

1170
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:26,088
I came back 'cause you were here.

1171
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:51,454
My mother hasn't changed a song
since I was 10.

1172
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:15,298
Wow.

1173
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:18,806
Yeah.

1174
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:30,689
How come it feels the same?

1175
01:29:33,077 --> 01:29:34,536
I don't know.

1176
01:29:35,538 --> 01:29:37,198
It just feels good.

1177
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:41,162
Always did.

1178
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:50,172
So....

1179
01:29:54,015 --> 01:29:56,553
What are we going to do about this?

1180
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:02,303
More...

1181
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:04,680
...I hope.

1182
01:30:34,263 --> 01:30:36,386
How long have you lived here?

1183
01:30:44,732 --> 01:30:45,930
Two years.

1184
01:30:46,901 --> 01:30:49,226
There's nothing on the walls.

1185
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:51,237
No pictures.

1186
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,359
I don't have kids.

1187
01:30:58,746 --> 01:31:00,324
Other pictures....

1188
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:05,037
I don't know. It's nothing I want
to look back on.

1189
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:08,127
Like your story's over.

1190
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:12,418
I've felt that way...

1191
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:14,090
...yeah.

1192
01:31:15,805 --> 01:31:16,919
It isn't.

1193
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:21,096
Not by a long shot.

1194
01:31:25,773 --> 01:31:27,053
Pilar....

1195
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:33,730
What was your father's name?

1196
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:35,772
Eladio.

1197
01:31:36,784 --> 01:31:38,112
Eladio Cruz.

1198
01:32:28,669 --> 01:32:30,163
That's John Horse.

1199
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:33,704
<i>The Spanish down in Florida call him...</i>

1200
01:32:33,883 --> 01:32:35,294
..."Juan Caballo."

1201
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,047
John Horse.

1202
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:40,721
He a black man or an Indian?

1203
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:41,838
Both.

1204
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:44,718
He was part of the Seminole nation.

1205
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:48,475
<i>Got pushed down into the Florida</i>
<i>Everglades back in pioneer days.</i>

1206
01:32:49,273 --> 01:32:52,227
African people run off from slaveholders...

1207
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,187
...hooked up with them...

1208
01:32:54,278 --> 01:32:56,437
...married up, had children.

1209
01:32:57,698 --> 01:33:00,450
When the Spanish gave up Florida...

1210
01:33:00,534 --> 01:33:04,117
<i>...the U.S. Army come down</i>
<i>to move all the Indian people to Oklahoma.</i>

1211
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,824
<i>A couple of them held out.</i>

1212
01:33:06,207 --> 01:33:08,365
That man, John Horse...

1213
01:33:08,459 --> 01:33:10,950
...his friend, Wildcat, another fella named...

1214
01:33:11,045 --> 01:33:12,373
<i>...Osceola...</i>

1215
01:33:12,588 --> 01:33:14,248
<i>...formed a fighting band...</i>

1216
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:17,294
...held out for another 10, 15 years...

1217
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,674
...and beat zach Taylor and 1,000 troops
at Lake Okeechobee.

1218
01:33:23,599 --> 01:33:25,224
So they stayed in Florida?

1219
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:28,346
One night they packed up,
rode out to Mexico.

1220
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,683
Men went to work
for General Santa Anna down there.

1221
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:38,654
After the Civil War they came north
to Texas, put up at Fort Duncan...

1222
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:43,402
...and the men joined what was called
the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts.

1223
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:44,823
The best trackers...

1224
01:33:44,912 --> 01:33:48,696
<i>...on either side of the border.</i>
<i>They chased after bandits...</i>

1225
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:52,951
...rustlers, Texas rednecks,
Kiowas, Comanches....

1226
01:33:53,546 --> 01:33:55,752
They fought against the Indians?

1227
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,417
Just like they did in Mexico.

1228
01:33:57,508 --> 01:33:59,299
But they were Indians themselves.

1229
01:34:00,219 --> 01:34:01,962
They were in the Army...

1230
01:34:02,221 --> 01:34:03,715
...like your father.

1231
01:34:06,809 --> 01:34:08,469
You know who I am?

1232
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:12,389
I got a pretty good guess.

1233
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:14,638
That guy who got shot.

1234
01:34:15,818 --> 01:34:18,523
You didn't go telling your father
you were here?

1235
01:34:18,696 --> 01:34:20,024
Are you kidding?

1236
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:22,358
And face a court-martial?

1237
01:34:24,952 --> 01:34:26,197
Pretty tough old man.

1238
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:28,614
Every time he moves up a rank...

1239
01:34:28,706 --> 01:34:31,707
<i>...he tightens the screws a little more.</i>
<i>Just 'cause....</i>

1240
01:34:32,918 --> 01:34:34,745
You know, he didn't have....

1241
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,505
Didn't have a father.

1242
01:34:40,176 --> 01:34:42,168
He's still pissed off about it.

1243
01:34:44,388 --> 01:34:46,132
When you're his age...

1244
01:34:47,558 --> 01:34:50,227
...you'll still be pissed off about him.

1245
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,231
How come you got into this?

1246
01:34:59,195 --> 01:35:00,938
These are our people.

1247
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:05,440
There are Paynes in Florida,
Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--

1248
01:35:06,285 --> 01:35:07,566
So I'm part Indian?

1249
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:09,739
By blood you are.

1250
01:35:11,207 --> 01:35:13,116
But blood only means what you let it.

1251
01:35:13,793 --> 01:35:17,790
My father says from the day you're born
you start from scratch.

1252
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:19,621
No breaks.

1253
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:20,830
<i>No excuses.</i>

1254
01:35:22,927 --> 01:35:25,169
You got to pull yourself up on your own.

1255
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:28,464
He's living proof of that, son.

1256
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:32,137
Living proof.

1257
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:41,813
'Morning, Hollis.

1258
01:35:41,988 --> 01:35:43,019
Sam!

1259
01:35:43,114 --> 01:35:44,394
Sit down.

1260
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,692
Big to-do the other day.

1261
01:35:49,036 --> 01:35:51,408
Meant a lot to folks you said something.

1262
01:35:52,248 --> 01:35:54,287
You thought anymore about our murder?

1263
01:35:56,168 --> 01:36:00,036
I wish I could tell you I remembered
something new, but I can't.

1264
01:36:03,426 --> 01:36:05,751
Well, I got an idea what happened.

1265
01:36:06,137 --> 01:36:07,168
You do?

1266
01:36:09,765 --> 01:36:13,893
I think somewhere between
Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house...

1267
01:36:13,978 --> 01:36:16,136
...Wade ran into Buddy Deeds.

1268
01:36:17,106 --> 01:36:19,264
I think Buddy put a bullet in him.

1269
01:36:19,608 --> 01:36:23,108
<i>Waited for him to die,</i>
<i>threw him in the trunk of the sheriff's car...</i>

1270
01:36:23,195 --> 01:36:25,651
<i>...and drove him out by Fort McKenzie.</i>

1271
01:36:27,158 --> 01:36:31,155
I think he buried him under four feet
of sand and never looked back.

1272
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:38,122
You lived in the man's house, how long?

1273
01:36:39,128 --> 01:36:40,955
17, 18 years...

1274
01:36:42,298 --> 01:36:45,382
...but didn't get to know him
any better than that.

1275
01:36:46,385 --> 01:36:49,339
I got to go see somebody
up in San Antonio.

1276
01:36:51,599 --> 01:36:53,924
Now, your memory gets any better...

1277
01:36:54,143 --> 01:36:56,136
...I'll be back tonight.

1278
01:37:10,201 --> 01:37:11,909
She finally got up.

1279
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:14,698
It's Saturday.

1280
01:37:15,206 --> 01:37:16,997
You got in late last night.

1281
01:37:17,416 --> 01:37:18,827
I had some...

1282
01:37:19,752 --> 01:37:21,626
...some school business.

1283
01:37:24,215 --> 01:37:25,460
Could I get this?

1284
01:37:27,218 --> 01:37:28,297
Paloma.

1285
01:37:28,678 --> 01:37:30,800
Nobody really wears that stuff.

1286
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:34,347
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school
and wore a uniform.

1287
01:37:34,433 --> 01:37:36,759
I only went for my last two years.

1288
01:37:37,228 --> 01:37:38,556
How come?

1289
01:37:40,773 --> 01:37:43,394
My mother wanted
to keep me away from...

1290
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:47,398
...from boys.

1291
01:37:48,322 --> 01:37:49,651
Did it work?

1292
01:37:53,494 --> 01:37:56,697
Longhorns go for 10 times the price.

1293
01:37:58,165 --> 01:38:00,917
But longhorns are hard
to come by these days.

1294
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:03,420
Sell much out here?

1295
01:38:04,005 --> 01:38:06,959
How am I going to sell things?
Nobody comes around.

1296
01:38:07,299 --> 01:38:09,043
This stretch of road...

1297
01:38:09,135 --> 01:38:11,423
...runs between Nowhere and...

1298
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,638
...Not Much Else.

1299
01:38:14,432 --> 01:38:16,590
A hell of a spot to put a business.

1300
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,516
Don't see much competition, do you?

1301
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:23,185
Used to sell these things like hotcakes.

1302
01:38:23,274 --> 01:38:24,436
Now...

1303
01:38:24,859 --> 01:38:28,192
...if it can't play those disks,
they won't look at it.

1304
01:38:29,530 --> 01:38:31,024
I like it here.

1305
01:38:31,991 --> 01:38:34,743
Once I tried going
onto the reservation to live.

1306
01:38:34,827 --> 01:38:36,618
Couldn't take the politics.

1307
01:38:36,704 --> 01:38:39,539
Damn Indians will drive you crazy
with that.

1308
01:38:42,585 --> 01:38:45,954
Now, your father,
this wasn't what he had in mind.

1309
01:38:47,298 --> 01:38:48,958
He come out of Korea...

1310
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:51,926
...bought a Chevy with too much engine.

1311
01:38:52,386 --> 01:38:57,179
Used to come roaring up and down
this road all hours of the day and night...

1312
01:38:57,433 --> 01:38:59,509
...looking for somebody to race.

1313
01:39:05,024 --> 01:39:06,020
Here.

1314
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,984
Buffalo chips.

1315
01:39:09,528 --> 01:39:11,320
<i>A fella down in Santa Fe told me...</i>

1316
01:39:11,405 --> 01:39:15,154
...he sells these as fast
as a buffalo can squeeze them out.

1317
01:39:21,123 --> 01:39:23,793
You think he killed anybody in Korea?

1318
01:39:25,044 --> 01:39:28,876
They don't hand those medals out
for hiding in your foxhole.

1319
01:39:31,759 --> 01:39:33,218
Would you buy this?

1320
01:39:35,554 --> 01:39:36,503
No.

1321
01:39:37,807 --> 01:39:39,716
Yeah, neither would I.

1322
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,265
If he hadn't found the deputy's job...

1323
01:39:45,398 --> 01:39:49,941
...I believe Buddy might've gone down
the other path, got into serious trouble.

1324
01:39:50,444 --> 01:39:52,236
It settled him right down.

1325
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:54,065
That and your mother.

1326
01:39:58,244 --> 01:40:00,616
Of course, he had that other one later.

1327
01:40:10,256 --> 01:40:11,833
He had another woman?

1328
01:40:13,718 --> 01:40:17,632
Your mother was not one
to be chased off her patch.

1329
01:40:18,306 --> 01:40:20,797
Half the damn county knew about it.

1330
01:40:21,642 --> 01:40:25,011
Nobody thought the worse of her
for seeing it through.

1331
01:40:25,104 --> 01:40:26,729
You know who it was?

1332
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:28,810
The other one?

1333
01:40:29,567 --> 01:40:30,432
At my age...

1334
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:32,354
<i>...you learn a new name...</i>

1335
01:40:32,445 --> 01:40:34,437
...you got to forget an old one.

1336
01:40:34,947 --> 01:40:35,943
Here.

1337
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:41,901
This big fella was sleeping
in a crate at Cisco's junkyard.

1338
01:40:42,413 --> 01:40:45,580
When I was going to open
to see what was in her...

1339
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:48,033
...jumped right at my face.

1340
01:40:49,086 --> 01:40:52,502
Scared me so bad I had to kill him
without thinking.

1341
01:40:53,007 --> 01:40:56,791
Be careful where you go poking.
Who knows what you'll find.

1342
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,377
Private Johnson...

1343
01:41:40,096 --> 01:41:42,302
...are you unhappy...

1344
01:41:43,182 --> 01:41:44,297
...in the Army?

1345
01:41:44,517 --> 01:41:45,631
No, sir.

1346
01:41:47,144 --> 01:41:49,267
Then how would you explain...

1347
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,686
...that out of 120 people...

1348
01:41:51,816 --> 01:41:53,725
...you were the only one...

1349
01:41:53,818 --> 01:41:56,106
<i>...who tested positive for drugs?</i>

1350
01:41:56,195 --> 01:41:57,737
I'm sorry, sir.

1351
01:42:00,074 --> 01:42:02,909
When you were given
the opportunity to enlist...

1352
01:42:03,369 --> 01:42:06,619
...a kind of contract was agreed upon.

1353
01:42:06,706 --> 01:42:09,541
I think the Army has honored its part...

1354
01:42:09,667 --> 01:42:10,912
...of that agreement.

1355
01:42:11,002 --> 01:42:11,997
Yes, sir.

1356
01:42:12,128 --> 01:42:14,797
Do you believe in what we do
in here, Private?

1357
01:42:15,423 --> 01:42:17,296
I can do the job, sir.

1358
01:42:24,348 --> 01:42:27,848
What exactly do you think your job is?

1359
01:42:30,062 --> 01:42:32,470
Follow orders, do whatever they say.

1360
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:33,888
Who's "they"?

1361
01:42:35,026 --> 01:42:36,568
The officers.

1362
01:42:36,652 --> 01:42:38,194
And that's the job?

1363
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:41,402
Nothing about serving your country?

1364
01:42:44,368 --> 01:42:47,120
These are not trick questions,
Private Johnson.

1365
01:42:47,538 --> 01:42:48,997
You'll get an Article 15...

1366
01:42:49,081 --> 01:42:52,284
<i>...and we'll go through the process</i>
<i>one way or another.</i>

1367
01:42:52,918 --> 01:42:55,326
I'm just trying to understand...

1368
01:42:56,714 --> 01:42:59,039
...how someone like you thinks.

1369
01:43:00,217 --> 01:43:02,009
You really want to know?

1370
01:43:02,178 --> 01:43:03,173
Please.

1371
01:43:05,681 --> 01:43:09,679
It's their country. This is one
of the best deals they offer.

1372
01:43:12,188 --> 01:43:14,513
How do you think I got to be a colonel?

1373
01:43:14,899 --> 01:43:17,472
Being good at your job.
Doing what they tell you.

1374
01:43:17,568 --> 01:43:18,979
Do what they tell you?

1375
01:43:19,070 --> 01:43:21,109
I mean, follow orders, sir.

1376
01:43:25,576 --> 01:43:27,901
With your attitude, Private...

1377
01:43:28,746 --> 01:43:31,202
...I'm surprised you want to stay
in the service.

1378
01:43:31,749 --> 01:43:32,947
I do, sir.

1379
01:43:33,709 --> 01:43:35,038
Because it's a job?

1380
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:39,871
Outside it's such a mess. It's....

1381
01:43:44,637 --> 01:43:45,586
Chaos.

1382
01:43:48,933 --> 01:43:50,392
Why do you think...

1383
01:43:52,436 --> 01:43:54,762
...they let us in on the deal?

1384
01:43:58,401 --> 01:44:03,063
'Cause they got people to fight:
Arabs, yellow people, whatever.

1385
01:44:03,155 --> 01:44:04,947
Might as well use us.

1386
01:44:12,581 --> 01:44:14,574
It works like this, Private.

1387
01:44:15,418 --> 01:44:18,869
Every soldier in the war
doesn't have to believe...

1388
01:44:19,338 --> 01:44:21,247
...in what he's fighting for.

1389
01:44:22,049 --> 01:44:26,510
Most of them fight just to back up
the other soldiers in their squad.

1390
01:44:27,763 --> 01:44:29,756
You try not to get them killed.

1391
01:44:29,849 --> 01:44:32,256
You try not to get them extra duty.

1392
01:44:32,601 --> 01:44:35,057
You try not embarrass yourself...

1393
01:44:35,855 --> 01:44:37,349
...in front of them.

1394
01:44:51,412 --> 01:44:53,405
Why don't you start with that?

1395
01:44:54,415 --> 01:44:55,494
Yes, sir.

1396
01:44:59,837 --> 01:45:01,000
Dismissed.

1397
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,299
Thank you, sir.

1398
01:45:33,871 --> 01:45:34,784
ANSELMA:

1399
01:45:40,586 --> 01:45:44,999
<i>Fred Zenito for Pager</i>
<i>and the Aggies jump to a 1 4-point lead.</i>

1400
01:45:45,132 --> 01:45:47,458
<i>Sooners back to punt on their own 27.</i>

1401
01:45:48,844 --> 01:45:53,471
Longhorns are going to kick some serious
butt this Saturday. You just watch.

1402
01:45:53,808 --> 01:45:57,888
We got a kid, a tailback from
down your way, out of El Indio--

1403
01:45:58,437 --> 01:45:59,979
That's in Maverick County.

1404
01:46:00,564 --> 01:46:02,059
Right, and you're in?

1405
01:46:02,149 --> 01:46:03,181
In Rio.

1406
01:46:03,442 --> 01:46:05,269
This kid, Hosea Brown...

1407
01:46:05,361 --> 01:46:06,855
...he does the 40 in 3.4.

1408
01:46:06,946 --> 01:46:09,698
Soft hands, lateral movement,
the whole package.

1409
01:46:09,782 --> 01:46:12,355
- Only a sophomore.
- Still go to all the home games?

1410
01:46:12,451 --> 01:46:16,449
Daddy's got his box in the stadium
and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games.

1411
01:46:16,914 --> 01:46:19,370
<i>And Friday nights there's high school.</i>

1412
01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:23,123
Churchill's got this boy, 6 foot 6,
310, moves like a cat.

1413
01:46:23,295 --> 01:46:26,830
High school, we're talking.
Guess how much he can bench-press?

1414
01:46:27,299 --> 01:46:28,628
Bunny, you....

1415
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,051
You on that same medication?

1416
01:46:31,304 --> 01:46:33,130
- Why, do I seem jumpy?
- No.

1417
01:46:33,472 --> 01:46:35,714
You look good. I was just wondering.

1418
01:46:36,183 --> 01:46:39,884
Last year was awful with Mama
passing on and this business with O.J.

1419
01:46:39,979 --> 01:46:41,888
<i>It's not Don Meredith or...</i>

1420
01:46:41,981 --> 01:46:45,065
...one of our boys,
but it kind of threw me for a loop.

1421
01:46:45,318 --> 01:46:46,598
You look good.

1422
01:46:47,153 --> 01:46:49,774
Then that squeaker,
the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma.

1423
01:46:49,864 --> 01:46:53,992
That son of a bitch stepped in some
lucky shit before he kicked that goal.

1424
01:46:54,368 --> 01:46:58,152
If they hadn't pulled me off that woman,
I'd have jerked a knot in her.

1425
01:46:59,832 --> 01:47:01,374
Were you in a fight?

1426
01:47:02,376 --> 01:47:04,665
Daddy calls it an altercation.

1427
01:47:05,463 --> 01:47:07,751
How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.

1428
01:47:08,382 --> 01:47:11,004
No, I'm the same weight I always was.

1429
01:47:12,386 --> 01:47:15,506
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job.
Says so himself:

1430
01:47:15,723 --> 01:47:18,926
<i>"Even my son-in-law was better</i>
<i>than this pinhead I got now."</i>

1431
01:47:19,018 --> 01:47:20,133
Bunny....

1432
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,053
That stuff I left in the garage still there?

1433
01:47:26,567 --> 01:47:30,268
Least he never called me that.
With me it was always "high-strung."

1434
01:47:30,363 --> 01:47:33,981
"Bunny would've done something
with her life if she wasn't so high-strung."

1435
01:47:34,075 --> 01:47:35,699
Or "tightly wound."

1436
01:47:36,327 --> 01:47:38,865
You haven't had one of your fires,
have you?

1437
01:47:40,039 --> 01:47:43,906
The stuff I left in the garage,
some of it was my father's.

1438
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:46,667
Did you watch the draft this year?

1439
01:47:48,255 --> 01:47:51,541
Of course not. Idiot question.
They try to make it dramatic...

1440
01:47:51,634 --> 01:47:54,551
...like it's a surprise who picks who
in the first round...

1441
01:47:54,637 --> 01:47:58,966
...but they went over it for months
with their experts, computers...

1442
01:47:59,183 --> 01:48:02,184
...doctor's reports, coach's evaluations...

1443
01:48:02,353 --> 01:48:05,769
...highlight reels, psychological profiles....

1444
01:48:06,524 --> 01:48:11,351
I wouldn't be surprised if they collected
stool samples on them, had them analyzed.

1445
01:48:11,529 --> 01:48:12,940
All that to pick...

1446
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:15,237
...a football player for your squad.

1447
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:20,452
Compared to that, what you know about
a person when you get married to them...

1448
01:48:20,538 --> 01:48:22,993
...doesn't amount to diddly, does it?

1449
01:48:25,835 --> 01:48:27,543
No, I suppose not.

1450
01:48:28,045 --> 01:48:31,663
You kind of bought yourself
a pig in a poke, didn't you?

1451
01:48:32,717 --> 01:48:37,628
The whole time we were seeing each other,
you didn't know that I was tightly wound.

1452
01:48:38,014 --> 01:48:40,006
It wasn't just you, Bunny.

1453
01:48:41,058 --> 01:48:42,885
No, it wasn't, was it?

1454
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:47,853
You didn't exactly throw yourself
into it heart and soul.

1455
01:48:50,901 --> 01:48:54,484
Your shit's still in the garage,
if that's what you came for.

1456
01:49:06,751 --> 01:49:08,743
Three hundred and fifty pounds.

1457
01:49:12,715 --> 01:49:16,582
That boy Churchill's got.
He plays tackle both ways.

1458
01:49:19,096 --> 01:49:21,338
Bench-presses 350 pounds.

1459
01:49:24,226 --> 01:49:27,144
Imagine having that much weight on you,
pressing down.

1460
01:49:27,229 --> 01:49:29,899
Be hard to breathe, hard to swallow.

1461
01:49:31,275 --> 01:49:35,189
I think they have another fella there
to keep it off your chest.

1462
01:49:37,239 --> 01:49:38,402
A spotter.

1463
01:49:39,492 --> 01:49:42,991
"I only got my little girl now," he says.

1464
01:49:43,204 --> 01:49:44,912
"She's my lifeline."

1465
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:50,740
Then he says I can't sit in the box anymore
if I don't control myself.

1466
01:49:51,253 --> 01:49:52,285
Son of a bitch!

1467
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:55,464
<i>He doesn't even watch the games,</i>
<i>just sits there drinking.</i>

1468
01:49:55,549 --> 01:49:57,209
Looks up at the TV now and then.

1469
01:49:57,301 --> 01:50:01,002
I'd be better off in the cheap seats
with some real football people.

1470
01:50:01,889 --> 01:50:03,549
You look good, Bunny.

1471
01:50:04,976 --> 01:50:06,767
It was nice to see you.

1472
01:50:09,438 --> 01:50:10,434
Thanks.

1473
01:50:12,316 --> 01:50:14,807
I like it when you say that, Sam.

1474
01:50:40,177 --> 01:50:41,755
"Dearest Buddy."

1475
01:50:52,773 --> 01:50:54,481
Hey, it's the general.

1476
01:50:56,193 --> 01:50:58,482
Colonel. Is Otis in?

1477
01:50:58,654 --> 01:51:00,314
- Come on in.
- If it's too late--

1478
01:51:00,406 --> 01:51:01,651
Come on in.

1479
01:51:10,291 --> 01:51:14,620
Otis is sitting up with some people
at the club. I don't think he'll be long.

1480
01:51:22,762 --> 01:51:25,846
His hot sauce recipe
won a contest last year.

1481
01:51:26,265 --> 01:51:28,009
They're selling it as far away...

1482
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:29,476
...as San Antonio.

1483
01:51:30,478 --> 01:51:33,016
You've been in this house for a while?

1484
01:51:33,773 --> 01:51:38,150
I've been here with him eight years.
He built it when he was with Leora.

1485
01:51:39,111 --> 01:51:40,487
Never met her.

1486
01:51:41,322 --> 01:51:43,647
There's a bunch of them you never met.

1487
01:51:43,824 --> 01:51:45,484
Well, me neither.

1488
01:51:47,328 --> 01:51:49,653
Let me show you around.

1489
01:52:04,804 --> 01:52:08,173
He got into this cowboys-and-Indians stuff
a while back.

1490
01:52:08,474 --> 01:52:10,016
Spent half his time poking...

1491
01:52:10,101 --> 01:52:12,508
...around the library, way up to Austin.

1492
01:52:33,332 --> 01:52:35,372
Kind of like a shrine, isn't it?

1493
01:52:37,545 --> 01:52:39,584
Where did he get all this stuff?

1494
01:52:39,755 --> 01:52:41,712
Your mother's got a brother, Alphonse.

1495
01:52:42,591 --> 01:52:43,457
Uncle Al.

1496
01:52:43,551 --> 01:52:47,383
Otis stood on good terms
with him. Whenever you make the news...

1497
01:52:47,513 --> 01:52:48,888
...he sends it on.

1498
01:52:49,557 --> 01:52:51,514
When they made you general...

1499
01:52:51,726 --> 01:52:54,513
...Otis almost drove away
our customers going on about it.

1500
01:52:54,603 --> 01:52:55,932
I'm a colonel.

1501
01:52:56,522 --> 01:52:57,518
I know.

1502
01:52:58,190 --> 01:53:01,061
The man made me memorize
the whole Army chain of command...

1503
01:53:01,152 --> 01:53:02,860
...before he'd marry me.

1504
01:53:06,991 --> 01:53:09,743
My mother said that
he never asked about me.

1505
01:53:11,162 --> 01:53:12,822
He never asked her.

1506
01:53:23,466 --> 01:53:25,043
Tell him I stopped by?

1507
01:53:25,676 --> 01:53:26,755
Thanks.

1508
01:53:31,265 --> 01:53:32,546
Catch you later...

1509
01:53:34,393 --> 01:53:35,556
...Colonel.

1510
01:53:43,611 --> 01:53:44,560
JAIME:

1511
01:53:53,245 --> 01:53:54,159
ENRIQUE:

1512
01:54:01,629 --> 01:54:02,542
ANSELMA:

1513
01:54:08,344 --> 01:54:10,420
<i>Señora Cruz.</i>

1514
01:54:12,264 --> 01:54:13,379
Who is it?

1515
01:54:17,311 --> 01:54:20,312
What are you doing out here?
Are you crazy?

1516
01:54:24,694 --> 01:54:27,363
In English. We're in the United States.

1517
01:54:27,613 --> 01:54:31,362
I have some friends
and they have had an accident.

1518
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:35,151
- You have somebody else out there?
- We was...

1519
01:54:35,246 --> 01:54:38,994
...by the river and I heard my friend
calling for help...

1520
01:54:39,542 --> 01:54:40,917
<i>...and I look...</i>

1521
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:43,370
...and she has fallen in the water.

1522
01:54:43,462 --> 01:54:45,455
Don't tell me lies. What happened?

1523
01:54:47,133 --> 01:54:49,291
We was crossing the river.

1524
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:56,800
What are you doing out there?

1525
01:54:56,934 --> 01:54:59,306
Wait. Who are they?
Why bring them here?

1526
01:54:59,562 --> 01:55:01,104
I need help, <i>señora</i>.

1527
01:55:06,736 --> 01:55:09,772
I'll call Border Patrol.
They'll get her to the hospital.

1528
01:55:09,864 --> 01:55:10,860
ENRIQUE:

1529
01:55:11,365 --> 01:55:13,773
You think you're doing
these people a favor?

1530
01:55:13,868 --> 01:55:16,619
What are they going to do?
They get on welfare...

1531
01:55:16,704 --> 01:55:18,531
...or they become criminals.

1532
01:55:44,690 --> 01:55:46,647
This girl is a friend of yours?

1533
01:55:48,653 --> 01:55:50,147
I thought you were married.

1534
01:55:50,363 --> 01:55:54,574
I am married to the cousin of a friend
but only to live here.

1535
01:55:55,034 --> 01:55:56,825
This is the mother of my child.

1536
01:55:58,663 --> 01:55:59,694
Typical.

1537
01:56:10,132 --> 01:56:11,212
Homework?

1538
01:56:13,010 --> 01:56:14,552
I finished that.

1539
01:56:14,845 --> 01:56:16,505
I'm just messing around.

1540
01:56:20,685 --> 01:56:21,799
Tanks, huh?

1541
01:56:22,478 --> 01:56:23,806
Yeah, well....

1542
01:56:24,271 --> 01:56:27,937
If you've got to be in the Army,
better to have something slick to drive.

1543
01:56:28,025 --> 01:56:29,021
So....

1544
01:56:30,277 --> 01:56:32,021
You're going in the Army?

1545
01:56:34,782 --> 01:56:36,905
That's the general plan, isn't it?

1546
01:56:42,331 --> 01:56:43,825
That's up to you.

1547
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,079
The Army isn't for everybody.

1548
01:56:57,346 --> 01:57:00,181
It's not that I think
you wouldn't be good at it.

1549
01:57:00,683 --> 01:57:01,846
<i>You know....</i>

1550
01:57:04,145 --> 01:57:08,557
I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided
to do something else with your life.

1551
01:57:11,319 --> 01:57:12,350
You wouldn't?

1552
01:57:14,822 --> 01:57:15,771
No.

1553
01:57:24,123 --> 01:57:25,238
So....

1554
01:57:27,001 --> 01:57:28,993
How's your room shaping up?

1555
01:57:30,629 --> 01:57:32,788
It's fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

1556
01:57:32,882 --> 01:57:34,044
Good.

1557
01:57:39,388 --> 01:57:41,345
Are we ever going to see your father?

1558
01:57:41,891 --> 01:57:43,053
My father?

1559
01:57:43,392 --> 01:57:44,637
He lives here, right?

1560
01:57:44,727 --> 01:57:45,890
Yes, he does.

1561
01:57:52,735 --> 01:57:54,229
Maybe we'll....

1562
01:57:54,904 --> 01:57:57,821
We'll fix that thing out back and have...

1563
01:57:58,240 --> 01:57:59,272
...a barbecue.

1564
01:57:59,992 --> 01:58:01,652
<i>We could invite him and...</i>

1565
01:58:01,744 --> 01:58:03,404
...and his wife over.

1566
01:58:06,624 --> 01:58:08,451
He makes his own sauce.

1567
01:58:19,845 --> 01:58:20,675
ELADIO:

1568
01:59:07,059 --> 01:59:09,182
<i>Let's go! Hurry up!</i>

1569
01:59:09,895 --> 01:59:12,351
Everybody in the world will see.

1570
01:59:15,151 --> 01:59:16,978
He was a doctor on the other side.

1571
01:59:18,904 --> 01:59:20,315
Don't worry about it.

1572
01:59:21,782 --> 01:59:23,609
He owes me a few favors.

1573
01:59:29,457 --> 01:59:32,244
In English, Enrique. In English!

1574
01:59:38,799 --> 01:59:39,831
Hollis!

1575
01:59:44,013 --> 01:59:45,009
Hollis!

1576
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:48,808
You in there?

1577
02:00:13,626 --> 02:00:14,622
Fellas.

1578
02:00:22,635 --> 02:00:24,129
You're open late.

1579
02:00:24,887 --> 02:00:27,639
I'm not open. We're just talking.

1580
02:00:35,314 --> 02:00:37,307
So, Hollis probably told you.

1581
02:00:37,942 --> 02:00:39,816
We found Charlie Wade.

1582
02:00:40,778 --> 02:00:42,272
Is that right?

1583
02:00:43,406 --> 02:00:46,857
Start digging holes in this county,
no telling what'll come up.

1584
02:00:48,828 --> 02:00:50,737
You two saw it, didn't you?

1585
02:00:53,666 --> 02:00:56,157
You two saw it when Buddy killed him.

1586
02:01:00,172 --> 02:01:02,663
I'm going to find out one way or the other.

1587
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:06,337
Your father had the finest sense
of justice...

1588
02:01:06,512 --> 02:01:08,469
...of any man I've ever known.

1589
02:01:08,973 --> 02:01:10,965
And my mother was a saint.

1590
02:01:13,185 --> 02:01:15,937
For 15 years the whole damn town...

1591
02:01:16,272 --> 02:01:18,941
...knew he had another woman on the side.

1592
02:01:22,528 --> 02:01:25,233
He stole $10,000
and set her up in business...

1593
02:01:25,364 --> 02:01:27,108
...but hell, what's that?

1594
02:01:27,867 --> 02:01:30,192
You got a problem, old Buddy'll fix it.

1595
02:01:30,703 --> 02:01:32,909
You facing some time in jail?

1596
02:01:33,122 --> 02:01:37,202
Buddy'll knock half of it off,
if you do what he says when he says.

1597
02:01:38,461 --> 02:01:41,082
You got some business
that's not exactly legal?

1598
02:01:41,172 --> 02:01:42,370
Just talk to Buddy.

1599
02:01:42,465 --> 02:01:43,496
Buddy Deeds--

1600
02:01:43,591 --> 02:01:45,418
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.

1601
02:01:47,386 --> 02:01:48,845
That night at the cafe...

1602
02:01:49,221 --> 02:01:52,388
...he didn't stay long after you left,
did he, Hollis?

1603
02:01:53,643 --> 02:01:56,679
Maybe he'd decided
he'd gone too far with Wade.

1604
02:01:56,771 --> 02:02:00,187
He figured he'd better not wait
for the sheriff to get behind him.

1605
02:02:00,274 --> 02:02:02,896
So he stepped out to see
if he could catch up...

1606
02:02:06,364 --> 02:02:08,855
...and you were here that night...

1607
02:02:09,450 --> 02:02:11,158
...weren't you, "O"?

1608
02:02:13,079 --> 02:02:14,359
I was here.

1609
02:02:17,875 --> 02:02:21,209
I'd been running a game
on the side after hours.

1610
02:02:23,047 --> 02:02:24,292
Craps.

1611
02:02:25,007 --> 02:02:27,249
Draw poker on the weekends.

1612
02:02:28,803 --> 02:02:30,961
Roderick didn't know about it.

1613
02:02:31,847 --> 02:02:33,342
More important...

1614
02:02:33,933 --> 02:02:36,602
...Charlie Wade didn't know about it...

1615
02:02:36,978 --> 02:02:39,978
...'cause I didn't want to cut him in on it.

1616
02:02:41,732 --> 02:02:44,899
I was pretty full of myself
back in those days.

1617
02:02:46,112 --> 02:02:49,896
Hell, I just didn't expect the man so early.

1618
02:05:01,163 --> 02:05:02,112
Wade!

1619
02:05:48,085 --> 02:05:51,786
Sheriff Charlie was the whip hand
for old Judge Tibbs...

1620
02:05:52,173 --> 02:05:55,043
<i>...who pretty much owned</i>
<i>this county back then.</i>

1621
02:05:56,093 --> 02:05:58,002
<i>If the truth came out...</i>

1622
02:05:58,638 --> 02:06:01,307
<i>...he wasn't going to go easy on Hollis.</i>

1623
02:06:03,851 --> 02:06:06,603
I don't know why I trusted Buddy with it...

1624
02:06:08,022 --> 02:06:10,145
...don't know why he trusted me.

1625
02:06:13,527 --> 02:06:15,354
The first time I talked with him...

1626
02:06:15,446 --> 02:06:17,486
...was right there and then...

1627
02:06:18,491 --> 02:06:22,488
...with a dead white man leaking blood
on the floor between us.

1628
02:06:23,037 --> 02:06:26,987
The three of us cleaned up
and took him out by the post...

1629
02:06:27,708 --> 02:06:29,250
...and put him under.

1630
02:06:30,503 --> 02:06:32,495
I can't say I was much help.

1631
02:06:33,047 --> 02:06:34,874
And the $10,000?

1632
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:37,377
Widow's benefits.

1633
02:06:38,094 --> 02:06:40,929
He figured it'd make
the disappearance look better.

1634
02:06:41,055 --> 02:06:44,839
And Mercedes was scraping by
after Charlie killed her man.

1635
02:06:46,352 --> 02:06:47,597
Buddy and her...

1636
02:06:47,687 --> 02:06:49,893
<i>...didn't get hooked up until later.</i>

1637
02:06:50,773 --> 02:06:52,600
Time went on...

1638
02:06:52,692 --> 02:06:54,768
...people liked the story we told...

1639
02:06:54,860 --> 02:06:57,482
...better than what the truth
might have been.

1640
02:06:58,698 --> 02:07:00,358
It's your call, Sam.

1641
02:07:02,368 --> 02:07:05,369
I don't think the Rangers are likely to...

1642
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:08,665
...find out any more
than they already know.

1643
02:07:11,752 --> 02:07:13,412
And as for me...

1644
02:07:16,882 --> 02:07:19,718
...it's just one of your unsolved mysteries.

1645
02:07:28,978 --> 02:07:31,433
Word gets out who the body was...

1646
02:07:32,523 --> 02:07:34,646
...people'll think Buddy done it.

1647
02:07:37,945 --> 02:07:39,938
Buddy's a goddamn legend.

1648
02:07:41,782 --> 02:07:43,407
He can handle it.

1649
02:07:49,582 --> 02:07:51,076
'Night, fellas.

1650
02:08:19,028 --> 02:08:21,021
When does the picture start?

1651
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:27,699
Are you going to tell your mother
we've been seeing each other?

1652
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:30,327
She'll find out sooner or later.

1653
02:08:30,498 --> 02:08:34,116
I don't have to ask permission anymore,
if that's what you mean.

1654
02:08:40,174 --> 02:08:42,712
You have any idea when your father died?

1655
02:08:42,802 --> 02:08:43,797
Eladio?

1656
02:08:45,137 --> 02:08:47,426
Couple of months before I was born.

1657
02:08:50,017 --> 02:08:52,093
Try a year and half.

1658
02:09:11,831 --> 02:09:15,875
Buddy bought the cafe for her
with money he took from the county.

1659
02:09:19,630 --> 02:09:21,670
They can't pull this on me.

1660
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,211
It's not fair.

1661
02:09:29,557 --> 02:09:31,134
I don't believe this.

1662
02:09:38,524 --> 02:09:41,442
He paid the hospital bill
when you were born.

1663
02:09:44,822 --> 02:09:46,102
Your mother...

1664
02:09:47,074 --> 02:09:48,983
...she always called you...

1665
02:09:49,452 --> 02:09:51,278
..."a beautiful daughter"...

1666
02:09:52,413 --> 02:09:54,619
...in the letters she wrote to him.

1667
02:10:01,839 --> 02:10:04,591
From the first time I saw you at school...

1668
02:10:14,393 --> 02:10:18,094
...all those years we were married
to other people, I always felt...

1669
02:10:19,190 --> 02:10:21,099
...like we were connected.

1670
02:10:26,030 --> 02:10:27,773
I remember thinking...

1671
02:10:29,450 --> 02:10:31,822
...you were the one part of my life...

1672
02:10:32,703 --> 02:10:34,910
...that Buddy didn't have a piece of.

1673
02:10:36,082 --> 02:10:38,370
I can't have any more children.

1674
02:10:39,043 --> 02:10:41,285
After Amado, I had complications.

1675
02:10:41,379 --> 02:10:44,961
I can't get pregnant anymore,
if that's what the rule is about.

1676
02:10:49,053 --> 02:10:50,381
So that's it?

1677
02:10:52,723 --> 02:10:55,214
You won't want to be with me anymore?

1678
02:10:58,854 --> 02:11:00,313
If I met you...

1679
02:11:02,066 --> 02:11:04,189
...for the first time today...

1680
02:11:05,486 --> 02:11:07,562
...I'd still want to be with you.

1681
02:11:13,202 --> 02:11:15,029
Start from scratch?

1682
02:11:16,497 --> 02:11:17,446
Yeah.

1683
02:11:19,166 --> 02:11:22,037
All that other stuff and all that history...

1684
02:11:22,962 --> 02:11:24,753
...the hell with it, right?

1685
02:11:30,761 --> 02:11:32,339
Forget the Alamo.

1686
02:15:21,283 --> 02:15:24,403
