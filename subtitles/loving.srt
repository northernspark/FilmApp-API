00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,598
Bye-bye, my old lad,
and thanks for a smashing weekend.

5
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,992
Wonderful company, lovely food
and your wife makes love magnificently!

6
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,911
(Train horn)

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,794
Excuse me, sir, but did I hear you correctly?

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,108
What's that, old chap?

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,636
You've been a guest in that gentleman's house
for the weekend

10
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,474
and you tell him to his face
that his wife makes love magnificently?

11
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,595
Yes, that's right.

12
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,316
Do you think that's quite correct?

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,470
Well, no. Not exactly, no.

14
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,791
But he's such a nice chap,
I wouldn't like to say anything to offend him.

15
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,873
I say, that was rather thoughtful of you.

16
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,196
(Conductor whistles tune)

17
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,636
- Fare?
- Oh, very fair, I'd say.

18
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,156
Come on, come on. I ain't got all day.

19
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,196
Oh, um, Guildhall, please.

20
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,229
Fares, please. Any more fares, please?

21
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,634
<i>Fares, please.</i>

22
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,039
Going all the way?

23
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,636
Why don't you go down front, sir?
You'll see better.

24
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,512
Don't lie to me, Sidney Bliss. You were with
that woman Esme Crowfoot all evening.

25
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,752
I keep telling you, I only popped in for a bit.
Half an hour, that's all. That's not long.

26
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,159
That's long enough for you.

27
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,231
What've you been doing? Holding a stopwatch?

28
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,390
What were you doing going to her flat, anyway?

29
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,517
She's one of our clients, isn't she?
I have to vet 'em, don't I?

30
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,875
Oh, "vet"! Is that the new word for it?

31
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,636
I can't fix 'em up with the right partners
until I find out what they do and how... they live.

32
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,396
Like the young widow at the tobacconist?
You must have "vetted" her at least 50 times!

33
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,119
Oh, God,
I only keep going in there for my shag!

34
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,512
Look, it's my job to find out
what the female clients do.

35
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,556
<i>You</i> should look after the men.

36
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,198
Don't be stupid. I know what they do.

37
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,430
Oh, don't try and joke your way out of it.

38
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,557
What would you say if I started vetting
all the male clients?

39
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,393
- I'd say, "Gawd help 'em."
- You rotten beast!

40
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,354
- I've had enough!
- Sophie, it hurts!

41
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,396
<i>- Cut it out!</i>
<i>- I've had enough of you!</i>

42
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,436
<i>It's every night!</i>

43
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,796
<i>Sophie, it hurts.</i>
<i>Have you gone raving mad?</i>

44
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,950
(Doorbell chimes Here Comes The Bride)

45
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,915
Come in.

46
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,990
Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon.

47
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,550
That's all right, sir. We're not ashamed of
being in love, are we, sweetheart?

48
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,517
- No, dear.
- What can we do for you, sir?

49
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,718
Er, well, it's about your advert.
I was looking for a wife.

50
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,031
And you couldn't have come to a better place.
Could he, my little baby?

51
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,633
<i>No, indeed.</i>

52
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,759
Well, it looks as if I shall have to leave you
for a little while, darling.

53
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,957
Business before pleasure, my dove.
You'll excuse us, won't you?

54
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,519
<i>See you soon, sugar puff.</i>

55
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,275
I'll be counting the moments
till I can get at you again.

56
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,277
It's amazing. Ten years we've been married.
You'd never believe it.

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,033
Oh, wonderful. I wouldn't mind a wife like that.

58
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,192
Like that?
No, we'll find you something better than...

59
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,159
We'll find you something more suited to you.
Won't you sit down, Mr?

60
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,879
Oh, Muffet. Bertram Muffet.

61
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,953
Muffin. Well, we'll have to find you
a crumpet to go with that, won't we?

62
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,191
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind. Now, then, Mr Muffin...

63
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,236
- Er, Muffet.
- Muffet, yes.

64
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,356
Our charges, and very reasonable they are too,

65
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,035
are two guineas registration,
two for the introduction and two when you click.

66
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,872
- Click?
- Get married.

67
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,599
If you click without getting married,
it's four guineas.

68
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,193
Oh, yes, that's fine.

69
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,836
Bertram Muffin.

70
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,955
Muffet.

71
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,396
That's it, yes. We'll just get a few details. Age?

72
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,471
Oh, er, 17, I think.

73
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,391
17?

74
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,233
Well, I thought the younger she was,
the longer she'd last.

75
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,834
No, no, no. I want <i>your</i> details. <i>Your</i> age.

76
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,353
Oh, 27.

77
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,829
27. And what are you interested in?

78
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,638
Same as most chaps like to do, I suppose.

79
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,948
And that is?

80
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,031
Well, I don't know. I've never done it yet.

81
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,076
You should try it. It's lovely.

82
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,038
What I'm trying to do is
to find out what you like to do,

83
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,111
so I can fix you up with a girl who likes it, too.

84
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,839
Oh, yes, I would like a girl who likes it, too.

85
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,876
Yes, it is handy. Hobbies?

86
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,032
Oh, well,
my main one is making model aeroplanes.

87
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,917
Model aeroplanes?

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,753
- Yes, out of milk bottle tops.
- Milk bottle tops?

89
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,992
- Yes. They're not flying models, of course.
- No? You surprise me. Any other hobbies?

90
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,516
I rather like collecting book matches.
You know, all the different packets.

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,318
I don't think we'll have much trouble

92
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,349
finding you a girl that likes making aeroplanes
out of bottle tops and collecting the odd packet.

93
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,555
Oh, good.

94
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,790
Right, well, that's the lot.

95
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,519
Oh, wonderful. Er, what happens now?

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,556
Come with me.

97
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,758
Now, then.

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,991
All we do is feed the information
into the computer here,

99
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,232
and, after a few minutes,
the lady suitable to you will come out there.

100
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,152
What? Through that little slot?
She must be very small.

101
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,992
No, no, no.

102
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,878
Just the lady's particulars, not the lady herself.

103
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,756
This is a fantastic piece of machinery,
you know that? It cost a bomb.

104
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,673
This is a miracle of modern technology.
Here we go.

105
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,112
Bottle tops and book matches!

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,156
What a catch!

107
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,276
Ah! (Laughs)

108
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,399
Oh, yes. I think this is the <i>ideal</i> one, Mr Bliss.

109
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,516
Here we are, then.

110
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,556
Oh, gosh! That was quick.

111
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,108
- That's the beauty of it, you see, Mr Muffin.
- Muffet.

112
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,398
A fellow can spend his lifetime trying to find
the right girl. This machine does it in minutes.

113
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,232
Shall we see who the lucky lady is, then?

114
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,834
There's been a slight technical error here.

115
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,275
This one is definitely out of circulation.

116
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,036
What's the idea? Why her?

117
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,076
Why not? She's one of our clients.

118
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,675
- I know that, but she's no good.
- You seem to find her very satisfactory.

119
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,309
All right. You've had your little joke.
Let's have another one.

120
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,437
You seem to forget, Sidney, dear,
I didn't choose her,

121
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,398
it was chosen by
that miracle of modern technology.

122
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,916
Or perhaps you'd like me to explain
to our clients how it works.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,831
No, no, no.

124
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,916
We don't need you... darling.

125
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,276
I want to see that
the gentleman's fixed up properly, dear.

126
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,920
It's a pity about that, Mr Muffin, a great pity.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,151
- Oh, has your computer gone wrong?
- No, it's been too accurate.

128
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,630
- This lady's hobby is not compatible with yours.
- Oh, but how?

129
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,599
Well, she likes to make Christmas decorations
out of milk bottle tops.

130
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,070
That could lead to fights every morning
about who's going to have the top.

131
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,479
I'm sure we wouldn't.

132
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,552
It would bring your aircraft production
to a standstill.

133
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,155
Oh, nonsense, sweetheart.
I think it's a lovely idea.

134
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,870
Can't you just imagine these two young people
sitting in front of a fire every evening,

135
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,791
doing things with their tops?

136
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,758
I'm quite ready to have a go at it if she is,
Mr Bliss.

137
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,593
She's ready all right, mate...
to have a go, I mean.

138
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,636
Don't be a spoilsport, Sidney.

139
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,631
Her number's on the card. Let me call it.

140
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,676
I'll do it...

141
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,716
darling.

142
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,310
That's it. Now, hold it.

143
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,753
(Phone rings)

144
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,796
Oh, excuse me one moment, will you?

145
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,273
Esme Crowfoot speaking. Can I help you?

146
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,193
Oh, this is Mr Bliss of the Wedded Bliss Agency.

147
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,910
You've got a nerve calling me after the way
you behaved last night, I must say.

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,992
Yes, and I'm very sorry if I bothered you,
Miss Crowfoot.

149
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,311
The fact is we have a young gentleman here
who's very anxious to meet you.

150
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,710
Well, if he's anything like you,
I don't think I care to meet him, thank you.

151
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,836
She's all excited about it.

152
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,713
I don't know what you think I am,
or expect me to do,

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,396
but it'll take more than a dozen tired daffodils
to do it, I can assure you.

154
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,278
That's nice of you to say so.
We do our best to give satisfaction.

155
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,475
How about this evening?

156
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,678
- Yes, that's fine with Mr Muffin.
- Muffet.

157
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,832
How about the Parkway Cocktail Bar,
7:30 this evening?

158
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,078
Lovely. Fine. Yes, not at all. It's a pleasure.
You're very welcome.

159
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,116
That's that, then.

160
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,591
Two guineas registration, two guineas for
the introduction. That's four guineas altogether.

161
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,195
I'll give you one of our introductory cards,
so that she knows you come from us.

162
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,633
Oh, yes, thank you.

163
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,110
And you might like to have our little booklet,
giving a few tips on courtship,

164
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,156
a sort of Do-lt-Yourselves.

165
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind. There we are.

166
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,836
Thank you.

167
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,275
Oh, yes, thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

168
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,828
The Wit To Woo by Sidney Bliss. Interesting.

169
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,876
Yes, well, that's all, then.

170
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,394
And the very, very best of luck to you, Mr Muffet.

171
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,038
Er, Muffin. Erm...

172
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,678
Was there something else?

173
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,718
- Just my change. I gave you a five pound note.
- That's right.

174
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,669
There's two guineas registration, two for
the introduction and 16 bob for the booklet.

175
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,318
Oh. Oh, yes.

176
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,913
I... Yes. Oh, thank you.

177
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,558
Yes. Not at all. There we are.

178
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,313
Don't forget. Parkway Cocktail Bar, 7:30. Ta-ta.

179
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,191
Sophie. Sophie!

180
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,032
<i>Now, cut it out, Sophie!</i>

181
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,274
Well, Henry, you heard Mr Snooper's advice.

182
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,316
Do you think we should try it?

183
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,349
If you want to, Emily, but personally I don't think
a pair of steps is going to be the answer.

184
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,118
If I'm to help you sort out your problems,
I must insist on absolute candour.

185
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,832
Do not be afraid to use natural words
for natural functions.

186
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,595
<i>You won't easily shock me, I can promise you.</i>

187
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,832
So, let's have all the dirty linen out
and give it a jolly good washing, eh?

188
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,388
Now, who's going to be first? You, Mrs Dreery?

189
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,679
Well, really,
I suppose the trouble is we just can't get on.

190
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,958
Now, let's try to be more precise.
Get on... what? A horse? A bus?

191
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,751
Oh, no. You know.
Well, we just seem to have rows all the time.

192
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,308
Ah, rows, yes. About what, precisely?

193
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,871
Oh, everything. Like the way he went on
about that fireside chair I got him.

194
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,552
I think so, an' all. Look at it!

195
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,916
It must've been made for a bloody midget.
I couldn't get half my arse on it.

196
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,233
Hardly the cause for a row, Mr Dreery.

197
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,997
You must learn to turn the other cheek,
in a manner of speaking.

198
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,153
I didn't come here for a laugh, you know, mate.
I can stay at home and look at her for that.

199
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,678
Yes, well, there's usually some deeper,
underlying cause for stress in these cases.

200
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,716
Of course there is.

201
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,237
Let's face it.
You see, our problem is about our... sex.

202
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,518
You shouldn't have any trouble in that direction.
After all, you're one of each.

203
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,431
Some people are far worse off, you know.

204
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,353
- Are you trying to be funny, mate?
- No, no. Certainly not.

205
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,476
You don't seem to get the point, mate.

206
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,677
You see, the trouble with my wife is...

207
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,591
she won't have...

208
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,511
relations.

209
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,068
Oh, I think that's hardly fair, Mrs Dreery.

210
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,438
After all, it's perfectly normal to entertain
members of the family from time to time.

211
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,636
No, no, no, no, no.

212
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,472
She won't have...

213
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,748
...intercourse.

214
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,513
What?! Well, you must chat about something.

215
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,637
What he's trying to say is that we never have it.

216
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,592
That intimacy never takes place between us.

217
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,356
Ah, I see! Well, of course, you should have
mentioned that in the first place.

218
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,352
Obviously, that's the basic root of the problem.

219
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,317
<i>Yes. Well, of course.</i>

220
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,154
It naturally follows that everyone
should lead a well-balanced sex life.

221
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,437
That's the trouble: it isn't well balanced.

222
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,476
He's five stone heavier than me.

223
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,192
<i>Mm. Yes. Oh.</i>

224
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,273
I see. Yes, I can understand
the position you've been put on... put in.

225
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,749
Stone the crows. What's he talking about?

226
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,832
But don't you see?
At the moment, you are a dead weight.

227
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,433
And you're a bloody dead loss.

228
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,476
Don't talk to me like that!

229
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,471
Here I am, trying to help you...

230
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,552
Help me?
You couldn't help a dog find a bloody lamppost.

231
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,073
How dare you!

232
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,516
You come here using ridiculous words
like "relations" and "intercourse"

233
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,955
without having the <i>slightest</i> idea
what they mean!

234
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,838
I don't know what they mean?!
You're round the bleedin' twist!

235
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,992
That's it! Get out of my office, do you hear?
Get out!

236
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,719
We're getting out! Don't worry, mate!

237
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,318
Mr Snooper,
I must ask you to keep your voice down!

238
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,356
You can be heard all over the building.

239
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,352
I'm sorry. I was trying to give
this wretched couple some advice.

240
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,035
Advice? You couldn't advise a constipated cow
to take a laxative.

241
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,999
Sir, sir, if you and your wife
would care to wait outside,

242
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,036
I'll see you in a moment.

243
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,277
Snooper, these incidents are happening
far too often.

244
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,316
Well, I'm really very, very sorry, sir.

245
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,076
It's not all your fault. I shouldn't have employed
a bachelor to give advice to married couples.

246
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,835
But I know all about married couples.
My father and mother were one, you know.

247
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,115
I'm delighted to hear it, but it's not good enough.

248
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,034
Unless you're prepared to get married,
we'll have to dispense with your services.

249
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,715
- Is that understood?
- But I'm a confirmed bachelor.

250
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,756
I don't know any women.

251
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,196
Then find one!
Go to a matrimonial agency or something.

252
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,475
But do it. Soon.

253
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,476
Married? lt'll disrupt my entire life!

254
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,516
Well, that's all right, then.

255
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,556
Age, habits, hobbies, likes, dislikes.

256
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,596
Now, did you say you'd been married before?

257
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,750
That's right. Twice.

258
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,751
Are your wives dead?

259
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,989
That's right.

260
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,798
I see.

261
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,678
The first wife died from eating mushrooms.

262
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,796
Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that.

263
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,472
So was she.

264
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,593
The second wife died from a fractured skull.

265
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,990
A fractured skull? How did that happen?

266
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,593
Wouldn't eat the mushrooms.

267
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,636
Wouldn't eat the mu...

268
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,758
Thank you, Dr Crippen.
Don't call us, we'll call you.

269
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,432
Thank you.

270
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,312
You must be joking!

271
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,396
Oh, good afternoon.
The Wedded Bliss Agency sent me.

272
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,833
Mr Philpot?

273
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,957
That's right. I'm supposed to meet
a Miss Jenny Grubb.

274
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,234
You wouldn't be?

275
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,639
Jenny is my daughter.

276
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,996
Oh, thank goodness...
Er, thank goodness I've come to the right place.

277
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,832
That remains to be seen.

278
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,876
Thank you very much.

279
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,672
Jenny is in here, Mr Philpot, having tea.

280
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,673
- You haven't had it, have you?
- Oh, no. No, this is the first time we've met.

281
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,718
- Tea, Mr Philpot.
- Oh, I'm sorry. No, I haven't.

282
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,316
Good afternoon.

283
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,275
Nice day.

284
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,591
This is Mr Philpot, who wishes to marry Jenny.

285
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,514
I say, steady on. I mean,
give us a chance to get to know each other first.

286
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,352
See how we hit it off, eh?

287
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,273
Mr Philpot, you may as well understand
here and now

288
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,909
that there will be no question of "hitting it off"
before marriage.

289
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,152
No, I just didn't want you to get the wrong idea.
I only went to the agency for a bit of fun.

290
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,949
If it's fun you want,
I fear you've come to the wrong place.

291
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,439
Yes, I can see that.

292
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,075
Well, you may as well meet Jenny
now that you're here.

293
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,037
Oh, thanks. Well, nice to have met you all.

294
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,076
She's here, Mr Philpot.

295
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,676
This is Jenny.

296
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,516
How do you do, Jenny?

297
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,512
No physical contact yet, please.

298
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,239
Jenny, get Mr Philpot some tea.

299
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,555
(Crunch)

300
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,596
Oh, I'm so sorry!

301
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,033
I beg your pardon.

302
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,678
(Squeak)
- Ow!

303
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,314
(Boing)

304
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,676
Thank you.

305
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,918
Well, this is jolly nice.

306
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,798
- Sugar?
- What?

307
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,836
- Sugar?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

308
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,432
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

309
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,476
I beg your pardon. It slipped.

310
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,913
Sorry.

311
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,672
Oh!

312
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,193
- Mr Philpot?
- Yes.

313
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,352
Would you mind resuming your seat
before you wreck the entire house?

314
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,714
Yes, I'm so sorry.

315
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,153
(Saucer smashes)
- Ah!

316
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,278
I seem to have... done one of your saucers in.

317
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,796
No matter. It's only Crown Derby.

318
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,950
- Oh, that's all right, then.
<i>- Jenny.</i>

319
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,270
Please get Mr Philpot some more tea.

320
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,999
You must think I'm awfully clumsy.

321
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,552
Yes, but we will overlook your more obvious
shortcomings and get down to practical matters.

322
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,596
<i>Regarding the period of courtship...</i>

323
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,715
Yes?

324
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,360
You'll be permitted to see Jenny once a week,

325
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,477
in company of myself, of course,
and other members of the family.

326
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,676
You mean, I wouldn't be able to see her alone?

327
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,990
Oh, I don't think that'd be at all wise.

328
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,550
Jenny has led a very sheltered life
and has had little or no experience of men.

329
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,868
Really?

330
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,916
- I have done it.
- I beg your pardon?

331
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,956
- Put it in.
- Oh!

332
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,076
- The sugar.
- Ah!

333
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,879
And what is your financial status, Mr Philpot?

334
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,395
Excuse me. Actually, I have
a private income of about L#3,000 a year.

335
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,674
Is that all?

336
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,193
Well, it's enough.

337
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,475
Not enough to run a big house of this size.

338
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,076
There's myself, you see,
and other members of the family to provide for.

339
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,072
We don't live extravagantly,
but we do like to live well.

340
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,116
Just a minute. Just a minute.

341
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,115
Just supposing I was mug enough to marry her,
do you really think I'd live here? With this lot?

342
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,952
Naturally.

343
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,033
We have always been and we intend to remain
one big, happy family.

344
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,750
Oh, no, I'm afraid it just wouldn't work out.
They'd never fit in with the way I like to live.

345
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,274
All-night parties. Strip poker. Pot-smoking.

346
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,679
No, I'm afraid not.

347
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,751
I'll say goodbye and thank you for the tea.

348
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,676
Bye.

349
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,438
I like him.

350
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,674
Wedded Bliss Agency.
Let us bring a little happiness into your life.

351
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,433
Oh, hello, Mr Philpot. How was the introduction?

352
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,272
<i>(Garbled speech)</i>

353
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,954
Yes, I'm sorry she wasn't quite
what you were looking for.

354
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,635
I can't vet them all personally.
Inever even saw Miss Grubb.

355
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,752
- Her mother did what?
<i>- (Garbled speech)</i>

356
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,308
Well, yes, yes, and I sympathise, Mr Philpot.

357
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,356
Hang on, hang on a minute, will you?

358
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,671
Maybe I can put you onto something
a little more amenable.

359
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,716
Er...

360
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,233
Oh, yes.

361
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,437
We have Miss Adams here.
Now, there's an absolute cracker for you.

362
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,636
Just the job for you - and she can cook, too.

363
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,073
Yes? Right.

364
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,709
The phone number is 663404271, right?

365
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,349
Not at all, Mr Philpot.
We aim to see that all our clients get satisfaction.

366
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,395
<i>(Blows raspberry)</i>

367
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,436
And you.

368
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,758
Esme Crowfoot. You've got to do something
about that, Sidney.

369
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,639
Sophie, darling, I've been thinking.

370
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,709
Well?

371
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,793
About me fixing it up for that young Muffin fellow
to meet Miss Crowfoot. It's all wrong.

372
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,314
I don't like the sound of this. What are you up to?

373
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,231
Nothing. I phoned her up and cancelled it.

374
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,198
And what happens when he goes down
to the bar to meet her at 7:30?

375
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,876
Oh, I'd forgotten about that. That's a nuisance.
I'll have to go down myself and explain.

376
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,953
Oh, that's a good idea. Yes. I'll come, too.

377
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,828
Why not? Oh, wait a minute. You can't.
We've got that Snooper fellow coming at 8:00.

378
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,356
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll go down and explain to Mr Muffet.

379
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,670
You stay here and see Mr Snooper.

380
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,716
Oh, no, that wouldn't be fair, would it?

381
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,268
I got him into this mess,
it's up to me to get him out of it.

382
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,511
I've got a few calls to make on the way.
I'll be seeing you.

383
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,556
When will you be seeing me?

384
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,153
Sidney Bliss!

385
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,154
I'll fix you, Sidney Bliss.

386
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,155
Oh, hello! Of course I remember you, Mrs Bliss.

387
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,596
Yes, we last met at that wedding
when I guarded the presents.

388
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,596
Yes, it was a pity about that.

389
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,830
No, they never did find the bride again.

390
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,070
Such a nice girl, too.

391
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,596
Well, I rang you, Mr Bedsop,
because I want someone followed.

392
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,636
Mr Bliss, actually.

393
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,711
My husband, yes, that's right.

394
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,633
Oh, well, if you'll describe him for me.

395
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,312
Rotten,

396
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,958
cheating,

397
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,995
lying ba...

398
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,311
No! No, Mrs Bliss,
a physical description, if you please.

399
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,960
Yes. Yes.

400
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,397
The general appearance
of an ancient and dissipated walnut.

401
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,711
And what's more, I can tell you
where he'll be at 7:30 this evening.

402
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,109
At the Parkway Hotel Cocktail Bar.

403
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,873
Right. You leave it to me, Mrs Bliss.

404
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,394
Check. Roger, over and out.

405
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,672
No filming tonight, then, Sally?

406
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,196
No, worst luck. I have to meet a photographer
from the publicity agency here.

407
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,713
Some more pin -ups, eh?

408
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,510
That's it. Sally Martin,
unknown star of stage, screen and television,

409
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,513
pictured in her home, with everything about her
but her clothes.

410
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,675
How do you do? Meeting you is
the most exciting moment of my life, straight up.

411
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,551
(Clears throat)

412
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,235
Excuse me... but I'm from the agency.

413
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,833
Oh, yes. Hello.

414
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,229
Hello.

415
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,799
Well?

416
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,394
Muffet. Bertram Muffet.

417
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,278
Oh. How do you do, Mr Muffet?

418
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,316
Fine, thank you.

419
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,635
It's the most exciting moment of my life
meeting you straight up.

420
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,676
Really?

421
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,719
Oh, well, er, it's nice to meet someone
who knows who I am.

422
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,553
They told me at the agency, you see.

423
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,631
Don't go and spoil it.

424
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,631
I wonder if you would do me a pleasure?

425
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,948
What?

426
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,634
Um, the pleasure of having a meal somewhere.

427
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,555
Oh. Well, it's really very sweet of you,
but it's not really necessary, you know.

428
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,119
Isn't it?

429
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,156
No.

430
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,109
Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's go
straight back to my place and get down to it, eh?

431
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,472
Some blokes have all the luck.

432
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,833
Excuse me. Have you had a fellow in here
looking for a woman?

433
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,114
We never get any other kind.

434
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,270
<i>Don't mess about. Small, skinny fellow.</i>

435
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,316
- A bit dopey-looking.
- Bertram Muffet?

436
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,277
- He left with Miss Martin.
- Martin?

437
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,315
Sally Martin.

438
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,998
Oh.

439
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,753
She's taken him back to her place...
to get down to it.

440
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,955
Pardon?

441
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,996
- That's what she said.
- Did she?

442
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,798
And I called him a dope!

443
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,510
Well, this is it.

444
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,194
I share with another girl, but you don't have
to worry. She's working this evening.

445
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,396
Ooh, it's very nice. Very nice, indeed.

446
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,916
- Well, anyway, it's better than Regents Park.
- Regents Park?

447
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,390
Yes. That's where I did it last time.
On the bridge over the canal.

448
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,198
- Really?
<i>- Mm.</i>

449
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,989
It was awful. Freezing cold.
And people kept stopping to watch.

450
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,672
I'm not surprised.

451
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,716
I suppose so.

452
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,756
Still, it's annoying.

453
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,952
Now, that's my bedroom, and
through there's the kitchen and the bathroom.

454
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,792
You'll want to go in there, won't you?

455
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,394
Oh, no, thanks. Not just at the moment.

456
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,517
Please yourself.
Only most blokes seem to want one in the bath.

457
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,068
In the bath? Certainly not.

458
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,391
Oh. Well, I've got this big sponge,
you see, and a loofah.

459
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,391
I'm sure you could do something with that.

460
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,708
No, thank you.

461
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,076
OK. OK. You're doing it.
Now, where would you like to start?

462
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,118
Well, really, I'm quite happy in here.

463
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,909
Fine. Well, you get all ready, then,
and I'll go and get out of these clothes.

464
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,520
No, no, no, don't!
I mean, there's no hurry, is there?

465
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,353
- Well, I haven't got all night.
- Well, I don't want all night.

466
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,395
I mean...

467
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,914
Well, you look absolutely lovely as you are.

468
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,956
In this? You must be joking!

469
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,996
No, really. I like it.

470
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,629
Well, it's very sweet of you to say so,
but let's be sensible about this.

471
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,396
I mean, I'm not crazy about stripping off, believe
me, but it's what people want these days.

472
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,278
So, I say, if they want it, let 'em have it.

473
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,195
- Ooh!
- Oi! What do you think you're doing?

474
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,713
Hey, come back here!

475
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,510
And just what are you playing about at?

476
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,558
Everything's all right, Officer.
There's nothing wrong at all.

477
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,995
- I was looking for a man who I was following.
- Really?

478
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,470
- I think you'd better come with me.
- I don't think you understand.

479
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,675
I was following a man.

480
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,716
<i>He went in the cloakroom, so I followed him.</i>

481
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,677
W-W-W-Wh...

482
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,716
(Cackles)

483
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,914
Ooh! If they get any shorter,
they'll have two more cheeks to powder.

484
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,837
Taxi! Taxi!

485
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,716
Rogerham Mansions.

486
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,473
Watch it!
Don't use language like that to me, mate.

487
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,994
You deaf old twit! Go to that address.

488
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,719
<i>Quick as you can.</i>

489
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,036
Come back, you fool! Here!

490
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,792
Taxi!

491
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,996
Follow that cab.

492
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,798
(Mouths)

493
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,113
OK. I'm ready.

494
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,869
Well, you don't have to look so worried.
I'll take this off as soon as you're ready.

495
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,393
Do you like it? It's Orlon.

496
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,869
It looks more like "all off" to me.

497
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,837
Where do you want me?

498
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,876
Well, I really don't mind.

499
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,916
Well, you say, you're the expert.

500
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,638
How about on the bed?

501
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,994
No.

502
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,559
Well, where, then?

503
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,359
Well, I mean,
couldn't we just sit and talk for a bit?

504
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,273
Sit and talk? What about?

505
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,909
Anything. I mean,
I just didn't expect things to happen so quickly.

506
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,956
Just a minute.

507
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,508
Is this the first time you've ever done this?

508
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,192
Yes.

509
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,670
Oh, no. Don't say they've sent me a learner.

510
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,593
But I know what to do.
I mean, I've read books and things.

511
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,390
Oh, well. I suppose everybody's got to start
sometime, haven't they?

512
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,233
So, let's give it a try, eh?

513
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,355
I only bought this outfit this morning.

514
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,192
I hope it shows enough.

515
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,713
Oh, yes, plenty.

516
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,756
Well, if it doesn't, just yell out.

517
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,070
Now, how about lying on the rug to start with?

518
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,396
Throw me a cushion, can you?

519
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,273
That's it.

520
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,873
How's that?

521
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,678
Wonderful.

522
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,832
Well, come on, then. Where is it?

523
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,911
Where's what?

524
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,911
Your camera.

525
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,479
Oh, but I haven't got one.

526
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,393
What? What's that in your case?

527
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,516
Oh, that's my model aeroplanes.

528
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,079
Your what?

529
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,515
Model aeroplanes.
I thought you'd like to see them.

530
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,353
Why would I want to see
your model aeroplanes?

531
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,070
Well, they told me at the agency that you make
Christmas decorations out of milk bottle tops.

532
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,392
- That's what I make these with.
- Christmas decorations out of milk bottle tops?

533
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,471
Right. I've never done that. It must be fun.

534
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,633
Oh, yes, yes. It's really great fun.
You really must try it.

535
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,156
But just who at the agency
told you all this about me?

536
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,437
The chap who runs it. Mr Bliss. This one.

537
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,353
The Wedded Bliss Agency.

538
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,591
This is to introduce Mr Bertram Muffin.

539
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,194
- Yes, it should be Muffet.
- You're not a photographer?

540
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,589
Oh, dear me, no. I'm an undertaker's assistant.

541
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,636
An undertaker's... Oh!

542
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,188
Oh, look, I'm terribly sorry, Mr Muffin...

543
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,236
- Muffet.
<i>- But there's been a mistake.</i>

544
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,072
I think you've met the wrong person.

545
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,037
- You are Miss Crowfoot, aren't you?
<i>- No.</i>

546
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,396
You see, I was going to meet a man
from the photo agency,

547
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,917
<i>and when you said you were from the agency,</i>
<i>I naturally thought that it was</i> you.

548
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,993
Oh. Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
But when I saw you, I thought...

549
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,390
Oh, what an idiot I've been. Excuse me.

550
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,476
You don't have to go. It wasn't your fault.

551
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,994
- I'm terribly sorry.
<i>- Wait a minute!</i>

552
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,036
(Laughs)

553
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,596
<i>All right?</i>

554
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,349
Well, that's it. Can't go any further.
Not without getting arrested.

555
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,678
You! I said I never wanted to see you again.

556
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,716
Help me! Help me!

557
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,756
What's happened to you? You're all wet.

558
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,308
I'm sorry, I didn't know anybody else
I could turn to.

559
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,392
What have you been doing? Come on inside.

560
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,436
Thank you. Thank you.

561
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,353
You're soaking. What have you been doing?

562
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,433
I couldn't help it. I just couldn't face
going through life any more without you.

563
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,475
What do you mean?

564
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,437
I tried to drown myself.

565
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,192
Where? What in?

566
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,032
The canal.

567
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,475
Canal? What canal?

568
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,632
What does it matter what canal?
They've all got water, haven't they?

569
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,190
Well, that was a silly thing to do.
Those canals are filthy dirty.

570
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,475
Who cares about that
when you're going to drown?

571
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,073
Why didn't you drown?

572
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,390
I forgot I could swim.

573
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,916
Come on. Get those wet things off
before you catch your death.

574
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,232
Fancy! No-one's ever tried to do away
with themselves because of me before.

575
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,632
- I'm flattered.
- You should be. This suit cost me 30 quid.

576
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,395
I didn't really mean it, Sidney, you know,
about not wanting to see you again.

577
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,189
Thank you.
I don't want much, just to worship at your feet.

578
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,793
I've got better bits.

579
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,276
I'll put this by the fire.
Have you wet your trousers?

580
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,316
Eh? Oh!

581
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,995
Oh, yes. Well, I mean,
I went in feet first, didn't I? And my shirt.

582
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,310
Then, we'd better have it off, hadn't we?

583
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,675
You took the thought right out of my mind.

584
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,950
(Doorbell chimes Here Comes The Bride)

585
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,358
- Mr Snooper, is it?
- That is correct.

586
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,479
Oh, do come in. I'm sorry Mr Bliss can't be here.
I'm Mrs Bliss. Do sit down.

587
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,516
- Oh, thank you.
- That's it.

588
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,353
You don't mind discussing your problems
with a woman, I hope?

589
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,477
Oh, no, not at all.
My mother was a woman, you know.

590
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,754
Really?

591
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,197
I hope you don't mind my coming so late, but
I wanted to wait till everyone had gone home,

592
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,633
<i>and the streets were clear.</i>

593
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,349
I wouldn't like to be seen coming here,
you understand?

594
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,718
Oh, you don't have to be embarrassed
coming to a marriage bureau, Mr Snooper.

595
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,157
The mating instinct is in all of us.
Everybody's doing it these days.

596
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,518
I know! I have to spend half my time
listening to <i>how</i> they do it.

597
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,874
I beg your pardon?

598
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,555
I am a marriage guidance counsellor, Mrs Bliss,

599
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,875
and my superior feels it would be advantageous
if I were married.

600
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,916
Oh, I understand.

601
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,872
Though, I must confess, I find it difficult
to believe that anyone as... cultured

602
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,875
and distinguished-looking as yourself
would have any difficulty in finding a wife.

603
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,954
That is very true, of course,
and up till now, I've had no need for one.

604
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,158
Miss Dempsey, my housekeeper,
caters for my every need...

605
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,549
<i>about the house, of course.</i>

606
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,394
Cooking, cleaning and scrubbing.
She does all the scrubbing.

607
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,635
So, what you really want is a wife
who can satisfy your superior.

608
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,757
Good gracious, no! He has his own wife.

609
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,796
Yes, of course.

610
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,111
Well, I'm quite sure that
we'll find someone suitable for you.

611
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,389
A woman with charm and intelligence who can
grace your table and run your house efficiently.

612
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,519
- Yes. And bring me a cup of tea in bed.
- Oh, of course.

613
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,830
I always fancy it in the mornings, you know.

614
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,558
Really?

615
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,270
Oh, yes. Gets the system going.
I am a man of regular habits.

616
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,874
Once a week, I dine at my club.

617
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,916
Once a week, I play squash.

618
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,993
Once a week, bridge, and so on.
Everything in moderation.

619
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,790
Yes, of course. Well, I think
once a week is enough for anything, don't you?

620
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,518
Precisely.

621
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,639
Well, I'm sure that
we'll be able to find someone suitable.

622
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,679
And being a virile man,
of course you would like to have a child.

623
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,435
Oh, no! A fully-grown woman, I think.

624
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,799
Excuse me, I'd like to use the phone, if I may.

625
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,031
I'm awfully sorry to disturb you,
but this is important.

626
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,032
Oh. Oh, I'm awfully sorry to trouble you,

627
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,556
but would you have a sixpence
for two threepenny bits, please?

628
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,396
By any chance?

629
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,076
Oh. Oh, thank you very much.

630
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,269
Thank you.

631
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,670
Well, here's your receipt, Mr Snooper,

632
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,196
and we'll be getting in touch with you very soon
regarding an introduction.

633
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,398
Thank you very much. And I must let you
get home now. You're looking rather tired.

634
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,517
Well, it is a long day
and Mr Bliss and I are always at it.

635
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,955
Well, as long as it's not through overwork.

636
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,276
(Phone rings)

637
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,075
Wedded Bliss Agency. Mrs Bliss.

638
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,151
Ah, Mr Muffet.

639
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,471
Oh, hello. Mrs Bliss,
I'm afraid there's been a bit of a mix-up.

640
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,994
I seem to have met the wrong girl. Yes.

641
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,994
Um, no, I got the right place and time,

642
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,358
but there was this girl who thought
I was someone else and I thought it was her.

643
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,389
And we didn't find out her mistake... I mean,
my mistake, until she got most of her clothes off.

644
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,233
But I don't understand this, Mr Muffet.

645
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,709
Didn't Mr Bliss meet you at the bar?

646
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,360
No? Are you sure?

647
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,276
I see.

648
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,751
Oh, yes, I think I know what he's doing,
Mr Muffet.

649
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,798
Look, you still want to meet Miss Crowfoot,
I take it?

650
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,836
Good.

651
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,876
Why don't you go to her flat?

652
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,195
Yes. I'll give you the address.

653
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,592
Um, Rogerham Mansions, yes. Dunham Road.

654
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,992
Right. Yes, and thank you.
Yes, thank you, Mrs Bliss. Goodbye.

655
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,795
<i>Esme! Esme!</i>

656
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,476
- Are you feeling better now?
- No.

657
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,120
But I might if I didn't have to
keep looking at that thing.

658
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,031
Oh, don't you think he's rather gorgeous?

659
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,190
<i>- Gorgeous?!</i>
- That's Gripper.

660
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,111
Griper would be more like it.

661
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,270
Gripper Burke. He's a wrestler.

662
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,396
Get away! I thought it was a ballet dancer.

663
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,038
Well, he and I had quite a thing once.

664
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,554
I don't know what it was,
but he had quite a hold on me.

665
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,232
Probably the Indian death lock.

666
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,118
Then he had to go to America
and I haven't heard from him since.

667
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,839
Obviously the same as me,
all-out for a submission.

668
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,480
Now, don't start that nonsense all over again.

669
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,552
Nonsense? Haven't you heard?
That's what makes the world go round.

670
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,633
I've done my share of keeping it going
in the past, now I'll let someone else have a go.

671
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,029
- Me, for instance. Come here!
- No, Sidney, don't!

672
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,871
Sidney, you mustn't! Not in your condition.

673
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,633
- Right now I couldn't be in a better condition.
- No, Sidney.

674
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,349
Oh, come on, darling.
I'm not just on the make - I really fancy you.

675
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,996
No!

676
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,230
Oh, blimey, why not?

677
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,312
Because I am keeping myself.

678
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,949
- That's all right. I don't want to keep you.
- I mean, for the man I marry.

679
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,235
- You're making a big mistake.
- Why?

680
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,232
- It's like a car, isn't it?
- What is?

681
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,676
You lay it up for a few years,
suddenly you want to use it and it's rusted up.

682
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,239
<i>True.</i>

683
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,390
But if it has a regular service... no trouble.

684
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,074
- Look, it's not that I don't want to, Sid, but...
- Yes?

685
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,718
(Doorbell rings)

686
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,950
- Who can that be?
- Never mind. Don't answer it.

687
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,679
- I have to. It might be business.
- What do you think this is?

688
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,716
I'll get rid of them as quick as I can.

689
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,956
(Doorbell rings)

690
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,878
Pussycat!

691
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,916
Gripper! Oh!

692
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,559
Oh! W-W-When did you get back?

693
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,234
Just now. I had enough of it over there.

694
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,959
Besides, I missed you too much.

695
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,157
I'm sure you did, Gripper.
Oh, put me down, please, you're hurting me.

696
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,754
- Eh?
- You're... Oh! Oh!

697
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,473
Oh... There.

698
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,120
Nobody can say Gripper Burke don't fight fair.

699
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,758
No, no, no!

700
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,877
Oh, Esme, darling,
I can't wait to get started with you again.

701
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,916
I'm sure you can't, but not tonight, please.

702
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,436
What? You haven't found somebody else,
have you? Because you promised.

703
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,557
- Oh, no, of course not, no.
- Oh, well, that's all right, then.

704
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,189
- Seconds out. Second round. Doing!
- No, Gripper, please, no!

705
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,236
<i>Hey!</i>

706
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,276
<i>No, Gripper. No, Gripper, please!</i>

707
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,476
<i>No, no, Gripper!</i>

708
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,516
No! No!

709
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,158
Gotcha!

710
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,710
My favourite hold, remember?
It used to make you turn to jelly.

711
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,872
Yes, but I don't really feel like
turning to jelly tonight, Gripper.

712
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,509
- That's all right. We've got all night.
- No, dear. I really am awfully tired.

713
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,033
<i>Oh, all right, then.</i>

714
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,076
There. That's better.

715
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,709
'Ere, let me tell you about my last fight
in the States.

716
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,678
Man Mountain Dawson they call him.

717
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:16,437
Man Mountain?! More like Ant Heap, he was!

718
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,796
He couldn't have wrestled with
his bloomin' conscience!

719
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,749
Anyway, in the first round, he comes out
roaring and bellowing like some animal...

720
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,555
- It sounds fascinating, Gripper, go on.
- 'Ere, those are men's clothes.

721
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,712
- You've got a bloke here!
- No, of course not, Gripper.

722
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,713
Where is he? I'll kill him! I'll tear him apart!

723
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,156
See? I told you there was no-one here.

724
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,076
- Do you think I'm daft or something?
- Yes.

725
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,912
- Eh?
- No, no, no. I mean, no.

726
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,434
Tell me, then.
What were those clothes doing here?

727
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,590
I was just drying them off for someone.

728
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,674
Yeah? Well, he'd better not come back
while I'm here, or he'll find me waiting for him.

729
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,716
(Thunderclap)

730
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,356
Oh, no!

731
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,669
Honest, Gripper, I haven't seen any other men
since you went away.

732
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,716
- Honest?
- Yes, really.

733
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,836
(Doorbell rings)

734
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,157
Good evening.
This is Miss Crowfoot's flat, isn't it?

735
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,800
Yeah. What about it?

736
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,952
Well, they said if I was to come here,
it would be all right.

737
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,713
Oh, they did, did they?

738
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,598
Yes, Mr Bliss said that
she'd be just what I was looking for.

739
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,238
<i>Oh.</i>

740
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,278
- Well, you'd better come in, hadn't you?
- Thank you.

741
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,316
Hello. I'm from the agency.

742
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

743
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,159
You're from the agency, did you say?

744
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,312
Yes, that's right. Muffet's the name.
Bertram Muffet.

745
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,189
- Gripper! What are you doing?
- I'll kill him!

746
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,637
Aaaah!

747
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,236
Good night, Esme.

748
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,230
Hello, is that the Wedded Bliss Agency?

749
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:35,077
Good. I was trying to trace a Mr Bertram Muffet.
A client of yours, I believe.

750
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,116
Yes.

751
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,156
What?

752
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,196
What's he doing in a hospital?

753
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,633
What?

754
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,269
Look, darling, I love you, I adore you
and you're my very favourite model,

755
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,316
- but not for this particular job.
- Why not?

756
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,675
No bristols. You're flat-chested.

757
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,193
Adrian, please!

758
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,635
- What do you mean, flat-chested?
- Well...

759
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,235
Sally, did you hear him? Am I flat-chested?
Am I, now?

760
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,550
I don't know. Turn around and let's have a look.

761
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,198
Oh, ha-ha!

762
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,952
You've never worried about it before.

763
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,191
Look, I have told you, for this particular job,
they want watermelons.

764
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,714
All right. Go and find someone else. I don't care.

765
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,519
I wish I could.
That's why I asked you if you knew somebody.

766
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,592
You think I'd tell you?
Find your own watermelons!

767
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,559
Look, darling, I love you, but if I can't find
any watermelons, I'm out of business.

768
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,596
Hello. Are you still there?

769
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,636
I'm sorry. I was interrupted.

770
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,950
Could you tell me which hospital he's in?

771
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,792
Oh, thanks.

772
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,836
Thanks a lot.

773
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,276
(Doorbell rings)

774
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,518
Oh, excuse me, but I saw an advert
for someone to share a flat.

775
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,556
Oh, yes. Come in.

776
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,596
Thank you.

777
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,676
There's two of us here at the moment,
but we could use a third.

778
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,150
It'll be about L#5 a week each. All right?

779
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,073
Oh, yes. At least it will be
as soon as I can get another job.

780
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,479
Oh, what do you do, then?

781
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,913
Well, I was a stuffer.

782
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,877
I beg your pardon?

783
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,678
Oh. For sausage meat.

784
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,068
In a sausage factory.

785
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,957
Oh, yes.

786
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,519
You know, putting it in.

787
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,352
Why did you give it up?

788
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,069
Well, it wasn't a very interesting job.
Besides, I wanted to get away from home.

789
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,436
I'm sure you'll find something else.
Would you like to see round the flat?

790
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,273
I've got to go.
If I don't find a girl, I'll lose this job.

791
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,316
I wish I were dead.

792
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,190
- Er, this is Adrian.
- Oh, how do you do?

793
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,794
Darling girl, where did you come from? Heaven?

794
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,552
No. Fulham.

795
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,595
Hm?

796
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,150
Fulham. Wonderful, beautiful Fulham.

797
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,468
What does he mean?

798
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:46,271
Oh, darling, let me rest my mince pies.
Phwoar, they are... great!

799
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,430
- Knockout.
- What?

800
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,873
They are all yours, I take it?

801
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,518
Oh, don't be a fool, Adrian.

802
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,149
Oh, yeah, of course. They must be.
All right, darling. Get your gear off.

803
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,389
What?

804
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,630
Your clothes. I want to have a butcher's at you.

805
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,439
Who do you think I am?

806
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,876
Adrian, for heaven's sake, stop!
She isn't a model, you know.

807
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,394
Really? Well, what do you do, then, darling?

808
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,755
I shouldn't tell him that if I was you.

809
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,310
As a matter of fact,
she's not working at anything at the moment.

810
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,958
Oh?

811
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,828
Well, you are now, my darling. Phwoar!

812
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,712
'Ere, I never quite gathered, mate,
but what's supposed to be wrong with you?

813
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,392
Me?

814
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,153
Oh, nothing at all. Why?

815
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,593
There must be something wrong.

816
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,035
No, I'm fine.

817
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,116
He's over there.

818
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,839
Oh, thanks. I promise I'll only be a few minutes.

819
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,115
Oh!

820
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,792
Oh, I say, I'm awfully sorry. I didn't see you...

821
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,194
Gosh! You!

822
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,554
Yes.

823
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,076
Well, nobody can accuse us
of having dull meetings, can they?

824
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,593
But how did you get here?

825
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,752
Well, you left your card that night
and they told me where you were.

826
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,796
Oh, I see.

827
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,476
Oh. Excuse me.

828
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,790
I came because I wanted to apologise
for what happened in the flat that night.

829
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,793
You? But I'm the one who should apologise.
I behaved like an absolute clot.

830
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,759
No, it was really all my fault.
If I'd known who you were...

831
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,796
Oh, nonsense.

832
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,598
Anyway, nothing did happen, did it?

833
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,798
No. But what must you have thought of me,
taking all my clothes off like that!

834
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,394
Well, I can tell you now, I did feel a bit shaky.

835
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,358
Especially when you asked me
where I wanted you.

836
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,275
<i>And you should have seen your face when I laid</i>
<i>down on the rug and told you to get on with it!</i>

837
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,316
<i>And I turned and bolted!</i>

838
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,118
<i>Well, er...</i>

839
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,156
I just wanted to say sorry.

840
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,595
I'll have to go now.

841
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,468
Oh, no, look, wait. Look, I get out of here
tomorrow. Could I see you again?

842
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,312
Well, if you really want to.

843
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:31,154
Oh, rather! I'd like to see a lot more of you.

844
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,708
Oh, well, there isn't much
you haven't already seen.

845
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,472
No, I don't mean that.

846
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,118
No, I know.

847
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,555
Well, if you'd like to give me a call sometime...

848
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,596
- Yes, soon as I get out.
- Fine.

849
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,636
Bye for now, then.

850
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,039
- Oh.
- Yes?

851
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,035
Um, don't think I'm being nosy,
but there is one thing I just have to know.

852
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,838
I haven't got a girl, if that's it.

853
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,835
No, but do you really make model aeroplanes
out of milk bottle tops?

854
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,592
<i>Yes.</i>

855
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,639
Oh. Good.
Well, I'll start saving mine for you, then.

856
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,676
Bye.

857
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,236
Aeroplanes out of milk bottle tops?

858
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,359
Look, mate, I couldn't help hearing,
but is it really right, all that stuff?

859
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,873
What?

860
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,838
Well, you know, her stripping off
and laying on the rug and that?

861
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,478
Oh, yes.

862
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,438
- And you turned and ran?
- Yes.

863
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,318
Blimey! And you say
there's nothing wrong with you!

864
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,196
<i>And the next, please.</i>

865
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,113
Why, Mrs Bliss! What a pleasant surprise.
Do come in. Sit down.

866
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,155
Thank you.

867
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,913
Well, what brings you here
and what can I do for you?

868
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,560
Not a marital problem, I trust? (Laughs)

869
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,990
Well, hardly, Mr Snooper.
You see, I'm not married.

870
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,150
Yes, well, of course, that would be...

871
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,358
What?
You mean, you and Mr Bliss are living in sin?

872
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,396
Well, not that either, unfortunately.

873
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,198
I don't understand.

874
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,478
For business reasons, he thought it would be
better if we appeared to be husband and wife.

875
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,439
Of course, we always had an understanding
that one day we <i>would</i> marry.

876
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,080
At least, I had an understanding.

877
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,116
How long has this been going on?

878
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,953
- Ten years.
- Oh, how terrible!

879
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,395
Oh, my dear Mrs Bliss.

880
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,038
Miss Plummet, actually.

881
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,076
Miss Plummet, oh.

882
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,912
How nice.

883
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,833
And you would like me to talk to Mr Bliss?

884
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,593
Oh, no. I'd never marry him now.

885
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,719
No, really, I came to talk about us...

886
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,358
About us?

887
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,150
Yes, you see, I've been studying your case
very carefully, Mr Snooper.

888
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,470
And frankly, I feel that I am the only one

889
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,554
who comes anywhere near
satisfying your requirements for a wife.

890
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,076
Oh, well, I don't know about that. I'd have to...

891
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,390
Oh, please, listen to me, Mr Snooper.

892
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,836
I'm sure you'll agree that
I'm not one of your flighty young women.

893
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,309
Oh, no. No, not at all.

894
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,712
So, as far as sex is concerned,
I'd like to make my position quite clear.

895
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,555
- Yes, well, the position is half the battle, isn't it?
- Yes.

896
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:20,193
As your wife, I would run your home efficiently,
I would preside over your table gracefully,

897
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,193
and await any further demands... hopefully.

898
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,279
Well, that is a most generous offer,
Miss Plummet.

899
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,718
I promise you, Mr Snooper,
you'll find me generous in all things.

900
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,555
Yes, well, I'd like a little time to think about it,
of course, you understand.

901
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,868
Of course.

902
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,518
I've been a bachelor for so long,

903
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,434
I can't help wondering
whether I'd be very satisfying as a husband.

904
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,273
- You know...
- I know.

905
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,353
On the other hand, with you, I can't help
feeling there's a chance it might work.

906
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,194
Well, don't worry.
If it didn't, we could always adopt a child.

907
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,353
What do you mean,
you're not coming into the office any more?

908
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,396
But, Sophie, I need you here.

909
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,631
What? Oh, that's nice, after all I've done for you.

910
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,676
Now, listen. So...

911
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,115
Sophie.

912
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,634
What's the matter with her? What have I done?

913
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,672
Mr Philpot, what can I do for you?

914
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,433
You can give me my money back.
Every ruddy penny.

915
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,078
- Why? What's up?
- What's up?!

916
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,073
First of all, you sent me to see a girl
called Jenny Grubb. How about that?

917
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,878
Yeah, how about that? I never tried it.

918
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,111
A mouse. I've got more sex in my little finger.

919
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,078
If that weren't bad enough,
you put me onto that Miss Adams.

920
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,832
"An absolute cracker," you said.

921
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,797
That's true. I vetted her personally.

922
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,030
- "A good cook," you said.
- Yes, that's right.

923
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,270
She had something cooking... in the oven.

924
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,429
In the oven?

925
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,830
Yeah, by my reckoning, for about five months -
at regulo ten.

926
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,876
Oh, my gawd!

927
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,076
It's all right. I'm in the clear.

928
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,630
- You won't be if I don't get my money back.
- Wait a minute. Mistakes can happen.

929
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,599
I'll tell you what, I've got another one
here for you. Her name's Esme Crowfoot...

930
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,989
No. You know what you can do with
Esme Crowfoot.

931
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,355
I don't, but if you'd care to find out...

932
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,635
Give me back my money,
or I'm going to the police.

933
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,711
They'll never find you anything any good.

934
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,872
Fraud! That's what it is.
Obtaining money under false pretences.

935
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,236
Steady on. Why don't you just
come and sit down...

936
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,118
(Doorbell chimes Here Comes The Bride)
- Excuse me. Come in!

937
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,633
Just give me my money back...

938
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,596
Oh! Excuse me.

939
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,318
Am I interrupting?

940
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,036
Not at all, miss. Can I help you?

941
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,918
I just popped in to say that
you could take my name off your list.

942
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,036
You? You're on our books?

943
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,269
Don't you remember me?

944
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,112
- No.
<i>- Jenny.</i>

945
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,431
- Jenny Grubb.
- 'Ere, Jenny Grubb?

946
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,670
I came round to your place for tea
the other week.

947
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,320
Yes, and you weren't very impressed, were you?

948
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,356
No... Yes, yes!

949
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,671
It's just that you were dressed
rather differently then.

950
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,796
My parents believe in covering me up.

951
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,192
- They're an old-fashioned pair, you know.
- Nonsense. They're a beautifully-fashioned pair.

952
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,759
Just hang on a minute,

953
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,831
Mr Philpot, it's my client, if you don't mind.

954
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,196
You want to come off our list.
Does that mean you're fixed up with someone?

955
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,748
Well, no, no-one special.
It's just that I've got a job.

956
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,957
I'm a model. And a new flat to live in,
so I thought I'd have a bit of fun.

957
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,476
You couldn't have come at a better time.
Let's go in the other office and talk.

958
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,836
Oh, no, I can't do that.
I've got a modelling job in half an hour.

959
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,992
It's for a new kind of body stocking
and I can't get out of it.

960
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,311
- Come in here, I'll get you out of it.
- No, I must go.

961
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,073
Here, I've got the old jam jar outside.
Let me give you a lift.

962
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,230
Oh, that's very kind of you. Thank you.

963
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,355
Come on, then.

964
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,034
You've forgotten something.
You wanted your money back.

965
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,795
Me? What would I want my money back for?
You've done a splendid job here.

966
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,074
Have I?

967
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,116
Splendid.

968
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,158
Grubb. Jenny Grubb.

969
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,156
Let's have a look at this.

970
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:01,156
Miss Jenny Grubb. Age: 24 years.
Hair: brownish. Eyes: didn't notice.

971
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,038
Height: 5' 6". Never had any.

972
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,636
Eh? Oh, hobbies.
Yeah, well, that'll soon be changed.

973
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,156
Well, this is it.

974
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,196
- All right?
- Mm. Sexy.

975
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,157
Ooh, you! You'd say a lumber room was sexy.

976
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,073
Only if I was rummaging through
your odds and ends.

977
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,116
Have you got in here again?

978
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,599
(Jenny claps her hands)

979
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,636
- Come on out.
(Meows)

980
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,314
Oh, it's the porter's, darned thing.

981
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,356
It's always sneaking in here.

982
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,032
Shoo, Cooking Fat, shoo!

983
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,473
(Jenny claps)

984
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,830
- Cooking Fat?
- Yes.

985
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,399
They can't call it that, surely?

986
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,993
Well, that's what it sounds like.

987
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,156
Come and get comfy.

988
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,879
Here, are you sure
your flatmates won't be back?

989
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,916
No, not until after 11.

990
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,118
- God, I really fancy you, Jenny.
- And I liked you the first time I met you.

991
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,156
Oh, let me get at you.

992
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,708
(Crunch)
- Oh, what the hell am I sitting on?

993
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,756
Urgh!

994
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,400
They're not yours, surely?

995
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,472
No, they're Gaye's. She really is a <i>flat</i> mate.

996
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,516
Come here, you little raver.

997
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,670
Oh, steady on. There's plenty of time.

998
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,671
And plenty of inclination.

999
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,716
Mm.

1000
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,156
- Oh, Terry, stop it.
- Hm?

1001
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,800
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking for the zip.

1002
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,190
- You've got a sauce.
- Well, where is the darned thing?

1003
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,236
As if I'd tell you, anyway!

1004
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,276
- It's on the other side.
- Ah.

1005
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,276
- That's better.
- Ooh!

1006
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,828
- What's the matter?
- You've got cold hands.

1007
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,718
- Oh, Jenny...
- Oh, Terry...

1008
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,191
(Zipper)

1009
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,068
Oh, sorry, Jenny, I didn't know you were here.

1010
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,116
I didn't know <i>you</i> were here.

1011
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,555
Sally, this is my night. Wednesday.

1012
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,871
I know. It's all right. I'm going out.

1013
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,110
As soon as I find my blue sweater, anyway.

1014
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,070
Have you had it?

1015
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,195
Not yet.

1016
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,316
No, I have not had your blue sweater,

1017
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,472
and if you must go on looking for it in here,
will you put something on?

1018
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,516
Oh, sorry.

1019
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,113
But I've got to find it.

1020
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,156
Oh, I know. I bet Gaye's had it again.

1021
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,876
Do you want me to close the door?

1022
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,154
Yes, please.

1023
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,836
Oh, Terry, I'm so sorry.

1024
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,277
Not at all. It's a good job
she wasn't looking for her pants... or was it?

1025
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,834
- Oh, Terry...
- Oh, Jenny...

1026
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,956
(Zipper)

1027
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,359
I found it.

1028
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,749
(Zipper)
- Hooray!

1029
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,037
Ooh, sorry. I won't bother you any more.

1030
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,676
Do you want me to close the door?

1031
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,909
BOTH: Yes!

1032
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,916
Oh, Terry, I'm so sorry.

1033
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,956
Don't mention it. Don't mention it.

1034
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,956
You are sweet.

1035
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,918
- Oh, Jenny...
- Oh, Terry...

1036
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,955
(Zipper)

1037
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,716
- Oh, blimey!
(Zipper)

1038
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,552
Men! I've had them up to here.

1039
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,959
Oh, no.

1040
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,712
Gaye, what are you doing here?

1041
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,233
It is my flat, isn't it?

1042
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,436
Yes, but it's Wednesday. My night.

1043
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,469
Oh, I'm sorry, but I've had another flaming row
with Adrian and I couldn't stand him any longer.

1044
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,676
Gaye, I've got a friend here.

1045
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,593
Oh, well, you don't have to worry.
I'm going to bed.

1046
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,596
I'm glad this is your night.
I'd hate to be here when it wasn't.

1047
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,513
- Oh, Terry...
- Oh, Jenny...

1048
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,636
Give me a number between one and ten.

1049
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,073
Seven.

1050
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,832
You lose. Get your clothes off.

1051
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,558
(Zipper)

1052
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,312
(Doorbell rings)

1053
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,719
(Zipper)

1054
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,360
If that's Bertie,
tell him I won't be a minute, will you?

1055
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,398
- Do it yourself, I'm busy.
(Zipper)

1056
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,708
(Doorbell rings)

1057
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,958
If that's Adrian, tell him to go to hell!

1058
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,796
(Doorbell rings)

1059
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,637
- Oh, I could scream!
(Zipper)

1060
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,113
Ow!

1061
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,116
(Persistent doorbell)

1062
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,515
All right. Where is she? Where is that cow?

1063
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,195
Gaye's in her room
and she doesn't want to see you.

1064
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,555
- Well, I want to see her.
- I'm trying to entertain!

1065
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,834
Oh. How do you do?

1066
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,399
Hello.

1067
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,029
- Open up, there! I want to talk to you!
- Adrian!

1068
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,314
<i>I'll break the door down!</i>

1069
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,355
- Adrian!
- What?

1070
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,793
That is a cupboard!

1071
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,359
<i>Oh.</i>

1072
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,396
Sorry.

1073
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,796
Open up. I want to talk to you.

1074
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,438
<i>Well, I don't want to talk to you.</i>

1075
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,672
- I'll stay here all night if I have to.
- I had a nasty feeling he was going to say that.

1076
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,716
Well? What have you got to say?

1077
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,756
Darling, you know I can't exist without you.

1078
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,549
You seem to be able to exist with all those
other models you keep messing about with.

1079
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,677
Oh, they mean nothing to me! You know that.

1080
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,309
Oh, Terry!

1081
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,116
(Doorbell rings)

1082
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,872
Oh, good. Company.

1083
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,555
Oh, I'm fed up with this!
I might as well be back home.

1084
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,277
- Yes?
- Oh, hello, Jenny. Is Sally ready?

1085
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,316
No. But do come in.

1086
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,356
Oh, thank you.

1087
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,716
Oh, hello.

1088
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,349
Oh, I'm sorry if I'm barging in.
Do go on with what you were doing.

1089
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,396
Chance'd be a fine thing!

1090
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,116
Quite a nice evening.

1091
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,792
Charming.

1092
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,711
I thought it would rain earlier.

1093
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,075
- Really?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1094
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,515
Anyway, we'll probably get it tonight.

1095
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,670
We'll be bloody lucky if we do, mate.

1096
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,159
(Door opens)

1097
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,320
Hello, Bertie. Sorry to have kept you waiting.

1098
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,356
Oh, that's all right.

1099
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,396
Well? What are we going to do, then?

1100
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,712
Well, if you'd like to stop in and make
some aeroplanes, I've brought some tops.

1101
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,918
Er, no, I don't think that would
be a very good idea. Not tonight, Bertie.

1102
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,675
All right. If that's the way it's to be,
I shall kill myself!

1103
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,030
- I will. I mean it.
- Oh, no. No, Adrian, don't! Don't!

1104
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,475
- Not in here.
- I shall shoot myself.

1105
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,028
Go on. Shoot the lot,
then maybe we'll get some peace.

1106
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,317
- Goodbye.
- Oh, stop him, somebody!

1107
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,836
Oh, take cover!

1108
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,116
Boo!

1109
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,839
Aren't you getting tired of following me about?

1110
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,595
Excuse, gentle sir.
Me no spoking very good the English.

1111
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,636
Oh, gawd! A Bombay Bond!

1112
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,676
Ha-ha! Fooled him that time.

1113
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,478
15:02.

1114
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:38,272
Suspect left Cock Inn,
Saloon Bar, and proceeded back to office.

1115
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,629
- Sophie, you're back!
- Only to clear my desk.

1116
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,951
Come on. Surely you're not still suspicious
of Esme Crowfoot and me?

1117
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,873
Ino longer care where you go,
or what you do, or to whom.

1118
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,191
Oh, don't be like that. How about dinner tonight?
Just like old times?

1119
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,396
You mean, like old <i>time?</i> And I paid the bill.

1120
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,072
All right. So it's my turn tonight.

1121
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,436
No, thank you. Anyway,
I'm having dinner with Mr Snooper at his home.

1122
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,839
- Alone?
- Certainly.

1123
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,558
I hope you've got your tin drawers on.

1124
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,518
- (Laughs)
- Mr Snooper and I are to be married.

1125
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,797
Have you gone raving mad?
You don't know anything about the bloke.

1126
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,838
- He's a gentleman.
- I knew there was something wrong with him.

1127
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,957
Well, have you any alternative suggestions
as to my future?

1128
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,439
- Yes, of course I have.
- Well?

1129
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,034
Stay here with me.
It's been all right the last ten years.

1130
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,829
- Goodbye, Sidney.
- Wait a minute, Sophie. Don't leave me like that.

1131
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,150
<i>I'll be lost without you. So will the business.</i>

1132
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,468
Ineed a woman. You know that.

1133
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:38,669
Then I suggest you put the details on the
appropriate card, and stick it in your computer!

1134
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,716
All right, go, then!

1135
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,472
See if I care.

1136
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,155
Marvellous. Give a woman the best years
of your life and look what happens.

1137
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,835
Mr bleedin' Snooper...
Snooper. What's he got, anyway?

1138
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,989
Snooper, Percival.
Percival! Cor blimey, there's a good start!

1139
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,993
Age 43, handsome,
well-mannered, sexually backward.

1140
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,072
That's him all right.
He doesn't know whether he's coming or going.

1141
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,118
Hobbies: reading, walking, playing bridge,
and poking...

1142
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,758
around antique shops.

1143
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,515
45 Bolstrode Avenue.
Occupation: marriage guidance counsellor.

1144
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,309
Fancy! Well, I think it's time
I did a bit of marriage guiding myself.

1145
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,396
Hello, Esme.

1146
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:29,278
Sidney? You've got a nerve ringing me.

1147
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,954
I was wondering if you could
do me a small favour, darling?

1148
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,792
No, not that. Could you meet me tonight?

1149
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,919
I can't. You know how jealous Gripper gets.
Even more so now we're engaged.

1150
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,752
Engaged? Congratulations.

1151
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,355
You know I wouldn't bother you
unless it was desperate. Go on, please.

1152
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,238
Well, all right,
but as long as you promise to behave.

1153
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,790
That's a good girl. Meet me outside
the Parkway Hotel, eight o'clock. Right?

1154
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,472
And wear your sexiest see-through.

1155
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,879
Whatever for?

1156
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,669
Well, just because I can't touch,
doesn't mean I can't look, does it? Eh?

1157
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,716
All right. See you then. Ta-ta.

1158
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,996
(Blows raspberry)

1159
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,753
(Doorbell rings)

1160
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,196
It's all right, Miss Dempsey. I'll go.
This is the lady I was expecting.

1161
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,236
Very good, sir.

1162
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,434
Ah, Miss Plummet!
How nice to see you. Do come in.

1163
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,676
This is Miss Dempsey,
my faithful, old housekeeper.

1164
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:45,320
Oh, I'm so pleased to meet you, Miss Dempsey.

1165
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,039
Mr Snooper has told me
how well you look after him.

1166
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,076
I've always done my best, I'm sure.

1167
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,390
Oh, a treasure. I'd be lost without her.

1168
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,439
Oh, well, I hope you'll stay on
after Percival and I are married,

1169
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,078
<i>Miss Dempsey.</i>

1170
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,072
Married? Oh!

1171
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,116
What on earth's the matter with her?

1172
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,079
- Oh, surely you know? She's in love with you.
- In love, with me?

1173
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:10,709
Of course. You must have felt it on occasions?

1174
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,793
Certainly not. No. I've never laid a finger on her.

1175
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,836
Would you care for a glass of sherry?

1176
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:25,313
Throw me aside like an old, worn -out slipper,
after all the years I've slaved for him.

1177
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:29,154
If I can't have him, nobody else is,
if I can prevent it.

1178
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,153
Ah! Ah, I always knew
it would come in useful one day.

1179
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,673
Ha-ha!

1180
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,753
It's a delightful house, Percival.

1181
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,796
I shall be very happy here.

1182
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,509
Good. I think you'll like
the first-floor front as your bedroom.

1183
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,233
You mean, we won't be sleeping together, then?

1184
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:55,440
Oh, good gracious, no, my dear. Why on earth
should we with a house as large as this?

1185
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,433
Yes, but I think it's a wife's duty
to be close to her husband

1186
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,273
for the warmth and comfort it brings.

1187
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,273
Oh, you don't want to worry about that.
I've got the electric blanket.

1188
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,078
Oh. How nice.

1189
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:13,473
Besides, sharing a bed together, we might be
tempted to indulge in carnal pursuits.

1190
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,676
Oh, rather. Yes.

1191
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,718
And we don't want any of that nonsense, do we?

1192
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,190
Well, you're very strong-willed, obviously,

1193
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,034
but it's a temptation
I would find very hard to avoid.

1194
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,714
Nonsense, my dear! Do as I do.

1195
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,032
Plenty of exercise, cold baths every morning
and a good dose of salts at night.

1196
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,553
Cheers!

1197
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,835
Cheers.

1198
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:50,630
Hang on a minute,
I've just got to make a quick call. Pay the cab.

1199
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,148
(Phone rings)

1200
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,310
Hello. Basher Street Gym here.

1201
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,396
Ah!

1202
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,391
Hold on. Gripper!

1203
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,233
<i>- It's for you.</i>
- Oh. Excuse me.

1204
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,992
Pleasure.

1205
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,596
Hello. Gripper Burke here.

1206
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,432
This is a friend.

1207
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,272
I just thought you ought to know,

1208
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:31,912
an oversexed nut by the name of Snooper
has just lured your fiancee into his house.

1209
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,319
What?! Where?

1210
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,039
Bolstrode Avenue, 45.

1211
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,509
And if I was you, I'd get my skates on quick.

1212
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,475
I think you'll find this wine amusing.

1213
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,393
(Knock on door)
- That'll be Miss Dempsey with the main course.

1214
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,550
She always does something special. Come in!

1215
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,431
Miss Dempsey!

1216
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,998
Miss Dempsey!

1217
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,992
Yes, what is it, love? I mean, sir.

1218
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,837
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1219
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,789
I'll have mine in the kitchen,
so you two can be alone. It's only fair.

1220
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,996
What do you mean?
You always eat in the kitchen.

1221
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,833
Oh, yes, that's right. I always eat in the kitchen.

1222
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,070
Sorry, love.

1223
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:30,674
<i>Well, I'll be leaving you now, then.</i>

1224
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:35,231
Oh, um, will you want your electric blanket
switched on tonight?

1225
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,912
Of course I will. Why shouldn't I?

1226
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,956
Well, we don't always like it, do we?

1227
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,838
I mean, do you! What have I said?

1228
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,990
<i>Miss Dempsey, what are you talking about?</i>

1229
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,039
I'm sorry, I wouldn't like you to get any ideas
about me and Percy.

1230
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,633
<i>I mean, Mr Snooper.</i>

1231
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:54,589
He's always behaved like the perfect gent
with me, except when we, er...

1232
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,796
Well, you know.

1233
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,110
I'm sure he has.

1234
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,112
What are you saying?
I've always been good to you, haven't I?

1235
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,668
Oh, you have, love. I mean, sir.

1236
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,834
He has, too. More than good.
Always gives me a little present afterwards.

1237
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,593
After I've done something
especially nice for him.

1238
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,193
<i>Miss Dempsey!</i>

1239
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,636
- Please!
- I'd better go, before I say something I shouldn't.

1240
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,196
The woman's demented.

1241
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,353
Sophia, surely you can't believe
there's anything in what she said.

1242
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,513
Well, I realise Miss Dempsey may be upset
by the announcement of our marriage.

1243
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,831
On the other hand, there's no smoke without fire.

1244
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,514
And you can't have a fire
without it being properly laid.

1245
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,276
I mean...

1246
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,476
- That should be about right.
- What should?

1247
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,711
Never mind. You know what you've got to do.
Lay it on good and thick.

1248
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,869
Oh, Sid, I can't do it!

1249
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,952
Is there a better way to show Sophie
you're not interested in me?

1250
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,349
Very well, but don't blame me for what happens.

1251
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,396
That's a good girl. Come on.

1252
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,948
Come on. Come on.

1253
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:09,514
Very well. I'm willing to accept that there has
been nothing between you and Miss Dempsey.

1254
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,194
She'll have to go, of course.

1255
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,236
Go? But she's been here for years.

1256
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,710
She has security and comfort here.
She'd never get it anywhere else.

1257
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,917
Well, she's not getting it here any more.

1258
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,553
It's your choice, Percival. Her or me.

1259
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,959
Oh, very well, then.

1260
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,996
Oh, that's settled, then.

1261
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,479
(Knock at door)
- Come in.

1262
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,516
There's a woman here to see you.

1263
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,160
A woman? What woman?

1264
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,276
"Just tell him Pussycat," she said,

1265
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,873
<i>"and he'll know who you mean."</i>

1266
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,997
Pussycat? I don't know any Pussycats.

1267
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,799
You'd better tell her.
She's waiting in the drawing room.

1268
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,111
Oh, I don't understand.
She must have got the wrong house.

1269
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,156
Um, excuse me.

1270
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,079
- Madam, I think there's been some mistake.
- Oh, Percival!

1271
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:03,597
I'm sorry, my darling, I just had to come.
I can't bear it any longer without you.

1272
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,398
Madam, please try to control yourself.

1273
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,029
How can you ask me to control myself
after all we've been to one another?

1274
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,237
<i>You who've never shown any control</i>
<i>where I'm concerned.</i>

1275
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,039
- What?
- I need you, Percival!

1276
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,873
The nights have been, oh, so empty!

1277
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,714
<i>I don't care how hard you beat me,</i>
<i>as long as you love me occasionally.</i>

1278
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,519
Oh, madam, please keep your voice down!

1279
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,556
You can be heard halfway through the house.

1280
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,077
Look here, I don't know who you are,
or what you want...

1281
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,116
Oh! What are you doing?

1282
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,193
I want you to take me.
I'm yours. You know it. Take me.

1283
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,431
<i>But I don't want you! Stop it! Stop it at once!</i>

1284
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,954
No, you've found someone else!
I know it. I can feel it!

1285
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,996
- Well, stop feeling it.
- Oh!

1286
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,719
Oh, Percival, how could you desert me like this?

1287
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,917
What's to become of me and the baby?

1288
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,037
The baby? What baby? I don't know any babies.

1289
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,271
<i>I won't give you up, you hear?</i>
<i>I won't! You're mine!</i>

1290
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,035
- You'll always be mine.
- Help, Miss Dempsey! Help, Miss Dempsey!

1291
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,473
Ah!

1292
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,028
Oh, no!

1293
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,998
<i>You! Esme Crowfoot!</i>

1294
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,993
You filthy, depraved beast!

1295
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,036
No, Sophia, please, come back!

1296
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,874
No, you don't need her, my darling,
you've got me!

1297
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,393
Get off!

1298
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,835
<i>Get off me! You've no right.</i>

1299
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,914
Bingo!

1300
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,396
Where is she? Where is she?

1301
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,119
If you mean Pussycat, in there.

1302
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,116
Ah, Gripper!

1303
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,516
- What are you?
- You lousy swine. I'll kill you!

1304
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,751
- What are you doing? You're all mad!
- I'm mad, all right.

1305
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,952
Take your hands off him, you great bully, you!

1306
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,156
Ow!

1307
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,233
Why, Miss Dempsey!

1308
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,394
Oh, ta!

1309
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,399
(Laughs)

1310
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,957
Sophie, what happened?

1311
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,393
<i>Did you forget something?</i>

1312
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:42,395
No, I was just thinking about what you were
saying yesterday and, of course, you're right.

1313
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,311
You can't run the business without me.

1314
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,755
- I thought you were getting married?
- No.

1315
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,239
Oh, oh.

1316
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,912
Well, I'm very glad to hear it.

1317
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,468
Fancy that, eh? The old firm back in business.

1318
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,189
I think we ought to celebrate.
I'll nip down to the off-licence and get something.

1319
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,236
Oh.

1320
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,596
Lend us a couple...

1321
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,636
Thank you.

1322
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,709
- Oh!
- Hello.

1323
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,796
Mr Bedsop!

1324
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,235
What are you doing here?

1325
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:22,552
Well, actually, I thought it was time
I gave you a report on Mr Bliss.

1326
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,430
Oh, you're not still following him?
Oh, I am sorry, I should have told you to stop.

1327
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,159
Well, I think you'll find it's all been worthwhile.

1328
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,312
Particularly when you hear
whom he was with last night.

1329
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,356
Oh, I'm sure it...

1330
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,396
- Last night?
- Oh, yes.

1331
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,517
He met a Miss Esme Crowfoot.

1332
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:44,870
Really? Do go on, Mr Bedsop.

1333
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,029
Sophie! Come and get it.

1334
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,070
Here, look. How about that? Champers.

1335
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,038
- Oh, very nice. May I crack it?
- Yes, go on, go ahead.

1336
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,076
Thank you.

1337
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,196
What did you go and do that for?

1338
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,236
You wretch! You rotten swine!

1339
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:17,030
Don't think I don't know you sent that poor
wretched woman into Mr Snooper's last night.

1340
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,588
Well... Well, what if I did?

1341
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,990
- I only did it cos I don't want to lose you.
- You've lost me now, for good.

1342
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,036
No, wait, wait. I want to marry you.

1343
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,076
You want to what?

1344
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:31,199
Marry you. Well, I mean, that is, in time.
I don't want to rush you into anything.

1345
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,350
All right. All right. Next week, then.

1346
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,953
You heard that, Mr Bedsop?

1347
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,439
I've got it down.

1348
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,557
You won't regret it, Sid, I promise you.

1349
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,596
I know that, darling.

1350
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,830
I'll tell you what, why don't we have a booze-up

1351
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,229
and invite all the couples
we've brought together?

1352
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,470
- Careful, that's going to cost money.
- So what?

1353
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,473
I know a fellow in catering and if we charge them
a guinea a head, we might make a few bob.

1354
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,039
Oh, I love you!

1355

1357
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,871
Ladies and gents, I realise that our marriage
has come as a bit of a shock to you all,

01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,557
you happy couples that
we've had the pleasure of bringing together.

1360
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:44,236
<i>Just to look around this room and see</i>
<i>so many contented, ideally-matched couples</i>

1361
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,392
<i>is reward in itself for the trouble</i>
<i>we have been to on your behalf.</i>

1362
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,994
You, like Sophie and me, have been dead lucky,

1363
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:54,153
<i>because you've had the benefit of</i>
<i>our expert knowledge and scientific advice.</i>

1364
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,791
So, I am not asking you only to drink to our
health and happiness, but to your own. Cheers.

# For He's A Jolly Good Fellow

1366
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,233
(Tune trails off)

1367
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,074
(Clears throat)

1368
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,311
- 'Ere, that's it!
- What are you on about now?

1369
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,356
That suit he's wearing.

1370
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,512
That was the one
that was drying in your flat that night.

1371
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,556
Stop it, Gripper, don't make a scene.

1372
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:37,394
So, it was you. I'll bloomin' well kill you!

1373
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:41,598
What are you talking about? He's gone potty.
Don't pay any attention to him, Sophie.

1374
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,792
I'll deal with you later!

1375
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,836
Oh, you will, will you?

1376
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,795
Don't you laugh at him, you little squirt!

1377
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,476
How dare you, you old bag!

1378
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,636
- Ow!

# Strauss waltz

1380
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,356
(Laughs)

1381
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,675
Keep 'em coming.

1382
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,790
GRIPPER: I'll tear you apart!
