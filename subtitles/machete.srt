2
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:37,235
We're federal agents, we are not martyrs!

3
00:00:39,485 --> 00:00:40,735
This is suicide!

4
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:44,402
She is just one of many abductions.

5
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:46,943
Why is this abduction so special!

6
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,985
Is it because she's a witness against
the Torrez?

7
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:57,443
She is probably caught, and drugged.

8
00:00:57,568 --> 00:00:59,402
We do not have to do this!

9
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,152
If not us...

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,652
... Who?

11
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:07,777
I told you to stay still!

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,443
Do not try to capture the Torrez!

13
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:12,777
Turn around now!

14
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:15,360
Machete, you son of a bitch!

15
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:17,693
Listen to orders!

16
00:01:17,818 --> 00:01:22,568
You'll eventually kill us all!
Wait for reinforcements!

17
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:49,902
Whatever happens...

18
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:54,443
I'm with you...

19
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:56,610
... Boss.

20
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:00,610
This is the BOSS...

21
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:23,152
Sorry.

22
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:15,735
Get dressed.

23
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:19,402
It's too hot for clothes.

24
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:39,943
You saving me from Torrez?

25
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:41,735
You've got balls!

26
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:44,777
That looks like me.

27
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,110
What's this long hard thing?

28
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,443
My Machete.

29
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,485
Is it sharp?

30
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,193
Very...

31
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:58,818
Good...

32
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:18,860
I got him

33
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,277
Stupid FUCK...

34
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:28,318
I told you to stay away asshole.

35
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:34,068
If you had listened to my orders
you would not have been caught.

36
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:36,360
How did I do?

37
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,152
Excellent my love.

38
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:41,693
Excellent...

39
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:49,068
This is what happens when they insist
to be heroes.

40
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,985
Why are you so insistent?

41
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:55,777
I own the entire force...
And not just here in Mexico.

42
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,735
I own the DEA... I own
the Marshals...

43
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,818
Why can't I own you?

44
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:05,485
Why don't you take the money
I offered you to look the other way?

45
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,402
What's your price?

46
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,193
Maybe I should ask your
wife.

47
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:13,735
Bring her in here.

48
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,652
No!

49
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:22,735
Sara!

50
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:27,818
Your daughter... she's in
school right now.

51
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:29,235
No?

52
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:33,193
I don't think so.

53
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,318
The honorable way to die...
is to cut off your head.

54
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:45,610
But.

55
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,235
You don't deserve to die honorably.

56
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:52,777
Burn it!

57
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:48,818
Joining us right now we have Franklin Jones.

58
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:52,652
Deputy Director of our local Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) office.

59
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:53,735
Thank you and pleasure to be here.

60
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:56,277
What steps are you taking to
secure our borders?

61
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:59,277
ICE is working with local law enforcement
to improve patrols...

62
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:02,652
but there's over 2000 miles of border between
Mexico and the U.S.

63
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:07,110
And over half of that is here in Texas,

64
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,568
there's a whole support network.

65
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,527
That not only helps illegal aliens get

66
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:14,652
across but is helping them get settled.
Once they are here.

67
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:16,735
We need to uncover and dismantle this
network.

68
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:20,860
It's our top priority and our most
talented ICE agents are investigating them now.

69
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:27,068
Agent Nevada: Day 23 of surveillance for
Operation Network.

70
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:32,193
The Operation is suspected to be run by
a woman named Loose.

71
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:34,193
Codename: She.

72
00:08:34,193 --> 00:08:36,443
Tacos Cafe! TACOS!

73
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:39,527
Loose operates a taco's truck at the labour site.

74
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:45,027
There's a interesting...

75
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:45,693
face.

76
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,652
No! That's ok.

77
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:54,360
Thank you.

78
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:59,110
He's not...

79
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:08,527
Run through database for
possible criminal background.

80
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:11,402
Male, Hispanic, scars, tattoo's

81
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,402
Don't fuck with me, I don't
fuck with you attitude.

82
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:18,735
Hey!

83
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,527
So we need to attack the problem at it's source.

84
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,360
You work today
and pay me tomorrow.

85
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:26,568
Hi, lady

86
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,443
You need a gardener?

87
00:09:48,402 --> 00:09:50,527
Come on. Stand back.

88
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:54,777
Hurry!

89
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:59,360
We have not got.
You can not leave us here!

90
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,402
Move!

91
00:10:00,402 --> 00:10:01,902
She is sick.

92
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:14,985
Roundup time!

93
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,027
Look at them!

94
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:38,485
Speak english?

95
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:46,610
Well, I don't speak much Mexican neither.

96
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:49,277
You know...

97
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,277
You're trespassing...

98
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,777
on my daddy's land.

99
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:06,568
Jesus Van! Can't you see
she's been childed?

100
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,610
If it gets born here.
It gets to be a citizen.

101
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,360
No different than you or me.

102
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:17,610
I know most people don't like us.

103
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:21,485
Course... Vigilante's

104
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:25,693
It's really about vigilance.

105
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:32,693
Somebody’s gonna watch out
for this great nation of ours.

106
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,443
Otherwise...

107
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,027
Texas will become...

108
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:38,443
Mexico once again.

109
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,610
Who's gonna stop it senator?

110
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,110
I am.

111
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,443
Welcome to America.

112
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:57,110
You catch all that?

113
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:00,277
Burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters
are going to like that!

114
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:01,777
A lot.

115
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,860
The infestation has begun...

116
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,652
parasites have crossed our borders...

117
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:09,277
have sickening our country...

118
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:10,943
leeching off out system...

119
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:13,277
destroying us from the inside.

120
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:15,277
But Senator John McLauglin

121
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,777
has a plan of attack.

122
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,193
He'll fight to keep illegal immigrants
OUT!

123
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:55,068
Hey!

124
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:56,610
Ugly!

125
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,652
Want to fight?

126
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:03,652
Don't tell me you don't wanna earn
$500 in five minutes.

127
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:08,860
That's my man!

128
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,110
Bet's! Place your bets!

129
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:20,818
Fight!

130
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:06,943
Thanks.

131
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:24,735
Can I have a beans and cheese.
And a Cafe Ole.

132
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:27,568
Ain't got no cafe Ole.

133
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,277
Regular coffee then

134
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,277
Oh! hold the spit please.

135
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:45,943
Why do you pretend to come here
just for coffee?

136
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:48,235
I'm not pretending.

137
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,902
I like my coffee cheap and greasy.

138
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:52,693
I can refuse service to anyone.

139
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:55,152
Still the American way.

140
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:56,860
When they are citizens.

141
00:14:58,152 --> 00:14:59,277
Got your papers?

142
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,402
Same as the last time you checked.

143
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,485
And the time before that.

144
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:06,652
And the time before that!

145
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,068
Got yours?

146
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:11,318
Same as the last time you checked.

147
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:14,068
You think what you do is right?

148
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:15,818
Taking your brothers and sisters in?

149
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:19,360
Deporting them to their own
personal health?

150
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,777
It's the law.

151
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,068
There are many laws.

152
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:23,693
There sure are...

153
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,818
Immigration fraud...

154
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:27,985
Aiding and illegal entry

155
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:30,277
Insanitary food processing...

156
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,277
But you wouldn't know anything about that
would you?

157
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:33,818
Can I get my taco's

158
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:40,235
Who's she?

159
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:43,152
I heard she runs an underground network.

160
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,110
How the hell would I know?

161
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:47,235
I just make tacos and I sell them.

162
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,277
To the workers of this site.

163
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:52,360
It fills their bellies other
than hate.

164
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,318
Funny.

165
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,318
Sounds like something she would say.

166
00:15:58,318 --> 00:15:59,610
Catch you later.

167
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,443
In the race for State Senator...

168
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:06,693
Latest polls are showing...

169
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:09,985
a sharp decline in support for incumbent
Senator John McLaughlin.

170
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:12,027
And his hard-line position on immigration.

171
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,318
Get in.

172
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:32,235
Fellow dodged it forever.

173
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:37,485
125 perceptive.

174
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:39,568
Sewage.

175
00:16:40,027 --> 00:16:41,360
You ever killed anyone before?

176
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,027
You know this guy?

177
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:30,443
Senator John McLaughlin...

178
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:33,693
Independent from cocksucker county.

179
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:36,985
Built his reputation on being
a hardliner against wetbacks.

180
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,193
Gets worse.

181
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,777
Yes... If he has his brothers.
He'll send you back to old Mehico.

182
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:45,568
That's his platform.

183
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:49,693
Ship them all back before first making them
built a wall along the border for no pay.

184
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,818
Thank you very much get the fuck out.

185
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:54,277
But what the state senator fails to understand is...

186
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:56,568
the state runs the illegal labour.

187
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,193
Thrives on it.

188
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,235
Keeps costs down.

189
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:01,277
Keeps the wheels turning.

190
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:04,652
We bust that up
and we're fucked.

191
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:06,568
My words.

192
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:10,277
Now I'm guessing you don't
have papers.

193
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:11,943
As you well know...

194
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:13,402
illegal immigrants like yourself...

195
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:16,152
will be forced out of the
country in alarming numbers

196
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,402
So for the sake of both
our people's.

197
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,652
The senator must die.

198
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:40,152
And for that. I will give you
150 thousand dollars cash.

199
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,027
Get someone else.

200
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:57,818
No time.

201
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,443
This job has to happen tomorrow.

202
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,568
I want you to take this cash,
do the job and disappear.

203
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:12,943
How long would it take you to get this kind of money?

204
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:17,527
5... 10... 15 years?

205
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,693
You can do a lot of good things with this.

206
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:23,318
You deserve it.

207
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:30,652
Now I can't make you do this.

208
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:34,902
But I can make damn sure something
happens to you if you don't.

209
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:37,610
Are you in?

210
00:19:43,902 --> 00:19:45,027
Have a look at this...

211
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,443
Straight line design,

212
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:47,735
Laser designated scope.

213
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:53,318
You can shoot the pecker off
a mosquito at a thousand yards.

214
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,360
And keep the balls unruffled.

215
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:01,693
Machete?

216
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,735
That's only good if you wanna make a
brutal point.

217
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,652
But it's low tech. Completely
unsuited to our purposes.

218
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:07,985
Backup...

219
00:20:08,402 --> 00:20:09,985
Here's your backup.

220
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:11,527
Me.

221
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:13,235
You call or text if you have any problems,

222
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:15,943
or delays. You need to be on that
roof by 1 pm sharp.

223
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:25,152
Now put a bullet in the senator
by 1:04pm.

224
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,193
Get up!

225
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:21,777
God damn April.

226
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:24,527
My business partner have very little tolerance
for bullshit.

227
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:32,402
This is a second operation in the last six months,

228
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:34,318
that I have to close down
because of your mentally...

229
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,027
I told you a thousand times.

230
00:21:38,027 --> 00:21:40,360
You need something you come to me
directly.

231
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,443
You do not go to these labs.

232
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,777
You got something to say to me?

233
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:02,360
Sorry daddy.

234
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:35,777
What's this?

235
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:37,277
$150 thousand

236
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:38,318
Cash.

237
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:40,985
Are you out of your mind?

238
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,402
The Network got me across once.

239
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:45,402
Use this.

240
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,277
For the people you help.

241
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,610
I don't know how you know what you know.

242
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:52,485
But I'm glad I know you.

243
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:58,402
What'd you want?

244
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,152
Here.

245
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:06,193
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Mr. Senator John McLaughlin.

246
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:12,193
I want to thank you all for coming
out today!

247
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,860
And I want to thank this forum from the bottom
of my heart.

248
00:23:21,152 --> 00:23:22,568
Because we have been tested.

249
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,652
Tested by fire!

250
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:28,860
Our borders have been put to the test.
And let me tell you we have failed that test.

251
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:32,985
The aliens,  the infiltrators, the outsiders...

252
00:23:32,985 --> 00:23:34,652
They come right across by light of day,

253
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:35,693
by dark at night.

254
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:37,610
They'll bleed us. They'll parasites.

255
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,610
They'll bleed us til we're a city,

256
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:40,193
a county, a state.

257
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:43,277
a nation til we're all bled out.

258
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,527
Now make no mistake
we are at war.

259
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:49,652
Every time an illegal dances across
our border.

260
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:52,735
It is an act of aggression against
this sovereign state.

261
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,443
A covert act of terrorism.

262
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,235
Everywhere I go in this glorious state.

263
00:23:58,235 --> 00:23:59,193
People are talking about change.

264
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:00,568
I say why change?

265
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:04,318
This is a great state founded
on the principles of liberty.

266
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,902
I don't want to change that.

267
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,443
Our rightful citizens are a hardworking Americans,

268
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:11,902
who have earned their paychecks...

269
00:24:11,902 --> 00:24:14,110
by the grit of their gut and
the sweat of their brow!

270
00:24:16,027 --> 00:24:17,360
I don't want to change that!

271
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:19,902
Change! That they want change!

272
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:21,110
Change the law!

273
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:22,068
Open the doors!

274
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:23,860
Red rover! Red rover!

275
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,527
Let the terrorist come over!

276
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:29,027
Let me tell you what change that will bring!

277
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,235
68 cents!

278
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,068
The jingle jangle of the pennies in your pocket.

279
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:37,235
Because the scavengers, the leeches,
the parasites,

280
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:38,818
are walking away with your money.

281
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:42,402
While you're left with the change.

282
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:46,110
So I wanna say one more thing.

283
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,235
Who you gonna vote for?

284
00:25:04,943 --> 00:25:05,860
There!

285
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Up there! I saw someone shot from up there!

286
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:11,068
Get him to Fort Briggs!

287
00:25:19,027 --> 00:25:20,068
Roger! I'm on my way.

288
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:36,527
Go ahead.

289
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,652
Shoot him Nacho.

290
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:39,943
Cos right after that.

291
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:42,235
The three of us

292
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:43,818
Are gonna shoot one of you.

293
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:52,110
Shit!

294
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:04,235
Try it.

295
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:05,943
Go ahead... Pacho.

296
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,818
I'll grease your chips all
over this fucking alley.

297
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:17,443
This is fucking big.

298
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:19,652
This guy took a shot at a representative.

299
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:20,693
No! A Senator.

300
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:21,777
This is fucking high.

301
00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:23,818
The guy can die and we caught him.

302
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:24,860
Hell we did!

303
00:26:25,735 --> 00:26:28,152
And they'll gonna hang your ass
like Saddam!

304
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,652
Look I'm gonna call the boss
unless you wanna do it.

305
00:26:31,068 --> 00:26:32,110
Yeah, you go ahead.

306
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,943
We got the Mexican bird that fell off the rooftop!

307
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:37,943
Bring him to the basement.

308
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:42,027
He stills thinks we're cops.

309
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:43,818
Well of course he will think that.

310
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,568
We frisked him, we cuffed him, we
throw him in the car.

311
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:49,527
Apprehended him just like the
real cops do.

312
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,235
I didn't frisked him.

313
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:54,610
Yes, you did.

314
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:55,818
Man, I'm telling you I didn’t...

315
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:58,985
Oh! Sweet Jesus.

316
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:08,277
Oh! DAMN!

317
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:19,485
Shocking news this hour.

318
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:23,902
Senator John McLaughlin was shot
in the leg this afternoon by an unknown gunman.

319
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,777
The Senator was immediately driven to Parklane hospital,

320
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:29,652
where he was reportedly in good and
stable condition.

321
00:27:29,652 --> 00:27:34,110
Video taken at the rally indicate the
gunman may have been of Mexican descent.

322
00:27:35,402 --> 00:27:37,943
Senator McLaughlin have been
very vocal against immigration.

323
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:40,402
And campaigns for stricter border patrols.

324
00:27:56,568 --> 00:27:57,610
Boss.

325
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:58,985
Video.

326
00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:03,318
You see what I am sending you Mr. Torrez.

327
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:05,610
It's coming on my screen now.

328
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,610
That's campaign gold.

329
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:12,860
I put my contributions were for the Senator's re-election.

330
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,902
Not his retirement.

331
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,318
McLaughlin is in a guaranteed win.

332
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:18,193
And in a new session as promised,

333
00:28:18,193 --> 00:28:20,818
he'll ramrod through everything we asked for.

334
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,402
Pause!

335
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:23,860
Go back.

336
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:27,943
Who's this?

337
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:28,985
Nobody.

338
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,818
A day labourer from the streets.

339
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:31,902
He won't be missed.

340
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:33,568
Is he dead?

341
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,402
Dead or dying on a rooftop.
That's what you mean.

342
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:38,068
What the fuck is it! Asshole...

343
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:40,402
Dead or dying?

344
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,360
He'll be dead within minutes.
I guarantee.

345
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:47,485
For your sake.

346
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:52,860
What?

347
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:57,652
It's me. It's done. I think he's toast.

348
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:00,068
Don't think! Verify! Check the
morgue,

349
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:01,985
check the hospitals, check everywhere.

350
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:09,193
Most do not give illegals
standard treatment in hospitals.

351
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:10,985
But thou art with us.

352
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:13,402
Nobody knows you're here.

353
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:16,818
You were brought here under the name John Doe,

354
00:29:18,318 --> 00:29:19,360
as a mere spectator.

355
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:22,818
Is that him?
Yes.

356
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:24,652
Dr. Felix wants to see him.

357
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:26,318
Quietly...

358
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,777
Did you see where the bullet rebound.

359
00:29:29,777 --> 00:29:32,402
It was stopped by another bullet that
was fused and lodged there.

360
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:34,818
If he hadn't been shot before.
He'll be dead now.

361
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,277
There's actually a lesson in there somewhere .

362
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,943
I can feel your eyeballs on my uterus.

363
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:41,902
Woah, woah, woah, at least it's not on your colon.

364
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:43,693
Well, actually did you know that the...

365
00:29:43,693 --> 00:29:46,693
the human intestines is ten times longer
than the length of the body?

366
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:47,735
Wait!

367
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:49,818
So the human intestines is
60 feet long?

368
00:29:49,818 --> 00:29:50,860
It's true.

369
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:53,860
The hero has awoken!

370
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:58,985
My friend! You are safe, they are
from The Network.

371
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:01,318
They will take good care of you.

372
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:03,527
Leave him alone.

373
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:08,360
Hello, what can I do for you?

374
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:09,943
What can you do for me?

375
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:12,360
I'm looking for a gentleman
that was just brought in.

376
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,735
Probably into ICU.

377
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:16,860
Where might I find him?

378
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,693
You wanna go straight down
the hall, to your right...

379
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,193
Make a left, two rights and another left.

380
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:24,235
And you'll be right there.

381
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:27,985
You sure about that?

382
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:34,568
I'm going this way.

383
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:38,235
Someone is coming.

384
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:40,152
We got trouble.

385
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,860
Got another way outta here?

386
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,902
No other exits.

387
00:30:58,027 --> 00:30:59,110
Oh... you don't wanna mess with that.

388
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:00,443
That's a skull scraper.

389
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:01,818
We use that to scrape the bones clean.

390
00:31:03,277 --> 00:31:04,818
And those can cut through flesh
just like butter.

391
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:11,110
Pass that tank.

392
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,652
Hold it!

393
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:54,652
Boss ain't gonna like this.

394
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,943
What are we gonna tell him?

395
00:32:59,152 --> 00:32:59,985
Ooops.

396
00:33:27,693 --> 00:33:28,735
Evana.

397
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:30,277
I'm on my lunch break sir.

398
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:32,068
Lunch break is over. All hell's breaking loose,

399
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:34,068
Some took a shot at Senator McLaughlin.

400
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:35,402
It was a illegal.

401
00:33:35,318 --> 00:33:36,777
I'm watching it right now.

402
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:39,110
This amateur video was taken just outside
county hospital,

403
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,027
just after the failed attempt to
assassinate Senator John McLaughlin.

404
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:44,443
Authorities believe that this suspect
is extremely dangerous...

405
00:33:44,443 --> 00:33:45,818
Son of a bitch...

406
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:47,527
No! not you sir.

407
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,152
I've seen him before.

408
00:33:51,235 --> 00:33:52,360
Yes sir. I'm on my way.

409
00:33:52,693 --> 00:33:54,110
He maybe in this country illegally.

410
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:58,152
And that he is of course to be considered
to be armed and extremely dangerous.

411
00:34:03,818 --> 00:34:06,652
You're all over the TV! Cabron!
Come on get inside!

412
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:08,318
Hurry!

413
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:12,527
The shots fired on Senator
McLaughlin today maybe,

414
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:15,568
just the shot in the arm
his campaign needed.

415
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,652
New numbers indicate that he has
now taken a commanding,

416
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:20,902
led from the wake of today's incident.

417
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,068
Since today's shooting. Others agree that

418
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:25,568
border security should be heavily enforced.

419
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:29,068
Yes, hold the illegals responsible!
Close the border!

420
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:30,693
Eh... yeah!

421
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:34,068
Didn't you cross the border to
get here Jack?

422
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:37,610
Well, we're almost there.
If they close the border, fine by me.

423
00:34:38,068 --> 00:34:39,277
Nocha!

424
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:42,235
"Cona" Opinions should be like.

425
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:44,818
Waay!

426
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:50,735
You didn't have a choice,
Of course I believe you.

427
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:53,277
why else would you give me the money?

428
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:55,610
They'll be looking  for your ass.

429
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,027
You'll be safe here.

430
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:04,068
Try not to bleed on the bed.

431
00:35:28,902 --> 00:35:31,860
Are you "She"?

432
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:37,818
"She" brings hope.

433
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,652
"She" rights the wrongs.

434
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:44,693
Unfortunately, "She's" a myth.

435
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,443
Just someone I made up to
led The Network.

436
00:35:49,027 --> 00:35:51,443
At first, I just wanted to help
people get settled,

437
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,110
give them food, find them work.

438
00:35:55,402 --> 00:35:57,402
Now there's a war
against us.

439
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:59,777
Von and his border vigilantes.

440
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,277
Hunting us down like dogs.

441
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:03,860
And there's no one there to stop them.

442
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,568
You can...

443
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,527
You're a fighter

444
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,735
Only when there is something
worth fighting for.

445
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:15,860
Is there?

446
00:36:19,152 --> 00:36:20,193
Always.

447
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:33,485
When the sun rises, you should be good.

448
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,485
Don't start something
that you can't finish.

449
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:41,193
Machete.

450
00:36:42,152 --> 00:36:43,152
You know me?

451
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:45,027
I know the legend.

452
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,943
Maybe the legend's better.

453
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,360
I'll be the judge of that.

454
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:15,485
Where are you? Mr. Mysterious?

455
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,360
Oh my god...

456
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:49,318
Codename: Machete
Former Federal.

457
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:50,985
Gunning the Senator down in the street!

458
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:52,402
What on earth were they thinking?

459
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,443
Sometimes I worry about April and
what kinda world we're living here.

460
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,193
A fucked up world.

461
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,027
I'd ought to wash your mouth out with soap.

462
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:04,318
Give me another that taco.

463
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:06,777
Someone took a shot at a senator.
What world would you call it?

464
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:08,360
A fucked up world.

465
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,902
Like two peas in a pod.

466
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:13,027
So! Hmm...

467
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,235
I think David is going to ask me
to marry him.

468
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:19,777
But I have my priorities.

469
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:20,735
School and a career.

470
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:22,068
Salsa!

471
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:24,485
Actually I was thinking more
about my modeling.

472
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:27,902
You are a very pretty girl April,

473
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,818
but that's tough enough to crack.

474
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:33,568
I know all about cracking nuts.

475
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:39,985
Do you even know how many hits I
get on my website?

476
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,652
You own a website? She has a
website? Did you know about this?

477
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:45,527
I know all about what the online public wants.

478
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,235
And they want ME!

479
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,360
All of ME!

480
00:38:51,568 --> 00:38:53,735
That does it. I'm sending
you to a convent.

481
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,068
What?

482
00:38:55,943 --> 00:38:57,902
He's loose. He got away.

483
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:00,818
God Damn! How hard is it for you to kill a
god damn day labourer?

484
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:02,735
You get to that corner where I
picked him up.

485
00:39:02,735 --> 00:39:03,777
You find him!

486
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:05,068
Do IT!

487
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:18,277
Seen a big wagon?

488
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:21,568
No... No speak english.

489
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,068
Speak. 45?

490
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,985
Where's the tacos truck lady at?

491
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:32,902
Hey! I don't know man. I haven't seen
her this morning. She's late.

492
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:35,902
She...

493
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,068
You know where you lives...

494
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:33,610
Alright... go get him.

495
00:41:49,652 --> 00:41:51,402
You're all over the god damn TV.

496
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:54,068
Get in!

497
00:41:54,777 --> 00:41:55,860
Agent

498
00:41:59,152 --> 00:42:01,777
You're the second beautiful
girl that picked me up today.

499
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,902
Exploding houses!

500
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,193
Bodies falling from the sky!

501
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:13,027
Jesus Christ Machete...

502
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,818
You're a walking SHIT MAGNET!

503
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,527
Ya! I know who you are...

504
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:19,360
I'm Santana Evira.

505
00:42:20,235 --> 00:42:21,943
Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE).

506
00:42:22,652 --> 00:42:23,693
ICE.

507
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:26,027
Fuckin' A! La Migra (immigration)...

508
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:29,610
Don't worry, I won't ship you back,
if you tell me what I need to know.

509
00:42:29,402 --> 00:42:30,818
Working my way up.

510
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:33,568
I can't be busting people like tacos
stands anymore.

511
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,568
Well, I'm probably related to half of them.

512
00:42:35,818 --> 00:42:37,610
You need me more than I need you.

513
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,818
Come on.

514
00:42:38,818 --> 00:42:42,818
You know all the cops in this
state are hunting you down for trying to kill a senator.

515
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,027
I wasn't gonna kill him.

516
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:47,443
Just gonna shoot him in the neck,

517
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:50,110
Stop him from saying all those
stupid things.

518
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,985
It was a set up.

519
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:53,777
There was another shooter there.

520
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:55,068
There was another shooter?

521
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:56,110
Who?

522
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,360
Drive!

523
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:10,777
Drive.

524
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:19,610
I know what they did to your family.

525
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:21,610
And if I were you I wouldn't trust
anyone neither,

526
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,943
but it's different here.

527
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,068
Laws are enforced.

528
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:28,443
And people control them.
Not drug lords.

529
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:31,985
The system works here...

530
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,152
Says you.

531
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,277
I started working on the night shift
taking out the trash.

532
00:43:37,027 --> 00:43:38,485
But I worked my way up.

533
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:41,277
As translator, assistant...

534
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:45,277
Now I'm special agent in
charge of investigations.

535
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:48,777
Sounds like they still got you
taking out the trash.

536
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,943
Let me take you in...

537
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:53,193
Put you into witness protection.

538
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:57,318
All you got to do is tell me who
hired you to take out the senator.

539
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,693
Fine.

540
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,568
Holy Shit.

541
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:16,652
You mean to tell me that a Mexican daily is a
god damn federale?

542
00:44:16,568 --> 00:44:21,860
That's right, CIA, FBI, DEA, all
rolled in one mean fucking burrito.

543
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:24,360
Is this the man who you assigned to kill Machete?

544
00:44:25,693 --> 00:44:26,777
Yes.

545
00:44:27,443 --> 00:44:29,860
And so far you failed.

546
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:32,652
So far.

547
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,693
I'm sorry to see you have a high tolerance
for failure Bon nita.

548
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:38,610
I don't...

549
00:44:51,985 --> 00:44:52,943
not bad

550
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:54,985
The last time we spoke you could have mentioned
that he was a god damn federale!

551
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:56,027
God Dammit!

552
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,818
Notoriously is hard to kill,
trust me.

553
00:44:58,818 --> 00:44:59,860
I've tried.

554
00:45:00,985 --> 00:45:02,777
Well, you didn't try with the guy I'm calling in.

555
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:06,777
The very best the great state of Texas has to offer.

556
00:45:08,277 --> 00:45:11,568
Osiris Amanpour.

557
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:13,777
If Machete is captured alive.

558
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,985
He'll expose my entire operation.

559
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,985
You have 24 hours take him down,

560
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:21,568
or I'll come over there myself...

561
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,610
And I'll kill him myself.

562
00:45:32,277 --> 00:45:35,110
Sorry, my friend.

563
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,735
My grandfather always says you
can solve any problem with food.

564
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:42,652
And you my friend,

565
00:45:43,902 --> 00:45:45,610
have plenty of problems.

566
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:50,152
So who you working for?

567
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,068
Who wants the senator dead?

568
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,402
Is it The Network?

569
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:55,110
Luz?

570
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:56,318
She doesn't know anything about it.

571
00:45:57,818 --> 00:45:58,860
Network either.

572
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:00,777
The man who hired me...

573
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:01,777
was a Mexican.

574
00:46:02,152 --> 00:46:03,110
Really

575
00:46:04,402 --> 00:46:06,943
So he was just a random guy who says...

576
00:46:06,943 --> 00:46:08,693
hey, wanna kill the senator today?

577
00:46:09,277 --> 00:46:10,402
And you are like cool?

578
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:13,485
I was afraid he wanted receptive work.

579
00:46:13,485 --> 00:46:17,735
Instead, he offered me $150,000
to kill the senator.

580
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:19,568
That's a lot of money.

581
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,652
So that's why you did it?

582
00:46:23,777 --> 00:46:24,985
For the money.

583
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:27,693
Look, Machete.

584
00:46:30,443 --> 00:46:32,193
You're not legal in this country.

585
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:36,277
And after what happened in Mexico
there is no way you're going home.

586
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,318
So basically, you're a man with no country.

587
00:46:41,777 --> 00:46:44,068
And lucky for you. I can help you out.

588
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,360
Look at me.

589
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:48,360
I can get you papers.

590
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:52,485
But you've got to let me bring you in.

591
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,360
I'm gonna find the guy who did this.

592
00:47:05,027 --> 00:47:06,985
And bring him to you.

593
00:47:07,527 --> 00:47:09,318
Why should I trust you?

594
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,485
Because we are both cops.

595
00:47:23,152 --> 00:47:26,193
I'd tell you to stop, but
I know you took the bullets.

596
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,902
Luz!

597
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:39,568
Luz!

598
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:43,902
You wouldn't think they'll take me down
that easily did ya?

599
00:47:45,943 --> 00:47:48,360
You're alive.
But your house man!

600
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,027
It was small...

601
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:52,943
I've got something to show you guys,
come on...

602
00:48:05,735 --> 00:48:07,568
Told you they were gunning for us.

603
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,943
Who knows what they'll gonna do next.

604
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:12,652
Holy shit, Luz!

605
00:48:12,735 --> 00:48:14,152
I didn't now that you were this loaded.

606
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:16,068
You got more heat than the Popos (police).

607
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,902
It's a good start, but we need a lot more.

608
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:19,652
Need it for what?

609
00:48:20,235 --> 00:48:22,402
La Revoluzion. (The Revolution).

610
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:25,068
Van and his men are coming for us.

611
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,693
We need to be ready.

612
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,235
I'm not gonna be around forever.

613
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:33,277
If anything happens, you need to tell Machete
the people need him.

614
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,110
Who exactly is this Machete?

615
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:39,277
That's him...

616
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:41,943
he's the one.

617
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,318
Hands up!

618
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:45,110
Against the wall.

619
00:48:45,735 --> 00:48:47,443
All of you, move it!

620
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:53,277
Where's Machete?

621
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:54,943
Shit. She knows. Man!

622
00:48:54,943 --> 00:48:56,027
Amigo's gonna deport our ass back.

623
00:48:57,443 --> 00:48:59,027
Nobodies deporting anybody.

624
00:48:59,027 --> 00:49:01,818
Machete already told me you guys weren't
involved in the shooting.

625
00:49:01,943 --> 00:49:06,860
Although... I should probably
check the "carnitas".

626
00:49:08,235 --> 00:49:09,277
For lead!

627
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:11,610
What is this place anyway?

628
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:21,277
Welcome to The Network.

629
00:49:21,943 --> 00:49:23,527
These are some of the people that I've help.

630
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,943
Help them cross,

631
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:27,485
Got them jobs,

632
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,693
then make sure that they do their part.

633
00:49:30,277 --> 00:49:32,235
And this?

634
00:49:32,777 --> 00:49:34,485
These are the guys trying to stop us.

635
00:49:34,527 --> 00:49:37,610
Van Jackson and his Border Vigilantes.

636
00:49:37,818 --> 00:49:41,402
They started off with a couple of deer rifles
and a warped sense of justice.

637
00:49:41,985 --> 00:49:43,193
Then in the last year they've grown.

638
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:45,693
More guns, more men.

639
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,360
Who's funding them?

640
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,277
Whoever it is, is making a mess
of our operation.

641
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,402
And these?

642
00:49:55,235 --> 00:49:55,860
Missing

643
00:49:57,443 --> 00:50:00,610
They are supposed to have crossed.
But I have no way to track them.

644
00:50:00,693 --> 00:50:02,402
How deep does your operation go?

645
00:50:02,402 --> 00:50:03,443
Deep.

646
00:50:04,027 --> 00:50:09,027
All types, all races.
Lawyers, priests, doctors, homeboys...

647
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:11,777
That's why they call it "The Network".

648
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:14,860
The way we see it.
People risk everything to get here.

649
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,360
The system doesn't work.

650
00:50:19,193 --> 00:50:20,193
It's broken.

651
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,193
So we created our own.

652
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:27,360
You gonna burn us? huh?

653
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,860
Turn us all in?

654
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,318
no

655
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:35,235
I'm gonna walk away and pretend
I didn't see any of this.

656
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:37,443
Tell Machete I'm looking for him!

657
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,443
I am a man of faith,

658
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:54,443
I took a vow of peace.

659
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:57,027
And I don't shoot anymore.

660
00:50:57,068 --> 00:50:58,610
And you don't shoot any less either.

661
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:02,152
I don't see you or heard
from you in three years,

662
00:51:02,443 --> 00:51:05,152
And now you want me to
help you kill all these men?

663
00:51:06,402 --> 00:51:08,318
Yes, brother...

664
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,818
I mean, Padre (Father).

665
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:17,318
I'll see what I can do.

666
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:22,818
I want you to say 10 our fathers
and 10 hail marys.

667
00:51:22,985 --> 00:51:25,485
Light a candle for mom...

668
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:30,110
For funerals.
A little side business.

669
00:51:34,027 --> 00:51:37,860
I have these installed when too many things
started walking away from the altar and collection plates.

670
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,193
Imagine if we have these kinda setup
for all the federales.

671
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:42,860
This is how you get the bad guys now.

672
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,277
You catch them on video.

673
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,402
Cuban?

674
00:51:48,402 --> 00:51:49,485
Mexican.

675
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,318
Yeah, I got some of that.

676
00:51:57,693 --> 00:51:58,943
I've got something I want you to see

677
00:51:58,943 --> 00:52:01,027
Rest assure he will be caught.

678
00:52:02,693 --> 00:52:04,610
It is the first shot of the war that...

679
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,860
we didn't ask for.

680
00:52:06,193 --> 00:52:08,193
Nice way to find out your brother's in town.

681
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:10,818
Right there.

682
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,943
That's the guy that hired me.

683
00:52:14,152 --> 00:52:15,235
Michael Booth?

684
00:52:16,527 --> 00:52:17,985
He's McLaughlin's aid or some shit.

685
00:52:21,027 --> 00:52:22,068
You know him?

686
00:52:22,402 --> 00:52:25,652
Yeah... he comes in for confession
all the time.

687
00:52:25,777 --> 00:52:28,402
Lots of impure thoughts.

688
00:52:28,402 --> 00:52:30,402
Mostly about his daughter.

689
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,193
I guess I'm cheaper than a shrink (psychiatrist).

690
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:35,527
Here's his file.

691
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,193
Once he started talking about
his connection to the cartels.

692
00:52:38,193 --> 00:52:39,902
I figured. It'll come in handy.

693
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:42,360
I bet McLaughlin
doesn't even know that most of Booth's,

694
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,985
business are just a
front for his drug trade.

695
00:52:45,818 --> 00:52:49,777
What I don't understand is why he
hired you to kill his own boss.

696
00:52:49,443 --> 00:52:50,443
Don't know.

697
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,402
Gonna find out.

698
00:52:53,652 --> 00:52:55,568
It's not safe for you to be here.

699
00:52:56,152 --> 00:52:57,193
Not looking for safe.

700
00:52:57,277 --> 00:52:59,027
No I mean it's not safe
for me for YOU to be here.

701
00:52:59,485 --> 00:53:00,527
I absolve you of all your sins,

702
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:01,568
Now get the fuck out!

703
00:53:02,777 --> 00:53:03,777
Okay, bro...

704
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:07,693
But I'm borrowing your car.

705
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,318
Why are you complaining about a weak neck,

706
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:25,652
I'd said you should fucking do some sit-ups.

707
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:27,652
Hey... hey, hey boss?

708
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:29,943
Who're you?

709
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:32,860
The new gardener

710
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:35,068
Gardener?

711
00:53:45,527 --> 00:53:47,360
I'm just fucking with you, chief.

712
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,943
It's Hungarian, it means
that I'll kill you, you little monkey.

713
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:52,152
You know what?

714
00:53:52,152 --> 00:53:53,777
You can go clean that up. Alright!

715
00:53:50,443 --> 00:53:51,485
There is a large pile
shit in the back.

716
00:53:54,652 --> 00:53:56,152
Make sure you do a good job.

717
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,568
Make sure you wipe those boots off!

718
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,360
He's carrying shit in the house.

719
00:54:03,485 --> 00:54:04,943
Did you ever notice that you let go
Mexicans into your home...

720
00:54:04,943 --> 00:54:07,402
just because he's got
gardening tools?

721
00:54:07,402 --> 00:54:08,235
I mean, no questions asked.

722
00:54:08,235 --> 00:54:09,152
You just let him right in.

723
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:14,443
He could have a chainsaw
or a machete...

724
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:20,402
God! Jesus!

725
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,527
Stop it!

726
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:40,235
Dammit, that hurts!

727
00:54:56,068 --> 00:54:58,193
If your father ever saw me, 2 minutes.

728
00:54:58,818 --> 00:55:00,152
Mom, everyone is gonna see you do this.

729
00:55:00,152 --> 00:55:01,193
it's the internet.

730
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:05,027
This is what my viewers wanna see online.

731
00:55:08,735 --> 00:55:11,193
Hey! You not the usual guy.

732
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:13,610
He looks good to me.

733
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,527
Oh don't be shy, come on in!

734
00:55:57,652 --> 00:55:58,652
Access denied.

735
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:15,860
What the fuck did you bring them here for?

736
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,443
Didn't you hear a god damn word I said?

737
00:56:18,277 --> 00:56:18,818
Want me to dump them?

738
00:56:19,193 --> 00:56:20,235
What? No... no.

739
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,902
I would make good use of them.

740
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:25,152
The Church can always use good people.

741
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,402
June?

742
00:56:40,152 --> 00:56:41,235
April?

743
00:57:14,693 --> 00:57:16,527
Where's my wife and daughter?

744
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:18,527
Woah... one family at a time.

745
00:57:18,777 --> 00:57:19,652
It's Osiris...

746
00:57:20,485 --> 00:57:22,693
Machete has a Amano (brother)..

747
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:26,402
or should I say, Padre (Father).

748
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:32,985
State Senator John McLaughlin took a
vow to defend the Constitution of this State.

749
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:34,152
Now!

750
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,360
he's taken a bullet for us.

751
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:44,485
And this is that bullet.

752
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:47,402
Vote to re-elect Sen. John McLaughlin.

753
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:50,402
I'm John McLaughlin
and I approve of this message.

754
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:53,652
Paid for by the Committee to
re-elect of John McLaughlin.

755
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:17,068
Sorry ma'am.

756
00:58:18,568 --> 00:58:19,610
Damn new phone.

757
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,152
Should put on the vibrator.

758
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:23,943
Can you help me do that?

759
00:58:25,527 --> 00:58:26,568
Pervert.

760
00:58:30,485 --> 00:58:31,527
Yeah?

761
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:32,193
Senator?

762
00:58:33,068 --> 00:58:34,110
It's Van.

763
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:38,068
I hear you got a problem maybe we can fix.

764
00:58:38,235 --> 00:58:40,735
Don't call me on this line again.
I'll call you.

765
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:42,818
Now you said it yourself Senator
war has begun.

766
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:45,402
Helter Skelter is here.

767
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,068
Your army awaits further orders.

768
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:49,985
Got to be respectful now.

769
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,110
No shit slaves.

770
00:58:53,568 --> 00:58:54,652
What about the shooter?

771
00:58:54,652 --> 00:58:56,318
He's still out there?

772
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:05,193
There's nothing I'd like more, then to see that Mexican dance the bolero with the end of the rope.

773
00:59:05,568 --> 00:59:08,152
He's gone underground for sure.

774
00:59:07,818 --> 00:59:09,610
Let's say we go underground.

775
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,152
And get him.

776
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:14,027
You find the Network and you
find the shooter.

777
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,110
Call our special friend.

778
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,568
Tell him we're gonna need a helluva more firepower.

779
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:20,402
If he is serious about wanting
that border shut down.

780
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:23,277
Fix your damn gun.

781
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:24,818
Thanks.

782
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,902
Our friend is up.

783
00:59:43,235 --> 00:59:45,027
Where the fuck have you been?

784
00:59:45,943 --> 00:59:48,318
You could at least texted me.

785
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,693
Machete don't text.

786
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:57,027
But Machete get evidence.

787
01:00:03,402 --> 01:00:05,610
Thanks for coming back.

788
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,943
There is no way that McLaughlin
is getting elected, unless something big happens.

789
01:00:11,235 --> 01:00:14,735
Can you imagine if someone shot the senator,
and that someone was a Mexican.

790
01:00:14,735 --> 01:00:16,777
The public would elect him to be president.

791
01:00:17,193 --> 01:00:20,818
It's not a sin if someone clinch
the senator in the leg is it?

792
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:23,068
So, this is footage from your brother's confession?

793
01:00:23,068 --> 01:00:26,485
There's no open commandant against thou shall
not wing a man.

794
01:00:26,485 --> 01:00:27,527
Is there Padre?

795
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,068
But these files over here.

796
01:00:29,068 --> 01:00:30,693
You got from Booth's office.

797
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,235
They're encrypted.

798
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:37,527
Is my little girl April... I spent nights...

799
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:42,027
Denied.

800
01:00:42,818 --> 01:00:44,485
You not going to think it's that easy,
Do you?

801
01:00:46,693 --> 01:00:50,193
I just wish that April
saw me as more a real man.

802
01:01:01,485 --> 01:01:02,485
Holy shit...

803
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,485
You're right. The Network is not behind it.

804
01:01:06,652 --> 01:01:08,318
This is something. A helluva lot bigger.

805
01:01:09,693 --> 01:01:14,152
You've got enough here to bring down everyone.

806
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:13,693
The Senator, Booth...

807
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:17,152
Van...

808
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:19,527
Look here.

809
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:22,902
There's drug money financing the Senator's campaign.

810
01:01:27,027 --> 01:01:29,110
Rogelio Torrez.

811
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:32,443
Torrez...

812
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:36,860
He's the drug kingpin who's been trying to gain
control of the drug trade.

813
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,193
this must be the border fence
McLaughlin wants to build.

814
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,110
See this?

815
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:48,402
These markings show the weakest spots.

816
01:01:49,652 --> 01:01:50,777
It all makes sense now.

817
01:01:51,277 --> 01:01:53,485
Torrez wants to get Senator McLaughlin re-elected,

818
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:56,777
so that he can build a border fence that he
can control.

819
01:01:58,777 --> 01:02:00,902
You did good work Machete.

820
01:02:00,902 --> 01:02:03,402
I bet you're a great cop.

821
01:02:03,777 --> 01:02:04,985
The best.

822
01:02:05,277 --> 01:02:06,360
And modest too.

823
01:02:07,568 --> 01:02:09,068
I'm dry.

824
01:02:16,402 --> 01:02:16,943
Get up.

825
01:02:18,027 --> 01:02:19,068
Why?

826
01:02:20,443 --> 01:02:21,527
Because you're drunk.

827
01:02:27,193 --> 01:02:29,527
Come be with me.

828
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,402
Speak english?

829
01:02:56,193 --> 01:02:58,152
Depends on the question.

830
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,568
We know that you hired that Mexican to kill our senator.

831
01:03:04,235 --> 01:03:05,818
You the Network? Ain't cha?

832
01:03:07,068 --> 01:03:08,777
Hell! You're behind everything.

833
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:10,777
That's not how we work.

834
01:03:12,485 --> 01:03:13,777
But if you want war...

835
01:03:15,193 --> 01:03:16,193
I will give it to you.

836
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,443
How about an eye for an eye?

837
01:03:30,152 --> 01:03:32,152
You burned your last burrito.

838
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,693
You got to get better at this, Billy.

839
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,527
Please, Father, have mercy.

840
01:04:43,235 --> 01:04:46,735
God has mercy, I don't

841
01:05:56,902 --> 01:05:58,318
Hello Padre (Father).

842
01:06:08,443 --> 01:06:11,318
The Blood of Christ?
Taste like Merlot to me.

843
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:15,818
Where is he?

844
01:06:16,193 --> 01:06:18,110
He's everywhere.

845
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:21,235
Talk Padre.

846
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:25,902
Sing me one of those Mexican hymns
like a chroming arch boy.

847
01:06:26,152 --> 01:06:27,652
Go to hell.

848
01:06:40,985 --> 01:06:44,235
You want to be a martyr?
I'm good at making martyrs.

849
01:06:45,527 --> 01:06:46,818
Like Senator McLaughlin?

850
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,818
That's right.

851
01:06:48,652 --> 01:06:51,527
We have to get that Senator re-elected.
Get that fence built along the border.

852
01:06:51,527 --> 01:06:53,443
before it is too late.

853
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,902
You really hate our kind that much?

854
01:06:56,277 --> 01:07:00,277
No padre, I hate declining profits that much.

855
01:07:01,068 --> 01:07:03,818
An open border allows supply of flowing too easily.

856
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:06,027
Drives our prices down.

857
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:10,902
Restricted border limits supply.
Drives the prices up.

858
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,152
Higher price, higher profits.

859
01:07:14,193 --> 01:07:18,152
You are drunk with power,
even putting the hit on your own boss.

860
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,902
Just to boost his election numbers.

861
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:27,110
Last chance, amigo.

862
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:31,360
Where's Machete and
where are my wife and daughter?

863
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,318
In hell.

864
01:07:40,777 --> 01:07:42,318
Then give them my best.

865
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,193
A real gentleman.

866
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:29,110
Comfortable...

867
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,610
Are they the same?

868
01:09:39,402 --> 01:09:41,693
They want you dead too.

869
01:09:42,652 --> 01:09:44,152
My brother.

870
01:09:45,068 --> 01:09:46,318
Wait!

871
01:10:18,735 --> 01:10:20,360
How do you text with this thing?

872
01:10:26,318 --> 01:10:27,443
I thought Machete don't text.

873
01:10:31,943 --> 01:10:33,360
Machete improvise.

874
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,693
Where're you going?

875
01:10:42,443 --> 01:10:43,943
Take out the trash.

876
01:11:05,818 --> 01:11:07,360
Machete, sent me a text.

877
01:11:07,818 --> 01:11:09,443
What's it say?

878
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:14,818
You just fuck with the wrong Mexican.

879
01:11:16,277 --> 01:11:17,735
He's coming after us.

880
01:11:17,985 --> 01:11:21,027
No, he's coming after you.

881
01:11:24,068 --> 01:11:25,610
You got some news?

882
01:11:25,652 --> 01:11:26,693
Yes.

883
01:11:28,152 --> 01:11:29,485
His brother's is dead.

884
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:30,943
You killed a priest.

885
01:11:30,943 --> 01:11:31,985
Congratulations.

886
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,485
That's right Booth, I'm in your town.

887
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:39,735
And I'm gonna kill Machete.

888
01:11:40,277 --> 01:11:41,610
And you're gonna watch it happen.

889
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:44,610
And it will be the last you see.

890
01:11:44,652 --> 01:11:45,693
Wait a second.

891
01:11:46,318 --> 01:11:48,235
There's a girl from ICE.

892
01:11:48,318 --> 01:11:50,860
She's with Machete and they have a file on me,

893
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,318
on you, on McLaughlin, on everybody.

894
01:11:53,318 --> 01:11:57,235
She can make things
very difficult for us.

895
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,318
Where is she?

896
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,568
You know, I've been thinking.

897
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,152
We let these people into our homes,

898
01:12:05,152 --> 01:12:07,152
Watch our kids,

899
01:12:07,277 --> 01:12:09,735
park our cars.

900
01:12:10,318 --> 01:12:12,110
But we won't let them, into our country.

901
01:12:13,193 --> 01:12:15,027
Does that make any sense to you?

902
01:12:14,943 --> 01:12:17,818
Hey! That wetback whack the both of us over the head.

903
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:19,943
In case you forgot, he shot me in the leg.

904
01:12:20,193 --> 01:12:22,527
I thought Jango shot you?

905
01:12:22,652 --> 01:12:24,318
I don't want to hear that story again.

906
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:25,360
Think about it.

907
01:12:25,527 --> 01:12:27,277
He wasn't here for us.

908
01:12:27,652 --> 01:12:28,777
He's here for the boss.

909
01:12:28,902 --> 01:12:32,943
I've been watching the boss. This guy
is a real scumbag.

910
01:12:32,985 --> 01:12:34,068
Hey, hey, hey.

911
01:12:34,443 --> 01:12:36,402
Where's your loyalty at?

912
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:46,902
Did you hear that?

913
01:12:49,068 --> 01:12:50,485
It's weed whacker.

914
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,110
He's back!
Spread out.

915
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:53,610
Spread out NOW!

916
01:13:13,193 --> 01:13:13,860
Alpha unit, you copy?

917
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:20,693
Quit!

918
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:28,027
Anybody report.
You hear me?

919
01:13:28,568 --> 01:13:29,943
Anybody?

920
01:13:38,568 --> 01:13:40,360
Where's Booth?

921
01:13:39,443 --> 01:13:40,943
The senator, his with the senator.

922
01:13:41,735 --> 01:13:42,860
I have a GPS.

923
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:45,068
Tracks his limo.

924
01:13:45,568 --> 01:13:48,235
Hey! Don't kill me, please, take it.

925
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:59,360
That's Spanish, "I let you live. "

926
01:13:59,943 --> 01:14:02,527
Thanks Chief

927
01:14:05,027 --> 01:14:06,693
Let me see if I am hearing you right.

928
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:08,777
One of the city's most prominent businessmen.

929
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:09,818
A Texas vigilante.

930
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:14,610
The most notorious drug kingpin of Mexico
and a state senator,

931
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:17,818
are all conspiring to enact stricter immigration laws?

932
01:14:18,027 --> 01:14:21,693
I know how it sounds, but I have Booth
on video committing a murder.

933
01:14:21,693 --> 01:14:22,818
I have tons of confessions.

934
01:14:22,818 --> 01:14:23,693
I mean it's...

935
01:14:24,152 --> 01:14:30,068
Listen to yourself, this man is an illegal alien,
ILLEGAL as in against the law.

936
01:14:30,777 --> 01:14:34,068
Well, there's the law and there's what's right.

937
01:14:38,485 --> 01:14:39,818
I'm gonna do what's right.

938
01:14:57,818 --> 01:15:00,818
<i> We are live from the Church of Hope
where just moments ago. </i>

939
01:15:00,652 --> 01:15:02,777
<i> Police discovered a gruesome murder. </i>

940
01:15:02,777 --> 01:15:05,277
<i> The body of a priest
was found nailed to the cross. </i>

941
01:15:05,277 --> 01:15:08,193
<i> And witnesses descriptions of
a man leaving the church. </i>

942
01:15:08,277 --> 01:15:11,360
<i> Match those of a gunman wanted for the
shooting of Senator McLaughlin. </i>

943
01:15:11,485 --> 01:15:14,235
Excuse me, honey's just shut the door
and give us a moment.

944
01:15:14,568 --> 01:15:16,402
<i> On the street, they call him Machete. </i>

945
01:15:16,402 --> 01:15:18,693
<i> Who is he, what is he? </i>

946
01:15:18,693 --> 01:15:20,610
<i> And will he ever be brought down? </i>

947
01:15:21,152 --> 01:15:21,777
Where the fuck have you been?

948
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:24,152
This story is burning the whole fucking town to the ground.

949
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:25,860
It's giving us a war that I
know we can win!

950
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:27,943
He's a cockroach, sooner or later he'll
be squashed.

951
01:15:27,943 --> 01:15:28,277
Oh, oh, yeah!

952
01:15:28,235 --> 01:15:30,318
Well, this roach has got AK-47's

953
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,693
and he's laying waste to everything
that get's in his fucking path.

954
01:15:32,568 --> 01:15:34,402
I'm taking care of it.

955
01:15:34,485 --> 01:15:36,360
They scheduled me for release in
a couple of minutes...

956
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,443
I can't walk outta here like a fucking piñata
waiting to get whacked.

957
01:15:39,443 --> 01:15:41,235
The man they are calling Machete...
- We're ready for you Senator.

958
01:15:43,443 --> 01:15:46,485
It's show time...

959
01:15:49,193 --> 01:15:50,193
You forgot your cane, sir.

960
01:15:55,402 --> 01:15:56,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

961
01:15:56,693 --> 01:16:00,360
Senator John McLaughlin.

962
01:16:06,693 --> 01:16:07,860
Thank you, thank you.

963
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:13,443
This freehold danzito is not any closer to justice.

964
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:17,443
I "urge" this criminal and
those that are hiding him,

965
01:16:16,985 --> 01:16:18,027
to turn him in.

966
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:20,527
He's destroying us from the inside,

967
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:22,360
like the plague that he is...

968
01:16:23,735 --> 01:16:27,235
We must not let
terrorist win.

969
01:16:27,235 --> 01:16:28,193
Senator?

970
01:16:28,193 --> 01:16:29,568
There are reports implicating,

971
01:16:29,568 --> 01:16:33,235
your advisors as having orchestrating
the assassination attempt.

972
01:16:33,693 --> 01:16:36,485
Would you care to comment?

973
01:16:38,152 --> 01:16:39,735
What now?

974
01:16:42,777 --> 01:16:45,402
<i>Want to be a martyr?
I am good at making martyrs. </i>

975
01:16:45,818 --> 01:16:47,485
<i> Like Senator McLaughlin? </i>

976
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,443
<i> That's right. </i>

977
01:16:48,443 --> 01:16:51,693
<i> We have to get that Senator re-elected.
Get that fence built along the border. </i>

978
01:16:51,693 --> 01:16:52,735
<i> Before it's too late. </i>

979
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:54,777
Or do you care to comment,

980
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,318
on the shooting. That happened

981
01:16:56,318 --> 01:16:58,943
on the border
on the night of July 22nd?

982
01:17:00,277 --> 01:17:01,527
<i> Who is gonna stop us? </i>

983
01:17:01,527 --> 01:17:02,568
<i> I am! </i>

984
01:17:04,402 --> 01:17:05,652
<i> Welcome to the America. </i>

985
01:17:08,443 --> 01:17:09,735
<i> You catch all that? </i>

986
01:17:09,735 --> 01:17:12,943
<i> Burn me a DVD. Behind our supporters
are going to like that! </i>

987
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:13,985
<i> A lot! </i>

988
01:17:16,693 --> 01:17:19,902
How about your connections with drug king pin
Rogelio Torrez?

989
01:17:20,152 --> 01:17:20,777
No further comment.

990
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:21,902
I'm sorry, I just...

991
01:17:21,902 --> 01:17:24,402
Or the border vigilantes involved in running drugs?

992
01:17:27,027 --> 01:17:28,235
I think I'm having a heart attack.

993
01:17:28,402 --> 01:17:30,943
God dammit if you don't relax
you will have one.

994
01:17:41,485 --> 01:17:43,402
You jeopardize more than my career,

995
01:17:43,402 --> 01:17:44,485
We got cut back.

996
01:17:45,235 --> 01:17:46,318
He could have killed me.

997
01:17:46,068 --> 01:17:47,485
Not with that scope.

998
01:17:49,235 --> 01:17:51,235
You stupid son of a bitch...

999
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:53,277
You pulled something like that
without consulting me?

1000
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,943
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

1001
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:58,402
I'm the one who got your campaign financed.

1002
01:17:58,152 --> 01:18:00,235
Made you a political powerhouse.

1003
01:17:59,943 --> 01:18:01,527
Your own personal Jesus.

1004
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,610
So, you better get down on your knees,

1005
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:04,027
and start praying for me to save your soul

1006
01:18:04,027 --> 01:18:06,527
Because I'm the only one who can at
this point!

1007
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:21,027
Get the fuck out.

1008
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:54,360
God dammit man,
why don't you just die?

1009
01:18:55,818 --> 01:18:56,818
It's gonna work.

1010
01:18:57,277 --> 01:18:58,277
We could have been rich.

1011
01:18:58,068 --> 01:19:00,110
Torrez.

1012
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,068
Was stopping all those cheap shit from across the border.

1013
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:03,110
Did I tell you that?

1014
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,902
Can lead more than a tired pendejo (fool) with
a dime bag and a dream.

1015
01:19:06,818 --> 01:19:08,235
So we financed Van.

1016
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,193
Giving them men guns.

1017
01:19:09,193 --> 01:19:10,193
The Vigilantes.

1018
01:19:11,318 --> 01:19:13,027
Our own little private border patrol.

1019
01:19:13,818 --> 01:19:16,610
But Torrez wanted all that chelada.

1020
01:19:16,402 --> 01:19:19,235
So I thought why not let politics
do what guns couldn't.

1021
01:19:19,985 --> 01:19:24,610
Funny things is that I thought
it would be a peaceful solution.

1022
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,527
None of that tortured taco.

1023
01:19:29,068 --> 01:19:29,902
Wait, wait...

1024
01:19:30,485 --> 01:19:31,527
Torrez is looking for you.

1025
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:33,527
You find Van, you'll find Torrez.

1026
01:19:35,235 --> 01:19:36,527
Please...

1027
01:19:37,777 --> 01:19:38,235
Tell me...

1028
01:19:38,735 --> 01:19:40,235
where are my wife and daughter?

1029
01:19:42,485 --> 01:19:43,527
With God.

1030
01:19:44,902 --> 01:19:47,068
I guess I won't be seeing them.

1031
01:20:01,485 --> 01:20:03,152
Fuck! My head...

1032
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:07,860
What is this shit?

1033
01:20:08,277 --> 01:20:09,985
That asshole drugged us.

1034
01:20:10,818 --> 01:20:11,860
Where are our clothes?

1035
01:20:12,652 --> 01:20:14,693
Call daddy.

1036
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:29,110
It's June,

1037
01:20:30,527 --> 01:20:31,568
and April.

1038
01:20:32,818 --> 01:20:34,943
We're very sorry.

1039
01:20:35,318 --> 01:20:36,610
Your husband is dead.

1040
01:20:38,068 --> 01:20:39,152
He's what?

1041
01:20:38,902 --> 01:20:40,568
Senator McLaughlin shot him.

1042
01:20:59,152 --> 01:21:02,277
Secure that weapon!
Yeah!

1043
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:05,277
<i> Vigilante leader, Van Jackson has
refused declined comment, </i>

1044
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,735
<i> after startling revelations of their connections,  </i>

1045
01:21:07,735 --> 01:21:08,818

1046
01:21:10,027 --> 01:21:11,027
This is Van...

1047
01:21:10,568 --> 01:21:11,568
I'm coming in.

1048
01:21:11,568 --> 01:21:13,735
We're all over the news senator...

1049
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:16,235
You compromised everything we worked for.

1050
01:21:16,818 --> 01:21:18,193
There is only one way this is gonna end.

1051
01:21:18,193 --> 01:21:19,235
smoke em' out.

1052
01:21:19,818 --> 01:21:21,735
But I wanna put a bullet in his head myself.

1053
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:24,110
And just how you're figuring on doing that?

1054
01:21:24,277 --> 01:21:27,777
I'm joining you boys for one last ride along.

1055
01:21:44,318 --> 01:21:45,360
Machete.

1056
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,068
Where's Luz?

1057
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,943
She's gone, man.

1058
01:21:51,485 --> 01:21:53,485
Vigilante's got her.

1059
01:21:53,485 --> 01:21:55,110
And now they're after you.

1060
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:56,568
You gotta lead us to fight,

1061
01:21:56,568 --> 01:21:57,943
it's what Luz would have want!

1062
01:21:57,777 --> 01:21:59,402
Not your war.

1063
01:21:59,985 --> 01:22:01,568
I maybe adopted as'say.

1064
01:22:01,985 --> 01:22:02,818
No shit.

1065
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,152
What's going on, not right!

1066
01:22:05,568 --> 01:22:07,360
We just wanna help, bro.

1067
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,693
I don't need your help.

1068
01:22:11,152 --> 01:22:12,152
Not us?

1069
01:22:13,652 --> 01:22:14,777
Then who?

1070
01:22:25,527 --> 01:22:26,527
Whatever you need.

1071
01:22:25,985 --> 01:22:28,443
Build it, strip it, chop it.

1072
01:22:29,485 --> 01:22:30,777
Garage's is yours, Homez...

1073
01:22:31,027 --> 01:22:32,277
Got guns?

1074
01:22:32,193 --> 01:22:33,318
Si (yes).

1075
01:22:33,277 --> 01:22:35,860
We missiles, machine guns.

1076
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:38,193
We fight Van, we fight Torrez.

1077
01:22:38,193 --> 01:22:40,235
We take em' all down at once.

1078
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,860
Hey everyone!

1079
01:22:42,318 --> 01:22:42,735
Listen UP!

1080
01:22:42,735 --> 01:22:43,777
Now we got some work to do!

1081
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:53,610
Does anyone knows who's Machete?

1082
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,402
Does anyone knows who's Machete?

1083
01:22:57,402 --> 01:22:58,443
Please.

1084
01:22:58,985 --> 01:23:00,402
Machete needs your help

1085
01:23:00,402 --> 01:23:02,110
or he'll be killed just like Luz,

1086
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,152
just like Padre (Father).

1087
01:23:07,735 --> 01:23:08,902
Listen to me!

1088
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:12,527
Yes, I am a woman of the law,

1089
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:15,027
and there are lots of laws!

1090
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:17,360
But if they don't offer us justice,

1091
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,318
Then they aren't law!

1092
01:23:20,235 --> 01:23:21,985
They are just lines drawn in the sand

1093
01:23:21,985 --> 01:23:24,402
by men who would stand on your backs.

1094
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:26,193
For power and glory.

1095
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:29,568
Men who deserves to be cut down.

1096
01:23:31,193 --> 01:23:33,277
It's time to erase the meyette the line!

1097
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,568
And show these cabronese the
true meaning of true law!

1098
01:23:38,318 --> 01:23:39,735
We didn't cross the border.

1099
01:23:39,735 --> 01:23:42,943
The border crossed us!

1100
01:23:43,777 --> 01:23:45,110
Viva la (long live) Machete!

1101
01:23:46,235 --> 01:23:47,818
Viva la (long live) Machete!

1102
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:50,193
You’re Machete's girl.

1103
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:51,402
I know,

1104
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,318
Unless you're his type.

1105
01:23:53,652 --> 01:23:54,693
What type is that?

1106
01:23:55,902 --> 01:23:57,777
Dead.

1107
01:24:10,402 --> 01:24:13,277

she's been captured by Torrez!

1122

All hands and the armory to load up.

1123
01:24:45,693 --> 01:24:47,318
Time to roll out!

1124
01:25:53,652 --> 01:25:55,027
Give me a vest and a rifle.

1125
01:25:59,527 --> 01:26:01,152
My great grand daddy...

1126
01:26:01,193 --> 01:26:04,027
did not give his life at at The Alamo
so that we could

1127
01:26:04,027 --> 01:26:07,818
sell off our nation to some
backstabbing politicians.

1128
01:26:08,193 --> 01:26:09,110
What are you talking about?

1129
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:10,818
You lied to us,

1130
01:26:10,818 --> 01:26:12,943
you paid that Mexican to put on an act.

1131
01:26:12,943 --> 01:26:13,985
To fool the people.

1132
01:26:14,652 --> 01:26:16,318
And my pool of posse.

1133
01:26:16,568 --> 01:26:17,485
Now he's on his way...

1134
01:26:17,485 --> 01:26:20,027
And no doubt bringing a whole
mess of bean eaters.

1135
01:26:20,652 --> 01:26:23,402
You seem to be quite fond of Booth, Senator.

1136
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:25,235
You've been in the desert too long amigo...

1137
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,360
Well let's see just how this blows your skirt up?

1138
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:31,777
We're gonna simulcast your execution
for the crime of treason.

1139
01:26:35,652 --> 01:26:37,443
No shit stains.

1140
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:42,277
Guys! They're on their way!

1141
01:26:43,068 --> 01:26:44,068
Get to your posts!

1142
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,568
Time for your last testament.

1143
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:02,235
No second takes.

1144
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:03,902
Just get your lines right.

1145
01:27:32,235 --> 01:27:33,693
Hold the line...

1146
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:42,652
I have desecrated the oath of our first...

1147
01:27:43,318 --> 01:27:47,235
and I am a traitor deserving death.

1148
01:27:47,277 --> 01:27:48,235
Ready?

1149
01:27:50,277 --> 01:27:51,610
Fucking parasites!

1150
01:27:52,110 --> 01:27:53,527
Fucking terrorists!

1151
01:27:54,693 --> 01:27:56,485
Aim.

1152
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:15,152
Shit

1153
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:15,943
Two of you stay with him...

1154
01:28:15,943 --> 01:28:16,985
The rest of you outside.

1155
01:28:26,193 --> 01:28:28,110
Oh shit!

1156
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,360
Fuck em up!

1157
01:30:16,402 --> 01:30:17,402
How is your eye?

1158
01:30:17,402 --> 01:30:18,402
What eye?

1159
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,610
If you want to survive your own war,

1160
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:07,027
you better become Mexican real fast.

1161
01:31:10,443 --> 01:31:12,985
You got enemies on all sides, Senator.

1162
01:31:15,027 --> 01:31:17,360
Who can you trust?

1163
01:31:17,318 --> 01:31:19,360
You aim to take down those boys?

1164
01:31:21,652 --> 01:31:22,777
Then I'm with you.

1165
01:31:56,568 --> 01:31:59,110
Take out that Mexican!

1166
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:01,360
God Dammit!

1167
01:32:11,402 --> 01:32:13,818
Van, we're fucked! We
gotta get outta here.

1168
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:14,860
Get outta here!

1169
01:32:33,527 --> 01:32:34,568
Sister...

1170
01:32:35,318 --> 01:32:36,443
Please...

1171
01:32:37,902 --> 01:32:38,943
I've done wrong...

1172
01:32:39,568 --> 01:32:40,610
I've done terrible this life...

1173
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:43,068
And I'm not even from here
I hate Texas.

1174
01:32:43,068 --> 01:32:44,110
I hate the heat.

1175
01:32:44,902 --> 01:32:46,527
Give me my last rites.

1176
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:51,902
In the name of my father.

1177
01:32:52,485 --> 01:32:53,568
My father...

1178
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:56,318
April.

1179
01:33:03,402 --> 01:33:04,402
Forgot the rest.

1180
01:34:04,735 --> 01:34:06,818
You never learn to stay down!
Punieta (jerk off).

1181
01:34:07,485 --> 01:34:09,277
So I guess I have to teach you.

1182
01:34:13,693 --> 01:34:15,277
Got something to say?

1183
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,777
Now you got something to say?

1184
01:34:31,443 --> 01:34:33,652
Back the fuck up and watch.

1185
01:34:37,152 --> 01:34:38,235
Okay Punieta!

1186
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:40,318
Adelante (Forward).

1187
01:34:55,568 --> 01:34:57,652
We used to be federale's together
kanna (root),

1188
01:34:57,652 --> 01:34:58,693
Remember?

1189
01:35:03,902 --> 01:35:04,818
We were brothers...

1190
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:06,652
But you?

1191
01:35:06,652 --> 01:35:08,818
went for the honor.

1192
01:35:08,818 --> 01:35:10,485
Pendejo (coward).

1193
01:35:19,777 --> 01:35:21,277
Then I went for the power.

1194
01:35:23,277 --> 01:35:25,443
We killed a lot
of bad guys together.

1195
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:29,318
Now I'm the bad guy.

1196
01:35:30,693 --> 01:35:32,318
What do you wanna do?
hermanito (little brother)?

1197
01:35:44,068 --> 01:35:46,360
Look at your Machete now. Cabrón

1198
01:35:50,818 --> 01:35:52,027
He's gonna kill him.

1199
01:35:53,777 --> 01:35:55,277
No he's not.

1200
01:35:57,110 --> 01:35:58,277
He's Machete.

1201
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:04,318
No point.

1202
01:36:13,735 --> 01:36:14,902
Cap Puto (fuck).

1203
01:36:17,068 --> 01:36:20,277
You know I could kill you now
very easily.

1204
01:36:21,318 --> 01:36:22,235
Believe me.

1205
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,652
This is nothing.

1206
01:36:27,027 --> 01:36:28,652
This ain't shit.

1207
01:36:29,152 --> 01:36:30,152
But...

1208
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:36,068
I know you'll just be waiting for me in hell.

1209
01:36:36,152 --> 01:36:39,068
So...

1210
01:36:41,068 --> 01:36:42,277
I think I'll say goodbye.

1211
01:36:45,985 --> 01:36:47,235
Fuck it.

1212
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:19,652
There's one!

1213
01:38:21,027 --> 01:38:22,568
God damn cockroach

1214
01:38:35,068 --> 01:38:36,735
Can't speak english. Can you boy?

1215
01:38:41,068 --> 01:38:42,402
Welcome to America.

1216
01:39:32,277 --> 01:39:33,818
What? You wanna see my ID?

1217
01:39:33,818 --> 01:39:34,860
Don't bother.

1218
01:39:36,277 --> 01:39:37,610
I've got something better.

1219
01:39:40,443 --> 01:39:41,568
I called in a few favours.

1220
01:39:41,568 --> 01:39:42,610
Look at this.

1221
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:44,777
Got you all the right papers.

1222
01:39:45,818 --> 01:39:47,235
You can start over now.

1223
01:39:48,027 --> 01:39:49,402
Be a real person.

1224
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,527
Why do I want to be a real person?

1225
01:39:53,027 --> 01:39:54,818
I'm already a myth.

1226
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,027
Where will you go?

1227
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:01,110
Everywhere.

1228
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:07,485
Can I ride with you?

1229
01:40:08,305 --> 01:40:14,530
