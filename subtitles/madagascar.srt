1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

3
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,909
Surprise!

4
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,995
Alex. Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming.

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,355
When a zebra's in the zone,
leave him alone.

6
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,193
Come on. Just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

7
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,316
Hey, man, thanks.

8
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,077
Hey, I got something
stuck in my teeth.

9
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,833
It's driving me crazy.
Can you help me? Please?

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,115
You came to the right place,
my friend.

11
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,078
Dr Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.

12
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,995
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,120
- I don't see anything.
- It's on the left.

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,315
Oh, sorry.

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,868
OK, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

16
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,316
Right here. What the heck
is this doing in there?

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,753
Happy birthday!

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,115
Aw, hey, thanks, man.

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,192
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,192
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out.

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,034
- Look at that. Ooh! Look at that.
- Look at that. It's snowing.

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,189
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,430
Double digits. The big 1 -0.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,109
You don't like it?

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,316
- No, no, it's great.
- You hate it.

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,029
I should've gotten you the Alex
alarm clock. That's the big seller.

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,918
No, no, no.
The present's great, really.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,434
It's just that
another year's come and gone

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,590
and I'm still doing
the same old thing.

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,310
"Stand over here. Trot over there.
Eat some grass. Walk back over here."

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,039
- I see your problem.
- I should go to law school.

32
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,759
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,558
- How?
- Throw out the old act.

34
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,791
Who knows what you'll do.
Make it up as you go along.

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,440
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,670
- Really?
- You know, make it fresh.

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,035
Fresh, huh? OK.
I could do fresh.

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,155
Works for me.

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,308
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

40
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,833
It's fun people fun time!

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,515
Let's go, Gloria!
Up and at 'em. We're open!

42
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,515
What day is it?

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,830
It's Friday. Field trip day.

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,071
Yes, it's field trip day.
Let's get up and go...

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,798
...in ten more minutes.

46
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,629
Come on!

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,473
Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,678
Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another
fabulous morning in the Big Apple.

49
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,034
Let's go.

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,953
- Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
- What?

51
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,828
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here. See?

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,876
Right there. You see?

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,952
Melman, you know
it's all in your head. Hm?

54
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,758
Let's go! Come on!

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,990
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,317
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,029
Straight out the ground.
Tasty fresh! Freshalicious.

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,235
Ziploc fresh.

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

60
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,155
the Central Park Zoo
proudly presents:

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,958
Show them the cat. Who's the cat?

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,270
The king of New York City.

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,749
Alex the lion.

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,914
It's showtime.

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,271
Roar!

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,475
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,109
Check out the zebra
taking care of biz. That's right.

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,676
Just smile and wave, boys.

69
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,512
Smile and wave.

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,716
Kowalski, progress report.

71
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,310
We're 500 feet from the main sewer line.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,278
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

73
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,634
Right.

74
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,078
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

75
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,438
And find more Popsicle sticks.
We don't want to risk another cave-in.

76
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,714
And me, skipper?

77
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,712
I want you to look
cute and cuddly, private.

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,109
Today we're going to blow this dump.

79
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,714
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

80
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,353
Yeah! You don't
see that on Animal Planet.

81
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,029
Ha-ha.

82
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,908
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,230
I hope you thought it was fresh.

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,753
I'll be here all week.

85
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,274
In fact, I'll be here
for my whole life.

86
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,635
Three hundred
and sixty-five days a year,

87
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,514
including Christmas,
Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa.

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,956
Please don't forget
to never spay or neuter your pets.

89
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,791
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

90
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,271
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

91
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,873
I sprechen.

92
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,952
- What continent is this?
- Manhattan.

93
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,838
Hoover Dam!
We're still in New York.

94
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,036
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,270
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,671
What are you guys doing?

97
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,557
We're digging to Antarctica.

98
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,628
Ant-who-tica?

99
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,198
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

100
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,193
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

101
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,195
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

102
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,397
This is all some kind
of whacked-out conspiracy.

103
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,359
We're going to the
wide-open spaces of Antarctica.

104
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,759
To the wild.

105
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,029
The wild?
You could actually go there?

106
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,348
That sounds great.

107
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,954
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

108
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,393
You didn't see anything.

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,469
Right?

110
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,152
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,832
I'm sorry. No, sir.

112
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,199
For his final appearance of the day,

113
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,352
the king of New York City.

114
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,873
Alex the lion.

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,672
Roar!

116
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,151
Thank you. Thank you very much.

117
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,710
You guys are great. You're a
great crowd. Give yourselves a hand.

118
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,995
Thank you. Oh. Thank you.

119
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,752
Oh! Well. Thank you.

120
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,077
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

121
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,715
Underpants!

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,792
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

123
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,354
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

124
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,237
This is the life.

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,352
That's the spot.

126
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,192
Oh! I'm in heaven.

127
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,240
- Ooh, it's Marty's birthday.
- Just rip it open.

128
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,357
- What is it?
- Come on. Open it up. What you got?

129
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,668
A thermometer.

130
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,469
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.

131
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,791
I wanted to give you something personal.
That was my first rectal thermometer.

132
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,552
- I'll miss that bad boy.
- Get the cake. Melman, come on.

133
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,832
Happy birthday to you

134
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,831
You live in a zoo

135
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,150
You look like a monkey

136
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,834
And you smell like one too

137
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,959
I say.

138
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,358
Aw, well, now, you guys
are just embarrassing me.

139
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,668
And yourselves.

140
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,115
What? We worked
on that all week.

141
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
Let's go.
Let's make a wish, babycakes.

142
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,033
- What'd you wish for?
- Nope. Can't tell you that.

143
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,269
Come on. Tell.

144
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,555
No siree.
I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

145
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,870
You want some bad luck,
I'll blab it out.

146
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,633
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

147
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,154
Would you just tell us?
What could happen?

148
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,514
OK.

149
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,718
I wished I could go to the wild!

150
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,915
The wild?!

151
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,073
I told you it was bad luck.

152
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,598
The wild? Are you nuts?

153
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,672
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

154
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,399
It's unsanitary.

155
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,438
The penguins are going.
So why can't l?

156
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,078
The penguins are psychotic.

157
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,311
Come on. Just imagine
going back to nature.

158
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,234
Back to your roots.
Clean air, wide-open spaces!

159
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,629
There's wide-open spaces
in Connecticut.

160
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,917
- Connecticut?
- You got to go over to Grand Central.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,117
Then you got to take
the Metro-North train... north?

162
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,273
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

163
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,033
Come on. What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

164
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,997
- Lyme disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

165
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,229
No, I just want...

166
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,151
There's none of this in the wild.

167
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,471
This is a highly
refined type of food thing

168
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,278
that you do not find in the wild.

169
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,477
Ever thought there might
be more to life than steak, Alex?

170
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,279
He didn't mean that, baby.
No, no, no.

171
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,069
Doesn't it bother you guys
that you don't know anything

172
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,276
about life outside this zoo?

173
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,194
- Nuh-uh. Nope.
- Mm-mm.

174
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,795
Well, I mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

175
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,437
You got a little schmutz
right there on your....

176
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,072
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for the party. It was great.

177
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,354
Really.

178
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,955
What's eating him?

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,794
Maybe you should talk to him.
Go over and give him a little pep talk.

180
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,555
Hey, I already gave him
a snow globe. I can't top that.

181
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,629
I can see where this is going.

182
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,199
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

183
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,271
Come on. He's your best friend.

184
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,238
All right, all right. OK.

185
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,754
- Night, Marty.
- Night, Glo.

186
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,432
What a day.

187
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,957
I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't
get any better than this, you know?

188
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,237
Ooh! It just did. Even the star's out.

189
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,033
Not going to find a star
like that in the wild.

190
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,109
Helicopter.

191
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,393
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

192
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,632
Everybody has days when they think the
grass might be greener somewhere else.

193
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,709
Alex.

194
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,948
Look at me.

195
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,873
I'm ten years old.
My life is half over.

196
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,589
And I don't even know
if I'm black with white stripes...

197
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,671
...or white with black stripes.

198
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,229
Marty.

199
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,559
I'm thinking of a song.

200
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,392
Alex. Please. Not now.

201
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,155
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

202
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,228
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
No, no, no.

203
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,753
I'm not listening.

204
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,232
Start spreadin' the news

205
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,355
I don't know you.

206
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,034
I'm leaving today

207
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,636
- We are a great big part of it
- He's funny. Who is that?

208
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,034
Come on. You know
you know the words.

209
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,111
Two little words.

210
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,349
New York.

211
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,953
New York

212
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,032
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

213
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,872
We're not all nocturnal!

214
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,394
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.

215
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,596
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

216
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,433
You mess with him,
you mess with me, Howard.

217
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,990
- You're a bigmouth lion.
- See? Mr Grumpy Stripes.

218
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,275
We make a great team,
the two of us.

219
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,920
We sure do. No doubt about it.

220
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,470
So, what are you going to do? Go
running off to the wild by yourself?

221
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,549
- No.
- Good.

222
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,119
You and me. Let's go.

223
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,235
- What?
- The wild.

224
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,515
Come on. You and me together.

225
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,797
It's a straight shot
down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.

226
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,836
We'll grab a train, we'll head north.

227
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,514
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

228
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,670
You're joking. Right?

229
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,871
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course
I'm joking. Give me a break.

230
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,598
Like we're going to get a train.

231
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,754
Don't do that. You really
had me worried there.

232
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,628
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.

233
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,110
Yeah, me too. I'll need
to rest my voice for tomorrow.

234
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,672
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

235
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,513
Give them a little jolt. You know?

236
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,551
Good night, AllyAl.

237
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,673
They forgot to turn off
the ambience again.

238
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,716
Don't worry. It's cool.

239
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,037
You know, I got it.

240
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,519
Much better.

241
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,835
Come on, now, baby.

242
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,911
My little filet.

243
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,072
My little filet mignon
with a little fat around the edges.

244
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,869
I like that. I like
a little fat on my steak.

245
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,078
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

246
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,754
Alex. Alex. Alex!

247
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,114
What? What?

248
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,269
You suck your thumb?

249
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,149
What is it, Melman?

250
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,913
You know how I have
that bladder infection

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,831
and I have to get up
every two hours?

252
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,072
I got up to pee and looked over at
Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.

253
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,037
I don't know why, but I did. And...

254
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,553
What? What's going on?

255
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,358
It's Marty. He's gone.

256
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,954
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

257
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,508
How long has he been working on this?

258
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,828
Marty!

259
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,194
Marty!

260
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,918
He wouldn't fit down there.

261
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,672
Marty? Marty! Marty!

262
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,228
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

263
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,628
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

264
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,553
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

265
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,029
I mean, we got to call somebody!

266
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,469
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

267
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,155
We've got a lost zebra on
the way to Connecticut, and we need...

268
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,115
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second.

269
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,555
- We can't call the people.
- What the...?

270
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,628
They'll be really mad.

271
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,235
It'll get Marty transferred.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

272
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,673
I know that's right.

273
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,354
We got to go after him.
He's not thinking straight.

274
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,113
Stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

275
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,115
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

276
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,674
Poor little guy.

277
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,829
Come on.

278
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,309
One of us should wait
in case he comes back.

279
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,358
Not now. This is an intervention.
We all got to go.

280
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,635
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

281
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,756
- You should take Lexington.
- Melman!

282
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,991
- OK. "We." We should take Lexington.
- What about Park?

283
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,674
No, Park goes two ways.
You can't time the lights.

284
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,475
I heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Centre.

285
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,157
Well, of course we're
going to throw poo at him.

286
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,839
We should've taken Park.

287
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,832
Sure this is the fastest way
to Grand Central Station?

288
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,956
I don't know!
That's what Melman said.

289
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,519
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

290
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,149
That room has some nifty little
sinks you can wash up in, and look!

291
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,878
Free mints!

292
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,234
This isn't a field trip.

293
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,835
This is an urgent mission to save
Marty from throwing his life away.

294
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,239
Now, where's the train?

295
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,909
Here it comes.

296
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,557
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him.

297
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,076
I did! I did! I don't understand.
He said, "Let's go."

298
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,038
I said, "Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old."

299
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,749
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

300
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,151
What you got to do is go
straight back down West 42nd.

301
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,356
It's on your left after Vanderbilt.

302
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,512
If you hit the Chrysler Building,
you've gone too far.

303
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,113
Thanks a lot, officer.

304
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,149
Hey! Wait for the light.

305
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,149
Freak.

306
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,834
- Did you say "zebra"?
- That's right. A zebra.

307
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,239
Right in front of me.

308
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,833
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

309
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,390
Then I'm going to need some backup.

310
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,677
- Aw! Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

311
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,991
Did that say "Grand Central Station"
or "my aunt's constipation"?

312
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,069
This is it.

313
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,389
Grand Central Station.

314
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,756
It's grand and it's central.

315
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,434
Move aside. We have an emergency here.
This is an emergency situation.

316
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,229
Hey, hey. Just chill out.
It's not that big of an emergency.

317
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,673
Upstairs, downstairs.

318
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,594
How do you like that?

319
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,115
Lady! What is wrong with you?

320
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,149
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.

321
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,673
You're a bad kitty.

322
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,198
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

323
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,033
Looks like I'll have
to take the Stamford local.

324
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,792
I got him! I've got him!

325
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,869
He's got him!

326
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,110
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got...

327
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,599
I got something for you!

328
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,474
I'm OK. I'm OK.

329
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,915
Whoa! What are
you guys doing here?

330
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,549
- I am so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

331
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,916
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

332
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,912
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

333
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,594
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

334
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,113
Because I was wondering...

335
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,237
How could you do this to us?
I thought we were your friends!

336
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,470
What's the big deal?
I was coming back.

337
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,596
Don't ever do this again.
You hear me?

338
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,240
- Do you hear him?
- We're running out of time.

339
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,151
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

340
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,471
...do this again! Don't you ever,
ever do this again!

341
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,955
Come here.

342
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,479
We've been ratted out, boys.

343
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,039
Hold your fire!

344
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,714
Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

345
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,715
If you have any poo, fling it now.

346
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,757
It's the Man.

347
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,838
Good evening, officers.

348
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,831
No. No. No. You don't talk now. OK?

349
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,514
You're not good with the
"putting words together

350
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,319
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh".

351
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,676
Hey! How you doing?
You know what? Everything's cool.

352
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,389
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

353
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,313
My friend went a little crazy.
Happens to everybody.

354
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,358
The city gets to us all.
Went a little cuckoo in the head.

355
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,271
Don't be calling me
cuckoo in the head.

356
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,035
Just shush! I will handle this.

357
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,348
Oh! I got him!

358
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,237
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

359
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,276
Would you give a guy a break?

360
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,759
We'll take my little friend home and
forget this ever happened. All right?

361
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,035
No harm, no foul, right?

362
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,398
Hey, it's cool. It's me,
Alex the lion. From the zoo.

363
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,437
What's the matter with them?

364
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,275
I feel really, really weird.

365
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,673
I love you guys.

366
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,279
I love you so much.

367
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,759
Last night's dramatic incident
in Grand Central

368
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,594
is an example of what animal rights
wackos have been shouting for years:

369
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,911
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,673
They are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

371
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,957
where they will live their lives
in the freedom they desire.

372
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,873
- Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

373
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,719
Do something!

374
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,158
Oh, man.

375
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,039
Oh, my head.

376
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,839
What the...?

377
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,229
Wait. Where? What?

378
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,595
I'm in a box! Oh, no.
No, no! Not the box.

379
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,070
Oh, no, they can't
transfer me. Not me!

380
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,038
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

381
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,997
Darkness creeping in.

382
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,196
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

383
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,316
Walls closing in around me.

384
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,556
So alone. So alone.

385
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,438
- Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

386
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,637
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

387
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,439
- What's going on? You OK?
- This doesn't look good.

388
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,476
- Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

389
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,518
- You're here too!
- I am loving the sound of your voice.

390
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,795
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

391
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,949
Oh, no!

392
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,479
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

393
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,595
Is that Melman?

394
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,274
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

395
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,079
I often doze off
while I'm getting an MRl.

396
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,879
- You're not getting an MRl.
- CAT scan?

397
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,679
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

398
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,036
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no.
No, no, I can't be transferred.

399
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,588
I have an appointment
with Dr Goldberg at 5.00.

400
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,240
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

401
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,788
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

402
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,393
And I am not going HMO.

403
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,119
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be OK.

404
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,637
- We are going to be okizay.
- No, we're not going to be okizay.

405
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,711
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

406
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,270
Because of me?
I fail to see how this is my fault.

407
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,750
- You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

408
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,035
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

409
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,432
"l don't know who I am. I got to go
find myself in the wild." Oh, please.

410
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,592
I did not ask you
to come after me, did l?

411
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,272
He does have a point.

412
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,272
I did say we should stay at the zoo,
but you guys...

413
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,554
Melman, just shut it.

414
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,234
You suggested this idea
to him in the first place.

415
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,675
- Leave Melman out of this.
- Thank you.

416
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,433
Besides, it's not my fault
we were transferred.

417
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,034
Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

418
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,795
- I feel nauseous.
- Melman, you always feel nauseous.

419
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,349
Progress report.

420
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,477
It's an older code, skipper.
I can't make it out.

421
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,596
You, higher mammal.

422
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,033
Can you read?

423
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,112
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

424
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,070
Ship to Kenya.

425
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,720
Wildlife preserve.

426
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,869
Africa!

427
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,952
Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico.

428
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,308
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

429
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,755
- Guys, listen.
- A king. Loved by my people.

430
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,434
- Let's be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

431
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,555
"Loved"?

432
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,679
If the people loved you, it's only
because they didn't know the real you!

433
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,718
Don't make me come up there.
I'll whoop both of y'all.

434
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,233
I thought I knew the real you!

435
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,996
Your black-and-white stripes, they
cancel each other out. You're nothing!

436
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,593
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

437
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,750
You're not helping the situation.

438
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,474
Status.

439
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,596
It's no good.
I don't know the codes.

440
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,309
Don't give me excuses.
Give me results! Navigation.

441
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,750
All right. Let me think.

442
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,398
And shut him up!

443
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,637
- I did it!
- Let's get this tin can turned around.

444
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,189
Guys?

445
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,309
Oh, no.

446
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,595
Gloria!

447
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,954
Melman!

448
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,029
Marty!

449
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,674
Alex!

450
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,235
Marty?!

451
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,870
Alex!

452
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,234
Marty!

453
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,153
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

454
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,119
Don't go.

455
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,393
Marty?

456
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,839
Melman?

457
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,359
Gloria?

458
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,234
Marty?!

459
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,469
Melman?!

460
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,993
Gloria?!

461
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,149
Marty!

462
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,115
Melman! Gloria!

463
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,794
Hey, anyone! Hello!

464
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,950
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

465
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,916
Gloria, Melman, Marty.
Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.

466
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,468
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.

467
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,357
Matt, Katie, Al.

468
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,752
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

469
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,800
Get me out of this thing right now!

470
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,236
Hello? Somebody?

471
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,514
Melman!

472
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,397
Alex? Is that you?

473
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,268
Melman, I got you. Hang on!
Hang on. I got you.

474
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,759
Melman! I got you, buddy.

475
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,668
Wait a sec, Melman.
Wait right there.

476
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,993
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you out of the box.

477
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,510
- Relax.
- Alex?

478
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,948
Giraffe, corner pocket!

479
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,199
Here goes nothing!

480
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,316
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold still!

481
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,833
- Wait, Alex.
- Hold still.

482
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,956
- No, come on.
- Here I come!

483
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,792
Look! Look! Look! Look!

484
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,838
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

485
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,071
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

486
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,229
Oh, my...

487
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,639
Gloria!

488
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,469
Gloria!

489
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,951
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

490
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,029
Gloria!

491
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,553
Alex!

492
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,753
- Marty?!
- Marty!

493
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,799
Yeah! All right! That's right!

494
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,668
Left! Left! Left. No, no,
your left! Your left! Your left!

495
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,273
Right here's good.

496
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,191
I don't have anything on me.
I'll have to get you later.

497
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,313
To you too.

498
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,878
Marty!

499
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,188
Marty!

500
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,233
Alex!

501
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,517
Marty!

502
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,079
Alex!

503
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,434
Marty!

504
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,714
Al!

505
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,995
Marty!

506
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,071
Alex?

507
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,559
Marty!

508
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,710
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

509
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,789
Martin!

510
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,598
- Hold up!
- I'm going to kill you!

511
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,353
- Come here! Don't run away from me!
- Calm down!

512
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,352
If you keep running,
I'm going to just kill you more!

513
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,673
Oh, look at us.

514
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,991
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

515
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,991
Yeah, here we are.

516
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,793
Where exactly is "here"?

517
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,559
San Diego.

518
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,119
San Diego?

519
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,679
White sandy beaches,

520
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,719
cleverly simulated natural
environment, wide-open enclosures.

521
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,758
I'm telling you,
this could be the San Diego Zoo.

522
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,796
Complete with fake rocks.

523
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,632
Wow, that looks real.

524
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,713
San Diego? What could
be worse than San Diego?

525
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,792
I don't know.
This place is crackalacking!

526
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,872
Oh, I could hang here.
I could hang here.

527
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,552
- I'll kill you!
- Take it easy!

528
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,198
- Strangle you!
- Calm down.

529
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,238
Then bury you, dig you up,
clone you and kill your clones.

530
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,039
- 20-second timeout.
- I'll never talk to you again.

531
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,634
Now, look. We're just
going to find the people,

532
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,952
get checked in
and have this mess straightened out.

533
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,515
Oh, great.
This is just great. San Diego.

534
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,388
Now I'll have to compete
with Shamu and his smug little grin.

535
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,391
I can't top that. Can't top it.

536
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,916
I'm ruined! I'm done.
I'm out of the business.

537
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,072
It's your fault, Marty!
You've ruined me.

538
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,720
Come on, Alex.
Do you honestly think

539
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,950
I intended all of this to happen?

540
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,873
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

541
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,030
OK, I'm...

542
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,519
He just shushed me.

543
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,558
Marty, you've got
to be just a little bit more und...

544
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,874
- Don't you shush me.
- Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?

545
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,313
- I hear it.
- Where there's music, there's people.

546
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,994
- Go to the head honcho.
- A sidewalk would be nice.

547
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,433
Yeah, what a dump.

548
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,750
They should call it
the San Di-lame-o Zoo.

549
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,868
First they tell you, "We got this great
open plan thing. Let animals run wild."

550
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,475
Next thing, flowers in your hair,
everybody's hugging everybody.

551
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,677
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

552
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,354
What the...?

553
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,789
Oh, no!

554
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,712
OK, let's make
a good impression on the people.

555
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,633
Smiles, everyone.
Let's get it together.

556
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,076
- Is that the best you can do?
- Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

557
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,355
Well, great.
Let's make gas look good.

558
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,275
- Wow!
- It's not people. It's animals.

559
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,590
California animals. Dude.

560
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,398
This is like a Puffy party.

561
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,476
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

562
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,471
- Ya like to
- Move it

563
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,836
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

564
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,592
I like to move it, move it

565
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,636
- Ya like to
- Move it

566
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,917
I like to move it, move it
You like to move it, move it

567
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,638
She like to move it, move it

568
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,153
- He like to
- Move it

569
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,708
All girls all over the world

570
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,917
Original King Julien
'pon yer case, man

571
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,276
I love how all the girls
that love to move their body

572
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,237
When ya move your body, ya do

573
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,437
Move it nice
and sweet and sassy, all right

574
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,839
What kind of zoo is this?

575
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,151
I just saw 26 blatant
health code violations.

576
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,152
I'm loving San Diego.
This place is off the chizain.

577
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,229
Twenty-seven.

578
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,670
Woman, physically fit, physically fit

579
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,673
Physically, physically, physically fit
Physically fit, Physically fit

580
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,671
We should've brought chips and dip.

581
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,909
Wait.

582
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,629
Where's Alex? What happened to him?
He was right behind us. Wasn't he?

583
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,996
I don't know where he's at,
but he's missing one heck of a party.

584
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,638
The fossa!

585
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,073
The fossa!

586
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,754
The fossa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

587
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,074
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

588
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,990
I hate spiderwebs.

589
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,911
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

590
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,072
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

591
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,629
Hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

592
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,871
Because we've been sitting
on that beach there for hours,

593
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,315
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

594
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,631
I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

595
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,757
but there's been some sort
of major screw-up, which is cool.

596
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,389
If you could point us towards
the administrative offices, we'll...

597
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,469
Well, howdy-do.

598
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,709
Spider! Spider! Spider on my back!

599
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,712
Maurice, did you see that?

600
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,916
He scared the fossa away.

601
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,951
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

602
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,796
Get it! Get it! Get it!

603
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,314
- That's it! Smack it!
- Get it, get it!

604
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,550
Whip it! Whip it good!
Where'd it go?

605
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,633
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?!

606
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,475
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

607
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,792
They've come to kill us. And take
our women. And our precious metals.

608
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,395
Get up, Mort. Do not
be near the king's feet, OK?

609
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,790
We're hiding. Be quiet,
everyone. Including me.

610
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,518
Who's making that noise?

611
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,749
Oh, it's me again.

612
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,956
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

613
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,157
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- I think she got it.

614
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,595
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

615
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,752
It's OK. It's gone.

616
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,229
They are savages.

617
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,514
Tonight we die.

618
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,512
The feet. I told you...
I told you to... I told every...

619
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,397
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

620
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,508
He did tell you about the feet.

621
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,878
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

622
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,155
I have devised a cunning test

623
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,835
to see whether
these are savage killers.

624
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,112
Hi there.

625
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,478
You let me handle it.
Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

626
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,039
Hi there.

627
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,910
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

628
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,993
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- Stop. Stop. It's OK. It's OK.

629
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,595
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

630
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,554
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

631
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,108
Did that big mean lion scare you?

632
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,478
He did? He's a big,
bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

633
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,597
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Aww, look at you.

634
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,875
They are cute
from a reasonable distance.

635
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,192
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

636
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,033
They're just a bunch of pansies.

637
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,155
I don't know.

638
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,152
There's something
about that one with the crazy hairdo

639
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,276
that I find suspicious.

640
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,918
Nonsense, Maurice.

641
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,834
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

642
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,395
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien XIII,

643
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,075
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
et cetera. Hooray, everybody.

644
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,033
He's got style.

645
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,949
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

646
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,319
I think it's a squirrel.

647
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,358
Welcome, giant pansies.

648
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,159
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

649
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,549
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep. Squirrel.

650
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,758
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the fossa.

651
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,876
- The "whossa"?
- The fossa.

652
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,714
They annoy us by trespassing,
interrupting our parties

653
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,677
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Good.

654
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,558
We're trying to find out
where the people are, so...

655
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,676
What big teeth you have. Man!

656
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,833
Shame on you, Maurice. Can you not
see that you have insulted the freak?

657
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,868
You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

658
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,873
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

659
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,077
And just where are you giants from?

660
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,116
We're from New York and...

661
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,790
All hail the New York giants!

662
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,030
New York giants!

663
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,435
Is this some sort of
inbreeding programme?

664
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,432
I say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

665
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,717
Excuse me. We bozos
have the people, of course.

666
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,708
Hey, the bozos have the people.

667
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,156
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

668
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,593
They're up there.

669
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,073
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

670
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,275
Wow.

671
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,954
So do you have any live people?

672
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,717
No. Only dead ones.

673
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,598
I mean, if we had
a lot of live people here,

674
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,116
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it?

675
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,394
The wild?

676
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,438
Whoa. Hold up there
a second, fuzzbucket.

677
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,839
You mean, like,

678
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,312
the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

679
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,868
- Who wipes?
- Oy vey.

680
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,598
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

681
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,511
Oy vey!

682
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,830
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

683
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,192
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

684
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,994
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

685
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,116
I'm swimming back to New York.

686
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,033
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

687
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,556
- You can't swim!
- I said my chances are slim!

688
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,270
Nature! It's all over me!
Get it off! I can't see! I can't see!

689
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,711
I can see!

690
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,874
Look. There's obviously
been a little mistake.

691
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,349
The people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

692
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,479
As soon as they realise what happened,
they'll come looking for us, right?

693
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,629
Yeah, right.

694
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,554
I don't know the words
But we're born free

695
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,030
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

696
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,471
Well, boys, it's going
to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

697
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,759
Rico.

698
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,279
Well, since I'm doomed
to die on this forsaken island,

699
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,555
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

700
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,837
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

701
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,959
have divided my estate
equally among the three of you.

702
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,395
Sorry, Alex.

703
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,917
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

704
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,752
No, it's not a latrine.

705
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,913
It's a grave. You sent Melman
to his grave. Are you happy?

706
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,319
Aw, come on.

707
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,676
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

708
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,910
This could be the best that's happened.

709
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,877
No. No. No. No.

710
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,158
No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not
the best thing that's happened to us.

711
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,074
You abused the power of the birthday
wish and brought bad luck on all of us.

712
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,674
Why'd you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to.

713
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,228
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

714
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,710
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, OK.

715
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,270
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

716
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,920
Look around. There's no fences,
no schedules.

717
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,514
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

718
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,955
OK. OK. I've had enough of this.

719
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,795
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

720
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,474
That is the bad side,
where you can prance and skip

721
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,757
Iike a magical pixie horse
and do whatever the heck you want.

722
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,674
This is the good side for those who
love New York and care about going home.

723
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,433
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

724
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,192
You know what? This isn't good.

725
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,398
OK! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

726
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,233
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

727
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,074
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

728
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,639
This is the fun side,

729
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,871
where we'll have a great time
surviving until we go home.

730
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,599
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- This side's the best.

731
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,956
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this cesspool!

732
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,190
- Wilma!
- Now what do we do?

733
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,589
Don't worry. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

734
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,594
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

735
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,190
Just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

736
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,912
Shut up, Spalding.

737
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,718
I've been standing
here for hours, man.

738
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,360
How long do I have
to pose like this?

739
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,435
She is finito.

740
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,915
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles

741
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,991
to miss this baby.

742
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,073
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

743
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,709
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

744
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,712
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

745
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,678
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman?
- Great. Idiot.

746
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,159
I heard that.

747
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,754
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

748
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,834
That's wild fire. We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

749
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,639
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

750
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,111
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it!

751
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,469
Fire.

752
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,589
Fire.

753
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,150
Fire! Fire!

754
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,109
Oh, my...

755
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,715
Fire!

756
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,597
Not yet! No, no! No!

757
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,079
Fire!

758
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,479
Melman, hold still!

759
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,158
Jump! Alex, jump!

760
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,356
Don't worry,
cats always land on their...

761
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,079
Face? Man,
what kind of cat are you?

762
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,197
You maniac!

763
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,670
You burned it up!

764
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,912
Darn you!

765
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,719
Darn you all to heck!

766
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,190
Can we go to the fun side now?

767
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,398
Everybody, calm down.
Come on. Into your chairs.

768
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,199
Everybody, calm down.
Let go of his tail.

769
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,635
Separate those two,
would you, please?

770
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,109
You here, you there. Everyone...

771
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,794
Calm down, people, OK?

772
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,953
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

773
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,077
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

774
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,673
Now, everybody,

775
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,197
we all have great curiosity
about our guests, the New York giants.

776
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,077
- Yes, Willie?
- I like them.

777
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,948
I like them. I liked them first.
Before I even met them I liked them.

778
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,715
I liked them right away. You hate
them compared to how much I like them.

779
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,916
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

780
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,117
Now, for as long
as we can remember,

781
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,796
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded fossa.

782
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,440
The fossa! The fossa are attacking!

783
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,190
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

784
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,793
Please. Maurice.

785
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,558
Quiet!

786
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,599
Come on, y'all. They're not
attacking us this very instant.

787
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,237
So my genius plan is this:

788
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,629
We will make the New York giants

789
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,473
our friends and keep them close.

790
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,711
Then, with Mr Alex protecting us,

791
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,997
we will be safe
and never have to worry

792
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,709
about the dreaded fossa ever again.

793
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,715
I thought of that.
I thought of that. Yes. Me. I did.

794
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,519
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.
I'm just thinking now.

795
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,273
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the fossa

796
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,828
were so scared of Mr Alex?

797
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,071
I mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

798
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,072
What if Mr Alex
is even worse than the fossa?

799
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,597
I tell you, that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

800
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,035
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

801
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,669
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

802
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,920
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

803
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,389
No? Good. So shut up.

804
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,553
When the New York giants wake up,

805
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,078
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

806
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,595
Now, who would like a cookie?

807
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,870
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

808
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,394
There's room
on the fun side for one more.

809
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,993
No, thanks.

810
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,073
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

811
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,038
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

812
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,476
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

813
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,357
I just want to go home.

814
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,274
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

815
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,958
It really isn't
the fun side without you.

816
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,678
I know. And then...

817
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,556
- It's him.
- Who is it?

818
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,191
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

819
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,795
Yes? Can I help you?

820
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,913
Can I come to the fun side?

821
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,555
Beg your pardon?

822
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,430
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.

823
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,756
But I've been thinking
about what you said, and I'm sorry.

824
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,275
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

825
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,271
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

826
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,033
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

827
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,079
Very impressive.

828
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,118
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.

829
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,994
This is seawater.

830
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,675
You don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

831
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,637
Hey, y'all look hungry.

832
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,272
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

833
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:31,952
You have food?

834
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,793
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

835
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,431
Seaweed on a stick.

836
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,909
Seaweed?

837
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,272
On a stick.
Don't love it till you try it.

838
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,358
That's unbelievable.

839
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,711
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

840
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,473
It does kind of hit the spot,
doesn't it?

841
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,557
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

842
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,518
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

843
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,272
Oh, but it does.

844
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,399
Check this out.

845
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,268
Wow. Would you look at that.

846
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,672
It's like billions
and billions of helicopters.

847
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,069
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

848
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,152
Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak?

849
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,673
You know what, Alex?

850
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,197
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

851
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,474
Thanks, Marty.

852
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,518
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

853
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,909
I think I'm going to
hit the sack too.

854
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,797
Sweet dreams, everyone.

855
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,159
Alex.

856
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,398
What are you doing?

857
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,512
Twenty-seven, 28, 29.
Thirty black and only 29 white.

858
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,433
Looks like you're black
with white stripes after all.

859
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,636
Dilemma solved. Good night.

860
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,550
You see, Maurice,
Mr Alex was grooming his friend.

861
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,916
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

862
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,753
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr Alex?

863
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,389
Look at him.
He's so cute and plushy.

864
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,789
I don't think he was grooming him.

865
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,314
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

866
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,517
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

867
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,639
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

868
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,280
All we have to do is wait

869
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,909
until they are deep in their sleep.

870
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,153
How long is this going to take?!

871
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,833
Well, this sucks!

872
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,639
Wake up, Mr Alex.

873
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,188
Wake up, Mr Alex.

874
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,432
Rise and shining.

875
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,592
Wakey-waking, Mr Alex!

876
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,079
Wake up! Alex!

877
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,789
You suck your thumb?

878
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,188
Where are we?
What the heck is going on?

879
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,430
Where's the beach?
Take it easy.

880
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,398
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

881
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,708
While you were asleep,

882
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,679
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

883
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,910
Welcome to Madagascar.

884
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,389
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

885
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,755
No, not whooha. Ascar.

886
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,678
Marty. It's...

887
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,228
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

888
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,313
Oh, no, fella, that is
the real deal right there.

889
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,197
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

890
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,193
That's the thing that you were always
looking at, but it's actually there.

891
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,716
- That's the real version of...
- How about once around the park?

892
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,872
Let's get our blood pumping,
lungs breathing fresh air.

893
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,279
Who's with me?!

894
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,715
Naw. I don't think I could...
You're it!

895
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,358
Hey! Want to play around?

896
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,595
Got you there!

897
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,033
Come here!

898
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,475
You're it.

899
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,199
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

900
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,234
OK, Marty, I'm it.

901
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,709
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

902
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,155
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

903
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,037
I haven't eaten in two days.

904
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,078
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

905
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,991
I don't think that's your problem.

906
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,640
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

907
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,631
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!

908
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,597
You have
to let out that inner lion.

909
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,911
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

910
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,072
You are, that's who.
Come on! Here we go!

911
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,754
That's it. Let's build up
some steam! You the cat.

912
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,398
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

913
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,072
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

914
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,550
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

915
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,553
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

916
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,558
I'm the cat!

917
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,553
Surprise!

918
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,193
You're it. You're it!

919
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,430
Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick.

920
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,434
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

921
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,312
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

922
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,720
Man! I feel different.

923
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,997
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

924
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,470
Kind of charged up or something.

925
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,199
- Like you said, baby, it's...
- Crackalacking.

926
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,558
- Ain't that right, Melman?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

927
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,678
I'm in heaven.

928
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,436
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend
and the fossas are nowhere to be seen.

929
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,273
It could be said
that my plan is working

930
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,557
in a very good working kind of way.

931
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,598
Alex. You got to try some of this.

932
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,509
I feel good.
Feel like a king again.

933
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,435
King?

934
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,918
You should see his act.

935
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,072
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act.

936
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,958
Oh. No, I really
don't think I could... OK.

937
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,157
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

938
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,276
The wild proudly presents:

939
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,759
The king.

940
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,434
Alex the lion!

941
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,629
E flat, fellas.

942
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,354
Yeah! The king is in the house!

943
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,069
See, if he is the king, then where
is his crown? I've got a crown.

944
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,152
Got a very nice one.
And it's here on my head.

945
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,151
Look at it. Have I got it on?

946
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,077
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

947
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,197
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

948
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,396
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

949
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,075
Break out the wave!

950
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,950
Excuse me.

951
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,156
You're biting my butt.

952
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,709
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

953
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,591
- What did you do?
- You just bit me!

954
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,750
No. I didn't. Did l?

955
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,273
You kind of did.

956
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,351
What the heck is wrong with you?

957
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,235
Why'd you bite me?

958
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,073
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.
- What?!

959
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,310
- Excuse me?
- That's dumb.

960
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,632
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple
bite on the buttocks among friends?

961
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,472
Here, give me a nibble.

962
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,109
The party is over, Julien.
Your brilliant plan has failed.

963
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,872
What are you talking about?

964
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,678
Your friend here is what we call

965
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,638
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

966
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,551
And he eats steak...

967
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,073
...which is you.

968
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,119
- Get out of here.
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

969
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,918
The plan failed.

970
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,151
All is lost! We're all doomed.

971
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,791
The fossas will come back and
gobble us with their mouths because...

972
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,189
...we are all steak.

973
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,077
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

974
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,276
Mr Alex cannot stay here.

975
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,433
He belongs with his own kind
on the fossa side of the island.

976
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,397
By the power vested in me,

977
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,597
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

978
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,795
Be gone!

979
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,599
What? Come on, do I look
like a steak to you?

980
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,829
Yeah!

981
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,673
See, I told you I don't
look like a... What you say?

982
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,035
Oh, yeah!

983
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,910
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives.

984
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,398
Marty, run!

985
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,118
A bull's eye.
Excellent shot, Maurice.

986
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,235
Thank you.

987
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,628
Marty?

988
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,797
I'm so sorry, Marty.

989
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,719
What is wrong with me?

990
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,030
Ow.

991
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,792
Oh, no.

992
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,472
What have I done?

993
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,518
It's true. I'm a monster.

994
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,477
I got to get out of here.

995
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,911
What have I done?
This is a nightmare.

996
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,672
And it's all my fault.

997
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,558
Now, because of me,
we've lost Alex.

998
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,198
Well, what are we going to do?

999
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,840
We'll find a way to help him.
That's what we'll do.

1000
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:27,909
OK.

1001
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,594
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?

1002
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,750
We're tough.
We're gritty.

1003
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,558
We're adaptable!

1004
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,438
We are not going
to lay down like a bunch of Melmans.

1005
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,875
No, we're not.

1006
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,109
Oh. Gloria.

1007
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,192
That was not me, OK?
That was the boat.

1008
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,351
- The boat!
- The boat?

1009
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,274
The boat's come back for us!
Come on, guys, we got to flag it down.

1010
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,269
There it is!

1011
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,191
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

1012
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,713
Over here! Yo!

1013
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,314
Melman, give me a lift.
Hurry up! Lift me up!

1014
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,753
Help! Help! Help!

1015
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,513
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.
- Over here!

1016
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,195
- Melman! Steady. This way!
- You have no idea how much this hurts.

1017
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,077
Hey, boat! We're over here!

1018
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,073
Look! It's turning! It's coming back!
It's coming back!

1019
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,355
Come on! Come on, baby!

1020
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,118
Yes! You guys.

1021
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,395
You flag down that boat.
I'll get Alex.

1022
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,199
Whoa! Hold on there.

1023
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,555
You cannot go back there by yourself.

1024
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,790
Aw, come on. I know Alex.

1025
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,599
He hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it.

1026
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,955
The people are coming.
They can help us.

1027
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,918
Melman's right. The people
will know what to do.

1028
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,070
Now, we got to flag down that boat.

1029
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,314
Now, this is more like it.

1030
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,631
You?! Oh, ma...
Where are the people?

1031
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,517
We killed them and ate their livers.

1032
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,709
Got you, didn't l?

1033
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,360
Just kidding, doll,
the people are fine.

1034
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,559
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.

1035
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,915
Hey, I know you two.

1036
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,278
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

1037
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,114
Marty? He's righ... Where did
he go? He was right behind us.

1038
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,636
He went back for Alex.
He's going to get himself killed!

1039
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,678
Well, boys, our
monochromatic friend's in danger.

1040
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,637
Looks like we have a job to do.

1041
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,553
Captain's log: Embarking
into hostile environment.

1042
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,076
Kowalski. We'll need to win
hearts and the minds of the natives.

1043
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,355
Rico. We'll need
tactical equipment.

1044
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,954
We're going to face extreme peril.

1045
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,315
Private probably won't survive.

1046
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,638
Alex! Come out, Alex!

1047
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,870
The boat's here! We can go home!

1048
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:10,029
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1049
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,597
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1050
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,993
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1051
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:21,629
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1052
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,994
Alex!

1053
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,869
Alex!

1054
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,153
Marty?

1055
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,789
Snap out of it, Alex. The boat
came back. We can get out of here.

1056
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,793
We can go back to civilization, and
everything will be like it used to be.

1057
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,279
Stay back.

1058
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,309
Please.

1059
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,277
I'm a monster.

1060
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,511
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

1061
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,558
We're a team.
You and me, remember?

1062
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,156
I don't want to hurt you.

1063
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,992
Alex.

1064
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,071
I ain't leaving without you.

1065
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,391
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

1066
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,314
It's a wonderful song.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

1067
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,275
Start spreadin' the news

1068
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,995
I'm leaving today

1069
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,436
We are a great big part of it

1070
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,959
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

1071
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,508
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

1072
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,637
You really don't want
to hear me sing this by myself.

1073
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,715
Uh, Alex? Could you
come out here for a minute?

1074
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,076
Hey, Alex, a little help.

1075
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,188
Help me!

1076
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,356
Alex! Help!

1077
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,239
Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody!

1078
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,235
Help!

1079
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,513
- Melman?
- Right, baby.

1080
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,319
Run!

1081
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,437
- What's the plan?
- This is.

1082
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,033
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

1083
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,236
This is the plan?

1084
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,548
Fossa halt.

1085
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,389
Fossa ooh.

1086
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,991
Fossa aaahh.

1087
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,509
Fossa ooh.

1088
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,235
Fossa aaahh.

1089
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,792
Come and get it.

1090
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,677
Fossa.

1091
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,877
- Take that.
- Fossa ow!

1092
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,235
There's too many of them, skipper.

1093
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,278
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

1094
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,075
Alex?

1095
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,513
That's my kill.

1096
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,874
Mine.

1097
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,233
Alex hungry.

1098
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,719
Alex eat.

1099
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,188
It's showtime.

1100
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,872
Thanks for not giving up on me.

1101
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,628
Man, you almost gave me a heart attack.
You can't just come sneak up on me.

1102
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,553
Just because you're a lion...
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1103
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,916
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

1104
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,991
Like I said, it's showtime.

1105
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,475
Mine.

1106
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,108
My kill.

1107
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,272
They're all mine.

1108
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,317
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!

1109
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,277
- Don't eat me!
- He's big and scary!

1110
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,591
Fear me! Savagery
beyond comprehension.

1111
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:06,389
- I am far too young to die!
- You're a monster! A monster, I say!

1112
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,914
- And, you!
- Me?

1113
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,430
Oh, you want some of this? Ooh!
You better run for your lives.

1114
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,832
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

1115
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,199
This is my territory.
Understand?

1116
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,199
I never, ever want
to see you on my turf again.

1117
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,589
Boo.

1118
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,158
Yeah! You the cat!

1119
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,954
Got my boy back!

1120
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,793
I did it!

1121
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,759
Give me some love! The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

1122
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,991
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

1123
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,116
I am very clever king.

1124
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,393
I am super genius.

1125
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,994
I am robot king of the monkey things.

1126
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,390
- Compute, compute.
- So, what's for lunch?

1127
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,477
- Close those eyes.
- Why do I have to?

1128
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,993
- Do it.
- They're closed.

1129
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,832
- Tighter.
- Yes, sir.

1130
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,592
- No peeking.
- They're closed.

1131
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,318
Rico.

1132
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,069
Hai.

1133
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,829
Open that hatch.

1134
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,149
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

1135
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,434
Chew like you mean it.
Savour it.

1136
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,918
- And?
- Well?

1137
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,752
Pretty good, right?

1138
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,149
There's always Plan B.

1139
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,591
This is better than steak.

1140
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,318
I love it. I love it!

1141
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,311
The kitty loves the fishy.

1142
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,236
Well, I propose a toast.

1143
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,118
Now, he may be a pain
in the butt at times...

1144
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,236
And trust me, I know.

1145
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,914
But this cat proved
to me without a doubt

1146
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,355
that his heart
is bigger than his stomach.

1147
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,112
- To Alex.
- To Alex.

1148
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,633
Enough! Stop it!

1149
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,392
What do you think?
Should we head back to New York?

1150
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,789
I don't know. I mean,
this is your dream.

1151
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,836
You sure you want to leave?

1152
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,797
I don't care where we are.

1153
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,952
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

1154
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,598
Well, in that case...

1155
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,717
Yo. Rico.
I'll take 300 orders to go.

1156
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,028
Hai.

1157
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,749
But before you leave,
I have an announcement to make.

1158
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,638
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

1159
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:46,077
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

1160
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,390
I have decided to thank you

1161
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,074
for bringing peace to our home.

1162
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,718
And to make you feel good,

1163
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,519
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

1164
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,353
No, I couldn't. Really,
I can't take your crown.

1165
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,795
That's OK,
I've got a bigger crown.

1166
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,074
It's got a gecko on it.

1167
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,232
Look at him shake.
Go, Stevie, go!

1168
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,874
- Bye, fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1169
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,439
- So long!
- Bye-bye, now.

1170
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,078
- Arrivederci.
- Bye-bye.

1171
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,628
- Toodle-oo!
- See you later, crocodile.

1172
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,678
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

1173
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,710
Faster, you naughty little monkey.

1174
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,951
By the time we get to New York,
it'll be the middle of winter.

1175
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,951
So I was just thinking, why rush?

1176
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,838
Maybe we could make
a few side stops along the way.

1177
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,229
- Maybe Paris.
- You just read my mind.

1178
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,595
- I was thinking Spain.
- Run with the bulls.

1179
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,353
- What about Fiji?
- Canada. Can we?

1180
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,237
Cheap meds.

1181
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,834
I wouldn't even mind
coming back here sometime.

1182
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,229
- I could do that.
- You could say that again.

1183
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,039
- Skipper?
- I always wanted to go to Australia.

1184
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,590
Don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

1185
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,749
Nah.

1186
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,549
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

1187
01:15:55,305 --> 01:16:01,472
