00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,923
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Cronyn.

4
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,721
Thank you.

5
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,031
It isn't exactly cozy,
darling, but it's home.

6
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,762
And I thought
I was living
on a grand scale

7
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,532

a five-room apartment.

Hello, my darling!

Hello, Mother.

10
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,572
Mother,
this is Holly.

11
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,176
Welcome, Holly.
I hope you'll be
very happy.

how I love
to stage weddings.

15
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,319
That's exactly
why we did it.

16
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,394
This is your home now,
my dear.

17
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,540
It's magnificent.

18

a sneaking hunch

23

they drowned
the girls at birth.

24

the courage to face

25

one of these pirates
and say, "It's a girl"?

26

Holly, my dear,
I'm sure you're longing
to unpack and relax.

27
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,222
Let me show you
your room.

28

You've changed
the colors in here.

29

it should be fresh
for the new bride.

If ashes of roses
doesn't please you,

31
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,376
you must pick
something that does.

32

I won't be offended.

33

It's difficult to choose
for someone
you've never met.

34
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,682
It was kind of you
to bother.

35

Not at all,
I wanted you
to feel welcome.

36

Clay will want
to show you
the house.

I'll acquaint you with
the inner workings later.

38

48

Phil and I
were in last year's
Bermuda Race.

49
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,601
Yes, in different boats.
Mine came in last.

have lunch sometime.

it's the facade that counts.

Well, that's hardly unique
to Fairfield County.

tell the difference

you want?

why are you going
to North Africa?

Because reputations
can be made in places
like North Africa,

133
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,032
and being

Wait till you hear. Elsa
arranged the blind date,

159
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,245
and who do you suppose
it turned out to be?

160
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,687
That phony prince.
Oh, no!

161

I can't believe that
you didn't hear about it.

If I were

I wouldn't
leave you alone

Can you escape
from the Ice Palace?

171

That's not the question.

Isn't it?
Aren't you an escapee tonight?

173
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,033
I don't find that amusing.

174
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,904
I'm sorry.
I hoped you would.

175
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,069
I'll try to think
of another gambit.

What is it,
Holly?

177

I think if Clay doesn't
come back soon,

178
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,891
I'll go out of my mind.

Well, it's your own fault.
You stay cooped up
too much.

You turned down
four parties
this week.

They can't be changed,

The rumba was
invented for you.

It suits you much better
than the minuet.

Well,
the minuet's all right,

dance it alone.

You make me feel
like a woman again.

could possibly miss

the fact you're a woman.

I'm sorry,
but this isn't my year

318
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,467

so unloved.

Estelle,
a terrible thing
has happened!

355
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,476
So you killed your lover,
my girl?

356
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,481
Oh, no! No, no, no.
It was an accident!

357
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,143
I knew what you were
the moment
I laid eyes on you.

358
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,210
Please, listen to me.
Your scarf was brought back
by a detective.

359
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,381
Fortunately,
he worked for me.
Worked?

360
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:02,358
I had you followed
to protect my son
against just this moment.

361
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,296
You don't mean that.
You can't mean that.

362
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,659
Let me tell you
how it happened.

363
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,360
I don't care
how it happened.

There's no
further need for pretense.

00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:14,963
I blame myself.

366
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,304
You've been an embarrassment
from the day
you entered this house!

But how?
Tell me how.
To what purpose?

368
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,013

any more than you can help
what you aren't.

You've always been in

You couldn't cope.
Just as you can't
cope now.

You're still

You should've stayed
on the other side
of the counter.

Where are you going?
To call the police.

My detective
has already
called the police.

It was careless of you
to leave this.

It could so easily
turn into a noose.

In the name of God,
Estelle!

378

It’ll be an unsavory trial.

Philip Benton had
quite a reputation
among the bedroom set.

380

But I was never
going to see
Phil again.

381
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,145
I only went
to his apartment
to tell him.

382
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,484
I swear
it's the truth.
Please believe me!

383
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,889
The prosecution will say
you quarreled and
pushed him to his death.

384
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,450
No!
Even if a clever attorney
gets you off,

385
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,554
the mud will cling.
You will never be
free of it,

nor will your husband
or your son!

I have the means at hand.

391
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,009
Why would you
want to help me?

392
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,711
To be rid of you!

393
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:40,613
You'll have to give up
my son and grandson
for all time.

394

I'd do that?

395

Then stay.
Face trial!

396
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,187
I will before I'll leave
my husband and child.

397
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,234
If you do, I'll go to court
and fight for that boy,
and I'll get him!

every breath in my body before
I'll let you take my child!

401
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:02,109
You have no child! You
forfeited him when you became
involved with Phil Benton.

402
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,774
Estelle, please.

403
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,855
Please, I'll get
on my knees to you.
I'll do anything you ask.

404
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,153
But don't try to
take my baby.

405
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,283
You'd rob him
of his birthright?

406
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,488
Well, if you won't
protect him, I must!
Clay! I have to talk to Clay.

00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,497
Is he to be sacrificed,
too?

408

Are you bent on dragging
both father and son
to destruction with you?

becomes public?

And even if he chose
to sacrifice himself,

you actually believe there can
ever be any happiness

What kind of fish?

490
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,906
A big fish.

How about
your prayers?

492
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:45,117
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep. Amen.

493
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,057
If I should die
before I wake...

If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord
my soul to take. Amen.

Are you gonna
stay in here?

For a while.

497
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,248
Mommy,
what's die?

498
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,055
To die is
to go away.

499
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:23,858
To go away where?

500
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,025
To another life.

501
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,498
Would you
be there?

502
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,534
Some day.

503
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:37,335
I don't want to die
before I wake
unless you're there.

504
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,571
But you won't.
What your prayer
means is,

00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,881
"Dear Lord,
keep me safe
till morning."

506
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,746
I want it to be
morning now.

00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:50,219
I don't like tonight.
I'm scared.

All right, I will.
I've longed for you.

I've searched for you.
I've dreamed of you.

Don't, Christian,
don't!

You've asked me to be serious.
I honor that request.

You don't know

If a man has trouble
tying it frontwards,

770
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,922
We can get a plane
out of here tomorrow.

771
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:00,322
Well, I can't leave
until my funds come.

772
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,830
Have them forward them
to you in New York.

773
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,196
New York?
Yes.

774
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:09,034
I have good connections there,
and it's a good place
to pick up a wardrobe.

775
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:12,630
New York.
I've already paid
your hotel bill here.

776
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,209
You take a lot for granted.

777
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,373
I just don't take no
for an answer.

778
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,650
All right, I'll go
a few rounds with you.

779
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,316
But I warn you,
if you're thinking of playing
against me, think again.

780
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:32,551
What makes you so suspicious?

781
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:34,459
Experience, friend.

782
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,705
Everything's fine, fine.
I like your hair.

783
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:31,085
I'm beat.
I haven't worked so hard
on myself for years.

784
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:34,520
I couldn't locate
any absinthe. You'll have
to settle for a whiskey.

785
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,421
I'd settle for
denatured alcohol.

786
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,550
Take it easy, honey,

787
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,958
I've got a friend coming up.

788
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,668
Weren't there any
New York papers today?

789
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,805
I thought you might
want to see some
Connecticut ones.

790
01:06:58,881 --> 01:06:59,973
Why?

791
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,778
Auld lang syne.

792
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,681

01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,127
You told me you did.

797
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,927
Well, I was drunk.

798
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:28,777
Keep drinking, honey.
I like you better
drunk than sober.

799

I like the world better
drunk than sober. I can forget

witness actually saw her fall
overboard, the mother-in-law.

803
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,922
And she could have had
her own reasons for saying so.

the waters for 48 hours,
so did the Coast Guard.

That's right.
They never found the body.

If she didn't drown,
where was she?

807
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,563
Someone must
have picked her up.

808
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,041
Holly Anderson
was front-page news.
It would have been reported.

809
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,772
No, no.
Not if her disappearance
was planned.

810
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:08,043
Harry, those clippings
you dug up nailed her.

I told you I'd struck oil.

814

It'll take careful handling.
The Governor won't
be easy to get to.

It's nice to meet you.

01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:33,568
Danny,
I'm all fuddled tonight.

821
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:37,169
I forgot what
I'm supposed to say
about falling overboard.

822
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:38,838
Did you fall overboard?

823
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:41,212
Well, how did you
tell me to say it happened?

824
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,114
I didn't tell you
to say it happened.

825
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:45,415
But you did, Danny.
Don't you remember?

826
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:49,049
I didn't tell you to say
anything. Don't you
try to get cute with me.

827
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,423
Well, shouldn't I have asked
it in front of Mr. Carter?

828
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,428
You wouldn't try
to con an old pal,
would you, Danny?

829
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:55,054
Don't pay any
attention to her.
She's tanked.

830
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,294
But I'm trying, Danny.
I need a little time
to get it down pat.

831
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:00,665
Rotten, lying...
Now, wait a minute.

832

Are you Holly Parker Anderson?

01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,368
What do you want
me to say, Danny?

834
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,740
The truth.
Tell him who you are.

You drunken rip.

I crawl in the same gutter

Do you think
I could get in the
back door of a decent house?

840

He thought he could
put me in respectable
clothes, and I'd pull it off,

Danny, I think I'll pass.

Listen, I'm cutting you in
on a good thing, Harry.

01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:39,565

No, just not buying.

How could you possibly think

853
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,489
I was anything
but the brass ring?

You're Holly Anderson.

Why, you poor, pathetic
garbage-collector. You're a
bigger loser than I am.

856
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,570
Maybe Governor Anderson
won't agree with you.

857
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,299
You won't get near
Governor Anderson.

858
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,604
All right,
then I'll have a little
talk with Junior Anderson.

859
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,645
He's not hard to get to.

860
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:20,179
Would you want me
to go with you?

861
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,118
You wouldn't go.

862
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:32,660
You can't make a sale
without showing
your merchandise.

863
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:37,427
And this merchandise
wants a 50-50% cut.
Just you and me, no outsiders.

864
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,561
So that's it.

865
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:44,231
That's it, Danny.
Half the pie.

866
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,071
All right,

867
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,369
get your coat.

868
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,314
Yes, Danny.

869
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,947
When I walked in,
there she was with the stiff.

870
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,054
"Get the police," she said.
"I killed a man."

871
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,682
Okay, son, okay.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

872
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:38,591
We'll let you know
when we need you.

873
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:41,152
My guess is
he's been dead two hours.

874
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:44,298
We'll know better
when the coroner gets here.

875
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,337
Are you gonna
tell us your name, lady?

876
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,508
Come on, lady.
Now let's have that name.

877
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,384
You find anything
that might tell us who she is?

878
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,912
Nothing. Best I can turn up
is an empty picture frame.

879
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:18,994
Something was
burned in this basket.
Looks like a passport folder.

880
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,944
Blood pressure, low.
No reaction to pain.

881
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,413
Doesn't respond
to oral command.

882
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:36,277
Give her 10 milligrams
of Nalline.

883
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:40,345
If she doesn't
come around in 15 minutes,
we'll try another five.

884
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:44,754
Well?

885
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:48,488
I think I'll send her over
to Psycho for observation.

886
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:54,758
No. I killed him.

887
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,705
I'll sign a confession.

888
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,737
I want to sign a confession.

889
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:12,249
Dr. Evans, will you witness
this signature, please?

890
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,324
Good morning.

891
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,305
I've been appointed
by the court to defend you.

892
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,217
I can understand
that you'd like someone
older, more experienced.

893
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:58,298
It isn't over.
There has to be a trial
in the interests of justice.

894
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:05,268
I'm here to help you.
No one's heard
your side of it, yet.

895
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:23,384
Your life is at stake.
Please, let me
do something for you.

896
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:32,333
Please, tell me
how it happened.

897
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:37,128
Please, let me help you.

898
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,219
I guess
that'll be all for today.

899
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:15,535
You know, you might
as well have stayed in
New York this weekend

900
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,579
for all the company
you've been.

901
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:21,013
I've never been
so conscious of my
monumental lack of knowledge.

902
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:26,020
Criminal law. Whatever
possessed an Anderson
to take up criminal law?

903
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,148
Probably his 50% Parker,
Grandma.

904
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,248
Probably.

905
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,589
You two
night owls still at it?

906
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:33,821
How did the meeting go, Dad?

907
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:37,127
Very promising. Joe thinks
we have enough pledges
to swing the nomination.

908
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,257
That's great!

909
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:41,200
I knew I would dance
at my son's inauguration ball.

910
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,398
Now, now,
it's all just straws in the
wind until the convention.

911
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:47,135
Many come but two are chosen.

912
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:51,805
Don't be negative.
I'm ordering my
inaugural gown in the morning.

913
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,447
Well, did you meet
the mysterious Madame X?

914
01:15:56,518 --> 01:16:01,114
Yeah. Dad,
she breaks your heart.

915
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:05,384
She's just
completely withdrawn,
waiting to die.

916
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,758
She doesn't even
want a defense.

917
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:11,257
Clay, I realize how
important your first case is,

918
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,801
but no one expects
you to win it, you know?

919
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:17,430
Maybe not,
but I've got to try.

920
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,871
You're the best lawyer I know.
What would you do?

921
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,969
How would you defend her?

922
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,611
Well, I'm only
a corporation lawyer, but it
seems to me that I remember

923
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:32,120
an old professor
of mine at Harvard.
He used to say that

924
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,985
a best defense
is a good offense.

925
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,818
Now, Sullivan's got a record
a mile long, hasn't he?

926
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:40,453
He sure has, grand larceny,
procuring, blackmail...

927
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,622
Try him on that record.

928
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:47,494
"Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, this poor
woman did not sin.

929
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:50,129
"She was sinned against."

930
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:52,264
Try Dan Sullivan
for his own murder?

931
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:53,672
Exactly.

932
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,838
Exactly.

933
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,605
The prosecution
on behalf of The People
of the State of New York

934
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:03,048
charges the defendant with
murder in the first degree,

935
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:06,178
and asks that the
penalty be fixed at death.

936
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,051
How does the defense plead?

937
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:13,193
The defense pleads
not guilty, Your Honor.

938

(CROWD CHATTERING)

939
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:17,891
(GAVEL POUNDING)

940
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:22,528
The defense will show that the
defendant was not responsible
at the time of the crime,

941
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:26,540
and that the
so-called confession was
obtained under duress.

942
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,867
Prosecution may
present its case.

943
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,136
Is this the gun?

944
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:34,810
It is.

945
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,807
Had the gun been discharged?

946
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,547
Yes. Three bullets
had been fired.

947
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:41,651
No further questions.

948
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,315
JUDGE: Cross-examine.

949
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,656
Did you speak to the defendant
when you found her?

950
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:48,457
Yes, I asked her name.
What was her answer?

951
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:49,929
She didn't answer.

952
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,397
Now, according to the
report you filed,

953
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:54,299
you addressed
several questions to her.
Did she answer any of them?

954
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:56,166
No.
Did she look at you

955
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,432
when you spoke to her?

956
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,371
No, she just sat there
and stared out.

957
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:02,433
In other words,
the defendant appeared
to be in a state of shock.

958
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:06,311
Objection, defense counsel
is asking the witness
for a medical opinion.

959
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:09,441
Well, Your Honor, I think
we can presume that a police
officer is experienced enough

960
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,849
to recognize a state of shock.

961
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,750
Objection overruled.

962
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:16,380
Did the defendant
appear to be
in a state of shock?

963
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,686
Yes, she did.

964
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:22,293
Now, will you tell the court
the defendant's words
when you entered the room?

965
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,731
She said, "Get the police.
I've killed a man."

966
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:28,360
Did you see the gun?

967
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,496
Yes, she was holding it.

968
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,739
Mr. Lopez,
did you see the defendant
kill Dan Sullivan?

969
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,174
Point the gun,
pull the trigger?

970
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,473
No, he was already dead.

971
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:41,311
Thank you.
No further questions.

972
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,481
Will you read the court
the criminal record
of Daniel M. Sullivan?

973
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,887
Objection. The record
of the deceased is irrelevant
and immaterial to this case.

974
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:51,118
Your Honor, the defense
respectfully contends

975
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:54,128
that the character
of the deceased had a
direct bearing on his death.

976
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:57,131
I'm going to allow
the witness the answer.

977
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,067
In 1954,
Sullivan served three months
for petty larceny.

978
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:07,302
In 1955, he was convicted
of extortion on charges
of a Mrs. Arthur Golden,

979
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,842
paid a $1,000 fine.

980
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:13,745
In 1957, Sullivan was
convicted of procuring and
served a year in state prison.

981
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:17,410
In 1960, three years
for violation of the
Federal Narcotics Law.

982
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:22,355
In 1963, a bench warrant
was issued for his arrest
on another extortion charge

983
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,916
by a Miss Frances Elliott,
age 63.

984
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,894
But he got across
the border to Mexico before
he could be apprehended.

985
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,593
Were there any
other blackmail charges
brought against Sullivan?

986
01:19:32,667 --> 01:19:35,500
Yes, four times
extortion charges were
brought, and dropped,

987
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,037
when the claimants
refused to sign.

988
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:41,166
Your Honor, I must
protest. If the charges
weren't substantiated,

989
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,106
surely they're not
admissible as evidence.

990
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:44,577
Your Honor,
victims of blackmail

991
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:46,375
are rarely willing
to sign complaints.

992
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,814
Objection sustained,
the answer is stricken.

993
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:51,682
The jury is instructed
not to consider the
last question and answer

994
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:53,482
in their deliberations.

995
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:59,288
Sergeant Riley,
based solely on convictions,
Daniel M. Sullivan's crimes

996
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:01,761
were mainly directed
against women, weren't they?

997
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:04,196
Yes.
No further questions.

998
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:07,991
Doctor, would you describe
absinthe to the court?

999
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:13,632
Absinthe is a green,
toxic liqueur,
between 70 and 80 proof,

1000
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,608
distilled from
wormwood and aromatics.

1001
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:18,168
Is absinthe procurable
in this country?

1002
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:19,679
Not legally.

1003
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:22,715
Well, is absinthe
legally procurable
anyplace in the world?

1004
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,910
Not to my knowledge.

1005
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,043
Why not?

1006
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,612
Well, absinthe
produces a degenerative
effect upon the system.

1007
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:31,523
It attacks the digestive
organs and nerve centers.

1008
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:36,755
It can induce
delirium and has been
known to destroy sanity.

1009
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,996
Doctor, is the defendant
addicted to absinthe?

1010
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:42,865
She is.

1011
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:44,900
No further questions.

1012
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,964
Cross-examine.

1013
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:48,839
Dr. Evans,

1014
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,242
did you examine the defendant
when she was arrested?

1015
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:52,507
Yes.

1016
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,674
Did you request a
psychiatric examination?

1017
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:56,148
I considered it.

1018
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:57,845
Did you request it?

1019
01:20:57,919 --> 01:20:59,819
No.
Then we must assume

1020
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:04,518
that you considered
the defendant legally sane.
No further questions.

1021
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:09,329
Dr. Evans, what does the term
"legally sane" mean?

1022
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,991
Well, that the
defendant understands
the nature of his act

1023
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:14,467
and its probable consequences.

1024
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:19,438
Well, would it be possible for
an individual to be legally
sane, but medically insane?

1025
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:21,168
Tragically so.

1026
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,335
Now, when you
allowed the defendant

1027
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,504
to face trial,
did you consider
her medically sane?

1028
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:30,279
Objection. The medical
sanity of the defendant
has no bearing on this case.

1029
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,520
(GAVEL POUNDING)

of New York plainly states...

JUDGE: Address your remarks
to the bench.

1031
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:40,219
But Your Honor,
the medical sanity
of the defendant

1032
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,160
is not the consideration
of this court.

1033
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,754
Overruled, Mr. Spalding.

1034
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,926
Did you consider the
defendant medically sane?

1035

No.
Thank you.

No.

Would you feel yourself
qualified to pass on
the sanity of the accused?

How is she?

an injection, but it's like

She can't endure much more.

something to fight with.

would you mind using
the main entrance?

the murder weapon,

1062

and you've heard the
defendant's admission of guilt
to the hotel employee,

and to Detective Combs,

1064

and you've seen the confession
signed by the defendant, "X."

I solemnly charge you,
do not be tricked
into sympathy for her.

01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:33,484
He'd have you
believe that the deed of
Madame X was justified

1070
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:36,291
because Dan Sullivan
was a disreputable man.

1071
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:40,698
Disreputable or not,
I would wish for Dan Sullivan

1072
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:47,069
what can never be his.
A fair and honest trial
before a jury of his peers.

1073
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:52,546
Madame "X" appointed herself
his judge and his executioner.

1074
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:57,074
Now, the defense attorney
comes before us on his
first case, young and eager,

1075
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,742
son of a brilliant
and famous father.

1076
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,618
And I'm sure
Governor Anderson is proud
of the resourceful fight

1077
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:04,522
that Clayton Anderson Junior
has waged in this court room.

1078
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:10,724
However, admiration
for the young man
or sympathy for his client

1079
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:12,129
must not sway you.

1080
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:17,297
I charge you to uphold the law
and to punish its violators.

1081
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:24,471
Madame "X" is a murderess.
She's taken a life.

1082
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:33,618
And on behalf of the people,
I must demand
her life in return.

1083
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:42,294
(GAVEL POUNDING)

1084
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:46,197
Mr. Anderson, are you
ready to make your
concluding statement?

1085
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,362
Wait. There's something
I want to say.

1086
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:52,397
You're out of order.

1087
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:55,874
If you wish to make
a statement, you must be
sworn in, and take the stand.

1088
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:56,968
Yes.

1089
01:26:57,045 --> 01:27:01,311
No, Madame, no. Your Honor,
may I have a recess
to talk with my client?

1090
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:04,309
It’ll be all right.
Don't worry.

1091
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,580
No, you're not prepared
as a witness.

1092
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:10,717
I know exactly
what I want to say.

1093
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,861
Raise your right hand.
Place your left hand
on the Bible.

1094
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:27,169
Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you are about
to give before this court

1095
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,575
is the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1096
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:32,636
I do.
Please be seated.

1097
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:49,224
Madam, do you want
to tell us what happened?

1098
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,161
Madam.

1099
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:08,510
You're a child, fighting alone
in a terrible darkness.

1100
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,482
I would have left this earth
without explanation,

1101
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:18,823
but you, you alone,
have made it impossible.

1102
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:25,160
Over and over
he begged me to tell what
happened, and I never did.

1103
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,266
I let him stand up here
in front of you without
a weapon in his hand.

1104
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:33,739
Life had long ceased
to have meaning for me.

1105
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:41,045
And I didn't think or care
what I was doing to him.

1106
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:47,549
Forgive me. Forgive me.

1107
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:51,992
I'm not dead, after all.

1108
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:58,624
The dead don't weep
or feel such pain.

1109
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:04,638
Child, don't fight any longer.

1110
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:08,606
I killed Dan Sullivan.

1111
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:14,076
He fished me
out of the sewers of Mexico.

1112
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:17,084
He bought me dirt cheap.

1113
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:21,852
A couple of aspirin,
a few bottles of whiskey,

1114
01:29:23,825 --> 01:29:25,656
and I killed him.

1115
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,524
Why did you kill him?

1116
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,593
He found out I once had a son,

1117
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:36,060
a family, respectable family,

1118
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,335
and a fine son.

1119
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,939
They thought I was dead
more than 20 years,

1120
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,612
and Sullivan was going to
tell my child that I was alive

1121
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:56,286
and what I'd become.

1122
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:03,428
I don't have much
to leave my son.

1123
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:10,968
Only a lie that his mother
was clean and good.

1124
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:13,870
Why did you leave your family?

1125
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:25,708
I wasn't suitable.
I really wasn't.

1126
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:31,387
I wonder why it took me
so long to see it?

1127
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:41,525
I killed Dan Sullivan
to keep my son
from knowing about me.

1128
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:46,572
I'm not sorry.

1129
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:53,407
And if time were turned back,
I'd kill him again.

1130
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:01,412
That's the truth, child.
The truth.

1131
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:18,696
These are the most
important words I may
ever have to say,

1132
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:24,000
and this is the most
important decision you
may ever have to make.

1133
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:28,240
I stand between
a woman and death,

1134
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:32,383
and you stand here with me.

1135
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:37,757
There was a speech
I was going to make,
but I can't make it now.

1136
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,826
Not after those simple,
heartbreaking words of hers.

1137
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:47,262
Mr. Spalding has cautioned
you not to try Dan Sullivan
for his own murder.

1138
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,530
Well, how can you
do otherwise?

1139
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:52,630
He'd be alive if it weren't
for his own evil greed.

1140
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:57,935
His sins finally
caught up with him,
and he reaped the whirlwind.

1141
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:04,818
The prosecution
accuses my client
of breaking the law of God,

1142
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:10,356
or did, before he
heard her story. Perhaps he
wouldn't charge that now.

1143
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:15,592
For does the lioness
lose favor with God when
she fights for her cubs?

1144
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:21,034
Does the mother bear,
who kills at the
mouth of the cave?

1145
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:26,037
In all creation is there
the female of the species

1146
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:30,806
who will not sacrifice
her own life to protect
the life she has conceived?

1147
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:37,245
Dark and terrible years
lie between this woman
and her son,

1148
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:40,644
but she protects him,
even now, with her life.

1149
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:46,319
Her son will never know
how deeply he is loved.

1150
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:52,826
She thinks he would be
ashamed of her.
I think he would kneel

1151
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:55,593
and hold her to his heart.

1152
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:05,008
The prosecution
asks for justice.

1153
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:11,845
I would remind him
and you of the towering
words of Sophocles.

1154
01:33:13,621 --> 01:33:17,580
"There is a point at which
even justice is unjust."

1155
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,588
Justice must be fair.

1156
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:28,560
It must be merciful.
It must be understanding.

1157
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:37,235
My client doesn't ask for her
life. She's ready to die,
knowing her son to be safe.

1158
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:42,145
I ask it.

1159
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,916
I give this woman's life
into your hands.

1160
01:33:49,223 --> 01:33:51,657
And I beg you
to return it to her.

1161
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:10,369
JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen,
you have heard the evidence.

1162
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:13,538
You will retire
to deliberate your verdict.

1163
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:22,478
(GASPS)

1164
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:23,952
Matron.

1165
01:34:33,634 --> 01:34:36,467
I must see her.
I can't tell you
how important it is.

1166
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:39,165
I'll see what I can do,
Governor.

1167
01:34:48,783 --> 01:34:50,478
I'm beyond reason.

1168
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:54,950
Holly drowned.
How can she still be alive?

1169
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:09,163
May we be alone?

1170
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:11,237
We'll wait outside.

1171
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:14,240
You must be very quiet.

1172
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:16,037
I know.

1173
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,889
We're going to win.
Don't worry.

1174
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:37,457
Did you do well in school?

1175
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,624
Middling well.

1176
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:42,225
Middling well.

1177
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:47,573
I haven't heard
that expression
since my father died.

1178
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:50,907
Where do you live?

1179
01:35:51,912 --> 01:35:53,311
In New York.

1180
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:55,976
Alone?

1181
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:57,848
(LAUGHS)

1182
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:59,886
In a one-room apartment.

1183
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:06,516
Let your son know
that you're alive.
Give him a chance to love you.

1184
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,755
Do you have a girl?

1185
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:13,094
Yes.

1186
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:15,465
We're going to be
married soon.

1187
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,667
You love her very much?

1188
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:20,900
Very much.

1189
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:26,074
The moments of love are
the only ones that matter.

1190
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:33,584
The moments of love
illuminate and are gone.

1191
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:37,514
Treasure them.

1192
01:36:38,425 --> 01:36:41,883
And when you're married,
live alone.

1193
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:45,898
It's so important
to live alone.

1194
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:51,694
And when you have a child,
get a little house.

1195
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:58,801
A red-frame house
on a friendly street

1196
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:05,016
with good neighbors
and lots of children.

1197
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,750
Did you have a house
like that?

1198
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:11,250
Almost.

1199
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:19,399
I was once almost
a rich, rich woman.

1200
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:22,829
Please let me call your son.

1201
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:25,930
No.

1202
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:29,968
But if I were your son,
I'd want to know.

1203
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:34,007
Don't make decisions for him.

1204
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:40,216
It's the only prerogative
of motherhood I still possess.

1205
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:46,749
He's free of my sins.

1206
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:51,988
Your son should be here.

1207
01:37:55,002 --> 01:37:56,435
You're here.

1208
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:58,064
Yes.

1209
01:38:11,752 --> 01:38:16,348
Today, I've had a son.

1210
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,859
And, oh, what a joy.

1211
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:34,105
Dr. Evans! Dr. Evans!

1212
01:38:58,365 --> 01:39:02,062
The jury is ready
to come back.
You'll be needed in there.

1213
01:39:04,138 --> 01:39:09,075
You're going to win
this case, Son. I'm sure
you're going to win it.

1214
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:11,133
It doesn't matter now.

1215
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:15,238
Yes, it does.
More than you'll ever realize.

1216
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:24,287
I don't know why,
but I loved her. From the
moment I saw her, I loved her.

1217
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,752
I know.

1218
