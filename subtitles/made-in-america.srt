00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,582
Whoa!

3
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,095
Hi.
Hi.

4
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,110
Hey, morning,
Sarah.

5
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,617
Watch it, lady!

6
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,634
Hi, sarah.

7
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,635
How you doing?

8
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,643
Slow down!

9
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,683
Morning.

10
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,685
You're getting crumbs
on my counter.

11
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,186
What will be will be.

12
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,188
Can i get a
little space here?

13
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,189
Oh, excuse us!

14
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,690
Well, get out
of the way.

15
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,192
Oh, for me? thank you!

16
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,694
No, not for you.
Thank you.

17
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,696
Do we have to listen

18
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,698
To this horrible
jungle music?

19
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,699
Do you have to work here?

20
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,200
Is somebody
twisting your arm?

21
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,701
Yes. you are.
It would be bad luck

22
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,703
If at least one day a week,

23
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,704
You didn't have
a real african queen

24
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,206
Working on the premises.

25
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,708
Stop humping at me.
Don't do it again.

26
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,711
I still say i should
wear the crown.

27
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,713
I'm gonna slap the sh--

28
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,715
Welcome to the african queen.

29
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,716
Come right in, ladies.
Right this way.

30
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,717
Thank you.

31
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,718
Ooh, I love this.

32
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,186
Thank you.

33
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,555
Ok, listen up.

34
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,558
I Want you to open your books
to page 602--

35
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:19,558
You're gonna find
an illustration

36
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,560
On blood and the vascular--

37
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,062
Reuben, enough
with the graffiti.

38
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,563
Into the biology, huh?

39
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,075
Give me your finger.

40
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,077
Whoa! Quit grabbing me, girl.

41
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,078
Just give me your finger!

42
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,082
Uhhh. uhhh.

43
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,586
Aah!

44
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,088
Aah! You cut me!

45
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,591
Keep it down, gang.

46
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,593
Something funny?

47
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,595
The cap and gown fitting is on the 4th.

48
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,096
Aw, your mothers.

49
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,098
Mr. jackson wants everyone
to know how pleased he is

50
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,100
With the turnout for
the condom demonstration.

51
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,102
And dispersal.

52
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,103
Go figure.

53
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,104
I'm type o.

54
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,110
Stop, silly.

55
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,611
When you're finished
with your blood type,

56
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,113
Turn to page 158
in the text.

57
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,115
You are, da dow...

58
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,116
AB.

59
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,118
Let's do it again.

60
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,120
Why?

61
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,121
Something's wrong.

62
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,122
What?

63
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,632
I'm AB.

64
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,139
Zora?

65
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,642
Zora, what's the matter?

66
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,645
Zora!

67
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,152
Is that good?

68
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,153
Ok.

69
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,655
I'm gonna--

70
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,657
Mom!

71
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,658
What are you doing
out of school?

72
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,659
You lied to me.

73
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,660
What are you
talking about?

74
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,663
Before dad died,
you had an affair.

75
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,164
You slept with someone else.

76
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,665
Thank god this happened
on one of my work days.

77
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,667
Shut up.

78
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,669
Your blood type is A,
Charlie's was O,

79
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,138
And I just came out AB.

80
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,640
Ma, that is not
genetically possible.

81
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,643
Look, why don't we
go somewhere

82
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,145
And talk
about this quietly?

83
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,646
Come on, ok?

84
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,647
Ohh!

85
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,649
Oh. Excuse me.

86
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,150
Take care of this.

87
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,153
Wait. you don't
have to go anywhere.

88
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,655
Ma, it was
a sperm bank.

89
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,656
That's undignified.

90
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,659
Well, maybe to some people,

91
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,664
But, hey, I'd just lost
the biggest love of my life.

92
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,666
I thought maybe I could
Make myself another.

93
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,168
Sit down.

94
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,671
And I did,
and I got you.

95
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,177
I never wanted you
to find out like this.

96
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,179
I really wanted to
tell you before this.

97
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,182
It's just...
I was chicken.

98
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,184
And I'm sorry,

99
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,686
'cause this was not the right way

100
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,687
for you to find out.

101
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,190
It's ok.

102
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,193
You sure?

103
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,694
It's ok.

104
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,195
Ok.

105
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,704
You have no idea
who the guy was?

106
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,706
No.

107
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,709
The door opened,
the tray came in,

108
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,210
He was this tall,
Ok?

109
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,211
Ma!

110
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,713
What? It was
in a little vial.

111
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,215
I didn't know
what to say.

112
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,216
It didn't speak.

113
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,217
How could I know
who it was?

114
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,718
I didn't care.

115
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,220
I asked for the best
they had--

116
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,723
Black, smart,
not too tall...

117
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,725
All the things
you are.

118
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,726
And look
what they made.

119
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,728
They made magic.
They made you.

120
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,732
So you bought sperm.

121
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,736
Yes! Yes!
I Bought the sperm.

122
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,237
Uhh! Uhh!

123
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,240
How much did it cost?
Why?

124
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,742
I just want to know.

125
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:57,743
Are you going to
buy some?

126
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:58,744
No.

127
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,747
It doesn't matter.
Come on.

128
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,748
Would it make
you feel better

129
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,749
If i said
it was free--

130
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,250
Somebody handed it
to me on the street

131
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,752
And I used it
at home?

132
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,753
It doesn't matter.

133
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,255
But, ma, I could
have a father.

134
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,760
Let me tell
you something.

135
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,262
You had a father, and
his name was Charlie,

136
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,266
And... he was the best.

137
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,768
He was great.

138
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,770
Life is great.

139
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,272
Ok?

140
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,774
Ok.

141
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,276
Ok.
Ok.

142
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,280
Ok!

143
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,281
Ok.

144
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,151
Are you sure you
even want to bother?

145
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,653
They can be real assholes
sometimes.

146
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,157
You don't have to do this.
I'm prepared to go alone.

147
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,658
No, that ain't it.

148
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,161
Besides, I might get a chance
to meet my future father-in-law.

149
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,662
Tea cake, please.

150
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,665
What? You the one that said
you wanted to marry me.

151
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,666
Yeah, but I was 7!

152
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,169
Yeah, well,
you was a mature 7.

153
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,671
Just be my friend, Tea.
Boyfriends come and go.

154
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,675
Baby, I'll come and go.
Where do we start?

155
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,676
You nasty.

156
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,677
Yeah. You better
take advantage of this.

157
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,178
I might not live
down the street

158
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,179
For the rest of your life.

159
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,682
Take the first exit
off the bridge.

160
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,685
Left. make a left
at the light.

161
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,687
At some point
you have to tell me

162
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:15,687
Where we going.

163
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,189
I don't wanna be
following you around

164
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,190
Like some
honeydew sucker.

165
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,692
Why not? You been
doing it for years.

166
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,695
Are the rules
suddenly changing?

167
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,197
Look, just tell me what
the sign on the building

168
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,198
is gonna say.

169
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,700
California cryobank.

170
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,701
What kind of
bank is that?

171
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,702
It's a sperm bank.

172
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,203
That's it.
I'm making a u-turn.

173
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,205
No, wait.
It's right there, Tea.

174
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,707
For 17 years,
I thought he was dead.

175
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,710
But it's not true.
I have a father.

176
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,213
So you think you're
gonna walk in here and say,

177
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,714
"Oh, excuse me,
17 years ago"

178
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,216
"A man came in
to make a deposit."

179
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,218
"He looked like me, maybe?"

180
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,219
Be quiet.

181
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,721
"Anyway, could you give me
his name and number,"

182
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,723
"'cause he's my daddy."

183
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,725
Honeydew,
shut up.

184
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,727
Can I help you?

185
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,729
Yes. I have a friend here

186
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,730
Who's interested
in donating.

187
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,732
No, you don't!

188
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,234
He's a little shy.

189
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,237
Surely. for today, he needs
to fill out the forms

190
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,739
And leave blood
and sperm samples.

191
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,243
Only 15 % of applicants
end up becoming donors.

192
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,744
If he qualifies,

193
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,247
He will be paid
$40 per donation,

194
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,250
With no more than 3 deposits
allowed per week.

195
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,251
Hmm.

196
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,752
Thank you.

197
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,257
Hey, hey, come on.

198
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,259
I Can't just
go in there

199
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,760
And wrestle with the
bald-headed champ.

200
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,262
What's the big deal?

201
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,766
It's not like you've
never done it before.

202
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,267
That's my business.

203
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:36,769
Are you ready?

204
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,772
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm, mm-mmm.

205
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,280
We have magazines

206
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,784
As well as videotapes.

207
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,788
Which would you prefer?

208
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,293
Um, the--
The videotapes, please.

209
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,315
This way, please.

210
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,324
He'll have to do
the rest alone.

211
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,326
Oh, I just need
to use the bathroom.

212
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,328
Second door
on the right.

213
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,329
Thanks.

214
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,334
Mommy.

215
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,339
Come on, man!

216
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,353
Oh, yeah,
now we're talking!

217
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,854
Sorry.

218
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,857
No creams or lotions.
they get into the sample.

219
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,359
Please don't grab the sink
during collection.

220
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,361
One man ripped it
off the wall.

221
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,863
We pay by volume.

222
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,367
You must reach the top line
even to be considered.

223
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,368
Damn!

224
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,371
Any questions?

225
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,875
Well, yeah. I was--

226
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,379
How am I supposed
to fill this up?

227
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,880
I can't fill it.

228
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,801
Good motility.

229
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,302
Yeah, it's very good.

230
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,305
Count's up
from last time.

231
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,823
I ain't doing it.

232
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,835
Is somebody in there?!

233
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:15,343
Oh, it feels so good.

234
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:16,345
Ohh!

235
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:18,847
Oh, God!

236
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,849
Ohh!

237
00:13:39,868 --> 00:13:41,369
Oh, this key!

238
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:45,374
What are you doing here?

239
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:46,875
I thought this
was the bathroom.

240
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,377
I'm calling security.

241
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:49,878
I didn't do anything!

242
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,382
Nurse,
I need another cup.

243
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:56,385
Zora!

244
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:57,386
Where you going?

245
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,805
I found my father.

246
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:09,982
Heaven.

247
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:10,983
Hea--

248
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:11,984
Ha ha ha.

249
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,985
Oh!

250
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,987
Up I go. Down I go.

251
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,990
Up I go. Down I go.

252
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,491
Up I go. down...

253
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,493
Oh, God.

254
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,499
They're getting whiter.

255
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,502
They're getting whiter!

256
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,504
You should bleach
your teeth!

257
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,507
I swear it's so cool!

258
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,509
Oh, yeah. good idea, sweetheart.

259
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,036
Ooh.

260
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,538
Rise and shine, Mr. bunny-butt.

261
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,539
Hmm?

262
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,542
Oh. Wait a minute, honey.
There you go.

263
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,551
Hello. i'm dressed.
I'm leaving.

264
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,053
Kiss good-bye.

265
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,057
Ok. that's enough.
Step class in 20 minutes.

266
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,058
Bye.

267
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,078
Ooh. Very young.

268
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,580
Very cute.

269
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,586
Hello, there.
Can I help you?

270
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,088
Hi. I'm looking for a Hal Jackson.

271
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,590
Well, look no further.

272
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,091
Is he inside?

273
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,593
You're talking to him.

274
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,095
To Halbert Jackson?

275
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,598
The one and only.

276
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,099
You're white.

277
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,601
Well, that's true, darlin'.

278
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,603
But when we're alone in the dark,

279
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,105
What difference is that gonna make?

280
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,610
No, see, I'm looking
for the Halbert Jackson

281
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,615
Whose social security
number is 540-82-9789.

282
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,617
Are you a process server?

283
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,618
What's that?

284
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,619
Did my ex-wife send you?

285
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,622
God damn it! We settled
all that alimony shit!

286
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,124
No more legal crap.
She agreed.

287
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,626
No, wait! Wait!

288
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:39,130
I'm sorry, but I don't know
anything about your ex-wife.

289
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,633
Oh. Hell, I'm late.
Don't get me wrong.

290
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,634
I think we're good together.

291
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,636
We got a thing, a connection,

292
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,137
But I gotta go,

293
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,139
So if you want to keep talking,

294
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,640
Why don't you hop on in here?

295
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,147
Make up your mind.
I got to get to work.

296
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,648
Coming or going?

297
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,652
Well, that's a shame.

298
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,153
No!

299
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,656
Aw, there you go.
All right.

300
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,676
Where do you work?

301
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:25,677
Jackson motors.

302
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,178
"Because real cowboys

303
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,680
"Are strong and tough.

304
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,181
"So are american trucks.

305
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,683
"And don't forget...

306
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,685
Hal's your pal."

307
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,687
What'd you say
your name was again?

308
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,189
Uh, Zora.

309
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,691
Zora Mathews.

310
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,693
Are you the young lady

311
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,695
That Daryl's been telling us about?

312
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,198
I don't think anyone's told you about me.

313
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,294
Hey, Diego!
Front and center!

314
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:00,295
Oh, my.

315
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:04,299
Lady over there laughing at the ground.

316
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,300
Ah, women.

317
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,801
Gotta love 'em.

318
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:09,304
You're late.

319
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:11,306
Well, of course
I'm late, Teddy.

320
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,308
Hello there, folks.
How y'all doing?

321
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:14,809
Jesus Christ.
A bear?

322
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,811
You said llama.

323
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:17,312
I may have mentioned llama.

324
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,314
Bears are really big right now.

325
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:20,815
Boris is getting restless, Ted.

326
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,317
You better go put on your suit.

327
00:18:22,317 --> 00:18:23,818
Now, this is bullshit.

328
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:24,820
We're done with circus.

329
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,821
You promised me barnyard--

330
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:27,322
chicken, geese, cows, beavers.

331
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:28,824
Who is this guy?

332
00:18:28,824 --> 00:18:31,326
He's the trainer.
You liked the zebra.

333
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:32,827
Hell I liked the zebra.

334
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,329
You loved the chimp.
Remember? Little Larry?

335
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:35,830
Larry? Yeah,
I liked Larry.

336
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,332
Couldn't drive worth shit,
but i liked him.

337
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:38,833
The bear's got to work now.

338
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:39,835
He hasn't eaten yet.

339
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:40,836
What the hell happened to--

340
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:41,837
Nothing.

341
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:42,838
The light's total shit!

342
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,339
Now, we had a 7:00 call!

343
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,341
We've been waiting for hours.

344
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:47,342
Why are we using this asshole?

345
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:48,843
I told you I never
wanted to see him again.

346
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,345
We're shooting
a truck commercial.

347
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:52,347
He thinks it's
<i>gone with the goddamn wind!</i>

348
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,348
What the hell's that supposed to mean,

349
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:54,349
"The bear hasn't eaten yet"?

350
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:55,350
Hey, Jose!

351
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,351
Morning, chief.

352
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:57,352
It's technical.

353
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:58,853
Technical, my ass.
Hello there, Bobby!

354
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:00,355
Don't give them away.

355
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:01,856
Oh! Red light!

356
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,359
Hey, how you doing?
You look beautiful.

357
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,861
Green light. Selling cars is what you do,

358
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:07,863
And advertising is what I do.

359
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,364
Will you put on the suit?

360
00:19:09,364 --> 00:19:11,366
The bear's on the clock.
You're killing me.

361
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:15,871
Hi. Listen, we're getting
40 new trucks in an hour.

362
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:17,873
Laura's going for take-out.
What do you want?

363
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:21,877
Uh, 3 packs of marlboros
and some cheese. yeah.

364
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:22,878
Some cheese.

365
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:28,383
You ok?

366
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,384
Much better.

367
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:32,887
Are you the girl Daryl
was telling us about?

368
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,890
Nah, you couldn't be her.

369
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,395
Thank you.

370
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:41,896
Uh-huh.

371
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:43,398
He's done this before, right?

372
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,899
Stand back, now.

373
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:49,904
Ok.

374
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,410
I look like my mother.

375
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:03,919
Uh-oh.

376
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,421
Oh, look at that.

377
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:07,922
Shit.

378
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:09,424
Get! Come on.

379
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:10,925
God damn it!

380
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:13,929
Oh, God!

381
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:17,933
What the hell is this?

382
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:18,934
Ohh!

383
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,439
I need to talk to you.

384
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,940
Oh. Hey, you think you
can help me with this?

385
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:27,442
It kind of got stuck.

386
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:29,944
Just hold onto this.
When I say go, you pull.

387
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,446
All right. Go.

388
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,448
You've got Detroit on line 4.

389
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:34,949
Oh, my God.

390
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,451
I'll call back later.

391
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,952
That must be the girl Daryl's
been telling us about.

392
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,955
Oh, hell.
Look at that.

393
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:41,456
Uh, listen, Zorro,

394
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:43,458
I think you're sweet
and everything--

395
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,960
It's <i>Zora.</i>

396
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,461
Zora. whatever.
But, uh...

397
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,962
I'm not really into this
whole black-white thing,

398
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:49,965
And right now,
I got a commercial to shoot.

399
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,466
But, hey, let's stay in touch.
Ciao.

400
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:52,968
I need to talk to you!

401
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:55,470
It's really important!
Will you just listen?

402
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,971
I'll listen to you.

403
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:57,973
Does this make us ready?

404
00:20:57,973 --> 00:20:58,974
Yes. we're ready.

405
00:20:58,974 --> 00:20:59,975
What, he's wearing this?

406
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:00,976
He looks great.

407
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:02,477
What the hell is this?

408
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:03,478
Oh, here. Hold that.

409
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:04,979
Ready to run a rehearsal, everybody!

410
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,481
Boris should meet Hal.

411
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:07,482
Hal, you got to meet the bear.

412
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:08,483
All right, I'll meet the bear.

413
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:10,485
Hello, Bear.
I'm Hal Jackson.

414
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:11,986
Whoa!
Jesus lord!

415
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:14,956
Whoa!

416
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:15,957
Down, Boris.

417
00:21:15,957 --> 00:21:17,458
Good boy, Boris.

418
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,960
Now pay attention.

419
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:21,463
You're gonna walk him
past the row of trucks

420
00:21:21,463 --> 00:21:22,964
With this chain.

421
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:26,467
Remember, keep your eyes
forward at all times.

422
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:27,969
Let me work the bear.

423
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,971
Uh-oh.

424
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:32,974
Eyes forward.
Good boy, good boy.

425
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:33,975
Down, Boris.

426
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:34,976
Down, Boris.

427
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:37,479
Eyes forward.

428
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:40,482
Do not touch the bear
on the back of the head,

429
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:42,483
And no whistling whatsoever.

430
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,486
If you have to sneeze,
raise your hand.

431
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,488
Make a signal to me,
and I'll protect you.

432
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:48,990
No sudden moves.

433
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:51,493
Down, Boris.

434
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:53,995
Eyes forward at all times.

435
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:56,497
No sudden moves.

436
00:21:56,998 --> 00:22:00,001
Eyes forward. no sneezing.
No whistling.

437
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,003
Boris is the only working
male bear in the country

438
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,005
With a full set
of teeth and claws.

439
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,006
Teddy!

440
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:08,009
What? Oh.
It's gonna look great.

441
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,011
Let's shoot the rehearsal
Just in case.

442
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:12,013
Shooting the rehearsal, people!

443
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:14,732
Is that big enough?
Can you read that?

444
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,634
Fine. he's ready!

445
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,521
Do it!

446
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:20,522
This is--

447
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:21,523
No, no! Cut, cut!

448
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:23,024
You see that wire?

449
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:24,025
It's hot.

450
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,027
It keeps Boris back.

451
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:27,028
Uh-huh.

452
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,531
This is Hal Jackson
from Jackson motors

453
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:31,032
Asking you to bear in mind

454
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:33,534
There's a reason so many
Of us come down here--

455
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:35,036
I have to talk to you!

456
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:36,537
Not now, Teddy.

457
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,039
I need a flag set.

458
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,540
Teddy, handle this.

459
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,042
Do you hear me? No!

460
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,544
I have to tell you this myself!

461
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:46,548
I need to have this
conversation with you!

462
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:48,049
I need to tell you something!

463
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,552
Tell me, then.
Just say it, damn it.

464
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:52,053
You're driving me crazy.

465
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:54,556
You're my father.

466
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:55,557
What?

467
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,062
Jesus, give me some room!

468
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:05,066
This is great!
This is great!

469
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,567
Shoot it! Shoot it!

470
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:09,070
Get it! Get it!

471
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,071
Harlan?

472
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:11,072
Mother!

473
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:14,075
Me, me, me, me!

474
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,077
Wonderful. Keep rolling.

475
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,578
Please call 911!

476
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:18,580
Nice bear!

477
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,583
That bear has never
done that before.

478
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,085
'cept that once.

479
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:26,087
Somebody, help me!
Please!

480
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,091
Piece of shit car.

481
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:31,592
Where's the guy with one arm?

482
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:33,094
Nice bear.

483
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,055
Teddy!

484
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,057
I'm here for you, babe.

485
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:47,558
It looks fabulous!

486
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,060
Cut! That's a wrap, people.

487
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,564
This is bullshit.

488
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,566
I mean, you're black.
I'm white.

489
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,568
This is bullshit.

490
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,571
I can't believe it either.

491
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,072
This whole thing is horrible.

492
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,074
I've always been sort of light,

493
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,075
But, God, not this!

494
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,578
Well, there you go.
It's a mistake.

495
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,080
Oh--ow!
Hell, look at that.

496
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,081
Shoot!

497
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,083
So you never donated any sperm?

498
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,085
I didn't say that,
but for God's sake,

499
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,087
It was my understanding
the whole thing was anonymous.

500
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,089
Otherwise, I sure as hell
wouldn't have done it.

501
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,090
It was anonymous.

502
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,092
I--I just found the records.

503
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,593
What the hell's that supposed to mean--

504
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,095
You found the records?

505
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,098
I took the records from the computer.

506
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,599
Well, God damn it!

507
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,602
Don't you have any respect for privacy?

508
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,603
Can I help you?

509
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,604
No.

510
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,606
Go on, shoo!

511
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:35,607
Don't you think a person has the right

512
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,608
to know who her parents are?

513
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,109
No! No, I don't.

514
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,610
Besides, you got no real proof.

515
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,113
Stolen medical files
ain't a hill of beans

516
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,114
In my book.

517
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,118
Will you excuse me?
Thank you, darlin'.

518
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,619
We could take blood tests
and find out.

519
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,622
You're missin'
the whole point.

520
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,124
Look, suppose I am your...

521
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,127
Suppose I'm the, uh...

522
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:59,130
Suppose we knew that I was
the contributing party.

523
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,132
Why are you telling me this?

524
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:04,135
You need a spare kidney
or some bone marrow?

525
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,636
For Christ's sake,

526
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,639
It was conception
in a plastic cup.

527
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:14,646
Look, you seem well-adjusted,
like a good kid.

528
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,648
I ain't got nothing
to offer you,

529
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,650
Except maybe a deal
on a new truck

530
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,651
Or extended warranty
and financing.

531
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,152
Otherwise,
I'm sorry.

532
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,660
Yeah, right.

533
00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:41,722
Hey, Sarah.

534
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:43,224
Hey, there.

535
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:50,231
Lucy, I'm home!

536
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:55,236
These earrings are
a form of torture.

537
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,743
Ok, what's going on?

538
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:05,246
I'm just making dinner.

539
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:08,749
Just making dinner, huh?

540
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,252
I just wanted to make sure
that you knew

541
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:13,254
That even though we fight,

542
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,256
I think you're
a great mom.

543
00:26:16,758 --> 00:26:18,760
This is major.

544
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:29,770
Ooh! I hate
when you do that.

545
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:30,772
I'm sorry.

546
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:31,773
Ok.

547
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,779
I'm up.

548
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,781
All right, all right...

549
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:42,283
How many guesses do I get?

550
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:45,787
All right...

551
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:47,288
Did James fall asleep

552
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:48,789
Listening to that
Judy Garland tape

553
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,792
And burn down the bookstore?

554
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,294
All right.

555
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:56,798
You didn't get
accepted to M.I.T.?

556
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:01,802
Are you pregnant?

557
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:04,805
Listen, stop.
Stop this.

558
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:06,307
Stop for one second.

559
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:07,808
Tell me what's going on.

560
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:10,311
Ma, I found
my real father today.

561
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:12,313
He's a mean asshole.

562
00:27:12,313 --> 00:27:13,314
What?

563
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:15,816
I found my father!

564
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:18,319
Wait a minute. Wait.

565
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,321
What does that mean,
you found your father?

566
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:21,822
I went to the sperm bank,

567
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:23,825
Got your file from the computer,

568
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,326
And he's my father.

569
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:26,827
Ma, it was terrible!

570
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:28,329
Are you crazy?

571
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:29,330
I'm sorry!

572
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,331
What did you do?

573
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:31,332
I'm sorry!

574
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:33,334
Ok. o--I'm sorry.

575
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:34,835
Ok, come here.
Come here.

576
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:35,837
It's ok. It's ok.

577
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:37,839
It's ok. Mommy's here.

578
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,841
It's ok. It's ok.

579
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:41,342
It's all right.

580
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:45,846
Um, ma?

581
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,351
You haven't heard the worst part.

582
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:51,852
What?

583
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:53,354
He's, um...

584
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:55,856
He's--he's a...

585
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:57,358
Car salesman.

586
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:59,360
Car salesman?

587
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,861
Yeah.

588
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:04,866
And, ma, you're not gonna
believe this, but, um...

589
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:07,368
He's a white car salesman.

590
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,873
Wait. What do you mean, white?

591
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:13,875
He's like--like white-white?

592
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,877
White-white-white.

593
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,879
You mean he's like

594
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,881
A creamy eggshell kind of tan.

595
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:21,883
No. Like white.

596
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:23,884
Like totally white.
Like a white guy.

597
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:25,886
No. you mean that
he was so light

598
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:27,888
You thought he was
a white guy.

599
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:30,391
He's so light, ma,
He <i>is</i> a white guy.

600
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:32,393
What do you mean, he's white?

601
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:34,395
I didn't ask--
I didn't want no white--

602
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,397
What is he doing being white?

603
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:37,898
I didn't ask for a white man!

604
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,400
I distinctly asked for a black man!

605
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:41,903
Did you see the guy?
Was the guy black?

606
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:44,906
Didn't I tell you
the man came in a tube?!

607
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:45,907
I couldn't see anything!

608
00:28:45,907 --> 00:28:47,408
Well, you should've
asked to see him!

609
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:49,910
So kill me!
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

610
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,412
No, don't kill me.

611
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:52,913
I'll kill myself.
How's that?

612
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,415
What do you mean,
he's white?

613
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:57,918
I can't--wait. Forget it.
It doesn't matter.

614
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,920
Ok.

615
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,921
It's no big deal.

616
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,923
Hell, your hair's always been fine.

617
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:02,924
So what?

618
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:04,926
You're a little bit
lighter than me. Big deal!

619
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,928
Right. I mean,
look at Lacie and Rissa.

620
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:07,929
They're both really light,

621
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:09,430
And both of their parents
are really dark.

622
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,931
They're my complexion.

623
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,433
And look at those kids
on <i>the cosby show.</i>

624
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:13,934
Oh, please.
Let's not get into that.

625
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:14,936
You know they're mixed, right?

626
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:16,437
Well, of course they're mixed!

627
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:18,439
Ok. Well, then, we can
never really tell.

628
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:19,940
Who's gonna tell?
Who cares?

629
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:21,442
Are you gonna tell somebody?
No!

630
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:23,444
I won't tell, so let's eat!

631
00:29:23,444 --> 00:29:24,445
Ok.

632
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:25,446
Ok!

633
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:26,447
Ok.

634
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:28,950
Ma, it's even worse.

635
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,451
Oh, please!
What?

636
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:32,453
It's Hal Jackson.

637
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:33,954
Who?

638
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,456
Hal Jackson.

639
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:37,458
"Because real cowboys
are strong and tough,

640
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,960
And so are
American trucks."

641
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:42,463
You mean the schmuck
on the television

642
00:29:42,463 --> 00:29:43,964
With all the animals?
"Hal's your pal"?

643
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:45,967
That's my dad.

644
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:49,970
This is Hal Jackson
from Jackson motors,

645
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:51,472
And this is Larry.

646
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:52,473
Larry and I

647
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:54,475
Just saw Thelma and Louise
together,

648
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,477
And we figure if those
2 gals can see America,

649
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:58,479
Then, hell, it's high time
we did, too.

650
00:29:58,479 --> 00:29:59,480
The old-fashioned way--

651
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,482
Behind the wheel
of a top-of-the-line

652
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:02,983
American vehicle.

653
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,986
Sit down there, Larry,
and grab the wheel.

654
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:05,986
Here, turn around
and grab the wheel.

655
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:07,488
There you go.
You're driving there, son.

656
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:09,991
So come on down
to Jackson motors

657
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,492
And see the specials
we got goin'

658
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:12,493
On cars and trucks.

659
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:13,994
Could change your life.

660
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:16,497
I know Larry's
gonna change mine.

661
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:17,998
Larry's my pal.

662
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,001
Don't forget--
Hal's your pal.

663
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:22,503
Well, give me 5 here, Larry!

664
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:24,004
All right!
Grab your pistola

665
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,007
And let's go.

666
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,009
Adios, folks. Go on.
Pick your nose later.

667
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,510
Grab the wheel.
Let's do some drivin'.

668
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:33,514
Idiot.

669
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:53,534
Oh, Lord.

670
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,538
Stupid bear.

671
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,044
You are beautiful
because you are you--

672
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:05,046
Unique and individual--

673
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:07,048
But maybe
you don't believe this

674
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:09,050
Because your beauty
can't completely be seen.

675
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,051
Oh, Lord.

676
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:12,553
Maybe you have unwanted extra weight.

677
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,555
Maybe bad skin.

678
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:16,056
Maybe poor posture.

679
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,558
Maybe facial hair.

680
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:20,060
Close your eyes right now

681
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:22,563
And visualize these
negatives disappearing.

682
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:26,567
See the new
more beautiful you emerging.

683
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,076
Good morning.

684
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:37,077
I need to speak to somebody

685
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:38,579
In your records department.

686
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,082
We're looking for
books on weddings.

687
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,583
Her daughter Cindy's
getting married.

688
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:43,584
Finally!

689
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,087
Well, that's nice,
but I only carry books

690
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:47,588
With traditional
African ceremonies.

691
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:49,590
Well, that's a start, I guess.

692
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:51,092
Yes, um, look...

693
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:54,095
17 years ago,
I purchased some...

694
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:55,596
Some, uh...

695
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,099
We can't find
the wedding books.

696
00:31:58,099 --> 00:32:00,101
Over by the voodoo dolls.

697
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:02,103
Oh!
Oh!

698
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:04,105
Sperm.
I bought sperm.

699
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:06,106
I asked for
an African-American.

700
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:07,108
I don't think that's what I got.

701
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:08,609
I filled out all of these forms.

702
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:10,110
Nobody seems to be able
to tell me--

703
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,112
Are the books in order

704
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:12,113
Of subject matter or author?

705
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:13,114
Author.

706
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:14,615
Who's the author
of the wedding book?

707
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:16,617
Babe, I'm on the phone here.

708
00:32:16,617 --> 00:32:18,118
I don't know.

709
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,121
My life is hanging in the balance,

710
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:21,622
And you want talk to me about authors.

711
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:23,124
Would you just do your thing?

712
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:24,125
What thing?

713
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:27,128
I just don't think
I got what I paid for.

714
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,630
Why do all complaints
have to come in writing?

715
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,132
It's obvious to me
you people can't read.

716
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:33,634
Do the
"Urban bush woman"

717
00:32:33,634 --> 00:32:34,635
T-Shirts come in petite?

718
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:36,637
What exactly is
an urban bush woman?

719
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,640
Me! Me!
I'm an urban bush woman!

720
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,641
I'm an urban bush woman!

721
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:41,642
Oh.

722
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:43,644
This is not a mix-up.

723
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:45,145
A mix-up is when you
order a hamburger

724
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:46,147
And get a cheeseburger

725
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,648
Or when you bring your
clothes to the dry cleaner,

726
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:49,149
And they give you
somebody else's clothes.

727
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,652
What I'm talking about is
a major mistake in my life!

728
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:52,653
I hate it

729
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:53,654
When dry cleaners make mistakes.

730
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:55,155
Oh, and they say

731
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,157
The chemicals in dry cleaning

732
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:57,658
Are very bad for you.

733
00:32:57,658 --> 00:32:58,659
I know.

734
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,661
Who are you people?
Shut up!

735
00:33:00,661 --> 00:33:02,663
Get away from my counter.
I'm busy!

736
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:04,665
Go over there until I
finish this conversation,

737
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:06,166
And then I will help you!

738
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,668
Well, all right!

739
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:10,170
Now, listen, all you
have to do is--

740
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:11,172
Hello?

741
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:13,173
Hello?

742
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:14,175
Damn it.

743
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,163
I guess that explains

744
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,166
Why you like that
surfin' music shit.

745
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,169
That is not funny, Tea.

746
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,172
That's messed up--
a white dude.

747
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,174
I should've never told you.

748
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,675
No, that's cool.

749
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,677
Didn't dude say he'd get
you a deal on a truck?

750
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,179
Yeah, right.
That's amazing, huh?

751
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,649
Yeah. I mean, there's
a crazy difference

752
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,068
Between factory sticker
and what they charge you.

753
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:16,070
Big deal, Tea.

754
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:17,572
It is a big deal.
Come on.

755
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:18,572
You know my parents

756
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:20,074
Are getting me a car
for graduation.

757
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:23,578
I'm taking you down there
just to show you the place,

758
00:34:24,078 --> 00:34:25,579
Not to get you
a deal on a car,

759
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,582
So get over it, all right?

760
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,083
You're just mad 'cause you're
white.

761
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:31,085
Shut up.
"Shut up."

762
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:35,589
We're gonna crash.

763
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,881
How many trucks sold this morning?

764
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:45,883
Aw, come on, folks.

765
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,886
First rule of sales--
enthusiasm.

766
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,390
Mornin', darlin'.

767
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,892
Look at this.

768
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,894
Toyota lowered prices.

769
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,396
All right. How much?

770
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,398
5 % across the board.

771
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,900
Well, hell, that
makes me feel great!

772
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,401
Didn't make any
of us feel great.

773
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,904
That's because you're missin'
the big picture, Jose.

774
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,405
They had to lower prices.

775
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,408
We got ourselves a better product.

776
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,409
All you need

777
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,410
Is conviction and belief.

778
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,411
I'll bet you $100

779
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,413
I nail the next person to walk in.

780
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,914
Ooh! I'm in.

781
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,416
Hey, I can do that.

782
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,418
All right.

783
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,419
A little life in here.

784
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,420
Who's holding?
Paula?

785
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,921
There you go.

786
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,422
Contract signature

787
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,924
From the next person
to step inside.

788
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:27,925
But if not,

789
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,426
Forget the money,
just lower prices.

790
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:30,427
All right.

791
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:31,929
How much you got
there, paula?

792
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:41,439
Piece of cake.

793
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,440
Hold that for me, will ya?

794
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,941
Can I have my hat, Paula?

795
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,948
Hey, there!
I'm Hal Jackson.

796
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,449
Welcome to the best selection,

797
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,951
The finest-built cars and trucks

798
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,452
This side of Detroit.

799
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,955
Don't touch me.

800
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,957
Well, of course not.
No, ma'am.

801
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:00,958
Uh...

802
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,960
Hell, I understand
what's happening.

803
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,962
There's a recession
going on.

804
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,964
I'll tell you what--
no down payment.

805
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,465
Now, you looking for
something special?

806
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,469
Yeah. Your head on a stick.

807
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,971
This is gonna be a tough sale.

808
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,973
My...

809
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,975
Well, now, uh...

810
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,477
Is it just trucks
you have a problem with,

811
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,479
Or is it me?

812
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,481
Just you.

813
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,983
Say, are you the young lady

814
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,485
From the animal rights group?

815
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,989
No, I'm not.
I'm Zora Mathews' mother.

816
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,492
Oh.

817
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,495
Wow.

818
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,497
All right.

819
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,499
You want to step inside for a minute?

820
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,500
Yeah.

821
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,001
All right.

822
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,514
Damn! Check that out.

823
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,517
Maybe I'm making a mistake
getting a truck.

824
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,018
I think we might
be making a mistake

825
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,020
By coming down here.

826
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,521
It's kind of flashy,

827
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,023
But flashy can be good.

828
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:07,024
Hi, gorgeous.

829
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,526
You look a lot better.

830
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,028
Flashy can also mean
you're a penis head.

831
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,030
This is Tea Cake.

832
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,032
You her little brother?

833
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,534
Ah--kiss my ass.

834
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,969
Excuse me.
Nice to meet you.

835
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,206
Let's get something straight

836
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,708
Right now, ok?

837
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,710
There's no way you're the father.

838
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,212
I knew there was
some kind of screw-up!

839
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,713
I ordered a black man.

840
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,715
Well, thank God.

841
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,217
So, what seems
to be the problem?

842
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,219
I'll tell you
what the problem is.

843
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,721
My daughter came to you
to pour her heart out,

844
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:38,723
And you offered her
a kidney.

845
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,724
Who the hell
do you think you are?

846
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,725
Oh, now wait a second, lady.

847
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,226
She caught me off guard.

848
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,728
I donate an ounce of sperm 18 years ago,

849
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,231
And today some kid wants
to call me daddy.

850
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,232
Excuse me.

851
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,234
She does not want
to call you daddy.

852
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,735
Fooled the hell
outta me!

853
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,738
Oh, did it? Why does
that surprise me?

854
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,239
Because you are a fool!

855
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,240
You are the scum

856
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,242
That clogs up the cable stations,

857
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,244
And even if you were black,

858
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,245
I wouldn't like you,

859
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,746
So you stay away from my kid!

860
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,748
Now listen! Who's
following who around?

861
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,250
She came to me first.

862
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,252
You keep her away from me!

863
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:09,754
Are you giving me face?

864
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:13,257
What the hell's that mean?

865
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,259
Ahem. Good morning.
Could I interest you--

866
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,260
No.

867
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,762
0 For 2.

868
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,263
Hello.
Can I interest you

869
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:20,264
In a test drive

870
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,267
Of a new model car or truck?

871
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,769
Well, y-yeah.

872
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,270
I'm into whatever
you want to show me.

873
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,771
Well, good. Why don't
you come this way?

874
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,741
Me or my daughter?

875
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,743
I had no intention of
judging you or your--

876
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:33,744
Mom.

877
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,745
Oh, great.

878
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,746
What are you doing here?

879
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:36,747
Good question.

880
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,750
The question is,
what are you doing here?

881
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,251
Look, wait a minute.

882
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,753
Anyone mind if I
have a cigarette?

883
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,254
Yes, I do mind!

884
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,256
This is his office!

885
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,757
But these are my lungs.

886
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,258
Let him kill himself
and not me.

887
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,761
How about a drink, then?
You got a problem with that?

888
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,764
No, I don't.
Why don't you make it two?

889
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,266
Ma, you never drink hard liquor.

890
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,268
What a shame.

891
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:58,769
Make it a double.

892
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,771
All right. One drink coming up.

893
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,273
You know, I noticed

894
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,274
That you're having a hard time

895
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,277
Keeping yourself
in school these days.

896
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,779
I wanted to talk to Hal.

897
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,781
You know, a good education
is invaluable.

898
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,782
She knows that.

899
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,285
She's going to Berkeley
next fall.

900
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,787
I wanted to go to Berkeley.

901
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,288
I got into M.I.T.,

902
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,290
And that's my first choice.

903
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,292
Yeah, well, she doesn't
really want to go

904
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,794
All the way to Boston.

905
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,295
Yes, I do really want to
go all the way to Boston.

906
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,298
We can't afford it, can we?

907
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,300
My science teacher

908
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,302
Is helping me with scholarships.

909
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,304
Ahh!

910
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,306
She's always winning stuff like that.

911
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,307
Look at her.

912
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,309
She's so cute, she's so smart.

913
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,810
Ma...

914
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,811
Mom, don't start.

915
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,812
I'm sorry.

916
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,814
First you don't want me to go,

917
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,816
Now I'm winning all these awards.

918
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:46,817
What?

919
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:48,318
Well, I just think

920
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,320
That you could take
all your awards you win

921
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,321
And use them in Berkeley.

922
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,322
This is really good.

923
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,326
Ma, I don't want
to go to Berkeley!

924
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,827
I wanted to go to Berkeley.

925
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,829
Who asked ya?

926
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,831
The--never mind.

927
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,333
Can I have some more?

928
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:05,836
You've got to sit down

929
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,838
In this baby.

930
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,840
Just wait.

931
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,841
See?

932
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,342
I like this.

933
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,345
See? That's a good color for you.

934
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,346
Yeah. Yellow.

935
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,348
You're not feeling too nervous

936
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,350
About buying a truck, are you?

937
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,851
No. No, not at all.

938
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,354
Good. Most men aren't, I find.

939
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,855
You working now?

940
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,856
Yeah, yeah.

941
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,357
Good.

942
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,360
May I ask where you work?

943
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,861
At a bank.

944
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,862
At a bank.

945
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,864
And what department would that be?

946
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,365
Uh, deposits.

947
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,868
Deposits.

948
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,873
And withdrawals?

949
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,375
No. Just deposits.

950
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,376
Oh.

951
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:46,877
Cool.

952
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,380
Key.

953
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,381
Ooh.

954
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,382
Nuts.

955
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:52,883
Isn't it?

956
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,392
Ma, let's just go home.

957
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,894
Let's go talk about college.

958
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,395
I want to sing.

959
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,897
That's a good idea.
Go on home.

960
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:07,898
Who asked you?

961
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,900
This is his office.
Let's go!

962
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,902
I know this is his office.

963
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,403
I know that.
Look at this place.

964
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,905
I mean, please!

965
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:15,906
Look at it!

966
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:19,409
Cheesy wood, bowling trophies.

967
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,912
Western motif makes me ill.

968
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,914
Of course!
And the titty sisters!

969
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,415
This is absolutely his office.

970
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,918
And look--
Green shag carpeting.

971
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,419
My fave.

972
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,421
And what's this?

973
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,422
Aah!

974
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,424
Hi! Look at you.
Look at her.

975
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:34,925
Oh, no.
Al, no.

976
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,426
Alberta,
Thank you, Alberta.

977
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,428
That'll be all, honey.

978
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,929
Yeah, ok.

979
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:39,930
Is that your mom?

980
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,931
His mom!

981
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,433
You got a problem
with my office?

982
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,436
No. It's just that she
hates shag carpeting.

983
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:46,437
Mom, let's go! Please!

984
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,938
Don't apologize for me.

985
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,940
I Have a big problem with him.

986
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,941
She can say

987
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:51,942
Whatever she wants to.

988
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,443
She's got rights.

989
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,946
Why don't you just butt out?

990
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,948
I'd love to butt out,

991
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:58,949
But it's my office!

992
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,450
You'd don't have to
keep repeating that!

993
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,452
I'm aware
we're in your office!

994
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,953
Mom, let's go home.

995
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,454
I'm not ready to go!

996
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,457
I have a point to make!

997
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,959
Wha--what is your point?

998
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,961
I'll tell you what my point is.

999
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,964
My point is this--
We don't want you.

1000
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:14,965
You don't want us.

1001
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:15,966
Let's keep that clear.

1002
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,468
You are not the father.

1003
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,470
And even if you were,

1004
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,971
We still wouldn't want you.

1005
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,973
Hell, she doesn't
look anything like me.

1006
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:23,974
Thank God
For tha--

1007
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,490
I'm gonna sit down.

1008
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,500
Ma, are you ok?

1009
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,502
Huh?

1010
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,003
Are you all right?

1011
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,007
Yeah.

1012
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,016
So... ahem.

1013
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,018
Where'd you park?

1014
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,520
Uh, down--down the sidewalk.

1015
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,022
Oh, I do that, too.

1016
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,024
She rode her bicycle.

1017
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,026
Oh.

1018
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,029
Well, maybe we ought to...

1019
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,531
Yeah.

1020
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,532
All right. Here we go.

1021
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:29,039
Uh, thank you--
Thank you for having us.

1022
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,040
Aw...

1023
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,546
We're cuttin' prices.

1024
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,048
Yes!

1025
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:39,550
Sorry.

1026
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,551
I don't like white people.

1027
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,553
Shh!

1028
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:50,060
Hey, I think I bought a truck.

1029
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:54,064
Say,
I tell you what.

1030
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,066
Put the bicycle in the truck.

1031
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,068
I'll drive you where you're goin'.

1032
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,570
I don't need any help.
Good-bye.

1033
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,075
Oohhh...

1034
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:09,579
Zora, right?

1035
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,081
Yes.

1036
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,083
You kind of caught me

1037
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,584
By surprise yesterday, Zora.

1038
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,588
I Want to apologize
if I hurt your feelings.

1039
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,589
It's ok.

1040
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,592
I'm sorry that
my mom showed up here.

1041
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,094
No problem.

1042
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,099
Good-bye.

1043
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,602
Bye.

1044
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:36,106
Ooh, ooh, ooh, shit!

1045
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,109
Oh, Christ!

1046
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,610
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah...

1047
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:47,117
God damn it!

1048
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,555
What is wrong with you, coming
around that corner like that?

1049
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:09,556
Are you crazy?

1050
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,057
Stop the car. Aah!

1051
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:12,959
Oh, look at that--
A Parking space.

1052
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,945
God damn it, pull the car over!

1053
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,447
Just let me out.

1054
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,449
Are you gonna unlock
the door, or what?

1055
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,451
Come on and unlock this damn door

1056
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:21,952
Before I slap you!

1057
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:23,453
I Can't stand your ass!

1058
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,456
Son of a bitch!
What is wrong with you?

1059
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,458
Are you crazy, coming
Around that corner!

1060
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,460
Where do you think
you are, in L.A.?

1061
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,961
Goddamn crazy white people.

1062
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,462
Hello there, folks!

1063
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,465
Thank you very much
for the ride!

1064
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:36,467
Do you mind
if I come in

1065
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,969
And drain the lizard?

1066
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:39,970
If you drain the--

1067
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,473
Does that mean you have
to go to the bathroom?

1068
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:43,473
Uh-huh.

1069
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:44,975
Fine. come on in!

1070
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,476
You crazy...

1071
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,980
You locked us in.

1072
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,982
We were gonna call 911,

1073
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,984
But then we started reading books.

1074
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,486
I'll take these. They're fascinating.

1075
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,489
We'll take everything,
and...

1076
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,492
I am so sorry, dear.

1077
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,495
I really had no idea we'd
done so many awful things.

1078
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,497
Hello.

1079
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,499
Hello.

1080
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:09,500
Ladies.

1081
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,001
Hell of an idea--

1082
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,003
Lock the customers in
till they buy something.

1083
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,504
Wonder if that work
with trucks?

1084
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,007
Oh, my god,
look at this place.

1085
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,008
Book city.

1086
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,509
You read all this?

1087
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,011
The bathroom's upstairs

1088
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,012
On the right.

1089
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,514
Oh... we haven't been up there.

1090
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:25,516
No!

1091
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,518
There's nothing up there to buy.

1092
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,019
Oh.
Oh.

1093
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,021
Well, we have a check

1094
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:35,025
All made out for you,
including tax at 7 1/2 %.

1095
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,527
Oh, no, no, no.
It's 8 1/2.

1096
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:38,529
Maybe you're right.

1097
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,031
Who cares? You're done.

1098
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:42,032
Oh! thanks.

1099
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,033
Thank you.

1100
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,034
That's great.

1101
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,035
Happy wedding.

1102
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:46,036
Bye! Thanks.

1103
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,038
Let me help you.
Bye-bye, now.

1104
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,539
Bye!

1105
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,541
Bye-bye, ladies!

1106
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,542
Bye-bye, now.

1107
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,543
Bye!
Bye!

1108
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,545
Whoo! Black authors
up the Wahzoo.

1109
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:58,048
I read black authors, you know.

1110
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,550
Wilt Chamberlain book
changed my life.

1111
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,053
Heh heh heh heh heh!

1112
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,554
Oh, wait a second here.

1113
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,056
Maybe I don't have to go anymore.

1114
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,059
Nope, there it is!

1115
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,560
Little silvery feelin'.

1116
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,062
The call of the wild.

1117
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,106
Is this the guy?

1118
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,110
Is who what guy?

1119
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,112
The guy.

1120
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:05,615
The guy that was supposed
to be Zora's father but isn't,

1121
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,117
Because... you know.

1122
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,120
Yeah. That's
my husband Charles.

1123
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,621
Charlie.

1124
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,624
Looks nice.

1125
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,627
Was he nice?

1126
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,631
Yeah, he was nice.

1127
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,633
Never remarried?

1128
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,635
Tthh. no.

1129
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,136
I mean,

1130
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,638
What's the point?

1131
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,640
Yeah.

1132
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,141
Yeah, I'm divorced.

1133
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,142
Twice.

1134
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,647
Right now, I'm...
Living with someone.

1135
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,649
Mmm...

1136
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,651
Never had any children.

1137
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:43,654
Huh.

1138
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,157
That Zora, looks like a nice kid.

1139
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,661
Ohh, she's a great kid.

1140
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,163
I don't know what I
would've done without her.

1141
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,668
Family really is the way to go.

1142
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,672
I live to enjoy myself.

1143
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,183
Funny thing--sperm.

1144
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,690
Well, what do we got here?

1145
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,693
"Jesus was a black man."

1146
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,196
Well, hell, at least you
got yourself a point of view.

1147
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,699
Must be a real bummer
having a half-white kid.

1148
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,201
Fuck you.

1149
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,203
Apparently we already did that.

1150
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,205
You know what? Get out.

1151
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,707
For being such a free spirit,

1152
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,209
You are surprisingly uptight.

1153
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,212
You, not surprisingly,
are a pain in the ass.

1154
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,214
It turns out,
that I have a daughter

1155
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,715
That I'd never even heard about.

1156
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,718
You don't have a daughter.

1157
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:50,220
I have a daughter.
You have a car dealership.

1158
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,721
I thought we straightened
all this out.

1159
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,223
Fine by me.

1160
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:54,725
But are you sure
it's fine with her?

1161
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,226
She's the one
that hunted me out.

1162
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,728
Maybe she wants to see me.

1163
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,230
I don't think so.

1164
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,232
I was always good
at math and science.

1165
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,234
Maybe I had something
to do with that part.

1166
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,735
You had nothing to do with it.

1167
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,738
Nothing. Do you understand me?

1168
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,740
I understand you, your highness.

1169
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,742
I can't talk to you anymore.

1170
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,244
It's ok. I'm outta here.

1171
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,245
Mm-hmm.

1172
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,747
Have a nice life.

1173
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:18,749
I will.

1174
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,761
Hi.

1175
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,262
Hi.

1176
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,265
Ok. What's up?

1177
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,767
You think he's my father?

1178
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:38,769
Look...

1179
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,271
All he was was some sperm

1180
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,273
With one motivated swimmer.

1181
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,774
That's all.

1182
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:49,779
I just wish I could've
asked him a few questions.

1183
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,283
Why? The man is so dumb,
what was he gonna tell you?

1184
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,785
Forget it. It's over.
Leave it alone.

1185
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,287
I know, ma, but you don't--

1186
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:01,791
Please. I really don't want
to talk about this anymore.

1187
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,795
Ok.

1188
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,800
Ma, just one thing.

1189
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,301
What?

1190
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,303
When you were alone with him,

1191
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,804
Did he say anything about me?

1192
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,309
Is it really that important to you?

1193
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,312
Yes.

1194
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,317
Well, yeah, he did.

1195
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,819
He said, uh...

1196
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,823
That you seemed really smart...

1197
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,325
And really confident.

1198
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:38,328
He also said he thought
you were really beautiful.

1199
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:40,330
Really?

1200
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:41,331
Yeah.

1201
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:42,332
Really?

1202
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,334
I cross my heart, yeah.

1203
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:47,337
That's cool.

1204
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:53,843
Good night.

1205
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,847
Good night, my daughter.

1206
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,348
I love you.

1207
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,849
I love you, too.

1208
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,856
It's not true...

1209
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,858
But it's cool.

1210
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,062
This is Hal Jackson
of Jackson motors,

1211
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,564
Asking you to bear in mind

1212
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,566
There's a reason
so many people come to us

1213
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,568
For deals on cars and trucks.

1214
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,070
Ugh, god.

1215
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,073
Now I'm gonna wrestle
with you over--

1216
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:27,076
Daddy?

1217
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,578
Sarah?

1218
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:29,579
Daddy!

1219
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,580
Oh, daddy!

1220
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,582
I found you.

1221
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,584
They said you were dead, but...

1222
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,086
You should try this.

1223
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,087
Hal, you should try this.

1224
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:39,088
Uh-huh.

1225
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,591
Don't you know me, daddy?

1226
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,593
I'm Sarah! I'm Sarah!

1227
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:47,597
The final price will be... shocking!

1228
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,601
But I'm Sarah!

1229
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,107
Yes.

1230
00:52:58,608 --> 00:52:59,609
Yes.

1231
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,611
Sarah!

1232
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,112
My baby.

1233
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,616
Her majesty, the queen.

1234
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,626
My daddy.

1235
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:49,960
Hello.

1236
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,961
Hey, how're you doin'?

1237
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:51,962
All right.

1238
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,966
Where's Zora?

1239
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,968
Uh, she just left.

1240
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,971
Oh. She go get lunch?

1241
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:03,473
Um... you--you know,

1242
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,974
She never really tells me.

1243
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,477
I just--I don't know.

1244
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,978
You don't know.

1245
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,480
What do you mean you don't know?

1246
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,481
Where is she?

1247
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,484
Don't ignore me.

1248
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,487
You better tell me where she is...

1249
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:18,488
Ow!

1250
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,490
Or I'll rip out your tracheae.

1251
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,491
Oh, Zora.

1252
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,492
Yeah, Zora.

1253
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:24,994
She went to the car dealership.

1254
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:25,996
What!?

1255
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,497
She went. I didn't go.

1256
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,498
Ow!

1257
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,502
This is Hal Jackson
of Jackson motors

1258
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,504
Inviting you to come on down
and see the circus of deals

1259
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:35,505
We've got going

1260
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:38,508
On the latest model cars
and trucks.

1261
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,510
Tiny, down.

1262
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:42,512
Don't forget.

1263
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,514
10 % back means 10 % more peanuts

1264
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,015
In your pocket.

1265
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,018
Isn't that right, Tiny?

1266
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,520
Or did you forget again?

1267
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,022
Great.

1268
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,023
Cueing Tiny.

1269
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,025
Up again!

1270
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:56,526
Heigh-ho, Tiny!

1271
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:58,027
Cut, cut, cut.

1272
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,029
Reset.

1273
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,030
Reset, Tiny.

1274
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,031
Resetting, Tiny.

1275
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,033
What the hell you mean cut?

1276
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,035
We're losing you when Tiny rears up.

1277
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,037
Ok. we're ready to go again.

1278
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,039
Oh, my God, she's back.

1279
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,540
Concentration, Hal.

1280
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,041
Give me a cigarette quick.

1281
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,044
You're talking to me--

1282
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,046
Just shut up and give me
the damn cigarette.

1283
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,550
Great.

1284
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,052
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

1285
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,054
Hey, lady!

1286
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,055
Hello.

1287
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,559
This is Hal Jackson
of Jackson motors.

1288
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,561
This is supposed to be
a closed set.

1289
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:33,563
Whoa! Hey!

1290
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,067
Whoa!

1291
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,069
Don't forget.

1292
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:42,572
10 % back means 10 % more
peanuts in your pocket.

1293
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:45,575
Isn't that right, Tiny?
Oh, no, no, Tiny.

1294
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:48,578
Uh-oh.

1295
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,082
Whoa. what's happening?

1296
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,085
Here we go again.

1297
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,588
Alert the media!

1298
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,089
The press! Call the press!

1299
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,092
Ma, look.

1300
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,594
Ooh! whoo!

1301
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,095
Oh, shit!

1302
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:13,103
Oh, God!

1303
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,604
Stop ringin' the goddamn bell!

1304
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:16,606
We're right behind you, babe!

1305
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,108
Stop ringin' the goddamn bell!

1306
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,613
Oh, shit!

1307
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,114
Oh!

1308
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,071
Oh, shit!

1309
00:56:32,071 --> 00:56:34,573
Stop ringin' the goddamn--ow!

1310
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:35,575
Ooohh!

1311
00:56:36,075 --> 00:56:37,076
Whoa!

1312
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,082
You better be shooting!
You cut, you die!

1313
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:44,083
You cut, you die!

1314
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:46,085
This is all fabulous!

1315
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:47,586
Ohh!

1316
00:56:53,593 --> 00:56:55,094
Move! Move!

1317
00:56:55,094 --> 00:56:57,596
Oh, Lord, help!

1318
00:56:57,597 --> 00:56:59,098
Hal, it's Kimberly.

1319
00:56:59,098 --> 00:57:01,100
You never called.

1320
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,102
Oh, hi.

1321
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:07,106
Stop! Whoa! Whoa!

1322
00:57:07,106 --> 00:57:08,107
Oh, Jesus.

1323
00:57:12,912 --> 00:57:15,414
Coming through. Watch your feet.

1324
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:16,416
Coming through.

1325
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:21,170
Please, stop ringing the goddamn bell!

1326
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,672
Oh, Jesus!

1327
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,579
Shit! Son of a...

1328
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,861
Keep rolling.

1329
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:45,862
Ta-da!

1330
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,541
Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you. I'm alive.

1331
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,042
Mom!

1332
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,045
I'm lucky. I'm lucky.

1333
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:03,546
Thank you, baby.

1334
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,048
It wasn't my fault.

1335
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:09,052
Wait! Wait till
you see the footage.

1336
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,553
2 News crews showed up.

1337
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:11,554
I'm alive.

1338
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,055
Are you ok?

1339
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,557
Yes, I'm fine.

1340
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,058
Ma, not you.

1341
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,560
Are you all right?

1342
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,062
Do I look all right to you?

1343
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,064
Wait.

1344
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,066
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

1345
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,568
The elephant was
following the bell,

1346
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:26,569
Your bell.

1347
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:27,570
This...

1348
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:32,074
This goddamn bell.

1349
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:34,577
It was?

1350
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,078
Oh, shit.

1351
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,580
Yeah. he was.

1352
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,582
He was following my bell?

1353
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,584
I thought you were dead

1354
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:42,585
At that intersection.

1355
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,086
That was close, wasn't it?

1356
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,588
Yeah. Yeah.

1357
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,591
My bell.

1358
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:53,096
You mean you ended up
in the water

1359
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,598
Because of my bell?

1360
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,099
I'm sorry.

1361
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:00,103
Wait!

1362
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,606
You know something?
You can go to hell.

1363
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,607
If I could follow you.

1364
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:07,109
I'll ring my bell
so you know it's me.

1365
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,611
He's really pissed.

1366
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,063
You're gorgeous
when you're wet.

1367
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,155
Just take my word for it.

1368
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:21,657
It was a disaster.

1369
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,159
Goddamn disaster.

1370
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,162
I hear elephants can
be very, very violent.

1371
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,664
Plus--did you know something?
They're pregnant for 2 years.

1372
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:31,167
2 Years. Can you imagine that?

1373
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,669
Then the baby elephant
comes out--

1374
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,672
Has this really
bristly hair.

1375
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:36,673
Turn over.

1376
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,176
Stacy, honey,
My whole career's

1377
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,677
Going down the toilet,

1378
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,179
And you're talking

1379
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,180
About pregnant elephants?

1380
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,683
Aw, monkey man,
you're full of stress.

1381
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:50,186
There's a point right here
in your hand

1382
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,188
That if I squeeze--
Close your eyes.

1383
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,190
This isn't going to hurt.

1384
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,192
Ha!

1385
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,693
Does that feel better?

1386
00:59:58,695 --> 00:59:59,696
That's better, isn't it?

1387
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:00,696
Ow.

1388
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,198
Turn over again.

1389
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:03,699
Ooh!

1390
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,701
You know something?

1391
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,202
If you did lose your business,

1392
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,703
You could always take the time

1393
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,205
To explore your artistic side.

1394
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,207
Like I always thought
you had the hands

1395
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:14,210
Of somebody who could be a surgeon

1396
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,711
Or play the violin or something.

1397
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,213
But Stacy, honey--

1398
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,214
I know what
you're going to say.

1399
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:21,217
Nobody listens
to the violin anymore.

1400
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:24,220
And that's true,
but you could make them do it

1401
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,222
By playing it
in a whole new way,

1402
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,724
Like, for example,
more bluesy, perhaps,

1403
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:29,726
Or... Rap!

1404
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,727
Rap! Rap!

1405
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:31,728
Rap even!

1406
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:34,230
You could do it
Like a--oh.

1407
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,231
Oh, sorry.

1408
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,232
I--oh.

1409
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,234
Your head hurts, doesn't it?

1410
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,736
Do you want me to, um,

1411
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,739
Maybe sing you a song or something?

1412
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,741
Ok.

1413
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,743
No. no, please don't.

1414
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,745
It's a very nice song.

1415
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,246
Music can be so healing.

1416
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,748
This is the song.

1417
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,718
Ohh.

1418
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:46,852
What's going on?

1419
01:01:46,853 --> 01:01:48,354
No, hold on a second.

1420
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:50,356
Wait. stop! I can explain.

1421
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:51,857
I'm so glad you're here!

1422
01:01:51,858 --> 01:01:52,859
Are they

1423
01:01:52,859 --> 01:01:53,860
Repossessing everything?

1424
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,862
No! Everything's selling.

1425
01:01:55,862 --> 01:01:58,865
It was that whole Tiny thing
that went big.

1426
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:00,366
You're a smash.

1427
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:01,867
Bobby, get over here.
What's happening?

1428
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:03,369
Money! Money!
We're making money!

1429
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:04,870
Sign this. It's beautiful.

1430
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:06,372
They're just flying out of here.

1431
01:02:06,372 --> 01:02:07,873
Hey, boss! Hey. Hey. Hey.

1432
01:02:07,874 --> 01:02:09,876
It's like you always said,

1433
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:10,877
We got a better product.

1434
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:11,878
If we can get them into the door,

1435
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:12,879
They'll buy it.

1436
01:02:12,879 --> 01:02:13,880
It's you and that elephant lady.

1437
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,382
You're on every news
broadcast in the city.

1438
01:02:16,382 --> 01:02:17,883
You're a hit, cowboy!
You're a hit!

1439
01:02:17,884 --> 01:02:18,885
Where's the lady?

1440
01:02:18,885 --> 01:02:19,886
Where's Tiny?

1441
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:20,887
Who? Oh, the elephant.

1442
01:02:21,387 --> 01:02:22,388
Drowned, I guess.

1443
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:25,841
I'm sorry, little girl.
I didn't mean that.

1444
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,344
I'm just kidding.
Uh, carry on.

1445
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,845
Well, hello, ladies.

1446
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,347
Look at you all.

1447
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,348
Over here!

1448
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:33,849
Over here! Please!

1449
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,352
I'll be damned!

1450
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:39,856
Yes!

1451
01:02:41,607 --> 01:02:43,742
Let me
just show you this truck.

1452
01:02:43,743 --> 01:02:45,077
This truck was made for love.

1453
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:46,578
Look at the size of this cab.

1454
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:48,080
You can give birth in this cab

1455
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,081
And when you do it,

1456
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:50,582
You can listen to the radio.

1457
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:53,085
Am, fm, uhf, vhf...

1458
01:03:09,602 --> 01:03:11,103
So what time are you done?

1459
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,105
Well, I teach until 10:00.

1460
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:15,107
You have dinner plans, don't you?

1461
01:03:15,107 --> 01:03:18,610
Oh, yeah. We're all
going out and celebrating.

1462
01:03:18,611 --> 01:03:19,612
Good night, boss.

1463
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:22,114
Good night, Bobby.
Unbelievable day.

1464
01:03:22,114 --> 01:03:24,116
We damn near sold
every car on the lot.

1465
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:25,117
Mmm.

1466
01:03:25,117 --> 01:03:28,120
Oh, that's nice.

1467
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,621
All right.
I'll see you later.

1468
01:03:29,622 --> 01:03:30,623
Ok.

1469
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:32,625
Good-bye, baby.

1470
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,626
Hi.

1471
01:03:33,626 --> 01:03:34,627
Hi.

1472
01:03:34,627 --> 01:03:35,628
Mmm. Good.

1473
01:03:35,628 --> 01:03:38,631
You have very strong hands.

1474
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:40,132
Thanks.

1475
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:42,134
Whoa.

1476
01:03:42,134 --> 01:03:43,635
Get out of here. It's late.

1477
01:03:44,136 --> 01:03:45,137
I'm going.

1478
01:03:49,642 --> 01:03:51,644
Boy, I'll tell you, huh?

1479
01:03:52,144 --> 01:03:53,645
Perfect night for a celebration.

1480
01:03:54,146 --> 01:03:55,147
Sure is.

1481
01:03:55,648 --> 01:03:56,148
Night.

1482
01:03:56,649 --> 01:03:57,650
Good night.

1483
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,651
Jamaica, mon, this close.

1484
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:00,652
Night, chief.

1485
01:04:01,153 --> 01:04:02,154
Whew!

1486
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:03,155
Hey, Jose!

1487
01:04:03,656 --> 01:04:04,657
They wiped us out.

1488
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:06,158
Whew! I'm telling you.

1489
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:08,160
Stripped us clean.

1490
01:04:08,661 --> 01:04:09,662
Yeah.

1491
01:04:10,162 --> 01:04:12,164
So, what are you gonna do?

1492
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:13,666
You gonna celebrate?

1493
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:14,666
Oh, sort of.

1494
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:16,168
Tonight's my poker night.

1495
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:17,670
You got any plans?

1496
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,171
Yeah. I'm covered.

1497
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:20,172
I'll see you, man.

1498
01:04:20,172 --> 01:04:21,173
All right. Good night,

1499
01:04:21,173 --> 01:04:22,174
Good night.

1500
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:23,175
And what a night!

1501
01:04:23,175 --> 01:04:24,676
Hell of a night.

1502
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,705
Hey, mrs. Mathews,

1503
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,208
Um, I'm a little concerned.

1504
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,210
What do we actually know

1505
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,213
About this guy Zora's
going out with tonight?

1506
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,715
Didn't you check him out

1507
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,217
Or whatever parents
are supposed to do?

1508
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,219
Why are you still here?

1509
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,220
Don't you have any dignity?

1510
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,221
You need to go home.

1511
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,725
Get the door.

1512
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,226
Oh, my God!

1513
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,228
Hey, this is worse than I thought.

1514
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,229
What is?

1515
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,730
'scuse me.

1516
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:10,732
Oh, no, you don't, miss thing.

1517
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:12,734
You better go put on a jacket.

1518
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:13,736
No, you don't, miss thing.

1519
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,237
You better go put on a jacket.

1520
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,238
You better shut up.

1521
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:17,239
Ma, will you get him out of here

1522
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,240
Before I kill him?

1523
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,741
Somebody get the door.

1524
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,744
Oh, this is how it is?
Is this how we living?

1525
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,245
Ok. No, that's fine.

1526
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:25,247
You can go and flaunt your fun bags

1527
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,249
Any way you please.

1528
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,753
I just got one thing

1529
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:31,754
To say to y'all, ok?

1530
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:32,755
Funbag flaunting

1531
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:33,756
Only leads to trouble.

1532
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,760
Get the door.

1533
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,261
Just remember I said it, all right?

1534
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:43,265
Yo, it's a white man at the door.

1535
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,269
Am I interrupting something?

1536
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,271
No. Um...

1537
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,274
How are you?

1538
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,775
I'm ok.

1539
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,778
I brought something
for you and your mother.

1540
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,281
Why?

1541
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:00,282
Ma.

1542
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,785
I'm not really sure.

1543
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,786
There you go.

1544
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:31,313
I'm not good at,
you know, receiving,

1545
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,315
And so I don't want
you to think

1546
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,816
That I don't like it.

1547
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:38,320
Which in your language
means thank you.

1548
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:40,823
Yes.

1549
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:41,824
Thank you.

1550
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,325
You're welcome.

1551
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,837
"The world is waiting for you,

1552
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,339
"And here are a few maps

1553
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,844
In case you get lost along the way.
Hal."

1554
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,346
Thank you.

1555
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,854
You're welcome.

1556
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,856
Well, yeah.

1557
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:16,859
Well, I guess I ought to be going.

1558
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:18,360
I'll walk you out.

1559
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:20,862
Hey, be cool, man.

1560
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,866
Yeah. Thank you very much.

1561
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,878
That was a really nice thing
you did.

1562
01:08:35,878 --> 01:08:36,879
She's thrilled.

1563
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,380
Thank you.

1564
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,882
So, are we getting along now?

1565
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,885
Come on, what does that mean?

1566
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:45,387
I'm not sure. I'm just checking.

1567
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:51,393
Hey, Diego, what are you doing here?

1568
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:54,897
Me, boss? What are you doing here?

1569
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:56,898
Hi. i'm--
I'm Zora's mother.

1570
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:58,400
Hi. I'm Diego.

1571
01:08:58,901 --> 01:08:59,902
Very nice to meet you.

1572
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:00,903
Thank you.

1573
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:01,904
Behave yourself.

1574
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:04,907
Hi.

1575
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,408
Wow.

1576
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,410
Oh, thank you.

1577
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,911
Shall we?

1578
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,413
Yes.

1579
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:14,916
Bye.

1580
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,418
You look great.

1581
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:17,419
And so do you.

1582
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,420
She's wearing that?

1583
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,422
That's exactly what I've been sayin'!

1584
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:21,423
Thank you.

1585
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,925
Hey, Diego, you have
her back here by--

1586
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:25,928
She got a curfew or something?

1587
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:26,929
Tell him by midnight.

1588
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,430
Have her back here by midnight!

1589
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,931
Yeah.

1590
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:30,933
Have a good time, you two.

1591
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,939
I Hope you like to dance.

1592
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,942
Oh, I love to dance.

1593
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,443
Bye, now.

1594
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:49,951
Do you know him?

1595
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:50,953
Yeah, yeah.

1596
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,454
He works for me.

1597
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:53,955
So if anything happens--

1598
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:54,957
I'll fire his ass.

1599
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,458
Ok.

1600
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,961
So, what's up, baby?

1601
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:02,464
You want to slide out for a minute?

1602
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:04,466
Well, no, I really shouldn't.

1603
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:05,467
Come on, baby.

1604
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:07,969
We'll go see a movie or something.

1605
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,972
Well, I'm just not really ready

1606
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,473
For a commitment.

1607
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,975
I just want to take you out.

1608
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,978
I said no!

1609
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,480
Bitch!

1610
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,482
Yo' motha!

1611
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,324
Well--ha ha.

1612
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:29,825
You probably have plans

1613
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,327
For the evening.

1614
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:32,828
Yeah, yeah.

1615
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,330
I'm gonna...

1616
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,331
Go out and grab something.

1617
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,834
What are you gonna grab?

1618
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:40,836
Eat. I want to eat.

1619
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,338
If you don't have any plans,

1620
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:43,839
You can come along.

1621
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,343
Do you want me to come?

1622
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:48,343
Yeah.

1623
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:50,345
I think I do.

1624
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,849
Ok. well, then,
I don't have any plans.

1625
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,351
You know something?

1626
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,353
You could have said that
right off the bat.

1627
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,356
Yeah, but you could've
just asked me to dinner.

1628
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,358
I have to go change.

1629
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:19,375
Hey, where's the, uh...

1630
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,376
Where's the rice and the noodles

1631
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:22,878
And the fella that flips the shrimp

1632
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:23,879
Into his hat?

1633
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,882
I shouldn't have ever let you order.

1634
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:28,383
Half this stuff still looks alive.

1635
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:29,885
That's the whole idea.

1636
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,387
You know what?

1637
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,389
When she was 7,

1638
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,892
I gave her one of those
Suzy homemaker oven things.

1639
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,393
They come with mixes.

1640
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:40,396
You're supposed to make stuff.
Not her.

1641
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,397
She was not interested.
All she wanted to do

1642
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,400
Was melt stuff in the oven.

1643
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,901
She gets that from me.

1644
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,903
I only use my oven
to dry my sneakers.

1645
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,905
I believe that.

1646
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:51,907
Hmm. Hmm. What the hell.

1647
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:53,408
No! No!

1648
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,411
Uh-oh.

1649
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:57,913
Oh, shit.

1650
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:01,416
No, you're not supposed
to eat it like that.

1651
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,918
Oh, God.

1652
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,422
Oh, God.

1653
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:10,425
You know, Jackson--

1654
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:11,427
I'll buy you another one.

1655
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:12,928
This is ours.

1656
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:13,929
Here. Drink this.

1657
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,431
Are you ok?

1658
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,433
Oh, shit.

1659
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:20,436
I just--

1660
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:23,939
He--he ate a Wasabi ball.

1661
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,445
I'm fine.

1662
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:30,946
Oh, my God.

1663
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,948
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to laugh,

1664
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:34,449
But you're so funny.

1665
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,952
I know that... now.

1666
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:37,953
You--

1667
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,957
Maybe just a little more.

1668
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:46,462
She just told you, silly move,
white man.

1669
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,966
Are you all right?

1670
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,467
I'm fine.

1671
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:53,969
You sure?

1672
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:54,970
Mm-hmm.

1673
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,975
You know, you're--
You're all glisteny.

1674
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,977
I think it's from the Wasabi.

1675
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:04,980
You might want to try
the crab next time.

1676
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,481
It's a little safer.

1677
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,484
Yeah. No, next time,
I'm ordering.

1678
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:09,985
That's what's happening.

1679
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:17,826
The only thing I can ride
is a horse.

1680
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:19,828
Not once have we
shot a horse commercial.

1681
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:20,829
It's crazy.

1682
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:21,830
That's probably because

1683
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:22,831
You'd look too good on a horse.

1684
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,332
They've got to make you look

1685
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,334
Like a wild man.

1686
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:26,835
That's part of the appeal.

1687
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:27,836
Really?

1688
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:29,838
Yeah.

1689
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,339
I never thought of it that way.

1690
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,348
You smell good.

1691
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:41,850
What?

1692
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,852
You smell good.

1693
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:46,354
It's just this lotion i'm using.

1694
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,356
May I?

1695
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,857
May you what?

1696
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,358
Smell you.

1697
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:52,361
Thought you already did that.

1698
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:53,362
Oh, wow.

1699
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,864
Oh, I could get lost in that smell.

1700
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:57,365
I could just close my eyes,

1701
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:59,868
And no one would ever find me.

1702
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,870
Oh, no.

1703
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,873
Somebody would find you.

1704
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:07,375
Maybe you could send up a flare.

1705
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,882
You smell like that
everywhere?

1706
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:15,383
I really don't know.

1707
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,886
I'm not in the habit
of smelling myself.

1708
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,387
I can check for you.

1709
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,393
You're really something,
you know?

1710
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:25,894
I'm just, you know,

1711
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:28,396
I'm not used to this kind of
stuff.

1712
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,899
Is this how you sell trucks?

1713
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,902
It's not like we haven't
been properly introduced.

1714
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,904
I don't mean to be crass,

1715
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:39,908
But my sperm has been in your body.

1716
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:40,909
And where it goes,

1717
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,911
You figure you should follow.

1718
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:44,913
Well, generally I like to go first,

1719
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:46,414
But the little fellas got
there before me.

1720
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:47,416
Oh. uh-huh.

1721
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,918
We have had the child, Sarah.

1722
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:53,421
We didn't have a child, Hal.

1723
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:55,424
I had a child.

1724
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,926
I'd like to make that up to you.

1725
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,427
I just bet you would.

1726
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,955
This could get complicated.

1727
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,957
Don't worry. I've done it before.

1728
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,458
I'll bet you have.

1729
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:39,468
Oh, yeah, you're slick.

1730
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,472
I'll change.

1731
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,478
No.

1732
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:50,979
Don't.

1733
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,482
What should I do?

1734
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:55,984
Smell me.

1735
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:10,999
Mm. Mm! Mmm! Mm!

1736
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:51,540
Hello.

1737
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,548
Diego, stop.

1738
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:00,549
What's wrong?

1739
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,051
I better go home. It's getting late.

1740
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:06,054
Let's go to my place.
You could stay over.

1741
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,555
Are you crazy?
My mother would kill me.

1742
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:12,560
Look, Diego,
I hardly know you.

1743
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:15,063
Let's get to know each
other better.

1744
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:16,064
Please.

1745
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:18,066
Please.

1746
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,576
What was that?

1747
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,578
It was just the bed.

1748
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:30,579
Just the bed.

1749
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,085
Oh, Jesus. It's Zora.

1750
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:40,088
Oh. Where's my hat?
I got your shoe.

1751
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:41,590
I don't know. Where?

1752
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:42,591
Right here.

1753
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,093
Where's my damn hat?

1754
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:46,595
My other shoe.

1755
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,096
Oh.

1756
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,098
Oh, jeez. They're right behind me.

1757
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,599
Wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1758
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,601
What's the hurry?

1759
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,102
They're outside.

1760
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:59,107
Oh.

1761
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,610
Every time you squeeze thigh master--

1762
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,111
Hey.

1763
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,113
Hi, honey.

1764
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:07,115
Hi.

1765
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:09,117
Squeeze your way to shapely thighs.

1766
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,618
We're watching TV.

1767
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,120
Look at that.

1768
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,121
Oh, it's late.

1769
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,122
Time got away.

1770
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,123
Thigh master is designed

1771
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,125
To isolate and strengthen
these muscles.

1772
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:19,127
What happened to the lamps?

1773
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:24,132
I guess they fell over.

1774
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:26,134
I'll be darned.

1775
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:31,640
Yeah, well, what
were you watching on tv?

1776
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:34,643
<i>studs.</i>
Talk show.

1777
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:35,644
Well--

1778
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,145
Talking. They were talking.

1779
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:38,646
Studs talking together.

1780
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,649
Ok.

1781
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:41,650
Hey, huh?

1782
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:44,653
Well--

1783
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:46,154
Boss.

1784
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,156
Hal junior.

1785
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:49,157
Jesus.

1786
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,659
Oh. All right.
Here we go. All right.

1787
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,162
We're out of here, Diego.

1788
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:56,164
Good night, Hal.

1789
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,167
Good night, Sarah.

1790
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,169
I'll walk you out.

1791
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,171
All right. That would be good.

1792
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:08,676
Quite a family, huh, man?

1793
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:11,179
I mean, like mother
like daughter, huh?

1794
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,681
You know what I mean?

1795
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,183
You lay a hand on that girl,

1796
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:16,684
And I'll kill you personally.

1797
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,186
Whoa. What's it to you?

1798
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,689
I'll tell you what it is to me.

1799
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,190
She's my daughter.

1800
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,191
Daughter?

1801
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:24,192
Oh, hell.

1802
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:26,194
I bet you I'm late.

1803
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:27,695
Good night, Diego.

1804
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,003
Oh, I'm tired.

1805
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,509
So what did you do?

1806
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,011
What?

1807
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:44,012
You heard me, ma.

1808
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,014
What were you guys doing?

1809
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,516
Doing?

1810
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:49,518
Nothing.

1811
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,520
So that's why the house looks

1812
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,021
Like a cyclone hit it?

1813
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,522
What are you talking about?

1814
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,024
You told me to stay away from him,

1815
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,025
But you can do

1816
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,526
Whatever you want with him?

1817
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,029
Zora--

1818
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:02,530
This is my father, ma,

1819
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,532
And he needs me, not you.

1820
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,535
My whole entire life,

1821
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,037
You brought me up with this fantasy,

1822
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:10,038
This ghost of Charlie,

1823
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,540
Then I finally bring
home something real,

1824
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,544
And you want to take
that away from me!

1825
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:17,045
What are you...

1826
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:19,547
What is going on?

1827
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:23,051
Ma, I wanted this
for me, not you.

1828
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:24,552
When this doesn't work out

1829
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,054
Between the two of you,

1830
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:28,056
Where is that gonna leave me?

1831
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,578
Sorry I got hung up, sweetheart.

1832
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,079
Oh, hi, Hal.

1833
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:53,081
You remember Bruce, don't you?

1834
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:56,084
Bruce gave me a lift home.

1835
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,588
Sure. Well, thank you, Bruce.

1836
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:01,089
No biggie.

1837
01:21:01,089 --> 01:21:02,590
Hey, have a seat, man.

1838
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:04,092
Where were you?

1839
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:07,095
Oh, I was just out driving around.

1840
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:09,097
I lost track of time, honey.

1841
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:10,098
Oh.

1842
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,599
I got to cruise.

1843
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,102
Oh, no, no. You got to?

1844
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:15,103
Yeah. I got to.

1845
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,604
I hear that. I'm beat.

1846
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:17,606
Hey, the night's

1847
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,107
Just starting to cook.

1848
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:20,108
I'm going to hear a new band--

1849
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,609
Stinky Nightgown.

1850
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:22,611
Stinky Nightgown?

1851
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:24,112
Oh, you like 'em?

1852
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,114
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1853
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:27,115
We got all their stuff.

1854
01:21:27,115 --> 01:21:28,116
They're gonna record

1855
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,618
As soon as the drummer
gets out of rehab.

1856
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,622
Hey, you dudes want
to hang with us tonight?

1857
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:34,623
No problem.

1858
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,624
Hey, why don't you go, sweetheart?

1859
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,126
I'll bet you'll enjoy that.

1860
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,128
Oh, wow. You don't mind?

1861
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:41,629
Hell, no. I want you to go.

1862
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,132
Thank you, sweetie.

1863
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,134
Let's fly.

1864
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,636
Oh. Have one of those sex dreams

1865
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,138
About me tonight, ok?

1866
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:51,639
Ok.

1867
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,141
You're welcome.

1868
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:56,144
He had this dream where
he was a big, stupid dog

1869
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,146
And I was a little smart dog...

1870
01:21:58,647 --> 01:21:59,648
I like dogs.

1871
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:00,649
Arf, arf.

1872
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:33,241
10 % off sticker, Charlie.

1873
01:23:34,242 --> 01:23:35,243
Hey, everybody.

1874
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,744
Hey, my favorite chief.

1875
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:37,746
Good morning.

1876
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:40,749
Oh, my god. What a beautiful scarf.

1877
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,251
You gave it to me.
Christmas '83.

1878
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:45,253
Did I? You know something, Alberta?

1879
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:46,754
You work too hard. Take the day off.

1880
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:47,756
Really?

1881
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:50,258
Do it now. Run!

1882
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:51,759
I'm feeling good.

1883
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,132
Great.

1884
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,134
Hi.

1885
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,635
Hi.

1886
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,142
I was thinking about last night.

1887
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:10,145
Oh, lord. Me, too.

1888
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:13,148
I'm, uh, I'm talking about Zora.

1889
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:16,651
She was really...

1890
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:19,153
Very upset about...

1891
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,658
This. Us. Uh...

1892
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:25,159
Why?

1893
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,162
Well, just because nobody's ever come

1894
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:29,664
Between us before.

1895
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:31,666
Well, sweetheart, I--

1896
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,170
I don't want to come
between you and Zora.

1897
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,671
Well, I know that,

1898
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:39,674
But, uh, you have.

1899
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,178
Well, how?

1900
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,679
Wait--uh, wait a minute.

1901
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,681
What did she say?

1902
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,683
It doesn't matter what she said.

1903
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:50,685
This would be easier
if you were a parent.

1904
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:51,686
Then I could explain it.

1905
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,689
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1906
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,190
What is this?

1907
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:59,194
Something feels really off here.

1908
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:01,196
Well...

1909
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:03,698
Look, Zora's really upset,

1910
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,700
And you couldn't see her upset

1911
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,701
For any longer

1912
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:07,702
Than you could take it.

1913
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:08,703
This is as long

1914
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:09,704
As I could take it for.

1915
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,707
All right.

1916
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,208
Let me talk to her, all right?

1917
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,212
What are you gonna say?

1918
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,214
Huh?

1919
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:20,215
You gonna explain--

1920
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:22,216
What you gonna say?

1921
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:23,718
Hey, what's the big deal?

1922
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,220
Come on, Hal, what was this?

1923
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,222
This was nothing but some kind of...

1924
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,224
Some kind of what, Sarah?

1925
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:31,226
Well, just some sort of...

1926
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:32,227
You know, attraction,

1927
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:34,229
Some... weird old attraction.

1928
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,730
Let's just get out of it

1929
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,232
Before somebody gets hurt.

1930
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,734
All right.

1931
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,236
Oh. Ok. I see what this is.

1932
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:43,738
What--

1933
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:45,740
You can go on with your
little speech if you want,

1934
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,241
But this is bullshit.

1935
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:48,743
What do you mean, this is bullshit?

1936
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:51,746
Don't give me your
motherly crap about Zora.

1937
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:53,247
What's going on is you got scared.

1938
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:55,250
What do you mean--Wait a minute.

1939
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,251
You know what? Just back off.

1940
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:57,752
Oh, yeah, right.

1941
01:25:57,752 --> 01:25:59,754
Oh, right.
Just back off, right?

1942
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,756
Walk away, make your life easy.

1943
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:03,257
You think you can control

1944
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:05,260
Every god damn thing, don't you?

1945
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,262
You can even have a kid
without meeting a man.

1946
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:09,764
All you gotta do
is put pictures on the wall

1947
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:10,765
And call it daddy!

1948
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:13,267
I got news for you.
It doesn't work that way!

1949
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:16,771
I got news for you, too.
Stay away from us!

1950
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,272
That's what we both want.

1951
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:19,774
Just stay away from us.

1952
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:23,277
I got a say in this, too.
God damn it!

1953
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:24,779
I'm her father!

1954
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:52,306
Thought I told you to go.

1955
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:53,308
I'm going.

1956
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:54,869
Zora.

1957
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:57,371
I'm sorry.

1958
01:27:57,372 --> 01:28:00,875
I can't think of anyplace
else to look.

1959
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:03,878
Have you seen my mother?

1960
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,390
I'm looking for my mother.

1961
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:17,391
Sarah Mathews?

1962
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:18,893
See the desk.

1963
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:22,397
Excuse me. We're looking
for a Sarah Mathews.

1964
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:24,899
Sir, Sarah Mathews, please.

1965
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,401
Are you family?

1966
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:27,902
This is her daughter.

1967
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:29,904
She came into E.R. this morning.

1968
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:31,405
We're sustaining her vital signs.

1969
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:33,908
She has a concussion,
and she's still unconscious.

1970
01:28:34,909 --> 01:28:37,411
We operated on her leg
this afternoon.

1971
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:38,413
Ma.

1972
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,917
She's going to be ok, right, doctor?

1973
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:46,421
The next 48 hours are critical.

1974
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,438
Mr. Jackson,
Ms. Mathews,

1975
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:05,440
At this time we ask
the family and friends

1976
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,942
To make a blood donation.

1977
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:09,443
Honey, why don't you go first?

1978
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,445
Come on. I'll take you.

1979
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:13,448
It's just right down the hall.

1980
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:16,451
Don't worry. It's gonna be ok.

1981
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:26,460
Did you see that doll
in here right before you?

1982
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:29,464
Mm-mm-mm. Coffee with just
the right touch of cream.

1983
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:30,465
Whoo, was she hot.

1984
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:32,967
My palms are still sweating.

1985
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:34,468
Blue jeans and red top?

1986
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,971
Her butt was a 10. You saw her?

1987
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:37,972
She's my daughter.

1988
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:40,475
And the interesting thing
is she's ab-negative.

1989
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:42,977
That's not very common.

1990
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:45,980
Well, she's an unusual girl.

1991
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,482
She won a science award last year.

1992
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:49,984
State contest. First prize.

1993
01:29:49,984 --> 01:29:52,486
You don't say.

1994
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,489
Oh, shit.

1995
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:26,020
I mean, it was really an awful fight,

1996
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,521
And then...

1997
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:30,525
Well, I guess it's just
what you're afraid of--

1998
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,527
That you'll--you'll yell at someone

1999
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:34,529
And fight with them,

2000
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,531
And then they'll die or whatever.

2001
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:37,532
I know.

2002
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:39,534
I Had a fight with her, too, though,

2003
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:40,535
So we'll never really know

2004
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:43,538
Which fight got her run over.

2005
01:30:43,538 --> 01:30:45,540
One thing we do know is,

2006
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:49,043
Neither one of us can
ever fight with her again,

2007
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:52,546
Which is too bad because
she's so damn good at it.

2008
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,048
Yeah.

2009
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:58,052
Hal, you can fight with me.

2010
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:00,554
You just can't win.

2011
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:04,058
Hi.

2012
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:06,060
Hi.

2013
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,562
Well, look. you brought the asshole.

2014
01:31:10,064 --> 01:31:12,066
My foot hurts.

2015
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:14,068
I think she's ok.

2016
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:19,574
Well, maybe I oughta leave
you ladies alone for a second,

2017
01:31:19,574 --> 01:31:22,076
Go home and grab some clothes.

2018
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:24,078
I'll be back real soon.

2019
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:26,080
Ok.

2020
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,582
Aren't you gonna smell me good-bye?

2021
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:39,093
Better make it 2.

2022
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,594
Yeah.

2023
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:46,601
I think there's hope here.

2024
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:48,069
Yeah.

2025
01:31:55,826 --> 01:31:57,327
You should have called, man.

2026
01:31:57,828 --> 01:31:59,329
You should have called.

2027
01:31:59,330 --> 01:32:02,333
Hal. Hal, we need to talk.

2028
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:03,334
Oh, I don't think

2029
01:32:03,334 --> 01:32:05,336
We need to talk, sweetheart.

2030
01:32:05,336 --> 01:32:07,338
It was never really our thing.

2031
01:32:07,338 --> 01:32:09,340
You can get down on your
knees to me,

2032
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:11,342
I'm still breaking up with you.

2033
01:32:11,342 --> 01:32:12,843
I think you should break up with me.

2034
01:32:13,344 --> 01:32:15,346
Bruce is a hell of a lot
better for you.

2035
01:32:15,346 --> 01:32:16,847
I don't think you understand

2036
01:32:16,847 --> 01:32:18,348
What I'm trying to stay.

2037
01:32:18,349 --> 01:32:19,350
It's over between us,

2038
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:21,351
So don't try and stop me.

2039
01:32:21,352 --> 01:32:22,353
Ok. I won't.

2040
01:32:22,353 --> 01:32:25,356
What happened to us, Hal?

2041
01:32:25,356 --> 01:32:26,357
Aw.

2042
01:32:26,357 --> 01:32:28,359
Where did we go wrong?

2043
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:31,862
I mean, we were going
to buy a dog together!

2044
01:32:31,862 --> 01:32:33,363
A terrier...

2045
01:32:33,364 --> 01:32:35,866
Or maybe--maybe a lab.

2046
01:32:35,866 --> 01:32:37,367
Boy, I sure am lucky

2047
01:32:37,368 --> 01:32:38,869
I found out about you

2048
01:32:38,869 --> 01:32:40,370
Before we wrecked his little life

2049
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:43,874
Or we had to fight
over splitting him up.

2050
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:47,377
Let's not keep Bruce
waiting, all right, honey?

2051
01:32:47,378 --> 01:32:48,379
Yeah.

2052
01:32:48,379 --> 01:32:49,380
Ok.

2053
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:50,881
Bye-bye.

2054
01:32:51,882 --> 01:32:53,383
Don't hate me, Hal.

2055
01:32:53,384 --> 01:32:55,386
Please don't hate me.

2056
01:32:55,386 --> 01:32:58,389
I want you to just
remember the good times.

2057
01:32:58,389 --> 01:33:01,392
I want you to remember
the way we were.

2058
01:33:01,392 --> 01:33:02,393
Ok. I will.

2059
01:33:02,893 --> 01:33:03,393
Bye-bye.

2060
01:33:03,894 --> 01:33:05,395
Thank you, honey.

2061
01:33:07,398 --> 01:33:08,399
Ooh!

2062
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:09,900
Hal!

2063
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,902
Hal, you'll find somebody else!

2064
01:33:11,902 --> 01:33:12,903
I know you will!

2065
01:33:12,903 --> 01:33:14,905
Maybe not right away,

2066
01:33:14,905 --> 01:33:17,407
But in the long run this is best.

2067
01:33:17,408 --> 01:33:20,911
You know, someday
I think you'll thank me.

2068
01:33:24,415 --> 01:33:26,417
It's going to take him a long time

2069
01:33:26,917 --> 01:33:29,419
To get over this.
We're talking years.

2070
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:30,421
Bye.

2071
01:33:30,421 --> 01:33:31,922
Poor dude.

2072
01:33:31,922 --> 01:33:33,924
Bye. bye, Hal!

2073
01:33:36,927 --> 01:33:39,679
Oh, God.

2074
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:41,181
Good morning.

2075
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:43,183
Just the man I need to see.

2076
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:44,685
I need to talk to you.

2077
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:46,186
Sure. Hello, darlin'.

2078
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:47,688
Hi, Mr. Jackson.

2079
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:03,671
Hey. Come here. Come here.
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

2080
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:05,172
Go ahead. Go ahead.

2081
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:06,173
Ma.

2082
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:07,674
What's going on?

2083
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,677
I won a Westinghouse science award.

2084
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:11,679
They only give out 10 each year.

2085
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,180
That's 10 in the whole country.

2086
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,681
Yes, and the principal's
gonna give it to me

2087
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:16,183
Next week at graduation.

2088
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:17,184
Isn't that something?

2089
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:19,686
I'm telling you, This is our baby.

2090
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:21,188
Our baby's getting this award.

2091
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:23,190
Yes, they'll give me
a trophy or something,

2092
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:26,193
And they'll pay for
my whole college tuition.

2093
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:27,695
Congratulations, sweetheart.

2094
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:28,695
That's wonderful.

2095
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:30,197
Thank God.

2096
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,201
How about that, huh?

2097
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:37,704
What's wrong?

2098
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:39,707
Well, I just--

2099
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:42,209
I've just come from
the hematology lab.

2100
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,211
Ooh. Why?

2101
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:47,214
Well, that's where they
keep all our blood.

2102
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:49,216
You're type "A," Sarah.

2103
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:52,219
Sweetheart, they want you
to give some more blood.

2104
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:55,722
You're AB-negative,
And that's kind of rare.

2105
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:58,726
And they took some of mine, too.

2106
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:00,227
And i'm "O."

2107
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:06,734
You couldn't be.

2108
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:11,238
They did it twice, honey,

2109
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:12,739
And i'm "O."

2110
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:16,743
Wait a minute.

2111
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:18,245
What are you sayin'?

2112
01:35:19,747 --> 01:35:21,749
Well, it turns out

2113
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:23,751
That I'm not her father.

2114
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:37,264
But I got the name from mom's file.

2115
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:40,267
They had <i>your</i> name
at the sperm bank.

2116
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:41,768
I know that, sweetheart.

2117
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:43,270
I called.

2118
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:45,272
I talked to the fella

2119
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:46,273
That runs the place.

2120
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:48,775
He said the files were done by hand

2121
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:50,277
Up until about 10 years ago

2122
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,279
When they...

2123
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:53,280
Sent 'em overseas

2124
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,781
To be put on computer disks.

2125
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:57,284
When they came back,
they were messed up.

2126
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:58,785
Well, I jus--

2127
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:01,789
How can they do that to people?

2128
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,792
I'm afraid that the most

2129
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:06,794
You're ever gonna know

2130
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:08,295
Is that the donors came

2131
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:10,297
From the university.

2132
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:12,799
Mostly science majors.

2133
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,807
You're not my father.

2134
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:23,310
No.

2135
01:36:29,316 --> 01:36:31,818
I made a mistake.

2136
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:35,322
I made a horrible, horrible mistake.

2137
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:45,332
Should I go talk to her?

2138
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:46,833
Mm-mmm. No.

2139
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:48,836
She just--she just has to be alone

2140
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:49,837
For a while.

2141
01:36:58,345 --> 01:36:59,846
Well.

2142
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,852
Well.

2143
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:07,354
I guess you probably want to go back

2144
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:08,855
To work or something.

2145
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,861
You probably need your rest, huh?

2146
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:17,865
Yeah.

2147
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:23,870
Ok, then.

2148
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:26,874
I, uh...

2149
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,880
I don't think I thanked you

2150
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:37,384
For being there for Zora and... me.

2151
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:39,886
I wanted to be there.

2152
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:49,897
I got to go to Las Vegas tomorrow.

2153
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:52,900
Ahem. I have a dealer's convention.

2154
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:54,902
Sounds fun.

2155
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:57,404
It's work.

2156
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:00,907
I'll call you when I get back.

2157
01:38:03,911 --> 01:38:05,412
Ok.

2158
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:11,919
Sarah, I'm sorry.

2159
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:18,925
Me, too.

2160
01:38:43,701 --> 01:38:46,954
Hey! Miss Westinghouse award!

2161
01:38:51,959 --> 01:38:52,459
So what'd you get?

2162
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,461
Like free light bulbs and stoves

2163
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:56,463
And microwaves and shit?

2164
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:58,465
Schnobloink.

2165
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:00,467
Thanks.

2166
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:02,969
Hey, what's wrong?

2167
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:06,974
He's not my father, Tea.

2168
01:39:19,486 --> 01:39:21,988
And, you know, the worst part...

2169
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:25,992
Is I wanted a dad.

2170
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:29,997
And he was my dad.

2171
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:34,000
Come here.

2172
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:39,005
I'm sorry, baby.

2173
01:39:41,425 --> 01:39:42,926
Deanna Jordan.

2174
01:39:45,429 --> 01:39:47,431
Erica Franklin.

2175
01:39:49,933 --> 01:39:51,434
Alyssa Penney.

2176
01:39:53,937 --> 01:39:55,438
Sam Fuller.

2177
01:40:01,445 --> 01:40:03,447
Maryilyn Taylor.

2178
01:40:05,949 --> 01:40:07,951
Deke Pruitt.

2179
01:40:07,951 --> 01:40:09,953
Erica Johnson.

2180
01:40:09,953 --> 01:40:10,954
Tina Nichols.

2181
01:40:11,955 --> 01:40:14,457
Horatio Vasquez.

2182
01:40:18,962 --> 01:40:20,964
Thank you, sir.

2183
01:40:20,964 --> 01:40:21,965
Hi, mom!

2184
01:40:22,966 --> 01:40:24,417
Um...

2185
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:28,422
I guess the cool thing
about giving this award is

2186
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:30,924
That I get to give it to my friend.

2187
01:40:30,924 --> 01:40:33,426
Well, my best friend, actually.

2188
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:36,930
Zora's going to M.I.T. this fall.

2189
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:41,435
And I'm sure she's going
to make their heads spin

2190
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:42,936
Just like she did ours.

2191
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:45,439
There are certain people

2192
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:47,941
That just bring out
the best in others,

2193
01:40:48,442 --> 01:40:50,444
And, well, as you all know,

2194
01:40:50,444 --> 01:40:51,445
I ain't one of them peoples.

2195
01:40:55,783 --> 01:40:58,285
But Zora Mathews is,

2196
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:00,787
And that's why I take great pleasure

2197
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:03,290
In presenting this Westinghouse award

2198
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:06,293
To my best friend Zora Mathews.

2199
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:31,318
They said I should say something.

2200
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:33,820
If I've done well in school,

2201
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:35,823
It's because I got
the message at home

2202
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:36,824
That learning was important.

2203
01:41:39,326 --> 01:41:41,328
I'd like to accept this award

2204
01:41:41,829 --> 01:41:43,330
In the name of my mother.

2205
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:48,836
She has made it her life's work

2206
01:41:48,836 --> 01:41:50,337
To educate people.

2207
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:53,840
And I am so lucky
to be one of them.

2208
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:59,346
May we give her the plaque?

2209
01:41:59,346 --> 01:42:01,848
Could you come up, Mrs. Mathews?

2210
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:06,853
Stop it! Stop!

2211
01:42:18,866 --> 01:42:19,867
Excuse me.

2212
01:42:19,867 --> 01:42:20,868
Oh!

2213
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:22,870
Sorry. Excuse me.

2214
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:23,870
I'm sorry.

2215
01:42:24,371 --> 01:42:24,871
Ow!

2216
01:42:25,372 --> 01:42:26,873
Oh! I'm sorry, miss.

2217
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:28,876
Whoa, open-toed shoes.
I'm sorry.

2218
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:29,877
Comin' through.

2219
01:42:30,377 --> 01:42:32,379
Comin' through here.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

2220
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:34,881
Excuse me.

2221
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:49,897
What are you doing here?

2222
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:51,899
I'm not sure.

2223
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,400
I mean...

2224
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,403
I wanted to see...

2225
01:42:56,403 --> 01:42:57,904
You know.

2226
01:42:57,905 --> 01:42:59,907
Your daughter graduate.

2227
01:43:01,408 --> 01:43:01,908

2228
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:02,909
Yeah.

2229
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:04,411
Yeah.

2230
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:07,414
I also thought maybe, uh...

2231
01:43:07,414 --> 01:43:08,915
You might need a hand
going up the stairs.

2232
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:10,917
Oh. Absolutely.

2233
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:11,919
Absolutely.

2234
01:43:30,904 --> 01:43:32,405
This is my mom.

2235
01:43:33,407 --> 01:43:34,908
And...

2236
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:37,911
Your dad.

2237
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:41,415
And my dad.

2238
01:43:59,933 --> 01:44:01,935
