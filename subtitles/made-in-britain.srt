Mr Shahnawaz saw Trevor throw
a brick through his lounge window.

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,748
Mr Shahnawaz was treated by his doctor
for a cut he received...

...but was later able to identify Trevor...

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,357
...when he was apprehended
and arrested by the police.

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,399
Trevor was charged at Ratman Street
police station at 9.45pm.

You've been in court on numerous
occasions for non-attendance.

"Residential" means the place
where you reside, live.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,475
You will reside, live, at Hooper Street
for a period of six weeks...

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,348
...which means you'll probably end up
in there for about six months...

You go straight there and back again.

- It won't take that long.

- Yes, but you'll have to wait in the queue.

- You get me a job, right?
- Yes, but you can't jump the queue.

170

And you're supposed not to
take the cards from the display.

Could you put them back for me?

172
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,316
Tacky jobs, ain't they?

173

If you wait, perhaps
we can sort something out!

Now, take it back. Get rid of it!

- Just a sec. You have to step into line...

...and you have to cooperate.

265
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,753
That shouldn't be too difficult.
We're a reasonable lot.

personal, between the two of us.

<i>I want you to prove to me

273
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,319
Your big break, this.
Cos I'll not give you a second chance.

274
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,072
All right?

275
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,036
- All right.
- Good.

276
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,918
So let's take a look at
what life's got in store for you.

277
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,037
Go back a few steps,
see just how clever you've been so far!

278
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,509
For a kickoff, you've just been to court.
When was it?

279
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,556
Thursday. Yesterday.

280
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,313
Just yesterday?
You've been before, haven't you?

281
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,118
Right?

282
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,998
- Right.
- Still being clever, still being smart.

283
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,436
So what were the most important things
that happened before that?

284
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,476
Can you remember that far back?

285
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,519
You started off here, at home.
H- O-M-E spells home.

286
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,398
There's your mum, your dad,
all the rest of 'em.

287
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,871
And just like any other mum and dad,
all they ask you to do is to go to school.

288
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,190
Now, that's not too much to ask, is it?

289
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,637
You're clever, bright. Everybody wants
you to succeed, nobody wants a failure.

290
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,837
Get the right qualifications,
make your way in the world.

291
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,117
But you didn't want to go to school,
did you? You knew best!

292
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,351
So you started bunking off -
out the gate, over the fence.

293
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,512
And your teachers are concerned,
cos they're there to help.

294
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,309
They don't want to see you get behind.
So they go and see your mum and dad.

295
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,518
<i>- No teacher's ever been to my house.
- They still talked to your mum and dad.</i>

296
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,718
And they told you to get your arse back
into school! But you still didn't listen.

297
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,997
Out the gate, over the fence.
Before you know where you are...

298
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,470
...your mum and dad get a visit
from the education welfare officer!

299
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,630
- Got a visit from him, didn't you?
- Yeah.

300
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,109
The EWO's there
to make sure you go to school...

301
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,316
...or he tells the appropriate authority.

302
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,356
And that spells trouble!

303
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,879
Now, at this point,
a lot of kids get a bit of sense.

304
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,999
They get themselves together,
they get back to school, they listen.

305
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,036
But you didn't listen, did you?

306
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,398
The education welfare officer visits
four, five, six, even seven times...

307
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,755
...tries to help, discover the problem.

308
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,391
<i>A lot of time and expense - and all
because you don't want to go to school!</i>

309
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,116
The EWO reaches his limit,
so he sends your parents a letter...

310
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,397
...threatening to take you to court
for non-attendance...

311
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,199
...but that does nothing -
absolutely nothing.

312
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,350
So there's a summons.

313
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,797
And you go for the very first time to court.
Your debut!

314
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,431
First appearance -
send him home for a test attendance...

315
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,636
...for whatever good that'll do!

316
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,553
You're supposed to go to school
for 21 days straight...

317
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,349
...but you foul up after the third
or fourth day and back you go again.

318
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,034
So... One, two, three, four, five...

319
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,076
...six breaks.

320
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,869
Six chances to get yourself straight,
get your arse back into school...

321
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,916
...and one, two, three, four, five...

322
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,116
...six times you've blown it.

323
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,393
- Now, am I not right?
- Yeah.

324
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,996
But you weren't just bunking off. You had
to do summat with all that free time.

325
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,036
So you did a bit of thieving.

326
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,079
First two or three times you get caught,
you get taken down the nick...

327
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,072
...and some policeman tells you off,
shouts at you.

328
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,915
Next time you get a caution - this time
a sergeant in full uniform shouts at you.

329
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,470
But that doesn't make a damn bit
of difference, you're deaf to reason.

330
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,791
You go on nicking and making
a bloody nuisance of yourself...

331
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,553
...when you should be here,
learning summat useful!

332
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,553
But it's burglary, shoplifting, TDA -
touching the dog's arse...

333
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,030
...taking and driving away -
and back you go to court.

334
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,876
They're getting to know you now...

335
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,350
...so you get fined, or sent to
the police attendance centre.

336
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,715
Kept off the streets all day Saturday...

337
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,998
...made to scrub floors when you could be
watching West Ham lose at home.

338
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,799
The magistrates don't know
what to do with you.

339
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,394
They're all greengrocers
and shopkeepers.

340
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,040
So... they send you here to us...

341
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,350
...for... assessment.

342
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,996
So, what are we going to do with you?

343
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,953
- We could recommend you go home...
- What home?

344
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,794
...but they won't have you.
So how are we going to get rid of you?

345
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,155
Foster parents? Never.
Children's home? A joke.

346
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,672
CHE, detention centre, borstal.

347
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,150
Well, a pity about CHE,
Community Home with Education...

348
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,995
...appealing both to your intellectual
brilliance and your public spirit.

349
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,719
What used to be called
an approved school, a CHE.

350
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,836
You could have been king of the Mafia!

351
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,390
Lots of lick-my-arse power trips
around vicious 15-year-olds...

352
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,869
...and you've just turned 16! Bad luck.

353
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,916
Not much left to bring you in line.

354
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,470
Short, sharp shock at the local
detention centre, or borstal!

355
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,116
Two simple lessons
you'll have to learn, DC or borstal.

356
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,839
One - discipline,
two - respect for authority.

357
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,196
You're gonna have to learn it,
so you might as well learn it now.

358
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,715
This is an open invitation to you to
cooperate, Trevor. For your own good.

359
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,471
DC - seven out of ten
coming out of detention centres...

360
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,634
<i>... eight out of ten from borstals re-offend,
commit crimes, that is, within two years.</i>

361
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,792
So, here you are, fresh out of borstal.

362
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,758
What's the first thing
you're going to need? Peter?

363
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,319
A job.

364
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,119
Peter, how many unemployed
do we have at the moment?

365
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,156
- Millions.
- Exactly.

366
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,755
So what chance have you got,
with your record, of getting a job...

367
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,150
...against a lad with O and A levels
and a decent haircut?

368
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,071
About nil?

369
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,628
Optimistic. So, no job.

370
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,676
What do you do? Sign on. The dole.

371
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,276
How much is that worth to you?

372
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,194
A place to live, food in your gut,
a bit of fun? Nothing. It's gone, broke.

373
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,238
No job, no prospects, no cash.

374
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,116
So what do you do?

375
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,239
And you're back here - all because you
were too stupid when you were here...

376
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,595
...nicking sweets from the local tuck shop.

377
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,276
Well, they've tried all this.
They know this didn't work, not with you.

378
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,316
So what's left?

379
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,991
And you're on the bandwagon, boy.
And you won't get off.

380
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,230
Prison: Locked up like an animal!

381
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,231
A job: No prospects.

382
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,276
Dole: No cash.

383
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,316
Thieving: No more chances.

384
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,356
Prison: An animal.

385
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,749
Round and round you go.

386
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,638
Well, those are your options.
You've created 'em.

387
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,715
You've brought it all upon yourself.

388
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,595
Before you kick another door down...

389
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,831
...before you kick another chef
in the bollocks...

390
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,275
...before you do anything...

391
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,476
...think!

392
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,516
You may not get another chance.

393
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,070
Settle down.
We'll have another little chat on Monday.

394
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,595
Sounds great. When do I start?

395
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,992
It doesn't have to be like that, Trevor.
There are alternatives, brighter prospects.

396
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,550
<i>You lot are all the same - all first names.
"How about that, Trevor?"</i>

397
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,710
You make out like you know me.

398
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,756
<i>- I know some things, Trevor.
- Trevor!</i>

399
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,718
I know you're intelligent.
It's on all your reports.

400
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,756
You say that like it's a present.

401
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,115
I'm not trying to be patronising.

402
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,919
Look, what do you expect me to be?
Thick in the head?

403
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,956
<i>- Trevor...
- Trevor!</i>

404
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,157
<i>- (man) You've found your tongue now!
- Bollocks.</i>

405
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,708
- You can walk out of this room now...
- Where to?

406
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,678
...but you must behave responsibly.
- Grow up.

407
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,356
No more violence, and start using some of
the intelligence you're supposed to have.

408
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,433
Bollocks. Piss off! I hate you,
the fuckin' pair of you! I hate you!

409
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,830
I don't know you, Trevor. You don't
know me. So how can you hate me?

410
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,275
- For putting me in here.
- You put yourself in here.

411
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,113
Look, you go kicking doors down,
breaking the place up...

412
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,394
I'm British!

413
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,118
So?

414
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,475
- Know what that means, do you?
- I think so.

415
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,869
- You proud to be British?
- What do you mean?

416
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,916
Don't you know? I'm proud.

417
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,230
I don't really think about it like that.

418
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,438
That's cos you've spent too much time
locked up in here with all these niggers.

419
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,830
Oh, I see.
British bulldog, one, two, three.

420
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,876
I'm more British than you, fuck-face.

421
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,428
You hate blacks as much as I do,
but don't admit it.

422
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,116
You hate them more,
cos they frighten you.

423
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,350
- That's why you lock 'em up.
- Watch it.

424
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,510
You lock up anything that frightens you!

425
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,068
The only thing that frightens me, Trevor...

426
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,073
...are the people who put sick ideas
like that into children's heads.

427
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,039
<i>- Trevor, this is not a prison.
- (Trevor) It's just the same as school.</i>

428
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,429
Do what we tell you,
think what we tell you...

429
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,159
...say what we tell you,
squawk, be a fuckin' parrot!

430
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,196
I hate you for putting me in here!

431
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,835
You're bullshitters! You swallow your own
bollocks, you expect me to swallow it too.

432
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,356
Blacks in here are as thick as shit
with no brains! You know it.

433
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,638
Admit it. I had to sit in school and watch
these wankers add up on their fingers.

434
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,280
I was held back.
All the white kids were held back!

435
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,830
And that's why you spend your time
attacking canteen managers?

436
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,876
It's all the fault of the blacks?

437
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,999
- Pakis don't even speak fuckin' English!
- Well, send them back(!)

438
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,275
- Now, come on.
- It's not cruel. It would be kind!

439
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,557
That why you threw a brick
through Mr Whatshisname's window?

440
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,596
Every Paki's gonna get one.

441
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,592
And shit, and piss, and petrol.
Wait till it starts!

442
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,752
- Proud of all this, are you?
- If I watch my p's and q's...

443
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,515
...cos some mingy little fucker like you
is gonna write it all down!

444
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,479
"Your case conference is coming up.
Watch your step." Bollocks!

445
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,350
I'll say what I want. You got decisions
to make about my life, you get on with it.

446
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,436
I hate you for putting me in here.

447
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,479
<i>- One day you'll fuckin' pay for it.
- (Peter) We didn't put you in here.</i>

448
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,518
You put yourself in here.
We're trying to get you out.

449
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,318
Out where?

450
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,039
Out of this room, out of this place.
Back into the world.

451
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,271
It's your fuckin' world, mate, not mine!
Stick it up your arse!

452
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,478
- Come on, Peter, let's have a drink.
- Can't you take a bit of honesty?

453
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,516
<i>I wouldn't have said that honesty
was one of your finer points.</i>

454
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,875
<i>(Peter) Just a minute.
Can I say something?</i>

455
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,873
Trevor, just a minute. That's all.
Let's just cool it, shall we?

456
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,549
This is a bad start. But there's no need
for it to go on like this, no reason at all.

457
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,996
What you have to remember is,
this is just a temporary situation.

458
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,959
You could be out of here in no time.
You're here for assessment, that's all.

459
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,474
That means we want to help you
to help yourself.

460
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,870
Now, it needn't be like that.
There are alternatives.

461
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,673
If it goes well, you could be
out of here in... three or four weeks.

462
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,354
There are youth projects.
You could travel.

463
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,955
Apprentice boarding schools,
choose a trade... Loads of things.

464
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,031
<i>It needn't be like that.</i>

465
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,238
While you're here there's pocket money.
Want new clothes? You can have them.

466
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,949
There are trips planned. Christ,
it's not as bad as you make it sound!

467
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,918
But there has to be some kind of
understanding between us.

468
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,992
- Why were you looking at your watch?
- I wasn't.

469
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,789
- Counting the hairs on your arms?
- There's a lot you can enjoy, Trevor.

470
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,714
Horse riding, canoeing... A lot better
than sitting in this bloody room!

471
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,870
What about fucking?

472
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,918
A man comes round every Thursday
to fuck some sense into...

473
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,070
- You on that one, are you?
- Peter, please.

474
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,312
Let's concentrate on getting out of here.
We can sort out the world tomorrow.

475
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,393
- I'm not signing any contract.
- OK, well, forget about the contract.

476
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,349
All it means is cooperation, and that's
what's important, cos I'll tell you...

477
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,512
...if we don't sort out something -
and soon - all that...

478
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,831
...all that bloody mess up there
will be the only options left.

479
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,195
- There'll be no more help from us.
- Great.

480
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,589
And you'll be a total bloody failure. At 16.

481
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,195
- And it's such a bloody waste.
- I'm a success. I'm a fuckin' star!

482
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,236
Then why are you in here, Trevor?

483
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,551
There are those among us
who'd like to know the answer to that...

484
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,518
...and from where I'm standing,
it's not looking too good.

485
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,558
I'm in exactly the right place
at the right time.

486
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,594
The fact that you're too fuckin' thick or
stupid to see that, that marks you down.

487
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,956
You'll be put up against a bus,
covered in petrol, and shot!

488
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,271
- Fantastic.
- All of you! It's you that's fuckin' failed!

489
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,635
I'm not your bleeding problem
or anyone's!

490
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,676
Bollocks to you and your report!

491
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,399
Write it, lock me up. Who gives a fuck?

492
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:41,918
I don't know. But what are we gonna do?

493
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,950
- About what?
- About you.

494
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,508
<i>No, what the fuck
are we gonna do about you?</i>

495
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,471
If you had any balls, you'd stick a knife
in the bastards who write all that bollocks!

496
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,438
They're just like teachers at school -
fuckin' wankers!

497
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,600
- You learn anything at school, did you?
- Yeah.

498
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,989
- Be the best, otherwise forget it.
- That it?

499
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,036
Everything they teach you is useless.

500
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,999
- Everything?
- Rubbish. Bugger all to do with my life.

501
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,036
That's what you learned at school?

502
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,477
Work hard, do well, get a job, otherwise
you're no good, you're a vandal.

503
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,711
That's what I learned.
It's a lot of bollocks. Lies!

504
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,916
We're all fucking great.

505
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,472
You ain't taking bugger all from us.
We hate you.

506
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,393
You can lock me in here, but you can't
take away the hate inside my head.

507
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,436
Don't like that, do you?

508
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,709
You can't take a bit of truth, can you?

509
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,475
Oh, I don't think you're
particularly truthful. Or honest.

510
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,436
No, you lie with the best of them!

511
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,635
You go out thieving,
and that's not particularly honest.

512
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,111
Perhaps school would be a better place
if people like you were more honest.

513
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,555
You believe that not nicking from school...

514
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,518
...or from the local Paki sweet shop bit,
don't you?

515
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,795
- That's being honest, innit?
- Yes, it is.

516
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,348
- You don't really want me to be honest.
- Yes, I do.

517
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,557
Well, honestly speaking,
I don't think I can keep the peace...

518
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,838
...while I'm incarcerated in this shithouse
or any other shithouse - contract...

519
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,878
...or no contract,
so there's no point in saying I will!

520
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,520
- How's that for honesty?
- But where's it getting us?

521
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,875
It's not getting us
out of this bloody room.

522
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,511
See? You can't take it. It's the same when
I was at school. I said when I was bored...

523
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,750
...when I didn't want to do a lesson...

524
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,038
...when I wanted to tell the teacher
to fuck off, or kick him in the teeth.

525
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,795
But they couldn't take it. They didn't
want me to be honest in that way.

526
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,917
That's why they don't teach honesty.
9.00-10.30- honesty!

527
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,037
They don't want the kids to say
what they're really thinking.

528
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,714
If they had lessons like that,
they'd lose control!

529
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,270
Wouldn't be able to smack you
round the head when they feel like it.

530
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,352
You just want me to be honest
when you take me down the nick.

531
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,396
"It's a fair cop, guv."

532
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,393
Or when I fill out a form. "Be honest,
don't cheat, don't carry a knife."

533
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,029
"Bend over, let me search you, make
notes about you, keep files on you."

534
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,475
If I'm honest,
I've got nothing to worry about.

535
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,155
You're protecting me from
the dishonest buggers, ain't ya?

536
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,196
<i>But I can't look at the files.</i>

537
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,717
What's read out by the magistrate, what
those fuckers said about me at school...

538
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,598
...what's on the police computer -
it's all bollocks!

539
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,990
We're not talking about honesty,
it's sticking to the rules!

540
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,117
All those honest people
are just sticking to the rules...

541
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,475
...but they lie and fuckin' cheat
all the way!

542
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,710
<i>They just think they're being honest...</i>

543
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,998
...cos they swallowed the bollocks they've
been handed. They've been conned!

544
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,036
Well, I've not been conned.

545
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,679
That's why you can stick
your hairy contract up your hairy arse!

546
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,716
It's a dishonest con!

547
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,360
If you want to put me in line... well, do it.

548
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,913
Try it. Don't fucking lie about it.

549
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,515
Kick me in the bollocks if you like,
cos I'll do the same to you!

550
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,556
So good night and fuck off!

551
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,835
Good night to you too! Peter, I'm going.

552
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,876
Er, just, er...

553
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,676
Just a minute, Barry!

554
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,235
Forget it. He's a sod, he's psychotic.

555
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,869
Have him transferred to a secure unit.
Let someone else deal with it.

556
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,758
Harry Parker dropped this one on us.
Let's chuck it back.

557
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,150
He has no intention of keeping the peace.
Let's have him locked up.

558
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,550
- Give Parker a call.
- Do you really think it's worth it?

559
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,036
<i>(keys jangle)</i>

560
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,669
This one opens my office. The small one's
to the top drawer in my desk.

561
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,314
You'll find my address book.
Parker, under P.

562
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,755
It's a waste of time.

563
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,353
Yeah.

564
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,311
- Want to go to the toilet?
- No, I'll piss on the wall.

565
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,760
We're gonna have to send you
to Hatchmere House.

566
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,197
- Secure unit. Under lock and key.
- Great. It's where I'm going anyway.

567
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,556
Anything you care about?

568
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,876
If I told you, you'd confiscate it.

569
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,195
Same every night.

570
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,236
Late tomorrow.

571
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,312
No-one cares about
your little protest, Trevor.

572
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,356
No-one gives a damn.

573
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,194
It's totally insignificant -
just you in this horrible room.

574
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,912
Yeah.

575
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,832
Right.

576
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,956
Barry Giller and I may not be much...

577
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,716
...but we're all there is.

578
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,956
No-one else gives a sod.

579
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,035
Going banger-racing tomorrow night.

580
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,634
Why not drag yourself along?
You're into cars.

581
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,518
Take the social services
for all they've got, eh?

582
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,629
Better than sitting around in this hole.

583
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,996
Who wants to watch a bunch of wankers
smashing up cars?

584
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,036
Oh, me for one. I quite enjoy it.

585
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,396
One of the lads entered.

586
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,436
It's part of a project.

587
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,916
Leroy. He's...

588
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,316
- He's a good driver.
- And a nigger.

589
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,836
I'll go if I can drive.

590
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,992
Yeah. Well, a cut above
cruising in a Ford Granada!

591
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,916
Accessory.

00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,358
Out!

745
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,918
Move!

746
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,796
Bollocks!

747
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,796
<i>(driver honking horn)</i>

749
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,275
Wanker!

750
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,316
Fucking wanker!

751
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,471
<i>(man #1) Hello? Who is it?</i>

752
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,915
<i>(man #2) Hello? Second floor. Come up.</i>

753
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,831
<i>(entry buzzer)</i>

754
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,476
Oi, oi! You up early, missus?

755
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,156
<i>(raps on door)</i>

756
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,316
<i>(belches) What you looking at?</i>

757
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,673
<i>- (man) Just a minute! Hey, excuse me!
- Get in and shut it!</i>

758
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,035
Sorry about that, Mr Driver. Sorry, John.

759
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,271
I thought it was the taxi for the airport.
I'm sorry.

760
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,596
You nerd!

761
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,275
- You going away, Harry?
- In there! And keep your voice down.

762
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,796
You going on holiday, Harry?

763
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,914
What do you want, Trevor?
What's going on?

764
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,956
I'm turning myself in.

765
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,998
<i>- (woman) Harry! Harry?
- What do you mean?</i>

766
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,196
Wait there, and don't make a noise!

767
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,956
<i>(Harry) Oi!</i>

768
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,956
<i>- Up the Yids!
- (Harry) Out!</i>

769
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,468
You wake him up
and I'm going to boot your arse.

770
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,599
I didn't get to bed till one, so I've had
bugger all sleep. So watch it, right?

771
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,636
Now, what's going on?

772
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,154
<i>I had a bust-up with those wankers
you put me with.</i>

773
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,118
Where you put yourself!
I kept you out of there for months.

774
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,156
You're pissing off on your holidays.

775
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,518
If you can't cope for two weeks, you're not
worth a toss. When did you bunk off?

776
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,158
About one.

777
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,435
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

778
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,353
Take my advice
and bunk back in before it's too late.

779
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,715
- I bust the Jobcentre window.
- What?

780
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,036
- When?
- Friday.

781
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,635
- But I only took you in there Thursday.
- They don't know I did it.

782
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,870
- The assessment centre?
- Yeah.

783
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,916
But you're telling me.

784
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,716
- Yeah.
- Great!

785
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,756
<i>(boy) Is it time yet, Dad?</i>

786
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,513
Not yet, Terry.
I'll tell you when it's time to go.

787
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,953
Hello, Tel!

788
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,116
Back to bed - I'm working. Come on!

789
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,033
- I nicked the Transit from the centre.
- When?

790
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,395
- Tonight.
- What else?

791
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,075
Me and Errol chucked bricks
through Mr Shahnawanker's window.

792
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,754
<i>- (girl) Mum!
- Shit!</i>

793
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,835
<i>(Terry) Annie wants to go to the toilet!</i>

794
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,196
- Viv!
- All right!

795
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,756
Mr who? Whose windows?

796
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,115
That Paki bastard who had me put away.

797
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,556
- Did you do Harrods' windows too(?)
- I didn't think of that.

798
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,596
Who's?

799
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,272
Who's Errol?

800
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,316
A nig-nog. From the centre.

801
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,995
I dumped him in the Transit
at the police station. I turned him in.

802
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,390
- Is that all?
- Yeah. Ah... no.

803
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,869
I pissed on my files in the centre.

804
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,876
Errol shit on his.

805
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,993
I'm turning myself in to you, as you're
my mate. You can collect the reward!

806
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,360
Where did you leave Errol
and the Transit?

807
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,996
What police station?

808
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,474
- One near Bradley Street School.
- Crapping on your own doorstep!

809
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,510
- We'll let them deal with it.
- They'll stand on me, Harry.

810
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,194
They don't like me there.
I've been there before.

811
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,475
They'll roll me in a mattress
and boot me.

812
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:48,920
What's that to a brick shithouse like you?

813
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,639
I smashed a police car with the Transit.

814
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,750
Send me to another nick.

815
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,636
Your shit. You roll in it!

816
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,996
<i>(ringing tone)</i>

817
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,716
You're an arsehole, Trevor.

818
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,756
You're not worth a piss!

819
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,752
Right.

820
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,756
Like my file!

821
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,396
<i>(continuous buzzing)</i>

822
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,356
<i>(flap opens)</i>

823
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,839
Take your finger off that bleeding buzzer!

824
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,276
<i>(buzzing stops)</i>

825
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,309
- What do you want?
- Can you flush the toilet? I done a crap!

826
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,436
<i>(buzzing)</i>

827
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,076
<i>(buzzing continues)</i>

828
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,195
<i>(buzzing stops)</i>

829
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,358
Now, I told you to keep
your hand off that buzzer!

830
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,271
I'm a juvenile offender.
You can't keep me in a cell.

831
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,073
I know you.

832
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,718
Do ya?

833
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,314
I've been charged.
You can't keep me in the cell.

834
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:42,076
- You got to send me back to the centre.
- Shut your mouth, will you? Just shut it.

835
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,756
You got to look after me!

836
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,630
Gimme something to eat.

837
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,551
You see this?

838
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:51,995
Sit down and shut your fuckin' rabbit.

839
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,316
- PC Anson.
- Shut it!

840
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,391
You're straight into court Monday.

841
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,040
And you ain't going back
to no assessment centre.

842
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,795
You're going straight
to a detention centre. Or borstal.

843
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,873
And when you come out, we're gonna be
waiting outside the gate for you...

844
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,873
...and we're gonna put you in a car
and bring you straight back down here.

845
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,948
And we're gonna take your fingerprints.

846
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,428
<i>We can't do that now, juvenile offender...</i>

847
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,718
...but once you've been to a DC or borstal,
we can screw you - and we will.

848
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,556
<i>We got you now.</i>

849
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:54,916
Once we have your prints, we'll do you for
every unsolved taking and driving away...

850
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,993
...in this district, stretching back
over months - and that's a lot of cars!

851
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,952
And you'll go down and you'll stay down
for years. We'll see to that.

852
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,196
Sounds great!

853
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,630
You think you're hard, don't you?

854
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,916
A lot of verbals.

855
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,880
There's two things you're going to learn!

856
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,028
At home, at school...

857
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,395
...at work, in the street...

858
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:42,679
...you will respect authority and you will
obey the rules, just like everybody else!

859
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,316
That's discipline!

860
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,512
Most kids know that
by the time they reach your age.

861
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,038
Shut it!

862
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,076
And keep it shut!

863
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,276
