What about boxing?

20
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,000
you told me that if you
didn't have a winning record
after 11 fights,

21
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,880
that you'd be happy
to talk to max
concerning the job.

22

It was a draw

That's not
a winning record.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,600
it's not
a losing record.
Bob, that's
not what you said.

78
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
as you can see,
i've decided to improvise a bit.

79
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,640
the basic concept is now
a surprise around every corner.

have to hit me.

and i don't wanna know.

146
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,520
as far as i'm concerned,
you're a good kid.

147
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,920
i got news, though.
Without you here,
i can't keep on your friend.

148
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
i got enough people
pretendin' to sweep.

149
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,240
just do me a favor,
arthur, please.

150
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,160
he's done a lot for me
when i was younger.

151
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,000
just keep him on until i can
figure out what's happening.
All right?  Please?

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
i'll do what i can, bobby.
I'd appreciate it.

I'm gonna take care

the money.

156
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,520

157
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,440
you have my word.
Is that enough?

158
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,240

you talk too much.

159
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,640

162
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,400
you like the ponies?

163
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
yeah, sure.
You bet ponies?

164
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
ye--  n-no.
Not really.

165
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,600
oh, smart.  They're hard
as hell to handicap.

166
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,960
you know what
i like?  Jai alai.

167
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,320
with the--
yeah.  You know
why i like it?

168
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
it's fixed.

169
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,640
sure thing.  That's
the only way to win.

170
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
you see
that horse there?

171
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,360
the blaze.
This one.
This one here?

172
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,760
yeah, yeah.  I bought
the horse in '66.

173
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
i hired a trainer,
stall, whatever.

174
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,560
that horse
made me $100,000.

175
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,960
in sixties dollars
you know what that is?

176
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,840
yeah, it's, uh--  yeah.
It's a lot of money.
A million, easy.

177
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,720
a lot of money, yeah.
Must have been
some fast horse.

178
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,600
it never won a race.

179
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
it got me in good
with the trainer.
Sit down.

180
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,240
attaboy.

181
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,160
yeah, the trainer and i,
we had a thing.

182
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
i don't remember
what it was.
Some fuckin' thing.

183
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,920
the jockey would raise
the fuckin' whip...

184
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,800
and whatever
the fuck it was.

185
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,680
we had a good thing.
But, you know, this one
tells that one.

186
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,080
the other one
tells another one,
and before you know it,

187
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,000
the whole world,
everybody's in on it.

188
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,840
that's what you call
the smart money, right?

189
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,200
yeah, yeah, that's--

190
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,080
yeah,
that's the smart money.

191
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,480
bobby, i like you.

192
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,800
why do you make it so hard
for me to take care of you?

193
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,680
max, i swear to god,
these guys were outta line.

194
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,560
no, no.  You know,
maybe last time
with the puerto ricans.

195
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
these were nice
jewish boys.
They were outta line.

196
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,800
bobby, i love jessica just like
she's my flesh and blood.

197
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,160
i would kill anyone
if they as much as laid
a finger on her...

198
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,080
or her beautiful daughter.

199
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,920
but that fuckin'pisher
that you socked
in the teeth...

200
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,680
has the most expensive dentist
in beverly hills, wants i should
buy him an implant.

201
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,000
your gorilla horseshit
cost me eight grand.
Okay.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
if it's money,
i'll work it off.

203
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,280
you know i'm good
for it.
Not drivin' jessica,
you won't.

204
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,600
what are you talkin' about?
Two strikes,
bobby.

205
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,920
and the second one
was big.

206
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
the bachelor's father,
he belongs to my shul.

207
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,640
so... What?  That's it?

208
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
i'm out.
It's over.

209
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,440
did i say that?
No.  I don't know.
What do you--

210
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,840
i'm sayin' it's my fault.

211
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,160
i'm sendin' you out
to watch scum drool over
the love of your life,

212
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,080
and then i wonder
why you see red?

213
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,440
it's my fault.
The tooth is on me,
but no more.

214
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,760
- i'm reassignin' you.
- uh--  n-no, no.

215
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
i don't wanna drive
another girl.

216
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,600
the only reason i'm workin' here
is because i wanna be around--

217
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,480
hey, is this
a fuckin' democracy?

218
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,840
who the fuck do you think
you're talkin' to?

219
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,760
you want out?

220
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,640
do i put food
on your table?

221
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,960
i sponsor your training.
I take care of your girl
and her little baby.

222
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,800
i even pay for that
deadbeat friend of yours...

223
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
for pushin' a goddamn broom.

224
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,000
yeah, yeah, you're right.
So are you ready
to sit down and listen?

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,400
sit down!

226
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,320
sit down and hear!

227
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,600
can you hear now?
Yeah.

228
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,400
i think i got somethin'
that'll make everybody happy.

229
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,280
i work with a guy
named ruiz.

230
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,200
i want you
to go with him,

231
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
accompany him
on a drop.

232
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,520
he's got his own men.
You're just scenery.

233
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,360
i want a big guinea
with a busted face
hangin' around as a deterrent.

234
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,240
you go,
i'll take care of you.

235
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
and we're square
on the tooth.

236
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,040
i--  it--
what about ricky?

237
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,960
he would jump
at an opportunity
to do this.

238
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,280
ricky?  Ricky
"i lost the truck" ricky?

239
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,600
i--  you said you liked him.
You wanted to work with him.

240
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,960
that was before he lost
my carpet-cleaning van.

241
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
okay.  Let me talk to him.
He'll work it off.

242
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,160
jesus.  You know,
i don't know the kid.

243
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,560
the little that i know
about him scares me.

244
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,960
i grew up with him.
He's a good guy.

245
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,320
uh-huh.  Well,
you vouch for him?

246
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,200
i-i-i grew up with the guy.
Uh-huh.

247
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,600
you vouch for him?

248
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,480
do i--
you mean, do i--
do you vouch for him?

249
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,200
um, he--  yeah.
Yeah, of course i vouch for him.

250
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
how about this?

251
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,520
you're in, he's in.

252
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
i don't--

253
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,280
you're beatin' people up.
You might as well
get paid for it.

254
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
think about it.

255
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,960
you gotta take that guy out.
You own that guy.
You own him.  Come on!

256
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,880
we need guns.
He didn't say
anything about guns.

257
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
he implied something
about guns, i'm sure.

258
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,680
it's not something
you imply.  It's something
you lay out on the table.

259
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,560
he didn't say anything
about guns.  Besides,
i'm not taking the job.

260
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,960
it's the opportunity
of a lifetime, bobby.
You nuts?

261
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,360
you've been waiting
for this opportunity.

262
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,240
no,you'vebeen waiting
for this opportunity.
You're damn straight.

263
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
you think i like livin'
on fuckin' yucca?

264
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,560
you do good
on something like this,
and then you're in.

265
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,480
you have opportunities
after that.
What about boxing?

266
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,400
bobby, you're outta
your mind.
Oh, you're full of shit.

267
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,280
i clowned with you
for two fuckin' rounds,
did this shit.
Oh, stop.

268
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,680
it was a fuckin' draw.
I didn't train for the fight!
That was horseshit!

269
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,080
you're not gonna be
a professional boxer!
Let's do it right now.

270
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,480
i'm not talkin'
about fighting.
You'll never be a boxer.

271
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
come on.  Right now.
Don't start fuckin' pushin' me.
Fuck you, man!

272
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
let's do it.
Don't be a fuckin' child.
Don't be a fuckin' child!

273
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,640
ricky!  Bobby!
Cut that shit out!
Sorry, coach.

274
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
how's the boxing going?

275
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,880
really good, coach.
Yeah, really good.
He's five, five and one.

276
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,280
stick with it, bobby.
You know it takes time.

277
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,680
you always had
the heart.

278
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,560
how 'bout me, coach?
Did i always have heart?

279
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
what are you
gawkin' at, ladies?

280
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,840
this is not recess.

281
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
run a play.
Let's run a play.

282
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,120
fuck him.  You'd think
he'd let it go after a while.

283
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,960
the fact is we probably
could've beat fairfax
if you hadn't got suspended.

284
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,360
whatever, man.
Fuckin' asshole.

285
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,280
i mean, t-shirts?
Really.
I liked those shirts.

286
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
you never wore
those shirts?
We could have bought them.

287
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,120
i almost got suspended
over that shit.

288
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,960
thank god you took the bullet
for me and didn't say anything.
I appreciate it.

289
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
want a hit?
Nah, man, i gotta
pick up the baby.

290
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,720
why you always get stuck
pickin' up the kid?
I like it, okay?

291
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
it's not even your kid.
You want a lift, or you
wanna stay here and walk?

292
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,000
that looks great.

293
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,840
i don't know why we don't
get a drink instead of
sittin' inside this place.

294
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
i promised chloe
we'd come here.

295
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,600
she doesn't even know
where she is, bob.

296
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,520
she'd have more fun
if we were at boardner's.

297
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,360
she could play
the trivia game or the little
racing game thing she does.

298
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,240
she's a little girl.
Little girls don't like
to go to bars.

299
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
we had fun.
We went to bars
when we were kids.

300
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,560
and all the different people,
right?  Remember slimmy?

301
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,920
excuse me, sir.
There's no smoking
allowed in the store.

302
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
why, you serving food?
No, it's store policy.

303
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,680
and you can't sit
at a station unless
you purchase a ceramic.

304
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,000
can you believe this shit?
I can't sit at a station
without purchasing a ceramic?

305
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,920
why don't you bring me
an ashtray, then?

306
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,280
can i color me that,
a ceramic ashtray?
Right away.

307
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,560
and what color paints
can i get you?
I don't know.

308
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,880
surprise me.
I'm not sure what
i'm feeling today.

309
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
now, listen to me.

310
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,120
i think maxie's starting
to reach out to you
with this thing,

311
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,040
and it's not something
that you should let slip by.

312
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,960
what's wrong, baby?
He's not doing it.

313
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,880
what is
she saying?
He's not painting.

314
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,760
-i'm gonna paint
when i get my paints.
- there you go.

315
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,040
there's a nice way
to do that.
Will you paint?

316
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,920
maxie won't let me drive jess
anymore.
Who's he have
drivin' her?

317
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,800
i don't know.  I don't know
what he's got goin' on.

318
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,200
- isn't it fun?
- what's that, sweetie?

319
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,120
isn't it fun?
What's that?

320
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,040
isn't it fun?
What fun?

321
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,400
isn't it fun to paint?
To paint?
Yeah.  I love it.

322
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,760
really calms me down.
Frogs aren't purple,
by the way.

323
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,640
have you ever seen
a purple frog?
You have?

324
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,040
when you were asleep?
Why you giving her
a hard time?

325
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,440
this is a good opportunity.
If we play this right--

326
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,840
i don't want anything.
He's a sketchy character.

327
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,680
i don't wanna talk about him
in front of the "aby-bay".
Okay, let's drop it.

328
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,080
let's drop it.
Let's "ex-nay"
on the "bex-nay".

329
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
"ig-pay atin-lay".
Can you "ut-shay"
your "outh-may? "

330
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,920
"ain-saying-ay".
You're doing it wrong.

331
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,320
i don't understand
what you're saying.
"onch-pay oo-bay".

332
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,160
"ay-bay,
ay-way".
"ax-may"
your "ass-ay".

333
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,480
"ut-shay" your "ace-fay",
"asshole-ay".

334
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,840
did you hear that?
Did you hear
what he said?

335
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
what do you
think of that?

336
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,200
-here you go, sweetie.
- i don't want grilled cheese.

337
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,560
you love
grilled cheese.
I hate cheese.

338
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,440
come on, sweetie.
Mommy's in a hurry.
Don't be a little shit, okay?

339
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,360
hey, hon?
Yeah.

340
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,280
i'll fix her dinner.
Go get ready.

341
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,680
you sure?
Thanks, sweetie.
Yeah.

342
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,560
bobby's going to
fix you something, okay?
I love you.

343
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,880
- you're not my daddy.
- you wanna bust my horns?

344
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,800
or do you want
some spaghetti?

345
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,080
- i want spaghettis.
- of course.  It's your
favorite food, right?

346
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,440
yep.
I want you to watch me
very carefully,

347
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,320
so you'll learn
how to cook.

348
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,680
you don't know how to cook,
you eat in restaurants
every day.

349
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,560
you don't wanna do that,
because cooks in restaurants
scratch their ass...

350
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,920
and they touch the food,
and it's no good,
it's not clean.

351
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,280
there's things you wanna
spend your money on instead
of restaurants, right?

352
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,640
what do you want
to spend your money on?
Turtles...

353
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,560
turtles.
And stuff
that i care about.

354
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,480
what do you
care about?

355
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,880
i care about getting...

356
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,200
food for my pets and...

357
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,120
feeding them
every day.

358
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,480
that's right.  Feeding them
every day.  If you don't feed
the animals, what happens?

359
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,880
they die.
They die,
right?

360
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,240
this is called
pasta puttanesca.
You know what that means?

361
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,120
that means
bad girl's pasta,

362
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,040
and there's
only enough for one.

363
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,400
that means you get to eat it.
That means i gotta eat
a grilled cheese sandwich.

364
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,800
look at that.  Can you
smell that?  Smells good.
Yeah.

365
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,200
baby,
could you get that?

366
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,560
all right.  Hold on a second.
Don't touch the stove.
It's hot.

367
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,480
i got it.

368
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,760
jess ready?
You're drivin' jess?

369
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,200
yep.

370
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,520
no way that cocksucker's
drivin' you.

371
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,880
ho's fine.
Ho's a fucking pimp, okay?

372
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,280
he encourages wendy
to turn tricks,
and she's his fucking wife!

373
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,680
keep it down.
He can hear you.
It's my house!

374
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,080
i'm not gonna keep it down.
He's not fuckin' drivin' you!

375
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,480
listen to me, bobby.

376
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,400
this is my job,
okay?

377
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,760
it puts a roof over me,
my daughter and you,

378
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,160
for as long
as you wanna stay.

379
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,080
i want you to quit.

380
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,440
will you look
at my bills?  I can't.

381
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,760
i'm not gonna put her through
what i went through.
I-i just can't do it.

382
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,160
i'll support you.
With what?

383
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,080
i--  maxie offered
to stake me.

384
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,880
max offers
a lot of things, okay?

385
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,240
i got news for you.
He's not the sweet old guy
you think he is.

386
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,080
don't get
my hopes up, okay?

387
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,920
if i quit, and it doesn't
work out, then what, huh?

388
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,280
i-i can't go
through this again.

389
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,920
this is the last time i speak
to either of you in person...

390
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
about work-related matters.

391
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,680
all our interactions
in the future
will be social.

392
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,520
if you have any questions
that are work-related,

393
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,920
you will direct them
to ruiz.

394
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,800
he has
my complete confidence.

395
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,120
everything you need
or need to know...

396
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,040
is in
those envelopes.

397
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,920
do notopen these envelopes...

398
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,840
until you have
left the office.

399
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,040
i started opening it--
mind if i borrow
a piece of tape?

400
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,880
- that way i'll--
- open the fuckin' thing.

401
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,640
you will each have $1,500,
a numeric pager,

402
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,000
a double-"a" battery
and first-class...

403
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,880
round-trip ticket
to j.F.K.

404
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,800
you will be contacted
on your pager--

405
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,200
so we're going
to new york city?

406
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,000
yes, you're going to new york.

407
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,320
you will be contacted
on your pager--

408
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,760
max, one more thing.

409
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,040
who am i dropping this
off to?  Who gets
their hands on this?

410
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,920
that's your per diem.

411
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,320
yeah,
that's my per diem.

412
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,720
who do i give it to?
Who do i drop it off to?

413
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,600
it's yours.
You keep it.
This is mine to have?

414
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,000
yes.  Yes.
For spending money?

415
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,360
and you got
1,500 too?
Uh-huh.

416
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,280
you will be
contacted...

417
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,680
on your pager
as to where you go.

418
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,480
you have each been given
an extra battery.

419
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,280
so there should be
absolutely no excuse...

420
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,200
when you get
a page...

421
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,120
that you will
answer it immediately.

422
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,040
yes.
Yes, sir.

423
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,920
you will not carry
any other pagers with you.

424
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,240
you will not,
for that matter,
carry anything...

425
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,600
other than what
i have just given you.

426
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,000
- keys?
- what?

427
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,360
what about my house keys?
That way i can get back in.

428
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,720
i could leave 'em with you.
Whatever you wanna do.
You're callin' the shots.

429
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,600
you can carry your keys.

430
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,520
you will not mention
my name...

431
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,360
or imply that you
are in my employ.

432
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,240
you will not
speak to anyone
when you are working.

433
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,080
when you are not working,
you are considered
to be on call...

434
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,960
and available
24 hours a day.

435
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,840
that means that you
do not get drunk...

436
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,720
or do anything
that will prevent you...

437
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,600
from operating
in a professional manner.

438
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,000
there is a number
in your pager's memory.

439
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,360
it is a car service.

440
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,720
if they call you up and they
ask you the account,

441
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,600
you say "cardiff giant".

442
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,480
they will come
and they will
pick you up...

443
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,840
and take you
wherever you
want to go.

444
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,160
that means that
there is no destination
that you cannot reach...

445
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,560
within 15 minutes.

446
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,920
fifteen minutes.
Is there a pattern
forming here?

447
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,280
absolutely.
Yeah.
What is it?

448
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,680
- you want us to be
wherever you want--
- let him tell me.

449
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,520
don't worry about it.
I got it.

450
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,920
tell me.  What is it?

451
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,800
i don't understand why
you're picking on me, max.

452
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,120
because you lost
my fuckin'
carpet-cleaning van,

453
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
and i don't like you,
you cocksucker!

454
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,600
i parked the van and
left it for five minutes,
you want us to be...

455
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,960
wherever you want us to be
a.S.A.P.
I locked it,
put the club on it--

456
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,360
yes.  Good-bye.

457
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,240
what am i dropping off
on the trip?

458
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,120
what's the--
what are we--
good-bye!

459
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,720
here we are.

460
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,600
3d and g.
3d and g.

461
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,840
i think you got it wrong, bob.
That's mine.  I'm in 3d.

462
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,760
you're right here, 3g.
They're both aisles.
What's the--

463
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,120
i was assigned that seat.
I like to follow the rules.
Okay.

464
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,840
you're in 3g,
and i'm in 3d.
All right.  Okay.

465
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,680
oh, man.  See,
when you're in with maxie,
he takes care of your shit.

466
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,040
do you know what i mean?
Stretch it out, keep it nice.
I'll tell you what else.

467
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,920
beats the hell out of
cleaning carpets.
You got that right.

468
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,320
comfortable, comfortable,
comfortable.
I wonder what the movie is.

469
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,720
i'll ask the lady
what the movie is.
Don't bug her.

470
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,640
they like to help.
That's what they're here for.

471
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,560
you'll get used to it.
Don't carry guilt with it.

472
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,960
champagne or orange juice?
Oh, perfect.

473
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,840
what a wonderful kickoff
to the trip.  Cheers.
Okay.

474
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,200
thank you very much.
Uh, ooh.  Okay.

475
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,080
my button down here.

476
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,960
i love
this shit, my man.

477
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,360
this is the kind of thing
i'm talking about.
You with me?

478
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,280
give me it.
Right here.
Yes?

479
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,200
yeah, i was
just wondering...
Excuse me.
Sorry.

480
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,080
what the movie was tonight.
It's in your copy
ofambassador.

481
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,000
i believe it's
mickey blue eyes.

482
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,880
ugh.
I can bring you
a list of videos.

483
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,760
i just want to offer the other
passengers a drink first.
That's great.

484
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,120
what's the overhead
on something like that?

485
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,040
what's the action
that's gonna come my way?

486
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,440
what's the action that's
gonna come your way?
Yeah.

487
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,800
what's it gonna cost me
for the videos?
Oh, no.

488
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,720
you're up front.
Everything's free up here.

489
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,080
oh!  Wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful.
See that shit?

490
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,000
oh, wait a minute.
That--  see, now--

491
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,360
they set you up.

492
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,720
they drop this on you.
I bet there's a hidden tax.

493
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,640
excuse me, sweetie.
Yes.
Excuse me.

494
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,520
where the drinks
are concerned,
is that a hidden tax?

495
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,360
does that fall under
the complimentary service, or is
that something you pay for?

496
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,280
no, no.  They're complimentary.
Would you care for another one?

497
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,680
they're complimentary.
You bet your ass i would.
Yes.

498
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,080
thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

499
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,000
okay.
Thank you.

500
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,880
can i get a cutty
on the rocks too?
Is that complimentary?

501
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,280
yes, yes.
Cheers, man.
You hear that shit?

502
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,200
everything up here
is free.
Okay.

503
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,120
you can drink as much
as you want up front,

504
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,040
have a nice fling,
we get our videos going.

505
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,840
if we didn't have to be on call,
we could drink as much as we
want, but we really shouldn't.

506
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,760
oh, yeah, because they're
probably gonna page us...

507
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,160
and ask us to whack out
the pilot up front.

508
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,560
unless we have
something to do
in the next five hours,

509
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,920
we could sit here,
have drinks, relax like
gentlemen and enjoy ourselves...

510
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,840
and actually have fun
with the trip,
true.

511
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,200
versus complaining about the
trip and every time i sit down,
it's your seat, my seat.

512
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,120
as long as we don't
show up hammered--

513
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,000
as long as we don't talk
to someone like a schoolteacher,
we have fun.

514
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,360
we have to represent max.
That's all we have to do.
I'm representing fucking max.

515
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,280
could you stop
with the--

516
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,120
yes.  Excuse me.
Excuse me.

517
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,520
i want to know
where you're located.
Where's your home?

518
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,440
i operate
out of chicago--
i'm ricky slade.

519
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,360
it's a pleasure
to meet you.

520
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,760
this is my friend here.
This is robert ricigliano.

521
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,680
and what
was your name?
Teri.

522
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,520
it turns out
we're gonna be spending
the night in new york.

523
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,360
it worked out well for all
of us.  I want you to take it
back to the business class.

524
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,760
round up
a couple honeys.

525
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,600
at our hotel room, we're gonna
have kind of a pool party,
california gangster style.

526
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,520
you know, kick-ass
pool party thing?

527
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,880
listen, asshole.  I don't care
if you're the sultan of brunei.

528
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,800
no man talks to me
like that.

529
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,720
now, you can either
learn some manners,

530
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,120
or i can make a formal complaint
to the airport authorities...

531
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,480
and we can sort this out
while you're waiting standby
for the next flight to kennedy.

532
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,400
okay.  Yeah.

533
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,760
what does that mean,
"we can sort it out? "

534
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,120
does she have to do that
so they don't know
she's into my shit?

535
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,000
let's sort it out now.

536
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,240
shit!  I got
no new pages.

537
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,640
i don't even know where
we're supposed to go.

538
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,560
maybe we should
just call a cab.

539
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,960
oh, wait.
There's our guy.

540
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,360
look.  The sign.
Cardiff giant.

541
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,240

that's us.  Bobby.
Hi.  I'm jimmy.

542

548
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,800

551
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,400

i'm talking about, bobby.

552
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,760
first class, you know what
i mean?  You gotta get used
to it.  You deserve it.

553
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,160
you're looking good.

554
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,520
hey, lady, you missed out.
I'm staying at the soho grand
this trip.

555
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,400
i'd give you a ride,
but i gotta stretch my shit out.

556
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,800
i'm a tall drink of water.
I don't wanna wrinkle anything.

557
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,320
looks good.  Okay,
so whenever i want to--

558
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,640
uh, yeah, well, uh,
grab one of those cards
over there by the phone.

559
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,040
right over there?
Yeah.
These, by the thing?

560
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,440
call my number.
It's my cell.
Okay.

561
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,360
you want one here?
Get a card.

562
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,200
perfect, my man.

563
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,520
so, jimbo, you're pretty much
like my boy for this thing,
like my own private guy?

564
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,840
well, i handle most of, uh,
cardiff giant's accounts.
Yeah.  Okay.

565
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,720
do you
know my pager number?
I don't know.  What is it?

566
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,560
i don't know.
I thought maybe
you'd know what it is.

567
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,440
you got any idea
what kind of job
i'm throwin' down this time?

568
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,800
the job?

569
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,680
all i know is, uh,
that i'm taking you
to the soho grand.

570
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,600
where is that?
It's in soho.

571
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,200
the area is called soho...

572
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,120
because it's located
just directly south of houston.

573
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,040
therefore it's soho.

574
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,400
yeah.
There's a spa downstairs.
You gentlemen work out?

575
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,800
let's see the digs here.
Is that all right?

576
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,720
oh, max.
Lookin' good, huh?

577
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,600
there's an excellent cafe
called caviar,
and it's downstairs.

578
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,440
it's great for people-watching,
and willem dafoe comes there
sometimes and--

579
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,840
where are you
gentlemen from?

580
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,240
we're from out of town.
Here's the key
to the minibar.

581
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,160
oh, great.
Is that for this here?

582
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,080
room and tax
have been picked up
by cardiff giant,

583
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,000
sure has.
Plus 150 in incidentals.

584
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,400
i'm sorry.  An incidental.
I'm not following exactly.

585
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:45,200
oh, that's, uh, phone,
room service, minibar.
Any additional expense.

586
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,600
thanks a lot.
Take care.
Show him his room.

587
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,480
oh, mr. Slade,
you're in room 808.

588
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,360
give me the key.
I'm gonna hang here
a bit.  Thanks.

589
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,760
oh, is it good?
Uh, what's that?

590
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,080
right.  Okay.
Let's see here.
The room.
I can take you there.

591
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,960
that's all right.
Let's see here.  Uh--

592
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,880
that's all i got.
You got change
for a hundred?

593
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,760
i don't.
Not on me, sir.
Okay, bring me back 80.

594
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,680
are you sure?
Go on.  You know
what we're doing.

595
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,040
thank you very much, sir.
I'm sorry.
How is it?
So i know.

596
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,920
what kind of room
are we looking at
now that this happened?

597
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,280
- all the suites
are about the same, sir.
-yeah.  Okay.  Look it.

598
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,640
i don't have time to negotiate.
I know you got fish
to drop off, probably.

599
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
what are we
looking at?
Honestly,

600
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,960
the suites
are about the same.
If you bring me back 60,

601
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,880
does one suite look better
than the other suites?
Hi, girls.

602
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,800
uncle bobby here.

603
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,680
...As good a suite as
we have, unless you want
two bedrooms.

604
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,600
would you like
two bedrooms?
No, that's cool.

605
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,000
just make sure i get back
the original 80, then.

606
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,400
i want back the 80.
But the 20's for you,
captain.

607
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,320
thanks for
showing us up.
Thank you very much.

608
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,720
thanks a lot, man.
Hey, uh, one last thing.

609
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,600

Tonight's a good--
as far as?

610
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,440
you know, nightlife.
The hot ass and that?
Oh, uh, women?

611
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,800
yeah, women.  If i was a fag,
i could get laid on the subway.

612
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,200
stay with me here.
Just stay with me.
Go quickly.

613
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,080
i-i-i don't know.
Oh, the forum's
pretty hot tonight.

614
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,000
forum's hot?
Might be hard
to get in.

615
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
you let me worry about that.
Look at me.  Okay?

616
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,840

Throw it to me.

617
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,720

Need me to write it down?
Perfect.

618
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,120

with the 80.
I'll bring up your change.

619
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,040
i'll put this in your room.
Don't spill that.
I like the fish.

620
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,440
come on!
Who you callin' now?

621
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,360
don't worry about it.

622
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,160
hello, room service?
Can i get a couple cheeseburgers
and two heinekens, please?

623
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,520
no, i'm ricky slade,
but i'm actually staying--
how did you know that?

624
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,360
that's cool.
They got computers so you don't
have to say what room you're in.

625
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,720
- find out how much it is.
-just so you know,
they know where you're at.

626
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,640
how much is it?  Perfect.

627
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
if it's up in the next
15 minutes, i'm gonna
tell you how i do right now.

628
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,880
ten-dollar tip.
I'm settin' the precedent now.

629
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,800
how much is it?
In the future
when i call,

630
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
and i say that
to you, okay?

631
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,600
how much was it?
It's 46.
That's all.

632
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,960
forty-six plus ten.
Yeah, but you
have to tip people.

633
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,880
it's my fuckin' room.
You don't give a shit.

634
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,680
bob, you heard the captain.
You have $150 in incidentals.

635
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,600
that falls under
the incidental, but you
didn't wanna listen.

636
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,480
- ricky, how long
are we gonna be here?
- i have no idea.

637
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,360
we don't know.  That's my point.
We might have to make it last.

638
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,240
do you want 'em
to put it on mine?
I want this to stop.

639
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,560
- it's on me, okay?
- i've looked forward to
this trip for a long time.

640
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,480
could we just be
smart about this?
I'll be smart.

641
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,880
fine, but i'm gonna
tell you something.

642
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,720
- i don't like your attitude.
- you don't likemyattitude?
What's wrong with it?

643
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,600
look around.
We're moving up in the world.
We should be enjoying ourselves.

644
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,960
i know you had a blue-collar
mentality pounded into your head
your whole life.  I have too.

645
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,360
but if you act like an asshole,
and you don't own your shit,

646
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,720
they're gonna smell you
coming away like a cheap suit.

647
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,120
- who's gonna smell me?
- i swear to god.

648
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,000
i'm trying to save you
when we have to meet
the real people...

649
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,360
that you don't
come off like, you know--
i don't wanna say it.

650
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,280
i don't want to get
into name-calling.

651
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,200
okay.  Can we
make this work, please?

652
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,080
i'm trying
to make it work.
Let's settle down.

653
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,960
you know what i'm talkin' about.
Don't play dumb with me.

654
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,360
- what are you doing?
- what the fuck are you doing?

655
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,280
i know you're not
calling jimmy.

656
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,200
i am.  You got a problem
with that too?

657
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,560
hang up the phone.
I'll talk to you.
Just hang up the phone.

658
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
look, we're here
representing max,

659
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,360
and you're running around
like a puerto rican
on the 15th of the month.

660
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,720
you don't think maxie wants us
to roll hard, why give us all
the bread or the pager?

661
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,120
you represent max well
by showing some fucking class.

662
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,520
the man has got an operation
in new york, bobby.

663
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,400
please, hang up
the phone.
I am not
nickel-and-diming my way to--

664
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,280
the bar's across the street.
We can walk there.
I don't wanna fuckin' walk!

665
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,680
give me
the fucking phone!
I don't fuckin' wanna walk!

666
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,040

shithead!

668
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,560
how 'bout jimmy?
You know jimmy, the driver?

669
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,480
or cardiff giant?
Maybe you should check that.

670
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,880
cardiff giant.
You ever deal with them before?

671
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
have you ever dealt
with my people before?

672
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,720
jimmy, the driver?
Are you familiar with him?

673
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,640
we're with
the cardiff giant account.

674
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,960
fuckin' horseshit.
"maybe you should try
the china club".

675
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
fuck you,
asshole.

676
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,760
place looked like
a fuckin' fag bar anyway,
don't you think?

677
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,680
probably
a fuckin' fag bar.

678
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,080
that's it.
That's it.

679
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,480
that's us.
Let's go.
Move your shit.

680
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,920

681
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200

You gotta call him!
It's out of order!

682
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,080
asshole!

683
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,440

687
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,000

i have to make.

688
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,400

a second, all right?
Okay.  A minute.

689
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,800

I have to use the phone.
I'll pay for the call.

693
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,320

There's a million fuckin' phones
in this city.

694
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,200
you're fuckin' with my phone.
You're gonna have to wait
a fuckin' minute.

695
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,080
this is bullshit.
It's bullshit.
I just wanna--

696
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,880
he'll call you back.

697
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,640
so, jimmy, you know
where this address is?

698
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,040
yeah, i'll find it.
I know harlem.

699
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,440
harlem?

700
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,360
is that wher--
we're going to harlem?

701
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,280
you don't know
where you're goin? '

702
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,680
i know the cross streets.

703
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,560
well, this is
the corner.

704
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,920
i could wait around
if you want.

705
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,840
no, that's cool, man.

706
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,160
what exactly did
they say to you?

707
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,520
they said meet 'em
on the corner of 135th street
and 12th avenue.

708
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,440
did they tell you
what kind of address?

709
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,800
i told you what they said.
They said meet 'em here.
They didn't say anything else?

710
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,720
i told you what
they said.  No.

711
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,600
how the fuck did
they know who you were?
They asked me.

712
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,520
then they
said more--
they didn't say shit.

713
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,920
they fuckin' said--
they asked me who i was.

714
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,800
then they said to meet 'em
on this corner.
That's my point.

715
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,720
they said more than
what the fuck
the thing was.

716
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,640
they did say more
than you said
that they said.

717
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,520
be honest.
They said more than
you said what they said.

718
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,440
they said fucking
meet here, okay?

719
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,200
oh, fuck.  This is such
fuckin' bullshit, man.
I don't know where i am.

720
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,560
what the fuck do you
have to complain about?
Don't fuckin' start with me.

721
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,960
you should get
fuckin' information
when you're on the phone.

722
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,840
i don't understand
what you got to fuckin'
complain about, man.

723
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,760
why is this gig
so fuckin' horrible to you?

724
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,640
you've been on my ass
to get on maxie's list.
Here we are.

725
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,040
because i never fuckin' met
this fuckin' ruiz guy.

726
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,400
i got no idea what the fuck
i'm dropping off,
who i'm fuckin' pickin' up,

727
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,320
or what the fuck
i'm supposed to meet.

728
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,120
and fuckin' maxie's
still pissed at me because
i sold his carpet-cleaning van.

729
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,000
sold?
I thought you said
theystoleit.

730
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,400
i sold it.
What the fuck difference
does the fuckin' thing make?

731
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,760
oh, motherfucker!
Don't make it like you
feel bad for that fuckin' guy.

732
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,640
give me a fuckin--'
i vouched for you!

733
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,560
look, relax, okay.
Relax.

734
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,960
you don't get it.
That's what fuckin'
bothers me.

735
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,360
you fuckin' have the wrong idea
to feel bad for that guy,

736
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,720
because you know that max
fucks all the girls that work
for him as strippers.

737
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,120
if there's one guy
not to feel bad for,
it's him.

738
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,000
what does that mean?
Listen to me
before you do anything.

739
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,360
i'm just saying
that i fuckin' heard
that he fucks girls.

740
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,280
that he fucks his--

741
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,200
i heard he fucked them.
I'll protect myself.

742
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,600
come on.
Come on.
Fuck you, motherfuck--

743
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,400
get the fuck off me!

744
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,680
yo, bobby!

745
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,440
you know this guy here?
Yeah, his name's horrace.

746
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,800

747
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,640
ready to meet ruiz?

748
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,000
fuckin' embarrassing.
I gotta ride down the street.

749
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,400
the whole neighborhood.
The guy doesn't have
a fuckin' shirt on.

750
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,800

Suck it up.  Come on.

751
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,120

It's too risky.
I want out.

752
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,320
listen, man.  We made
a lot of money on this one
together, but it's over.

753
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,720
shit's goin' down.
I'm sellin' my end.

754
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,600
this internet shit
is entirely too volatile.

755
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,440
i'm gonna take my block
of microsoft--  yeah.

756
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,760

759
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,960
all right, then.
Peace.

760
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,280

This is maxie's cavalry?

00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,600

762
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,000

763
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,400

He asked me a question.

00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,240

00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,600

we rode the sleds.

787
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,880
y'all gonna meet us at spa,
in the v.I.P. Room.

788
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,280
- don't get lost.
- i don't know
where the spa is.

789
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,120
13th street, man.
Jimmy knows.
Just be cool, man.

790
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,360
who the fuck is he
to call me a guinea?

791
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,280
what do you care
what he calls you?
A guinea!

792
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,600
is he your friend?  Let's get
this shit done with and go home.
He's not my friend.

793
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,440
do you think this isn't
the drop happening now?

794
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,360
i don't know.
I don't know anything.

795
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,240
you'd think
if it was happening now,
they'd tell us that.

796
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,120
yeah, one would think.
So i'm under the impression
that it's not the drop.

797
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,520
probably not.  I don't know.
- i don't know either.

798
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,360
taking a time-out
from you, jimbo.

799
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,760
that's not cool.
I don't want him
looking at me.

800
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,640
i don't want him to think
you're blowin' me.
You're so fuckin' weird.

855
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,480
nah, he's making contact.
That's the welshman.

856
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,400
what's his name?

857
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,320
ruiz don't like to use names
on cell phones,

858
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,160
so he calls him
the "red dragon," but that's
just between us, on a low.

859
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,840
- when is the drop?
- to be honest with you,
i don't know shit either.

860
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,240
all i know is
it ain't drugs
and it ain't now.

861
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,160
how do you know
it's not drugs?

862
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,560
because maxie know
i ain't doin'
no more cocaine time.

863
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,920
it ain't now because ruiz
didn't tell me it was now.
Now shut the fuck up.

864
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,320
all right,
all right, man.

865
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,160

strapped?
What, motherfucker?

866
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,040
it means are you
carrying a gun?
I know what
the fuck "strapped" means?

867
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,920
what's up with this
21 jump streetshit, man?

868
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,800

872
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,320
uh, the name's tom.
Yeah.

873
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,720
so where's
the red dragon's lair?

874
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,640
uh--
where do you
call home?

875
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,040
where do you lay
your head down?
Home?  Home?  Glasgow.

876
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,440
yeah, and where
exactly might that be?

877
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,280
uh, that's, uh, scotland.
Scotland?

878
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,160
how come the word
on the street is that
you're welsh, my man?

879
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,560
there's a buzz goin' around
about you bein' welsh.

880
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,440
enough of the introductions.
I want you to meet somebody.

881
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,280
you like
big titties, right?
Yeah!  Love big titties.  Yeah.

882
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,440
what the fuck was you told?
Don't talk, right?

883
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,840
unless spoken to, ruiz.
Isn't that right, horrace?

884
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,680
you know that
to be true as well.
Don't bring me into this shit.

885
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,600
look, he spoke to me.

886
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,000
what do you expect me
to do in a situation
like that?  Dis him?

887
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,880
"dis"?  "dis?"

888
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,800
let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

889
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,640
you're in no position
to "dis" or "give props..."

890
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,960
or whatever your mtv
real world sense of fuckin'
decorum tells you to do!

891
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,840
you're nothing!
You're a fuckin' amateur!

892
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,200

to make fuckin' friends!

893
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,120

to handle people.

907
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,520
i'm not sayin' shit
to neither one of you.
W-what--

908
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,920
shut the fuck--
what the fuck did i say
that was so fuckin' bad?

909
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,320
the red fuckin' dragon?
Why is that bad?

910
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,640
what did i say
that was so fucking--
the red dragon!

911
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,560
how bad is the situation?

912
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,480
how bad
is the situation?
It's bad, man!

913
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,320
ruiz already said you were
fuckin' max's token goons
and not to be trusted.

914
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,680
he wanted to do
this shit himself!
I was gonna ride shotgun,

915
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,600
keep the fuckin' english dude
above board.

916
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,480
now this fuckin' bull?
Oh, my--

917
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,360
when's the drop
going down?

918
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,240
it was supposed to be tomorrow,
but who the fuck knows now!

919
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,640
ask the red dragon
when the drop is!

920
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,560
if it's gonna
make everyone happier,

921
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,360
i'll tell him
i heard the red dragon thing
from somebody else, okay?

922
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,760
i'll tell him
i heard the red dragon
from someone else!

923
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,120
all right.
You know what?  I--

924
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,480
we don't wanna talk.
We wanna scream at people.

925
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,880
but we don't wanna
listen or problem-solve.

926
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,240
that's what's frustrating
about the fuckin' dynamic
of the group.

927
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,640
are you happy?

928
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,040
am i fucking happy
about what?

929
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,920
why do you have to
make everything
so fuckin' difficult?

930
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,320
don't come at me too.
I'm gonna come at you.

931
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,200
you're like a fucking bull
in a china shop, man.

932
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,560

I don't need this shit.
Where you going?

933
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,920

go in, have a good time,
have drink.

934
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,320
i'm not gonna sit here
and be negative.

935
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,720
not in there.
They know you're with ruiz.

936
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,640
damn straight.
That's why
i'm going back in.

937
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,000
fuck you.  Go.
I'm taking the car, though.
Fuck you.  Fine.

938
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,880

939
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,600

940
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,760
- wait here.

941
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,120
seriously.
I'm having a lot of fun.
Are you having a good time?

942
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,480
you were really dancing.
That was some great stuff.
Hey.

943
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,880
hey!  Look who's back.
Grab a bottle, will you?

944
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,240

I don't want this
on ruiz's tab.

945
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,120
close ruiz's tab.
You're damn right.
Close the tab.

946
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,040
but two more bottles
of dom champ, okay?

947
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,840
here's 50 bucks.
Take this in case i get drunk
and i call you a bitch later.

948
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,240
i'm only kidding,
but take it anyway.

949
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,640
i'm gonna do it all night long,

950
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,480
no, you don't know him.
I don't know him.
Loud on the phone.

951
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,400

952
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,240

getting real comfortable
in their kimono.

970
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,480
- very comfortable.  Yes.
- that's right.

971
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,880
do you like surprises?

972
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,240

974
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,040
oh.
Let's check it out.

975
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,440

This is a surprise
built for one, though.

976
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,800
i'm sorry.
That's all right, honey,

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,280

but i work out.

979
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,680
yeah.  I hear you.
I don't wanna
work out all the time.

980
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,040
i don't wanna
talk about him.
That's what i'm trying to do.

981
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,440
let's not argue,
because we're having
such a nice time.
We're not.

988
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,680
what the fuck happened?
What did he do?

989
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,080
what did he do?
We used to
take baths together.

990
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,480
oh, the bath.  Honey.

991

She was jonesing for me.
Next thing, she freaks out.

996
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,240
is everything okay?
I heard a noise.
Is everything all right?

997
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,640
i heard a commotion.
Is everything okay?
Everything's fine.

998
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,480
they're complaining
downstairs.
It was just
a little weird.

999
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,360
this is a mess.
They're complaining
downstairs about you.

1000
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,760
i'm sorry.
Everything's taken care of.
Our last guest is leaving.

1001
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,640
i'm fine.
I've had a rough night.
You okay?

1002
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,040
i just want to be alone.
I'm fine.  Thanks.

1003
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,400
i'd give you some money.
I don't have it.
Want us to bring some--

1004
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,320
i just want you
to leave, please.

1005
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,160
get the fuck out.  I'm sorry.
Just get the fuck out.
Can you get out of the room?

1006
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,560
get the fuck
out of the room.

1007
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,840
hi.  It's bobby.

1008
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,200
okay.

1009
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,600
yeah.
We're at the hotel now.

1010
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,960
okay.  Five minutes.
We'll be downstairs.
Where we--

1011
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,880
okay.  So the driver
knows where to go?

1012
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,720
okay.
We'll see you in five.

1013
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,120
what's up, man?
Ruiz wants to
meet with us right now.

1014
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,480
where does he want to meet us?
He didn't say.  He said
jimmy knows where to go.

1015
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,320
that means that we're
fucking getting whacked--
we're not getting whacked!

1016
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,200
then why the fuck
wouldn't he tell you
where the sit-down is?

1017
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,120
who says it's a sit-down?
Shit's fuckin'
all going crazy!

1018
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,480
he says we're gonna
go over the plan.
Yeah.

1019
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,360
- yeah.  Okay.
We're gonna go over the plan.
-what are you doing?

1020
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,160
i got a bad feeling.
What are you gonna do,
shank him in the shower?

1021
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,520
is it so unrealistic
to believe that ruiz,
who doesn't want us here,

1022
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,920
is gonna throw us
to the fuckin' wolves
as an apology?

1023
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,320
i don't know
what i'm dropping off!
You don't know what!

1024
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,160
i don't know
where the drop is!
We haven't had any sleep.

1025
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,560
let's keep our mouths closed
and not make any mistakes.

1026
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,960
i'm gonna go upstairs.
Throw on some clothes,
all right?

1027
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,800
let's get downstairs
in five minutes so we're not
late and make things worse.

1028
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,400
would you put
that thing out,
please?

1029
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,320
come on.
I swear i'll puke.
Put it out.

1030
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,200
jimmy,
where they taking us?
Where they gonna whack us?

1031
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,080
if they're whacking you,
they're doing it in style.

1032
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,040
jesus christ.
Where y'all been all night?
You look like shit.

1033
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,960
good morning.

1034
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,360
good morning.  Shit.

1035
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,680
you think this shit
is funny, horrace?

1036
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,080
nah, just saying that--
you think this is funny,
motherfucker?

1037
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,000
all i said--
all right.
Easy, ruiz.

1038
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,840
don't "easy ruiz" me.
You turned an easter egg hunt
into a butt-fuck-a-thon.

1039
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,200
gimme four eggs benedict
and a mimosa.

1040
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,560
y'all want mimosas?
No, thank you, man.  I don't
think i could eat anything.

1041
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,480
four mimosas.
You'll love 'em.

1042
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,800
all right, tom, the welsh dude,
he don't but dabble a little.
He's small-time.

1043
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,160
maxie had me
hook up this loan through
an austrian passbook account.

1044
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,480
- money laundering.
- would you tell peter jennings
to shut up and listen?

1045
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,320
so what do you want from us?
What do you need us to do?

1046
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,640
come here.
Now, here's the plan.
Yeah.

1047
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,520
take the money
to the welshman.
He's gonna check it.

1048
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,880
he's gonna hand you his marker,
and you're done.  That's it.

1049
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,720
as long as you
hand off the bag,
you're tight.

1050
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,120
all right.
When is the drop?
Now, you three,

1051
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,040
y'all gonna set up
dinner with him?

1052
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,440
there you gonna find out
if and where.

1053
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,240
- anything else?
- so who's gonna outfit us
for this thing?

1054
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,640
outfit?  What the fuck
is he talking about?

1055
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,000
i realize you're gonna want
to have me strapped in case
there's a situation.

1056
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,400
strapped?  The last person
i want with a gun is you.

1057
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,280
please don't give this
motherfucker no gun.

1058
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,200
this is as routine as it gets.

1059
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,560
i could've turned it offshore,
but maxie likes to do it
his way-- safe.

1060
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,920
i could've
dropped the bag myself.
It's only 200 gs.

1061
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,840
but he sent you two.

1062
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,200
so i can either
call maxie and tell him
how you fucked up,

1063
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,120
send your asses home,

1064
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,480
or we can flush it down
the toilet one more time,
see if it goes down.

1065
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,800
look, man,  all we have to do
is meet the welsh guy.

1066
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,200
make him feel comfortable.
Do whatever it takes.

1067
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,520
drink some tea.  Whatever
the fuck they do in scotland
or wherever he's from.

1068
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,880
make him feel comfortable
till he brings up the drop
on his own.

1069
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,680
you make the drop, we're on
a plane back to california,
fuckin' hos off melrose.

1070
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,040
when's
this meeting?

1071
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,400
6:45 at the globe,
park avenue.

1072
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,760
6:45.  6:45.

1073
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,160
6:45, motherfucker.

1074
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,560
we need guns.
I'm telling you.
We don't need guns.

1075
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,480
i'm pretty sure
we need guns.

1076
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,360
they specifically said
we do not need guns.
That's all the more reason...

1077
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,760
why you do need a gun.

1078
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,120
you couldn't even
get a gun.
You wanna bet me?

1079
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,000
you couldn't even
get a hand job from
the bridge-and-tunnel posse.

1080
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,400
that fuckin' girl
had personal issues
with the bathtub.

1081
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,320
now float me 100 bucks.
Why?

1082
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,680
wanna see how fast
i can get a gun?
What happened to your money?

1083
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,560
i have some stuff left.
I got, like, 80 bucks.
How much?

1084
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,960
eighty?
Eighty-five.
I got five in the room.

1085
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,800
- what happened to the 1,500?
- you could've picked up a tab
once in a while.

1086
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,200
- i picked up half the fuckin--

1087
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,440
shut the fuck up!
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Don't do it to me!

1088
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,840
watch it, boys.
Watch it.  Let's go.

1089
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,240
sorry, ma'am.
Yes.  Okay.  Be careful.

1090
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,600
now, look at that.
They're all standing up for us.

1091
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,960
okay.  Look,
can we calm down, please,

1092
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,360
and try to
talk about it civilized
and have a discussion?

1093
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,720
all i'm saying
is i vouched for you,
ricky, and you fucked me.

1094
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,120
this is peanuts compared
to what we're gonna make
down the road.

1095
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,000
i don't wanna
make money down the road.
This is it for me.

1096
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,400
i wanna take this money
so jess doesn't have to
grind her ass...

1097
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,280
into men's erections
to put her kid
through private school.

1098
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,640
you're my friend.
You stuck up for me
to be on this trip.

1099
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,520
i respect that.  I'm sorry
if i've caused you problems.

1100
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,440
i see things
i don't think you're seeing.

1101
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,360
i'm not mad at you,
okay?
Okay.

1102
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,240
it just could've been easy
if we handled it differently.

1103
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,160
let's get some sleep.
We're gonna feel better.

1104
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,560
we can't sleep.
We got three hours.

1105
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,960
that's why we should
spend this time getting guns.

1106
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,800
see?  You're crazy.
We don't want a gun.
That's gonna get us killed.

1107
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,640
you knocked the jew's tooth out.
That's gonna cost max
eight grand, maybe more.

1108
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,480
you probably lost him
his whole line of clientele too.
You've fucked up jess's dancing.

1109
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,800
i think he knows
i sold the fuckin' carpet van.
He's been giving me looks.

1110
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,160
he can't kill us in los angeles
'cause there's questions,
right?

1111
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,520
all of a sudden he flies us
to new york city to do a drop.

1112
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,360
we don't know what the drop is,
but if we disappear here,
there's no questions involved.

1113
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,760
there's no questions.
L.A., questions.

1114
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,160
drop out here.
A lot of questions.

1115
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,560
how do you come up
with this shit?
Bob--

1116
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,440
you're fuckin' los--
you got a screw loose.
I'm loose?  I know.

1117
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,280
i'm always loose.
Here's scenario "b" for you.
See how you feel about this one.

1118
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,080
i don't know if you've noticed,
but i think i'm starting to get
under ruiz's skin as well.

1119
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,480
it all started
with the red dragon
or the welsh guy.

1120
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,840
they can play it down,
but you know 200 grand's
a lot of money.

1121
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,680
that's a fucking lot of money,
okay?  Two hundred grand
is definitely a lot of money.

1122
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,560
i got ruiz, along with fuckin'
fruit pie the fuckin' magician,

1123
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,880
tellin' me that i can't
fuckin' call my main man max
who fuckin' sent me?

1124
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,720
what about the welsh guy?
He's fuckin' scared all over.
They disappear and talk.

1125
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,560
you haven't noticed, but when
he's not fuckin' looking at me,
or you're doing whatever,

1126
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,480
i got jimmy in the mirror
with his shit too.

1127
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,880
it's fuckin' comin' at me.
I don't know where it is.

1128
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,760
might be comin' this way,
might be comin' that way,
but the shit's comin,'

1129
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,160

1206
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,600

1213
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,840
leave them on the bar,
finish their drink...

1214
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,720

making a play against

"troughed off" bar, drop off

01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:12,080
if that motherfucker right there
don't take that knife away
from my friend's neck,

1277
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,920
i'll use all six shots
to make sure you're dead.

1278
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,840
now do you
believe it?

1279
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,720
do you fuckin' believe it?

1280
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,840
now i want everyone
to drop their bats
and toys and--

1281
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,720
- it's a starter pistol.
- what?

1282
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,600
his gun is a fuckin'
starter pistol.

1283
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,480
i can see the red plug
in your fuckin' barrel!

1284
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:43,760
listen to me.  I intentionally
make this gun look that way
because i am smart.

1285
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,680
i don't wanna draw--

1286
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,680
that's enough!
That's enough.

1287
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:13,040
come back here, ho.
Get over in the corner,
all you guys.

1288
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:17,840
get over in the corner!
Drop your weapons.

1289
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,240
i said drop
your fuckin' weapons!

1290
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,160
get over in the corner.

1291
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,040
over in the fuckin' corner!

1292
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,880
take out your wallets right now.
Put 'em on the table.

1293
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,720
turn around.

1294
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,640
turn around.

1295
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,040
put your hands
behind your head.

1296
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,840
now get
on your fuckin' knees.
Get on your knees!

1297
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,040
bobby, come here.
Take that.

1298
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,240
nice work, bobby.

1299
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,640
i'll let maxie know
you're good in the pocket.

1300
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,760
go home.

1301
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,800
you know,
you boys did good.

1302
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,640
i never intended to test you
to such an extent,

1303
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,040
but you come through.

1304
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,440
i could've used a call.

1305
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,840
ruiz said not to call.

1306
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,240
i'll take that up with ruiz.

1307
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,600
you got the money,
though?
The money come through.

1308
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,520
i could've used a call.

1309
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,880
as for you, ricky,
your draw,

1310
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,640
that's gonna go
to a new carpet-cleaning van.

1311
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,760
i walked into a room
full of fuckin' westies
for that.

1312
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,160
if they were westies,
you'd be dead.

1313
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,080
that's not the point.
We're square.

1314
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,160
as for you, bobby,

1315
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,560
your days of fighting
for crumbs are over.

1316
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,400
take a week, come back,
we'll talk about
the next thing.

1317
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,040
i don't think there's
gonna be a next thing, max.

1318
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,440
take a few days.

1319
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,760
i don't need a few days.
I'm through, and jess
is through dancing for you.

1320
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,640
yeah, well,
i hate to, uh--

1321
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,000
i hate to break up
your, uh,

1322
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,880
fantasy dream,
or whatever the fuck it is,

1323
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,720
but i've been
paying jessica's rent
for eight months.

1324
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,240
thank you for the opportunity.
We're gonna be leaving now.

1325
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,120
oh, god.

1326
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,040
mmph.

1327
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,920
a lot going on.

1328
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,760
but there always is,
isn't there--
a lot going on?

1329
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,120
mmm.
I gotta tell you,

1330
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,400
i am sure glad that
that fuckin' van
is out of the way.

1331
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,800
it was hanging over my head
for too long.

1332
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,680
bobby can be
a little hasty sometimes.

1333
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,560
you said what to him?
"wait a few days".

1334
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:48,400
smart.  Let's let him
wait a few days.

1335
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:53,200
i'm gonna go ahead
and hold onto this for him.
Keep your hands off the money.

1336
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,600
maybe he'll decide--
okay.  Okay.
Don't touch the money!

1337
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,000
leave the money right there.

1338
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,400
my point being--
get the fuck out.

1339
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,240
understood, but if he changes
his mind, can he come back--
get the fuck out.

1340
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,120
okay.  Okay.

1341
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,520
nice to see you.

1342
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,840
asshole.

1343
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,800
i'll check on the girls.

1344
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,760
i'll be right out.

1345
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,680
chloe?

1346
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:43,440
- where's mommy?

1347
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,960
your--
i just--

1348
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,800
why don't you get your shit?

1349
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,320
i never promised you
anything, okay?

1350
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,720
how could you let her
see you like this?

1351
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,520
bye, bobby.

1352
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,640
- i bought you out with max
in case you wanna leave.
- i don't wanna leave.

1353
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,560
you do
what you gotta do,

1354
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,880
but that little girl out there
is such a special person--

1355
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,240
- take her.
- what?

1356
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,440
take her.

1357
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,520
hey, chloe.

1358
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:26,160
i just talked to your mom,
and she thought that, um,

1359
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,040
it might be a good idea
if for a little while...

1360
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,440
maybe you and me
went on a trip someplace.

1361
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,000
okay?
Is that okay?

1362
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,360
yeah.
We're gonna go now.

1363
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,760
all right?
Okay.

1364
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,640
- there's ricky.
- hey, baby.  How are you?

1365
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,520
good.
Yeah?  You feel good?

1366
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,400
yeah.
I don't think
they were expecting me.

1367
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,760
i'm sorry, man.
Is she okay?

1368
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,120
yeah.  I think
she's hungry.

1369
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,000
wanna get something to eat?
Get the seat belt on.

1370
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,880
you wanna go color
some things?  Frogs?

1371
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,280
uh-uh.
Leopards?

1372
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:25,520
- are you all right, man?
- me?  Oh, yeah.
I'm all right.

1373
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,920
you okay?
You should be okay.
I'm okay.

1374
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,280
i'm okay.  I'm okay.
You should be.
Good.

1375
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,680
- don't ask me
if i'm okay again.
- i'm not asking you.

1376
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,080
let's just
get some food.
Let's get some food.

1377
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,440
- i'm not okay.

1378
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,480
here we go.

1379
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:00,440
did everyone get cake?

1380
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,360
yes!

1381
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,240
let's say happy birthday
to chloe.  Get your toys
and do your things,

1382
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,160
'cause the big people
gotta talk now.

1383
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,520
everyone's reading
the same stuff, but 6-7,
it's different reading material.

1384
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,400
that's an age
we wanna get her going.
I listened to the counselor.

1385
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,320
she said she tested
exceptional.
Yes.

1386
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:19,160
she said the public schools,
with the magnet schools,
will take care of everything.

1387
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,080
i understand what a magnet does.

1388
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,000
i don't mean
to condescend.
But you do in a way.

1389
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,400
worse comes to worst,
we send her to private school.

1390
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,800
don't spend $10,000
for her to learn to color.

1391
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,680
if you're on this side
of the hill, she can
go to regular school.

1392
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,560
it's easy
when you're at work all day
to say she shouldn't watch mtv,

1393
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:36,440
but you deal with it
for eight hours.

1394
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,280
oh, there you are.
Where were you five minutes ago
when the kids were going crazy?

1395
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:44,600
now you show up.  Okay.
Mousy, i'm trying to do
a little business here.

1396
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,480
here.  Go run
around the parking lot
or something, will ya?

1397
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,560
yeah!

1398
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,800
look out.

1399
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,720
yeah!

1400
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,960
look out.

1401
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,840
take it away, munch.

1402
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,920
ah-ha!

1403
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,280
now we can sing the love
song that i wanted to--

1404
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,640
oh, well, look at that.
We're all out of time.

1405
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,560
kids, we're gonna
take a short break.

1406
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:06,360
we'll be back in a few minutes
with more songs and fun,
so, uh, stay tuned.

1407
