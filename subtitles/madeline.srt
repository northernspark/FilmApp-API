00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,641
Madeline!

3
00:01:18,686 --> 00:01:20,620
Got ya.

4
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:44,278
In an old house in Paris
that was covered in vines...

5
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:46,375
lived 12 little girls...

6
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:49,242
in two straight lines.

7
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:52,950
In two straight lines
they broke their bread...

8
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:56,089
and brushed their teeth...

9
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:58,816
and went to bed.

10
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,151
They smiled at the good...

11
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,093
and frowned at the bad.

12
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:16,367
And sometimes they were very sad.

13
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:23,743
They left the house at half past nine...

14
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:26,878
in two straight lines...

15
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:28,285
in rain...

16
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,290
or shine.

17
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:36,560
The smallest one was Madeline.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,934
What do you think?

19
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,232
It's great.
You've really captured it.

20
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:47,297
- Madeline!
- Au revoir.

21
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:52,974
The circus is coming!

22
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,480
Come! Come!

23
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,017
Come one, come all!

24
00:02:57,085 --> 00:03:00,020
See the Idiots Popopov!

25
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:02,579
Experience the depths of terror...

26
00:03:02,657 --> 00:03:07,287
at the sight of the man-eating tiger!

27
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,224
To the tiger in the zoo,
Madeline just said...

28
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:11,731
Pooh-pooh!

29
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:19,664
And nobody knew so well
how to frighten Miss Clavel.

30
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,343
Get down!

31
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,073
Take that!

32
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
Bless Lady Covington...

33
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:38,291
and protect her
that she may recover quickly...

34
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:47,193
And bless this food
we are about to receive to our use...

35
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,464
and us to Thy service.

36
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,800
Amen.

37
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:01,879
Chicken Helene.

38
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,180
Good night, little girls.

39
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,741
Thank the Lord you are well.

40
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,549
And now go to sleep.

41
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,215
Good night, good night, Miss Clavel.

42
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:51,429
Elizabeth, Veronica, Sylvette...

43
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,627
Marie-Odile, Serena, Beatrice...

44
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:57,535
Lucinda, Chantal, Lolo...

45
00:04:57,605 --> 00:05:01,041
Victoria, Aggie and Madeline.

46
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,445
Especially Madeline.

47
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,049
Amen.

48
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:37,567
Something is not right.

49
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:45,247
Madeline's burning up!

50
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:48,087
Should we call the fire department?

51
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:50,248
No, Chantal.
"Burning up" is a metaphor.

52
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,884
Like " Chantal is thick
as a plank."

53
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,791
- Victoria.
- That's a simile.

54
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:58,127
- Go get Helene. Now.
- Ooh, my tummy!

55
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,133
She must've eaten something
super horrid!

56
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,828
We all ate the same thing!

57
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,770
- That means we're all gonna die!
- Girls, that's enough.

58
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,564
My hat! Where's my hat?

59
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,361
Girls, find Madeline's hat!

60
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,368
I'll check.

61
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:44,675
Where is it?
Think like a hat.

62
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,679
I'm a hat.

63
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,452
- Hurry up!
- Come on, everybody!

64
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:58,321
Found it! We found it!

65
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,505
Hold it very tightly.
That's good.

66
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:25,218
I think they'll have
to take out her appendix.

67
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:28,687
- My appendix?
- No, you'll be fine. She'll be fine.

68
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,781
- Just please don't hurt me!
- Just repeat atter me, Madeline.

69
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:32,849
I can do anything.

70
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:37,027
Only patients from here on, madame.
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:39,589
- But I must stay with her!
- Wait!

72
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,191
- Please!
- I'll be right outside!

73
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:43,532
I can do anything.

74
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,369
- Are you her mother?
- No, I'm not.

75
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,170
I'm her teacher.

76
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,040
And where are her parents?

77
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:53,046
She's a ward of the church.
She has no parents.

78
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:56,845
- They died when she was very small.
- Oh. Here.

79
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:05,248
I can do anything.

80
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:18,495
We won't be visiting for long. It's only
been a few days since the operation.

81
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:21,871
Madeline will be exhausted.

82
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:23,876
We must be gentle with her.

83
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,893
- Hi, everybody.
- You're okay.

84
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:50,095
Madeline, you tricked us!

85
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:51,661
Look at that dollhouse!

86
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,004
- Oh, girls, your flowers.
- Vicki, she's got as many toys as you.

87
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:59,069
Yes, but these aren't hers.
They're for charity cases.

88
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:00,477
Look!

89
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,243
- It's a crank!
- Chantal!

90
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:05,683
- Glad you made it.
- Yes, we were super, super worried.

91
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,189
- Was it scary?
- Did you see a white light?

92
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:11,622
They cut a three-inch hole in me...

93
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:15,526
and then they stuck their bare hands in
and pulled out my guts.

94
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,793
- You're so lucky.
- Please.

95
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,935
All right. I was asleep.

96
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:26,439
So basically, all you did
was take a long nap.

97
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:29,704
Wait. I haven't shown you
the best part yet.

98
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:34,606
Look. Come over here.

99
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,980
Come and look.

100
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:41,044
Look what they gave me
in exchange for my appendix.

101
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:46,557
It's not that big.

102
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,822
Are you kidding? It's huge!

103
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,330
It's gi-normous!

104
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:53,559
All right, girls.
We'll say our good-byes now.

105
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,966
Madeline's had a hectic
and sleepless evening.

106
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:58,630
She's emotionally drained
and needs her rest.

107
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:00,697
Bye, Madeline.

108
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,177
- Can we visit Lady Covington?
- Not today, Aggie.

109
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,561
Please report to surgery,
room 24 immediately.

110
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,790
Lady Covington?

111
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,457
Hi, there, Madeline.

112
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,930
- You remember me?
- Of course I remember you...

113
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,263
from my visit last Easter.

114
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,269
- Yes.
- Come in.

115
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:08,400
I heard one of our girls
was in this hospital.

116
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:11,936
Are you feeling better?

117
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,814
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:20,253
I hope...

119
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,721
they are giving you
a lot of ice cream.

120
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,385
They are. I hope they're giving you
a lot of ice cream as well.

121
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,054
Not much.

122
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:33,566
- Are you teeling better?
- Much better.

123
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:38,936
You know, Madeline,
my grandmother started the school...

124
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:42,965
and I was a student there myself
when I was a little girl.

125
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:48,014
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yes.

126
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,315
When I was nine,
on the baseboard in the dortoir...

127
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:56,584
I carved my name.

128
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:59,649
You carved "Lady Covington"?

129
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:05,927
No, my name was Marie Gilbert.

130
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,938
- See if it's still there.
- Marie Gilbert.

131
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:13,940
Who gave you permission
to be in here?

132
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:16,772
Nobody, Lord Covington.

133
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:19,369
This is a hospital.
It's not a playroom.

134
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,471
You're not allowed
to just wander around.

135
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:23,482
Yes, sir.

136
00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:36,486
Something is not right.

137
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,071
What? What is it?

138
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:56,208
We want our appendix out too!

139
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:00,653
Good night, little girls.

140
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:03,781
Thank the Lord you are well.

141
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:06,257
Now, please, go to sleep!

142
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,562
Good night, good night, Miss Clavel.

143
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,808
Wait, Miss Clavel.

144
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,241
But that's Lady Covington's room.

145
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,678
Did she get better
and go home as well?

146
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:29,682
No, Madeline.

147
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,119
Lady Covington...

148
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:38,682
Lady Covington passed away.

149
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:41,686
But I only just spoke to her.

150
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:48,229
She was very sick.
We'll miss her very much.

151
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:51,737
I'm sorry.

152
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,542
Are you all right?

153
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,465
My first husband was a truck driver.
Stupid man!

154
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,143
What's your name?

155
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,571
Is this a pet chicken?

156
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,482
You know the rule, Madeline.
No pets allowed.

157
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:42,449
- Then what's it for?
- What is it for?

158
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:45,617
What do you think it's for, dancing?
It's for eating.

159
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:47,159
For eating?

160
00:14:47,227 --> 00:14:49,525
In honor of your return, Madeline...

161
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,791
we'll have Chicken Helene.

162
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,805
Enough is enough.

163
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:28,261
- Hello, street. Hello, house, vines.
- Take care, Madeline.

164
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:31,930
Madeline, the Spanish ambassador
is moving in next door.

165
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:38,003
Wait! Hat, wait!

166
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:49,988
The Spanish ambassador's a midget?

167
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:53,921
This is Pepito,
the Spanish ambassador's son.

168
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,099
We're off to the races!
No leaving the courtyard!

169
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:15,104
That boy's bad hat.

170
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,582
No, I don't think you should
judge people too quickly.

171
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:20,518
But I guess
I understood him quickly.

172
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:35,901
So you're Pepito, eh?

173
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:47,002
He's positively Elvis!

174
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,477
Don't give him any attention.
He he's bad hat.

175
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,478
- I like his hat,
- And, Madeline, you're so young.

176
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,444
This boy's got charisma.

177
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,885
- But is he intelligent?
- Who cares? He's got a motorcycle.

178
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,452
- It's a Vespa.
- He'll probably get run over someday.

179
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,021
He is sort of handsome.

180
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,330
Forget it, Aggie.
You don't stand a chance.

181
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,333
Nobody wants a chance, Vicki,
except for you.

182
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,072
"He's got charisma."

183
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:16,901
You're all googly-eyed.

184
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:18,874
I am not googly-eyed!

185
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:21,780
He'll see us!

186
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,362
Amen.

187
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:44,831
Tonight, Madeline, I made
your very favorite: Chicken Helene.

188
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:48,636
- Great!
- Oh, super!

189
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:52,702
- It looks great, Helene.
- Yes.

190
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:54,713
Smells gorgeous.

191
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:59,442
Oh, no. Fred.

192
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,454
Who's Fred?

193
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:04,956
That's Fred.

194
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:08,483
- The chicken?
- Chickens don't have names.

195
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:11,326
- How do you know?
- Madeline, aren't you hungry?

196
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:13,889
I've suddenly lost my appetite.

197
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,527
You see, this chicken
was a friend of mine.

198
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:21,666
I met him earlier in the car.
I think I'm a vegetarian.

199
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:24,074
This is just too idiotic.

200
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,739
If you knew the chicken the way I did,
Vicki, you wouldn't eat him.

201
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:30,681
Of course I would.
He's nice and crispy...

202
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,685
just the way I like him.

203
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,812
Well, I'm not eating Fred.

204
00:18:34,888 --> 00:18:36,913
Fred's already dead. Look.

205
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,823
Well, I think
I'm a "vegetable-arian" too.

206
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,224
I can't eat it either.

207
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,888
What's going on?

208
00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:46,023
Who is Fred? I don't understand.

209
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:48,397
I'm sorry, Helene,
but you killed him.

210
00:18:57,444 --> 00:19:00,174
Well, I wasn't friends with Fred.

211
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:28,406
Eat it, Lolo!

212
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,807
Don't be one of them.
Eat it!

213
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:33,971
Everyone is entitled
to her opinion.

214
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,981
If Vicki wants to eat Fred...

215
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,778
the chicken...

216
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:46,859
May I ask what's going on?

217
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,726
Excuse us, my lord.

218
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:58,293
You found us in the middle
of a debate.

219
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:01,140
A debate.

220
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,201
Miss Clavel, I wonder
if I might have a word with you.

221
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:15,253
What's Lord Cuckoo Butt doing here?

222
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:18,519
- Lord Covington.
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,583
On behalf of myself
and the girls...

224
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,185
I would like to offer you
our deepest sympathy.

225
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,663
Thank you very much, Miss Clavel.

226
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,868
The girls.

227
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,138
Yes. I'm afraid
they lack discipline.

228
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:38,833
They are usually very well-behaved,
it I may say so.

229
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:42,404
You may say so,
but it is not my experience.

230
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:45,974
I've been going through
my wife's papers...

231
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:48,282
putting her final affairs
in order.

232
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:52,018
This must be a very difficult time
for you.

233
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:54,424
In 43 years of marriage...

234
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,697
the only thing that my wife and I
ever disagreed upon...

235
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,125
was her indulgence of this school.

236
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,465
It needed a new roof,
my wife wrote a check.

237
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:12,478
Cook needed a new refrigerator,
my wife wrote a check.

238
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:15,174
Trips to the zoo.

239
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:18,046
She was a wondertully
generous woman.

240
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:20,678
Well, it can't go on like this.

241
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:23,487
I'm closing the school down.

242
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,255
But the girls.

243
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:32,360
Will find another school to attend.

244
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:37,129
Eating chicken's not the same
as wearing leather shoes.

245
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:38,637
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

246
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:40,639
End of debate!

247
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:43,767
If you won't eat your chicken,
it's off to bed with you.

248
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,616
- What did we do?
- No dinner at all?

249
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:10,236
"Marie Gilbert."

250
00:22:10,303 --> 00:22:13,067
- Who's that?
- A friend of mine.

251
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:17,235
- I'm super hungry.
- You're "super" everything.

252
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,337
It's better to be super everything
than super nothing.

253
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:25,145
I don't think I'm super,
super everything.

254
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,278
All right. We're all hungry.

255
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,084
So let's eat.

256
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:32,351
But we're not allowed.

257
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:35,087
Pooh-pooh. Come on.

258
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:39,391
I still don't think
we should do this.

259
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:47,331
In the French resistance, we knew
how to deal with a man like Cuckoo Face.

260
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:51,808
Oh, Helene, don't even joke
about such things.

261
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:54,312
Who is joking?

262
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:05,449
Shh! If they hear us,
we're dead meat.

263
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:08,050
- But we're vegetarians.
- Shh! Stop whispering!

264
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:10,062
You stop whispering!

265
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,432
- It's Helene's knickers.
- It's her bra.

266
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:18,336
Her booby baskets.

267
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,133
Boobies, boobies, boobies.

268
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:25,609
- Mmm, pickle sandwiches.
- Are dairy products all right?

269
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:30,312
Yuck. Super bad smell.

270
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:32,442
All right, who did it?

271
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,453
- Smells like one of Vicki's.
- I need air.

272
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:36,148
- Phew!
- Gross!

273
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:39,453
- Aggie.
- She who smelt it dealt it.

274
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:43,826
- Chantal.
- It's not me. It's this.

275
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:46,388
Nobody breathe!
It's Helene's special cheese.

276
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:50,402
- Close it!
- Give me a Jack!

277
00:23:51,871 --> 00:23:53,805
Go fish!

278
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:59,040
Chicken Helene. Chicken.

279
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,694
Now what's for dessert?

280
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:24,335
We can bake a cake.

281
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:33,405
Come back here, you!
I don't care who your father is.

282
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,574
We're not in Spain.
We're not gonna take this.

283
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:40,045
If you think you scare me,
well, you don't!

284
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:50,656
- It is an outrage!
- We were just getting something to eat.

285
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,099
It's all Pepito's fault.

286
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:13,251
Who's going to clean up this mess?

287
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,480
We are, Miss Clavel.

288
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,955
And then what do you suggest?

289
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,888
We eat!

290
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:32,495
All right, but from now on
I do the cooking, okay?

291
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,506
Hop, hop!

292
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:24,089
Hello... A nun!

293
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,790
Leopold's the name.

294
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,518
Tutoring's the game.

295
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:32,489
I'm Pepito's new tutor.

296
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:34,890
I'm Miss Clavel
from the school next door.

297
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:38,295
Pepito appears to be
a handful.

298
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:41,534
It seems he needs an outlet
for his energy.

299
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:44,076
Well, we all do, don't we?

300
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,578
I thought he might appreciate this.

301
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,581
It's a toolbox.

302
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,947
Cheers.

303
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:54,077
Do you mind if we talk
a little shop?

304
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,351
These kids...

305
00:26:57,423 --> 00:27:01,757
What do you do to keep 'em occupied,
out of your hair, so to speak?

306
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,991
Well, tomorrow, for instance,
I'm taking mine to the museum.

307
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:07,225
The museum.

308
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,200
Not bad.

309
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:12,097
What do you do on your day off?

310
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:16,007
I pray.

311
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,589
Despite being rather tiny in size...

312
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,567
Emperor Napoleon held France
in an iron grip.

313
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:46,332
I don't want you
to simply copy the painting.

314
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:49,170
I want you to loosen up.

315
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:52,302
Express yourselves. Go wild.

316
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,544
You have exactly 20 minutes. Draw.

317
00:28:02,655 --> 00:28:05,089
Madeline, where is your drawing pad?

318
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:08,389
Oops. I left it in the other gallery.

319
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:11,590
- I know where it is.
- Are you sure?

320
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,299
- Yes.
- Then you may go and retrieve it.

321
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:09,450
Where are you going, little girl?

322
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:13,014
I asked you a question.

323
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:15,686
What's the matter? Scared?

324
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,788
I wasn't scared of you, Pepito.

325
00:29:19,732 --> 00:29:21,290
Were you looking for this?

326
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:22,891
That's mine!

327
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,802
- Hey, I know it's yours.
- You stole it.

328
00:29:25,872 --> 00:29:29,035
I was gonna give it back. You should
say "thank you," don't you think?

329
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:31,406
Give it to me.

330
00:29:31,477 --> 00:29:35,345
Keep it down.
Some of us are trying to sleep.

331
00:29:36,783 --> 00:29:38,978
Adios, little girl.

332
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,864
"Beware"?

333
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:04,535
Beware of what?

334
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,309
Girls, we've received an invitation
from our new neighbor.

335
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:13,284
"His Excellency,
the Ambassador of Spain...

336
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,548
requests your presence
for atternoon tea...

337
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:18,089
to celebrate the tenth birthday
of his son."

338
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:21,354
But we can't go.
The message said "beware"!

339
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:23,622
It's a trap.
We'll never make it out alive.

340
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,188
Of course we're going.
We never get invited anywhere.

341
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:29,359
Vicki's right.

342
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:31,266
We can't let him frighten us off.

343
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:34,604
- It's only a boy, girls.
- Please, don't go in there!

344
00:30:34,674 --> 00:30:37,108
- But they are beginning a class!
- Excuse me, Miss Clavel.

345
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:39,406
Now this is the room
that requires some attention.

346
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:44,212
- May I help you, Lord Covington?
- May I ask you what these marks are?

347
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:46,649
Those are for keeping track
of the girls' heights.

348
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:49,913
Paint them over!

349
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:51,616
Excuse me!

350
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:56,291
We have just begun our class.

351
00:30:56,362 --> 00:30:59,661
Well, perhaps you'd be kind enough
to reconvene elsewhere, Miss Clavel.

352
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,427
Go on.

353
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,773
Downstairs, girls.

354
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:11,309
In an orderly fashion.

355
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:16,782
Ah, young ladies.

356
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,443
Right. You, paint it over.

357
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,428
No matter what you wear, Vicki,
you always look super gorgeous.

358
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:42,963
You can wear whatever you like
to the party tomorrow.

359
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,669
I know what I'll be wearing.

360
00:31:44,744 --> 00:31:48,680
Don't worry, Miss Clavel.
One of us will look smashing.

361
00:31:59,926 --> 00:32:01,791
Look at my dress.

362
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,366
Girls.

363
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:19,841
Hello.

364
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:23,404
Oh, you all look so charming!

365
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:26,484
Girls.

366
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,562
Slowly. Girls.

367
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:45,003
Pepito, they're here.

368
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:51,500
Ladies, may I present the reason
we have opened to you our home.

369
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:53,738
Our birthday boy...

370
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:57,510
Señor José Marco
Filippo Juan Franloco...

371
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,050
Lopez de Vega...

372
00:32:59,118 --> 00:33:01,052
Esteban Machado...

373
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,611
Jorge Santiago de la Rocha...

374
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:06,214
Gaspar Carlos de Fuentes...

375
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:08,954
Coruna Diego y Sevilla.

376
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:16,466
Of course,
his friends call him Pepito.

377
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,798
What friends?

378
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,237
Señoritas, you honor me
with your presence.

379
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:24,276
Your limousine is waiting, sir.

380
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:26,811
Do excuse us.
I wish we could stay.

381
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,541
- Happy birthday.
- Bye-bye, darling.

382
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:31,708
- Do you have the tickets?
- Yes.

383
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,656
I think you look
very handsome, Pepito.

384
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:43,252
But no one told us
this was a costume party.

385
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,388
This is not a costume.

386
00:33:45,464 --> 00:33:48,365
This is the uniform
of a Spanish toreador...

387
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:52,097
the great heroes
of the coliseums de Madrid.

388
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:54,105
He's a bullfighter.

389
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:57,233
Those must be some
pretty small bulls.

390
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,575
Please.
You're not a real bullfighter.

391
00:34:02,848 --> 00:34:06,579
Señoritas, allow me
to show you my menagerie.

392
00:34:10,456 --> 00:34:12,390
What's a menagerie?

393
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:22,159
You damn idiot!
I'll get him to the circus.

394
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:24,725
- That's not your concern.
- I don't know.

395
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:27,864
You just stick with the plan,
and we'll all be rich.

396
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,703
I must talk to my brothers
about this.

397
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:33,667
Look, no worries, mate.
He's as good as delivered.

398
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:52,057
Do you happen to know my uncle?

399
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,565
He's the British ambassador
in Madrid.

400
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:57,795
Is there meant to be a clown
at the party?

401
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,168
The only clown here is you.

402
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,483
What's in there, Pepito?

403
00:35:15,554 --> 00:35:17,749
It's a surprise.

404
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:26,732
I'm not afraid of mice.

405
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:29,359
No? Perhaps you're afraid
of the snake...

406
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:32,495
that's gonna have this mouse
for lunch.

407
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:36,666
You wouldn't feed a live mouse
to that snake.

408
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:39,336
Of course not.
That would be cruel.

409
00:35:39,412 --> 00:35:42,074
But what I would do
is execute him...

410
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:44,116
with the guillotine I built.

411
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,022
It's quick, silent and deadly.

412
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:54,457
Like Helene's cheese.

413
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,358
It's just an innocent little mouse!

414
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,696
I'll show you!

415
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,134
It was just a joke!

416
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,301
Girls? Girls?

417
00:36:16,148 --> 00:36:18,446
Stupid idiot!

418
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,147
Look.

419
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,626
Come back here! I'll get you!

420
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:30,924
Drop that rat, bullfighter!

421
00:36:30,996 --> 00:36:33,089
Stop it this instant!

422
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:37,829
- I'll get you!
- If you can't behave, we're leaving now.

423
00:36:44,844 --> 00:36:46,277
Girls.

424
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,354
What about the cake?

425
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,774
There's only 197.

426
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,781
Begin again.

427
00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:27,114
Thanks a lot, Madeline.

428
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:30,348
I've never been so humiliated.

429
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:32,583
Can you believe them?

430
00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:34,387
And that poor carrot.

431
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,985
Trust Madeline to get us all
in trouble.

432
00:37:37,062 --> 00:37:39,462
It was a super bad punishment.

433
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:40,965
He deserved it.

434
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:44,833
He was about to kill a live
baby mouse right in front of us.

435
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:47,668
But he did say he was joking.

436
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,332
Aggie.

437
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:53,105
What do you think?
I've been praying for inspiration.

438
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:56,148
- Yes. I can see that.
- You don't like it?

439
00:37:56,215 --> 00:37:59,514
Listen to me.

440
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:00,950
It's not my fault.

441
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,649
The boy's bad hat.
How can you take his side?

442
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:07,692
Have you all gone mad?
I did the right thing.

443
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,320
The boy kills bulls.
He kills mice.

444
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:12,796
- He's a maniac.
- Very interesting.

445
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:16,357
I'll show that bullfighter,
that mouse-killer.

446
00:38:16,435 --> 00:38:19,029
I'll fight him myself!

447
00:38:19,104 --> 00:38:21,231
- Yes, Aggie.
- Take that, Pepito! And that!

448
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:36,046
- Look!
- Somebody help her!

449
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:39,557
- Help!
- The current is taking her!

450
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:45,594
You can do it!

451
00:38:45,664 --> 00:38:48,462
- Keep your head up!
- Help!

452
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:55,504
Where is she?

453
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,203
Help!

454
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,850
Follow me! Girls, quickly!

455
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:15,850
Help!

456
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:18,362
Quickly!

457
00:39:20,165 --> 00:39:22,258
Not too fast!

458
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:29,805
- Madeline!
- There's a dog! Look!

459
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,432
Thank you.

460
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:04,770
Oh, Madeline! Hold on tight.

461
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:09,679
The dog. Where's the dog?

462
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:13,013
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

463
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,525
I was so scared.

464
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:32,003
Tea, soup and covers.

465
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:34,403
I want you to stay under the covers...

466
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,408
eat your soup and drink your tea.

467
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,341
You're giving me gray hair.

468
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:41,504
- Can I see?
- No!

469
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:46,309
Stay in bed.

470
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:48,319
Bye, Madeline.

471
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:04,559
Miss Clavel, can I stay home tomorrow?
I'm feeling sick.

472
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:06,900
- No, Aggie.
- Please.

473
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:12,305
Leopold, where are my keys?

474
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:24,854
- Could you please find my keys?
- All right. Pipe down.

475
00:41:24,923 --> 00:41:28,017
- Can you or not? I can't start.
- You don't need a bloody key.

476
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:31,153
- You can use a paper clip. Watch.
- Oh, yeah, right.

477
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:38,536
It worked.

478
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,623
You found me!

479
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,629
Genevieve. Genevieve.

480
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,859
You found me.
I never thought you would. Thank you.

481
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:10,766
Well, I think you'll find
it's in immaculate condition.

482
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:13,566
The house was built in 1852.

483
00:42:17,676 --> 00:42:19,439
It's charming, isn't it?

484
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:22,537
Property's been in my late wife's family
for generations.

485
00:42:22,614 --> 00:42:24,775
What a place to invite your guests.

486
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:30,016
- You don't have any children?
- No, just the two of us.

487
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,718
Let's start in the dining room.
If you'd be kind enough to follow me.

488
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:37,489
The house has been used for the past
few decades as a school for girls.

489
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,661
Hence the sensible furniture.

490
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:46,227
- What a spacious dining room.
- Oh, such a beautitul portrait.

491
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:49,604
- Is that your wife?
- It's my late wife, yes.

492
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:52,269
She was very lovely.

493
00:42:52,344 --> 00:42:54,812
Yes, indeed she was.

494
00:42:58,317 --> 00:43:00,945
Shall we go and have a look
at the kitchen?

495
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:03,010
It has all the modern conveniences.

496
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:09,752
Kitchens are my staff's business.
I never set foot in them.

497
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:12,092
Please, just reassure me
that you have one.

498
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:16,430
We have one.
Now this room speaks for itself.

499
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:18,629
The music room.

500
00:43:18,704 --> 00:43:22,140
Yes, I think you'll agree
it has an air of real sophistication.

501
00:43:23,408 --> 00:43:27,367
- Splendid.
- So, upstairs?

502
00:43:27,446 --> 00:43:29,676
And have a look at these doors.

503
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:32,512
Solid oak.
They don't make them like this anymore.

504
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,013
Now.

505
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:42,049
And so we arrive at yet another room
with the most elegant proportions.

506
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:44,061
Think how splendid it'll be...

507
00:43:44,129 --> 00:43:47,121
to see the Liberian flag
fluttering out of that window.

508
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,632
Indeed.

509
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,793
Well, Lord Covington,
I see nothing to prevent us...

510
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:53,667
from purchasing
this magniticent house.

511
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:57,808
Did you hear something, Desmond?

512
00:43:59,645 --> 00:44:03,103
I can assure you,
the neighborhood is uniquely peaceful.

513
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,207
What is that sound?

514
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:11,887
That boy down there!

515
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:16,890
The Spanish ambassador's son.

516
00:44:19,331 --> 00:44:22,926
We had a terrible little boy
next door to us in Ouagadougou.

517
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:27,099
The worst three years of my life.

518
00:44:27,172 --> 00:44:30,938
He never slept.
Not ever.

519
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:33,443
I'm sorry.
This just won't work.

520
00:44:33,512 --> 00:44:35,946
I should warn you
that I've had inquiries...

521
00:44:36,014 --> 00:44:39,108
from a number
of other foreign diplomats.

522
00:44:39,184 --> 00:44:41,618
Under no circumstances.
Never again.

523
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:44,087
I'll get rid of the boy.
He's a pest.

524
00:44:44,156 --> 00:44:46,090
I'll speak to the Spanish government.

525
00:44:56,868 --> 00:45:00,895
Did you know that Joan of Arc was burned
at the stake when she was only 19?

526
00:45:00,973 --> 00:45:04,306
Girls, vite, vite.
Now go to bed.

527
00:45:04,376 --> 00:45:06,867
Listen, everybody.
I have something to tell you.

528
00:45:06,945 --> 00:45:09,106
I'm gonna be burnt
at the stake too someday.

529
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:11,809
- What a neat way to die!
- You're all nuts.

530
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:13,783
- Yeah. Cashews.
- Bless you.

531
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:16,446
No, really. This is a big secret.

532
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:18,284
The dog from the river!

533
00:45:19,992 --> 00:45:21,721
Oh, look!

534
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:23,727
- I told you, you should stay.
- How sweet.

535
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:26,593
- He's so cute.
- I'll give him my bow.

536
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:29,065
So this is the big secret.

537
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:31,432
No, this is not about Genevieve.

538
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:33,903
- Great name.
- We'll never be able to keep her.

539
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:45,478
Something is not right.

540
00:45:59,698 --> 00:46:01,962
I don't think she'll find her.

541
00:46:11,677 --> 00:46:15,340
- What's going on, girls?
- Nothing!

542
00:46:15,414 --> 00:46:17,678
We're not hiding anything!

543
00:46:17,749 --> 00:46:20,377
I'll tell you what's going on.
Lord Cuckoo Face is...

544
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:22,044
- Covington.
- Cuckoo Face.

545
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:26,323
He's going to sell the school.
I heard it.

546
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:30,457
Is it true?

547
00:46:31,763 --> 00:46:33,731
Yes, girls.

548
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:36,529
Lord Covington
intends to sell the school.

549
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:40,969
- But that's terrible! He can't.
- Why?

550
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:49,075
Please.

551
00:46:56,588 --> 00:47:01,548
All of this is no reason for us
to stop acting like proper young ladies.

552
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:04,026
We will not fall to pieces.

553
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:05,927
We will maintain composure.

554
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:10,058
Lord Covington
is showing the house tomorrow...

555
00:47:10,135 --> 00:47:12,194
and I intend for it to be spo...

556
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:22,245
spotless.

557
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:23,838
Bless you.

558
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:26,748
Thank you. Good night.

559
00:47:29,554 --> 00:47:32,216
And another thing.

560
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,781
All of you young ladies know
that there is a strict rule...

561
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,192
against pets in the school.

562
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:40,390
What you do not know is that
I am highly allergic to dogs.

563
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:49,298
Your new friend can sleep
in the garden shed.

564
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:53,476
Now go to...

565
00:47:55,547 --> 00:47:57,310
bed.

566
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:02,752
I can't believe she let us keep her.

567
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:09,490
- She's just a dog from the street.
- She's the most beautitul dog.

568
00:48:09,561 --> 00:48:12,428
I can't believe
they're closing the school.

569
00:48:12,497 --> 00:48:14,795
We'll never see each other again.

570
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:16,299
It's not fair.

571
00:48:16,368 --> 00:48:18,302
Close the school.

572
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,828
That Cuckoo Face is super wicked.

573
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:23,966
Chantal, what are you doing?

574
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,737
Trying to find some way out of this.

575
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:28,609
You only just found out
how to tie your shoelaces.

576
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,444
Well, I think we're all being
terribly selfish.

577
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:35,247
Just think of poor,
pathetic Madeline.

578
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,153
She doesn't have any family at all.

579
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:40,123
Yeah, think of Madeline.

580
00:48:40,192 --> 00:48:43,389
I can't believe she just said that.
She's not pathetic.

581
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,023
I'm sure you'll find someplace
to stay, Madeline.

582
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:50,397
I'm staying right here.
We all are.

583
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,688
You three on construction.

584
00:49:14,759 --> 00:49:18,388
Aggie, you and Chantal
cover the kitchen.

585
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,330
And you two on dog patrol.

586
00:49:21,399 --> 00:49:24,459
And the rest of you, fall out.

587
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:31,773
And I'll negotiate with Spain.

588
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:36,046
Hurry up.

589
00:49:37,382 --> 00:49:39,316
Yes, Vicki.

590
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,723
Come on, Genevieve.

591
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:50,694
Bye-bye.

592
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:25,022
- You want me to go and break it up?
- No, look.

593
00:50:28,133 --> 00:50:31,660
That boy is simply misunderstood.

594
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,708
The property's been in my late wife's
family for generations.

595
00:50:46,785 --> 00:50:50,915
The house has been used for the past
tew decades as a school for girls.

596
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:53,287
Say hello to Lord Covington, girls.

597
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:56,225
Good morning, Lord Covington.

598
00:50:58,964 --> 00:51:02,127
Young ladies.

599
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,292
Miss Clavel.

600
00:51:04,803 --> 00:51:06,794
Charming.

601
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:14,608
Hear the song of the nightingale

602
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:19,275
Singing beautifully

603
00:51:19,351 --> 00:51:21,979
Everyone who listens to her song

604
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:23,953
Sings along

605
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:27,458
And think how lovely it will be to have
the Indian flag fluttering on the lawn.

606
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,823
- Now this is the music room.
- Oh, yes.

607
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:33,830
There is good karma here.

608
00:51:41,106 --> 00:51:43,404
What is that smell?

609
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,409
I can't smell anything.

610
00:51:48,913 --> 00:51:51,609
What? Don't look at me.

611
00:51:51,683 --> 00:51:53,878
Oh, come on, Gopal.

612
00:51:56,688 --> 00:51:59,657
Have a look at these doors.
Solid oak, huh?

613
00:51:59,724 --> 00:52:01,624
They don't make them
like this anymore.

614
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:07,064
That's probably a good thing.

615
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:14,202
Now the garden.
Do come have a look at the garden.

616
00:52:14,272 --> 00:52:17,070
- Oh, yes.
- It's most delightful.

617
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:20,578
Smiling happily

618
00:52:22,113 --> 00:52:24,005
lmmaculate lawns, of course.

619
00:52:26,484 --> 00:52:30,545
Such peace. Such tranquility.

620
00:52:31,623 --> 00:52:33,853
It's true.

621
00:52:33,925 --> 00:52:35,392
Well...

622
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:45,893
Dance, you suckers!

623
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,835
Dance!

624
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:56,080
Look! It's Pepito!

625
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,449
No, please! Please reconsider!

626
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:09,420
The Uzbekistani ambassador
will be arriving soon!

627
00:53:09,494 --> 00:53:12,486
I know he means business!
Please reconsider!

628
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:21,571
We did it!

629
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:23,800
It was really funny.
He was, like...

630
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,648
What exactly did you say to Pepito
this morning, Madeline?

631
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,180
All I said is that we were having some
very important guests this morning...

632
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:44,456
so could you pretty please
be very quiet at that time?

633
00:54:32,277 --> 00:54:34,211
Wait! Stop the car!

634
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,882
If I may say so,
your little boy is a menace!

635
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,322
- Your Excellency.
- I want an explanation.

636
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,029
Why did this loco fellow
say our Pepito is a menace?

637
00:54:59,103 --> 00:55:00,968
I have no idea.

638
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,531
Pepito is a sweet,
well-behaved child.

639
00:55:04,609 --> 00:55:08,010
There's just one problem
with Pepito.

640
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,913
- What is that?
- He needs some diversion.

641
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:14,850
He spends all day cooped up
in the house studying.

642
00:55:14,919 --> 00:55:16,887
I'm teaching him Latin.

643
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:19,287
I'm teaching him biology,
algebration...

644
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,622
calculometry, physiconomy
and astrology.

645
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,889
But he can hardly read.

646
00:55:24,963 --> 00:55:27,693
No, he's taken huge leaps.

647
00:55:27,765 --> 00:55:30,598
- How wondertul!
- So, um...

648
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:34,968
As a reward for all his hard work,
I'm gonna take him to the circus.

649
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:36,973
The circus?

650
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:39,669
I love the circus.
We'll all go to the circus.

651
00:55:39,744 --> 00:55:42,645
Oh, great idea.
We will all go!

652
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:46,013
Look, no.
Just me and Pepito.

653
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:47,517
Damn!

654
00:55:55,693 --> 00:55:58,628
Ah, Miss Clavel.
I wonder if I could have a moment.

655
00:55:58,696 --> 00:56:01,988
Lord Covington,
do you have any idea what time it is?

656
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:04,462
- The girls are asleep.
- I'll be brief then.

657
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:07,231
Here are 12 letters,
one for each one of your pupils.

658
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:09,334
Kindly see that they reach
the parents.

659
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:13,043
I'm informing them I shall be closing
the school at the end of the term.

660
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,544
That's quite enough, Miss Clavel!

661
00:56:14,612 --> 00:56:17,706
After your little act of sabotage
this morning, I am in no...

662
00:56:17,782 --> 00:56:20,615
Miss Clavel wasn't the one
who did it. I was.

663
00:56:20,685 --> 00:56:22,448
Go back to bed, Madeline.

664
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,852
Please see that those letters are
delivered tirst thing in the morning.

665
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:28,757
You can't sell the school,
Lord Cuckoo Face. You can't.

666
00:56:33,464 --> 00:56:35,398
What did you call me?

667
00:56:35,466 --> 00:56:37,764
Lord, um, Covington.

668
00:56:37,835 --> 00:56:40,929
Oh, no, you didn't.
You called me Lord "Cuckoo Face."

669
00:56:41,005 --> 00:56:43,098
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

670
00:56:43,174 --> 00:56:44,971
Yes, she did.

671
00:56:46,377 --> 00:56:47,469
I heard you!

672
00:56:49,147 --> 00:56:53,584
Miss Clavel,
don't you teach your little brats...

673
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:55,585
even the slightest respect
for their elders?

674
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:59,316
They are not brats, Lord Covington.
They are young ladies.

675
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:03,385
They respect their elders
between 7:00 in the morning...

676
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,622
and 9:00 in the evening
when they go to sleep.

677
00:57:05,697 --> 00:57:08,757
This is insubordination, Miss Clavel.

678
00:57:10,902 --> 00:57:12,836
Madeline, please go to bed.

679
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:19,509
Is this your resignation?

680
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:30,113
As long as there are children here,
Lord Covington, I will teach them.

681
00:57:31,422 --> 00:57:33,356
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

682
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:37,459
We won't be needing this one.

683
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:39,462
Madeline has no family.

684
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:07,289
They have an animal.

685
00:58:36,988 --> 00:58:39,218
Gotcha.

686
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:41,053
He's leaving!

687
00:58:44,195 --> 00:58:46,686
And he's taking Genevieve away too!

688
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:52,864
Leave her alone!

689
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:57,603
Sir, leave Genevieve alone!

690
00:58:57,675 --> 00:58:59,905
No, Lord Cuckoo Face, no!

691
00:58:59,977 --> 00:59:02,946
Come on! I can't hear you!

692
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:08,377
Now get out of here, you beast!

693
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:12,218
Come away from the window.

694
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,656
We have to go get her!

695
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:18,752
- Girls, please!
- We have to get Genevieve now.

696
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,764
It is the middle of the night.

697
00:59:20,832 --> 00:59:23,892
You are little girls and you know
I won't allow you to go out.

698
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:28,031
Genevieve will be all right
for one night.

699
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,040
We'll find her tomorrow.

700
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,303
Now, to bed.

701
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,814
Noblest dog in France,
you shall have your vengeance!

702
01:00:02,173 --> 01:00:03,902
Where can she be?

703
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,535
But, Miss Clavel,
it isn't 9:30 yet.

704
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:09,273
Never mind, Serena.
We have a dog to find.

705
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:17,354
- Wait for Vicki!
- I didn't get to brush my hair.

706
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:20,356
She's about so big,
with a pink bow in her hair.

707
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:24,326
She's really brave
and a fabulous swimmer.

708
01:00:24,395 --> 01:00:28,695
She runs really fast,
and she's got big golden eyes.

709
01:00:28,766 --> 01:00:32,327
She's got floppy ears and...

710
01:00:32,403 --> 01:00:35,304
Well, I can't tell you any more,
but please find her.

711
01:00:35,373 --> 01:00:36,806
You did very well.

712
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:44,473
- Have you seen our dog, Genevieve?
- No, I haven't.

713
01:00:48,819 --> 01:00:51,583
Have you seen our dog?

714
01:00:51,656 --> 01:00:54,989
- She's quite skinny.
- And she's about that big.

715
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:57,323
And it's a labrador...
um, a golden retriever.

716
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,562
Are you sure?

717
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,840
She's gone. Genevieve's gone.

718
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:17,711
No, she's not.
We'll find her. I promise you.

719
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,383
We have to have faith.

720
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:24,182
I used to wish so hard
for my parents to be alive again...

721
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:27,156
but you can't make something happen
just by wishing for it.

722
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:29,859
Genevieve's gone.

723
01:01:29,927 --> 01:01:33,055
She doesn't have a home.
She needs a home.

724
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,757
I know she does.

725
01:01:34,832 --> 01:01:36,595
I need a home too.

726
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:39,534
Madeline, you will always
have a home.

727
01:01:39,604 --> 01:01:42,368
Yes, but it won't always
be with you, will it?

728
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,508
Will it?

729
01:01:48,045 --> 01:01:52,846
There's no place on earth I'd rather be
than with you and the other girls.

730
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,078
You know that, don't you?

731
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:04,620
Get your tickets now!

732
01:02:05,863 --> 01:02:07,797
Last chance!

733
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:13,960
Cirque Pandora!

734
01:02:27,718 --> 01:02:30,243
I was in love once
with a carnival man.

735
01:02:30,321 --> 01:02:32,414
He broke my heart, you know.

736
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,789
And he had a beautitul
tattoo that...

737
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,091
Helene! Please.

738
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:40,790
All right, girls.

739
01:02:40,865 --> 01:02:45,564
Everyone stay with your partners
and let's have fun!

740
01:02:50,174 --> 01:02:52,108
Come, Madeline!

741
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:57,141
I want to get a teddy bear.

742
01:02:57,415 --> 01:03:01,408
Oh, yeah, and then one of those games
where you go...

743
01:03:01,485 --> 01:03:02,918
Bang, you're dead!

744
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,251
Ooh, and I want to get some candy!

745
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,626
I guess that means he's here.

746
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:19,296
Hello, Miss Clavel!

747
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:25,808
Up here!

748
01:03:36,754 --> 01:03:38,415
Come on, Madeline.

749
01:03:44,762 --> 01:03:49,358
And now, the Idiots Popopov!

750
01:04:05,549 --> 01:04:09,007
They're so stupid!
That's why they're idiots.

751
01:04:14,326 --> 01:04:16,050
Aggie...

752
01:04:16,627 --> 01:04:19,218
I have something to tell you.

753
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:21,890
I'm not going back with you.

754
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:24,901
You're not going back?

755
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:27,529
I'm running away with the circus.

756
01:04:27,605 --> 01:04:30,904
What are you talking about?
We have to go home.

757
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,674
I don't have a home, Aggie.
The school's closing, and it's my fault.

758
01:04:36,547 --> 01:04:39,675
The circus will be my new home.
All I have to do...

759
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,777
is learn to juggle or tame lions
or eat fire or something.

760
01:04:43,854 --> 01:04:45,788
But what about Miss Clavel?

761
01:04:45,856 --> 01:04:48,488
I'll write to her,
explaining everything.

762
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:52,361
You're my best friend
in the whole entire world.

763
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,625
You can't tell anyone
where I went.

764
01:04:54,698 --> 01:04:57,963
- But, Madeline...
- No buts. You've got to promise.

765
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,397
Do you promise,
Agatha Emily Walden?

766
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,041
I promise.

767
01:05:09,713 --> 01:05:11,271
Good luck, Madeline.

768
01:05:44,348 --> 01:05:46,373
No, really.
I don't want to play.

769
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:48,816
Oh, Carmen,
be a sport for once.

770
01:05:48,886 --> 01:05:52,185
- Go, Mom!
- Stay.

771
01:06:20,584 --> 01:06:23,781
- Whoa!
- Come on, let's go get a balloon.

772
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,084
- But I'm watching this.
- Come on!

773
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:29,216
- Ah, but please!
- Come on!

774
01:07:08,632 --> 01:07:11,533
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Quiet, kid.

775
01:07:18,342 --> 01:07:20,276
Oh, terrific.
It's Thumbelina.

776
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:22,005
Leave him alone, you!

777
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,571
I knew it.
You're not really a tutor.

778
01:07:25,649 --> 01:07:29,050
Give Pepito back right now,
or I'll go get Miss Clavel.

779
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:33,356
Miss Clavel!
I'm terrified, really.

780
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:03,213
- Have you seen Pepito?
- No, I don't know!

781
01:08:14,732 --> 01:08:16,927
Tie the knot, idiot!

782
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:20,129
Look, for the last time,
"Idiot" is a stage name. I'm Pierre.

783
01:08:20,204 --> 01:08:24,140
You won't get away with this. My father
will send the Spanish armada after you.

784
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:27,666
Your father will thank me,
you spoiled brat!

785
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,304
Take that, you idiot!

786
01:08:31,382 --> 01:08:34,613
I thought we were just
kidnapping one kid.

787
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:37,153
Two kids, two ransoms.

788
01:08:42,026 --> 01:08:45,689
- This is the life, eh?
- Get in the truck, idiot!

789
01:08:45,763 --> 01:08:47,196
And he's the smart one!

790
01:08:58,776 --> 01:09:01,210
One, two, three, four, tive, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven...

791
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:03,212
Twelve. All right.

792
01:09:11,221 --> 01:09:13,746
Help! Save us, somebody!

793
01:09:13,824 --> 01:09:16,759
- Help us!
- Please, someone!

794
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,868
My coat is just dripping.

795
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:38,038
Let's go upstairs and dry off.
We don't want anyone to catch pneumonia.

796
01:09:38,115 --> 01:09:41,312
- Miss Clavel?
- Aggie, what is it?

797
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:44,081
- She ran away.
- Who ran away?

798
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:47,817
Madeline. I tried to stop her.
I tried.

799
01:09:50,294 --> 01:09:51,522
Please, please.

800
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:45,278
As I said before, he was with us
all atternoon, and then...

801
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:50,016
... the clown in the act,
and then he was with his tutor.

802
01:10:50,087 --> 01:10:52,954
Oh, Miss Clavel!

803
01:10:53,023 --> 01:10:56,652
Señor Ambassador, have you seen
my smallest one? My Madeline?

804
01:10:56,727 --> 01:11:00,390
- Our Pepito's missing too.
- My baby!

805
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:03,058
Is it possible the young boy
and the young girl...

806
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,499
have run off together
on a romantic adventure?

807
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,504
- Absolutely not.
- It's impossible.

808
01:11:09,573 --> 01:11:13,737
Yes. Perhaps if the boy
were French...

809
01:11:15,546 --> 01:11:17,912
We are doing everything possible.

810
01:11:17,981 --> 01:11:21,348
We have roadblocks everywhere.
Extra units have been called out.

811
01:11:22,085 --> 01:11:24,144
The proper thing
for you to do is to go home...

812
01:11:24,221 --> 01:11:26,985
and leave this
to the professionals, please.

813
01:11:27,057 --> 01:11:30,515
- But, Inspector...
- Don't worry your pretty little head.

814
01:11:30,594 --> 01:11:34,030
Mr. Ambassador,
we have this under control.

815
01:11:34,097 --> 01:11:37,828
This kind of thing happens all the time.
Children go to the circus.

816
01:11:37,901 --> 01:11:42,167
Their little eyes fill with big dreams
of the way life should be.

817
01:11:44,308 --> 01:11:45,935
What happened to the nun?

818
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:56,182
... down six percent due to a lack
of consumer purchasing.

819
01:11:56,253 --> 01:11:58,813
The search is on tonight
for two missing children...

820
01:11:58,889 --> 01:12:01,756
who disappeared from the Cirque Pandora
carnival late this afternoon.

821
01:12:01,825 --> 01:12:05,090
French police are looking for the son
of the Spanish ambassador to France...

822
01:12:05,162 --> 01:12:06,629
and a local schoolgirl.

823
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:11,100
What it we never get out of here,
never go home?

824
01:12:11,168 --> 01:12:14,035
Your family will pay the ransom.

825
01:12:14,104 --> 01:12:16,971
So will yours.

826
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,600
They can't.

827
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:22,736
- I don't have a family.
- What do you mean?

828
01:12:24,314 --> 01:12:28,011
They're gone.
They're in heaven.

829
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,381
I'm sorry.

830
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:36,084
It's all right.
It happened a long time ago.

831
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:44,228
My parents probably don't want me back.
I'm a lot of trouble, you know?

832
01:12:45,168 --> 01:12:49,662
You are a lot of trouble.
But you know, you have got charisma.

833
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,708
You think so?

834
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:57,409
I miss the girls
and Miss Clavel.

835
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,114
Don't worry, Madeline.

836
01:13:00,183 --> 01:13:02,413
I won't leave without you.
I promise.

837
01:13:02,486 --> 01:13:04,511
Thank you, Pepito.

838
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,957
There have been no signs
of the children.

839
01:13:10,027 --> 01:13:11,961
Foul play has not been ruled out.

840
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:14,361
Authorities are asking
for public cooperation...

841
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,365
in the departmental-wide canvass.

842
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,695
Now sport.

843
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:21,260
- How could she run away?
- Do you think she's okay out there?

844
01:13:21,338 --> 01:13:25,934
It's all my fault.
I should have never let her go.

845
01:13:26,009 --> 01:13:29,445
You did the right thing, Aggie.
I would have done it too.

846
01:13:31,315 --> 01:13:33,613
I miss Madeline so much.

847
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:48,230
So where is she? Hmm?

848
01:14:05,782 --> 01:14:07,079
Where's your brother?

849
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:09,084
I don't know.

850
01:14:11,355 --> 01:14:13,949
I can do anything.

851
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,073
Pepito, wake up!

852
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:45,286
They left us here with the knives
that they juggle at the circus.

853
01:14:47,324 --> 01:14:49,053
What idiots!

854
01:14:50,127 --> 01:14:52,254
On the count of three, okay?

855
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:00,401
Okay, go.

856
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,268
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

857
01:15:06,343 --> 01:15:08,072
Move it!

858
01:15:11,248 --> 01:15:14,911
- You're getting better.
- Move! Now!

859
01:15:14,985 --> 01:15:17,453
Hurry up. They're leaving.

860
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:20,081
But we're still trapped in here.

861
01:15:20,157 --> 01:15:22,489
Look! I've got it!

862
01:15:23,994 --> 01:15:25,120
So?

863
01:15:25,195 --> 01:15:28,926
So it's a motorcycle,
and you know how to drive one.

864
01:15:28,999 --> 01:15:31,024
This is our escape.

865
01:15:31,101 --> 01:15:36,038
But I drive a Vespa.
It doesn't even have gears.

866
01:15:37,107 --> 01:15:39,735
This is a motorcycle.
I can't drive something like this.

867
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:42,904
Yes, you can, Pepito.
You can do it.

868
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:47,746
Look, technically, I'm not even
allowed to leave my courtyard.

869
01:15:54,357 --> 01:15:55,824
Okay, give me your hairpin.

870
01:16:19,182 --> 01:16:21,616
Idiots! In the truck now!

871
01:16:21,685 --> 01:16:25,212
- Now! In the truck!
- Sorry about that.

872
01:16:27,023 --> 01:16:28,513
Hey, wait!

873
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,163
Yes! We did it!

874
01:16:39,236 --> 01:16:40,294
Yes!

875
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,007
Where are you, Thumbelina?

876
01:16:48,111 --> 01:16:49,510
Oh, no! Look!

877
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:52,445
There!

878
01:16:55,919 --> 01:16:59,446
- Wait! I'll drive!
- Get off!

879
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:15,595
Oh, I'm going to be sick!

880
01:17:15,672 --> 01:17:17,264
Come on, Pepito!

881
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:20,605
I'm going!
Hang on, Madeline!

882
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:02,646
- Faster!
- Hey, you wanna drive or what?

883
01:18:09,292 --> 01:18:10,657
Hey, who's that?

884
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:13,525
Oh, great! Miss Clavel!

885
01:18:13,597 --> 01:18:15,588
- Who's Miss Clavel?
- Oh, some nun.

886
01:18:15,665 --> 01:18:17,895
- A nun?
- A nun!

887
01:18:18,668 --> 01:18:21,068
Hold on, Genevieve.

888
01:18:43,827 --> 01:18:45,988
Don't kill the nun!

889
01:18:46,062 --> 01:18:48,758
Forget the nun!
Don't kill the idiots!

890
01:18:52,902 --> 01:18:54,529
Oh, no!

891
01:19:00,677 --> 01:19:02,110
Yeah!

892
01:19:02,178 --> 01:19:04,544
Yea, we did it!

893
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:06,639
Ha-ha! We got you!

894
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:10,477
Get 'em! Move, you idiot!

895
01:19:10,553 --> 01:19:13,954
Pierre! My name is Pierre!

896
01:19:14,024 --> 01:19:17,482
- Look! Look at them!
- Miss Clavel!

897
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:27,698
Hey, easy!
Are you all right?

898
01:20:06,643 --> 01:20:08,736
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Not now.

899
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:11,178
- Mom, I drove a real motorbike!
- You did?

900
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:17,381
- We'll never leave you again.
- Never again.

901
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:28,329
She's here!

902
01:20:28,398 --> 01:20:30,332
Madeline, you're back!

903
01:20:33,503 --> 01:20:35,733
- I missed you.
- I missed you more.

904
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:41,272
Great car.

905
01:20:41,344 --> 01:20:42,606
I thought you were dead.

906
01:20:45,415 --> 01:20:47,576
Oh, thanks, Vicki.

907
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,584
Oh, super.

908
01:20:51,154 --> 01:20:55,716
Tonight I'm going to make
a wonderful vegetarian dinner, okay?

909
01:20:55,792 --> 01:20:57,783
I want Chicken Helene.

910
01:20:57,861 --> 01:20:59,055
Oh, no.

911
01:21:13,309 --> 01:21:17,405
Lord Covington, please. We were
just about to have a celebration.

912
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,573
Well, yes, indeed.
Young ladies.

913
01:21:19,649 --> 01:21:23,585
The ambassador from Uzbekistan
has just agreed to buy the school.

914
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:25,587
What's Uzbekistan?

915
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:30,249
Very nice.
Just like in the pictures.

916
01:21:32,662 --> 01:21:36,655
Very shortly, the Uzbekistani flag
will be fluttering from the root.

917
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:42,504
I'm so sorry.

918
01:21:42,572 --> 01:21:46,303
The house has been used for the past
few decades as a school for girls.

919
01:21:46,376 --> 01:21:48,310
Yes, as you said.

920
01:21:48,378 --> 01:21:49,811
Oh, I'm so sorry.

921
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:55,546
Very nice portrait.

922
01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:57,779
Yes, it's of my late wife.

923
01:21:57,854 --> 01:22:00,982
It was painted shortly atter
we got back from Venice one year.

924
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:06,294
It's rather a good likeness.
I'm very fond of it.

925
01:22:07,397 --> 01:22:08,728
Marie Gilbert.

926
01:22:11,234 --> 01:22:14,465
- I know why you're doing this.
- What?

927
01:22:15,338 --> 01:22:17,806
It's because
you're all alone, isn't it?

928
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:22,635
Please, young lady,
please mind your own business.

929
01:22:22,712 --> 01:22:26,808
You must have loved her very much.
She was your whole family, wasn't she?

930
01:22:29,285 --> 01:22:33,381
I thought you were mean, Lord Covington,
but you're not. I understand now.

931
01:22:33,456 --> 01:22:38,189
Understand? How can you possibly
understand? You're only a child.

932
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:43,597
You see, my wife, Marie and l...

933
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:48,164
This is totally inappropriate.

934
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:50,331
Please go away.

935
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:53,375
I lost my family too,
a long time ago.

936
01:22:53,443 --> 01:22:56,003
But they're not really gone,
are they?

937
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:58,776
She's not gone, is she?

938
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:01,373
- She's dead. She's gone.
- No, she's not.

939
01:23:01,451 --> 01:23:04,579
She's still with you,
and she's in the school too.

940
01:23:06,322 --> 01:23:09,086
Please, Lord Covington.
She wouldn't want you to sell it.

941
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:14,753
My love...

942
01:23:14,831 --> 01:23:18,790
no matter what happens, I'll make sure
that you and I will be together.

943
01:23:18,868 --> 01:23:19,800
No, Miss Clavel.

944
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:22,235
- Yes!
- No!

945
01:23:25,341 --> 01:23:27,639
The child's right.

946
01:23:32,115 --> 01:23:33,707
Yes, you're right.

947
01:23:36,519 --> 01:23:40,216
But the school's already sold.
There's nothing I can...

948
01:23:43,526 --> 01:23:45,994
Unless I might be allowed...

949
01:23:46,062 --> 01:23:47,461
Please, Mr. Ambassador.

950
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,228
I know the girl's school
may not mean much...

951
01:23:52,302 --> 01:23:54,293
to Uzbekistan or to you, sir...

952
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:56,429
I'm not the ambassador.

953
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:03,906
I am the ambassador.

954
01:24:06,215 --> 01:24:07,739
Oh!

955
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:14,055
You can keep your school.

956
01:25:11,214 --> 01:25:15,514
Girls! Stay together!

957
