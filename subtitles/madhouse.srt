and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,626
He's over there!

3
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,339
He's this way!

4
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,417
This way! This way!

5
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,223
Hurry up!

6
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,517
Hello? It's Clark Stevens
from Farley University.

7
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,993
Hello? I'm looking
for Dr. Franks.

8
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,354
Excuse me, do you know where
I can find Dr. Franks?

9
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,938
It doesn't like it
when you say that!

10
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,607
- And it doesn't like you!
- Leave him alone.

11
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,945
Can't you tell he doesn't
like you touching him like that?

12
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,211
It doesn't like it
when you say that.

13
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:03,477
And it doesn't like you
either, Puddles!

14
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,985
It's too fucking bad!

15
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,456
That's enough, Puddles.
I'm Dr. Hendricks.

16
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,456
Clark Stevens.

17
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:12,625
Welcome to Cunningham Hall.

18
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,626
Thank you very much.

19
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,363
I hope you don't mind
I let myself in.

20
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,297
No, we've been expecting you.

21
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,634
Well, my train
ran a little late.

22
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,037
And it's hard to find a cab
to take you out here.

23
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,139
- Yet here you are.
- Yes, here I am.

24
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,443
We should probably begin with
a series of psychiatric tests...

25
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,747
to make sure we start with
a clean bill of mental health...

26
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:38,080
Followed by
a thorough physical.

27
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,587
- Betty.
- Mr. Franklin.

28
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:46,826
What did we talk about when we said
no more pretending we're a doctor?

29
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,928
- But, but I was...
- I know, Mr. Franklin.

30
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,634
Why don't you go back in the rec
room and make yourself at home?

31
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:58,070
Nurse Hendricks is going
to serve Pudding Pops.

32
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,851
- Won't that be nice?
- Very nice.

33
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:03,632
- Good boy!
- It was nice to meet you.

34
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,013
- Hi. I'm Betty Donner.
- Clark Stevens.

35
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,347
I'm the Administration
Coordinator.

36
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,386
I'm sorry I missed you up front.
I just stepped away for a moment.

37
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:17,522
Don't worry about it.
I'm glad to finally meet you.

38
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:22,395
Same here. We are so excited about
your coming in to lend us a hand.

39
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,964
I'm excited about
getting to work.

40
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,761
Wonderful.
Wonderful.

41
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:33,005
Perfect. I'll have your badge
ready for you in a few days.

42
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,909
I need you
to fill out these forms...

43
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,643
so you get school credit.

44
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,636
Blue card on the bottom's
for emergency information.

45
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,550
Your keys to the kingdom.

46
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,086
- Thank you.
- And your walkie-talkie.

47
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,954
That's how
we communicate here.

48
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,857
You'll stay in a cottage on
the south side of the building.

49
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,027
Well, there's only
one thing left.

50
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,231
- What's that?
- To meet the big cheese.

51
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,713
Dr. Franks.

52
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:02,194
Very good.

53
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,379
Hello, Betty.

54
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,216
I take it this place has
been around for a while.

55
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,751
Since 1918.

56
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:24,156
You should have seen the shape it
was before we spruced it all up.

57
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,392
It took our patient
clean-up committee...

58
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,628
a year and a half
to get it to this point.

59
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,130
They've done
such a marvelous job.

60
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,765
Absolutely.
No, I'm sure.

61
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:38,837
It's just...
It seems a little rundown.

62
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,274
Not particularly conducive
to rehabilitation.

63
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:49,015
For some of the patients,
that will never happen.

64
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,582
- Get me out of here.
- Carl!

65
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,419
I shouldn't be here!
No one should.

66
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,787
- Carl...
- It's okay.

67
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,325
They don't let you go home even
when they know you're better.

68
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,126
Why do you say that?

69
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,796
Because the people
running this place...

70
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,094
are really the crazy ones.

71
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,098
Guilty as charged.
Now run along. Go on, scoot!

72
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,809
Have a seat.

73
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,414
The doctor will be
with you momentarily.

74
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,153
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much, Betty.

75
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,202
'Einstein also believed...

76
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,803
some chronic
schizophrenics were...

77
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,706
misdiagnosed due to possible
psychokinetic conditions...

78
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:26,608
such as their ability to see
paranormal activities.'

79
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,787
Not a pleasant way to receive
mental health treatment.

80
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,863
I received your records
from the university.

81
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,564
4.0 average. My, my.

82
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:51,203
You have the potential to follow
in your grandfather's footsteps.

83
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,603
Thank you.
I hope so.

84
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,276
My internship here is all
I need to get my degree.

85
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,146
- Then what?
- Well...

86
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,316
to take residence in a mental
health facility as a counselor.

87
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,084
That goes without saying.

88
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,355
What's going on with these?
Put them in a cup, Polly.

89
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,456
Sorry, Dr. Franks.

90
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,526
My minor, sir,
is in administrations.

91
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,196
I'd love to work in a place
like Cunningham Hall.

92
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,031
Maybe design
an updated curriculum.

93
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:24,136
I researched the building
and its operating procedures.

94
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,603
I made notes.

95
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,174
Little changes
we might implement...

96
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,892
during my stay.

97
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,609
Mr. Stevens...

98
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,137
I hope you understand what
you've gotten yourself into here.

99
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,950
- I'm sorry?
- This isn't a summer camp.

100
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:43,489
We have neither funding nor time for
anything but patient maintenance.

101
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,176
I absolutely understand that
has to be the priority, but...

102
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:50,863
You want to empty bedpans
to make your grades better...

103
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,330
great.

104
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,432
But you're not in class...

105
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,802
reading about life
in a mental institute.

106
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,436
You've arrived.

107
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,240
I didn't mean any disrespect.
I just thought...

108
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,042
Let me be blunt.
You're not here to think.

109
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:08,747
If you want to be on my staff, I
want you to focus on the objective.

110
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:12,740
- That is?
- Maintenance of the mentally ill.

111
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,391
Make no mistake.
There are serious reasons why...

112
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,155
a person would be
locked up in here.

113
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:27,233
Where is this wonder boy
I have heard so much about?

114
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,833
Dr. Morton, Dr. Douglas.

115
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,637
- Clark Stevens.
- Nice to meet you.

116
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:34,440
It is you.
I'd recognize you anywhere.

117
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,274
I met your grandfather...

118
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:40,746
at the Chicago Conference of
Mental Health Sciences in '75.

119
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,047
He and I
went on such a bender...

120
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,953
I was discussing our operating
procedures with Mr. Stevens.

121
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,114
We've come
to an understanding.

122
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,528
Introduce him to Sara, then she
can give him the grand tour.

123
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,897
I like to give my favorites
a little extra.

124
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,034
You never know when
you might need a little favor.

125
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,768
Noted.

126
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,638
So you survived
the Franks interview.

127
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,542
- Yes. Just barely.
- Some say it's the worst...

128
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,245
shock treatment
the hospital offers.

129
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,779
I can't argue with that.

130
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,652
He's kind of a shark, the
bottom line's if you work hard...

131
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,854
he'll hire you full-time.

132
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,055
That's what he did with me.

133
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,293
I would just ideally love
to help change this place.

134
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,284
Improve it a bit.

135
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,130
That's what we all say...

136
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,968
until the third time
you're stabbed with a pencil.

137
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,435
Point taken.

138
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,704
When did you
start working here?

139
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,771
Last year.

140
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,974
I served the same
internship you did.

141
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,306
So you graduated last year?

142
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,845
You're a year older than me.

143
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,917
Which means you have
to do everything I say.

144
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,020
Come on. I'll be your
tour guide today.

145
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,876
This is B ward.

146
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,095
Group therapy's in there.

147
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:23,314
Showers, med station.

148
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,251
We keep it locked
for obvious reasons.

149
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,078
Also we keep some low
security risk patients here.

150
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,023
Ladies' rooms.

151
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,832
Your duties will range
from monitoring patients...

152
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,167
sitting on
group therapy sessions...

153
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,328
to assisting staff.

154
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,774
Speaking of which, brace
yourself. Nurse Hendricks.

155
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,241
Sara.

156
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:55,080
- You must be Clark.
- Yes, indeed. Nice to meet you.

157
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,883
- He's the new intern.
- Of course he is.

158
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,817
I'm Anabelle Hendricks,
head nurse.

159
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,971
- Pleasure.
- I wondered where you went to.

160
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:06,350
Seems to be a regular
occurrence lately.

161
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:09,727
I'm sorry, I haven't
been feeling well.

162
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:15,234
You'll assist Nurse Hendricks
as well as other staff.

163
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,101
- I look forward to it.
- So do I.

164
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,905
It will be nice to have
a little muscle here.

165
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,708
May I speak with
you in the office, please?

166
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,005
Sure.

167
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,057
He's been up there...

168
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,031
for months.

169
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,125
Who has?

170
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,343
- We need to change the prescription.
- I signed off on everything.

171
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,747
You need to be there
at precisely...

172
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,647
Sara?
Do you understand?

173
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,349
- Ready for more?
- Sure.

174
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,789
- Enjoy your stay here, Clark.
- Thank you very much.

175
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,656
What a bitch. Come on.

176
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,960
That's Crystal.

177
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,361
She's our resident
nymphomaniac.

178
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,934
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

179
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,502
To the unpleasant part
of this job.

180
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:01,070
Where we keep
high-risk patients.

181
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,710
You won't often be asked
to come down here.

182
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,712
Trust me, it's a good thing.

183
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,236
What is it?

184
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,252
Housing for potential
murderers, lunatics...

185
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:16,187
Your everyday
garden-variety maniacs.

186
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,492
- That sounds interesting.
- Look...

187
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,690
this is where they tuck away
people everyone wants to forget.

188
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,858
The ones
you never hear about.

189
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,105
Unless they have the chance to
act on their natural instinct.

190
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,672
Which is?

191
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,039
To rip you limb from limb.

192
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,610
Welcome to the madhouse.

193
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,548
After you.

194
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,676
Wallace.

195
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,396
Hey, sugar. They been
asking for you all day.

196
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:17,115
This is Clark. He'll be
with us for a while.

197
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,514
My condolences.

198
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:19,912
Here you go.

199
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,186
He's going to need
your belt.

200
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,559
Here's the drill. Stay behind
the yellow line at all times.

201
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,126
If you need help...

202
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,696
push the alarm
at the end of the hall.

203
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,230
I need your pen...

204
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,563
and any other sharp
objects on you.

205
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,299
They can't get out,
can they?

206
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,931
That's what they
keep telling me.

207
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,671
Nice to meet you.

208
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,649
- Ready for this?
- Sure.

209
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,983
I've volunteered in a
couple of hospitals before.

210
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,415
I can't believe they keep
patients down here.

211
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,758
Run into that on your
volunteer work?

212
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,453
Let me out.

213
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:40,558
I have something for you.

214
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,559
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

215
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,246
You are not going to
leave me down here!

216
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:57,841
Get back here
and hook a sister up!

217
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,181
Severe obsessive-compulsive
disorder.

218
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:03,379
She has to do everything
in sets of nine.

219
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,824
Including the doses
of strychnine...

220
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,985
she gave
her preschool class.

221
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,962
- Paranoid?
- Homicidal.

222
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,648
Sara! Sara!

223
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,255
- Sara, help!
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

224
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,189
Drake!
Royce is at it again.

225
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,122
Can you bring
his meds down?

226
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,290
Royce, calm down! It will be fine.
Drake's on his way with your meds.

227
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,136
God! Sara!

228
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,539
Let go! Let go!

229
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,938
Drake!

230
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,222
It's all right.
He didn't hurt me!

231
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,883
Drake!

232
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,160
He didn't hurt us.

233
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,999
Let's hope he gets
it right next time.

234
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,700
Here, big guy.

235
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,169
Thanks, kid.
I owe you one.

236
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,544
Let's get out of here.

237
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,495
Betty, this is Wallace.
I'm heading home.

238
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,495
Drake is here.

239
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:55,500
Dottie's got a roast waiting
that has my name all over it.

240
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:59,504
That's a big 10-4, Wallace.
You have a nice evening. Over.

241
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,995
10-4, Betty. You, too.
Over and out.

242
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,441
Hello?

243
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,395
Hey, I saw you.

244
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,104
Why don't you come out
and introduce yourself?

245
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,383
Drake,
are you still here?

246
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,751
I could use help. I have
a situation in the rec room.

247
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,801
Once again, Alice...

248
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:08,807
are you going to do what your
caretaker is requesting of you?

249
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:09,874
You're hurting my arm!

250
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,612
I'm trying to make sure
you don't hurt yourself.

251
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,947
Take your pills
if you want to get better.

252
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,048
Doesn't that make sense,
sweetheart?

253
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,418
I'm going to ask that
you take your medication...

254
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,116
or I'm afraid I'll have to
resort to disciplinary measures.

255
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,119
He'll watch
when you are sleeping.

256
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:35,032
Do we have an understanding?

257
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,004
Do you think I enjoy
hurting you like this?

258
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,872
That medicine
don't work on me!

259
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,106
Alice!

260
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,676
- Stop!
- Bite your tongue, Carl!

261
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,610
You're hurting her!

262
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,512
Get away from me,
you faggot!

263
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,610
- It's okay.
- Drake!

264
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,679
You get back!

265
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,843
It's late for you,
isn't it?

266
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:08,758
It wants me
to go to sleep now.

267
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,866
Let's go.

268
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,248
Kid!

269
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,864
Unbelievable.

270
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,704
I saw you come down here.
Why don't you come out?

271
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,413
Hey, kid, come on.

272
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,658
This isn't a good place to be.
You could get...

273
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,148
hurt.

274
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,140
Safety alarm
at the end of the hall.

275
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,090
- Jesus!
- There's no one in there.

276
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,071
Dr. Morton, how long
have you worked here?

277
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,173
I've worked here
for 27 years.

278
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,743
- That's a long time.
- You have no idea.

279
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,312
That were you doing
down there after hours?

280
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,950
I followed the little boy.
That kid running around.

281
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,784
He broke into my room.

282
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,776
I chased him to see
who he was.

283
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,258
It's strange that he runs
around here at night.

284
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,661
I guess the whole place
is a little strange

285
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,789
- Occupational hazard.
- I guess so.

286
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,370
That noise I keep hearing,
what is that?

287
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,673
It sounds like it comes
from the basement.

288
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,309
I figured it was
the water pipes?

289
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,708
Maybe.

290
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:44,982
Well, what is it?

291
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,553
It's an old building.
It can be a variety of things.

292
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,854
- But...
- Buildings are like people.

293
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,492
They remember everything that
happened to them through time.

294
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,927
Sometimes...

295
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,714
they don't like
what they remember.

296
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:03,043
- What do you mean?
- A while back...

297
00:30:03,044 --> 00:30:06,370
we had a patient
down in Cell 44.

298
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:13,044
He was the saddest sickest
subject I've ever come across.

299
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,946
One night he...

300
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,847
dug himself out...

301
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,852
but he got turned around
and couldn't find his way.

302
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,553
What happened?

303
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,490
He jumped out
a third-story window.

304
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,980
Did he die?

305
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,726
Some say he died when
he hit the ground.

306
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:34,255
Some say they caught him and
locked him back up. But I...

307
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,259
I believe
he's still here...

308
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,667
trying to dig his
way out and go home.

309
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,836
You believe that?

310
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,075
Either that or he came back
to run this place.

311
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,252
Mr. Stevens...

312
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,654
I have a wet cleanup in
the TV room.

313
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:01,826
If you're not too busy,
perhaps you could mop it up?

314
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:03,487
Sure.

315
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,467
Sneaking around...

316
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,102
leaving maximum
security open.

317
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,789
You've had quite
a first night, Mr. Stevens.

318
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,474
- I wasn't sneaking around.
- Speak to me.

319
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:21,813
Nurse Hendricks called for help
over the radio and I came.

320
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:23,847
And?

321
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:28,953
And I got to the rec room and
realized she didn't need help...

322
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:31,689
being that she was using
a taser on a patient.

323
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,425
Some patients have
to be constantly reminded...

324
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,827
who has the upper hand.

325
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:41,933
Refusing to take medication
doesn't warrant an electrical burn.

326
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,800
- Stevens...
- This place is a mess.

327
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,837
It's dirty, it's unsafe,
it's understaffed.

328
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:50,975
Are you aware there are children
running around here at night?

329
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:54,011
No one gets in or out
without my authorization.

330
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,215
What about the patient that
escaped from the basement?

331
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,775
Dr. Morton told me about...

332
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,952
a patient who escaped.

333
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,825
Dr. Morton doesn't know
what he's talking about.

334
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,760
Look, let's start over again,
all right?

335
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,633
While it's no secret this
place could use fixing up...

336
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:19,701
most of the patients
housed here are content.

337
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:23,768
You know why? They have
no place else to go.

338
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,512
I'll make you a deal.

339
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,647
Stick to the rules,
mind your own business.

340
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,618
I'll consider some of the
suggestions you put together.

341
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,677
Are we in agreement,
Mr. Stevens?

342
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,220
Fine.

343
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,593
Well, hello there, busy bee.

344
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,083
Good morning.

345
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,670
What are you trying
to pull here?

346
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,406
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

347
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,408
Albert, things
will change here...

348
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,410
or I'm placing
a call to the board.

349
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,605
I know what you are up to.

350
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,589
Hey, new guy!

351
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,326
Hey there.
What are you doing?

352
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,494
What are you doing?

353
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,396
I'm on my way back
to my room.

354
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:23,167
Do you want to sit in on an
obsessive-compulsive group...

355
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,671
at 3:30?
It's my own little session.

356
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,771
It sounds great, really...

357
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,435
But, I don't want to get into
any more hot water.

358
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,912
- Why, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

359
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,906
I was in Frank's office
and I saw something weird.

360
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,154
He has a lot
of weird books.

361
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,623
One, in particular
on his desk...

362
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,149
he put it away
when he realized I saw it.

363
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:55,865
Are you sure you're not a private
detective disguised as an intern?

364
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,767
- I'm a dork?
- You're a dork.

365
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,939
The guy reads weird books.

366
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,810
Maybe he's learning about
his bedside manner.

367
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:09,268
Sara, to the nurses' station,
please.

368
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,649
Copy.

369
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,448
- Got to go.
- Good luck.

370
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,965
Good night,
Nurse Hendricks.

371
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,500
- Everyone in bed?
- All tucked in.

372
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:47,951
I'm almost done.

373
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,614
If you don't need anything
I'll go lay down.

374
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,122
I'll check it out.

375
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,129
Is there something
we can help you with?

376
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,616
It's bedtime!

377
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:40,459
I don't have time for foolishness!
Come out and show yourself.

378
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:45,272
I don't have time to waste
and I don't want to hurt you.

379
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,539
Who are you?

380
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,019
You are only
hurting yourself.

381
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,837
Well...

382
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,106
I suppose if you aren't
going to come out...

383
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,140
you'll have to make yourself
cozy until Drake arrives.

384
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:22,173
He'll find a way to convince
you to go back to your room.

385
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,002
Stop!

386
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,373
Why are you doing this?

387
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,080
Stop!

388
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,764
I know you're all devastated
by what happened.

389
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,569
I want to know which patient did
this and I want to know by tonight.

390
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,489
Betty will assign
each of you a section.

391
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,407
I want you to
interview the residents.

392
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,044
They trust you. I want you
to use that trust.

393
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:06,033
Keep the authorities out, or the
patients will give you nothing.

394
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:11,022
Then we will thoroughly review
the security and safety protocol.

395
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:13,441
- Let's get going.
- Roger that.

396
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:16,269
I can't believe
this happened.

397
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,096
I worked with her
for 25 years.

398
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:21,465
She was such a nice lady.

399
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,099
Dr. Morton?

400
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,836
Get Dr. Shores,
take the West Wing.

401
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,337
Everything's okay.

402
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,796
Dr. Douglas said she was
with you before it happened.

403
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:35,279
- Did you see anyone?
- We heard someone in the hall...

404
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,533
and she went
to check it out.

405
00:38:38,534 --> 00:38:41,277
Then I heard loud music
and I...

406
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,020
They think
a patient did it?

407
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,888
Clark! You and Drake
are in the basement.

408
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,984
Don't be afraid, Clarkie.
I'll protect you.

409
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,495
All right.
I have to go.

410
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,296
Yeah, sure.

411
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:02,439
- We didn't see...
- Anything.

412
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,042
- We were sleeping.
- Our door is locked.

413
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:08,977
Tight as a drum.
Are you dating Sara?

414
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:12,912
If you remember anything,
let me know.

415
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,486
I'll kill you, you freak!

416
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,757
I'll make sure you rot there
the rest of your life!

417
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,157
What's wrong?

418
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,252
I'll teach this freak
to show respect.

419
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,397
Take a break.

420
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,889
I'm almost done here.
I'll be out in a minute.

421
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:36,069
Why don't you come inside and
I'll make us a Remy Martins?

422
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,825
It's the ones
who protest too much...

423
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:42,310
that end up wearing
their wives' panties!

424
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,114
Why won't you
talk to me?

425
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,827
It might help you
sort things out.

426
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,973
How does it feel to be
convinced something is there...

427
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,407
when logic tells you
it's not?

428
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,787
I thought
I was hearing things.

429
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,279
Now you know what
madness feels like.

430
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,761
That's a feeling
you'll never forget.

431
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,929
Why are you sitting
in the dark?

432
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,525
lllumination only reminds me
of what I've become.

433
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,735
What's your name?

434
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,170
That's a subjective question.

435
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,074
There was a problem here
last night.

436
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,977
So we're taking time
with each resident...

437
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,846
asking them if they heard
or saw anything unusual.

438
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,836
Funny you'd ask a madman...

439
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:31,322
if he's seen
anything unusual.

440
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,051
All right, thank you.

441
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,889
Pretty strange place,
this Cunningham Hall.

442
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,936
- How so?
- Bad things going down here.

443
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,071
But you know that.

444
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,873
What kind of bad things?

445
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:54,061
Take that sick individual
lurking around, for instance.

446
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:58,249
Someone who's comforted
by the warmth of fresh blood.

447
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,883
Who do you think it is?

448
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,682
You're a smart boy,
you'll figure it out.

449
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,823
Is it you?

450
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:11,228
The top of the food chain would be
a good place to start looking.

451
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,492
Are you speaking
of Dr. Franks?

452
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,246
They're cell numbers
on a prescription to me.

453
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,967
Go to Betty or Wallace to find
out who the hell they are.

454
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:37,687
They wouldn't know their
own names if you asked them.

455
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,525
Can you tell me what the patient
in cell 44 was diagnosed with?

456
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:43,726
I just keep them doped up.

457
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,545
Do you know
what medication he's on?

458
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:47,363
You sure have
a lot of questions.

459
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:50,751
Risperdex. That's what
they're all on down there.

460
00:42:50,752 --> 00:42:54,138
- An antidepressant.
- Have you seen the place?

461
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:55,867
Thank you, Grace.

462
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,809
You're breaking
rule number one...

463
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,578
about working
in a place like this.

464
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,911
What's that?

465
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,540
Taking what
the patients say seriously.

466
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:09,619
I'm not.
Believe me, I'm not.

467
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,389
I did hear Hendricks
and Franks arguing...

468
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,653
the night she got killed.

469
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:19,861
You have to understand these
patients are totally delusional.

470
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:24,030
They'll tell you things they
actually believe to be true.

471
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,405
But hardcore schizophrenics in
particular can't be trusted.

472
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:33,310
Take what they say
with a grain of salt.

473
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,777
I understand that.

474
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:40,579
It just seemed weird.
He was being cryptic.

475
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,386
They're paranoid.

476
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:48,592
They have it out for Franks because
he's keeping them locked in here.

477
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:52,162
You're reading too much
into this conversation.

478
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:55,298
You can never trust
a schizo.

479
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,001
Why are all the patients
in the basement...

480
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,601
on the same medication?

481
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:03,266
Because I'm sure they're keeping
them seriously tranquilized.

482
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,997
I used to love to play
outside this time of day.

483
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,898
Me and my friends.

484
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,015
We played kick-the-can...

485
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:33,131
sometimes dodge ball.

486
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,740
I was good at that.

487
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,232
Too afraid of getting hit
by the ball, I guess.

488
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,550
Then one day
things started to go bad.

489
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:47,717
How so?

490
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,686
I started seeing stuff.

491
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,719
Stuff before it happened.

492
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:57,193
One day my parents dropped me off
here to have some tests run.

493
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,365
And they never came back.

494
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,435
That's a rough thing
to carry with you.

495
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:10,931
You can try to steer your life
in the direction you want, but...

496
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:16,113
everything happens
as it's meant to be.

497
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:17,580
Maybe so.

498
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:25,718
I think you're not meant
to be here anymore.

499
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,392
You're right.

500
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,844
But the day I leave here...

501
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:37,192
will be the day
that I'm dead.

502
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:43,035
That's one of the bad things about
knowing stuff before it happens.

503
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,506
My little problem...

504
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,614
stems from the fact...

505
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:55,016
I was never allowed to get
in touch with my inner child.

506
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,488
I'm a vulnerable child...

507
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,105
trapped inside
an adult's body.

508
00:46:01,106 --> 00:46:03,722
And wearing
an adult diaper.

509
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,831
- Up yours, Jimmy!
- Okay, calm down.

510
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:10,901
Look, we're all
grieving right now.

511
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,165
Some of us feel vulnerable...

512
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,323
or depressed.

513
00:46:16,324 --> 00:46:18,374
Or scared.

514
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,246
That's right, Alice.
What makes you feel scared?

515
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:25,272
It won't stop scaring me.

516
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,518
What won't?

517
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:32,089
I try to close my eyes,
make it go away.

518
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,658
It's always right there,
watching me.

519
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,526
What is this 'it' that
you're referring to?

520
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,030
The ghost.

521
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,433
What ghost?

522
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,458
The one that runs through
the house at night.

523
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:54,378
It's always watching me
through the windows.

524
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,539
What does it want from you?

525
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:01,817
To make sure that I never
forget what madness feels like.

526
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,871
It's Betty.
Did I awake you?

527
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,607
Not at all.
I was just getting up.

528
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:01,344
Great. I wanted you to know
your badge is ready.

529
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,581
Dr. Franks wants to know if
you had anything to report...

530
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,349
from yesterday's interviews.

531
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:09,953
I've still got one more patient
I'd love to talk to down there...

532
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:14,657
but it seems like they
were all in their cells.

533
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:18,662
Drake checked the locks and it
didn't appear they could get out.

534
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:21,899
Just keep me posted.
I've got to type up...

535
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,135
the findings and give
them to the investigator.

536
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,365
Okay. Fantastic.

537
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,207
So nice of you to come down.

538
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,878
We seldom get visitors down
here in our little pit of despair.

539
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,781
Why did you stop talking to me
last time I was down here?

540
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:39,874
I'd run out of things to say.

541
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,322
Why don't you come into
the light where I can see you?

542
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,924
Come on,
we're friends by now.

543
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:52,963
Let's just say I suffered a
slight disfigurement as a child.

544
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:56,233
Since then, I choose
to live in the shadows.

545
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:57,825
All right, then.

546
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,730
Can you get out of this cell?

547
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,242
Only if someone lets me.

548
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,979
No more talking in circles.
Answer the question.

549
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,317
Are you wondering if that little
boy you keep seeing...

550
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:16,987
is somehow getting
the keys and letting me out?

551
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:18,921
What little boy?

552
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:21,891
Now who's talking in circles?

553
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,191
Clark, I've got Sara on
line one out here.

554
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:28,697
I'll be right up.

555
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,337
We'll continue
this conversation later?

556
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,328
You can call me Ben.

557
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,052
We have
to stop meeting like this.

558
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:50,883
What will the patients say?

559
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,989
I think it's
a little late for that.

560
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,966
So, did you finish up
your interviews?

561
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:05,769
Basically.
What are you taking?

562
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,104
Oh, I have a cold.

563
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,674
I interviewed all the patients
that I was assigned to.

564
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:13,843
- Their stories were out there.
- Mine too.

565
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:18,448
Mrs. Idelson told me that the guy
from 'Wheel of Fortune' did it.

566
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,245
That's possible.

567
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,187
I had one guy,
he's interesting...

568
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,355
but I don't think
he knows anything.

569
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,553
Sic Franks on him.
Let the cops do the rest.

570
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,490
Hang on, I forgot a fork.

571
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,137
What are you doing?

572
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,613
I'm sorry. They were
sticking out of your purse.

573
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,487
Some cold, huh?

574
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,956
Why you taking Risperdex?

575
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,792
Here goes.

576
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:12,635
When I was a little girl
I had problems focusing...

577
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:18,006
and I was later diagnosed with
really minor schizophrenia.

578
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,595
But I got put on Risperdex
and it leveled me out.

579
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:25,840
I haven't really had any
symptoms since I was a kid.

580
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:29,084
Is that how you got
interested in mental health?

581
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,794
Still want to be my friend?

582
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,022
Sure.

583
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,032
Crazy chicks are wild.

584
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,967
- You jerk.
- I'm kidding.

585
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,040
You're all right now?

586
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:52,575
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

587
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:56,307
- Look, don't tell anyone.
- I won't.

588
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,051
- Those pills are red.
- So?

589
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:05,078
The Risperdex Grace showed me,
the pills were blue.

590
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:10,885
I'm sure a bunch of psychos are
on a much stronger dose than I am.

591
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:24,339
This is the only way out, Sara!
Carl finally got to go home.

592
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:29,880
Please go to your rooms!

593
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:30,913
Ghosts.

594
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:34,680
Would somebody get
Dr. Franks on the radio!

595
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,690
- What happened?
- I was bringing in the games.

596
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,729
We were going to play Chutes
'n' Ladders, then this.

597
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,497
Maybe he hated
Chutes 'n' Ladders.

598
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,668
Did you see him talking
to anyone before he came in?

599
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,303
He went out
to get his medication.

600
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:58,070
- What was he given?
- An antidepressant?

601
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,513
- Grace! Was Carl just here?
- Half hour ago.

602
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,083
- Did you see him talking to anybody?
- Other than himself? No.

603
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,486
- What did you give him?
- What I always do.

604
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:11,054
Are we starting with Q&A again?

605
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,521
Because I don't have time.

606
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,441
Grace, I'm sorry,
what did you give him?

607
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,361
I gave him his usual dose
of Happy Tabs.

608
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,385
Thank you.

609
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,374
- Ben!
- I haven't gone anywhere.

610
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,728
You said something about
the medication they gave you.

611
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:39,082
- Does it help?
- I wouldn't know. I don't take it.

612
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:41,985
But I do have
a nice mosaic on the wall...

613
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:44,404
I've done with
my unused pills.

614
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:46,682
But, Ben,
why don't you take it?

615
00:53:46,683 --> 00:53:48,959
They wouldn't help me
if I did.

616
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,292
Why not?

617
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:53,029
A hospital
is a place of business.

618
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,164
When people get better...

619
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:59,185
there are less bodies in bed.
Doesn't that make sense?

620
00:53:59,186 --> 00:54:03,206
They give patients weak
medication to keep them sick?

621
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:04,640
Look around you.

622
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,836
The loonies here
only seem to get worse.

623
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,663
Take your friend Carl,
for instance.

624
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,791
He took his meds,
like a good boy.

625
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,689
And look what happened
to him.

626
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,585
How do you know about Carl?

627
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,953
Did I say something
happened to him?

628
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,530
I can't believe
you talked me into this.

629
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,991
I need to check out the med
station. I'll be out in 3 minutes.

630
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,329
Here they are!

631
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,273
Hurry.
Let's get out of here.

632
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,685
Why are we doing this?

633
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,122
I'll send the pills to a friend
who works at the university hospital.

634
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:29,853
I figured whoever's doing this
is on the wrong medication.

635
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:34,330
Look, Carl was ready
to go home.

636
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,133
According to Grace, he was on
a huge dose of tranquilizers.

637
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:39,069
He shouldn't have been
able to get out of bed...

638
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,969
much less hang himself.

639
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,706
What?

640
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,974
You're cute
when you're sleuthing.

641
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:52,574
Good night.

642
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,115
Good night.

643
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,908
Sara?

644
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,778
There is no place like home.

645
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,736
If Franks finds out we're in
his office, we're screwed.

646
00:57:08,737 --> 00:57:11,718
It was a little boy. I've been
seeing him since I got here.

647
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,432
At first I thought it was one
of the gardener's kids.

648
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:18,060
- What? You're sure he isn't?
- No way.

649
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,527
Look...

650
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,907
I know this sounds strange.

651
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,061
But I think this place
actually might be haunted.

652
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:30,889
I wouldn't believe it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

653
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,716
But I think Alice saw
something, and Franks, too.

654
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:37,447
Why else would
he have these books?

655
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:40,914
What?

656
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,831
It's just between your theories
on the medication, and Franks.

657
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:49,565
Now you're seeing ghosts?

658
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,634
Maybe your surroundings
are affecting you.

659
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,136
I'm not crazy, Sara.

660
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:58,540
He was right outside my window.
He looked right at me.

661
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,668
- Believe me.
- Okay, okay, I do.

662
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,953
Where do they keep
the patient records?

663
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,887
The nurses' station.

664
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,292
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me!

665
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:18,327
I didn't kill that bitch!

666
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,596
There's something you
ought to understand.

667
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,133
Nothing goes on here that
I don't know or hear about.

668
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:28,037
Then you know that
I'll be back for you.

669
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:29,873
And you, snitch!

670
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:31,707
You're next.

671
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,776
I'm going to skin you alive!

672
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:35,377
Nobody's safe here!

673
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,814
- Muzzle him.
- Nobody's safe!

674
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:39,848
That poor, troubled boy.

675
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,351
I heard he was raised
in a carnival.

676
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,549
Now we know where
the narcotics disappeared to.

677
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:49,758
What happened?

678
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:52,829
They're questioning him regarding
Nurse Hendricks' death.

679
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,097
Franks found her taser
in his things.

680
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,795
They also found out he had
relations with a patient.

681
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,486
Who are you?

682
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,471
<i>Clark, you're there?</i>

683
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,743
I'm sorry, yes, this is he.

684
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:15,979
<i>This is Tom, from the lab.</i>

685
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,346
Hi, Tom.

686
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,116
<i>There is no narcotics in
the drugs that you gave me.</i>

687
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,949
<i>- What?
- Just placebos.</i>

688
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:29,392
All right. Thank you
for looking into that.

689
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:31,257
You were right about
the medication.

690
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:36,065
The Risperdex they dispense
here is just a placebo.

691
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:39,669
Taking matters into our
own hands? Very aggressive.

692
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,272
I'll call the board first
thing Monday morning.

693
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:45,307
One patient is going
into psychoses...

694
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,477
and acting out because
he's not getting his meds.

695
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:53,499
I wouldn't tell anyone about
our discovery until then.

696
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:58,521
You wouldn't want Franks
to cover up their dirty work.

697
01:00:58,522 --> 01:01:00,352
They arrested Drake today...

698
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,355
and I don't think he did it.

699
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,598
I heard Hendricks arguing
with Franks the day she died.

700
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:11,633
I think he's connected
and she knew about it.

701
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:15,704
They say the obvious answer
usually is the answer.

702
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:20,267
It's in front of your eyes. You
have to be willing to see it.

703
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:26,049
How do you know about
everything going on here?

704
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,150
I'm smart.

705
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:32,255
Be honest with me. Can you
get out of this cell?

706
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:35,023
Let me go out, too!

707
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,093
Why do you get out
and I don't?

708
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:40,163
Only in my mind, Royce.

709
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:42,154
Only in my mind.

710
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,636
Tell me about the ghost
of the little boy.

711
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:49,539
He's showing up
everywhere now.

712
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,973
He must be fond of you.

713
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,310
You've got work to do.

714
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:59,680
You'd better get back upstairs
before you miss any more action.

715
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,555
Admittance, diagnosis,
release dates.

716
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,924
Here's everything you need.

717
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,585
This is amazing.

718
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,427
Great job.

719
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,055
Check this out.

720
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:18,000
Here are patients that
were rehabbed and released...

721
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,865
since Franks took over.

722
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,505
- How many?
- None.

723
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,669
None?
This is unbelievable.

724
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:32,941
This proves that he keeps patients
sick so they can't go home.

725
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:36,752
Ben London.

726
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:41,357
Cell 44, schizophrenic,
died in 1989?

727
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:43,848
- So?
- So he's not dead.

728
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,595
I talked to him this morning.

729
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,065
You're losing me.

730
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:54,196
Dr. Morton told me about a patient
who escaped from cell 44 years ago.

731
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,207
Maybe Ben was
the one who escaped.

732
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:01,077
And Franks tried
to cover it up by...

733
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:03,011
saying he died.

734
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:08,247
When they got around to catching
and bringing him back...

735
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:11,247
They never bothered to take
him off the deceased list.

736
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,652
Exactly.

737
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,030
What are you thinking?

738
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,298
I don't know.

739
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,862
You have to be thinking
about something.

740
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,040
You can tell me.
We're in this together.

741
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,450
Perfect.

742
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,190
Kitchen's closed!

743
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,671
Let me see...

744
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,312
peaches...

745
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,804
gravy, pudding...

746
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,518
meatloaf!

747
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,215
Just what the doctor ordered.

748
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:15,929
Pickles?

749
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:20,307
Pickles.

750
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:30,407
Ketchup.

751
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:36,459
Ketchup, ketchup, ketchup,
ketchup, ketchup.

752
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,653
Got you!

753
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,520
- Who are you?
- It's Clark.

754
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,087
What did you do to me?

755
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,924
Where am I?

756
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:24,704
What's happening to me?

757
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,781
It's okay.
Sara, look at me.

758
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,649
I work with you at
the hospital. Do you remember?

759
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,956
Look, I think you forgot
to take your medication.

760
01:07:43,957 --> 01:07:47,157
Take a couple of these
and it will be better.

761
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,222
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

762
01:08:02,223 --> 01:08:04,869
I just can't figure out...

763
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,151
what's real
and what's a dream.

764
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:10,311
Come on.

765
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:13,985
Come here.

766
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,589
All right.

767
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,832
...coming to the area
late today...

768
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:29,505
bringing along chances of
thunderstorm and low temperatures.

769
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:32,341
And now, for more informations
on our top story...

770
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:35,610
lets go back to Peter Garcia.

771
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:40,249
Sheriff Johnson warns
that the escaped suspect...

772
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,852
who was detained
on suspicion of murder...

773
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:45,453
should be considered
armed and dangerous.

774
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,640
He's known to go by
the alias of Drake Anderson.

775
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:51,652
Anderson is 5 foot 10,
has dark brown hair...

776
01:08:51,653 --> 01:08:54,276
and sports the tattoo
of a spider on his neck.

777
01:08:54,277 --> 01:08:56,898
Anyone with information
leading to his capture...

778
01:08:56,899 --> 01:09:00,027
should report it to
the Kirkside Sheriff's Department.

779
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,315
- What happened?
- Thank God you're okay.

780
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:16,017
- Someone killed Dr. Morton.
- What?

781
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,782
I'm scared. I don't know
who to trust anymore.

782
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,390
- Drake got out.
- What?

783
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:26,122
I heard it on the radio.
He escaped last night.

784
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,865
If it was him, then
he's probably long gone.

785
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:34,324
They searched this whole place
with a fine-tooth comb.

786
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,607
That investigator wants to
ask us a few questions.

787
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:41,040
Not now. I'm going
to talk to Franks.

788
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:43,473
- What?
- I'm going to talk to Franks!

789
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:50,685
Open the goddamn door!

790
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,849
Franks, I know you're
in there! Open the door!

791
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,673
Jesus!

792
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:14,742
- It isn't Drake.
- What are you talking about?

793
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:18,547
I asked the cops and they said
he was arrested 20 minutes ago.

794
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:21,016
- He stole a car in Dallas.
- I'm leaving.

795
01:10:21,017 --> 01:10:22,016
Wait, wait.

796
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,178
I don't know
what's going on here.

797
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,122
Come with me if you want,
but I'm not staying.

798
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:31,259
Okay. Okay.
Wait, I'll go.

799
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,862
Come with me to the office
and I'll grab a few things.

800
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:35,330
Come on.

801
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,532
I want to be
sure security...

802
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,100
can keep the patients
locked down.

803
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:42,867
They won't be safe here.
Nobody will be safe here.

804
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,642
I'll tell Betty we're going.

805
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:47,976
Fine.

806
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:52,380
But make it quick. I want to get
as far away as possible.

807
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:54,541
I will.

808
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,020
We'll be okay.

809
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,422
Nothing will happen with all
those cops hanging outside.

810
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,826
Here.

811
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:24,245
What if it's not a person
doing all this?

812
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:28,384
- What do you mean?
- What if it's like Morton said?

813
01:11:28,385 --> 01:11:31,020
What if something
happened in the building...

814
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:33,455
and it's never forgotten?

815
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,490
Clark...

816
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,192
it was a person.

817
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:41,463
And if it was a patient,
they're all in lockdown.

818
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,090
We're fine.

819
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:54,073
Now go back. I'll just
finish up around here.

820
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,892
<i>- It's right in front of your eyes.
- Clark, are you there?</i>

821
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,401
Right in front of your eyes.

822
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,346
I just can't figure out...

823
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:07,682
what's real
and what's a dream.

824
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,018
I was diagnosed
with schizophrenia.

825
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:11,452
Sara.

826
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,353
Thanks for your help,
Officer.

827
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,225
Also, I have
a list of patients.

828
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,320
I'll leave it in a red folder
in my outbox.

829
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,130
Not a problem.

830
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,329
You have my cell number.

831
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,732
Okay, all right, thank you.

832
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,596
Why did you drug me?

833
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,602
I just gave you a calmative.

834
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,574
You were acting
really strange.

835
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:07,608
It was you.

836
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:11,409
I should've figured it out
the other night when you had...

837
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,813
your relapse.

838
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,651
You're wrong.

839
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:21,385
Ben told me the answer was
right in front of my eyes.

840
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:26,627
- Who?
- Cell 44. Ben London.

841
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:31,211
He must have seen you the night
you killed Nurse Hendricks.

842
01:14:31,212 --> 01:14:35,794
That's why he told me the answer
was right in front of my eyes.

843
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,442
There's no one in cell 44.

844
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:46,312
- Don't lie to me.
- It's used for storage.

845
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:50,786
You were the one
who told me...

846
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:53,653
never to trust a schizo.

847
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,454
I can prove he's there.

848
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,529
There you are. I've been
looking for you.

849
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,568
Is something wrong?

850
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,647
Ben!

851
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:26,721
Ben! Ben, what's going on?

852
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:29,213
Why didn't you
tell me it was Sara?

853
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:35,910
I'm going to let you
out of here.

854
01:15:35,911 --> 01:15:38,259
So you can get
someplace safe.

855
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,550
But I want
to see your face.

856
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:45,065
I suppose
it's time to go home.

857
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,657
That kid I keep seeing
running around the halls?

858
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:06,617
It's a little strange that
he runs around here at night.

859
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:13,235
Maybe your surroundings
are starting to affect you.

860
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:15,396
I'm not crazy, Sara.

861
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,774
Now you know what
madness feels like.

862
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,377
That's a feeling
you'll never forget.

863
01:16:22,378 --> 01:16:23,708
Hey, good looking.

864
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,217
We've got work to do.

865
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,845
Boys are not toys, Les!

866
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:03,685
He was the sickest patient
that I ever come across.

867
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:06,288
There you are. I've been
looking for you.

868
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:08,950
You need to teach you
some respect!

869
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,231
What I'd love to do is change
this place for the better.

870
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,222
That's really why
I came here.

871
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,062
Betty, go to one.

872
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:27,642
Have my car sent around.

873
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,045
Where are my keys
to the medication?

874
01:17:30,046 --> 01:17:31,376
Never mind.

Clark, have you
lost your mind?

It's Ben!

and Hendricks...

Listen, I can help you.

It's too late
for that now!

893

Help!

894
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:04,959
Hello?
I'm at Cunningham Hall.

895
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,361
I'm in the basement.
There are cops outside.

896
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:11,564
Help me!

897
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,482
Come on, Sara.

898
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,419
You're as screwed up
as I am.

899
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,286
We belong together.

900
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:15,397
Come on, darling.
Get up out of the corner.

901
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:17,456
You're making me crazy.

902
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:24,901
- I didn't do anything.
- I know. It's just that...

903
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,242
I came back to this place...

904
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:31,178
to get rid of memories
I had here.

905
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,251
Unfortunately,
you're now one of them.

906
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:38,987
But I'm just like you.

907
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:41,488
I'm so sorry...

908
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,059
but I can't leave
any loose ends.

909
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:46,357
Ben, I can protect you.

910
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,229
I found your file.

911
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,102
I took it...

912
01:22:55,103 --> 01:22:57,571
and I'm keeping it
safe for you.

913
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:03,010
Where?

914
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,912
We can both go away.

915
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,221
They won't even know
you were here.

916

Clark.

917
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:56,220
Clark's not here,
anymore.

918
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,393
Clark doesn't even exist.
