Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,795
- Eleven days already.
- Hooray (!)

3
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:52,680
This is where the police officer rings
the bell and waits to get invited in, right?

4
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:01,358
All right, Barney.

5
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,882
What the hell is this?

6
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,838
Take it easy, Benesch.

7
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:18,324
Hell of a time in the morning
for a social call, Dan.

8
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,842
Now, don't complain, Barney.

9
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,999
We could've been here
half an hour ago.

10
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,196
Put your pants on,
we're taking you to Brooklyn.

11
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,676
- Brooklyn?
- Brooklyn.

12
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,202
I've been clean for two years.

13
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:36,326
- What do I know about Brooklyn?
- That's what they want to know. Move it.

14
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:43,119
- If I asked, you could show me a warrant?
- We left it downstairs with the doorman.

15
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,444
Watch out for my glasses.

16
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:55,846
- No gun?
- I gave them up.

17
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:57,963
What for? Lent?

18
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:00,561
Oh, you guys kill me.

19
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:06,038
I never thought you two
would try illegal entry.

20
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:07,959
Look who's talking.

21
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,965
- How old are you, honey?
- I am 22.

22
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:13,526
Twenty-two?

23
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,082
Move it, I wanna see the kids
before they go to school.

24
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:23,922
- You always were a family man, Rocky.
- That's right.

25
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:26,596
Rosita.

26
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,116
My jacket.

27
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:40,846
Not bad, eh, Danny Boy?
It's there for the asking.

28
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,156
Knock it off.

29
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,559
Drop the gun, Rocky.

30
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:51,366
You're out of your mind.
This is a routine check.

31
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:55,839
Cut the crap, Madigan!
Tell that wop cop it's now or never.

32
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:58,999
I said tell him to drop the gun!

33
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:07,837
Up with your hands, you bastards.

34
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,043
Get your hands up!

35
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,037
I'm never going in again.

36
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,675
Not with you, not with anybody.

37
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:19,439
All right, turn.

38
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:22,439
I said turn!

39
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:27,167
Your hands on his shoulders,
Danny Boy.

40
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,000
Get your hands on his shoulders!

41
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,122
Yours behind your head, Bonaro.

42
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:37,163
Right, now, walk slow.

43
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:54,760
No, you don't, Bonaro!
We're going upstairs to the roof.

44
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:06,436
Come on, move it, Madigan!

45
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,958
- You bum, you were looking at the broad!
- What the hell were you looking at?

46
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,756
He's headed for 99th Street.

47
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,046
Don't tell him I helped you.
He'll kill me!

48
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,436
<i>- Yeah?
- Muller?</i>

49
00:09:48,607 --> 00:09:51,963
<i>- Speaking. Is this you?
- Who do you think?</i>

50
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,324
<i>I'll see you at the same place,
only an hour later. Got that?</i>

51
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,365
<i>- Will you be able to?
- We'll both be there.</i>

52
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,315
<i>- You can count on it.
- We'll both be there. I'll meet your terms.</i>

53
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:06,526
<i>- And you'd better meet mine.
- Don't worry. Pleasure doing business...</i>

54
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,120
<i>Hello?</i>

55
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:09,436
<i>Hello?</i>

56
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:19,876
<i>- Yeah?
- Muller?</i>

57
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:23,403
<i>- Speaking. Is this you?
- Who do you think?</i>

58
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:27,606
<i>I'll see you at the same place,
only a hour later. Got that?</i>

59
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,519
<i>[Phone rings]</i>

60
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:32,565
<i>- Yes?
- Good morning, Commissioner.</i>

61
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:36,639
<i>- Morning, Charley.
- Bad news this morning, Tony.</i>

62
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,445
What do you mean, bad news?

63
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:43,123
A couple of the boys at the 23rd Precinct
stepped all over their nightsticks.

64
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:46,882
<i>Some loser named Barney Benesch
lifted their guns and took off.</i>

65
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:50,119
That's a hell of a thing.
Who were the officers involved?

66
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:53,279
First Grade Detectives
Daniel Madigan and Rocco Bonaro.

67
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:57,440
Damn that Madigan. He was bound
to get caught in a wringer sooner or later.

68
00:10:57,607 --> 00:11:01,282
Madigan's a good cop, Tony.
Doesn't always go by the book.

69
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:04,439
I like the book, Charley.
How did it happen?

70
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:08,077
I'll have the details for you
by the time you get downtown.

71
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,124
Right.

72
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:28,758
Darling? What are you doing up so early?

73
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:31,760
- I couldn't sleep.
- Why? Trouble?

74
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,440
All kinds.

75
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,558
<i>- Hello?
- Tom? Sorry to cut into your sleep.</i>

76
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:41,605
<i>- Can you pick me up right away?
- I'll be right there.</i>

77
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:42,856
Thank you.

78
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:45,558
What's wrong? Can you tell me?

79
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:48,036
When I know.

80
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,837
Would I be invading your privacy if I
asked you what you wanted for breakfast?

81
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,520
Just coffee and juice.

82
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:19,320
Morning, Jim. Your heroes are upstairs.

83
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,722
Morning.

84
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,324
Oh, cheer up. Maybe a couple of my
uniformed boys'll pick them up for you.

85
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:30,366
- That'll be the day.
- Bulletin on Benesch coming through.

86
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:39,321
If Madigan and Bonaro are sick now,
they'll be sicker when they read this.

87
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:42,445
- I'll take the carbon.
- All right, Lieutenant.

88
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:58,396
You have the right to remain silent and
refuse to answer questions. Understand?

89
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:03,516
Anything you do say may be used against
you in a court of law. Understand?

90
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:08,966
You have the right to consult an attorney
before speaking to the police.

91
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:10,321
Do you understand?

92
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:14,526
- Is that a lawyer?
- That's right. An attorney is a lawyer.

93
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:18,726
If you cannot afford an attorney, one
will be provided for you without cost.

94
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:22,163
What do I want a lawyer for? I did it.

95
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:38,921
- Congratulations (!)
- Sorry to wake you up with that kind of news.

96
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,920
Now, don't worry about it, fellas (!)

97
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,966
I woke up the District Commander.
And he woke up the Borough Commander.

98
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:49,039
The Borough Commander
woke up the Chief of Detectives.

99
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,767
And the Chief Inspector,
I can assure you,

100
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:57,001
has already presented the glad tidings
to Police Commissioner Anthony X Russell.

101
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:02,164
Now, maybe this will wake you up.

102
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:14,719
Homicide? The first bulletin said
Benesch was just wanted for questioning.

103
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:19,005
So you two decided, huh?
To pick him up?

104
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:22,318
We knew where
we could lay our hands on him.

105
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,160
So you walked in,
gave him your guns and left.

106
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:30,276
- Come on, we've got enough trouble.
- Oh, that's for sure, that's for sure.

107
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:32,805
Well, what now?

108
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:36,482
- We've got a few leads.
- Such as?

109
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:39,957
Benesch has peculiar sexual habits,
to put it mildly.

110
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,359
So has half the population,
but you can hardly call that a clue.

111
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:47,200
Anyway, our best chance
is Midget Castiglione.

112
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,437
- The bookie?
- Yeah, that's the one.

113
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:52,599
Benesch robbed him
and took him apart just for kicks.

114
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,883
Maybe because he's a midget,
I don't know.

115
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:59,325
Anyway, Castiglione likes to know
where Benesch is at all times.

116
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:02,399
- For which I can't blame him.
- Why would he tell you?

117
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:06,242
Because he owes Dan a favour, that's why.
The sooner we get to him...

118
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:10,036
Now, look, you are not going anyplace
until I hear from downtown.

119
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:13,961
You fellas may be up for
a little vacation or worse, who knows?

120
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:17,085
Meanwhile,
you better type up your reports.

121
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:25,443
By the way, you're both automatically
fined five days' pay for losing your guns.

122
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:26,696
Thanks (!)

123
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,397
Thank you, Tom.
Get yourself some breakfast.

124
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,364
Yes, sir. Thank you.

125
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:03,084
Good morning, Commissioner.

126
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:06,676
Sorry to disturb you, Sergeant.

127
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:15,282
The PC is in the building.

128
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:31,482
[Knock at door]

129
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:32,875
Come in.

130
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:37,607
- Morning.
- Morning. You the early man today?

131
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:39,359
It's more like you are.

132
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:43,361
Assistant Chief Inspector Griffen
wanted you to know he was here.

133
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:46,200
- Have him come up.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:49,040
- Good morning, Commissioner.
- Anything there can wait, Marvin?

135
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,596
It can all wait,
at least until after lunch.

136
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:56,477
But you may want to refresh your speech
to the police academy graduating class.

137
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:59,081
Unless he has a new one this year.

138
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:07,802
One o'clock, luncheon with Mrs Harriet
Dorrn of the Police Athletic League.

139
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:10,003
- At the Bethesda Fountain Café.
- All right.

140
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,523
- Three o'clock, Dr Taylor, about his son.
- I remember.

141
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,040
Four o'clock...

142
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,556
We can finish that later, Marvin.

143
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:21,643
Good morning, Commissioner.

144
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,203
Sit down, Earl.

145
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:46,475
All right, let's begin at the beginning.

146
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:50,560
We had a tap on this fella Muller,
George Muller.

147
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:54,117
That was in connection with your
investigation of Sergeant Shafer?

148
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:55,640
Yes, sir, that's correct.

149
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:58,446
Muller has this bar and grill
in the 18th Precinct.

150
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:02,122
We received a tip that known prostitutes
were frequenting the place.

151
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,996
Certain well-known suspicious characters,
who prefer not to be seen in public,

152
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,441
often met there.

153
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:11,885
The tapped phone was in the pay-booth
of a garage Muller had an interest in.

154
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:15,278
There were different kinds of
 conversations on the tapes.

155
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:19,201
While I was running through them,
I heard this voice.

156
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,678
Yes, go on, Earl.

157
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:27,806
Well, as I said, Commissioner,
I heard this voice...

158
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:33,519
You know how the Chief Inspector has
a distinctive voice and a way of talking.

159
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:47,924
I felt it was my duty to bring this
matter to your attention, Commissioner.

160
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:59,925
Is there any doubt in your mind that
the voice on that tape is Charley Kane's?

161
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:03,045
Well, as I said, the Chief Inspector...

162
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:06,961
- Assuming it is the Chief Inspector.
- I just want to know one thing.

163
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,766
Any doubt in your mind
whose voice that is?

164
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,963
No, sir. No doubt at all.

165
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:18,440
I typed this transcript of the
conversation on the tape, personally.

166
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,438
I thought you'd like to have it.

167
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:23,440
You haven't made a duplicate
and filed it, have you?

168
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,598
- No, Commissioner.
- Thank you, Earl.

169
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,725
- Anything else you want to see me about?
- Nothing urgent.

170
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:31,765
- We're working on two or three things...
- Fine.

171
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:37,479
- Is there anything you'd like me to do...?
- No, thank you. I'll let you know.

172
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:54,962
I'm sorry, Commissioner,
it had to be the Chief.

173
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,045
Thank you, Commissioner.

174
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:18,404
- Nice and neat, huh?
- Yeah.

175
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:22,162
And just enough for Russell
to hang us with.

176
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:25,364
OK, we'll send someone right over.

177
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:26,801
Come on.

178
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:33,159
Take it easy in here for a few minutes.

Hi, Rocky. How are you, honey?

182
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:49,881
I'm fine. Fine. I'll be
a little late, we had some trouble.

183
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:55,317
- That's too bad. Sure you're all right?
- Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure.

184
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,682
<i>- How are the kids?
- They're fine.</i>

- They get off to school all right?
- Yeah. Mario took his lunch again.

186
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,958
He did? Wow, that's twice this week.
I'll have to cut his allowance.

187
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:09,836
Well, I just called
because I didn't want you to worry.

188
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:14,956
All right, I've got a lot of work to do.
I'll see you later, huh? Goodbye.

No, I'm up. Where are you?

195
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,365
I'm at the station.
There was a screw-up this morning.

<i>- What happened?
- We picked up a guy and lost him.</i>

Lost him?

198
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:43,760
Just lost. What's the difference?
Now we have to find him.

199
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,077
When are you coming home?
Don't you know?

200
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:48,807
I don't, right now. I'll see how it goes.

201
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,924
Well, what am I supposed to plan?

<i>I'll try to get home and freshen up.

<i>What does that mean, "go ahead"?
Shall I wait for you, go out or what?</i>

00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:07,325
Honey, I don't know. We may get this guy
in an hour. Then again, it may be days.

205
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:11,878
Days? If this ruins the Captain's party
tomorrow, I don't know what I'll do.

206
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:14,845
- Come on, Julia.
- This is really too damn much!

207
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:16,360
<i>Listen to me, will you?</i>

208
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:19,087
I bought a new dress,
made a hair appointment...

209
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:23,081
We'll go to the Captain's party.
Just take it easy.

210
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:26,125
All right. For God's sakes, be careful.

211
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:29,199
Yeah, I'll be careful. I'll see you.

212
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:35,447
That's the whole story, Commissioner.

213
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:37,996
In my humble opinion,
Detectives Madigan and Bonaro

214
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:41,125
were acting like hicks in a cathouse,
and they were taken.

215
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:42,322
We know.

216
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,637
Plus which... these two first-class

217
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:48,243
what the Chief Inspector likes to call
"slashing detectives"

218
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:50,682
didn't even know what he was wanted for.

219
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:53,361
Come on, Hap,
you can't hold that against them.

220
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,644
Brooklyn was working
on the Kleyer killing.

221
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:59,605
They found out that
Benesch and Kleyer were friendly,

222
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:03,840
so they put it on the teletype
to bring him in for questioning.

223
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,761
Madigan and Bonaro knew him
so picked him up as a favour to Brooklyn.

224
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:10,236
Prima donnas, that's what they are.

225
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:13,683
Those "prima donnas" hold
more departmental citations

226
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:16,236
for heroism and excellent service than...

227
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:19,717
Be that as it may, they shouldn't
have gone after him alone!

228
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:22,037
While they were going after him alone,

229
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:27,076
Brooklyn found out that Benesch did do
the Kleyer killing for $1500 cold cash.

230
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:30,239
- And Benesch got both their guns, right?
- That's right.

231
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:35,481
- I'd like to hit them with a complaint now!
- For God's sakes, will you stop this?

232
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:39,322
If Madigan and Bonaro are looking for more
headlines, these'll make their head spin.

233
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:43,685
And it's not exactly the kind of image
the department needs these days.

234
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:46,281
We're not running
a public relations office, Hap.

235
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:49,200
Give them 72 hours to bring Benesch in.

236
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:50,641
As you say, Commissioner.

237
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:55,642
When the Chief of Detectives finds time,
he might assign 20 more men to this case.

238
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:59,243
Begging your pardon with all due respect,
that was done an hour ago.

239
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:01,363
- Well, thank you, Chief.
- Thank you, Chief.

240
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:05,486
- Bring him in fast. I hope nobody gets hurt.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:13,481
Now, there is a
really fine leader of men.

242
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:16,480
Two of his best goof,
and he dances for joy.

243
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:20,606
I am not at all convinced that
Madigan's one of our best men.

244
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:23,964
Haven't seen him in years,
yet I always feel he's out there

245
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,687
doing something
I'd rather not know about.

246
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:27,836
Such as?

247
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:33,365
When I was his captain,
he always wore better clothes than I did.

248
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:38,806
When I was grabbing a bite in some beanery,
he'd be eating at the Stork Club.

249
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:43,802
I never could figure it out at first. Then
I found out he was getting it for nothing.

250
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,719
"Police discount" he called it.

251
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:49,277
Sure, Madigan's always lived
a little on the arm.

252
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,200
On the other hand,
he's never been on the take.

253
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:57,077
- He's never given anything in return.
- You mean, he's never sold a job.

254
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,236
Yeah...

255
00:24:58,407 --> 00:25:00,443
Yeah, never sold out.

256
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:05,036
When will you be ready to go
to those graduation exercises?

257
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:08,165
Ten minutes. I'll see you in the car.

258
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:14,681
Well, where is he? If he isn't there,
he's got to be someplace else.

259
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:17,926
Let's go.

260
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:32,679
That new secretary of Castiglione's
has got a bad case of lockjaw.

261
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:35,884
Yeah. Well, there just might be
a cure for that.

262
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:41,682
I don't know her name.
She hit me with a shoe and left.

263
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:48,081
They gotta be kidding with this 72 hours.
What are we, miracle workers?

264
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:52,479
From anyone but Russell, I'd call it
rough. From him, it's sweet charity.

265
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:55,764
Why are we important enough for
the Commissioner's personal attention?

266
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,076
I know him well.

267
00:25:57,247 --> 00:26:00,205
He used to be a cop,
what's the matter with him?

268
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,278
I'll tell you what's the matter with him.

269
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:06,759
With him, everything's either right
or wrong. There's no in-between.

270
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:16,563
I remember once when he was
my precinct commander,

271
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:19,878
the wholesale butcher in the neighbourhood
gave out Christmas turkeys.

272
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:22,720
Every cop in the precinct got one.

273
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:28,359
Butcher wasn't asking for any favours,
he just had an attack of Santa Claus.

274
00:26:28,527 --> 00:26:31,917
But Russell sent his turkey back.

275
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:36,444
His wife was alive at the time, they
didn't have much, like the rest of us.

276
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:38,837
But he sent his back.

277
00:26:39,007 --> 00:26:41,396
What a break for the turkey.

278
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:45,155
You're smoking.

279
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,887
Yeah, sure I'm smoking.

280
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:08,566
You all right, Tony? You look
a bit off-key for graduation day.

281
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,685
I didn't sleep worth a damn last night.

282
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,404
Oh, your shoelaces is untied.

283
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:22,724
I haven't heard that for years.
My father used to say it all the time.

284
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:25,606
I miss him.
Especially on a day like today.

285
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:28,076
Do you remember that winter

286
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,966
when you and I were
nothing more than rookies

287
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:36,042
and the department had you marching
out there in the winds of Staten Island?

288
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:40,678
You froze, because you wouldn't cooperate
with the boys from Tammany Hall.

289
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:45,557
And it was Captain Kane of the old
7th Precinct that did something about it.

290
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:49,481
Two days later,
you were off Staten Island.

291
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:53,526
It was as cold in the far reaches
of the Bronx where I was,

292
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:56,565
and he didn't raise
a finger to bring me in.

293
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:59,605
I loved your father.
He was the only one I had.

294
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,997
I didn't mind sharing him with you.

295
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:06,718
Of course, he could see through me
like a pane of glass.

296
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:09,355
I remember one night, Tony,

297
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:14,442
the old man sat down across from me
with a bottle of Irish between us.

298
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:17,075
Didn't say anything,
so I didn't say anything.

299
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:20,364
The bottle went down,
and finally he said to me,

300
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:23,678
"Charley, me boy,
if the chips fall right,

301
00:28:23,847 --> 00:28:29,797
that old friend of yours, Tony Russell,
will be Commissioner one day".

302
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:33,924
He could tell by my expression
how I felt about it.

303
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,238
Not all bad. Not all good, either.

304
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,796
Then he said,
"Don't be a fool, Charley."

305
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,356
"The department is big enough
for two big men,

306
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:48,124
and if you're lucky,
one day you'll be his Chief Inspector".

307
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:52,963
Of course, the old man swore one time
he saw a leprechaun in Loew's 83rd,

308
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:56,324
so I figured he was prone
to exaggeration.

309
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:01,038
- Charley...
- Yeah?

310
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:07,921
I'll be seeing Dr Taylor about his son.
Fill me in on that.

311
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:10,647
That's a sticky one, Tony.

312
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:15,323
About two weeks ago, an hysterical mother
brought her 14-year-old daughter

313
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,239
into the Harlem Station House.

314
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:21,958
The girl had been accosted by a boy
with a knife, who forced her into his car.

315
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,083
Green two-door sedan.

316
00:29:24,247 --> 00:29:27,125
Two of the squad detectives
picked up Dr Taylor's son.

317
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:31,075
- Did they work the boy over?
- No, I checked on it. Didn't touch him.

318
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:34,557
You wouldn't leave me out on a limb
with this thing?

319
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:36,683
Have I ever?

320
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:27,880
Detectives Madigan and Bonaro.

321
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:31,084
Mr Castiglione isn't in, gentlemen.

322
00:30:33,887 --> 00:30:38,915
Just like I told you, he isn't in.
I've no idea where he is or where he went.

323
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:44,241
Don't be defensive, Miss Newman.
You have no notion where he might be?

324
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:49,640
Off for the weekend with Buster,
and that's all I know, period, Mr Madigan.

325
00:30:52,847 --> 00:30:57,921
Give us the keys to the rest of the place
or I'll tip this over on top of you.

326
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:01,238
- That's just for openers.
- There's no need... There's no...

327
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:04,479
Don't you dare! Go away!

328
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:06,638
I'll give you the keys.

329
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:16,165
I'd have given you the keys
if you'd asked for them.

330
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,319
I know you're friends of Mr Castiglione.

331
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,686
He's not hiding in there,
if that's what you're thinking.

332
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:27,875
No, no. We just wanted to make sure
in case he might've overslept.

333
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:30,402
I understood you were
two decent police officers.

334
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:34,958
When we can afford it. If he calls,
tell him Dan Madigan wants to see him

335
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,322
at once or even sooner.

336
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:38,806
You got that?

337
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:41,520
I'll tell him.

338
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,441
You do that.

339
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:04,805
- Now we're down to frightening old ladies.
- Ah, she doesn't know anything.

340
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,845
The Midget wouldn't tell her,
especially if he was holed up.

341
00:32:08,007 --> 00:32:11,044
Yeah. Well, what's next?

342
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:14,597
I hate to say this, Danny Boy,
but you look terrible.

343
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,439
So do you.

344
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:18,802
- Know how long we've been up?
- Uh-huh.

345
00:32:18,967 --> 00:32:23,597
- I could use a shave and some sleep.
- Let's grab a few hours.

346
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:37,798
It was a splendid meeting, Commissioner.
Thank you so much for joining us.

347
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:41,676
I should be thanking you, Mrs Dorrn,
for myself and the Police Athletic League.

348
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:45,044
We just know that the young people,
if given the chance,

349
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:50,520
would rather be playing baseball and football
than fighting and smoking pot.

350
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:54,202
- We like to think so, Mrs Hewitt.
- Goodbye, Commissioner.

351
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:59,487
I heard you mention Bergdorf's, Mrs Bentley.
I'm passing that way. Can I give you a lift?

352
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:02,639
That would be very kind of you,
Commissioner.

353
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:16,963
- This is unforgivable, isn't it, Tony?
- Horrible. In what way?

354
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:20,517
Fooling all those nice ladies
on the committee.

355
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:23,599
- If we are fooling them.
- You're a worrier.

356
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,598
I'm a coward.

357
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:30,196
With a very bad conscience.

358
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:35,325
My husband and children
get back on Sunday.

359
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:36,886
I know.

360
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:40,960
- What time?
- In the morning, about nine or ten.

361
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:46,807
It'll be good to see them again.

362
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:51,282
- Does that make sense to you?
- Yes, it does.

363
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:55,645
I don't know where I am, Tony.

364
00:33:58,887 --> 00:34:04,245
I went home to change
and get some things this morning.

365
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:07,444
It all sort of hit me... again.

366
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:12,561
When I'm there, I...

367
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:15,082
I just want to be with you.

368
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:20,486
And when I'm with you,
part of me is always there.

369
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:31,084
This adultery is a Ionely business, isn't it?

370
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:32,999
So it is.

371
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:38,517
I find myself missing you all the time,
even when you're with me.

372
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:42,521
Because I know that some day
you'll have to go.

373
00:34:46,887 --> 00:34:52,041
How was it you got around my determination
not to become involved with you?

374
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:54,846
And how, in heaven's name,
did you pick on me?

375
00:34:55,047 --> 00:35:00,565
You were the only member of the committee
without a theory on juvenile delinquency.

376
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:05,197
Or maybe I fell in love with you.

377
00:35:15,127 --> 00:35:19,484
<i>(TV)...and so today, my dear,
if you will follow my instructions...</i>

378
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:23,435
- Hi.
- Hi. I really didn't think you'd show up.

379
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:27,921
- Yep. I made it.
- You look beat.

380
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:33,645
- Can I fix you a drink?
- Yeah. Easy on the water.

381
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:44,557
- I suppose you've had your lunch.
- Well, I didn't know. You didn't call.

382
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:46,126
It's OK.

383
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,397
There's still some cold cuts and potato salad.

384
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,319
That'll be fine.

385
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:00,163
Oh, thanks.

386
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,999
- Helen Barry phoned a while ago.
- Yeah? How is she?

387
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:07,955
She's OK. She called to tell me
she heard about you over the radio.

388
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:11,164
"What a shame," she kept saying.
"Poor Dan."

389
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,682
- Did you catch him yet?
- No.

390
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:18,685
Helen has her faults, but she's a good friend.
I'd go crazy without her.

391
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:22,556
I don't mind Helen.
She's a bitch, but what the hell.

392
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:25,639
"But who isn't?"
Was that what you wanted to say?

393
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:26,876
No.

394
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:30,116
No, honey, no.

395
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:37,200
What are you going to be doing tonight?

396
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:42,236
The usual. Watch TV.
It's getting so it's coming out of my eyeballs.

397
00:36:42,407 --> 00:36:45,717
- I know every commercial by heart.
- Go to a movie.

398
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,639
- By myself?
- Why not?

399
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:49,525
You know I hate that.

400
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:52,121
I'd rather watch TV.

401
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:55,120
That's why I've been looking forward
to the Captain's party.

402
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:56,515
We'll go.

403
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:01,079
- Want to eat now or after your shower?
- After.

404
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:07,599
The real reason Helen called was to tell me
they're buying a cottage in Breezy Point...

405
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,076
Have I got any clean socks?

406
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,404
Oh, thanks.

407
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:20,595
I didn't say anything, but why would anybody
buy a house in a place like that?

408
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:24,760
It's so common. Cops and firemen,
that's all you ever see at Breezy Point.

409
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:28,203
As if you didn't see
enough lousy cops as it is.

410
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:31,404
Except you're one lousy cop
I never see enough of.

411
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:35,401
- Now, honey, don't start that again.
- Why can't we be like other people?

412
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,400
My brother George and Marge
have a great time together.

413
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:42,526
- He doesn't carry a gun when he's out.
- Lucky old George.

414
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:45,759
A lot you get out of it! $200 a week!

415
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:50,443
George must be good for $30 - $40,000
a year in that bar and grill of his.

416
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:53,917
- He spends every afternoon with his wife.
- Good for him.

417
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:58,239
You could be a captain, not just a crummy
detective running around the streets.

418
00:37:58,407 --> 00:38:01,638
You are smarter than most of them.
But that's not for you.

419
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:06,597
What do you care about money or respect?
As long as you're on the streets, having fun.

420
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:11,557
What about me? Think of me once in a while.
Maybe there's some kind of life I want.

421
00:38:11,727 --> 00:38:13,206
Damn it, Julia.

422
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:17,440
Why do you always have to go
into that same song and dance?

423
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:19,279
<i>[Phone rings]</i>

424
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:21,640
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Dan.</i>

425
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:23,206
Yeah?

426
00:38:24,447 --> 00:38:26,881
Buster, Castiglione's friend,
didn't he have a brother?

427
00:38:27,607 --> 00:38:30,519
<i>- Worked in the subway for the city.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

428
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:33,281
A dispatcher. Mid-town someplace.

429
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:37,719
- Check with the Transit Authority, will you?
- You got it.

430
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:41,846
- I'll pick you up in 20 minutes.
- All right. I'll see you then.

431
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:48,926
- I'll get your food.
- Honey...

432
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,964
I'm sorry.

433
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:00,242
You don't have anything on under that,
do you?

434
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:05,924
It's a little late for that now, isn't it?

435
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:28,486
I know Buster's no prize, and maybe
he isn't all there in the head.

436
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:32,879
- But he's my brother.
- He's not in any trouble. Don't worry about it.

437
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:36,483
We want to talk to the Midget,
and we figure he's with Buster.

438
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:41,038
I just hope you're giving it to me straight.
Mr Castiglione's been awful good to Buster.

439
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:43,004
We're giving it to you straight.

440
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:46,637
Stop dancing around and tell us
where we can find Buster.

441
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:51,039
Frankly, there isn't a week goes by
that Buster doesn't go to see our mother.

442
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:54,677
- They're very close, him and the old lady.
- Where does she live?

443
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:57,361
- Coney Island.
- What's the address?

444
00:39:57,527 --> 00:40:00,963
1064 Neptune Avenue. Apartment 3.

445
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:04,642
OK. So far you've been a big help, Nick.

446
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:08,959
- But don't call her, huh?
- I never do. She's deaf.

447
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:17,362
Your son does have a green two-door sedan,
doesn't he, Dr Taylor?

448
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:20,758
David's two-door sedan is a greenish blue,
Commissioner.

449
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:23,760
Not green. I bought it for him myself.

450
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:26,487
Yet your men dragged him
to the station house,

451
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:30,560
although there was no reason whatsoever
to suspect him of this crime.

452
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:34,117
It is my understanding he went voluntarily.

453
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:36,676
And there was a reason.

454
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:43,041
Your son's been arrested twice before
for molesting young girls.

455
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,358
That was two years ago.
Does that make him guilty now?

456
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,805
Dr Taylor, human behaviour patterns
are very important in police work.

457
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:54,642
A known sex offender whose name
was on the same list as your son's

458
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:57,082
finally confessed to this crime.

459
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,557
Commissioner, you don't know my son.

460
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:05,198
I admit he's made some terrible mistakes,
but that's in the past.

461
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:07,562
He's a changed boy.

462
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:09,957
- Do you have children?
- No, I don't.

463
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:15,155
Nevertheless, try to understand
how I, as a father, felt,

464
00:41:15,327 --> 00:41:17,557
after David told me what happened.

465
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:20,400
How he had been subjected
to the most outrageous pressures

466
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:23,127
to confess to a crime he didn't commit.

467
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:25,243
When my son came home to me,

468
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:28,558
he was in a state of complete
mental collapse and anguish.

469
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:31,605
He was given an opportunity
to call you or an attorney.

470
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:34,122
He was ashamed to call me.

471
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:37,518
- He didn't have to answer any questions.
- He was innocent.

472
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:39,837
Why should he keep silent?

473
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:45,035
Commissioner, you're known to be a man
who does not shrink from responsibility.

474
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:48,358
I expect you to punish these officers.

475
00:41:56,887 --> 00:41:59,355
<i>- Yes, Commissioner?
- Chief, come up, please.</i>

476
00:41:59,527 --> 00:42:02,121
<i>- I'm with Dr Taylor.
- Yes, Commissioner.</i>

477
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:05,962
Dr Taylor, the two officers involved
have been investigated thoroughly

478
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:10,643
and cleared of any suspicion
of brutality or unreasonable conduct.

479
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:16,723
Sir, I came here for justice,
and I'm going to get it.

480
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:21,438
But I don't want a policeman's idea of justice.
I want the victim's idea of justice.

481
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:24,804
From the bottom looking up,
not from the top looking down.

482
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:28,801
I think you're talking about revenge
not justice.

483
00:42:33,487 --> 00:42:38,436
Commissioner, during the Harlem riots,
I was called an Uncle Tom

484
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:42,725
for using whatever influence I had
to bring about peace and understanding.

485
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:45,720
- Was I wrong?
- You were right, Doctor.

486
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,596
Prove it, Commissioner.
You prove it to me.

487
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,564
- [Knock at door]
- Come in.

488
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:56,124
- You know Chief Inspector Kane. Dr Taylor.
- Nice to see you again.

489
00:42:56,287 --> 00:43:00,200
Chief, are these the facts
in the Taylor situation?

490
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:04,360
Yes, the Chief of Detectives investigated
this matter and reported his findings to me.

491
00:43:04,527 --> 00:43:07,917
I want you personally to see
Detectives Bowler and Silvers.

492
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:11,966
Make your report to me.
Can I get back to you on Monday?

493
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:14,595
- I'll be expecting your call.
- You'll hear from me.

494
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:18,203
When a police officer does his job properly,
I'm prepared to back him.

495
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,881
When he doesn't, I'm ready to break him.

496
00:43:21,047 --> 00:43:26,804
There must be one rule for every man
charged with protection of the community.

497
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:31,040
Chief Kane will tell you our men are
expected not only to enforce the law

498
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:34,005
but to live under it themselves.

499
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:36,758
That's a comforting thought, gentlemen.

500
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:28,198
No, it's OK, Buster.

501
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:30,198
- Hiya, Midge.
- Dan!

502
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,164
- How are you?
- Fine.

503
00:44:32,327 --> 00:44:35,763
Rocky. What are you guys
doing out here in Coney Island?

504
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:38,566
Came down for a hot dog,
what do you think?

505
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:42,197
We've been looking for you.
Don't you call your office?

506
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,801
Why? I can read about it in the papers.

507
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:50,325
You can read your own obituary, too,
if Benesch catches up with you.

508
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:53,524
Bodyguard or no bodyguard.

509
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:56,645
One rap more won't make
any difference to him.

510
00:44:56,807 --> 00:45:00,163
Yeah, I know.
I figured that, that's why I panicked.

511
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:04,320
You know I'm not the biggest coward
in the world, but that guy scares me.

512
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:09,356
I heard that bad news, so I figured I can
come out here with Buster and his mother

513
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:11,961
until you guys collect that crazy nut cake.

514
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:14,925
Well, we're gonna need a little help, Midge.

515
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:19,085
Like... you got a couple of dozen customers

516
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:22,478
who don't mind talking
to their favourite bookie.

517
00:45:22,647 --> 00:45:25,923
- Sure, I can make a couple of calls...
- You're not listening.

518
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:28,647
We want Benesch now, not next Christmas.

519
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:32,482
The longer he's loose,
the shorter your lifespan, right?

520
00:45:34,807 --> 00:45:36,843
Yeah, well, I know.

521
00:45:37,007 --> 00:45:39,396
That punk shacked up in some pad,

522
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:44,083
tee-veeing it with a couple of broads
to take his mind of the commercials.

523
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:46,397
Somebody's gotta know something.

524
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:51,482
Some pimp, maybe,
who won't talk to us but will to you.

525
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:55,157
Time for you to come home, Midge.

526
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,841
You're too far away from the action.

527
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:08,085
Oh, I had it with the fresh air, anyway.
You're my friend, Dan, and I owe you.

528
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:13,526
Just make sure you give me a nice funeral
in case he makes me before you make him.

529
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:21,956
OK.

530
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:26,120
Let's go and try a couple of those
luxurious army cots, I'm beat.

531
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:27,276
You go.

532
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:30,405
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know. Maybe go dancing.

533
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:33,001
You're out on your feet.
Let's get some sleep.

534
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,556
I'll let you know where I am.

535
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:39,162
Keep in touch.

536
00:46:45,007 --> 00:46:51,401
<i># And how lips that taste of tears</i>

537
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:56,357
<i># Lose their taste for kissing</i>

538
00:46:57,127 --> 00:46:59,687
<i># You don't know</i>

00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:03,556

00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:23,525
<i># What love is #</i>

544
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:37,636
Hi.

545
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:42,162
- Well, at least you're alive.
- Hard to tell. Drink?

546
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:48,637
Damn newspapers. I felt so lousy.
You'd think you were the criminal.

547
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:51,275
Jonesy, you're a good girl.

548
00:47:51,447 --> 00:47:56,123
Tell me more.
I'm here for comfort and sympathy.

549
00:47:56,287 --> 00:48:00,724
- Do you love me just a little?
- After my wife, I love you best.

550
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:03,196
At least I haven't lost any ground.

551
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:07,042
Take it easy with that stuff, there's water in it.

552
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:14,482
- How's the world's sexiest singer?
- Great.

553
00:48:14,647 --> 00:48:17,081
- Come home with me tonight?
- Oh, come on.

554
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:21,798
- You know how I feel about you.
- Yeah, I remind you of your father.

555
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:24,481
The hell you do.

556
00:48:24,647 --> 00:48:26,763
You've had it, I think.

557
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:35,396
OK.

558
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:37,516
Check.

559
00:48:38,727 --> 00:48:42,197
Compliments of the house, Mr Madigan.
Always a pleasure to have you here.

560
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:43,925
Thank you very much.

561
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,159
- Tell the boys I'm cutting out, OK?
- Yes, Miss Jones.

562
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:48,999
We got a cab right outside.

563
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:53,240
- Where am I going?
- Beddy-bye, and it won't hurt a bit.

564
00:48:56,647 --> 00:49:01,846
Yeah, you're right, they shouldn't see me
like this at the station house,

565
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:05,841
when I'm supposed to be looking
for the bastard that grabbed my gun.

566
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:08,123
I'll buy you a new one.

567
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:11,836
- You can't sleep in your suit, you'll ruin it.
- No!

568
00:49:34,927 --> 00:49:36,724
Clean sheets.

569
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,879
What time do you want the alarm for?
6.30? 7.00?

570
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:45,485
Oh, I forgot. Call Rocky at the station
house and leave this number.

571
00:49:45,647 --> 00:49:49,196
- He'll call me if anything breaks.
- OK.

572
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:52,120
I promised to leave a number. He'll call me.

573
00:49:54,287 --> 00:49:57,199
You know I'm not kidding, Dan.

574
00:49:57,367 --> 00:50:01,599
Why can't it be like it was
before you got married?

575
00:50:03,887 --> 00:50:06,082
I'm in love with Julia.

576
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:18,716
Who's asking for love?

577
00:51:13,607 --> 00:51:19,000
- Where the hell have you been, Dan?
- Don't give me any trouble. Get in here.

578
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:24,358
I had to go back to the Flame Club
for the damn car.

579
00:51:24,527 --> 00:51:26,597
Some jerk gave me a ticket.

580
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:29,679
- It's a great day already.
- Yeah.

581
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:32,520
OK, who's this guy who called?

582
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:35,679
Says he's a friend of yours.
Name of Mickey Dunn.

583
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:40,875
Oh, yeah. Used to be a boxer.
Haven't seen him for six, seven years.

584
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:44,517
Well, he says he just saw Benesch
in McGinty's Bar.

585
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,678
- You believe it?
- I'd like to.

586
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:51,204
Your buddy must be some lush, sitting
in a bar at this hour of the morning.

587
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:54,757
How can we take a chance not to check?

588
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:57,964
Can't you move this thing any faster?

589
00:52:12,527 --> 00:52:16,315
You can open the other eye now,
I made the coffee.

590
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,563
- Did you get some sleep?
- Enough.

591
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:38,477
- You thrashed around all night.
- I did? I don't remember.

592
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:41,798
Oh, you'd make a terrible witness.

593
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:48,006
- Have you always been this hard to reach?
- I've been accused of it.

594
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:54,557
My friend Charley Kane has done me in.

595
00:52:54,727 --> 00:52:58,322
Oh, Tony. But that's hard to believe.

596
00:52:58,487 --> 00:53:01,638
- How could he do it?
- Ask him.

597
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:05,720
I don't know what the trouble is,
but you should give him a chance.

598
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:09,118
- He's your friend.
- One of two.

599
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:12,640
Perhaps you're being too hard
on him and yourself.

600
00:53:12,807 --> 00:53:15,526
Oh, there's only one way.

601
00:53:15,687 --> 00:53:18,520
- Now you sound like a cop.
- I am a cop.

602
00:53:18,687 --> 00:53:23,158
No, you're the Police Commissioner,
and Charley Kane's your friend.

603
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:28,244
And friends aren't meant to be judged,
just loved.

604
00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:31,205
You mean, separate rules for Charley

605
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:34,643
when I don't even have them for myself?

606
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:40,086
What about you and me in your bedroom?
Is there a separate rule for us?

607
00:53:40,247 --> 00:53:45,640
I suppose not. You're right. I didn't think
we were talking about the same thing.

608
00:53:49,807 --> 00:53:50,796
Tony...

609
00:53:57,967 --> 00:54:01,403
Work it out with him.
It's so important to both of you.

610
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:04,798
- I'll do what I have to.
- I know, I know.

611
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:10,087
Remember, people are more complicated
than you'd like them to be.

612
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:15,765
- And that includes you and me.
- Will you be still here tonight?

613
00:54:26,407 --> 00:54:29,046
I'm going to miss you.

614
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:01,080
- Hi, Dan.
- Hi, Mick.

615
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:04,796
- I hope I didn't bring you here for nothing.
- What's doing?

616
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:08,039
Benesch. He's still sitting in the bar
over there.

617
00:55:08,207 --> 00:55:12,086
I've been standing here since I made
that call, and he never come out.

618
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:14,636
- Is there a back door?
- On the alley.

619
00:55:14,807 --> 00:55:17,162
- You want to be a real help?
- Yeah.

620
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:21,366
You go in the front. If he's still there,
open the back door for us.

621
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:25,486
Then we'll see what happens.
Anything pops, take a dive.

622
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:29,765
Sure. I hope it's the right guy,
'cause I'm only going from his picture.

623
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:34,523
Yeah, sure. Just don't stand around
in case there's fireworks, OK?

624
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:48,677
- What do you want?
- Sorry. I thought you were from Cincinnati.

625
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:51,281
- Are you a wise guy?
- I said I was sorry.

626
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:55,679
Nobody tells me
I look like I'm from Cincinnati.

627
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:04,323
Now be a good boy and drink your milk.

628
00:57:07,287 --> 00:57:11,200
Dan, I'm awful sorry
I got you out on a bum steer.

629
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:16,043
- It's OK. Let me buy you a drink.
- You don't have to do that.

630
00:57:16,207 --> 00:57:19,358
I'm sorry, fellas.
I could've sworn that was Benesch.

631
00:57:19,527 --> 00:57:22,246
- This is on the house, boys.
- Thanks.

632
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:26,116
- Take it easy, Mick. I'll see you around.
- You bet.

633
00:57:26,287 --> 00:57:31,315
You're a sight for sore eyes, Dan.
You look great.

634
00:57:31,487 --> 00:57:35,366
Oh, no. No, no, Dan.
I'm not that far down on my luck.

635
00:57:35,527 --> 00:57:36,516
Take it.

636
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:39,797
Take care of yourself.

637
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:48,604
I've known those guys for 15 years.

638
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:51,281
Nice guys. The best.

639
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:56,281
Once more, eh, Chuck?

640
00:57:56,447 --> 00:58:00,201
Boy, you and your friends.
Where do you find them?

641
00:58:00,367 --> 00:58:02,483
They find me.

642
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:08,843
- You know what that was all about?
- No, what?

643
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:10,998
He was Ionely.

644
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:29,766
- Know what, Dan?
- What?

645
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:35,357
I got a lousy feeling our time is running out.

646
00:58:35,527 --> 00:58:36,516
Yeah.

647
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:39,439
It's funny.

648
00:58:39,607 --> 00:58:43,202
I was just thinking about
Russell and that turkey.

649
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:46,404
<i>- Car one-twelve, car one-twelve?
- That's us.</i>

650
00:58:46,567 --> 00:58:48,523
Maybe it's something.

651
00:58:49,447 --> 00:58:52,723
One-twelve to central.
One-twelve to central, K.

652
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:56,402
<i>Respond to the southeast corner
of 104th Street and Broadway.</i>

653
00:58:56,567 --> 00:59:00,446
<i>104th Street and Broadway.
See the complainant at luncheonette.</i>

654
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:03,041
One-twelve to central. 10-4.

655
00:59:09,407 --> 00:59:12,285
- Is there anything else, Commissioner?
- No, thank you, Marvin.

656
00:59:12,447 --> 00:59:14,165
- [Knock]
- Yes?

657
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:17,762
- Oh, good morning. Morning, Tony.
- Charley.

658
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:22,125
This morning's case sheet.
Two bad knifings and a homicide in Brooklyn.

659
00:59:22,287 --> 00:59:24,278
- Not good.
- No.

660
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:27,757
- Is the homicide a gang thing?
- Yes. It looks like that.

661
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:32,478
A jurisdictional dispute. There'll be more.
Be nice if they killed each other off.

662
00:59:32,647 --> 00:59:35,844
- Anything new on Benesch?
- No. When it breaks, it'll break fast.

663
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:40,398
Bowler and Silvers, on the Taylor case,
I just had them in this morning.

664
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:44,446
Went over it thoroughly, they're clean.
They did their duty and nothing more.

665
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:47,679
I'll stake my reputation on it.

666
00:59:47,847 --> 00:59:50,645
- Well, that's that.
- No...

667
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:53,640
We've still got to tell Dr Taylor something.

668
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:57,163
That poor boy of his is precious to him.

669
01:00:01,927 --> 01:00:05,283
Something's eating you, Tony.
What's on your mind?

670
01:00:21,687 --> 01:00:24,121
I can also play it for you.

671
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:31,396
Well...

672
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:37,006
I was afraid this might be it.

673
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:42,321
I figured that if it was,
the only thing to do was to say, "Well."

674
01:00:42,487 --> 01:00:45,365
"You got caught with your hand in the till,
Charley."

675
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:49,645
And then the next thing to do
was to walk out, possibly...

676
01:00:51,407 --> 01:00:56,925
Just possibly, your old friend might
let you do it with a bit of grace.

677
01:00:57,927 --> 01:01:01,920
- That's the way I figured it.
- Tell me about it, Charley.

678
01:01:02,087 --> 01:01:06,000
What difference does it make?
I got tapped by Griffen. There it is.

679
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:09,159
Never mind that, I want an explanation.
What's behind this?

680
01:01:09,327 --> 01:01:12,319
[Irish accent] There's nothing behind it at all,
at all, me boy.

681
01:01:12,487 --> 01:01:15,843
I'll just put in me papers,
with your permission, and leave quietly.

682
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:19,920
Never mind the phoney brogue.
Tell me what this is all about.

683
01:01:20,087 --> 01:01:22,476
- Is that an order, Commissioner?
- Damn right it is.

684
01:01:22,647 --> 01:01:25,525
What more do you want? You got the facts.

685
01:01:27,607 --> 01:01:31,885
- I did a contract for Muller.
- It's your boy, isn't it?

686
01:01:38,247 --> 01:01:43,321
- How in the hell did you know that?
- I guessed. I want to hear it from you.

687
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:46,923
You always had reservations
about young Charley, didn't you?

688
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:49,476
Had a couple myself,
down through the years.

689
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:53,560
But Patrolman Charley Kane Junior
is a nice kid.

690
01:01:53,727 --> 01:01:56,958
And he's gonna be a hell of a cop one day.

691
01:01:57,127 --> 01:02:00,039
Oldest story in the world, Tony.

692
01:02:00,207 --> 01:02:04,485
He and his nitwit wife were in hock

693
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:07,844
to a loan association for $3,000.

694
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:12,125
The girl's got two fur coats.
Can you imagine that?

695
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:15,677
A 21 -year-old girl with two fur coats.

696
01:02:15,847 --> 01:02:20,796
Anyway, Muller knew he needed the dough,
so he passed it to the boy...

697
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:26,518
...in return for keeping the Vice and Gambling
Squad from raiding Muller's premises.

698
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:28,803
When the kid couldn't keep the bargain,

699
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:32,642
Muller threatened to turn him in
for accepting a bribe.

700
01:02:32,807 --> 01:02:35,958
Muller's no fool, he knew
the kid would come to me.

701
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:39,483
- Pretty smart for a punk like Muller.
- Yeah...

702
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:42,320
- Go on.
- Nothing.

703
01:02:44,567 --> 01:02:46,797
Fourth generation of Kanes...

704
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:52,926
...and I'm the first one to get himself
kicked out of the department.

705
01:02:53,087 --> 01:02:56,523
That's one thing the old man
didn't see in that bottle of Irish.

706
01:02:56,687 --> 01:02:59,759
- What kind of money are we talking about?
- $3500.

707
01:02:59,927 --> 01:03:04,159
- Why didn't you just give it back to Muller?
- He wouldn't take it.

708
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:09,843
Your boy couldn't do his dirty contract,
so you did it for him?

709
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:12,885
- You might put it that way.
- How would you put it?

710
01:03:13,047 --> 01:03:16,642
Well, that's easy, Tony.
I wanted to save the kid's neck.

711
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:19,799
You've sold yourself, the department
and me down the river

712
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:22,356
in the name of fatherhood?

713
01:03:22,527 --> 01:03:26,361
What in the living hell
do you know about fatherhood?

714
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,641
Nothing. But I do know Earl Griffen.

715
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:37,278
You think he'll cover for you or me
in front of a Grand Jury?

716
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:41,281
My ears are still pretty good.
You don't have to shout.

717
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:44,678
What am I supposed to do with that?

718
01:03:44,847 --> 01:03:48,522
Commissioner, I thought you'd never ask.

719
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:13,724
I've been waiting for you.
Can I get you an egg cream?

720
01:04:13,887 --> 01:04:16,276
Never mind the egg cream.
What have you got?

721
01:04:16,447 --> 01:04:19,803
- See the movie house down the street?
- Yeah, we see it.

722
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:23,198
OK, left side of the aisle,
ten rows from the back,

723
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:25,119
you'll find a young boy, Hughie.

724
01:04:25,287 --> 01:04:28,677
He's wearing a black jacket,
green corduroy pants,

725
01:04:28,847 --> 01:04:31,725
a gold sweater and a head full of hair.

726
01:04:31,887 --> 01:04:35,516
- Kind of pretty, ain't he, Buster?
- Hughie what? Do we know him?

727
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:39,441
No, he's nothing. But once
he drove a car in a heist for Benesch.

728
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:44,556
Being a cute fella with the ladies,
he helps Benesch out with a few girls.

729
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,365
Sounds all right, Midge.

730
01:04:46,527 --> 01:04:50,440
- What's he doing in there this time of day?
- Waiting for night.

731
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:52,643
- Thanks, Midge.
- I done good, didn't I?

732
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:56,800
If it works, it's good.
If it doesn't, it's lousy.

733
01:04:56,967 --> 01:04:59,845
Yeah, you're right, Dan.

734
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:13,476
Hughie?

735
01:05:14,807 --> 01:05:16,479
Who are you?

736
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:18,285
Police, Hughie.

737
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,756
Detective Madigan.

738
01:05:20,927 --> 01:05:23,077
That's Detective Bonaro.

739
01:05:24,127 --> 01:05:28,120
- What do you want with me?
- We want to talk to you.

740
01:05:28,287 --> 01:05:31,245
- I'm watching the show.
- We know you're watching the show.

741
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:34,444
- Come on.
- What is this? I ain't done nothing!

742
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:36,563
Come on, move it.

743
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:45,045
Sit down.

744
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:51,204
So your name is Hughie, huh?
Haven't we seen you before?

745
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:53,403
No. I ain't never been busted.

746
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:56,400
Don't get excited. Nobody's gonna bust you.

747
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:59,206
We want to talk to you
about Barney Benesch.

748
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:02,439
You've no rights to do this. I want a lawyer!

749
01:06:02,607 --> 01:06:06,316
- What did you do that for?
- Do what for, huh?

750
01:06:06,487 --> 01:06:09,001
Come on, Rocky.
Give the kid a break.

751
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:14,560
Come on. He wants to cooperate.
Don't you, Hughie?

752
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:19,721
You see, I was just trying to explain
a little law to him, that's all.

753
01:06:25,807 --> 01:06:27,604
Cigarette, Hughie?

754
01:06:33,287 --> 01:06:35,596
Now, listen, Hughie.

755
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:38,645
You forget that partner of mine.

756
01:06:38,807 --> 01:06:41,560
It's just you and me.

757
01:06:43,087 --> 01:06:45,760
You tell us where we can find Benesch,

758
01:06:45,927 --> 01:06:49,283
you'll see the rest of the show
in no time at all.

759
01:06:49,447 --> 01:06:52,359
I know nothing about Benesch
and I ain't no stool pigeon!

760
01:06:52,527 --> 01:06:57,521
I know you're no stool pigeon.
You're a pretty straight guy, I can see that.

761
01:06:58,127 --> 01:07:02,120
Even though you did help Barney
on a little job a while ago.

762
01:07:02,287 --> 01:07:03,436
Right?

763
01:07:04,407 --> 01:07:07,319
Yeah... I mean, no!
I don't know what you're talking about!

764
01:07:07,487 --> 01:07:13,244
Hughie, either you talk to me
or Rocky Bonaro. Which do you take?

765
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:17,996
Wait, Mr...?

766
01:07:20,887 --> 01:07:22,366
Madigan.

767
01:07:23,527 --> 01:07:26,917
- Just call me Dan.
- Well...

768
01:07:27,087 --> 01:07:28,759
Well, Dan.

769
01:07:29,847 --> 01:07:31,917
Honest, I don't know much.

770
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:34,362
- You don't, huh?
- No.

771
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:39,840
Let's do it this way. Let me ask you one
or two things. You give it to me straight?

772
01:07:40,007 --> 01:07:44,205
- Yeah.
- We know you sent Barney a few girls.

773
01:07:44,367 --> 01:07:45,356
Huh?

774
01:07:47,447 --> 01:07:50,120
- Well, I didn't want to.
- No?

775
01:07:50,287 --> 01:07:53,324
But this guy Benesch calls me at my house.

776
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:57,719
He's always saying why don't I fix him up.
He's a freak!

777
01:07:57,887 --> 01:08:01,163
Always saying
why don't we get together with some girls.

778
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:05,002
- So you did, right?
- Yeah, I sent him a few, once in a while.

779
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:07,806
It's the only way to keep him off my back.

780
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:11,437
When I say I don't know where Benesch is,
this just ain't talk.

781
01:08:11,607 --> 01:08:14,565
Because he moves all the time.

782
01:08:14,727 --> 01:08:18,436
He wants a girl,
he says send her here, send her there.

783
01:08:18,607 --> 01:08:20,598
The next time, it's someplace else.

784
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:25,636
- What about a girl he might be with now?
- Honest, I don't know.

785
01:08:25,807 --> 01:08:30,676
- There's this girl named Rosita he likes.
- We know her. Who else?

786
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:35,204
There's this other one, a junkie.
Name of Sarah.

787
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:39,838
I don't think he likes her so hot. Junkies
are too dead. That was three months ago.

788
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:41,156
- Who else?
- Who else?

789
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:42,362
Who else?

790
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:48,118
There were these sisters,
named Stella and Doreen.

791
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:53,156
They always hang out at the Bongo Club.
Something new for Benesch, sisters!

792
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:57,002
Then there's this other place called
the Pale Moon. They work both places.

793
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:00,125
- Where do they live?
- Honest, I don't know!

794
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,882
They hang out at these two clubs
starting 10 o'clock every evening.

795
01:09:04,047 --> 01:09:08,837
- They call you once in a while, right?
- Yeah, to find where the action is.

796
01:09:09,007 --> 01:09:12,841
- Where do they call you?
- Home. Where else?

797
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:17,116
All right, Hughie.

798
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:20,882
Write your address
and phone number down, will you?

799
01:09:24,487 --> 01:09:28,400
- Don't worry about him, Hughie.
- You been a good boy, Hughie?

800
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:32,321
Sure he has, Rock.
He's gonna give us a little hand tonight.

801
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:37,322
We'll pick him up 10 o'clock
and go for a little ride around town.

802
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:40,718
You live at this address all the time, Hughie?

803
01:09:40,887 --> 01:09:44,596
Yeah, most of the time.
I move around a little bit, too.

804
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:49,042
This your place or you live with somebody?

805
01:09:49,207 --> 01:09:52,244
It's my old lady's place. My ma's.

806
01:09:52,407 --> 01:09:56,366
Hughie, if you had any brains,
you'd spend more time with her after this.

807
01:09:56,527 --> 01:10:00,839
- Yeah, I know.
- After tonight, he means. See you later.

808
01:10:01,007 --> 01:10:03,646
Hope you didn't miss too much of the movie.

809
01:10:03,807 --> 01:10:06,719
Yeah. I've seen it before.

810
01:10:07,727 --> 01:10:09,922
That kid needs a haircut.

811
01:10:13,287 --> 01:10:15,323
[Knock at door]

812
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:16,476
Come in.

813
01:10:20,647 --> 01:10:22,922
You forgot your shield.

814
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:27,798
How could I have done that?

815
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:31,084
When I'm ready to pick it up,
I'll let you know.

816
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:33,841
See you tonight at the Captain's party.

817
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:55,161
- Good evening, Mr Madigan.
- Hiya.

818
01:10:56,607 --> 01:11:00,282
- Soon as I find a sitter for Julia, I'll buzz you.
- Wait a minute.

819
01:11:00,447 --> 01:11:02,756
- What?
- I still think you're nuts for going.

820
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:06,078
Suppose somebody sees you?
Like some of the top brass?

821
01:11:06,247 --> 01:11:08,477
They wouldn't believe it.

822
01:11:21,287 --> 01:11:22,879
- Good evening, Mr Madigan.
- Good evening.

823
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:27,837
Nice to have you with us. Mrs Madigan
is in suite 1004. I'll think you'll like it.

824
01:11:28,007 --> 01:11:32,364
- Good. Have you got a extra key?
- Oh, certainly, Mr Madigan.

825
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:37,758
- If there's anything we can do, let us know.
- Thank you very much.

826
01:11:49,527 --> 01:11:51,722
- Dan!
- Hi, darling.

827
01:11:53,247 --> 01:11:54,726
Well!

828
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:08,321
That feels good.
I've been on a starvation diet.

829
01:12:08,487 --> 01:12:12,480
- Where have you been keeping yourself?
- Oh, you're comical.

830
01:12:13,847 --> 01:12:16,122
- Did you find him?
- Who?

831
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:19,040
- The man you lost.
- Uh-huh.

832
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:23,359
But I have to leave early tonight.
There may be a break in the case.

833
01:12:23,527 --> 01:12:26,041
Early? What about me?

834
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:30,041
Don't worry,
the party will be full of friendly bachelors,

835
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,359
good for a few extra dances
and a ride back to the hotel.

836
01:12:34,527 --> 01:12:37,724
- Fine. We can shop for him together.
- Not bad for free.

837
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,400
Not bad.

838
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:43,196
- I guess they want to keep our business.
- I guess so.

839
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:47,838
What'll you have? Apples? Pears? Bananas?
Scotch? Bourbon? Or just plain ice?

840
01:12:48,007 --> 01:12:52,364
[Scottish accent] I'll have you, with a wee bit of
Scotch, not on the rocks.

841
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:56,361
Better be careful.
Hotel rooms do something to me.

842
01:12:56,527 --> 01:12:57,516
I know.

843
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:05,121
- Let's make it a good party, starting now.
- OK. I'm for that.

844
01:13:05,287 --> 01:13:06,959
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

845
01:13:11,087 --> 01:13:14,636
- What did you do today?
- Oh, nothing much.

846
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:26,086
Wow.

847
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,039
That's nice.

848
01:13:30,207 --> 01:13:34,120
- Did I ever tell you I was hooked on knees?
- Only mine, I hope.

849
01:13:34,287 --> 01:13:36,278
Only yours.

850
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,116
How much time do we have?

851
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:51,597
Not too much. I have to clean up.

852
01:13:51,767 --> 01:13:54,759
Settle you down at the party.

853
01:13:54,927 --> 01:13:58,317
Get back on the job before Russell sees me.

854
01:13:58,487 --> 01:14:03,163
Oh, damn! Damn Russell!
I'm sick and tired of you and Russell.

855
01:14:03,327 --> 01:14:06,285
I'm fed up with the name Russell.
Who is Russell?

856
01:14:06,447 --> 01:14:09,245
A shanty Irish nobody from the slums!
I could scream!

857
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:10,999
Calm down. Take it easy.

858
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:14,204
I want to go to a party.
Who gets in? Russell!

859
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:18,360
I feel like going to bed. Who gets in?
Russell! I'm sick of Russell!

860
01:14:18,527 --> 01:14:20,563
Now, hold it.

861
01:14:20,727 --> 01:14:24,686
You've got a pretty dress to wear,
you look great, you'll be a knockout.

862
01:14:24,847 --> 01:14:29,398
You know I shouldn't be going to this thing,
but I don't want to disappoint you.

863
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:31,922
Disappoint me?
For the 10 minutes you're there?

864
01:14:32,087 --> 01:14:35,284
Come on, Julia, be a sport.
I'm up to here in it!

865
01:14:35,447 --> 01:14:38,519
If we don't get a break,
it'll be over our heads.

866
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:42,805
As far as I'm concerned,
it's over your head right now.

867
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:11,400
Good evening.

868
01:15:12,647 --> 01:15:13,636
Thank you.

869
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:15,001
Honey...

870
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:25,606
- A gun under every tuxedo.
- That's right.

871
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:32,319
Are we just gonna stand here
or are we going in?

872
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,239
Wait a second. Just a second.

873
01:15:36,087 --> 01:15:38,237
- Hey, Ben.
- Dan!

874
01:15:38,407 --> 01:15:39,601
- How are you?
- Good.

875
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:42,327
Good to see you.
You know my wife, Ben?

876
01:15:42,487 --> 01:15:44,921
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

877
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:47,920
- Having a good time?
- Oh, just great.

878
01:15:48,087 --> 01:15:50,920
- Who are you with?
- Nobody, I'm batching it tonight.

879
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:53,647
Is that a fact? Well, you're in luck.

880
01:15:53,807 --> 01:15:57,004
- Where's your stub?
- My stub? What stub?

881
01:15:57,167 --> 01:16:00,125
- You just won the door prize.
- Oh, Dan...

882
01:16:00,287 --> 01:16:04,121
I got a bad leg, it's very bad,
and Julia's dying to dance.

883
01:16:04,287 --> 01:16:09,042
- Say no more. My pleasure, Julia.
- Good. Have fun, honey.

884
01:16:24,887 --> 01:16:26,605
Oh...

885
01:16:28,007 --> 01:16:30,521
- Good evening, Commissioner.
- Hello, Dan.

886
01:16:30,687 --> 01:16:33,520
I'm fine, thanks, Commissioner. I'm just fine.

887
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:38,446
I just left the wife... I just left her.

888
01:16:39,447 --> 01:16:43,725
As a matter of fact,
I'm on my way uptown right now.

889
01:16:43,887 --> 01:16:47,960
I didn't want her to miss the party.
She's been looking forward to it...

890
01:16:48,127 --> 01:16:52,040
- I was just gonna call my partner.
- I see.

891
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,324
I thought for a minute I didn't have a dime,

892
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:58,445
and I was wondering
where I could get change,

893
01:16:58,607 --> 01:17:01,599
but it turned out I had a dime after all.

894
01:17:01,767 --> 01:17:05,123
Interesting.
Well, good to see you, Dan.

895
01:17:07,087 --> 01:17:08,315
Sorry, sir.

896
01:17:08,487 --> 01:17:11,843
- Anything new on Benesch, by the way?
- No, sir. Not yet.

897
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:16,478
But something's bound to break pretty soon,
I'm sure of that.

898
01:17:16,647 --> 01:17:19,525
I was just on my way to call my partner.

899
01:17:19,687 --> 01:17:21,837
So you said. Goodnight.

900
01:17:24,047 --> 01:17:25,639
Goodnight, sir.

901
01:17:36,007 --> 01:17:40,523
<i>179th and Amsterdam, 10-21 in a collision.
179 and Amsterdam.</i>

902
01:17:40,687 --> 01:17:42,325
Something wrong?

903
01:17:42,487 --> 01:17:45,957
<i>Man tampering with an auto.
267 West...</i>

904
01:17:46,807 --> 01:17:52,006
Stop the car, Sam. Watch yourself.
This might be Benesch and it might not.

905
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:55,039
Hold it a minute, fella.

906
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:14,796
Hey, Julia.
What do you say we get out of here?

907
01:18:14,967 --> 01:18:19,757
I know a noisy little place
where we can have a quiet little drink.

908
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:21,883
Sounds fun.

909
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:25,483
Just one more dance
and then we'll go, OK?

910
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:26,636
OK.

911
01:18:40,647 --> 01:18:43,525
How long has he been in there?

912
01:18:43,687 --> 01:18:45,643
A year, I think.

913
01:18:48,727 --> 01:18:50,558
What are you doing, Hughie?

914
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:54,003
What am I doing? Nothing.
Doreen and Stella been around?

915
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:56,317
- Maybe they're at the Bongo.
- Nah. Been there.

916
01:18:56,487 --> 01:19:01,003
Hey, Hughie? We're going on
to a couple of places. What do you say?

917
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:03,635
Nah. I'm going home.

918
01:19:23,407 --> 01:19:28,197
- You find him, Hughie?
- No. But I think I got something.

919
01:19:28,367 --> 01:19:32,679
Ross the bartender ain't seen
Stella and Doreen since Friday night,

920
01:19:32,847 --> 01:19:36,123
but he heard they were gonna meet
Barney Benesch for a party.

921
01:19:36,287 --> 01:19:39,563
- He say where?
- No, that's all he heard.

922
01:19:39,727 --> 01:19:42,161
- He asked around. Nobody's seen him.
- You leave word?

923
01:19:42,327 --> 01:19:44,318
Sure. Just like you told me.

924
01:19:44,487 --> 01:19:47,843
If they show, they got the word
to give me a ring.

925
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:50,726
All right, kid. Don't get too much sleep.

926
01:19:52,047 --> 01:19:56,882
You got a lot of nosying around to do,
till we turn up those sisters.

927
01:19:57,047 --> 01:20:00,437
- You understand me, don't you, Hughie?
- Yeah.

928
01:20:00,607 --> 01:20:03,883
- Gee, but I ain't no cop!
- Now don't get smart.

929
01:20:04,047 --> 01:20:07,756
Right now, you're a cop
whether you like it or not.

930
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:11,283
Now stay down.
We'll drive you to your house.

931
01:20:20,927 --> 01:20:23,122
[Siren winds down]

932
01:20:31,487 --> 01:20:34,206
- Why haven't you taken him in?
- Bullet grazed his windpipe.

933
01:20:34,367 --> 01:20:37,723
I had to make sure he could breathe
before we moved him.

934
01:20:37,887 --> 01:20:40,685
Commissioner Russell, son.

935
01:20:40,847 --> 01:20:44,078
You and your partner performed bravely.

936
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:46,476
Commissioner...

937
01:20:49,647 --> 01:20:51,797
How's Phil?

938
01:20:56,847 --> 01:20:59,281
You don't have to worry about him.

939
01:20:59,447 --> 01:21:01,324
Lift him in.

940
01:21:09,727 --> 01:21:11,843
Commissioner. Chief.

941
01:21:12,007 --> 01:21:13,599
Detective's special.

942
01:21:13,767 --> 01:21:16,201
Looks like Benesch dropped it.

943
01:21:39,847 --> 01:21:42,281
Recognise this, Dan?

944
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:46,961
Yes, sir. It's mine.

945
01:22:10,247 --> 01:22:11,885
Easy now.

946
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:14,723
How about a kiss?

947
01:22:16,287 --> 01:22:18,084
One more time.

948
01:22:23,327 --> 01:22:26,444
Easy now. That's the kid.

949
01:22:26,607 --> 01:22:27,722
Now...

950
01:23:13,487 --> 01:23:15,364
Oh, yes.

951
01:23:15,527 --> 01:23:16,562
Oh, yes.

952
01:23:16,727 --> 01:23:19,287
Oh, baby, baby.

953
01:23:19,447 --> 01:23:21,039
Hold me.

954
01:23:21,207 --> 01:23:22,686
Hold me.

955
01:23:22,847 --> 01:23:24,246
Hold me.

956
01:23:24,407 --> 01:23:27,922
Come on, let's go, huh?
Let's go, baby.

957
01:23:29,447 --> 01:23:32,359
Come on, my place is just
a few blocks from here.

958
01:23:32,527 --> 01:23:36,918
We'll be there in a jiffy, come on.
Come on, let's go.

959
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:41,046
Come on.

960
01:23:42,487 --> 01:23:43,602
Let go.

961
01:23:44,847 --> 01:23:49,159
- Oh... no.
- What do you mean, no? You want to...

962
01:23:49,327 --> 01:23:50,965
No, I can't!

963
01:23:51,127 --> 01:23:53,083
I can't!

964
01:23:53,247 --> 01:23:57,240
I thought I could.
I was mad at him, but I can't. I can't!

965
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:00,160
Sure you can, honey. Sure you can.

966
01:24:01,367 --> 01:24:03,676
I'm sorry, I can't.

967
01:24:05,567 --> 01:24:09,037
Please take me back to the hotel.

968
01:24:09,207 --> 01:24:11,516
I think I'm going to be sick.

969
01:24:13,047 --> 01:24:14,036
Please.

970
01:24:14,927 --> 01:24:16,724
OK, Julia.

971
01:24:16,887 --> 01:24:18,286
OK.

972
01:24:18,447 --> 01:24:22,326
- Come on, let's get in the car.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

973
01:24:22,487 --> 01:24:26,958
- It's all right. Let's get in the car. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

974
01:25:00,447 --> 01:25:03,439
- Hey, Dan, you want cheese or jelly?
- Anything you got.

975
01:25:03,607 --> 01:25:06,565
Oh, Dan, there's a phone call.
A guy named Hughie.

976
01:25:12,887 --> 01:25:17,039
- Hughie? Dan Madigan.
- Stella's with me now. They're with Benesch.

977
01:25:17,207 --> 01:25:21,041
He sent her down for a bottle of vodka,
and she called me.

978
01:25:21,207 --> 01:25:24,597
- Benesch has still got Doreen.
- Take it easy, Hughie.

979
01:25:24,767 --> 01:25:26,485
Take your time. Where are you?

980
01:25:26,647 --> 01:25:30,720
100 Street and 2nd Avenue.
Two blocks from where he's holed up.

981
01:25:30,887 --> 01:25:33,481
- Where's that?
- East River Hotel. 102nd Street.

982
01:25:33,647 --> 01:25:36,241
His apartment's on the top floor,
facing the alley.

983
01:25:36,407 --> 01:25:39,638
- Stella says he's got six guns.
- All right, Hughie.

984
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:43,277
Don't stay there.
Go across to the Washington Houses.

985
01:25:43,447 --> 01:25:47,201
I'll meet you at the south end.
And hang on to the girl, right?

986
01:25:47,367 --> 01:25:48,800
Yeah, man, yeah.

987
01:25:49,407 --> 01:25:52,285
Your wife called.
I told her you were on the phone.

988
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:56,565
- Thanks.
- She got home OK, and she loves you.

989
01:25:56,727 --> 01:25:58,763
- Jim, we got Benesch located.
- Where?

990
01:25:58,927 --> 01:26:00,406
East River Hotel.

991
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:05,243
We ought to pass the word downtown,
looks like he wants to go all the way.

992
01:26:16,447 --> 01:26:19,996
- This is exactly the way the apartment is?
- Yeah, that's it.

993
01:26:20,167 --> 01:26:23,921
What about my sister?
He said he'd kill her if I don't come back.

994
01:26:24,087 --> 01:26:26,806
We'll take care of him. She won't get hurt.

995
01:26:26,967 --> 01:26:32,360
Here. Take Stella to the movies
till this is all over. Get going. And thanks.

996
01:27:49,367 --> 01:27:51,323
Lieutenant Price, 23rd Squad.

997
01:27:51,487 --> 01:27:54,445
- Where is he?
- Here, I'll show you.

998
01:28:01,607 --> 01:28:03,837
The top floor, last window on the right.

999
01:28:04,007 --> 01:28:05,963
- Did you cover the front?
- Yes, sir.

1000
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:08,197
- Did you evacuate the top floor?
- No, sir.

1001
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:11,325
- Do it now.
- All right, men, go ahead.

1002
01:28:22,207 --> 01:28:24,846
- There's a girl with him?
- That's what they tell me.

1003
01:28:25,007 --> 01:28:27,567
It's gonna make things a little tougher.

1004
01:28:28,487 --> 01:28:31,638
No tear gas or smoke if we can avoid it.

1005
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:41,002
- Here's the layout.
- Good.

1006
01:28:41,167 --> 01:28:42,998
- Who's going in first?
- I am.

1007
01:28:43,167 --> 01:28:46,443
- I go in first. I'm the senior badge.
- By only two days!

1008
01:28:46,607 --> 01:28:50,805
Dan, go in first. Rocky, cover him.
Don't use that shotgun unless you have to.

1009
01:28:50,967 --> 01:28:55,438
I know you have a personal score to settle,
but don't let it make you reckless.

1010
01:28:55,607 --> 01:28:59,646
Good detectives are hard to find.
Good luck. God be with you.

1011
01:28:59,807 --> 01:29:00,922
Thank you, sir.

1012
01:29:09,367 --> 01:29:12,564
To hell with these vests! Let's go.

1013
01:29:26,447 --> 01:29:28,961
Never mind the dog. Get going.

1014
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:36,484
This is the last of them.
We've evacuated the whole floor.

1015
01:29:36,647 --> 01:29:38,205
Come on, pop.

1016
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:51,645
Barney, you haven't got a chance.

1017
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:54,241
Get some sense in your head and come out.

1018
01:29:54,407 --> 01:29:59,435
I still got one of your guns, Danny Boy!
You want it with a Detective's special?

1019
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:02,644
It's all over, Benesch.
Come out or we're coming in.

1020
01:30:02,807 --> 01:30:07,119
What are you waiting for, Bonaro?
You and Madigan lost your nerve?

1021
01:30:13,047 --> 01:30:16,278
Just the lock. There's a girl in there.

1022
01:30:20,927 --> 01:30:25,318
- Dan, cover me and let me go in first.
- Knock it off.

1023
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:27,796
- Keep him talking.
- Right.

1024
01:30:27,967 --> 01:30:32,006
Barney? Barney, send the girl out.
She can't help you.

1025
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:35,716
How do you know? I might get bored!

1026
01:30:35,887 --> 01:30:39,596
Oh, come on, Barney.
She has nothing to do with this.

1027
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:43,806
- Let's talk.
- I'm all through talking with you bums!

1028
01:30:43,967 --> 01:30:47,243
Send me somebody important!
The mayor here yet?

1029
01:30:47,407 --> 01:30:51,116
Sorry, he couldn't make it.
He's busy with the budget.

1030
01:30:52,807 --> 01:30:54,525
You're a funny man, Bonaro!

1031
01:30:54,687 --> 01:30:59,807
You want her alive, come and get her
before I put a bullet in her dumb head!

1032
01:31:10,927 --> 01:31:12,883
[Girl screams]

1033
01:31:21,287 --> 01:31:23,562
I killed him, didn't I, Rocky?

1034
01:31:27,207 --> 01:31:28,401
Dan?

1035
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:29,556
Dan!

1036

Dan...

1037
01:31:36,247 --> 01:31:39,444
I'm... I'm hurt bad, Rock.

1038
01:31:51,367 --> 01:31:55,042
Sergeant, get these people out of here.
Clear the way.

1039
01:31:55,207 --> 01:31:57,516
Get back. You, out!

1040
01:32:04,527 --> 01:32:07,439
- You're gonna be all right, Dan.
- Thanks, Commissioner.

1041
01:32:07,607 --> 01:32:10,679
Save your strength. You'll be at the hospital
in two minutes.

1042
01:32:10,847 --> 01:32:14,203
- I'd like to go with him, Commissioner.
- Go ahead.

1043
01:32:20,247 --> 01:32:23,557
Price, get Mrs Madigan... and a priest.

1044
01:32:38,327 --> 01:32:39,885
Rocky...

1045
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,315
Yeah, Dan?

1046
01:32:42,687 --> 01:32:45,406
Did we get him?

1047
01:32:45,567 --> 01:32:48,684
Yeah, we got him, Dan.

1048
01:32:48,847 --> 01:32:51,441
You're gonna be all right.

1049
01:32:53,847 --> 01:32:55,519
Where's Julia?

1050
01:32:58,647 --> 01:32:59,636
Julia...

1051
01:33:00,807 --> 01:33:03,879
Hey, she's on her way, Dan.

1052
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:08,006
She'll probably be at the hospital
when we get there.

1053
01:33:09,487 --> 01:33:12,320
Too... late.

1054
01:33:48,567 --> 01:33:51,684
Come on, clear them away, huh?

1055
01:33:52,967 --> 01:33:55,435
Let's go, fellas, let's go!

1056
01:33:59,447 --> 01:34:01,483
I'm so very sorry, Mrs Madigan.

1057
01:34:01,647 --> 01:34:05,117
I don't see why, Commissioner.
Just another lousy cop.

1058
01:34:05,287 --> 01:34:08,199
- Are you sorry you killed him?
- Mrs Madigan, please...

1059
01:34:08,367 --> 01:34:09,846
I'll take you home.

1060
01:34:10,007 --> 01:34:12,919
What the hell do you care
about Dan Madigan?

1061
01:34:13,087 --> 01:34:17,842
What do you know about him anyway?
Except he was one of your lousy cops!

1062
01:34:18,007 --> 01:34:21,636
- I am very sorry...
- I don't want your sympathy!

1063
01:34:21,807 --> 01:34:23,399
Julia, Julia...

1064
01:34:23,567 --> 01:34:27,958
You're a self-centred murderer,
and I don't want anything from you.

1065
01:34:30,567 --> 01:34:32,603
Except I want Danny.

1066
01:34:34,287 --> 01:34:36,755
I want my Danny back.

1067
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:47,878
Your car is this way, Commissioner.

1068
01:35:03,887 --> 01:35:06,560
There's never any right thing to say,
is there?

1069
01:35:06,727 --> 01:35:08,206
No, never.

1070
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:12,595
Oh, Charley, about that other thing...

1071
01:35:14,487 --> 01:35:18,400
We'll face Earl Griffen together.
I think it'll work out.

1072
01:35:18,567 --> 01:35:22,242
Anyway, I threw a raid
into Muller's place last night, Tony.

1073
01:35:22,407 --> 01:35:24,796
- We'll see what happens.
- Good.

1074
01:35:24,967 --> 01:35:27,959
- See you downtown in the morning.
- Yeah.

1075
01:35:28,127 --> 01:35:32,439
Oh, Tony.
What are we gonna do about Dr Taylor?

1076
01:35:32,607 --> 01:35:35,724
I don't know, Charley. That's Monday.

1077
01:35:36,305 --> 01:35:42,531
