Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,716
I have...

3
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,382
little time left.

4
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:25,127
I would like to take advantage...

5
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:29,603
of my final breaths...

6
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:31,565
to...

7
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:35,807
to tell you...

8
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:38,268
a story.

9
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:48,045
A very pretty...

10
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:51,719
story.

11
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:10,734
To make love we turned hate around.

12
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:51,842
Hello. It's me.

13
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:56,308
Don't worry, I took care of it.

14
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:58,309
No.

15
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:34,815
It's an old story...

16
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:37,683
that begins with someone leaving.

17
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:41,722
A young woman starts
on a long voyage...

18
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,098
toward reality.

19
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:48,223
- Hi.
- Hello.

20
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,888
Bibi, this'll make you happy.

21
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,995
We've been robbed another 12 dresses.

22
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:03,908
It's time we got someone.

23
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:07,308
Consider it done.

24
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:09,374
I'm calling the agency.

25
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,412
Hi Claire.

26
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:16,488
Hi, it's nice of you to come.

27
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,020
It's OK.

28
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:22,959
I'll take care of you.

29
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:27,427
The abortionist wears
a bullet-proof vest to mow his lawn.

30
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:28,927
Has he got kids?

31
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:31,268
A lot.

32
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:39,537
You've had how many abortions?

33
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:41,648
Two... three.

34
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:46,548
No, Bibi.

35
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:49,287
Don't start feeling guilty.

36
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:53,927
Guilt is useless,
you have to accept it.

37
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,833
- You know Bjorn Magnussen?
- No.

38
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:04,837
He is...
he was a great writer back home.

39
00:07:05,306 --> 00:07:10,209
He wrote "All human actions
are manifestations against death."

40
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,203
It's a very important sentence.

41
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:15,442
A very dangerous sentence.

42
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:19,412
It helps me reconcile
myself with human kind.

43
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,316
Bgnar Magnerson,
a name that smells like snow.

44
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:29,528
Bjorn Magnussen, is snow.

45
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,996
- How did he die?
- Suicide.

46
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:36,464
- You want to sleep over tonight?
- Yes.

47
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:43,405
While in the shower, Bibi
becomes more aware of her body.

48
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:53,914
Paradoxically, she loses touch
with time and the world around her.

49
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:56,583
Your body still thinks you're pregnant.

50
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:02,179
It won't last.

51
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:13,097
Your song last night was pretty.

52
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:15,101
It was gentle.

53
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:19,505
What does it mean?

54
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:23,240
I learned it from my grandmother.

55
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:26,739
Forget the meaning,
but you're right, it's gentle.

56
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:28,848
That song...

57
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:32,815
is all but...

58
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:34,578
gentle.

59
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:39,490
It's a horrible song...

60
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:42,323
It's atrocious.

61
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,493
To be continued...

62
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:54,801
I'm telling you,
it'll be a very beautiful day.

63
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:56,700
Very.

64
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:02,411
You didn't visit mom last week?

65
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,178
No.

66
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:07,113
Mom's fine. And you?

67
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:08,380
I'm fine.

68
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:10,747
You look tired to me.

69
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,482
No, I'm doing very well.

70
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:16,423
Anymore problems with Jakarta?

71
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,096
They like the deal.

72
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:23,534
What's with your supplier in Jakarta.

73
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:30,877
I just told you,
everything's been taken care of.

74
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,702
There's no more fuck ups.

75
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,675
Call them, you'll see.

76
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:36,905
I already did.

77
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:39,209
Mr. Kumsawout is on the line.

78
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:41,917
Mr. Kumsawout.

79
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,120
Good morning, Mr. Champagne.

80
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:47,852
Have you made any arrangements
with Mrs. Champagne...

81
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:50,054
about the next shipment?

82
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:55,195
As you know, I haven't been able
to reach her for 2 months now.

83
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:58,401
Thank you, I'll call you later.
Goodbye.

84
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:02,674
A bit humiliating.

85
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,781
We can't go on this way.
It's over.

86
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,254
Listen...
the carrier's terrible...

87
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,086
the one between Jakarta and Manila,
then there's customs...

88
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:24,755
Customs. Keep going Bibiane,
tell me all about your problems.

89
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,428
You still don't get it, do you?

90
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,535
Anyway, it's too late now.

91
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,031
I've been had, Philippe.

92
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:38,110
I lost the money.

93
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,540
I know.

94
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:43,073
We'll forget you,
and the $200,000 you lost.

95
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:44,912
I'll pay it all back.

96
00:11:45,086 --> 00:11:46,144
No, don't.

97
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:50,123
Forget the money, forget us.
Just disappear.

98
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:53,456
- We'll make the store disappear.
- Where's your boss?

99
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:56,222
We make investments.

100
00:11:57,264 --> 00:12:00,791
Keep your bullshit
for the social workers.

101
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:04,127
That's $69.90.

102
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,068
Excuse me.

103
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,405
Sumatra boutique.

104
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:18,441
It's me. I'm not coming in today.
You'll be OK?

105
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:19,748
Get some rest.

106
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:24,952
Sara, I have to leave.
I've got some things to take care of

107
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:26,323
in Jakarta.

108
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,886
Could you ask Solange
to get me a ticket...

109
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,957
on... the earliest flight possible.

110
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:34,926
I'll see what I can do.

111
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:37,536
Interviewing security guards,
tomorrow?

112
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:39,429
Day after? After, after?

113
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:43,604
After, after, after tomorrow?

114
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:45,177
After tomorrow, OK?

115
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:46,706
Your interview...

116
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:49,739
with Future,
for the young entrepreneur issue.

117
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:53,283
- They really want you. Tomorrow?
- Yes.

118
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:55,486
I'm not seeing anyone, today.

119
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,228
Does it take much gas
to immolate yourself?

120
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:07,796
To where?

121
00:13:08,435 --> 00:13:09,902
To immolate yourself.

122
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:13,002
To immolate yourself.

123
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:14,838
You can't say that.

124
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:16,773
Sure I can.

125
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:19,003
No. Thirty dollars, please.

126
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,646
To immolate is to sacrifice.

127
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:24,342
What you want is to suicide,
that's different.

128
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:26,084
Thanks.

129
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:48,236
No, don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

130
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,734
- No.
- Come over to my place.

131
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:22,565
You haven't moved?

132
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,873
Because my car is parked
in front of your place.

133
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,830
He who has killed, will be killed.

134
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:58,458
I'm not working today.
I don't feel so good.

135
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:00,259
Someone's here for you.

136
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,628
Someone?

137
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:08,472
Bibiane,
Marie-Jeanne Sirois from Future.

138
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,506
Can we start, we're late.

139
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,273
- Does the tape recorder bother you?
- No.

140
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:20,982
Here's the usual question:

141
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:26,250
Is it a burden being
Florence Faber's daughter?

142
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:30,329
I mean, genetically wise,
people must expect a lot from you.

143
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:32,292
Not really.

144
00:22:32,332 --> 00:22:35,927
Being F.F.'s daughter gives
you quite a head start.

145
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:37,334
No, not really.

146
00:22:38,872 --> 00:22:41,136
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

147
00:22:45,545 --> 00:22:48,207
You're head
of the 3 Sumatra Boutiques.

148
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:52,184
Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec.
That's extraordinary at 25.

149
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:54,718
So business... is going well?

150
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:56,618
Business is great.

151
00:22:57,457 --> 00:22:59,254
According to Boston U.,

152
00:22:59,393 --> 00:23:04,092
business, is an extension of man's
insatiable need to reproduce.

153
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:07,297
There's a link between
male masturbation

154
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:10,494
and how most of today's
business deals are made.

155
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:16,207
The pitch, for example, is a purely
male form of sexual arousal.

156
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,504
Everything is sex related,
we all know that.

157
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:23,910
What about you, sexually speaking?

158
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,347
We talking ass or business?

159
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:27,278
Ass.

160
00:23:27,954 --> 00:23:29,979
I've nothing new to add about ass.

161
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:35,191
You have your mother's skin.

162
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,728
Some day, I'll have her skin.

163
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,735
I don't know how you feel now,

164
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:51,708
but I'd like you to do it
as slowly as possible.

165
00:23:54,414 --> 00:23:58,180
I want you to transform...
but slowly.

166
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:02,280
Very slowly, gently.

167
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:05,723
Let her come out...

168
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:08,890
let your mother out.

169
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:12,963
I want you to become transparent.

170
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:17,836
Now I don't want to see you anymore.

171
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:38,347
Being the child of a myth,

172
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:41,717
transformed her into a mythomaniac.

173
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,328
She was born from such a strong figure,

174
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,503
that it created a large gap in her.

175
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:25,409
Hi... it's me.

176
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:28,117
Hello!

177
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:30,014
Hi.

178
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,088
How are you?

179
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:33,351
Very, very, very well.

180
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:36,318
Wait, I'll be right back.

181
00:28:36,896 --> 00:28:40,297
This morning I had
a flash of inspiration.

182
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,299
A revelation, I think I found the key
to my thesis, it's revolutionary.

183
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:47,730
I don't know where to begin.

184
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:49,540
What are we doing?

185
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:51,401
Where are my keys?

186
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:55,904
No wonder they've kept going
in circles for years, in my field.

187
00:28:56,216 --> 00:29:00,585
First, they can't even agree
on a basic neutral vocabulary.

188
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:06,923
Second, they work with a totally outdated
epistemological model, it's as if...

189
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:11,157
You're right...

190
00:29:11,765 --> 00:29:13,392
It stinks of fish.

191
00:29:34,988 --> 00:29:37,218
You'll note, I didn't ask anything.

192
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:43,353
Are we a better friend when we ask
questions or when we don't?

193
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,188
Here's the key.

194
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:46,923
- It's new.
- It's clean?

195
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:48,427
Clean, all over.

196
00:29:48,668 --> 00:29:50,659
- All over?
- All over.

197
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:56,603
No, I can't, I just can't.

198
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:11,786
Fuck, it still stinks!

199
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:17,823
Well it's not the car body.

200
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:21,030
Hey, relax, OK? Relax.

201
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:35,408
You don't forget it,
you de-dramatize it.

202
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:40,679
You're going to de-dramatize it.
You'll deny it's importance.

203
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:42,785
It's a slow process.

204
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:47,121
Believe me,
I've been through it 3 times.

205
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:32,895
I shouldn't stay alone.

206
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,718
You're putting it on inside out.

207
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:52,603
Gently... gently...

208
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:55,374
Was it good?

209
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,110
Did it do you good?

210
00:34:59,245 --> 00:34:59,734
Wasn't good?

211
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:04,380
You should've waited a week.

212
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:07,649
I was hoping it would have...

213
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:10,347
a homeopathic effect on your mood.

214
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:13,756
Two octopus?

215
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:16,627
- Like usual.
- Like usual.

216
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,392
The octopus is tough.

217
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:25,935
Don't eat it!

218
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:29,131
You'll get nightmares
from eating stale octopus.

219
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:31,576
Is everything OK?

220
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:34,172
The octopus is tough.

221
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,744
- Pardon me?
- Taste it yourself.

222
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,814
It won't stay the course.

223
00:35:39,018 --> 00:35:40,952
Let me change it right away.

224
00:35:43,656 --> 00:35:44,645
Times change...

225
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:47,282
times change.

226
00:37:43,676 --> 00:37:44,608
I'm sorry.

227
00:37:44,744 --> 00:37:46,803
Sorry, I can't let you in.

228
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:48,004
What's the problem?

229
00:37:48,147 --> 00:37:50,672
Sorry. Boss's orders,
you must leave.

230
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,742
What are you doing here?

231
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:54,345
I'm sorry.

232
00:37:58,724 --> 00:38:00,453
Please, get out.

233
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:04,557
- The boss?
- Yes, now, please leave.

234
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,398
Mr. Champagne,
your sister's on line 3.

235
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:17,197
OK, I'll take it.

236
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,408
Hi Philippe. Philippe...

237
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:22,874
Never mind.

238
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:15,995
The Norwegian fishermen
use musical waves...

239
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:17,960
for a net.

240
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,072
It's by this tune of Grieg's,
that I was caught.

241
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:05,075
Struck by a car in his kitchen!

242
00:40:05,217 --> 00:40:07,208
Originally from Norway,

243
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:11,187
the victim was found
sitting at his kitchen table.

244
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,007
Excuse me sir,

245
00:40:36,715 --> 00:40:38,410
what time is it?

246
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:40,446
Midnight.

247
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:49,424
Can I ask you a question?

248
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:59,394
I killed someone by... accident.

249
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:05,634
Nobody knows, except me.

250
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:08,443
Nobody?

251
00:41:09,748 --> 00:41:10,840
No, nobody.

252
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,714
So what's the problem?

253
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:15,914
I didn't hear a thing.

254
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,320
No, what I mean...

255
00:41:25,664 --> 00:41:27,188
In your opinion,

256
00:41:29,802 --> 00:41:32,066
should I turn myself in?

257
00:41:33,873 --> 00:41:35,340
He's dead.

258
00:41:35,774 --> 00:41:39,733
If he's dead, what does it change?
It changes nothing.

259
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:42,646
An accident's an accident.

260
00:41:43,983 --> 00:41:47,680
Anyway, you too are going to die
one day or another.

261
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:53,251
If I were you,
I'd keep my mouth shut.

262
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:55,219
Good night.

263
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:57,320
Good night.

264
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:43,962
Life gives her a second chance.

265
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,261
If she survives,

266
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:49,299
she will give
herself the right to live.

267
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,678
Thank you, my good man.

268
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:16,821
Now, where was I? Ah, yes!

269
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,217
Did it do you good?

270
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:22,186
It wasn't good?

271
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:26,829
You should've waited a week.

272
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:29,825
I was hoping it would have...

273
00:46:29,868 --> 00:46:32,598
a homeopathic effect on your mood.

274
00:46:34,907 --> 00:46:36,033
Two octopus.

275
00:46:36,742 --> 00:46:38,903
- Like usual.
- Like usual.

276
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:46,146
The octopus is tough.

277
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:51,253
Is everything OK?

278
00:46:51,423 --> 00:46:53,550
The octopus is tough.

279
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:54,952
Pardon me?

280
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:57,957
Taste it. It won't stay the course.

281
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,927
I'll change it right away.

282
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:29,116
Belinda, come here.

283
00:47:31,663 --> 00:47:34,097
I don't understand.
What's he saying?

284
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:38,531
He's very mad.

285
00:47:39,538 --> 00:47:44,532
He says, "What's wrong with
the octopus? It's like cement!"

286
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:48,436
I have the best quality octopus!

287
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,481
If you're not happy,
go fish them yourself!

288
00:47:59,157 --> 00:48:04,185
Can someone here tell me what's
going on with the damn octopus?

289
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:06,928
Who went to get them this morning?

290
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,091
I went to get them.

291
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:12,360
Head usually gets them,

292
00:48:13,171 --> 00:48:14,968
he always chooses them.

293
00:48:15,107 --> 00:48:17,200
- I know.
- He hasn't been in.

294
00:48:17,442 --> 00:48:21,435
I tried calling him a few times.
Nobody answers.

295
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,644
He might be sick.

296
00:48:24,182 --> 00:48:25,706
I'll go and get him.

297
00:48:27,452 --> 00:48:31,354
I don't know, Miguel came
3 or 4 times already...

298
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,022
We're afraid something happened.

299
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:04,141
Be careful.

300
00:50:05,217 --> 00:50:06,946
Pull on the collar.

301
00:50:07,152 --> 00:50:09,143
OK, we can take the mask off.

302
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,118
Are you OK?

303
00:50:21,033 --> 00:50:23,695
- Is it untied?
- Yes, you can go.

304
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:28,662
Feels good to get out.

305
00:50:28,907 --> 00:50:30,898
- Everything fine?
- Looks like it.

306
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,920
It's him.

307
00:51:57,529 --> 00:51:59,997
Who decided to cremate him?

308
00:52:00,132 --> 00:52:01,565
Good question.

309
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:04,026
He wasn't supposed to be cremated.

310
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,394
Oh no?

311
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:07,868
Oops!

312
00:52:08,406 --> 00:52:12,604
Our condolences.
Do you need a bag?

313
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:27,015
You sure you don't want me
to improvise a little ceremony?

314
00:52:28,193 --> 00:52:30,093
I'm sure he'd like it.

315
00:52:31,163 --> 00:52:32,460
No, thank you.

316
00:52:33,532 --> 00:52:35,159
That's very kind of you.

317
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,825
My father only believed
in what he saw.

318
00:52:38,136 --> 00:52:39,797
Well, now he sees God.

319
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:43,974
Einstein Karsan.

320
00:52:44,242 --> 00:52:47,234
- Could you please speak up?
- Einstein Karsen.

321
00:52:47,846 --> 00:52:49,108
Could you spell it?

322
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:51,772
A-n-n-s-t-e-i-n, Carson with a C...

323
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:55,284
Excuse me, it's Annstein Karson.
It's with a K.

324
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:49,455
FUTURE

325
00:55:50,528 --> 00:55:52,928
Bibiane, Flo Fabert's daughter.

326
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:41,033
Obituaries, prayers, thank yous.

327
00:56:55,193 --> 00:56:56,717
No, thank you.

328
00:56:58,296 --> 00:57:00,457
That's nice, thank you. But...

329
00:57:01,866 --> 00:57:03,356
my father believed only...

330
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:06,299
Excuse me, I'd like to see
Annstein Carson, please.

331
00:57:06,638 --> 00:57:09,198
- Who?
- Annstein Carson.

332
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:11,433
Could you spell that?

333
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:14,874
A-n-n-s-t-e-i-n,

334
00:57:15,914 --> 00:57:18,439
C-a-r-s-o-n.

335
00:57:19,484 --> 00:57:21,884
It's Annstein Karson with a K.

336
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:26,820
I'm his neighbour, we'd say hi,
when we'd cross on the street.

337
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:29,320
I thought he was all alone so...

338
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:31,560
I came over here...

339
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:33,564
to say hi one last time.

340
00:57:34,165 --> 00:57:36,725
I didn't know he had a son.
Had I known...

341
00:57:37,135 --> 00:57:38,500
I shouldn't be here.

342
00:57:38,636 --> 00:57:40,661
I didn't know he had a neighbour.

343
00:57:41,439 --> 00:57:44,499
He lived inside his head,
neighbours're rare there.

344
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:46,933
Know him long?

345
00:57:47,846 --> 00:57:48,835
No.

346
00:57:49,614 --> 00:57:50,410
Not really.

347
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:56,009
Where can I get a tooth brush?

348
00:57:58,256 --> 00:57:59,883
A tooth brush?

349
00:58:00,592 --> 00:58:02,560
There's a drugstore over there.

350
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,354
Do you know where I can get a coffee?

351
00:58:06,464 --> 00:58:09,729
Right next to the drugstore.

352
00:58:10,602 --> 00:58:13,002
- Do you want to have a coffee with me?
- No...

353
00:58:14,706 --> 00:58:16,037
I can't, I'm sorry.

354
00:58:16,207 --> 00:58:17,299
I understand.

355
00:58:17,642 --> 00:58:20,236
A coffee by yourself is quite boring.

356
00:58:20,445 --> 00:58:23,437
In fact, it's really... very boring.

357
00:58:26,184 --> 00:58:27,310
For my father?

358
00:58:30,855 --> 00:58:31,981
How can I say no?

359
00:58:32,524 --> 00:58:34,151
I don't know anyone here.

360
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:40,553
How did he die?

361
00:58:40,899 --> 00:58:41,695
You don't know?

362
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,292
He was poisoned.

363
00:58:43,568 --> 00:58:47,299
My father remarried
a somewhat jealous, Haitian lady.

364
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:50,367
When he left, she put a curse on him.

365
00:58:50,508 --> 00:58:52,271
She was in a voodoo gang.

366
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,970
I could've dug him up,
and he'd be a zombie.

367
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:57,873
But the idiots cremated him.

368
00:59:01,286 --> 00:59:02,275
Thanks.

369
00:59:05,823 --> 00:59:06,812
Thank you.

370
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:11,786
No, he got hit by a car.

371
00:59:13,164 --> 00:59:14,358
I thought so.

372
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,867
What do you do?

373
00:59:18,036 --> 00:59:20,231
- I'm a flight attendant.
- Really?

374
00:59:20,371 --> 00:59:21,497
What airline?

375
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,133
It depends, it varies...

376
00:59:26,144 --> 00:59:27,168
Staying long?

377
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:32,041
No, I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

378
00:59:32,216 --> 00:59:35,447
I've a favour to ask.
It's my father's things...

379
00:59:37,488 --> 00:59:40,184
I'm... I'm already late,
I'm sorry.

380
00:59:49,534 --> 00:59:51,126
Thanks for the coffee.

381
00:59:55,406 --> 00:59:56,395
You're tough.

382
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:34,007
I have to see my father's co-workers.
It won't take long.

383
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:36,399
I wish that your father's killer...

384
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:40,571
dies of a slow and atrocious death.

385
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:47,740
I wish that the killer dies
in the most cruel solitude.

386
01:01:52,523 --> 01:01:55,458
I wish that he dies disembowelled,

387
01:01:55,693 --> 01:01:56,921
devoured by dogs.

388
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:05,593
If I catch him, I kill him.

389
01:02:36,968 --> 01:02:38,128
He'll die,

390
01:02:38,703 --> 01:02:41,035
that's all that's written.

391
01:02:50,348 --> 01:02:52,111
That was a stiff drink.

392
01:02:53,384 --> 01:02:54,783
Yeah, quite.

393
01:03:17,074 --> 01:03:20,566
Well that's it.
That represents a whole life.

394
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,411
Now I have to...

395
01:03:24,749 --> 01:03:27,081
sort it all out before the morning.

396
01:03:27,518 --> 01:03:29,543
I can't open them alone.

397
01:03:34,392 --> 01:03:35,620
Don't worry.

398
01:04:27,612 --> 01:04:29,102
It still works.

399
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:32,543
Garbage.

400
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:54,328
I'll keep that.

401
01:04:58,743 --> 01:05:00,176
The ring.

402
01:05:02,113 --> 01:05:03,375
That.

403
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:05,106
This.

404
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:11,420
Here.

405
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,651
For you, to protect you from the cold...

406
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:16,883
and other stuff like voodoo.

407
01:05:20,164 --> 01:05:21,426
Thank you.

408
01:05:24,669 --> 01:05:26,193
What time's your flight?

409
01:05:26,337 --> 01:05:29,670
I don't know what to do
about my father.

410
01:05:30,808 --> 01:05:31,968
And your mother?

411
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:33,508
She died when I was 3.

412
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:35,310
She drowned.

413
01:05:36,447 --> 01:05:39,109
My father never set foot
on a boat again.

414
01:05:39,483 --> 01:05:42,850
He wanted to be buried at sea,
with my mother, but now...

415
01:05:43,254 --> 01:05:44,721
he's only powder, so...

416
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:47,423
You can still do it.

417
01:05:48,326 --> 01:05:52,626
It's just that...
a sailor is... it's whole.

418
01:05:52,863 --> 01:05:56,629
I can't dust the waves,
it's not like him either.

419
01:05:56,934 --> 01:06:00,335
I'm afraid...
it'll look a little stupid.

420
01:06:00,738 --> 01:06:02,035
No.

421
01:06:05,576 --> 01:06:07,635
You speak Norwegian?

422
01:06:07,878 --> 01:06:09,368
It's been a while.

423
01:06:09,513 --> 01:06:10,673
Listen.

424
01:06:18,356 --> 01:06:19,823
Yes... it goes...

425
01:06:22,426 --> 01:06:23,893
And then it's...

426
01:06:25,129 --> 01:06:26,756
What does it mean?

427
01:06:26,931 --> 01:06:32,927
Rip their heads off, empty their skulls,
drink from the skulls of our enemies.

428
01:06:33,471 --> 01:06:35,268
Then it talks about
opening up the belly,

429
01:06:35,406 --> 01:06:38,068
eating the liver alive. It's folklore.

430
01:07:01,565 --> 01:07:03,556
- We didn't get much sleep.
- No.

431
01:07:04,335 --> 01:07:06,599
You'll sleep on the plane.

432
01:07:06,637 --> 01:07:09,003
Thank you very much.

433
01:07:10,174 --> 01:07:11,539
You're nice.

434
01:07:17,214 --> 01:07:19,045
I'll think about you a lot.

435
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:23,580
I know.

436
01:07:59,056 --> 01:08:00,045
I forgot to say...

437
01:08:05,196 --> 01:08:07,130
I wanted to make love with you.

438
01:08:15,005 --> 01:08:16,563
That's my table, my chairs.

439
01:08:16,707 --> 01:08:18,937
That's a picture of my best friend.

440
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:22,240
That's my fridge, my stove,

441
01:08:22,513 --> 01:08:24,504
my plates, my glasses,

442
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,017
my carpet.

443
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,119
That's my bed, my sheets...

444
01:08:31,856 --> 01:08:33,346
my clothes...

445
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,487
that's a couch, windows...
that's my home.

446
01:09:10,794 --> 01:09:12,352
You're a frogman.

447
01:09:12,963 --> 01:09:14,931
And you're not a flight attendant.

448
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:18,733
You're not my father's neighbour, either.

449
01:09:24,675 --> 01:09:26,905
I'm not your father's neighbour.

450
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:31,109
I love you.

451
01:09:33,884 --> 01:09:35,977
Frogmen are quick.

452
01:09:36,487 --> 01:09:39,615
A frogman has to make
very quick decisions.

453
01:09:41,392 --> 01:09:42,620
I love you.

454
01:09:47,932 --> 01:09:49,456
You don't know me.

455
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:52,332
I know you a lot.

456
01:09:54,305 --> 01:09:56,569
And what I know, I find beautiful.

457
01:12:00,597 --> 01:12:02,030
You're an angel.

458
01:12:15,946 --> 01:12:17,971
Plane crash in Baie-Comeau:
No survivors.

459
01:12:28,992 --> 01:12:30,254
Don't say that.

460
01:12:38,335 --> 01:12:39,563
Don't say that.

461
01:12:57,521 --> 01:12:58,852
Don't say that.

462
01:14:50,334 --> 01:14:51,824
To your health, dad.

463
01:15:00,177 --> 01:15:01,474
What do I do?

464
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:05,045
I'm in love with the woman
who killed my father.

465
01:15:07,518 --> 01:15:10,578
She wants me to kill her.
She wants to be punished.

466
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:12,751
Who knows about it?

467
01:15:13,423 --> 01:15:15,584
Nobody else but me.

468
01:15:15,926 --> 01:15:17,757
So what's the problem?

469
01:15:20,931 --> 01:15:23,024
You love her, she wants to die.

470
01:15:23,267 --> 01:15:25,929
Sounds compatible.
Marry her and keep quiet...

471
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:28,333
especially in a bar.

472
01:15:30,874 --> 01:15:32,466
Thanks for the drink.

473
01:15:33,076 --> 01:15:34,236
Good night.

474
01:15:37,814 --> 01:15:38,940
Thanks.

475
01:16:23,327 --> 01:16:26,319
It's all the same in the end, dad...

476
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:32,559
It's all the same.

477
01:18:54,411 --> 01:18:58,370
A few weeks later,
off the shores of Lofoten Islands.

478
01:21:12,482 --> 01:21:15,974
All that's left for me to do,
is to reveal to you,

479
01:21:16,286 --> 01:21:19,778
the great secret of your existence.

480
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:21,981
You are all...

481
01:21:22,305 --> 01:21:28,329
