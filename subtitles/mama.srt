Once Upon A Time...

3
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:33,266
<i>There's one word to describe
what's happening,</i>

4
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,934
<i>And that word is "Panic"</i>

5
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:40,132
<i>And of course this comes with unthinkable
irrational behaviour,</i>

6
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,797
<i>The crash of 29,
</i>

7
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:43,684
<i>...1987 Black Monday...</i>

8
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:46,186
<i>...Came with tragic suicides and murders.</i>

9
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:48,685
<i>This collapse is no exception.</i>

10
00:00:48,686 --> 00:00:51,690
<i>Just one hour ago
as the market were opening,</i>

11
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:54,432
<i>2 partners at Cava Holding were shot...</i>

12
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,241
<i>...at the troubled company's headquarters.</i>

13
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:59,598
<i>Senior partner, Laura Muller,
died on site.</i>

14
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:02,990
<i>An analyst, Albert Bernard,
is in critical condition.</i>

15
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:06,015
<i>Jeffrey Dosage, also Senior partner,
was in the office...</i>

16
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:09,501
<i>...at the time of the shooting
and is now gone missing.</i>

17
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:33,454
I'm sorry, we, we got to go, sweetheart.

18
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:37,117
That's it.

19
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,388
Isn't Mommy taking me to school?

20
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,613
Mommy's not feeling well.

21
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,532
Hurry. Put on your glasses. Come on.

22
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:50,348
Let's go.

23
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,156
Daddy, where're we going?

24
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,438
I don't know.

25
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:36,310
Fuck.

26
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,777
You're driving too fast.

27
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:56,793
- Daddy, you're driving too...
- Shut up!

28
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,751
Sorry, excuse me.

29
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:29,592
- Hey, buddy, you want to get behind the tape?
- I'm family. I'm Lucas Desange.

30
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:32,289
You called me. Someone called me.
Detective or something?

31
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,239
- You live here?
- No, my brother lives here.

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,784
What's going on?
Where is Jeff?

33
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:40,163
Are the girls okay?
Where are the girls?

34
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:42,765
Sir, just hang on, all right?
Just wait here.

35
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:44,550
Jesus Christ.

36
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:54,754
<i>Jeffrey Dosage apparently
shot 2 of his partners to death</i>

37
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:57,617
<i>...before going on to murder his estranged wife.</i>

38
00:03:57,618 --> 00:04:01,162
<i>And kidnapped his two daughters,
age three and one.</i>

39
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,155
It's okay. It's okay.
Come on.

40
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:14,171
Daddy, are we there yet?

41
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,884
My glasses are broken.

42
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,971
What is it?

43
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:36,868
It's okay.

44
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,076
Helvetia

45
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:11,182
- It's all right, come here.
- There's someone inside.

46
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:12,483
Now!

47
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:51,095
Come on, come on..

48
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:36,557
Daddy, there's a woman outside.

49
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:42,428
She's not touching the floor.

50
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:11,136
Why are you crying?

51
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,530
Because I'm sad, honey.

52
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:16,053
Why are you sad?

53
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:18,191
You know,

54
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:21,275
Mom and Dad, they...

55
00:07:22,294 --> 00:07:24,724
...tried real hard.

56
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,823
But sometimes
they messed things up.

57
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,279
You know Daddy loves you, right?

58
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,202
I can't see.

59
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:43,630
What's that?

60
00:07:57,873 --> 00:07:59,702
Look honey, there..

61
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:26,227
Daddy?

62
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:30,697
Daddy?

63
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,805
Daddy?

64
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:43,812
Daddy?

65
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:20,918
Look, Lilly. A cherry.

66
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:57,406
Five Years Later.

67
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,150
Burnsie, where are you guys, then?

68
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,451
Well...

69
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:13,111
We're going to to have a another
look around sector  1-7-12-33.

70
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,577
- That's the mountain road, right?
- Uhuh.

71
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:17,354
Gas station,

72
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:19,687
Road to the Paulson Pass..

73
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,735
<i>- This is good.
- Oh, God. I hate to do this.</i>

74
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:24,036
<i>Do what?</i>

75
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:26,681
The last payment didn't clear.

76
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,095
<i>Well, uh...
I'll check on that.</i>

77
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:32,759
<i>Don't worry about that. Things go down.</i>

78
00:12:33,978 --> 00:12:36,160
<i>All right. I'll work on that
and get back to you.</i>

79
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:37,483
"Not Pregnant"

80
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:39,207
<i>Thank you, good bye.</i>

81
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:43,879
Thank you, God.
Sweet!

82
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,627
- That was Burnside on the phone?
- Yup.

83
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:48,687
What is his next move?

84
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:53,101
Is he going to search sector lousy alpha?

85
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:57,363
Hey, guess who's not pregnant?

86
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,881
What is wrong with you?

87
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:05,901
Last payment didn't clear.

88
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:12,335
Is there a problem with the bank, or...

89
00:13:12,336 --> 00:13:13,736
The money's gone.

90
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:17,708
- I pick B.
- That is the correct answer.

91
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,410
Look, babe..

92
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:26,394
It's your brother. You want to spend all
your money, and find them,

93
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:28,768
It's okay with me.
It's cheaper than therapy.

94
00:13:29,297 --> 00:13:31,534
- And so am I.
- What..?

95
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:45,884
I need to go.

96
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:02,844
- Burnside!
- What?

97
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,342
Hey, Burnside!

98
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:07,286
Jesus Christ!

99
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,947
- You're going to call him?
- Just give me a minute.

100
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,717
But we should call, we said we'd call.

101
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:20,138
Ronny,

102
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,797
Shut up.

103
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,527
Just for one minute.

104
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:33,883
Here you go, Bird.
Take a whiff of that.

105
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:12,318
Hello?

106
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,262
Ah, yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir.

107
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,591
It's cherry pits.

108
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:30,966
Hey, Burnsie!

109
00:16:59,491 --> 00:17:00,791
Burnsie,

110
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:03,198
Can we call him now?

111
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,223
They found them.

112
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:32,392
- You shitting me.
- They found the girls.

113
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,061
Alive.

114
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,844
Dr. Gerald Defuses.

115
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,123
- And you must be Annabel.
- I must be.

116
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,473
- Lucas.
- How are they?

117
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:51,825
Well, just let me warn you.
This won't be easy.

118
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:56,391
We're very fortunate,
that Victoria was old enough...

119
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:58,539
...to retain much of her vocabulary.

120
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,585
But it's still too early to determine...

121
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:02,702
- ...if this development...
- What about the other one?

122
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,549
That's a different story.

123
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:19,763
Shit.

124
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,373
Oh, yeah.

125
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,000
Hey, Victoria.

126
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:48,102
Is that you, Lilly?
Hey...

127
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:53,322
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's okay.

128
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,160
I'm not going to hurt you.

129
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,301
It's okay. It's okay.

130
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,218
I brought something for you.
For your eyes.

131
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:17,649
When you were a little girl.
You had a pair of these. You remember?

132
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,285
I was going to put...
That's okay.

133
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:24,534
Just going to put them here.

134
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:33,444
It's okay.

135
00:19:40,754 --> 00:19:42,054
Yeah.

136
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:47,166
That's it.

137
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:09,643
Daddy?

138
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,010
Oh, no, no, honey.

139
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:18,496
Honey, no, I'm not your Daddy.
I'm...

140
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:21,184
I'm your Daddy's brother.

141
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:23,663
Remember Uncle Luke?

142
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:32,192
Dad?

143
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,134
It's okay.

144
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,749
- Dad?
- It's okay.

145
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:57,864
Dr. Gerald Defuses, Your Honour.

146
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:00,326
The girls have been in my care at the Institute.

147
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,366
Since they were found 87 days ago.

148
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,958
And how would you define their progress?

149
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,595
Solid, and outstandingly fast.

150
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:10,660
If I may?

151
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,910
<i>Your Honour, Victoria and Lilly Dosage...</i>

152
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:19,428
<i>...were found in deplorable conditions.</i>

153
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:21,530
<i>Isolated, starved.</i>

154
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:25,222
<i>They feared and distrusted all physical contact.</i>

155
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:28,333
<i>Their emotional growth was
clearly compromised...</i>

156
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,034
<i>...by their abandonment.</i>

157
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:33,001
<i>In order to survive such extreme isolation,</i>

158
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:35,990
<i>The girls created an imaginary guardian.</i>

159
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:38,318
A parent figure, to feed them,

160
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,268
Sing to them, protect them.

161
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:43,556
They called her: "Mama".

162
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,615
Victoria and Lilly have a real chance...

163
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:50,461
...to have a normal life, though.
With the right care,

164
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:52,634
Physical emotional development.

165
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,589
And much needed love and affection.

166
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:57,669
- They'll get better.
- Thank you, Dr. Defuses.

167
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,141
Ms. Podolski. Would you care
to address the Court?

168
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:02,514
Good morning, Your Honour.

169
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:04,576
Jeffrey Desange murdered my niece.

170
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:06,942
And abandoned his daughters in the forest.

171
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:09,666
And now his brother did an extraordinary thing.

172
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,023
Lucas never gave up on his nieces.

173
00:22:12,024 --> 00:22:14,783
But he did it for the girls. Not for himself.

174
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,596
So, if he still has their best interest at heart,

175
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:20,514
He must know neither his salary,
nor his very small apartment...

176
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:22,679
...are suitable for the raising of 2 children.

177
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,153
Let alone, 2 children with a very special needs.

178
00:22:25,154 --> 00:22:28,447
- How many kid did you raise, Jean?
- Not as many as you, Lucas.

179
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:32,973
Of cause she wants the girls, Lucas.
Stand on her shoes first.

180
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:36,863
She can't just sweep in, and take them.
They are not hers to take.

181
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:39,734
- I'm sure that's not entirely fair.
- I'll tell you, what's not fair :

182
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:42,293
It's not fair is she gets to buy my nieces.

183
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,060
- Is that really such a bad thing?
- What?

184
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:48,709
Annabel plays in the band.

185
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,742
You draw pictures for a living.

186
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:54,472
Where do you live? Do you have room
for children in your life?

187
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,267
I mean, really.

188
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:58,403
What are you saying, Gerald?

189
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:02,081
When it comes to the girls' welfare..

190
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:05,751
Family Court judge is pretty much
oblige to act on my recommendation.

191
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,052
And right now,

192
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:10,784
I'll be lying if I didn't say
it was a slam dunk for Ms. Podolski.

193
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:14,112
But the truth is...

194
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:17,818
I don't want them living on the other
side of the country anymore than you do.

195
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:19,776
So...

196
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:23,361
We can really really help each other out right now.

197
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,642
You want the girls,
I need continued access to them.

198
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,780
What are we going to do?

199
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:40,480
This house, courtesy of the Institute,
is used for case studies.

200
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:41,884
Rent-free.

201
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:45,036
You move to the house, you get the girls.

202
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,006
This is a joke, right?

203
00:23:53,592 --> 00:23:56,060
<i>Mr. Desange, is your brother still alive?</i>

204
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:01,004
Oh, son of a bitch.

205
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,484
- Look, Jean..
- No.

206
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,332
I just want to see them.
That's all.

207
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,701
You'll see them. I mean, you've got
visitation, right? We respect that.

208
00:24:10,702 --> 00:24:13,852
Right now, we need a little space.

209
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:17,312
Just work on this thing for a while.
Find their feet.

210
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:22,098
- Okay?
- Excuse me.

211
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:24,287
<i>October the 26th.</i>

212
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:26,262
<i>Although she seems collaborative,</i>

213
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:29,118
<i>And is quickly recovering her language skills.</i>

214
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,083
<i>Victoria maybe repressing the memory...</i>

215
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:34,277
<i>...of her experience in the wilderness.</i>

216
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:37,231
Okay, Victoria.

217
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,670
Are you nice and relax?

218
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:42,301
Are you feeling sleepy?

219
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,271
I want you to tell me the story again.

220
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:49,432
Can you tell me the story?

221
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,913
It was long time ago,

222
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:58,141
A lady run away
from hospital for sad people.

223
00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:01,601
She took her baby.

224
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,104
She jumped into the water.

225
00:25:05,282 --> 00:25:07,865
How could you know that story, Victoria?

226
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:11,002
Did Mama tell you that story?

227
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:13,919
- She showed me.
- How?

228
00:25:14,977 --> 00:25:16,533
In a dream.

229
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:19,113
Go on, Victoria.

230
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:30,321
And you can't tell anyone
where you are?

231
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:32,043
Nope.

232
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:34,206
That's just bizarre, dude.

233
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:36,206
Yeah, well. For the girls.

234
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:37,707
Few breaths away.

235
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,453
So much deplorable.

236
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:42,300
All families are the messed up.

237
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:45,011
Yeah, but this one messed up,
and it ends it.

238
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:50,506
I don't even have the chance
to screw them up. They came that way.

239
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,852
- Leave him.
- I can't.

240
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,513
You don't sign up for this, babe.

241
00:25:57,602 --> 00:25:59,302
I can't do that to him.

242
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:01,409
Mrs. Sensitivity,

243
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,638
You are in a rock band.

244
00:26:05,257 --> 00:26:07,471
I was in a rock band, yeah.

245
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:52,503
Hey, girls.

246
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:57,988
Hey.

247
00:26:58,629 --> 00:26:59,929
Come here.

248
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,593
Mama.

249
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:04,512
No, don't call me that. I'm not your Mom.

250
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:06,764
I'm Annabel. You can call me that.

251
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,753
Or Annie, or whatever you like.

252
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,734
We could...
We could work it out together, right?

253
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:21,655
Mama.

254
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:01,727
Handsome?

255
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:29,374
CLIFTON FORGE
PUBLIC RECORDS.

256
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:38,235
There are no police reports
between 2008 and 2012...

257
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:40,541
...that match the patient's story.

258
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:42,597
And Doctor, there are no psychiatric hospitals...

259
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:44,844
...anywhere near Clifton Forge.

260
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:47,534
Where were the closest one would be?

261
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,140
Falls Church, 200 miles from here.

262
00:29:52,143 --> 00:29:56,805
Now this log book, contains records
from St. Kerch’s asylum.

263
00:29:56,806 --> 00:30:00,189
Abided to Salt Lake.
That's 5 miles north from here.

264
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,884
But you told me that there are no
mental hospitals in the area.

265
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:09,053
There aren't.
St. Kerch is shut down in 1878.

266
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,603
Page 31.
Patient Edith Brennan.

267
00:31:29,682 --> 00:31:31,911
- Annabel?
- Yup?

268
00:31:31,912 --> 00:31:35,416
- Handsome is outside.
- Try to put him there.

269
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:37,618
But he's crying.

270
00:31:43,823 --> 00:31:45,123
Awesome.

271
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:05,112
There's no way these kids
are ready for this.

272
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:08,215
I know it's tough. It'll get better. I promise.

273
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:10,270
I don't know if I can do this, Luc.

274
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:12,220
I love you, girl.

275
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:38,980
- Someone's here!
- What?

276
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:42,627
Victoria, Lilly?

277
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:29,574
- No one's here.
- Someone's here. I saw them.

278
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,496
- Wow, wow, honey, honey.
- I saw them.

279
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:33,969
Give me the hammer.

280
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,901
I'll check downstairs.
You look after the girls.

281
00:35:48,994 --> 00:35:50,338
Lucas?

282
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:53,542
Oh my God.

283
00:35:55,095 --> 00:35:57,636
<i>- Lucas?
- Hi, it's Vince with Slap Chop.</i>

284
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:05,196
Chop, chop. Chop, cop.

285
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:16,088
I'm really sorry, Annabel.

286
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:21,359
But they told me he responded well to the tests.

287
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,598
And it's uh, very likely this coma is temporary.

288
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,299
What happens now?

289
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:28,914
I'm afraid I don't follow.

290
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:32,219
- Those girls now without Lucas...
- No.

291
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,515
Annabel, the girls need you.
They need security,

292
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:36,915
Protectability.

293
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:39,187
But I'm not prepared for this.

294
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:41,401
- I can't do this alone. This is not my job to do.
- Just...

295
00:36:41,402 --> 00:36:43,700
Just follow, if you not,
you'll lose custody.

296
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,899
And Lucas will be lucky if he sees
his nieces every second at Thanksgiving.

297
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:57,215
Well, I checked out.
All the doors and windows are locked.

298
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,467
No evidence of intruder.
Nothing's stolen. So...

299
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,202
So, I imagined it then, yeah?

300
00:37:01,604 --> 00:37:04,717
- All right, thank you, bud.
- Mom...

301
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:07,348
Richmond's finest!

302
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:14,443
Okay, guys.
Just you and me for a while.

303
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:17,000
I don't know how are you feeling about that.

304
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,370
But we got no choice.

305
00:38:33,237 --> 00:38:35,500
How they've been affected by all of this?

306
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:38,008
They are talking to the walls.

307
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:40,518
What did they say?

308
00:38:41,632 --> 00:38:42,932
Mama.

309
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:58,833
What's this?

310
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:02,187
They made that.

311
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:15,907
<i>They found a doll
in the cabin, Victoria.</i>

312
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:19,021
<i>Who made the doll?</i>

313
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:22,590
<i>Mama.</i>

314
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:26,017
<i>The doll's called Mama?</i>

315
00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:28,339
<i>Or Mama made the doll?</i>

316
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:33,360
<i>- Mama made the doll.
- And who is Mama?</i>

317
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:37,493
<i>Are you Mama, Victoria?</i>

318
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:05,054
<i>This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
Please leave a message.</i>

319
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:07,131
<i>Dr. Defuses, this is Louise...</i>

320
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:09,408
<i>...from Clifton Forge Public Records.</i>

321
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:12,194
<i>I found something that
you would want to see.</i>

322
00:40:31,168 --> 00:40:32,563
You guys okay?

323
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,027
What's so funny?

324
00:41:10,856 --> 00:41:12,156
Good night.

325
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:14,112
No!

326
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,610
Whatever.

327
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:25,008
Nice butt, Bruce.

328
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,394
Victoria..

329
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:03,904
Come. Mama.

330
00:43:15,116 --> 00:43:16,801
You guys know what time it is?

331
00:43:19,285 --> 00:43:22,317
I guess you wouldn't. It's late.
It's really really late.

332
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,955
Don't.

333
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:43,342
Don't what?

334
00:43:43,343 --> 00:43:44,963
Don't close the closet.

335
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,054
Why not? What's in the closet?

336
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,410
Nothing.

337
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:21,670
Okay.

338
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:25,312
It's been an along day. So you guys
should get some sleep. Go to bed.

339
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,111
You want me to leave the door open?

340
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:36,819
Good night.

341
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,608
Just tell me about it.

342
00:44:47,991 --> 00:44:49,979
I think someone's coming to visit them.

343
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,813
- Who?
- I don't know.

344
00:44:54,272 --> 00:44:56,649
- And you believe that?
- I heard her.

345
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,791
She was.. singing to them,
like a lullaby, or something.

346
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:02,106
You heard her?

347
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:06,076
- Definitely a her?
- Yeah.

348
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:09,853
Sound like this?

349
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:27,476
Yeah, but it was, it was different.

350
00:45:27,477 --> 00:45:29,221
Her voice was deeper.

351
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:33,043
Victoria is showing signs.

352
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:36,004
A dissociative personality disorder.

353
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:38,243
I think she could taking on the role of Mama.

354
00:45:38,244 --> 00:45:39,959
Literally, becoming her.

355
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,824
It's treatable.
With time and patience.

356
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:45,188
Am I safe?

357
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:47,565
What? Look, she's 8 years old.

358
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:49,706
Give me a break.

359
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,282
I found second entry under
the name of that woman.

360
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:11,682
Edith Brennan?

361
00:46:11,683 --> 00:46:13,455
Not Edith Brennan.

362
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,765
Welcome to isle 17, Doctor.

363
00:46:16,766 --> 00:46:18,679
Every archive has one.

364
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,643
Lost and found of things
people don't want to find.

365
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:26,849
Twenty years ago, when they moved
to Clifton Forge cemetery.

366
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,802
Some of the oldest, smallest remains,

367
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:32,225
were not claimed by the relatives.

368
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:34,787
They were sent here to be filed.

369
00:46:34,788 --> 00:46:37,483
I'm not a religious person,
but I do believe,

370
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:40,352
there's a place for human remains.

371
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:44,452
And that's not on the shelf
in a Government building.

372
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:57,148
Do you believe in ghosts?

373
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:59,235
I can't say that I do.

374
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,565
When a corpse is left out.

375
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:06,874
The elements withered. Desiccated..

376
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:13,040
Twisting it into a distorted figure that's
barely recognizable as a human being.

377
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:16,281
A ghost is an emotion went out of shape.

378
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:21,201
Condemned to repeat itself, time and time again.

379
00:47:21,202 --> 00:47:24,672
Until it rights the wrong that was done.

380
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,107
What's this?

381
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,241
The wrong.

382
00:49:59,157 --> 00:50:00,521
<i>Jeff?</i>

383
00:50:00,522 --> 00:50:02,457
<i>Save my girls.</i>

384
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,719
<i>Go to the cabin.</i>

385
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:24,648
- What happen ?
- Hold him still.

386
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:28,732
- Lorazepam. 4 milligrams.
- 4 milligrams of lorazepam.

387
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:30,118
<i>Skopolamin.</i>

388
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:31,723
<i>- Fever?
- No fever, doctor.</i>

389
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:33,568
Can you hear me ?

390
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:35,419
Relax Mr. Desange.

391
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:50,450
<i>You kicked me out of the bed. Checked on
the girls. That as much as I remember.</i>

392
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:54,746
<i>- For I know that you took me.
- I would've managed the job.</i>

393
00:50:59,024 --> 00:51:01,170
Oh, you drew me a picture.

394
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:02,986
It's a raccoon.

395
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,211
Thank you.

396
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:07,858
I do something
for you guys too.

397
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,508
There you go.

398
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:13,830
- You like it?
- Yeah.

399
00:51:14,473 --> 00:51:16,060
It's cute.

400
00:51:16,061 --> 00:51:20,551
<i>So, how was it? Was it a tunnel?
With the light at the end?</i>

401
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:25,160
<i>Oh yeah, that was good.
Also I stepped into the light.</i>

402
00:51:27,476 --> 00:51:30,928
So, how was it been?
How is the single Mom?

403
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:32,829
- That's great.
- Yeah?

404
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,367
- They're terrible. They hate me.
- They don't hate you.

405
00:51:36,368 --> 00:51:38,087
They hate me.

406
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:40,886
So easy for you to say.
You're like the cool uncle.

407
00:51:40,887 --> 00:51:42,993
I am the cool uncle.

408
00:51:45,618 --> 00:51:47,960
What?
What is it, Anny?

409
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:51,717
Just get well soon, so you can come home,
and clean their mess, please?

410
00:51:52,155 --> 00:51:54,004
You sure about this?

411
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:56,484
Yeah.

412
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:07,634
You okay?

413
00:52:13,237 --> 00:52:15,017
What are you doing in here?

414
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,145
Here, I'll help.

415
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:26,892
What is it?

416
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,313
I don't want you to get hurt.

417
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:30,664
What do you mean?

418
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,820
I'm fine.
Nothing bad is going to happened.

419
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:38,648
- You can't do that.
- Why?

420
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:40,738
She gets jealous.

421
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:55,978
Hey, wait!

422
00:52:58,945 --> 00:53:00,501
What's wrong with you?

423
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,300
Hello.

424
00:53:08,507 --> 00:53:11,943
Hey, Jean.
How can I help?

425
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,340
It's my day.

426
00:53:14,936 --> 00:53:17,196
Are you sure.
I thought that was Thursday.

427
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,861
It is Thursday.

428
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,274
<i>Sorry about the mess.</i>

429
00:53:20,275 --> 00:53:22,857
Children make mess. It's how it works.

430
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:26,345
- How are they?
- Adorsey. You want coffee?

431
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:27,646
Thank you.

432
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,445
Oh my God.

433
00:53:32,446 --> 00:53:33,746
What is this?

434
00:53:34,268 --> 00:53:36,437
I know, they're wild sometimes.

435
00:53:36,438 --> 00:53:37,994
It's not an excuse.

436
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:42,609
Hey, now. They're bruises.
Kids get bruise.

437
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,357
- This bruise?
- It's not like that.

438
00:53:46,862 --> 00:53:49,148
- Let me have them.
- Sorry?

439
00:53:49,149 --> 00:53:50,549
Just for a few days.

440
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,835
You can umm.. I don't know.
Play with your band,

441
00:53:54,836 --> 00:53:56,622
Have a drink with your friends.

442
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,851
Jean, I think it's great.

443
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:04,064
But the girls have relationship with their own.
I really really do.

444
00:54:04,065 --> 00:54:07,771
But right now, I need you to get out
of my house. Before I kick your ass.

445
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:17,047
I'll see you both very soon, okay?

446
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:19,600
Hey!

447
00:54:21,998 --> 00:54:24,708
- Do you've been coming around here?
- I beg your pardon?

448
00:54:24,709 --> 00:54:26,562
Do you've been coming at the house,
playing with girls?

449
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:28,227
Of cause not! Why?

450
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,667
Doesn't matter.

451
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:36,833
<i>Richmond ?</i>

452
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:39,388
Social Services.

453
00:54:40,479 --> 00:54:43,140
Who should I speak to if I believe...

454
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:44,665
...my nieces are being abused?

455
00:54:47,182 --> 00:54:52,415
Well, what kind of evidence
do I need exactly?

456
00:54:53,178 --> 00:54:56,257
- How the hell did you forget?
- Are you kidding me?

457
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:58,733
You know she wants to take
the girls from us.

458
00:54:58,734 --> 00:55:02,502
I'm exhausted, I'm sorry.
I forgot today is her day.

459
00:55:02,503 --> 00:55:07,892
Jesus Christ, Anny. It's one visit.
It's not much to remember.

460
00:55:08,256 --> 00:55:10,800
Anny, listen. They're just kids.
All you got to do is...

461
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:12,759
What? Chill out? Take it easy?

462
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,393
You know I can't do this. This is not my job.

463
00:55:15,394 --> 00:55:17,705
- This is your job.
- I'm out of here in a day,

464
00:55:17,706 --> 00:55:21,061
- Just hold it together until then.
- All right, fine, yeah. We'll see what happens then.

465
00:55:21,062 --> 00:55:25,544
I'll take care of them. Those girls
are the most important thing in the world to me.

466
00:55:27,563 --> 00:55:29,879
- Awesome.
- Anny, you..

467

<i>Okay, Victoria.</i>

Are you feeling sleepy?

470
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:56,487
I'd like you to tell me
about Mama.

471
00:55:58,362 --> 00:56:00,560
Did she live in that house with you?

472
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,186
The house by the lake?

473
00:56:09,123 --> 00:56:10,502
Where did she live?

474
00:56:16,695 --> 00:56:18,380
In the walls.

475
00:56:20,952 --> 00:56:22,524
Where is she now?

476
00:56:26,482 --> 00:56:27,894
I don't know.

477
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,798
I think you know.

478
00:56:31,297 --> 00:56:33,319
I think you know where she is.

479
00:56:36,743 --> 00:56:38,716
Where is she, Victoria?

480
00:56:40,153 --> 00:56:42,260
Is she here, in this house?

481
00:56:42,261 --> 00:56:43,927
Did she come with you?

482
00:56:46,743 --> 00:56:48,474
Open your eyes, Victoria.

483
00:56:50,404 --> 00:56:52,216
Look at this photograph.

484
00:56:52,217 --> 00:56:53,595
Is this Mama?

485
00:56:54,622 --> 00:56:56,777
- Is this Mama, Victoria?
- Go away!

486
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:58,175
- Tell me about her.
- No!

487
00:56:58,176 --> 00:56:59,476
Yes!

488
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:27,379
What's going on?

489
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,194
Nothing. Nothing's going on.

490
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,600
- Gerald, what happened?
- I have to go.

491
00:57:31,856 --> 00:57:33,229
I'll call you.

<i>November third.</i>

493
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:55,136
<i>The seventh session was more
than revealing.</i>

494
00:57:55,712 --> 00:57:59,080
<i>I think I have found the door, a passage,</i>

495
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:02,529
<i>that connects Helvetia into this house..</i>

496
00:58:05,334 --> 00:58:08,717
<i>There is no rational explanation
that supports this theory.</i>

497
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:12,669
<i>But it is only the ability to embrace
the different reality,</i>

498
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:16,726
<i>that makes science expand beyond
the limits of what we know.</i>

499
00:58:23,107 --> 00:58:27,711
<i>However, extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof.</i>

<i>I will come back from Clifton Forge,
with an answer.</i>

503
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,701

<i>Make her stop!</i>

505
01:00:50,969 --> 01:00:52,269
What's wrong?

506
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,644
What's under the bed?

507
01:01:05,922 --> 01:01:07,222
Victoria?

508
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:16,836

Where, Mama?

514
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:00,307
I know your name.

515
01:04:03,188 --> 01:04:04,904
I know what you want.

516
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,427
Lilly?

517
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:19,657
Lilly, are you okay?

518
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:21,968
How did you get down here?

519
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,666
You shitting me. Are you shitting me?

Okay.

522
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,240
Stop!

523
01:05:41,627 --> 01:05:43,456
Stop it!

524
01:05:51,723 --> 01:05:53,455
Stop.

525
01:05:57,726 --> 01:06:00,527
It's okay. Come on.

526
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:04,490
Tenanglah.

527
01:06:09,773 --> 01:06:12,324
Okay, come here.

What?

You like that?

Okay.

531
01:07:13,664 --> 01:07:17,115
Okay. Door's good, window's bad.

532
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,152
So, if you want to go outside,
what do we do?

533
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:22,941
- We use the stairs?
- Right.

534
01:07:22,942 --> 01:07:24,242
Lilly ?

535
01:07:25,622 --> 01:07:27,178
We took stairs?

536
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:32,419
Yeah, that's excellent.

537
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:35,275
Okay. Let's go get breakfast.

538
01:07:43,899 --> 01:07:45,654
Oh, God!

539
01:07:46,417 --> 01:07:48,952
Lilly, you scared the crap out of me.

540
01:07:50,715 --> 01:07:53,976
Annabel, breakfast is ready!

541
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,460

547

I mean, you guys talked a lot, right?

548
01:09:44,334 --> 01:09:47,590
Victoria, Dr. Dreyfuss and I,
we talked some too.

549
01:09:48,663 --> 01:09:50,332
We talked about Mama.

550

You and Dr. Defuses. You...

551
01:09:55,212 --> 01:09:57,346
You guys talked about Mama too, right?

552
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,797
Who is Mama, Victoria?

553
01:10:11,654 --> 01:10:14,989
<i>This is Dr. Gerald Defuses.

<i>I'm sure you are.</i>

561

Tahun 1887, horror came to Clifton Forge.

572
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,852
What was found at Helvecia
was a mystery.

573
01:14:14,544 --> 01:14:19,002
Havebeen someone
looking over them ?

<i>Can you tell me the story?</i>

577
01:14:32,073 --> 01:14:33,956
<i>It was a long time ago,</i>

578
01:14:33,957 --> 01:14:37,149
<i>A lady run away
from the hospital for sad people.</i>

579
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,582
<i>She took her baby.</i>

580
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:42,327
<i>She jumped into the water.</i>

581
01:14:42,328 --> 01:14:45,139
<i>How could you know the story, Victoria?</i>

582
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:47,226
<i>Did Mama tell you that story?</i>

583
01:14:48,847 --> 01:14:52,002
<i>- She showed me.
- How?</i>

584
01:14:52,003 --> 01:14:54,772
<i>- In a dream
- Go on.</i>

585

<i>She fell into the water.</i>

586
01:14:57,845 --> 01:14:59,658
<i>But the baby didn't.</i>

587
01:15:00,528 --> 01:15:01,828
<i>Why?</i>

588
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,350
<i>I don't know.</i>

589
01:15:04,844 --> 01:15:07,366
<i>What could've happened to the baby, Victoria?</i>

590
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:08,963
<i>I don't know.</i>

591
01:15:10,712 --> 01:15:12,493
<i>Mama didn't show you?</i>

592

<i>She doesn't know what happened
to her baby.</i>

593

<i>She went walking in the woods.
Looking for it. </i>

594

<i>She searched for a very long time.</i>

595

<i>And then?</i>

596

<i>Then she found us.</i>

597
01:15:36,336 --> 01:15:38,291
<i>Why are you crying, Victoria?</i>

598
01:15:39,124 --> 01:15:40,808

<i>Is she sad, or are you sad, Victoria?</i>

601
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:53,638
<i>Where is Mama?</i>

602
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:56,482
<i>Is she here with us?</i>

603
01:15:58,544 --> 01:16:00,527
<i>Can you show me Mama?</i>

604
01:16:00,528 --> 01:16:02,257
<i>She won't come here.</i>

605
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:03,558
<i>Why not?</i>

606
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:07,325
<i>Because she knows through watching.</i>

01:20:01,388 --> 01:20:02,688
Lilly!

Don't look at her!

619
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:17,323
She's mad.

620
01:20:18,854 --> 01:20:21,537
Go up! Lilly!

621
01:20:25,536 --> 01:20:26,960
Lilly!

622
01:20:29,097 --> 01:20:32,133
Lily! Open the door!

623
01:20:47,369 --> 01:20:49,663
- Victoria, what's going on? Are you okay?
- Annabel.

624

Are you okay?

627
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,521
Mama, stop it!

628
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:34,617
You promise!

629
01:21:39,267 --> 01:21:40,899
Leave her alone!

630
01:22:33,558 --> 01:22:35,002
Annabel?

01:24:46,706 --> 01:24:48,006
Lilly?

635
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,426
Victoria?

636
01:25:24,908 --> 01:25:27,671
<i>Hey, this is Lucas.

639
01:25:40,161 --> 01:25:41,461
Luc!

640
01:25:43,331 --> 01:25:44,631
I got your message.

641
01:25:44,632 --> 01:25:46,395
What the hell are you doing here?

642
01:25:47,443 --> 01:25:49,001
- Where are the girls?
- She took them.

643
01:25:49,002 --> 01:25:50,699
- What?
- I saw her. She's real.

644
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,673
- What the hell's happening?
- She's going to kill them.

645
01:25:52,674 --> 01:25:56,225
We got to get to the cabin.
She was here with them the whole time.

646
01:25:56,226 --> 01:25:58,159
Dr. Defuses knew it.

647
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,460
Oh, God.

648
01:26:23,997 --> 01:26:25,297
Jean?

649
01:26:50,129 --> 01:26:51,749
They're on the cliff!

650
01:27:18,224 --> 01:27:20,599
Victoria!
Lilly!

651
01:27:23,645 --> 01:27:24,989
