Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,600
"Who are you?"

3
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
It's a simple one, right?

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,000
No. No, not really.

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,300
Because if it was,
you wouldn't be here.

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,300
You people are going
to find out who you are.

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,000
So, you are going to write
a daily Journal.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And guess what?

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,500
You'll start the first thing
tomorrow morning.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,700
You're gonna get up,
sit down,

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
and you are going to tell
the Journal your name,

12
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,900
a bit about yourself,
your life and your world.

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,900
"Who...

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,400
"am...

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,600
...I?"

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,900
I shall see you all again
next week.

17
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,500
Journal entry, day one.

18
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,700
My name is Jack Giamoro.

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,700
I live in Malibu, California,
with my wife Nina.

20
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Nina is...

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,100
Nina is...

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,000
a good swimmer.

23
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,800
She likes to swim.

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
We've been married four years,

25
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,200
and she's a very...

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,900
strong swimmer.

27
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,300
My father, Ben Giamoro,
lives with us now.

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,700
Dad was a movie producer in the '60s,

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,900
mostly low-budget
teen car chase movies,

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
science fiction stuff.

31
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
It wasn't what he wanted to do,

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,900
but he was strong and bullheaded

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,300
and people loved him.

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,700
Six months,
two weeks ago today,

35
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,300
Dad had a stroke
that almost killed him.

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,500
Dad's...

37
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,300
Dad is getting better.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,900
I am a talent agent.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,200
I help talented people navigate their dreams
through a treacherous world.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I specialize in handling
television writers,

41
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,800
people that would be much better suited
to this assignment than I am.

42
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,100
Some mornings I get to work
and it's easy.

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm good and calm, relaxed,

44
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,800
ready to face whatever
the day throws at me.

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,500
Some mornings I get stuck in traffic, though.

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
I get stuck in traffic,

47
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,900
and I sit there and think about my life,

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,700
about the world,

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,600
about what's out there
waiting to take me,

50
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,200
to test me, to destroy me.

51
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,400
On these days,
I get to work Just a tad less friendly.

52
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
End of Journal entry.

53
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,300
Good morning.

54
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,500
Partner meeting in ten minutes.

55
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,500
I got it.

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,300
Hey, Jack, you need anything?
Coffee, bagel?

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,500
No, I'm fine, thank you.

58
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,800
Hey, you see the game yesterday?

59
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,900
It was a good shot.

60
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
Last minute.

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,200
Lucky, get out.

62
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,700
I think my wife
has been having an affair.

63
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,400
I don't know who it is,

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,200
but I think my wife may be
having an affair.

65
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,900
Partner meeting.

66
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,200
Yeah, I'm coming.

67
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
Be right there.

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,500
All right.
We gonna start?

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
We're waiting for you, Jack.

70
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you gonna sit down?

71
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,800
I've got an 11:30 at NBC.
I don't wanna crease this shirt.

72
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,000
Start.

73
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
You're a tragic figure.
I swear to God.

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,500
Do you have that David Lilly lunch today?

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,300
Yeah, I do, but it's not a lock,
so we'll see.

76
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,900
You'll sign him.
I have faith.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,500
I IMDB'd him last night.

78
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,200
The guy's created seven hit series
and he's still only 35.

79
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,200
He's way too hot for us
not to own him.

80
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,300
He's a bucket of money, Jack.
We need him. Make it happen.

81
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm aware of that,
thank you very much, guys,

82
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,000
I appreciate it.

83
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
I'm Just saying he took the meeting with me
as a favor to me.

84
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,500
So, while I guarantee you
I will sign him,

85
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,300
it may not be today
that I sign him, okay?

86
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,600
- Calm down.
- So, Jack...

87
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,100
what's this adult ed class
you took last night?

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,300
Where did you hear about that?

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
What class are you taking?
Journal writing?

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,700
What is that for?

91
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,600
It's a self-exploration technique.

92
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,400
It's meant to make me
a better team player here.

93
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,400
I'll probably be recommending
everybody take the class.

94
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,300
Oh, come on.

95
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,600
You got us in karate,

96
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,300
Kabbalah meetings,
environmental coffees.

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,000
Any chance you're gonna
shit-can this thing

98
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,000
so I can sit home one night
and lay around on the couch?

99
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,200
I don't shit-can things.
I finish what I start.

100
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,400
Why don't you Just go to therapy
like normal fucked up people do?

101
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,300
Why don't we start the meeting?

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,700
How about that?

103
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,200
Hey! Put the phone down.

104
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,500
Who'd you tell I was
taking that class?

105
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,500
Did you tell Arlene's assistant?

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
- The truth?
- Yes, the truth.

107
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,900
I think I did.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,700
Lucky, you...
Why would you do that?

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,700
That's my private business.

110
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,200
I don't like my personal business
being out in the street, okay?

111
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,900
As a blanket rule,
do not tell anybody

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,800
anything about my life ever, okay?

113
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,000
Who else did you tell?

114
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,500
- The truth?
- Yes, Lucky, the truth!

115
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
David Lilly's assistant.

116
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Oh, my God!

117
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,300
They wanted to switch lunch
to drinks last night.

118
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,200
I don't know how
you graduated from Harvard.

119
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,900
You have the common sense
of a five-year-old.

120
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,100
If I didn't have so much to do
today, I'd fire you.

121
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,600
Mom, I gotta go.

122
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,200
So, Jack,

123
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,900
what is up with you and this
Journal-writing course?

124
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,300
Come on, man.
What is that?

125
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,700
That's... that's funny that you ask.

126
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,000
That's...

127
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,200
Just something
I'm doing on the side

128
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,700
to try to understand
the writing process better.

129
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,700
Look, man, you know,
what it comes down to is...

130
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
I love writers.

131
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,500
That's my life.

132
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,600
I always wanted to be a writer,
but I'm not.

133
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm not good enough and... you are.

134
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,000
L... Look, I gotta ask you something.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,400
And think about this
before you answer.

136
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,900
David, are you happy?

137
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,900
Well, I'm not doing
anything as drastic

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,600
as writing a morning diary.

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,100
But, yeah.
I stay happy.

140
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,600
You don't have to dress
up in women's clothes

141
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,900
to write in that thing, do you?

142
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,300
That's funny.

143
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

144
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,900
- How was your day?
- Brutal.

145
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,300
How was
the scleroderma dinner?

146
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,100
It was good.

147
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,300
Bob Saget was funny.

148
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,900
Where'd you go after that?
I called you a couple times.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
You did?

150
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Yeah.

151
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,200
That's weird.

152
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
My cell phone was on all night.

153
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,500
Coverage in this city
is so in and out.

154
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,900
What's up with that?

155
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
Should I read this?
Should I?

156
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,300
No! I don't need
to read this yet.

157
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't need to read
any of your Journals.

158
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
You know why?

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,900
Because there's nothing in them.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,800
They're empty, boring,
surface fluff.

161
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,900
First week always is.
Nothing.

162
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Short staccato sentences
masquerading as disclosure.

163
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,700
It's what you know about
yourself without my help.

164
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,700
Your postman knows
more about you than this.

165
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,100
I want more.

166
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,800
This week, I want secrets.

167
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,700
Things other people don't know.

168
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Things you don't know... yet.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,900
Because, you see,

170
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,700
the clues to who you are
are buried in those secrets.

171
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,700
It's like hidden gold under
a twenty-foot pile of horseshit.

172
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,900
Nobody wants to dig through it.
But guess what?

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
It's in there. The truth.

174
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,700
Waiting patiently under
all the horseshit

175
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,500
that is the build-up
of our silly little lives.

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,200
So...

177
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
go in and get it, people.

178
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
Dig for the truth.

179
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,800
And people, please.

180
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,400
Spelling. It's important.

181
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,600
Get it right.

182
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
So...

183
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,800
I'll see you next week.

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,900
Hey, Dad.

185
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Hey.

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
You're up.

187
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,200
This was your mother's favorite show.

188
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,200
I waited too long to marry.

189
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,200
I should have done it in my twenties.

190
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm too set in my ways.

191
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,400
I've treated Nina
like a possession,

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,900
one of the things I've struggled for,
like my company,

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
my clients, my abdomen.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,600
I work harder on my abdomen
than I do on my marriage.

195
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,300
You know why?

196
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,900
Because this will be
the David Lilly Agency, that's why.

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,200
Because every
single person we have here

198
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,500
would be devoted
to advancing your career.

199
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Come on, David.
I talked to you last week.

200
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
You said you'd think about it.

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,500
You're unrepresented right now.

202
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,900
Yeah, Jack,
I thought it through,

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
and I'm gonna pass
and say thank you.

204
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
All right.
I understand that.

205
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
That's perfectly reasonable.

206
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,000
But will you
at least do me the honor

207
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,900
of passing to me in person

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,900
on the floor of
the Lakers game tonight?

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hold on a second, okay?
Hey, Brynn.

210
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,400
- Brynn.
- What?

211
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,100
You have play rehearsal tonight?

212
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,200
- Why? Who is that?
- It's Jack Giamoro.

213
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,600
He wants to know if I want
to go to the Lakers tonight.

214
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,500
Come on.
The hell he does.

215
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
He knows you left your agent.

216
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
He Just wants to sign you.

217
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,000
What's going on?

218
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,600
Tell him you have to
take care of the kids.

219
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,000
Listen, Jack, I'm sorry.
I cannot do it tonight.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,900
Brynn is in this play,
and tonight she's got rehearsal,

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,300
so I'm stuck with the kids.

222
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,200
The kids.

223
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,200
- Game over.
- I understand that.

224
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
It's more important than any of this.
Good for you.

225
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,900
Listen, buddy, I would benefit
from spending some time with you.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
What's he saying?

227
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,200
So, Just selfishly,
will you have lunch with me this week?

228
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,900
Okay, Jack.
Sounds great.

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you. Okay.

230
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,300
All right, I'll talk to you soon.

231
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Take care of yourself.
All right.

232
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,200
Piece of shit.

233
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, he trumped you with
that stuff with the kids.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
By the way, the Laker game?
Jack, come on.

235
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,200
You sound like a fool saying that.

236
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Every agency has got
Laker floor seats now, so...

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Anyway, you've got a bigger problem
than not signing David Lilly.

238
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,300
Phil Balow.

239
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,900
The puppy here was asleep at the wheel.

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,300
Whoa, the puppy was not
asleep behind no wheel.

241
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,700
- What happened?
- You put four calls in to the guy.

242
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,400
He hasn't returned one
in three weeks.

243
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Phil Balow's not calling me back?

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
Jeez, I must have been so crazy,

245
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I didn't even notice.

246
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,800
Didn't we send him something?

247
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,500
That was last month
when he moved downtown.

248
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,800
Phil moved downtown?

249
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,900
Yeah. Him and Sela
got a loft downtown.

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,400
I guess they think the Westside
is too white or something.

251
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,700
Downtown?

252
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600
Yeah, I don't get it either.

253
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,500
You know what?

254
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,500
I don't really get any of this, but, Jack,
fantastic Job signing David Lilly.

255
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,400
It's amazing watching
the master work.

256
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Thanks, Fineberg.

257
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
You're the best partner
a guy could ask for.

258
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,700
Sounds to me like you're
about to lose Phil, Jack.

259
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,000
Goddamn it.

260
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,900
Phil Balow was the creator
of the situation comedy,

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
<i>The DiPsy Doodle Show.</i>

262
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,000
I can't afford a problem with Phil.

263
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,000
It's all a math equation.

264
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm me because at any given time,
I have three Phil Balows.

265
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,100
Hey.

266
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
Jack! Jesus!
Sorry.

267
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,800
Did I catch you
at a bad time?

268
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
No. Well, yeah.
I mean...

269
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,800
No, you know, we're Just in the middle of,
you know, rehearsal.

270
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Sure, sure.

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,800
What's up?
What's up?

272
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,500
You haven't returned
my calls in three weeks.

273
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
It's not like you, Phil.

274
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,800
I Just want to make sure
everything's okay.

275
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,500
Yeah, no, yeah.
Oh, no, yeah, no.

276
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,600
I'm good. No, I'm fine.

277
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,600
- You happy?
- No, yeah.

278
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,400
Yes, yes, no.

279
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,000
- Yeah. Yeah, no.
- Okay. All right.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's all good, right?

281
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,300
I mean, that's the thing, right?

282
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,800
But... right.

283
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,200
But you know what?
I gotta do this, 'cause, you know...

284
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Right, right.

285
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
- So... Okay.
- All right. Great.

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
- Okay, man.
- Good to see you.

287
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,400
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.

288
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,300
I'll talk to you soon.

289
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Okay. Okay.

290
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,000
- Looks good.
- Okay. Okay.

291
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,300
So, we can't say "vulva,"
but we can say "fallopian."

292
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't understand.
I think "vulva" is fine.

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
Now, is it the product?

294
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
Is it because of Volvo
that we can't say that...

295
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,000
You have one new message.
Sent today at 6:01 p.m.

296
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey, Jack, it's Phil.
Look, I gotta talk to you.

297
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,900
It was tough today
when you came by.

298
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
Something's going on.
You know?

299
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,900
And it's Just not like me.

300
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,800
We've got to sit down.

301
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,900
You know, we been through
a lot together, you and I,

302
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,400
and let's talk in the morning.

303
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,200
Okay, we should talk.

304
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,000
He's leaving the agency.
I knew it.

305
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,200
What a life.

306
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,800
Jack! Jack!

307
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,000
L... I love these fish.

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,100
They... they make me happy.

309
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,100
Sorry.

310
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,200
How about some trousers?

311
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Okay.

312
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,800
Yes.

313
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,900
Jack.

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
Yes?

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,100
I've been sleeping with Phil.

316
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,300
It Just happened.

317
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,600
He was obsessed with me.

318
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,000
And we'd get together and...

319
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,900
I lost control
and it happened.

320
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,100
But it's over, Jack.
I swear it's over.

321
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
I'm so sorry.

322
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,000
So that's what he's
gonna tell me tomorrow?

323
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,400
Because I told him that
I was gonna tell you.

324
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
I made such a huge mistake,
Jack.

325
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,600
I'm so sorry.

326
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,300
I love you so much, Jack.

327
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,100
I love you so much.

328
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,100
Nina came along at
a point in my life

329
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
where all I did was work...

330
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
work and plan
and strive and deliver.

331
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
I became bigger than life.

332
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,600
I became rich and famous.

333
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,100
But I never smiled.

334
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,000
For five years, I never
cracked one genuine smile.

335
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Steven Bochco is on line two.
It's important.

336
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
Tell Bochco you'll call him back, Jack.

337
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,300
I'm going to a photo shoot
and you're going with me.

338
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,600
I can't. I swamped.

339
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,500
Get unswamped.
These are supermodels.

340
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,600
Tell Bochco I'll call him back.

341
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
That's what I thought you'd say.

342
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,200
Nina brought the light back.

343
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,900
It was dark,
and then it was light,

344
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,700
and the only difference was Nina.

345
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
- Look. You like it?
- Wow. Yeah.

346
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,000
I can paint or sew or whatever.

347
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,100
It's a room for me.

348
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,000
Do you like it?

349
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Yeah, it's great.

350
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,300
You have built-ins and everything.

351
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
- I know.
- What did this cost?

352
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,500
That's not important.

353
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,300
- That's not important?
- So not important.

354
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,500
- It's important to me.
- No. It's not.

355
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,800
I think it's important.

356
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,300
I'll figure out some way
to make it up to you.

357
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,900
You will?
We can figure it out right now!

358
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,300
Nina's on line one.

359
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,700
Tell her I'm not here.

360
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,700
Guys, we need to talk
about this thing at CBS.

361
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,500
We need to prepare for these meetings.

362
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,400
We aren't prepared.

363
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,500
You guys spend the entire meeting
talking about your little girlfriends.

364
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
That's only because
you won't spend any time

365
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,600
talking about your little
girlfriends, Arlene.

366
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,300
If I got one-third of
the snatch you get, Arlene,

367
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
I'd be the happiest man
on the planet.

368
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,100
You'd be the
second happiest man.

369
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,900
I'd be the first, 'cause you'd be
telling me all about it, okay?

370
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,400
We have a Phil Balow problem.

371
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,400
Excuse me?

372
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,500
He's been sleeping with my wife.

373
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,100
Okay, all right,
I thought you were being serious.

374
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
If that's the problem,

375
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,400
who hasn't been sleeping
with your wife?

376
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,700
So have I.

377
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,100
Me, too.

378
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
She confessed to me yesterday,
out of the blue.

379
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,900
Apparently, it's been
going on for some time.

380
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,800
Now, I'm telling you
all this as my partners,

381
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,700
as my best friends,
as my family, so I assume

382
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,900
I don't have to give
the confidentiality speech right now.

383
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,100
Oh, my God, Jack.

384
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,500
If this is true, I'm so sorry.

385
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,900
I don't know what to say.

386
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,100
Jack, this is true?

387
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Yeah.

388
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,300
Apparently, she broke it off with him,

389
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,100
but it may have been
going on for some time.

390
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Jesus Christ, Jack.

391
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,900
Is there anything we
can do to help out?

392
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,700
Well, you can support my decision
to drop Phil as a client.

393
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,700
You're kidding, right?

394
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,100
You don't want to drop Phil.

395
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,900
He's about to re-up his deal.

396
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,500
He's starting a new show.

397
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,500
You Just told me the other day
how valuable Phil is.

398
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,300
<i>If it does half of
what DiPsy Doodle does,</i>

399
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,300
we're looking at a package

400
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,900
that could be in the tens
of millions of dollars.

401
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Jack, you need to
take a deep breath.

402
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,400
Okay? You need to get
straight with Nina, yes.

403
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,100
But don't do this, please.

404
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,500
I can take him on day-to-day.

405
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,000
You don't even have to
talk to the guy.

406
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
He is fucking my wife!

407
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,900
What is it you guys
don't understand about this?

408
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
His name is off the client list!

409
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,300
Jack, come on.

410
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800
You're taking this really personal.

411
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,400
That's the closet, Jack.

412
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
Who designed this room?

413
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,900
The closet door looks
exactly like the exit door.

414
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,300
And we're supposed to
keep the closet door locked.

415
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,800
We keep making all these
proclamations,

416
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,700
but nothing ever gets done, so...

417
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,700
I know what you're thinking.

418
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,100
I hate it when you start
a conversation like that, Arlene.

419
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,300
Jack, you love this woman,
I know you do.

420
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,300
You want my advice?

421
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,700
Because I know she loves you, too.

422
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,200
She has been sucking
Phil Balow's cock, Arlene.

423
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,900
Does she expect me
to ever kiss her again?

424
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,800
'Cause that's not gonna happen.

425
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,500
You'll stop on your way home.

426
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
You'll grab some Listerine.

427
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,100
She'll have a nice gargle

428
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,700
and then you'll figure
out a way to move on.

429
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,500
That's great relationship
advice from a woman

430
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,500
who doesn't have a living plant
in her apartment.

431
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,800
I have plants.
That Joke is so tired.

432
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Did they send you in here
to save the Balow account?

433
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,800
Is that what this is all about?

434
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,900
Give me a little credit, Jack.

435
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Arlene, tell the truth,
and don't get all defensive

436
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,100
like you do when
you're caught in a lie.

437
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Did they send you in here
to save the Balow account?

438
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes, but...

439
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,000
- Get out.
- Jack.

440
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,300
- Get out.
- Fine.

441
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,700
I gave it a shot.

442
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,000
Thought you might want to try to act
like a human being for once.

443
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Not today, I don't.

444
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,500
Lucky, who do you know with a truck
that can move some items fast?

445
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,300
Oh, man,
that's a good question.

446
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't think I know
anybody with a truck.

447
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,000
My uncle's out of work.

448
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,500
He's got a truck,
Bunch of buddies.

449
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,300
All right.

450
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,500
Call your uncle,
come to my office.

451
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,500
You're spending
the afternoon with me.

452
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,700
Uncle Jimmy, hey.

453
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
This is Mr. Giamoro.

454
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,700
- How you doing?
- Jack knows me. Jimmy Dooley.

455
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,800
We grew up together.

456
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,700
Valley High, right?

457
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,600
I was in your brother
Anthony's class.

458
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,800
Jimmy Dooley.
Right. How you doing?

459
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,300
Good, good.

460
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,700
I mean, not as good as you.

461
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,300
Big shot now.
Big cheese.

462
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah.

463
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,600
Read about you in papers.
You've got this...

464
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,100
You don't call anybody back, but...

465
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,600
Excuse me?

466
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
You don't call anybody back.

467
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,100
I called you like ten times
about my girlfriend's screenplays.

468
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,000
You made me look like a dick
to my girlfriend, Jack.

469
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,600
I have a number of items
that I need you to move.

470
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
I'll give you the address
I need them to be taken to.

471
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,500
Okay? Come with me, please.

472
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm sorry, Jack.

473
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,500
I know I messed up,
but I love you.

474
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I have nothing to say to you.

475
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,300
Don't do this, Jack.

476
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,300
Don't be like this.

477
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,100
Don't throw it all away.

478
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,800
Stay in the fight with me.

479
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,400
Excuse me?
Sorry.

480
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,700
Before I go, I Just wondered
if it would be cool

481
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,500
if I left a headshot and resume?

482
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,900
Yeah. That's fine.
Just leave it right there.

483
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,300
Cool. It's the color kind.
It's the newest thing.

484
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,900
- Great. Terrific.
- Bye.

485
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,400
I Just wish I could
make you understand

486
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,200
how small and how sad it all was,

487
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,800
so you'd know how little
it all meant.

488
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,200
Your stuff will be in the garage
at your mother's.

489
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,100
You can do whatever
you want with it.

490
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,300
I'm no good at being in love.

491
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,700
I was in love once
when I was fourteen.

492
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,400
I was a fat kid.

493
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,600
A fat child. A fat teen.

494
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,700
No one in my adult life
knows that... only Dad.

495
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,200
There was a girl at school.
Leah.

496
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,200
Anthony, are you
any good at this game?

497
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,900
What is it?
Monopoly? Nah.

498
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,300
I don't play that.
I'm a dummy.

499
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,300
Well, sit down, dummy.

500
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,000
We'll teach you.

501
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,900
Tell your brother to sit down.

502
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah.

503
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,000
Sit down, Anthony.

504
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,300
Good idea.

505
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,200
End of entry.

506
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,000
Jack, you need to read this.

507
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,500
"Jack Giamoro immediately hired
a gaggle of low-rent movers

508
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,300
to come and purge his Westside mansion
of all her belongings"?

509
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,200
This is great, Lucky!

510
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,000
How did they get this?

511
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,800
The goddamn press!

512
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,000
Sheesus.

513
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,200
What is "Ling"?
What is that?

514
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,800
Chinese? Korean? Taiwan?
What is "Ling"?

515
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,400
I don't know, but the name
sounds really familiar.

516
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,500
- I'll find out exactly who she is.
- Do that.

517
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,900
Ling, my ass.

518
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,000
It's debilitating to know that after years
of pretending you do,

519
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,800
you actually don't have
the killer instinct.

520
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,400
I wanted to rip Phil's throat out last night,
but I couldn't.

521
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,200
Hey, can you help me out?

522
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,600
My brother Anthony
had the killer instinct.

523
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,700
Anthony went after
everything he ever wanted.

524
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,000
Anthony was like my father.

525
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,600
He was driven and had purpose.

526
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,400
When you want something in life,
you have to fight for it.

527
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Stay with it.
See it through.

528
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,800
You have to be willing
to go the distance in life.

529
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,200
I wasn't willing to fight
the fight for Leah.

530
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,000
And I couldn't go
the distance with Nina.

531
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,000
What I think you are starting to see,

532
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
if you're doing the work,

533
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,200
if you're staying with the course,

534
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,700
is that being honest every day,

535
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,600
knowing what you think,
knowing what you feel,

536
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,400
is getting very revealing.

537
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Doors are being opened.

538
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,700
Boxes that have not been rummaged in
for quite some time

539
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,900
are being looked through.

540
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Later, as we wind the course down
and I read your Journals,

541
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,700
I should know you intimately,

542
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,300
perhaps better than
anyone else knows you,

543
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,500
except, of course, yourself.

544
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
- Excuse me.
- Sir.

545
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,900
What do you mean,
read our Journals?

546
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,200
I don't think that's
gonna work for me.

547
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,200
I'm a very private person.

548
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,400
Okay. But you may as well leave now,

549
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,400
because there is really
no point in your staying.

550
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,900
Well, it's not that.
I'm Just not that comfortable.

551
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm not interested
in your comfort.

552
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,800
I'm not an anesthetist,
I'm a doctor.

553
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,500
I do not get cheap thrills
reading someone's Journal.

554
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,600
I am here to give you the tools
to help you to uncover...

555
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,800
...discover,

556
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,900
and discard...

557
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,600
the crap that is
holding you back.

558
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
And you, sir,

559
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,400
definitely have crap
that is holding you back.

560
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,600
"If a way to the better there be,
it exacts a full look at the worst."

561
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,100
Thomas Hardy.

562
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,100
Who?

563
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Who is Thomas Hardy?
Is that what you're asking?

564
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
Yes, I am.

565
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Are you not a college man,
Mr. Giamoro?

566
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,300
Community college.
Two years.

567
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,800
But I believe education
can only take you so far.

568
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,600
Quite right.

569
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,300
Absolutely true.

570
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,800
But ego...

571
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,800
...will not get you
the rest of the way.

572
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
It will feed you, yes.

573
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It will clothe you well.

574
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,800
But it will leave you cold and alone
and unknowing, I promise.

575
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,100
But if you would prefer to leave,
please go.

576
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,800
- I don't choose to leave.
- Very well.

577
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,700
So, when I ask you
to turn in your Journal

578
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,000
for me and me alone
to read, Just do it.

579
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
And remember the spelling!

580
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,000
It's a thing with me.

581
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,200
Hey, don't worry.

582
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,400
We're gonna get this guy.

583
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,600
We'll mess him up real good.

584
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,200
Teach him a lesson.

585
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,900
He needs one.
Playing gatekeeper.

586
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,600
All these people deciding
who does and doesn't get in.

587
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,900
You've been wronged,
so I'm going to fix it.

588
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,900
- Hello?
- Jack.

589
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
Hey, man, look, it's Phil.

590
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
We need to talk.

591
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,600
What do we need to
talk about, Phil?

592
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,200
Come on, man.
Don't be an asshole, okay?

593
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,400
I'm sorry.
I feel like shit.

594
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,700
I want to see you.

595
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,000
It's 8:02, Phil.

596
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,500
I'm running late.

597
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,200
I don't want to talk to him!

598
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
I won't ever talk to him again!

599
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,100
You sit down here.
Okay?

600
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,500
Now I really do not want
to hear any more about this.

601
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,200
Of all the girls in the world,

602
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,400
you had to steal one
from your baby brother?

603
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,100
You should be ashamed!

604
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,700
Anthony!

605
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,600
I Just don't want to come home

606
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,200
and listen to the same garbage
every night.

607
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,200
I come home from work,
I got a headache.

608
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,900
I've been shit on all day,
and then I have to listen

609
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
to this crap night after night!

610
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,400
I don't understand why!

611
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,400
Anthony needs to do
the right thing!

612
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Oh, come on!

613
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,400
I am taking him over to her house
to talk this out with her parents!

614
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,100
Anthony,
open this door now!

615
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,100
Leave the kid alone!
You're driving me nuts!

616
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,000
Get down those stairs
and get out in that car right now!

617
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,600
You stay out of this!

618
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,100
My mother never forgave my father

619
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,700
for letting the failure of his career
destroy his happiness at home.

620
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
She never forgave him
for putting a wall up

621
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,500
between himself
and his two sons.

622
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
You only care about Jack!

623
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,100
My father never forgave me

624
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,500
for not being thin and focused,

625
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,000
combative and determined
like Anthony.

626
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Between you
and your father...

627
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,400
And for the rest of her life,

628
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,100
he never forgave my mother
for killing Anthony.

629
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,900
Why the hell should I
have to forgive Nina?

630
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
- You've got about a hundred calls.
- David Lilly?

631
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,800
No, but I did figure out
who Barbi Ling is.

632
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,400
<i>She writes freelance hatchet pieces
for the L.A. Voice.</i>

633
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
Most of them are
maJor players in town.

634
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,500
She did the Sherry Lansing piece.

635
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,000
- Figures.
- It gets worse.

636
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,200
She's a screenwriter
and was a stand-up comic.

637
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,100
You know, one of them
Comedy Store wanna-bes?

638
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
She submitted ten scripts
within the last five years.

639
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,300
We reJected them all.

640
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,400
She couldn't make it in this town

641
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,600
and decided to tear down
the people who did, right?

642
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
It gets worse.

643
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Would you stop saying that, please?

644
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,300
You sound like a bit player
on a Dick Wolf show.

645
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,500
<i>She sold a full profile to the L.A. Voice.</i>

646
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,900
The one last week was
Just a teaser.

647
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,300
She's doing a whole thing
on you, Jack...

648
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,000
the evolution of the agency,
the stealing of clients.

649
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,900
Please tell me that's not true.

650
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,100
- I can't.
- Jack.

651
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,300
We need you in your office.

652
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,000
Right now.

653
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,800
Jack, it's important.

654
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,600
Phil called.

655
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,900
He wants to sit down with you

656
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,100
or he's threatened
to leave the agency.

657
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
You need to have lunch with him.

658
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,600
I'm not sitting down with Phil.

659
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,900
Nina called me, too.

660
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,500
She's destroyed.
You need to see her.

661
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,700
I'm worried about her.

662
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,200
Then you see her.

663
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,800
Hey, get this Ling
on the phone, will ya?

664
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,900
Jack, you need to do something.

665
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,700
He will leave the agency.

666
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,900
Jack, here's how bad
I want you to have lunch with Phil.

667
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,900
Are you ready?

668
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I will sign your cousin Andrew's no-talent,
acne-scarred daughter.

669
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,900
Okay?

670
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,500
- Call him.
- Jack, Barbi Ling on line 3.

671
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,300
Barbi Ling, how are you?

672
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm fine, Mr. Giamoro.

673
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
What can I do for you?

674
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,100
Well, I think that you
and I should sit down

675
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,100
and have a meal together.

676
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,800
Why? Do I sound hungry?

677
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,600
In fact, when you called,
I was having a meal.

678
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,500
Well, if you're like me,

679
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,400
eventually you'll have another one.

680
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Listen to me, Barbi.

681
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
I promise you,
you need me close on this, okay?

682
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,600
Profiles need information.

683
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,300
I can get you to who
you need to get to

684
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,400
so you can get
this thing done right.

685
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,600
Are we done?

686
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,100
Barbi, I'm being nice now.

687
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
This is the nice Jack
that you're talking to.

688
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,500
I know.
And I'm so very lucky.

689
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,300
Oh, look!
My food's here.

690
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,000
Fun meeting you,
nice Jack.

691
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm not good with the word "no."

692
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,800
I never have been.

693
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,000
I worked at the world-famous
Cameron Merrick Agency.

694
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,800
Morty, Arlene and I
all started in the mailroom together.

695
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,100
We were young and hungry

696
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,400
and had the power
of determination.

697
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,100
Once I found the business,
I knew I was gonna succeed.

698
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,600
I saw myself
succeeding so clearly

699
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,500
that it became
a moment in time

700
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,600
that I had but simply
to wait and prepare for.

701
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,900
Like a bus scheduled into the station
at a preordained moment,

702
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,000
I moved forward with confidence
that my day would surely arrive.

703
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,700
And when the time came
to make a play,

704
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,100
I made a play.

705
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,800
As our bosses before us had done,
we formed a new group,

706
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,100
took most of our clients,
and left the agency.

707
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,000
But first we copied all their secrets

708
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,900
so we'd have something to blackmail them with
if they ever came after us.

709
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,700
It was ruthless and bold,
a mailroom coup,

710
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,200
a time-honored
show business tradition.

711
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,000
Change is coming around again now.

712
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,200
I can feel it.

713
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,500
Dad?

714
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
Dad?

715
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,600
Goddamn it!

716
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,500
Hi.

717
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,100
Is he gonna be okay?

718
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,400
He's banged up.

719
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,600
He's got a couple
fractured ribs.

720
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,500
Pretty bad cut
on his back.

721
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,300
He's gonna
need to see a dentist.

722
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,200
His teeth are pretty bad.

723
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,800
It's not a problem, Jack.

724
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I've got the best guy
in Beverly Hills.

725
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,500
And Jack, the best thing about it is,
you won't feel a thing.

726
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,600
This guy will have you
on so much dope.

727
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,600
You're gonna love this guy.

728
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,600
Wait a minute!

729
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,000
He's not a dentist!
He's a comedy writer!

730
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,800
This guy's a comedy writer!

731
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,800
Okay, we better up that dosage, please.
Thank you.

732
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,800
Who let...
Who let the whore in?

733
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,600
You're a whore!

734
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,100
She broke the bonds
of our matrimony!

735
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,000
You screwed my biggest client!

736
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,400
Why couldn't you screw Garry Marshall?
He's about to retire!

737
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,900
You had to screw
a working client!

738
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,100
That's good!

739
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,400
I'll be in the waiting room.

740
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,400
Morty, he's here!
Morty!

741
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,400
Okay, good.
Did you tell Arlene?

742
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,600
- Yeah, she knows.
- Okay.

743
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,700
I'm here.
Where's Fineberg?

744
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,900
He's on his way.

745
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

746
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,000
Nobody mentions the teeth.
Okay?

747
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,900
Come on.
Come on, come on.

748
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,200
Talk about his quick recovery.
Talk about how good he looks.

749
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,300
- Come on.
- He likes that.

750
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,800
Okay, quick! Thank you.

751
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,300
Everybody upbeat? Okay.

752
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,500
So, how you doing, Jack?

753
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,200
How you think I'm doing?

754
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,300
I look like a goddamn xylophone!

755
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,900
Jack, Kevin Sands is
the best in the business.

756
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,300
He does all the big names.

757
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,200
You were in
so much pain and so wild.

758
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,100
He did the best he could.

759
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,300
I look like Tom Cruise's retarded cousin.

760
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,100
Jack, what did the cops say?

761
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,900
Did they find anything?

762
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,100
No. Guy got away.

763
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,700
They have no idea who he was.

764
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,600
Well, the important thing
is that you're back, right?

765
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,100
Yep, I'm back!

766
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,100
All right, I'll see you guys.

767
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,800
Maria?

768
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,000
Have you seen my Journal?

769
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,300
Maria!

770
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,600
My home was broken into
and it was stolen.

771
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,500
I haven't had an entry
in three weeks.

772
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,000
So, what's your plan?

773
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know.

774
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,000
You don't know?

775
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,600
You haven't been to
class for three weeks

776
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,200
and now you
don't have a Journal,

777
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,700
after you didn't want me
to read it anyway,

778
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,000
and when I ask you
what your plan is,

779
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
you say...

780
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,400
"I don't know."

781
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,100
Do you think I'm lying?

782
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
I've had a very
difficult few weeks.

783
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,500
Which, of course,
you did not write about.

784
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Mr. Giamoro, tell me honestly.

785
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,100
Why don't you drop out?

786
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,700
I mean, why are you here?

787
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,500
To taunt me?

788
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
It's not my way to drop out.

789
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Yes, yes, yes.

790
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,000
But why are you here in this class?

791
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,200
I don't know.

792
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,600
I Just had an idea.

793
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,700
Why don't you write about that?

794
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,300
Or would that be too much bother?

795
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
You don't have the right
to talk to me that way.

796
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
Great! Write about that!

797
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,000
Write about how
you cannot stand me,

798
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,200
how you'd like to pop me
right in the kisser,

799
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,800
how you'd like to
punch me on the snoot!

800
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,200
Write about it in
great color and detail!

801
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,700
Am I hitting a little
nerve here, Jackie?

802
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,400
Fill those pages!
Go out!

803
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,000
Get a new Journal and fill the pages!

804
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:52,700
Write about it.

805
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yes?

806
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,600
Okay.

807
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Thank you.

808
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,000
I miss that time in my life,
when I was fearless,

809
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,400
when the ground
was mine and I stood it,

810
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,600
when I was bullheaded like my dad,
and I was always right.

811
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,300
Mr. Giamoro,
I have told you before

812
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,200
that you cannot
make these outbursts.

813
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,000
I will see that you do a night in Jail
for contempt if this happens again.

814
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,600
Your Honor, give me a night.
That's fine.

815
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,000
But Just hear me out,
because this is important to understand.

816
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,400
We built this company, okay?

817
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,900
We put our souls into it.

818
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,600
We made it what it is!

819
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,700
And now that it's worth something,
ten years later,

820
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,000
our former employers
want to rip it to shit!

821
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,200
Okay, I'm sorry.
Bailiff!

822
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,000
You Just bought yourself
a night in Jail.

823
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,400
Wait a minute!
Hold on a second!

824
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,100
Ten years is too late
to come along

825
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,200
and throw the lives of
110 people into the gutter!

826
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,000
It's not right, goddamn it!

827
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,200
Get off me!
I can walk out on my own!

828
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,000
I can walk out on my own!

829
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:03,600
I was always ready to explode
if I thought you needed to learn a lesson,

830
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,900
if I thought you were in the way of me,
the way I needed things to be.

831
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,000
You're a fool.

832
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,900
Yes, I know that.

833
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,600
But damn, were you cute.

834
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,200
Wow. I mean...

835
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,000
That all changed for me, though.

836
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,500
It changed a little bit
every time Nina kissed me.

837
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,800
Jack, the Jury went our way.

838
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,000
What?

839
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,800
We won, Jack.

840
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,800
- We won?
- We won.

841
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Oh, my God!

842
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,200
The winning streak continued.

843
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,000
The agency grew.

844
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,100
Things got sweet.

845
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,900
The little moments took light
and the darkness lost ground.

846
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,500
Promises were made
and dreams were laid out.

847
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,200
The air in my world
had a preciousness to it then,

848
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:24,000
a peace that time would show
I didn't know how to negotiate with.

849
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,700
The deal of a lifetime,

850
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,900
and I couldn't close it.

851
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,100
Jack, Barbi Ling's calling.

852
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Yeah, I want her.

853
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,600
What can I do for you, Barbi?

854
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,500
I need some filler
material for my story.

855
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,200
I have reams of stuff now,

856
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,400
but I need to get the Juice
in between the Juice.

857
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,600
What kind of Juice?

858
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,200
About the early days
of your company.

859
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,800
The break-in, maybe.

860
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,300
The files you and Arlene
and Morty stole

861
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,300
and were gonna bribe
your old bosses with.

862
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,100
You have my Journal?

863
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,800
Is that it, Barbi?

864
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,000
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

865
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,000
But are you still hungry
for a meal with me?

866
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,500
I'm famished.

867
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,800
Rickshaw Inn,
downtown on Broadway.

868
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,800
Do you know it?

869
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,800
Chinatown. Yeah.

870
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,800
My family used to eat there
on Sundays when I was a boy.

871
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,500
I'll see you there
for dinner tomorrow night, 6:00.

872
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,900
Get out! Get out!

873
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,400
I don't care how busy he is!

874
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,800
Get me an appointment
with that goddamn dentist!

875
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,700
What the fuck?

876
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,600
Where is my Journal?

877
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,200
Fuck you!

878
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,400
What's the deal with your teeth?

879
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,300
You hold people back.

880
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,300
Bunch of rich white men.

881
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
Rich white gatekeepers.

882
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,200
What?

883
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,100
Is that the line she gave you

884
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,000
to get you to break into my house,
leave me for dead?

885
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,400
Let me tell you something, Jimmy.

886
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,900
You've got nothing out there
protecting you.

887
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,300
There's nothing.

888
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,900
No security. No gate.

889
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,400
No hidden camera.
No patrols.

890
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,400
Anybody can Just walk in off the street

891
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,300
and put a cap in
the back of your head.

892
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,400
Now where's my Journal?

893
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,800
And don't say, "Fuck you,"

894
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,700
'cause if you do,
I will shoot you

895
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,500
and I will take your piece of shit TV
and I will walk out of here,

896
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,000
and the cops will Just figure
it was a robbery gone bad.

897
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,100
Where is my Journal?

898
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,300
All you had to do
was answer my calls,

899
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,700
read her scripts.

900
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,200
But no, you couldn't do that.

901
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,500
You're too big time, huh?

902
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,200
You're never gonna
see that Journal again.

903
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,000
Hi. I need to see
Dr. Sands right away.

904
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,500
He's with a patient, sir.

905
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,100
Okay, that doesn't
work for me, so...

906
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,400
- Maybe you should have a seat or...
- It's fine. Don't worry about it.

907
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,500
Dr. Sands!

908
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,600
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry.

909
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,900
We're going to reschedule
your appointment to a later date.

910
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,400
Would you mind stepping out
to the waiting room?

911
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,400
The receptionist will
take care of you.

912
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,900
Sir, we're done with you.

913
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,200
Do these look
like teeth to you?

914
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,900
I can fix them.
You wouldn't sit still.

915
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,200
I couldn't get the mold right.
But I can fix them.

916
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,600
Goddamn right
you can fix them.

917
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,800
Cancel his appointments
for the rest of the day.

918
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,900
Get fixing, Skippy.

919
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
No one knows what
we're talking about, okay?

920
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,600
Try to act professional.

921
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,600
I'll try.

922
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,800
Hey, Arlene!

923
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,500
You ever eat at the Rickshaw Inn
in Chinatown?

924
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,500
Yeah, years ago. Why?

925
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,800
I'm having dinner there
tonight at 6:00.

926
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,600
After that, I've got
a little something planned.

927
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,300
And after that,

928
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,300
everything's gonna be back
to normal, I promise you.

929
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,800
Who are you having dinner with
in Chinatown?

930
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,300
Hey, do you like these?

931
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,400
They're temps.
They hurt like hell.

932
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,500
Maybe he's having dinner here with Phil.

933
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,100
Maybe they patched it up.

934
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,700
Maybe he's here
to sign the tooth fairy.

935
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,300
You got a better shot at that.

936
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,500
I'd take ten percent
of the tooth fairy.

937
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,800
Who owns the tooth fairy?

938
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,100
Yeah. Is it public domain?

939
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,800
That's not a bad idea.
Find out.

940
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,800
He's here. He's here.
He's here.

941
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,400
Mr. Giamoro.
How are you doing?

942
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,000
The Asian girl from Primkin's class.

943
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,200
Yep. The Asian girl.

944
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,500
So, what came first,
the class or the story?

945
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,200
The story.

946
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,700
Who's that girl?

947
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,800
I have no idea.

948
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,100
Who tipped you off?
Arlene's assistant?

949
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,700
Dooley's nephew?

950
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,300
Here's a question.

951
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,100
Why are you in a class like that,
a guy like you?

952
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,500
Well, to be honest with you, Barbi,

953
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,300
I think I took that class
for two reasons.

954
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,800
One, I wanted to
expand my horizons.

955
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,300
And two...
and there's some irony in this...

956
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,900
was to meet people like you.

957
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,400
Here's a question.

958
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,200
Why'd you pick this shit hole?

959
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,700
It's the worst restaurant
in Chinatown.

960
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,200
My family owns it.

961
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,800
That's my father at the register.

962
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,400
And all the busboys and waiters
are my brothers,

963
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,800
my cousins and my uncles.

964
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,600
Well, okay.
Let's get past that.

965
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,600
I want my Journal back, Barbi,
and I want you to call your editor

966
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,800
and tell him you're not
going ahead with the story.

967
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,600
Here's a little tip.

968
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,300
Tearing down other people
who worked hard to get where they are

969
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,000
is not a way to
advance your career.

970
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,600
My Journal, please.

971
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,500
No, no! That's...

972
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,800
No! You... no, no!

973
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,900
No!

974
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,300
Give me my Journal!

975
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,100
Jack! Jack!
What the hell's going on?

976
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,800
Who is that girl, Jack?

977
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,400
- Whoa! Jeez!
- Sorry!

978
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,900
Jeez, I'm sorry.
Sorry.

979
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,100
Why are these people
chasing us, you asshole?

980
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,100
I'll tell you later.

981
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,100
Jeez!

982
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,800
Aw, Jack!

983
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,300
Give me the Journal, Jack.

984
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,300
- That's what she wants?
- You gave your Journal to her?

985
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,300
Give it to her!
Give it to her!

986
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,600
- Give it to her!
- Wait a second!

987
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,500
Fuck it, abort.

988
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,400
Yeah?

989
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,900
Okay, I'll take him, but quick!

990
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,200
Hey.

991
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,500
I had my Journal
in my hands today,

992
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,100
and I lost it.

993
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,000
Morty fell,
things went sideways,

994
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,700
confusion ruled, and one of her uncles
picked it up.

995
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,200
Barbi Ling
has my Journal once again.

996
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,300
I headed home knowing
I needed to do something to change my luck,

997
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,800
so I drove to David Lilly's
in Brentwood.

998
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,800
It was time to Jumpstart the beast,
and I knew Just how to do it.

999
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,100
Hello there, neighbor!

1000
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,100
Just me, Jack Giamoro,

1001
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,500
your friendly
neighborhood IAA agent.

1002
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,900
What is this?

1003
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,500
David, I'm gonna
make a speech. Okay?

1004
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,900
At the end of this speech,

1005
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,800
one of two things is
gonna take place.

1006
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:48,000
Either I'm gonna represent you
or I'm going to Jail.

1007
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:49,900
So, hear me out.

1008
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,900
David Lilly,
I want to be your agent.

1009
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,500
I can make the deals
with the studios

1010
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,000
that you need to have made.

1011
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,700
I will have the studio people
over here catering to you.

1012
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,700
I will have them
doing your yard work.

1013
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,500
I will have them
cleaning out your litter box.

1014
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,800
I want to make you
so much money

1015
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,100
that it will screw up your kids
and your grandkids.

1016
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,800
I am bone-marrow hungry
to be your agent.

1017
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,300
That's it.

1018
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,700
What do you think?

1019
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,100
Ask him if he'll
represent an actress.

1020
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,300
I want this guy
repping me, too.

1021
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,500
Okay, fine.

1022
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,700
You're my agent.
You're my agent.

1023
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,300
Just get off my lawn
before the cops come.

1024
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:34,900
Yes!

1025
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,300
You're not gonna regret this.
Thank you. Thank you!

1026
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,500
I'm very excited.
Very excited!

1027
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,600
Jack, we need an explanation.
You need to come clean with us.

1028
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,800
Listen, I can't let her
have that Journal.

1029
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,200
This is the woman who's responsible
for the break-in at my house.

1030
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,600
She can't have that Journal.

1031
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,300
Why not? Why can't you let her
have the Journal, Jack?

1032
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,400
What's in the Journal?

1033
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
She's doing a story on me,
on the agency, our work, et cetera.

1034
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,800
Oh, God.

1035
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:15,800
And the Journal contains, you know,
it's private information.

1036
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,300
But, other than that,
everything is fine.

1037
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,800
And there's good news
regarding David Lilly.

1038
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,500
What's in the Journal, Jack?

1039
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,800
I'm taking care of it, okay?

1040
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,500
Jack, what's in the Journal?

1041
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,600
Information that directly
contradicts our testimony

1042
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,000
at the competition trial...

1043
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,400
as well as some personal stuff.

1044
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,200
You know, my feelings
about the size of my dick

1045
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,600
and stuff like that.

1046
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,600
So, Barbi, as we
discussed on the phone,

1047
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,400
we all wanted to
get together with you

1048
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,500
to talk about the scripts
that you submitted.

1049
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,800
Five years ago.

1050
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,400
Please don't
take that personally.

1051
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,000
We are looking at ways

1052
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,200
of speeding up
our reading department.

1053
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,300
As head of the future lit department,
I gotta tell you,

1054
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,900
I really think you have
an incredible body of work.

1055
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,800
- Really?
- Absolutely.

1056
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,000
- Awesome.
- Wow, how nice.

1057
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,300
Which one do you like the best?

1058
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,500
Well, to be honest with you,

1059
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,200
<i>probably
Chinese Girl on a Killing SPree</i>

1060
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,700
would be my favorite.

1061
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,100
Good one. Really edgy.

1062
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,000
<i>Planet Without Jews
was an interesting read.</i>

1063
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,300
Phenomenal.
Phenomenal.

1064
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,800
- Wow, thank you.
- You're very talented.

1065
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,900
Barbi, the point is,
we would love,

1066
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,200
love to have you as a client.

1067
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,900
A client?

1068
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,700
Yes. Yes.
Yes, we would be honored.

1069
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,200
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

1070
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,500
Which one of my scripts
was your favorite, Jack?

1071
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,000
You read them all, right?

1072
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,100
Every one of them.
Read them all.

1073
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,500
How nice.

1074
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,500
How does an agency work?
You take ten percent?

1075
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,800
I'm Just curious.

1076
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,000
Ten percent.
But, you know, really,

1077
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,300
it's really whatever
you're comfortable with.

1078
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,000
I read them on the shitter.

1079
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,800
Excuse me?

1080
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,600
Well, I was on the shitter,

1081
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,400
taking a shit when
I read your scripts,

1082
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,600
so I Just thought
it was appropriate.

1083
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,600
Jack!

1084
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,700
He is so silly.
Stop it.

1085
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,400
- He's kidding.
- That's Jack humor.

1086
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,100
Let's cut the shit, Barbi. Okay?

1087
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,300
We want the Journal
and we want you to kill the story.

1088
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,400
What do you want?

1089
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,600
You mean you don't want
to sign me as a client?

1090
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:33,100
No, of course we do.
Jack, come on.

1091
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,100
Oh, for God's sake.

1092
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,900
She knows we don't want
to sign her as a client.

1093
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,500
Barbi, have you ever
been to the Laker game?

1094
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,000
Have you ever
sat on the floor at the Laker game?

1095
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,700
You have no interest
in my work, do you?

1096
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,400
Well, it is tiresome.

1097
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,200
You're all so pathetic.

1098
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,800
Especially you, Jack.

1099
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,800
I have you people by the short hairs
and you know it,

1100
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,800
and you have no shot in hell
that I'm gonna kill this story.

1101
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,100
Get your asses back
to your side of L.A.!

1102
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,600
Well, that went well.

1103
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,100
Come on, Dad.

1104
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,300
Dad, what are you
doing in there?

1105
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,400
I looked these fish
right in the eye,

1106
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,000
and they looked back at me,

1107
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,600
and they...
they see right through me!

1108
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:26,200
They know who I am,
these fish.

1109
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,200
Okay. Come on, Pop.
Let's get out. All right?

1110
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:33,400
I treated your mother like garbage.

1111
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
Yeah.

1112
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,600
I should have been Just...

1113
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,700
...nice.

1114
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:50,000
But then, I was very hard
to live with back then.

1115
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,500
Okay, Dad.
Come on, get out.

1116
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,900
Okay. Come on, let's go to bed.

1117
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,800
I don't look back on the
good times I had with Nina

1118
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,900
as Nina and I.

1119
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,100
I know we had them.
We had many.

1120
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,400
But I remember them now
as if we were someone else,

1121
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,200
characters in a book or a film
or a game of some kind.

1122
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,500
Isn't this great?

1123
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,500
Yeah, but Just wait!

1124
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,500
A couple years up the road,

1125
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,200
I'm gonna start screwing
all your clients.

1126
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,000
Then you'll know great!

1127
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,300
I don't have a clear memory
of when Nina and I were in love.

1128
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,600
Babe, I told you, I don't
believe in therapists.

1129
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,800
I've been there.
They're weasels.

1130
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,600
They charge you an arm and a leg.

1131
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,300
You know,
you spill your guts to them.

1132
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,800
You tell them every little deep,
dark secret you have,

1133
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,500
and then you spend your whole life
praying to God

1134
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,200
you never run into 'em in public.

1135
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,400
No.

1136
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,800
If you screw my client
out of this picture,

1137
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,000
I will ruin you.

1138
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,200
I will smear this town
with your severed testicles. Okay?

1139
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,200
You are nothing.

1140
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,900
Do not cross me on this. Okay?

1141
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I'm hanging up now.

1142
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,800
Because your response to my side
of the conversation is irrelevant.

1143
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,800
Who was that?

1144
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,300
Just a friend.

1145
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,200
I gotta go. I'm late.

1146
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,800
Dooley. Pack your shit.

1147
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,200
You're fired.

1148
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:33,300
Excuse me?

1149
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,200
You want his Job?

1150
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,400
Yeah, sure.

1151
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,300
All right, Dooley!

1152
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,500
You're sitting at
the man's desk! Get up!

1153
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,600
Get up, get up, get up
and get the fuck out!

1154
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
All right, Jack.

1155
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,200
Before you go in there,

1156
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,600
there's someone in your office.

1157
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,100
I set this up,
so if you want to be upset,

1158
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,200
be upset with me,

1159
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,300
but the two of you
need to talk face to face.

1160
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,900
You're a piece of work,
Morty, you know that?

1161
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,500
- Jack.
- Is it all about business with you?

1162
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:14,000
Is that the only thing that matters
after all these years?

1163
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,000
I mean, can't you see
how lost I am right now?

1164
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,600
Just trust me, Jack.

1165
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,000
The two of you need to talk.

1166
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,100
Fine. I'll talk to him.

1167
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,700
Good.

1168
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,700
Morty told me about
the woman in Chinatown...

1169
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,400
and about the Journal.

1170
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,900
I've seen you writing in it.

1171
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:02,200
If you really loved me,
no matter what I did,

1172
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,900
no matter what
we were going through,

1173
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,200
you would not have
done what you did.

1174
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,600
Okay, you're right.

1175
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,500
I'm human. I'm flawed.

1176
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,700
I'm a flawed piece of shit, Jack.

1177
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,000
Is that what you want to hear?

1178
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,100
Do you want to hear me beg?

1179
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,700
'Cause I will. I'll beg.

1180
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,800
It's not in my nature, but I'll do it.
I'll beg.

1181
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,000
I'm asking for forgiveness.

1182
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,200
I'm asking you to somehow...

1183
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,700
Iook inside yourself and...

1184
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,800
find the place that
will allow you to focus

1185
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:57,100
on all the incredible good
that's happened between us.

1186
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,700
If you really love me,

1187
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,800
then why is that
so goddamn hard?

1188
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,200
Get out.

1189
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,200
You okay?

1190
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

1191
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,900
All right, well,
put your game face on.

1192
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
David Lilly and his wife
are on their way up.

1193
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,800
I'm going up.

1194
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,700
No. Let's be smarter than this.

1195
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,200
I want to get more on him.

1196
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,800
He's in pain, this one.

1197
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,200
The more I read this thing,
the more I see that.

1198
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,600
He's gonna do
something stupid,

1199
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,600
and I want to be there
when he does.

1200
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,400
I'm gonna have him in pain for you.

1201
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,400
Baby...

1202
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,400
Sorry. Please.

1203
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,800
Hold on.
Hide yourself.

1204
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,600
Please hide.

1205
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,300
This sucks.

1206
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,500
Nina! Nina Giamoro!

1207
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,600
Hello.
My name is Barbi Ling.

1208
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,000
I'm doing an article
on your husband.

1209
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,300
I was wondering if I could
have ten minutes with you

1210
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,000
for some background stuff.

1211
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,100
Do you think we could go somewhere
and get a cup of coffee?

1212
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,800
Does my husband know
about this article?

1213
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,700
Yeah, he does.
He knows.

1214
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,100
Okay, sure.
Yeah, I'll give you your ten minutes.

1215
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,000
Why don't we go upstairs
to the conference room?

1216
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,300
- Upstairs? No. L...
- I'll tell you what.

1217
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:52,700
I'll give you twenty minutes
of some very good stuff.

1218
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,400
My husband is
a priggish asshole.

1219
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,300
Really?

1220
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,000
Yeah. Don't be fooled
by the public face.

1221
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,400
There's a whole different
story behind the gate.

1222
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,900
Come on.

1223
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,100
Are you coming?

1224
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,900
Yeah, I'm coming.

1225
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,400
Hello, Mr. Lilly.
I'm Lucky, Jack's assistant.

1226
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,500
Jack is extremely excited...

1227
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,700
David Lilly!

1228
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:33,600
David Lilly,
how are you doing?

1229
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,900
I'm glad you came, man.
I'm glad you came.

1230
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,300
You remember my wife Brynn?

1231
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,700
Of course, of course.

1232
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,100
For the gate repair.
$6,000.

1233
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,500
That's very funny.

1234
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,500
- Just kidding!
- You got me!

1235
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,500
No, I insist.
I insist.

1236
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,300
Did you see his face?

1237
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,700
Let's head back
to the office.

1238
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,000
We'll sit down,
we'll get comfortable.

1239
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,900
Okay? Come on.

1240
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:15,600
Oh, Nina!

1241
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,500
Lucky! Lucky,
this is Barbi Ling.

1242
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,400
She's writing a story on Jack.
Jack knows about it.

1243
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,300
- Nice to meet you.
- Lucky?

1244
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,700
Conference room?

1245
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,500
Yeah, yeah.
That way. Ling?

1246
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,800
Yeah, Lucky.

1247
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,100
I see you.

1248
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,100
Morty, you're on speakerphone,

1249
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,900
and I'm here with Brynn Lilly.

1250
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,400
That's great.
I'll be right over.

1251
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,800
Jack, today
is your lucky day.

1252
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:40,100
Brynn, or Lady Lilly,
as I refer to her,

1253
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,600
is going to perform
a little audition for you.

1254
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,600
Oh, that's not necessary.
We're gonna to handle her.

1255
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,900
We've already decided on that.
We're gonna do a great Job.

1256
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,800
We have some career goals mapped out
that we want to talk about.

1257
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,800
Morty's gonna come in.

1258
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:52,200
I don't want any favors,
okay, Jack?

1259
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,700
I really want you to handle me.

1260
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,300
That's why I'm gonna do a scene,
and then, you know,

1261
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,900
you and Morty can decide.

1262
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,900
If... if it'll make you...

1263
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,400
if that's what you want, it's fine.

1264
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,500
Great. It'll be fun.

1265
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,400
Hello.

1266
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,500
Morty, Brynn is gonna do a scene,
an audition scene.

1267
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,300
A scene. Here?

1268
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,900
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1269
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,900
Okay.
Hey, sounds great. Good.

1270
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,700
David and I, with Jack's help,

1271
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,600
are going to do
the Michael Douglas/Sharon Stone

1272
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,000
<i>interrogation scene from Basic Instinct.</i>

1273
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,700
Okay.

1274
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,700
Great.

1275
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,500
And no, I am not
wearing any underwear.

1276
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,500
Seriously, you're so sweet.
Look at all this.

1277
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,100
You're like a little angel face.

1278
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,600
And you're the best secretary.

1279
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,100
Hi, Arlene.

1280
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,200
Nina.

1281
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:48,200
This is Barbi Ling.

1282
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,300
She's writing a story
on Jack and the agency.

1283
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,500
We Just wanted to use
the conference room

1284
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,700
for a few minutes,
maybe 20 minutes?

1285
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,700
Yeah.

1286
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,900
Actually, would you like
Arlene to sit in?

1287
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,800
I mean, no one knows
more about Jack

1288
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,000
and the agency than Arlene.

1289
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:00,500
Except for Jack.

1290
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,000
I don't think so.

1291
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,900
Okay. Arlene,
do you mind leaving?

1292
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,900
No, not at all.

1293
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:17,300
So, Miss Tramell
has waived her right to an attorney.

1294
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,800
Did I miss something?

1295
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,100
I told them you wouldn't want
an attorney present.

1296
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,300
Why'd you waive your
right to an attorney, Miss Tramell?

1297
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,000
Why did you think
I wouldn't want one?

1298
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,400
Sorry.
I told them you wouldn't wanna hide.

1299
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,300
I have nothing to hide.

1300
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,000
There's no smoking
in this building, Miss Tramell.

1301
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,800
What are you gonna do?

1302
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,400
Charge me with smoking?

1303
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,100
- I need you.
- Not right now, you don't.

1304
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,700
Would you tell us the nature
of your relationship with Mr. Boz?

1305
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,100
Trust me on this.
Just trust me.

1306
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,300
I had sex with him for
about a year and a half.

1307
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,300
Arlene, this is important. Leave.

1308
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,100
- I liked having sex with him.
- Jack.

1309
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,400
He wasn't afraid
of experimenting.

1310
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,900
I like men like that.

1311
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:05,600
I like men
who give me pleasure.

1312
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,700
And he gave me a lot
of pleasure, Jack.

1313
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,600
So Nina, let's start
with the big question.

1314
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,900
Okay
That sounds good.

1315
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:21,200
What's the name
of the bigshot client of your husband's

1316
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,200
that you've been sleeping with?

1317
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,800
Hi. Phil Balow to see
Jack Giamoro.

1318
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,400
Sure, Mr. Balow.
Can you please have a seat?

1319
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,100
You describe a white silk
scarf in your book.

1320
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,400
I've always had a fondness
for white silk scarves.

1321
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,700
But you said you liked men
to use their hands.

1322
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,600
No. I said I like
Johnny to use his hands.

1323
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,900
I don't give any rules, Jack.

1324
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,700
- I go with the flow.
- I go with the flow.

1325
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,300
Ever do drugs with Mr. Boz, Miss Tramell?

1326
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,800
Sorry. Yes?

1327
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,400
- Sure.
- Jack, it's me.

1328
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,600
- I'm trapped.
- You're trapped?

1329
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:40,500
I am.

1330
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,200
- What kind of drugs?
- I'm stuck.

1331
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,900
- Cocaine.
- I'm stuck, too, Nina, okay?

1332
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,900
We're all stuck,

1333
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,600
and let me Just say being
stuck is not an excuse

1334
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,000
for what happened
with you and Phil.

1335
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,400
Have you ever had
sex on cocaine, Jack?

1336
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,400
- No, Jack, I'm trapped.
- It's nice.

1337
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,600
- I'm trapped in a closet.

1338
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,900
Honey, I'm trapped in a closet, too,
you know?

1339
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,100
Okay?
Whatever the hell that means.

1340
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,800
How did you feel
when I told you

1341
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,800
Johnny Boz had died
that day at the beach?

1342
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,000
Who the hell is Johnny Boz?

1343
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,500
I felt like somebody had read my book
and was playing a game.

1344
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,600
Look, I'm in the
conference room closet

1345
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,200
down the hall, Jack,
and I have your Journal,

1346
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,700
and Barbi Ling
is outside the door.

1347
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,600
But it didn't hurt...

1348
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,400
...even though
you were screwing him.

1349
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,300
You still get pleasure.

1350
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,300
Haven't you ever had sex
with anybody else

1351
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,600
while you were married, Jack?

1352
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,300
Okay, that's plenty.
I've seen enough.

1353
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,400
My God, what a talent.

1354
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,400
My God, what a talent.

1355
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,500
I'll be right there.

1356
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,400
Morty?

1357
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,800
Yeah, yeah. She's amazing.

1358
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,900
You know who she reminds me of?

1359
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,200
Me too. Good.
I'll be right back.

1360
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,000
- Phil!
- Phil?

1361
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,000
Yeah, Jack, it's Phil.

1362
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:46,700
The evil Phil, who you refuse
to give two seconds of your time to.

1363
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,800
- We gotta talk.
- Okay. One second.

1364
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,300
David, I'll be right back.

1365
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,800
You were terrific.
Okay.

1366
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,300
I'll be right back, Phil.
Then we're gonna talk. Okay?

1367
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,400
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1368
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,400
Get me out of here, though.

1369
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,400
No. No, not "okay."

1370
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,200
All right?
I have something to say to you, man.

1371
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,800
Oh. Shit!

1372
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,300
I got your Journal back, Jack.

1373
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1374
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,900
Look man, I'm so in the wrong here.

1375
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,200
I mean, I am so in the wrong.

1376
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,000
I'm not gonna read it, Jack,
if that's what you're worried about.

1377
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,100
- I'm not worried.
- All right. Well, good.

1378
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,100
You know, I mean,
I'm glad you're not worried.

1379
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,300
But you hate me.
I mean, is that it?

1380
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,400
I mean, you Just hate me
and you can't forgive me.

1381
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,100
Why did you take this class,
though, Jack? I'm Just curious.

1382
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,400
You've always been so resistant
to therapy or introspection,

1383
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,100
and then out of the blue
you take this course.

1384
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,100
Why?

1385
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,000
- Answer me.
- Answer me.

1386
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,400
I don't know.

1387
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,600
I Just got to this place in my life

1388
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:43,900
where I felt like
I don't know who I am.

1389
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,400
I felt like, I don't know who I am...

1390
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,900
and I don't know how
to be in a marriage.

1391
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,200
And that scared me.

1392
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,200
Going crazy on me, Jack?

1393
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,900
No, Phil. I'm not going
crazy on you, Phil.

1394
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,600
It's Just that, uh...

1395
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,900
I'm imperfect, you know?

1396
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,400
I am. We all are.

1397
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:17,000
I mean, we're all
so damn imperfect.

1398
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,800
I know, baby.

1399
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:21,200
I know, baby.

1400
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,800
Imperfect, I'll cop to.

1401
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:24,800
Give me a hug.

1402
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,200
Not you, Phil.

1403
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,600
Oh, no, I am.

1404
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,400
After all that preparation,
he Just leaves us?

1405
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,500
- You know, I spent hours.
- I know, I know.

1406
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,600
I made this outfit.

1407
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,300
- He's coming back.
- Whatever.

1408
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,900
All right, get off.

1409
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,400
Come on. That's enough.

1410
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,900
It's locked.

1411
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,100
Yes. I see that.

1412
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,600
Jack, the police are on their way.

1413
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,500
You better get out here now.

1414
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,600
You won't believe
what's going on out here.

1415
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:10,300
Hello.

1416
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,400
You coming?

1417
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,900
Jack, you gotta get out here now.

1418
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,900
All right, all right,
all right.

1419
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,400
I'll be right back.

1420
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,300
You bigshot piece of shit!

1421
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,200
This make a good script for you?

1422
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,200
I know the ending!

1423
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,800
Barbi, go in there
and tell him this is over,

1424
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,400
'cause the cops
are about to get here,

1425
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,500
and when they do,
I'm gonna tell them everything...

1426
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,500
burglary, assault,
extortion.

1427
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,000
I mean, you'll go to Jail for ten years,
with an expensive lawyer.

1428
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,800
So tell me, is this over?

1429
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,000
Correct answer is yes.

1430
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,000
Yes, it's over.

1431
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,100
Okay.

1432
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,300
Go tell this idiot,
before he burns the office down.

1433
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,200
I could've been sitting here!

1434
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:59,500
No, Jimmy, no!

1435
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,900
- No!
- No, let's go, let's go!

1436
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,400
- We have to burn down his office!
- No! No!

1437
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,500
One problem, dickhead.

1438
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,100
It's not his office,
it's my office, okay?

1439
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,800
You stalking me?

1440
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,100
I am.

1441
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,900
I wanna come home, Jack.

1442
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,800
I wanna come home so bad.

1443
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,600
I Just...

1444
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,300
I Just wanna come home.

1445
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:25,900
I want us to get it right
and I wanna come home.

1446
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,800
Come here.

1447
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,700
I have made a decision.

1448
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:23,300
I no longer choose to
be a talent agent.

1449
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,500
I have left my company.

1450
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,700
My former partners all have voted.

1451
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,800
Arlene will replace me
and run the company.

1452
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,200
Needless to say,
this did not sit well with Morty.

1453
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,200
For the first time in fifteen years,

1454
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:41,000
I will be Just Jack,

1455
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,100
Something I have grown and built
and guided and nourished

1456
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:49,100
with every beat of life that I had
is no longer mine.

1457
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:53,000
I am nothing without the elixir
of constant movement.

1458
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,500
I do not know how to Just be still.

1459
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,700
So I shall read these,

1460
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,300
and within two weeks,

1461
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,900
you'll be receiving
a grade and an evaluation.

1462
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,500
Thank you. Thank you.

1463
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,600
I have no problem
with you reading this,

1464
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,100
you and you alone,

1465
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,800
if that's what it takes
to finish the course.

1466
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,800
Wonderful.

1467
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,500
I do not need
an evaluation, however.

1468
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,200
Give me any grade you want.
I'm done.

1469
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,000
I gotta tell you something.

1470
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,600
You're a real shitbag, Primkin.

1471
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,400
All in all, though,

1472
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,600
I think you taught
a pretty good class.

1473
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,800
Thank you.

1474
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,300
So, you're done.
Is that it?

1475
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,400
That's it. I'm done.

1476
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,600
Good. You've done well, son.

1477
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,800
You done good.

1478
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:00,900
Except...

1479
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,700
you spelled "Primkin" wrong.

1480
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,500
God.

1481
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,500
Nina and I
have a long way to go.

1482
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,000
With the odds against us,

1483
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,900
we are determined
to make it work.

1484
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,300
There's things I'll need to forget.

1485
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,300
There's things she'll need
to make sure I remember.

1486
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,400
How is it possible that I
still have so much to learn?

1487
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,300
End of entry.

1488
01:30:39,305 --> 01:30:45,315
