- It's mojito.

159
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,883
I mean, I didn't think it was wee.

160
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,521
Why would it be wee? That would imply
very poor personal hygiene.

161
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,762
I mean, I don't wipe with my hand.

162
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,043
I use toilet paper
just like everyone else does.

163
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,885
- Well, that's a relief.
- Hm.

164
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,407
So is wee in a way,
if you think about it.

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,645
Hm...

166
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,890
Hm...

167
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,521
- Oh, how about another drink?
- Yeah, that would be great. Yeah.

168
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,766
- Let me get these.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

169
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,888
- No, it's alright.
- No, no, seriously.

170
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,531
- OK, you can get them.
- You get them?

171
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,685
- I'll get them, shall I?
- Great, cheers. Thank you.

172
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,011
Ah... Busted.

173
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,765
You've got a picture of your ex
in the old wallet.

174
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,729
Oh, no, that's my sister.

175
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,806
Oh. She's very pretty.
I bet she gets all "ze boyz".

176
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,443
She's dead.

177
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,211
Wow. It's going so well.

178
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,930
No, Elaine, I've got pictures
of my cats in my wallet

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,525
and they're alive and kicking

180
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,728
<i>and I want people
to ask me about them.</i>

181
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,043
- Well, it's good that you went.
- Why is it good?

182
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,761
It's just so excruciating
and predictable, just as it always is.

183
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,447
I'm just gonna let my vagina
hermetically seal up.

184
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,291
<i>- Yeah, well, that will really help.
- Never hurt Barbie.</i>

185
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,081
She's got a beach buggy
and horses and a salon.

186
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,400
And a boyfriend.

187
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,524
Is she still with that guy?
Such a fake smile.

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,770
- How long are you gonna be?
- Get your arse over here pronto.

189
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,049
We have a lot of nibbles
to put into a lot of bowls.

190
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,122
About two hours.

191
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,443
<i>A reminder to all passengers
that due to engineering work</i>

192
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,166
<i>no trains are currently stopping
at Clapham Junction.</i>

193
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,607
- About seven hours.
- What the fuck?!

194
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,650
<i>- I'm joking.
- Not funny.</i>

195
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,722
- I can't do this on my own.
- Hello.

196
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,643
And don't forget the chocolate mousse.

197
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,007
<i>Mum's obsessed.
And you've done your speech?</i>

198
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,286
I've got a rough draft.

199
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,250
You haven't. You've done
a lot of doodles and crossing out.

200
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,607
- I mean, as if.
- Come on.

201
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,648
You know Dad loves it
when you do a speech.

202
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,564
So it needs to be good and special.
OK?

203
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,880
Fine.

204
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,291
<i>- Oh, and Nancy?
- Yeah'?</i>

205
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,684
Don't seal up just yet.
It'll happen. I promise.

206
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,603
Yeah, yeah. Fuck off.

207
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,921
Oh.

208
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,290
Black...

209
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,010
"Pant"

210
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,969
...wash.

211
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,889
Sorry.

212
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,645
I couldn't help overhearing.

213
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,088
You should really think about
reading this.

214
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,162
Right. Right, right, right, right.

215
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,760
- Did it, then?
- Did it what?

216
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,411
- Change your life.
- Oh, erm...

217
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,524
- Maybe. Yeah.
- But maybe not as well?

218
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,889
Well, I like to give everything a go,
because otherwise what's the point?

219
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,921
You've got to hope it's going to work.
Because what is life without hope?

220
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,281
- Death.
- Death it is, then.

221
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,125
You see, you do need to read it.

222
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,522
I would lend you my copy
but I need it for my date.

223
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,525
- Why do you need a book for a date?
- It's how we'll recognise each other.

224
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,410
Oh, it's a setup? They always work.

225
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,366
They often work if the matchmaker
has done their homework.

226
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,365
All successful relationships are based
on whether you're both outdoorsy...

227
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,885
- Read it.
- Don't need to.

228
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,167
- It was a best seller.
- So was The Da <i>Vinci</i> Code.

229
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,005
- Another excellent book.
- Not an excellent book.

230
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,845
- I think it's what you need.
- Why does everyone tell me that?

231
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,400
If they're always telling you,
you should listen.

232
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,763
I think you need to shh.
You need to shh your mouth.

233
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,887
- You want me to shh?
- I do, yeah. It would be great.

234
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,849
- I'm only suggest...
- It's time.

235
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,048
I think... I think we're done.

236
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,010
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

237
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,766
<i>we are now arriving at our final
destination, London Waterloo.</i>

238
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,690
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- I say.

239
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,371
Ow. Shit.

240
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,891
What?

241
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,689
- Excuse me, please.
- What?!

242
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,762
- There you go.
- Cheers.

243
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,649
- Where the fuck are you?
- Blimey, I'm not that late, am I?

244
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,927
Somebody threw themselves
on the track again.

245
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,526
I don't blame them,
there's so many delays.

246
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,047
Hey, what a great way for us to
recognise each other. What a great idea.

247
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,841
Although I think it would have been hard
to miss you under that huge clock.

248
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,046
No, no, no...

249
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,203
What do we do in terms of saying hello?
I never know where to pitch it.

250
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,362
Is it a handshake? Ls it a hug?
Ls it formal?

251
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,728
You know what, we're adults.
Let's just go in... Too soon for that?

252
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,848
Hello, there.

253
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,129
Oh, my God, that's not your
emergency exit phone call already?

254
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,602
I haven't had a chance
to use any of my best lines yet.

255
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,762
That wasn't one of them,
if you were worried.

256
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,524
Listen, I'll handle this, madam.

257
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,285
Hello, caller. Yes, we have met.

258
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,091
I am not a complete psychopath
and we've really hit it off.

259
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,004
She will call you later
with all the gory details.

260
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,765
So thank you for calling and goodbye.
There, done.

261
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,084
Alright! So, book, check.
And clock, check.

262
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,084
And blind date. Check!

263
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,042
Usually in this situation I would say
something and you'd say something back.

264
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,124
And then we'd talk about what we're
gonna do and exchange ideas.

265
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,646
You know, sort of
"quid pro quo, Clarice".

266
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,409
In hindsight, that wasn't the best
impression to do on a first date

267
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,570
because it... it brings to mind...
Anyway, I'm talking a lot

268
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,371
and I know you can sense it.
So I'm gonna just keep going

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,930
and I'm gonna start the bidding

270
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,083
with a drink on London's
fashionable South Bank.

271
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,403
So, as the book says,
what are you waiting for?

272
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,722
I am waiting for you.

273
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,971
- Good. Good.
- Yeah.

274
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,169
OK. Shall we...? After you, my lady.

275
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,764
I'm not a knight.

276
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,320
Yeah, let's do it.
We'll go out this way...

277
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,685
What do you think?
Good stuff for the first few hours?

278
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,127
Descending in quality as we do.

279
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,249
I'd go quality and quantity, Bert.
It's a massive night.

280
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,403
You're right. We bloody deserve it.

281
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,443
Let's go mental.

282
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,007
Seriously, you do deserve it.
I don't know how you've done it.

283
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,402
Not that I don't intend to go
the whole distance myself, obviously.

284
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,842
I think the trick is, get through
the first 30, 40 years,

285
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,720
then just kind of give up.
From that point on it's a breeze.

286
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,802
- No, I mean it.
- How are we getting on?

287
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,087
- We are nailing it.
- That's great.

288
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,640
You can put about
half those lagers back, Adam.

289
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,882
What does Nancy want to drink?

290
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,281
- I'm not sure if...
- She wants vodka.

291
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,443
The only spirit she can out-drink me on.
We'll see about that later.

292
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,721
No, we won't.

293
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,327
Guys, she didn't even answer the phone.
Some man did. I think she's on a date.

294
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,971
The man from last night?
I thought that didn't work out.

295
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,849
It didn't. It was a disaster.

296
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,810
- He was in love with his sister.
- Who answered the phone, then?

297
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,406
Dad, I don't know.
He said he wasn't a psychopath.

298
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,568
Well, that sounds encouraging.

299
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,167
We're having a party. She's on a date.
I'm thinking she's gonna bring him.

300
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,322
- Bert!
- If he's not a psychopath.

301
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,290
Did he sound like a wine drinker
or more of a beer man?

302
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,441
<i>Bert!</i>

303
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,040
- I'm just getting some more wine.
- Course you are.

304
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,726
The good host is prepared
for all eventualities.

305
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,768
Come on, Pattersons, clock's ticking.

306
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,161
Fran, you walk straight past that offer.

307
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,721
So, what's going on? Ls Nancy OK?

308
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,804
Yes. Yes, Mum, she's fine. She's just...

309
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,121
- He's looking forward to her speech.
- I know.

310
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,044
- So she is coming?
- Yes, of course she's coming.

311
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,363
Look, do you want me to write
a few words? You know, just in case.

312
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,088
Not really, darling, no.

313
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,243
Oh, God. That is horrible.

314
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,765
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,049
- I'll give her a call, then.
- Yes, please do, darling.

316
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,210
Ah...

317
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,687
- You OK? You seem a bit freaked out.
- Do I?

318
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,886
Yeah.

319
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,089
Gosh. Sorry, just bit of
a first-date no-no...

320
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,811
Oh, my God, that's embarrassing.

321
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,008
- Oh, it's Tom.
- Oh.

322
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,241
Hey, buddy.

323
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,566
Yeah, I'm here. I'm with Jessica.

324
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,768
Yeah, we're on the South Bank.

325
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,366
Yeah, d'you wanna speak to her?
Alright.

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,411
We will.

327
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,129
Yeah. OK, Tom.
Yeah, I'm gonna hang up now.

328
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,884
Yeah, OK. Bye. Bye.

329
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,725
- He thought we hadn't met up.
- As if.

330
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,043
- Shall we switch these things off?
- Yeah. OK, good.

331
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,445
Right. So, Jessica.

332
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,800
So...

333
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,805
- Tom says that you work in the City.
- I do, yeah. That's what I do.

334
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,611
- Is that a stressful job?
- Ah, no.

335
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,001
"Lunch is for wimps."

336
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,081
Sorry.

337
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,208
- No, no, it's from Wall Street.
- Yeah.

338
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,443
"If you need a friend, get a dog."
I love that movie.

339
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,006
- You do?
- Yeah, it's one of my favourites.

340
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,323
- And you are a...?
- I'm an online marketing manager.

341
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,529
I love online marketing managing.

342
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,246
What I really wanna do is paint.

343
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,891
I don't wanna be an online
marketing manager forever

344
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,203
because, you know,
the bots are taking over!

345
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,727
They're gonna be managing
all the marketing in the future.

346
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,124
- It's like "help".
- Exactly, yeah. Erm...

347
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,248
- I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.
- Really?

348
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,451
Yeah. A little bit. Just a little bit.
I'm not used to all this dating chat.

349
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,804
Although, you know, I had a few
reservations about today,

350
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,770
but I just thought,
"You know what, Jack? I trust Tom."

351
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,890
He's not gonna set me up with somebody
who I've nothing in common with.

352
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,041
- And he's a good friend, right?
- Who, Tom?

353
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,043
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'd take a bullet for him.

354
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,567
Yeah. So, shall we
get a beer or something?

355
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,450
- There's one of those pop-up bars.
- Sure, that'll be great.

356
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,245
They appear out of nowhere,
then they're gone the next day.

357
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,881
This can't be our favourite place
because it'll be gone in the morning.

358
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,043
- Can we get two Red Stripes?
- That'd be great.

359
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,724
- So...
- So...

360
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,883
Where are you on the old, you know,
the relationship...

361
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,689
the spectrum of relationships?

362
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,049
- It's my mime for relationships.
- That's good. Right.

363
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,851
Well, I guess long-term-wise it's...

364
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,843
It's been a while.

365
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,605
- Since Pete, right?
- Since Pete.

366
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,125
Tom told me. Massive cock.

367
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,247
- Really?
- Huge.

368
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,243
- It wasn't that big...
- What he did to you.

369
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,606
- ...a deal.
- Unforgivable.

370
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,921
I know how it feels.
I had it done to me, you know.

371
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,571
- Affairs, eh? Who'd have them?
- Yeah...

372
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,880
- They would.
- They would.

373
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,440
The other people would.

374
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,291
So where are you on the... spectrum?

375
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,046
On the spectrum? I think recently,
I've had a few one-night stands.

376
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,647
You know, just girls I've met at work

377
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,405
and in bars and just, like,
on the street.

378
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,041
But this is my first real date really
since the D-word.

379
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,081
- Dead sister?
- Sorry?

380
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,970
Just something I say before I drink.
Dead sister.

381
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,166
Dead sister.

382
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,722
But I'm not gonna let a failed marriage
put me off relationships for good.

383
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,211
Divorce.

384
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,931
You be thankful that
you and Pete didn't get hitched.

385
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,766
It gets a lot more complicated when you
have to figure out who gets the flat.

386
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,285
Winner.

387
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,242
- I did.
- Yeah.

388
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,761
I got big home-improvement plans.
I'm gonna do up our... my flat.

389
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,922
Paint the hallways, bleach the sheets.

390
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,049
Anyway, let's not talk about that.
It's just bad juju.

391
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,407
- And I'm so over it.
- You really sound it.

392
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,081
It's <i>in</i> the past. What does <i>it</i> say
<i>in</i> Six Billion People and You?

393
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,891
- F... Fuck the past.
- Fuck the past, yeah.

394
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,964
If that book has taught me anything,
it's taught me that.

395
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,407
So, Tom says you're a triathlete.

396
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,121
- Hm-hmm.
- Do you have to train a lot for that?

397
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,931
Yeah, I've just got
to regularly carb up.

398
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,331
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

399
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,529
Go on then. I don't mind.
I've actually worked out today...

400
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,571
I work out every day.
I like to keep fit. I pump iron, sure.

401
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,360
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

402
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,286
This is nice, isn't it? I don't envy
any of my friends with kids.

403
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,806
Are they here now? Hell, no.

404
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,327
They're at home lying in wait
for the next nappy change.

405
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,686
Not that I don't want kids.

406
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,048
I'm 40. They're not gonna be swimming
in the right direction forever.

407
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,966
But just not right now. I should
probably get a girlfriend first.

408
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,728
I definitely want kids. I'm just not
freaking out about it yet.

409
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,406
I mean, why would you? You're 24.

410
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,807
D'you wanna get out of here?
It is fucking freezing

411
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,202
and I know a really fun place
just over the river.

412
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,285
We can get shots and maybe hang out
a bit more if you feel like it.

413
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,764
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- OK.

414
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,047
- This is gonna be fun.
- Yeah. What is it?

415
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,884
It's like a cantina.

416
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,804
It's a bit cheesy
but you can have slammers and...

417
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,529
<i>oh, wow. Arriba!</i>

418
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,210
- Hey, man.
- How's it going?

419
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,526
- Are you a regular here?
- Well, define "regular". What is it?

420
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,887
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, Helen, how's it going?

421
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,007
Oh, so you...

422
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,241
Ah! Snap.

423
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,163
- We're swapping, right?
- Swapping?

424
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,926
For the genius Six Billion Ways to get
to know you list that you suggested.

425
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,571
Is that your one?
Mine's at the front. OK...

426
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,211
Hm...

427
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,931
Let's have a look, shall we?
OK, then.

428
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,368
Shall I read yours first?
"Put yourself out there."

429
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,251
"Take chances."

430
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,290
- "Black pant wash."
- It's a band.

431
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,207
- Are they new?
- Yeah, they're new.

432
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,727
They're... They're fresh. Very young.
They're my favourite band.

433
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,451
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, they're very, er, funky.

434
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,561
"Get stronger thighs."

435
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,201
Hey, this is spooky.
I also love spaghetti bolognese.

436
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,009
What are the chances of that?

437
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,402
- Like none chances.
- I know. That's the lists done.

438
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,090
- Yeah!
- And didn't they go well?

439
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,924
- Really great.
- That was...

440
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,731
- Look, let me get this.
- No, I should get it.

441
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,167
- Please, let me.
- OK. I'll get the next ones.

442
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,005
- Oh, my God. Who are they?
- Who, what?

443
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,290
- These guys.
- Oh, this is Slash and Axl.

444
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,691
Oh.

445
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,285
Paradise Kitties.

446
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,248
- I blew it, sorry. That was no good.
- Er...

447
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,369
Jack. I've got a confession to make
and I'm just gonna...

448
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,522
- So have I.
- "Come out with it. You have?

449
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,968
- I have, yeah. Let me go first. I...
- OK.

450
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,883
I've never heard of Black Pant Wash.

451
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,401
I'm sorry. I wanna be honest with you,
because honesty is very important...

452
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,567
Yes, I agree.

453
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,042
These lists are great
and they're a brilliant ice-breaker,

454
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,761
but you don't really believe that
just because we both like spag bol,

455
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,650
we're gonna wind up together
forever, right?

456
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,167
- Depends on the spag bol.
- Might be a really good spag bol.

457
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,086
But right now, whatever happens tonight,
wherever we end up,

458
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,970
I'm having a really good time
getting to know you.

459
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,250
And you're being really patient with me,
so thank you for that.

460
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,243
And I don't know why I brought you here.

461
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,891
It was a stupid idea
and I think we should...

462
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,611
Let's do something different.
Let's go someplace else.

463
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,241
- Tom said you liked bowling.
- I love bowling.

464
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,767
OK, so shall we have a couple more
and then hit the lanes?

Right? Am I right? Yeah.

480
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,641
- I'm gonna go get us a drink.
- OK.

481
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,806
- Nancy?
- Yeah?

482
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,166
It's Nancy Patterson.

483
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,367
- Do we know each other?
- Sean. Sean Bellamy.

484
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,091
Class 5G, Saint Andrew's Comprehensive.
'88 to '93.

485
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,848
I sat next to you in chemistry
for five years.

486
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,843
I gave you that Valentine's card
in Year 9.

487
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,763
You tore it up in front of everyone.

488
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,242
- Your mum ran me over that time.
- Oh, God. Yes, I do remember.

489
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,401
<i>Shh.</i>

490
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,966
- Erm, sorry about that.
- Oh, God, don't worry.

491
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,850
Glued it back together.
It was only about 57 pieces.

492
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,967
I meant about the car.

493
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,168
- But you were so...
- Fat. Yes.

494
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,447
- Yeah.
- That was me, big fat Sean.

495

Lord of the Pies. Emperor Boom-Boom.

496
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,806
- Now you're very...
- Yeah, I went on the 5:2 diet.

497
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,043
Five days on chocolate Nesquik.
And two days strawberry Nesquik.

498
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,283
- Oh, OK.
- I lost it all from here and from here.

499
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,283
But luckily not from here.

500
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,409
- Could I just have two beers, please?
- Hell, yeah.

501
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,203
- It's Nancy fucking Patterson.
- Shush.

502
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,650

504
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,843
- These are on me.
- OK.

505
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,364
So good to see you.

506
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,885
Thank you.

507
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,205
OK, cheers.

508
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,283
- Ah. Flirting with the barman, I see.
- What? No.

509
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,931
- Not at all, no.
- I was, like, "Whoa, competition."

510
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,651
No, I wasn't. I'm the least jealous
person you'll meet.

511
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,210
Oh, God, me, too, yeah.

512
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,327
So,

513
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,243
let's ramp this up a bit.

514
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,845
Not that I'm competitive.

515
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,451
Nancy.

516
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,083
Brought you some nachos. On the house.

517
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,527
- I've got a wheat allergy...
- No, you don't.

518
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,730
You remember this?

519
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,449
- What is it? Where'd you get that?
- In my wallet.

520
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,449
- Who took it?
- I did.

521
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,847
I don't remember you ever
being in my bedroom.

522
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,447
I wasn't in your bedroom, silly.
I was outside. In a tree.

523
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,166
- Jessica, watch and weep.
- OK.

524
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,370
Why is he calling you Jessica?
You're called Nancy.

525
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,330
- You're Nancy Patterson.
- I'm in a bit of a situation here.

526
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,085
Oh, you still use Pantene Pro-V.

527
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,130
That guy is not my boyfriend.
He's actually not even my date.

528
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,124
I sort of stole him from
underneath the clock at Waterloo

529
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,329
and I'm pretending to be the girl
he's supposed to be on a date with.

530
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,687
- So it's a bit... I don't know.
- Kinky.

531
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,410
Hey, there.

532
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,967
- How's it going? I'm Jack.
- And I am Sean.

533
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,963
- He's Sean.
- There it is.

534
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,601
- So you guys know each other?
- We just went to school together.

535
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,287
- Yeah, we're old friends.
- We're old, old friends.

536
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,170
We used to have a bit of a thing
going on.

537
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,844
- Good for you.
- It was.

538
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,604
It really wasn't that good.

539
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,330
You never forget your first.

540
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,687
Lovely to see you
after all these years.

541
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,684
- We'll take it from here.
- Hang on, Jessica.

542
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,922
Hey. What are you doing?

543
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,891
It would appear that I finally have you
over a barrel, Nancy Patterson.

544
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,282
Indeed, you are clearly not the girl
you used to be once.

545
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,321
Cool and confident. Now, stealing other
women's dates from under clocks.

546
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,131
You're working as a barman
in a novelty bowling alley so...

547
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,567
- Just as Mr Armstrong predicted.
- Who's that?

548
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,928
Our careers advisor at Saint Andrew's.
Do you not remember anything?

549
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,322
- No.
- Because I remember everything. Nancy!

550
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,201
Sean, I'm out bowling with a man who...
might actually have some potential

551
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,523
and not in just that
he's a really good bowler-type way.

552
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,251
So don't ruin it for me. Just be cool.

553
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,129
- OK, I will.
- Yeah?

554
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,807
- Uh-huh. If you give me a blow job.
- You what?

555
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,649
- Take it or leave it.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

556
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,769
Come on, wouldn't hurt.
Just a tiny little blow job.

557
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,762
And then I won't dismantle your
web of deceit, Little Miss... Muffet.

558
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,731
- Not gonna give you a blow job, so...
- Hand job? Pearl necklace?

559
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,246
- Kiss? Please. Come on.
- Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

560
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,322
I just want to fulfill
a lifelong ambition.

561
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,131
OK, OK. I'll do one kiss. OK?

562
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,770
- With tongues?
- No tongues.

563
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,286
- Oh! But in the toilets.
- Yeah, in the toilets.

564
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,010
And it has to be tonight.

565
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,402
Otherwise I won't find you again
because you have no online presence.

566
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,726
- Can I go now?
- Yes.

567
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,451
- But I'll be watching you.
- I don't doubt that.

568
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,642
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

569
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,927
It's fine, they're fine.

570
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,243
Everyone'll just get drunk
and shove them down.

571
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,845
- They will.
- Yeah?

572
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,046
Look.

573
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,124
- Ooh, blimey, they're hot.
- Any word from Nancy?

574
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,202
Not... Not exactly.

575
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,044
Oh, no. No, no.

576
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,920
But in her defence, she does have
a very good reason for her tardiness.

577
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,128
And she's right, Fran.

578
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:25,604
And who knows, maybe today will end up
being not just our anniversary.

579
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,523
Imagine that, Mum.

580
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,807
Oh, my God,
who would you worry about then?

581
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,882
Oh, Bert, you've slobbed.

582
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,645
- What? Where?
- Christ. What is this now?

583
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,404
It's hummus.

584
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,921
Take it off. Off, off, off.

585
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,891
<i>Guests.</i>

586
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,964
- Go get 'em, parents.
- Bert, shift your arse.

587
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,166
I'm going!

588
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,004
Marion, you made it!

589
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,606
I feel... l just feel like...
I feel hustled.

590
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,524
Because I won?
Are you not used to that?

591
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,251
I'm not really used
to losing at bowling.

592
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,565
Oh, can't I keep them?

593
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,166
You think it's the first time
he's heard that?

594
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,607
They're cute. Well, maybe tonight.

595
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,209
Let's not forget this.
Keep you nice and warm.

596
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,040
- Are you saving that for later?
- What?

597
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,521
Got a bit of jalapeno in your teeth.

598
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,685
You've just got a little bit of spinach
or something jammed in.

599
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,888
No, it's still there. It's...

600
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,962
Oh, my God. It's a good one.

601
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,646
OK. No, it's not, though, is it?

602
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,042
- No, it's still wedged in.
- I'm just gonna nip to the ladies.

603
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,081
I'll just stay here and I'll think about

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,331
Nice.

608
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,167
What do you want to get up to next?

609
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,562
Because I know
what I wanna get up to next.

610
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,967
I saw you were about to leave
so I took my break early.

611
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,806
Fucking hell, Sean!
Leaving? I wasn't leav...

612
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,731
Er, bye.

613
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,361
Fine. I'll put my clothes back on
and have a word with Jack about Jessica.

614
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,090
So,

615
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,925
where do you wanna land
those luscious lips?

616
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,362
- We're gonna keep the door open.
- Now you're talking.

617
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,169
Right, let's just...

618
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,441
C) I (---

619
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,722
- Sean...
- ♪ Move closer

620
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,124
- ♪ Move your body real close
- I'd prefer you didn't sing that.

621
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,531
- Will you hold my face?
- Why?

622
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,886
It'll make it more romantic.

623
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,088
I don't think this could be
any more romantic.

624
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,761
No, we said no tongues.
We said no... Hey!

625
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,330
Jessica?

626
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,845
- Hey, man.
- Jack.

627
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,844
You'd been gone awhile
so I thought I'd come and find you.

628
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,844
- This is not what you think.
- I think I'm just gonna leave.

629
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,571
- No, wait. Please, let me explain.
- You don't have to.

630
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,803
I thought we had a connection
but you still have something for Sean.

631
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,406
I'm gonna leave you
to whatever fucking weird shit...

632
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,444
Jack, Jack, Jack.
Just slide it on down to chills-ville.

633
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,961
Don't be so harsh on Nancy.

634
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,327
Who's Nancy?
Why is he calling you Nancy?

635
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,847
- Why?
- It was my other pet name for her.

636
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,241
- After Nancy Reagan.
- Nancy Sinatra.

637
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,800
- I'm gonna go.
- OK, wait, hang on.

638
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,248
Wait, Jack, let me just tell you
the truth because...

639
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,448
now is as good a time as any
just to confess.

640
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,800
Confess what?

641
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,169
The reason Sean called me Nancy
was because I'm not called Jessica

642
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,926
and the reason I'm not called Jessica
is because I'm not actually Jessica.

643
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,884
She's Nancy. She's Nancy Patterson.

644
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,407
Thank you, Sean. Can you put your
clothes back on and leave? Please.

645
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,205
- What about my kiss?
- Out. No. Jog on. Out!

646
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,770
Anyway, look, I was in here with him

647
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,322
because he said he wouldn't tell you
who I really was if I kissed him.

648
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,607
The truth is,
I'm not really your blind date.

649
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,207
You thought I was, what with the book,
the clock and the quid pro quo.

650
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,921
So you're not the girl
that I was supposed to meet earlier?

651
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,570
- No.
- What?!

652
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,405
I know! It sounds a bit mad.
But don't think of it as mad.

653
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,887
Think of it as impulsive.

654
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,042
What kind of person
stands underneath a clock

655
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,566
- waiting to steal someone's date?
- I wasn't waiting.

656
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,291
It's not stealing
in the conventional sense of the word.

657
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,091
That girl gave me her book
so that's why you thought I was her.

658
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,771
No, I thought you were her
because you said you were.

659
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,569
Did I actually say that?

660
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,769
When were you thinking of telling me
about this bizarre decision?

661
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,561
- There wasn't actually a plan.
- I'm sure there wasn't a plan.

662
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,610
Because who would have a plan
for something so fucked up?

663
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,411
I think people have done
worse things in the world.

664
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,161
- I'm racking my brains.
- That girl wasn't even right for you.

665
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,086
We'll never know. I'll never meet her
because you stole her.

666
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,243
I was merely trying to meet my mate
in the modern world.

667
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,847
- Who are you?
- I'm Nancy Patterson. Hello.

668
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,764
- Are you even a triathlete?
- That's the next thing you ask?

669
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,923
- And where's Jessica?
- Probably gone home by now.

670
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,844
- Past her bedtime.
- Are you even 24?

671
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,685
- Aw. Add another ten.
- What?

672
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,526
- Fuck you, Granddad.
- Not in six billion years.

673
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,887
- That was uncalled for.
- That was uncalled for?

674
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,849
- Yeah.
- Do you know what's uncalled for?

675
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,524
Derailing my date.

676
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,840
<i>OK.</i>

677
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,163
Laugh it up, girls. I am your future.
Just so you know.

678
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,322
<i>- 34!
- 40:</i>

679
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,971
- I think you're overreacting a bit.
- Really?

680
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,724
- Yeah.
- How would you feel, Nancy,

681
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,280
if you'd been set up
with someone perfect for you

682
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,442
and some psycho
pretends to be them instead?

683
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,609
- Setups never work.
- Tom said we matched.

684
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,082
Please, she reads self-help books
and The Da <i>Vinci</i> Code.

685
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,640
She works in the City.
What does that even mean?

686
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,210
When people say that?

687
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,250
It means she is a high-flying
24-year-old businesswoman...

688
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,005
24. You love that word.
It's your favourite word.

689
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,764
Isn't that just the classic response

690
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,162
of the lonely 34-year-old woman
desperate for somewhere to put her eggs.

691
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,005
I'm nearly at my sexual peak.
It's all downhill for you.

692
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,287
Knock knock, who's there? Viagra!

693
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,964
The bitter look really suits you.

694
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,202
It doesn't surprise me
that Pete slept around.

695
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,681
Hang on a sec. Oh, oh, oh!
There is no Pete!

696
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,922
And there is no wife
because she left you.

697
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,924
Here's your theory. You think,
"I'm so wounded and rejected."

698
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,561
"Please, help me, younger woman,
who's nearly half my age."

699
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,530
This is coming from someone
who had to steal someone else's date

700
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,647
to even get one.

701
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,849
At least I'm not walking around
like I'm bloody catch of the century.

702
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,367
Look at me with my own flat
and my online marketing management job.

703
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,250
But what I really want to do is paint.

704
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,641
- I am gonna paint. OK?
- Sure you are.

705
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,530
Thank you very much, it was lovely
not getting to know you

706
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,649
and congratulations
on your massive pack of lies.

707
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,564
- Where's my bag?
- That was all there was on the ticket.

708
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,924
- Where's my bag?
- How should I know?

709
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,365
Why have I got your notepad?

710
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,762
Oh, f... Oh, my God,
we've left my bag at the cantina.

711
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,207
Your bag, not mine.
How many tequilas have you had?

712
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,647
- My divorce papers are in there.
- Ooh, sexy.

713
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,291
- I came from the lawyers, alright?
- Sexier.

714
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,842
Your divorce papers...
and my notepad with my speech!

715
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,922
What speech?

716
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,890
It's my folks' 40th wedding anniversary
tonight.

717
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,806
It just gets better. Not only do you
steal somebody else's blind date,

718
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,441
you stand up your parents on one of the
most important milestones of their life.

719
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,042
You really, really need to consider
your motivations for doing things

720
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,884
and not doing things.

721
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,122
- I'm gonna get my speech.
- Whatever. Taxi!

722
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,602
- What are you doing?
- Calling a cab so I can go to the bar.

723
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,967
- It's a ten-minute walk.
- No, it's 20 minutes.

724
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,442
- It's ten minutes!
- You seem awfully confident, Nancy.

725
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,449
- Because it's a fact, Jack.
- It's a fact.

726
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,040
Is it a fact?
Like the fact that you're a triathlete.

727
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,088
- Great.
- Here's a good idea.

728
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,881
Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the
bar and we'll see who gets there first?

729
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,531
- What?
- You don't know what a triathlon is.

730
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,011
- Yes, I do.
- You do, do you?

731
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,367
- Yeah.
- Well, ready, steady...

732
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,764
"So!

733
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,804
Get stronger thighs!

734
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,164
Come on, come on, come on!

735
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,609
- Bye.
- Twat! Shit!

736
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,046
What?

737
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,126
No.

738
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,361
Shit.

739
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,929
Excuse me. Why so many feathers?

740
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,241
Shit!

741
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,129
Hey. Sir. Kind person.

742
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,165
Come OH, come OH, come OH.

743
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,321
Excuse me! Coming through.

744
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,129
Just go further up. It's on the left.

745
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,890
<i>Mind your</i> back!

746
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,605
In your 40-year-old face!

747
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,207
- I thought you weren't competitive.
- I thought you weren't competitive.

748
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,966
You alright?

749
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,324
It's a tactical puke.

750
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,687
- It better be in there.
- Of course it will.

751
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,567
- Hey, you want some more tequila?
- No!

752
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,007
- Is his man-bag here?
- It's a satchel, OK.

753
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,641
- I'm not used to carrying it.
- Alright, I'll go check.

754
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,688
- Where are you going?
- Toilet.

755
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,206
- You gonna meet somebody?
- No, so don't follow me.

756
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,442
I have no intention of doing that again.

757
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,086
Fuck!

758
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,010
<i>Hi, you've called Elaine.</i>

759
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,004
<i>Leave a message
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.</i>

760
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,246
Nice one, Nancy.

761
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,527
Really, really nice.

762
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,724
It's great stuff.

763
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,603
Hey, you know. New mantra.

764
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,127
Stop being such a loser.

765
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,330
How about that?

766
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,524
Er...

767
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,964
Yay.

768
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,530
- Do you even like bowling?
- I love bowling.

769
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,649
Great. So you weren't faking it
the whole night, then?

770
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,121
Bet you've said that line before.

771
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,570
Look...

772
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,367
Look, I realise
this is not my finest hour.

773
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,967
- Oh, you don't say?
- Yeah. I know.

774
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,161
In hindsight, agreeing to Sean's demands
was not the best decision

775
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,685
that I've made all evening.

776
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,651
- You could've just told me the truth.
- I know and I was going to,

777
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,291
I really was, but then...

778
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,520
..."Jessica" was doing so well.

779
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,126
One man-bag.

780
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,168
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

781
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,560
- What?
- Black Pant Wash.

782
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,170
Funky.

783
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,726
Idiot.

784
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,041
Idiot.

785
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,171
Jack?

786
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,922
What are you doing here?
I thought we agreed.

787
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,286
What are you doing here?

788
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,567
- Hello, Jack.
- Fuck off, Ed.

789
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,928
I get this place between five and 10 p.m.
on a Saturday.

790
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,128
Sorry, I thought it was a Sunday.

791
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,044
I think we all know that you know
that it's not on a Sunday.

792
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,124
Oh, how I miss that
pissy little diary of yours.

793
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,283
Do you still put an "M" in it
when it's moustache-dyeing week?

794
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,365
He didn't know. Hey, this is Nancy,
by the way. My girlfriend.

795
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,562
Nancy, this is Hilary,
my soon-to-be ex-wife,

796
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,688
and Ed, the man she left me for.

797
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,446
- Come on, Jack.
- Yeah, come on, silly me.

798
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,962
You know what? We're all in
the same bar with our new partners.

799
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,283
Let's have a drink together.
We're adults, aren't we?

800
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,966
We're mature, stable adults.

801
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,042
- Come on. Have you got a table?
- Yeah.

802
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,930
- Is it "our" table?
- Not any more.

803
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,048
Good! Even better. Lead the way.

804
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,920
- Oh, my God. What is happening?
- Just go with it, darling.

805
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,809
Just go with it, Edward.

806
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,322
Oh, my God. You knew they'd be here.
That's why you brought me here earlier.

807
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,803
That is why I brought "Jessica" here.
Then I came to my senses and we left.

808
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,611
- But then you left my bag here...
- You left your bag.

809
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,401
And then you came out of the toilets
looking like... Hmm...

810
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,569
I just thought people have done
worse things in the world

811
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,689
and you are very good at pretending
to be people that you're not.

812
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,366
And you owe me, Nancy.

813
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,726
<i>Hm.</i>

814
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,568
OK. What exactly
are you hoping to achieve?

815
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,968
I believe they call it "closure".

816
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,602
Missed a call from Nancy. She's not
even gonna make it for the speeches.

817
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,967
What the fuck do you think she's doing?

818
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,726
- What you always tell her to do.
- But not the greatest night to pick.

819
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,087
But she's being spontaneous.

820
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,766
Be spontaneous
when there's nothing else planned.

821
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,444
Don't you think this is a bit...

822
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,086
I'm gonna see what's happened
before I pass judgement.

823
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,889
Are you? Well, good for you.

824
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,089
Jesus, when has she ever done
anything like this before?

825
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,004
- Well, never, but...
- Pardon, what was that?

826
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,206
Never.

827
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,841
She's out there, somewhere,
doing you proud, meeting a man.

828
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,208
Having a lovely time.
Just like when we first met.

829
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,126
- We met in a pub.
- But it was a lovely romantic pub.

830
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,163
It was a Yates's Wine Lodge.

831
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,164
Do you remember the first thing
you ever said to me?

832
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,249
- "Vodka and tonic, please."
- And I said?

833
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,449
"Pint or a half?"

834
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,083
What is the worst-case scenario?

835
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,006
- We never see her again.
- Alright, second worst?

836
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,042
<i>Aw.</i>

837
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,530
- You hungry?
- No.

838
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,841
- Little snackette?
- No, don't need it.

839
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,160
So...

840
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,727
...how long have you two
been seeing each other?

841
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,962
- Not long.
- Not long at all.

842
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,451
How did you meet?

843
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,800
- At work.
- At a party.

844
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,042
- At a work party.
- At a party that worked.

845
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,283
<i>So you're in online marketing, too?</i>

846
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,081
No. I am a...

847
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,726
"firewoman. I'm a firewoman.

848
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,849
- There was a fire.
- At his work party.

849
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,082
And then in our pants.

850
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,769
So, Hilary, what is it that you...
What do you do for a living?

851
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,842
I'm an account manager
at a leading PR firm.

852
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,445
Mind-blowing. And you, Ed?

853
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,608
- I'm a merchant banker.
- Interesting fact.

854
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,411
"Merchant banker" is
cockney rhyming slang for "wanker".

855
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,760
Oh, for fuck's sake, Jack.

856
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,002
It's a fact. I'm just saying.
I'm not lying.

857
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,048
- It's been a year.
- It's OK, Hil.

858
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,090
It's not the first time
I've heard that one.

859
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,004
- First time I've heard it.
- I'm unaffected by it, so...

860
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,608
And it's been more than a year,
actually, Hilary. It's been 368 days.

861
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,082
Not that I'm crossing it off on
my wall calendar of pain and deceit.

862
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,571
I need a piss.

863
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,169
Oh, fuck! Shit.

864
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,883
- Oh, shit.
- Hey...

865
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,402
Hey, don't worry, Baby Cakes. This was
bound to happen sooner or later.

866
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,323
He does this. It's kind of blackmail.

867
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,328
He's a very emotional man.

868
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,970
We're gonna need more nibbles, please.
So...

869
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,846
"question.

870
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,768
- You two had an affair?
- We fell in love.

871
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,763
Yeah, but you had an affair?

872
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:09,325
- The marriage was over anyway.
- But you had an affair?

873
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,245
- Yeah.
- I guess he is just an emotional man.

874
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,884
Look, I'm sorry, Hilary.

875
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,850
- The truth is...
- I missed you, Big Nuts.

876
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,086
So what rating
are you two rabbits on now?

877
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,130
- Rating?
- Yeah, sexually speaking?

878
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,204
Because Jack and I, God,
we're still in porno land really.

879
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,884
Porno land?

880
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,531
- Hm-hmm. Shall I explain?
- Please do.

881
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,649
OK. You know when a woman
first starts sleeping with a man,

882
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,051
she acts like a porn star.

883
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,009
Am I right? Jack and I, anything goes.

884
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,527
Church of Lesbyterian, dinner beneath
the bridge, guided tour of site B,

885
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,170
if you know where that is. He knows.

886
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,528
Remember when you said we should
and I was like, "I'm not gonna do that."

887
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,284
- You said, "Go on, try it."
- Did I?

888
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,160
And I was just thinking, "I'm actually
quite scared," because I couldn't see.

889
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,766
Then, God, you flipped it.
And all of a sudden...

890
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,571
God, I felt like, "Please don't stop."

891
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,645
"Jack, please don't stop. Don't stop,
Jack. Do what you do, Jack."

892
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,961
"Thank you, Jack.
I love your work, Jack."

893
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,965
And you lot are like, "Wow, our sex life
is always gonna be like a porn film."

894
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,362
Six months in, the ladies,
we drop it down to an 18,

895
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,001
and then a 15, maybe a quick 69
but only if we've just had a bath.

896
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,927
And then suddenly, whoa, we're a PG-13
wearing tartan pyjamas to bed

897
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,641
doing the goodnight rollover before
you can say "missionary position".

898
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,728
That is a brilliant theory.

899
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,407
Thank you. But do you know what, Jack?
I really feel

900
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,570
like we're gonna be in porno land
for a lot longer than usual.

901
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,451
- I have a theory, too.
- Yeah? What is it?

902
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,087
If you get a woman back to your place
and you say you don't wanna have sex,

903
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,882
you just wanna take it slowly,
I guarantee she will go down on you.

904
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,849
- The Blow Job Paradox.
- Blow Job Paradox!

905
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,083
- Yeah! "Use it, don't abuse it."
- If divorce papers were honest,

906
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,561
they wouldn't say
"irreconcilable differences".

907
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,325
- They'd say "not enough blow jobs".
- Not enough blowjobs!

908
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,528
Like, get down there, fix it.

909
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,446
Sorry to interrupt. Did you
get a chance to sign those papers?

910
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,367
Yes, I did, actually, Hilary. In fact,
coincidentally, I have them with me.

911
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,161
Although, stupid Jack,
I signed them with a pen.

912
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,210
You'd probably prefer it
if I did it with my own blood.

913
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,324
Hey, this is our song. We should dance.
It's very special. Isn't that mad?

914
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,327
Don't fucking touch me.

915
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,890
- Yay.
- What are you doing?

916
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,962
Stopping you from making
a twat of yourself

917
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,008
by using the medium of dance. Hello.

918
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,765
I'm gonna slow-dance you
into submission, OK?

919
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,367
You'll need to put your arms around
my waist for it to work properly. Good.

920
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,125
- I'm such a dick.
- You're not. You're not a dick.

921
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,044
It's always better
to be the one that's dumped.

922
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,646
You never regret anything.
She made the decision.

923
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,007
She's gotta live with that
for the rest of her life.

924
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,562
- It's not as simple as that, is it?
- But it will be. It just takes time.

925
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,440
- Your hands are slipping down my arse.
- Sorry. Old habit.

926
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,170
Everybody knew they were doing it.
Nobody told me.

927
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,129
It's rough. I'll admit it's rough.

928
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,690
I was really traditional about

929
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,525
the whole "don't sleep around
when you're married" thing.

930
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,602
Hands-arse. That's right.

931
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,570
I bet you proposed
on the top of a Tuscan hill.

932
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,210
Cephalonian, actually.

933
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,089
Spent a year planning your big day.

934
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,924
- Twenty grand, all in?
- Bit more.

935
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,367
- Let's not forget the ring.
- It was four grand.

936
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,284
And we had to get it resized
because she got awfully thin.

937
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,842
You spent £24,000
on a party and some jewellery?

938
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,001
It was a grand gesture.

939
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,811
What's the point of life
if you're not up for stuff like that?

940
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,566
A grand gesture that amounted
to nothing. Hands-arse.

941
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,162
- God, you're such a fucking cynic.
- And you're such a fucking romantic.

942
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,604
You put so much emphasis on that one day
and forget about the rest of your life.

943
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,365
What's wrong with having a big day?
Look at your parents.

944
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,011
I bet they had a party and guests
and a wishing tree.

945
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,203
Six guests. Local registry office.
Drinks at the pub afterwards.

946
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,964
They decided it was more important

947
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,327
to concentrate on the promises
they were making.

948
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,681
Don't you think that's what I wanted?

949
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,240
When you get married,
you make a promise you can't keep,

950
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,051
but, by God, I was gonna try,
and I'll never regret that.

951
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,565
Which is more than you can say,

952
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,689
sat up there on your single perch
with all your judgements.

967
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,688
You spend your entire time on the
sidelines theorising about what works,

968
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,764
but never putting yourself out there.
You never take chances.

969
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,684
I think my actions today
could be considered quite "chancy".

970
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,171
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

971
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,564
You need to man up. I married that
woman and she tore out my heart

972
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,763
but I'm still standing.
I'm still putting myself out there.

973
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,411
And who are you to say
that my marriage was doomed?

974
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,568
Who are you to say
that the girl I met tonight,

975
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,883
the girl I was supposed to meet tonight,
wasn't the girl of my dreams?

976
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,885
You need to let me get on
with my sad single-man life crisis

977
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,931
and keep your cynical wisecracks

00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,923

- No.

Come on.

00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,321
Just go to your party,
Nancy, I'm fine.

985
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,643
- You're fine?
- Yeah, I'm really fucking fine.

986
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,086

Sorry. You didn't lock. Didn't lock.

<i>Hi.</i>

989
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,247
I was hoping
for the pants-and-socks look.

990
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,283
Nice place you got. It's really cosy.

991
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,761
Sorry.

992
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:09,086
I've had a bad relationship run
over the past few years

993
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,722
and so it's made me
not the most positive person.

994
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,846
I overanalyse and I...

995
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,808
...come up with elaborate theories and
make monumentally bad decisions and...

996
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,566
I've gotta move on, you know,
that's all.

997
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,847
She's out there, she's happy.

998
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,048
She's getting on with her life
and I'm...

999
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,765
...I’m just holding on.
- OK.

1000
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,602
A, I wouldn't say "happy", exactly.

1001
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,844
And secondly, I mean,
you're not holding on to her.

1002
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,843
You're holding on to a feeling

1003
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,561
and that feeling will eventually pass.
Promise.

1004
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,850
I mean, look, maybe I was wrong.

1005
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,642
Maybe dating 24-year-olds
is exactly what you need right now.

1006
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,530
- You've changed your tune.
- Well, unlike...

1007
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,131
...the older lady,
they do have less baggage.

1008
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,281
I mean, shit, I'm way over
my baggage allowance.

1009
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,125
I'm four years single.
Four fucking years.

1010
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,201
Prior to that, I had six years
with the supposed love of my life,

1011
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,124
when, out of the blue,
he ended it and then he...

1012
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,044
He said he wanted to go to China
to find himself.

1013
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,600
Then he found himself
shacked up in Shepherd's Bush

1014
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,648
with some other girl six months later.

1015
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,724
- I'm over it, obviously, but I just...
- Yeah, you really sound it.

1016
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,725
Apart from one thing.

1017
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,566
One thing that, honestly,
I'm not sure that I can ever get over.

1018
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,880
What?

1019
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,200
He...

1020
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,087
He de-authorised me from his iTunes.

1021
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,051
What? That is unforgivable.

1022
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,320
It is. It is, actually.

1023
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,045
So, what do you really do for a living?

1024
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,361
I'm a journalist. Yeah.

1025
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,569
Slash wannabe literary polymath.

1026
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,167
- That figures. You got good theories.
- Oh, you like them now?

1027
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,844
I wouldn't listen to me, though,

1028
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,766
because I'm not exactly the poster child
for the dating industry.

1029
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,969
Really? I'm 40, divorced
and crying in a toilet.

1030
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,644
You're just...

1031
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,247
You're an emotional jigsaw at the moment

1032
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,846
but you're gonna piece yourself
back together.

1033
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,163
You know, start with the corners.
Look for the blue bits.

1034
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,850
And where do I find these "blue bits"?

1035
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,002
Took me three years
to get over my ex.

1036
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,120
Jungian therapy.
Two hours every day. Six weeks.

1037
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,363
I burnt her clothes. Twice.

1038
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,920
I'm not saying
that her porn star theory is correct.

1039
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,525
But you did blow job paradox me?

1040
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,524
Hey. Where did you two get to?

1041
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,921
Probably 69-ing in the toilets,
no doubt.

1042
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,765
Who's up for a shot?
Let's do some shots.

1043
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,003
- I think I've had enough to drink.
- We're just gonna head off.

1044
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,004
Nonsense. It's a seminal night
so we should mark it somehow.

1045
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,889
Four sambucas, please.

1046
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,201
You look like you've been crying.

1047
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,726
- Actually, I was crying.
- With laughter.

1048
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,246
Have you ever tried to do it
in a cubicle that small?

1049
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,130
I think I left my knickers in there.

1050
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,124
She does not need to know
the real reason for your tears.

1051
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,328
Did you wanna
leave your knickers in there?

1052
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,640
Focus, Jack.

1053
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,004
Repeat after me.

1054
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,926
"After this shot I will be stronger,
wiser and finally moving on."

1055
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,050
After this shot I will be stronger,
wiser and finally moving on.

1056
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,361
- Fuck the past.
- Fuck the past.

1057
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,009
Sorry_

1058
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,649
- Oh, my God.
- Do something!

1059
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,451
You're a fireman,
put the fucking fire out!

1060
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,642
- Here. You take it.
- Jesus!

1061
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,328
That is what I call closure.

1062
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,244
I think that's the dictionary definition
right there.

1063
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,449
Denial, depression, acceptance.

1064
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,050
- Fire.
- Fire.

1065
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,724
What?

1066
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,290
Alright, what is next?

1067
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,284
- OK, what's the time?
- It is ten o'clock.

1068
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,842
Is it? Oh, shit.
I should check in at home, really.

1069
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,570
Yeah, I'd better...

1070
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,607
So, I think I'd better finally head
to my folks' anniversary party

1071
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,284
but I was just...

1072
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,442
This is a crazy idea
but I was just thinking,

1073
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,324
- would you want to join...?
- Sorry.

1074
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,247
Just because it might be nice to not
go alone for a change and if you...

1075
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,042
Oh, my God, she has called
and texted, like, a lot.

1076
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,724
- Who has?
- Jessica.

1077
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,770
She said she spoke to Tom
and there's obviously been

1078
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,650
some sort of misunderstanding
and she still wants to meet up.

1079
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,927
Even though you stood her up?
Ls she a loser?

1080
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,765
Technically, you stood her up, actually.

1081
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:14,050
She's young so she's not
a total cynic like you. Us. Yet.

1082
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,168
Your 24-year-old obsession, isn't it?

1083
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,083
You said I should keep it simple.

1084
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,289
- When?
- Like, half an hour ago in the toilet.

1085
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,246
So, what is your theory on this one?

1086
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,211
- My theory?
- Yeah, I wanna hear it. What's the...

1087
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,681
ls it "boy meets girl"
or "boy doesn't meet girl"?

1088
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,529
I mean...

1089
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,331
This is when you tell me what to do
and then we argue and then...

1090
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,529
You know, it's a bit of back and forth
and eventually...

1091
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,331
- Oh, wait.
- What for?

1092
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,210
All night you've had
all these theories and opinions

1093
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,009
and suddenly you've nothing to say?

1094
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,163
What do you want? Do you want
my permission or something?

1095
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,006
- No, not at all.
- Then I think you should meet Jessica.

1096
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,641
- Yeah, but that's not...
- What are you waiting for, right?

1097
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,042
What am l...? I don't know
what I'm waiting for.

1098
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,451
Fine, I'll meet Jessica.

1099
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,449
- OK. Great.
- OK.

1100
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,929
- Are you meeting her here or...
- Yeah. Yes, there it is.

1101
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,286
- OK.
- That's where the...

1102
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,601
You can give her this back then.

1103
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,651
- No, she bought another one.
- Course she did.

1104
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,769
I haven't really read it, to be honest.

1105
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,330
Maybe we should have.

1106
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,845
So, erm...

1107
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,085
- ls that everything?
- Yeah.

1108
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,531
So sorry for derailing your date.

1109
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,367
I'm glad you did, otherwise I'd have
nothing to talk about on the next one.

1110
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,569
It is a good anecdote.
I'll probably use it in future myself.

1111
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,120
So, well, look after yourself...

1112
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,010
- It's what I do best.
- OK, and...

1113
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,525
- Bye.
- Bye.

1114
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,326
- I'll Facebook you.
- Not on Facebook.

1115
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,244
- Idiot.
- Idiot.

1116
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,124
Idiot.

1117
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,966
Idiot.

1118
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,250
What kind of nutter pretends to be
someone else's blind date?

1119
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,890
I know. It's...

1120
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,726
Although it does prove what a publishing
sensation Six Billion has been.

1121
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,881
Yeah.

1122
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,124
Let's just pretend the whole thing
never happened and we shall start again.

1123
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,361
Cheers.

1124
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,410
Sorry, I'm ever so thirsty.
I did a lot of walking today.

1125
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,606
So, Jessica,
I hear you work in the City.

1126
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,889
- Correct. And I love it.
- "Lunch is for wimps."

1127
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,922
It's from Wall Street. From the film.

1128
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,162
"If you need a friend, get a dog."

1129
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,449
Oh, is that the one
with Leonardo DiCaprio?

1130
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,686
Er, no.

1131
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,160
Erm, so listen, Tom told me
that you are a triathlete.

1132
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,441
Bert, are you ready? Yeah?

1133
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,800
- Alright?
- Yep.

1134
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,727
Attention!

1135
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,210
<i>Attention.</i>

1136
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,281
<i>Attenzione</i>.

1137
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,600
Oi! Come on.

1138
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,648
Adam, thank you.

1139
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,729
Well, here we all are.

1140
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:19,087
I had rather hoped that
our youngest daughter, Nancy,

1141
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,162
would have been here to do the speech.

1142
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,642
But, er, she's been a little delayed.

1143
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,767
So it falls to myself...

1144
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,207
...to find a few choice words.

1145
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,446
But, I mean, seriously...

1146
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,682
...what's left for us to say
to each other after 40 years?

1147
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,842
Take the fucking recycling out.

1148
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,601
Still as foul-mouthed
as the day I met her.

1149
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,930
And still as beautiful.

1150
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,126
<i>Aw!</i>

1151
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:59,721
And although I doubt that we have
another 40 years ahead of us...

1152
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,564
Bloody hope not.

1153
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,722
...or we will ever agree...

1154
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,808
...that you can park on
a double yellow line on a Sunday...

1155
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,326
- But you can, actually.
- Whose side are you on?

1156
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,121
...or she will ever fully trust me
with the big weekly shop...

1157
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,964
Not a hope in hell.

1158
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,647
...but here's to spending...

1159
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,685
...whatever years we have left
together.

1160
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,807
<i>Aw!</i>

1161
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,881
<i>Franny,“</i>

1162
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,561
...l am an empty shell on the beach
without you.

1163
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,721
Oh, that's good.

1164
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,522
I am a laundry disaster
waiting to happen.

1165
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,803
Lam an old pear...

1166
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,725
...left to soften in the fruit bowl.

1167
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,089
Oh, here she is.

1168
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,647
Nancy!

1169
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,930
So sorry I'm late. But I remembered
the chocolate mousse.

1170
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,011
Oh...

1171
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,402
- What is it, darling? What is it?
- What's up?

1172
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,329
- What's the matter?
- It's OK.

1173
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,606
Oh...

1174
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,604
Come on, tell us,
what's the matter, darling?

1175
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,407
I got a lot of big
home-improvement plans.

1176
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,807
Do up my flat.
I'm gonna paint my hallway.

1177
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,770
Yes, Tom said that
you were a bit of an artiste.

1178
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,571
Yeah, I, you know... I dabble.

1179
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,802
No, I don't dabble.
Who am I trying to kid?

1180
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,769
I got an A in art at A level.

1181
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,241
I don't remember
what I got in my A levels.

1182
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,128
I'm kidding you. I'm not that old.

1183
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,202
I got two Bs and a C, so.

1184
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,328
No, I didn't. I got two Cs and a B.

1185
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,122
Anyway, I passed them all, so.

1186
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,726
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1187
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,647
Anyway, I'm so glad that you're a fan
of Six Billion People <i>and</i> You as well.

1188
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,848
And I'm so sorry that
I was late to meet you.

1189
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,764
But, actually, the reason
that I had to buy another copy

1190
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,889
was because I left my copy
for this woman on the train

1191
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,249
and she so needed to read it.
She was a very unhappy soul.

1192
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:06,689
You know, one of those sort of "lost
hope", "clock ticking" kind of women.

1193
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,720
- Anyway, shall we do the lists?
- Yes, the lists, the lists.

1194
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,043
I can't wait to see
what your favourite food is.

1195
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,726
Ready?

1196
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,406
I am so sorry about this.

1197
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,648
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

1198
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,805
If I hadn't left her that book...
It's like the most epic love story ever.

1199
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,202
And it means that I was right
and she was wrong. Taxi!

1200
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,121
- Where to?
- Shit, I have no idea.

1201
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,281
Just call her.

1202
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,442
I don't have her number.
I have your number.

1203
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,881
- What's her name?
- Nancy. Nancy Patterson.

1204
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,361
- Look her up on Facebook.
- She's not on Facebook.

1205
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,363
Don't be ridiculous.

1206
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,081
Everyone's connected. You'll have
some mutual friends or something.

1207
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,605
You bloody genius.

1208
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,209
Bloomsbury Bowling Lanes, please.

1209
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,443
Good luck with the triathleting.
Thank you, Jessica!

1210
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,366
- Sean... ls that my scarf?
- Where's Nancy?

1211
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,569
I have to find her
and I think she's at her parents'.

1212
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,210
Do you know where they live?

1213
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,804
I know the exact
Google map coordinates.

1214
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,167
Holy... You know what, Sean?
I'd be quite happy to take the train.

1215
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,402
- What's your plan?
- What's my plan?

1216
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,045
To win her heart.

1217
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,200
- This isn't a power ballad.
- Well, it should be.

1218
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,523
Grand romantic gestures.
That's what it's all about.

1219
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,969
Declarations. Heart on the line.
Life-changing kind of stuff.

1220
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,044
That's what I was going for
back there in the toilets.

1221
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,203
Actions, you know. More than words.

1222
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,730
Jesus!

1223
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,529
Taught myself to drive
with just my left hand.

1224
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,367
Pretty useful, I can tell you.

1225
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,886
- Are we here?
- Yep, we're here.

1226
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,645
OK, OK, OK. Erm...

1227
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,167
- Oh, what number is it?
- 74.

1228
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,361
<i>Go, go, go! Bon chance, mon amigo.</i>

1229
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,930
Whoo!

1230
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,609
Idiot, idiot, idiot...

1231
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,284
I should have just said...

1232
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,840
"Don't go,
come with me to the party."

1233
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,126
I can't hear her.

1234
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,680
Go easy, Nancy, it is a partition wall.

1235
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,127
- Something about a party?
- This party?

1236
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,567
And I was gonna bring him here
and everything.

1237
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,846
The man on the phone?

1238
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,649
The strange man
you were on a date with?

1239
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,449
- You should have.
- Didn't go well?

1240
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,403
No, it did go really well.

1241
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,608
- Oh, no, it's not a good thing.
- Boo, boo.

1242
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,686
Come on, my lovely,
just tell us what happened.

1243
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,171
<i>OK.</i>

1244
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,641
- I'll get that.
- OK. So...

1245
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,562
- What are you doing here?
- Ls Nancy here?

1246
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,210
Are you the strippergram?

1247
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,248
What? No, I'm not. What are you...?

1248
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,563
- Nancy, I had to come and find you.
- How did you...?

1249
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,326
- I couldn't just leave it like that.
- Oh, my God. Nancy, is this...

1250
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,006
- Oh, it's marvellous.
- We've got a chair for you.

1251
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,889
- A chair? For me?
- Yeah.

1252
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,009
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Hello, nice to see you.

1253
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:59,406
- We've got a lot of people here.
- Oh, party time. Hello, everybody.

1254
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,683
Hello, I'm Sean.
Ooh, strawberries. Favourite!

1255
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,569
I loves me strawberries.

1256
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,721
No.

1257
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,123
Everybody, everyone!

1258
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,168
Everybody, everybody!

1259
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:15,083
- This is...
- It's Jack!

1260
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,686
He's looking for...
Who are you looking for again?

1261
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,967
Nancy. Ls this a 40th party?

1262
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,044
Nancy! Nancy, are you here?

1263
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,327
- I'm Nancy.
- I'm Nancy.

1264
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,085
I'm Nancy!

1265
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,004
No, no, no, no, no, you're not.
None of you are Nancy.

1266
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,924
Nancy is 34, not 15 or whatever.

1267
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,129
There's a girl being sick in the sink.
This is terrible.

1268
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,205
Come here, sweetheart. Let it all out.
There you go.

1269
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:47,047
Listen, Nancy is... she's got
very cool hair and a lovely face and...

1270
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,886
Come on, please. Nancy Patterson.
Anybody help me with Nancy Patterson?

1271
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,446
Wait! Nancy Patterson?

1272
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:56,245
- Yes!
- She used to be my old baby-sitter.

1273
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,210
- Can you take me to her?
- Yes, I can.

1274
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,691

01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,924
your attention, please.

1296
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,769
I'm just... just gonna say
a few words. Er...

1297
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,691
Er, I actually had
something prepared but...

1298
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,331
I lost it. It's kind of a long story...

1299
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,289
Actually, I'm just gonna tell you,

1300
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,408
cos it's actually the reason
I was so late

1301
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,046
and the reason why this speech
is gonna be so rubbish.

1302
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,885
I met a man today.

1303
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,770
- Hello.
- No, not this man.

1304
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,684
I was standing underneath
the clock at Waterloo Station

1305
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,762
when a man called Jack

1306
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,605
mistook me for his blind date

1307
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,603
and instead of just saying,

1308
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,924
"Hey, you got the wrong girl,"
like a normal person, erm...

1309
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:40,125
...l thought it was a good idea
to just pretend that I was his date.

1310
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,123
<i>No, you didn't?</i>

1311
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,522
I did. I did. But, but...

1312
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,003
You know, we went out and, you know,
for the first time in ages,

1313
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,289
I put myself out there,
and I took a chance,

1314
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,930
and I even got stronger thighs.

1315
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,725
Then Jack found out
I wasn't who I said I was,

1316
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,246
a 24-year-old triathlete by the way.

1317
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,890
<i>24?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

1318
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,770
And so he went to go
and meet his real blind date.

1319
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,888
So blah, blah, blah, the end.

1320
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,290
No, don't be sad. God, I'm not sad.

1321
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,241
I'm a bit sad.

1322
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,166
Er, but I'm also quite proud of myself
because I tried.

1323
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,687
And, you know,
no, it didn't work out, but...

1324
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,561
I got a hint of what
could be out there for me.

1325
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,005
You know...

1326
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,604
...a fun...

1327
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,321
...loving, crazy, contradictory,

1328
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,051
long, happy life with someone.

1329
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,929
Something that these two have had

1330
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,527
since they first laid eyes on each other
40 years ago.

1331
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,090
So, please...

1332
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,851
...join me in toasting them and
wishing them a very happy anniversary.

1333
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,523
To my mum and dad. To Bert and Fran.

1334
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,604
- Mum and Dad.
- Bert and Fran.

1335
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,761
Bert and Fran.

1336
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,047
I liked that speech. I liked it a lot.

1337
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,246
Cheers, Dad.

1338
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,164
- Much better than last year's.
- Yeah, that wasn't very...

1339
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,730
Come here.

1340
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,565
Stronger thighs. I'm so proud of you.

1341
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,281
Cheers, Elaine.

1342
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,249
Just keep on going, my darling.

1343
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,561
- You'll get there in the end.
- Thanks, Mummy.

1344
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,881
<i>So where's this Jack now'?</i>

1345
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,611
<i>He's at the window.</i>

1346
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,886
Nancy!

1347
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,769
Nancy, it's me. Nancy! Nanc...

1348
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,604
I'm gonna... I'm coming in.

1349
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,731
Sorry. Sorry.

1350
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,125
Hey.

1351
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,326
Nancy, I thought
you might want your speech.

1352
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,329
It's too late. I've...

1353
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:07,803
- No, do you want your speech, Nancy?
- Er... Yes.

1354
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,963
OK, good. Just be quiet
and let me give it to you, then.

1355
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,362
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

1356
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,562
...erm, and friends
and members of Nancy's family

1357
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,201
who I've never met before in my life.
This is...

1358
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,649
I met a girl today, the wrong girl,

1359
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,530
except she turned out
to be the right girl.

1360
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,080
And this girl who took a chance on me

1361
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,323
in the most bizarre
and romantic way possible

1362
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,449
wanted me to take a chance on her,
but, erm...

1363
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,363
...l didn't, you know. I didn't.
I blew it,

1364
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,809
like a stupid 40-year-old,
mid-life-crisis dickhead that I am.

1365
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,327
Which is why I sought help
from old beaus.

1366
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,371
Yes, you... not the most reliable
of sources, really. Whatever.

1367
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,525
But undeterred, I commandeered
these brilliant young drunks,

1368
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,763
because nothing was gonna stop me
from finding this girl

1369
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,844
and telling her what
I should have told her earlier on.

1370
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:13,569
Nancy, I am so bloody glad
you pretended to be my date today,

1371
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,244
because, if you hadn't,

1372
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:20,008
then I never would've heard
any of your amazing sex theories

1373
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,881
or... watched you trying to get
jalapeno out of your teeth

1374
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,204
or witnessed your very instinctive
firewoman skills.

1375
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:35,003
I would never have got to know
that muddy, beautiful triathlete face

1376
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,926
or witnessed that awesome,
highly competitive arse

1377
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,048
as you were about to get another strike.

1378
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,602
In fact, if you hadn't have
pretended to be my date today,

1379
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,411
my day would have been utterly rubbish.

1380
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,646
And so, quite possibly,

1381
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,200
would have been the rest of my life.

1382
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,601
Don't make those noises,
I'm right on the edge.

1383
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,202
Nancy, you said
I was an emotional jigsaw

1384
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,760
and that I should look
for the blue bits.

1385
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,526
I think you might be the blue bits,
Nancy.

1386
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,844
So what do you say?

1387
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,130
Quid pro quo?

1388

<i>What does it say in
Six Billion People and You?</i>

1389
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,524
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

1390
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,889
