00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:50,406
"...just as Eliza
was majestically removing..."

3
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:55,282
"...a fifty-pound banknote
from the drawer to her own purse..."

4
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,371
"...we were suddenly interrupted
by old MacDonald himself!"

5
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:05,157
"We called up all the winning dignity
of our sex to do what must be done."

6
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,831
"Sophia shrieked and fainted, and
I screamed and instantly ran mad."

7
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:16,326
"Finally, we regained our senses,
escaped and hastened to London."

8
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:19,705
"We began to think
of returning to our mothers,"

9
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:23,448
"but accidentally heard
that they had both..."

10
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,499
"...starved to death!"

11
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,035
Fanny!

12
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,743
Goodbye, Susy.

13
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,869
Think of lots of good stories for me
and eat thousands of tarts.

14
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:38,870
And you, little girl, continue to brush
your hair, but not all off.

15
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,448
Fanny, he's here.

16
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:49,574
Wake up.
Say goodbye to your sister.

17
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,371
- Sorry for the delay.
- Hurry along, then.

18
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:06,454
- Goodbye!
- Come on, I ain't got all day.

19
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,197
- Bye!
- Goodbye, Mama.

20
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,324
- Give my regards to my sisters.
- Yes, Mama.

21
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:17,073
And you will write to tell me
when I'm to return?

22
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,531
Mama?

23
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,326
Get on now!

24
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,623
- Bye!
- Bye, Susy!

25
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,456
Bye!

26
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,289
Bye!

27
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,746
Do you hear that?

28
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,742
Black cargo, Miss.

29
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,371
- Black cargo?
- Aye. Slaves.

30
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,617
Probably some captain
or heroic ship doctor...

31
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,577
...brought home some darkies
as gifts for the wife.

32
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,493
Get on there!

33
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:24,447
Stand!

34
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,700
Hello!

35
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,617
- Hello!
- It's 5 o'clock in the morning.

36
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,325
A Mrs. Norris arranged
for this girl to be brought here.

37
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:43,160
- It's her niece or something.
- Mrs. Norris lives in the parsonage.

38
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,954
I was told to drop her
at the entrance of Mansfield Park.

39
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,204
Then drop her.

40
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:18,907
- You must be my aunt, Aunt Norris.
- Yes, yes...

41
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,242
He brought you two hours too early.

42
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,372
Come in.

43
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,326
Ellis, gather up the children.

44
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:37,410
Now, let us have a look at you.

45
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,873
Well... I'm sure you have other qualities.

46
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,779
Sir Thomas, she's here.
Our new little charge.

47
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,204
- Hello, Fanny.
- Hello, Sir Thomas.

48
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:52,996
- Greetings from my family.
- Thank you. How was your journey?

49
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,910
Lovely, sir.
I'd no idea England was so big.

50
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,874
But you came, what?
A hundred miles?

51
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,698
- Yes, sir. Impressive.
- Indeed, it is.

52
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:07,907
Well, get her settled in with you,
and we'll introduce the children later.

53
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,578
With Mr. Norris and myself?

54
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,909
- Yes... I thought...
- No, no, no.

55
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,032
There's been a misunderstanding.

56
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,698
When I suggested
we take in my poor niece...

57
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:22,915
Please do not trouble yourself
on my behalf.

58
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,658
You speak when you are spoken to.

59
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,198
Would you excuse us, Miss Price?

60
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:18,947
Good morning.
I am Maria Elizabeth Bertram.

61
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:23,575
And I am Julia Frances Bertram.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

62
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,031
Pleased to meet you.

63
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:40,082
Mr. Norris could no more tolerate
the noise of a child than he could fly!

64
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:44,285
But it might not be wise to have her
in the house with the boys.

65
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,999
If you breed her up with them, though
she may have the beauty of an angel,

66
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,329
she'll never be more to either
than a sister.

67
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,540
I suppose there's truth to that.
It's settled.

68
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,496
Maria, Julia, listen...

69
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:05,705
We must prepare ourselves
for gross ignorance,

70
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:09,910
some meanness of opinion
and a certain vulgarity of manner.

71
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,498
- These aren't incurable faults.
- I hope she won't tease my Pug.

72
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,536
I've just persuaded Julia
to leave him alone.

73
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,831
But you girls must never be
arrogant towards her.

74
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,116
She is not your equal.

75
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,118
But that must never be apparent to her.

76
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,457
- It is a point of great delicacy.
- Great delicacy, yes.

77
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:37,784
Dining parlour through there.
Conservatory there. Cellars there.

78
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:43,326
I hope you don't tend toward sulkiness.
Your mother had the inclination.

79
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,742
Clearly marrying to disoblige her family.

80
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,450
That's the west wing.

81
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:54,205
Soon to be repaired if Tom could
set aside his horses and dice!

82
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,538
The billiard room.
For the men, of course.

83
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,783
Remember there is moderation
in all things.

84
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,863
Yes... Tom did it of himself.

85
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:08,449
Very modern...
Very modern...

86
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:13,290
Sir Thomas' extraordinary library.
Come along, we haven't got all day.

87
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,249
And here is Sir Thomas' study.

88
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,200
Never disturb him here.

89
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,249
He's weighed down with some great cares.

90
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,828
This is his personal sanctuary.

91
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:27,324
The maids' rooms.
Manservants' rooms down there.

92
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:29,828
You will be my assistant, you understand.

93
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:33,786
And here, what was formerly
the nursery and the governor's room,

94
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,041
is now your very own room!

95
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,823
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

96
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,163
How long am I expected to remain here?

97
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,247
That depends, doesn't it?

98
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,373
But if all goes well... for ever.

99
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:23,988
"Dear Susy, it seems
that Mother has given me away."

100
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:29,742
"And I can augur nothing but misery
from all I've seen at Mansfield Park."

101
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,530
Don't worry. I'm all for crying.
It makes your hair grow.

102
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,582
Don't make fun of me.

103
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,124
Is it working?

104
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,904
- Is what working?
- My behaviour.

105
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,870
- Is it making you feel better?
- It's certainly distracting.

106
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,832
Good...
Anyway, I'm Edmund.

107
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,575
So, who do you miss?

108
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:14,327
"I told Edmund
about you especially, Susy."

109
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:18,157
"He asked me if I wished to write to you.
I said I had no paper."

110
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:24,372
"And didn't he give me enough for more
stories than you should ever want!"

111
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,117
"By the way,
Eliza eloped to Paris with her lover."

112
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,331
"Unfortunately,
she lived beyond her means"

113
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:50,080
"and was imprisoned and partially
eaten by her two young sons."

114
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,862
"But she intends
to murder the guards."

115
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:56,993
"I'll keep you abreast
of any further developments."

116
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,160
"PS..."

117
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:05,993
"Could you please assure Mother
that I am improving myself daily?"

118
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:11,243
The history of England.

119
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,951
Henry VI.

120
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,453
It was in this reign
that Joan of Arc lived

121
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:19,416
and made such a fuss among the English.

122
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,121
They should not have burnt her,
but they did.

123
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,532
Henry VIII...

124
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,997
I'll save you the task of hearing
what you've already heard,

125
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:34,617
and myself of recounting
what I do not perfectly recollect,

126
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,374
justice and duty...

127
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,411
That disgrace to humanity,
that pest of society, Elizabeth,

128
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,078
who, murderess and wicked queen
that she was,

129
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:47,617
confined her cousin, the lovely
Mary, Queen of Scots, for 19 years,

130
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:52,574
and then brought her to an untimely,
unmerited and scandalous death.

131
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:57,698
Much to the eternal shame of the
monarchy and the entire kingdom.

132
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:12,034
"By a partial, prejudiced
and ignorant historian."

133
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,283
- Fanny, you're awful!
- All those wars!

134
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,664
The men all good for nothing,
and hardly any women at all.

135
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,498
Very tiresome.

136
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:25,282
It's odd that history should be so dull.
A great deal of it must be invention.

137
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,869
I shall have to bend your supple mind
in more strict a fashion.

138
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,615
I think the situation calls for some...

139
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,907
...Shakespeare!

140
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:53,577
Fanny Price!
Please try to act with some decorum!

141
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,157
What?

142
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,907
What?

143
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,116
So you like her?

144
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:54,741
Mrs. Shakespeare, she's my refuge.
I can't thank you enough.

145
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,866
My gifts are nothing next to yours.

146
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,283
My writing is wood
compared to your wild constructions.

147
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,707
Yes, I'm a wild beast!
I'm sure Sir Thomas would agree.

148
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,416
Don't concern yourself with his gravity.
He has much to preoccupy him.

149
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,911
Such as?

150
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,575
Edmund!

151
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:18,280
- It's complex.
- And I'm too simple?

152
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,827
Fanny!

153
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:23,075
He regrets taking me in, doesn't he?

154
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,164
No, it's...

155
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:30,120
It's just it's problems with the slaves
on the plantation.

156
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:34,457
- The abolitionists are making inroads.
- That's a good thing, isn't it?

157
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:40,115
Well, we all live off the profits, Fanny.

158
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,371
Including you.

159
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,908
Tom, you mustn't be serious!

160
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,621
Come back!

161
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,282
Tom!

162
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,749
You will do as I say!

163
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,079
What, and do as you do?

164
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:08,155
Even I have principles, sir!

165
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,914
Tom!

166
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,533
You are an angel.

167
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,291
Tom!

168
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,659
"Dear Susy,
news items..."

169
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,122
"Sir Thomas has dragged Tom
to the West Indies to..."

170
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,331
"...protect our interests there."

171
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:43,121
"Maria has found herself a fiancé,
a Mr. Rushworth,"

172
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,331
"who Sir Thomas
has approved by post."

173
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,824
"Everyone seems delighted with him,
except Edmund, who says,"

174
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:54,664
"'If he had not L12,000 a year,
we'd think him prodigiously dim."'

175
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:59,331
"Consequently, there's an urgency
for Julia to search for a suitor."

176
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,535
"And Mrs. Norris' husband died..."

177
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,957
"...which did not seem
to inconvenience her at all."

178
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:11,990
"She's moved into Mansfield proper,
where life is decidedly less expensive."

179
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,574
"What joy is mine!
So..."

180
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:21,326
"Now there is a new parson
moved into the parsonage, and..."

181
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:27,491
"...life seems nothing more than
a quick succession of busy nothings."

182
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,205
They are half-brother and -sister
to the parson's wife.

183
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:35,078
Entertain them with suitable
attention and animation.

184
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,910
Not to mention alacrity!

185
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:42,866
I might need the rest of the morning
to recover from the ball last night.

186
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:47,575
- I'm just a mite sluggish.
- Indeed!

187
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,541
Mr. Russel, if you please!

188
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:15,249
May I introduce Miss Mary Crawford?

189
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:24,282
And her brother, Mr. Henry Crawford.

190
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,290
This is my sister, Lady Bertram.

191
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,415
Mr. Edmund Bertram.

192
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:41,409
This is Miss Julia Bertram,
who's just come out into society,

193
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:47,243
as Miss Maria Bertram, here, has just
become engaged to Mr. Rushworth.

194
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,953
Perhaps you passed Mr. Rushworth's
magnificent estate on your way.

195
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,951
The one with the spectacular gardens,
Sotherton?

196
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:02,248
Actually, we're planning
some improvements.

197
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,035
And Fanny Price.

198
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:35,159
Well... you certainly seem a dreary lot!

199
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:42,823
Please, do join us in our game,
Mr. Crawford.

200
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,916
- Well...?
- I like them both exceedingly.

201
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,997
But I like Julia best.

202
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,666
Why?

203
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,323
Because her Aunt Norris advised me
that it must be so!

204
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:22,872
She seems very ready
to be fallen in love with.

205
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,619
Though Maria is most agreeable.

206
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,080
- Though her choice is made.
- Yes...

207
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,701
And I like her the better for it.

208
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:36,531
An engaged woman is always more
agreeable than a disengaged.

209
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,906
She is satisfied with herself.

210
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:42,704
Her cares are over, and she may exert
all her powers of pleasing

211
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:44,824
without suspicion.

212
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:48,952
All is safe with a lady engaged.
No harm can be done.

213
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:52,449
You allow yourself great latitude
on such points, Henry.

214
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:56,032
But you will be the one taken in at last.

215
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,239
"'I cannot know if he loves me,'
said Eliza."

216
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,705
"I asked, 'Did he never gaze
on you with admiration?"'

217
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:11,163
"'Tenderly press your hand?
Drop a tear and leave abruptly?"'

218
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,117
"'Never,' replied she."

219
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:18,121
"'He's always left the room
when his visit has been ended."'

220
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:21,663
Edmund...
What do you think?

221
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,203
She's delightful.

222
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,913
They're both delightful.

223
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:39,370
There could be no harm
in my liking an agreeable man.

224
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,617
- Everyone knows my situation.
- Must you always win?

225
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,954
Even when you already have your prize?

226
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,074
There will be disappointments.

227
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:50,657
If one scheme of happiness fails...

228
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,908
...human nature turns to another.

229
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:01,916
You may need your pretty philosophy
in the end, Maria.

230
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,242
Pity Tom, the eldest, is not here.

231
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,207
Or his L20,000 and his baronetcy!

232
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:15,458
Henry!
You know those things mean nothing to me.

233
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,741
Shall we stay on a while?

234
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,032
Yes, please.

235
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:55,531
I must say, the pleasures of life rarely
transcend such a moment as this.

236
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,824
Don't you agree, Pugsie?

237
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:00,826
God damn you!

238
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:04,657
Tom, are you well?
Is there war? Where's Sir Thomas?

239
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,115
Edmund, come quickly!

240
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:12,080
Tom, what of Antigua?
Where's Father?

241
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:16,582
Antigua... All the lovely people there
paying for this party.

242
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:19,327
Tom, we thought you were in Antigua.

243
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,992
Please!

244
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:26,665
Tom returned from Antigua
somewhat sooner than expected.

245
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:32,030
He spent a while in London.
I found him in the Covent Garden Theatre.

246
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,165
- A theatre?
- Yes. They're restaging this...

247
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:38,657
...delicious slice of naughtiness
called "Lovers' Vows".

248
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,617
I've heard of that.

249
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,784
Tom was a charming parasite until...

250
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,869
Well... he ran out of cash.

251
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:52,239
Since I sympathise with the tragedy
of unwarranted poverty,

252
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:57,530
I chose to deliver him to his family,
whom I now find to be so very...

253
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,241
...loving and beautiful.

254
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,832
And solvent.

255
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,698
Solvent?

256
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,532
Mr. Bertram?

257
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,280
The baron meets the bastard son,
takes back his lover,

258
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,785
and they all live happily, I presume,
for some time ever after.

259
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,784
- Bravo, Tom!
- Well told, Tom!

260
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:31,078
More dim-witted fiction
to clutter the world.

261
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,164
Come now, Mr. Bertram.

262
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,990
Drama is to life
what ships are to the sea.

263
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:41,415
A means to traverse it.
To plumb its depths, breadth and beauty.

264
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,497
I couldn't agree more.

265
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:47,370
Good drama, in which the greatest
powers of the mind are displayed,

266
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:52,536
in which the most thorough knowledge
of human nature, the liveliest wit,

267
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,578
are conveyed to the world
through the best chosen language.

268
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,534
This is essential.

269
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,203
This is trash!

270
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,621
He's so serious!

271
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,701
That is the worst charge, isn't it?

272
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:12,457
What do you think, Miss Price?

273
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:16,874
I'm sorry to disappoint,
but I do not have a ready opinion.

274
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:21,291
I suspect you are entirely composed
of ready opinions not shared.

275
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,076
Fanny.

276
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:27,202
- Yes, Aunt Norris?
- What are you doing here?

277
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:32,951
- I beg your pardon.
- The sewing wasn't cleared away.

278
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,747
You're quite right, it wasn't.
I'll...

279
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,951
I'll see to it immediately.

280
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:47,703
Aunt Norris, surely the sewing can wait?

281
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:03,911
Pray, is she out or is she not...
into society?

282
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:08,581
- I can't see that it matters terribly.
- Forget this nonsense.

283
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,866
Let's stage the play.

284
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,951
Here. Now.
Together.

285
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:17,082
Yatesy, you're a genius.

286
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:21,499
Why, this is the very room for a theatre.

287
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:27,159
And Father's study will
provide for an excellent stage!

288
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:33,577
It has been mentioned that I have
quite a gift for the stage... actually.

289
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,122
Tom, you're not serious?

290
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,952
Not serious?
Me?

291
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:44,492
"Lover's Vows"? I'm convinced
that our father would disapprove.

292
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:47,541
I think I know our father
as well as you do.

293
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,660
Manage yourself and let me
take care of the rest of the family.

294
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:55,454
Don't act yourself if you
do not like it, but please...

295
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,120
...don't try to govern everybody else.

296
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,490
All settled, then?

297
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:03,576
- Good!
- What?

298
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:08,366
What's the matter?
I was not asleep.

299
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:12,115
No, of course not, ma'am.
No one suspected you.

300
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,490
Where's Fanny?

301
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:17,741
Mrs. Norris, get me Fanny Price.

302
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,117
I wish to play Amelia.

303
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:27,081
But which gentleman am I to have
the pleasure of making love to?

304
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:33,327
Why has the wish to do what is right
become an unattractive quality?

305
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:37,203
And now Tom wants
Charles Maddox to play Anhalt.

306
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:41,078
He's about as discreet as the town crier!

307
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:48,331
So this is where you hide.
I need some rehearsing. Would you mind...?

308
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,074
Mr. Bertram!
Hello.

309
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,332
Hello, Miss Crawford.

310
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,405
- I'll be off, then, Fanny.
- Stay, stay!

311
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,789
Stay!
We need an audience.

312
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,033
We all need an audience, don't we, Fanny?

313
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,406
I live in dread of audiences.

314
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,663
Come.
I will play Amelia.

315
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,659
- And you will play Anhalt my teacher.
- No, no.

316
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:17,331
Read from there, since Mr. Bertram refuses.
I insist.

317
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,448
Very well.

318
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:25,703
"For a long time,
you have instructed me."

319
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:31,746
- "Why should not I now teach you?"
- "Teach me what?"

320
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:35,406
"Whatever I know and you don't."

321
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,033
"There are some things
I'd rather never know."

322
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,789
"As you made certain mathematical
problems pleasant to me,"

323
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,076
"I might teach
something as pleasant to you."

324
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,827
"Woman herself is a problem."

325
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:55,242
"And I'll teach you to make her out."

326
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,330
"You teach?"

327
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:59,082
"Why not?"

328
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:03,866
"None but a woman can teach
the science of herself."

329
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:10,541
Upon reconsideration,
I cannot help but think that...

330
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,417
...despite the displeasure
of appearing inconsistent,

331
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,948
it would be better for me to play Anhalt

332
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:19,034
than invite Charles Maddox
into this mixture.

333
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,406
Excellent!

334
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,828
"There are some things
I would rather never know."

335
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:37,657
"What is this?
How is this?"

336
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:43,664
"And why do I find my mother thus?
Speak."

337
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,624
"I cannot speak, my dear son."

338
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:50,116
"My dear Frederick,
I was not prepared."

339
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:54,241
"Dear Mother, compose yourself.
Now then..."

340
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,990
Put it down over there.

341
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:12,041
Hello, my sweet dear girl.

342
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,700
Welcome home, sir.

343
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,955
My word!
You've grown in health.

344
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,490
And, I dare say, beauty.

345
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:31,039
Where are the rest, Julia and Maria?
What's that?

346
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,034
- Well, it's...
- Improvements?

347
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,457
Baddeley.

348
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:51,617
You must be Sir Thomas!
I am Rushworth.

349
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:55,125
Your future son-in-law.

350
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:59,246
We are in the midst of a home theatrical.
I'm Count Cassel.

351
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:02,540
I come in with a blue dress
and a pink satin cloak...

352
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:07,987
...afterwards I have another fine suit
by way of a shooting dress.

353
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:11,704
I have two and forty speeches which is...

354
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:13,954
...no trifle.

355
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,580
Father!

356
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,451
- Absolutely not!
- It won't be much.

357
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,539
Father...

358
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:40,449
Tom... So this is what you were
in such a hurry to leave Antigua for?

359
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,620
Sir Thomas...

360
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:56,905
I could not have borne
your absence a moment longer.

361
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,744
Come on!

362
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,323
"Dear Susy, all remnants
of the theatre have been erased,"

363
00:34:23,542 --> 00:34:28,827
"and Tom and Yates have fled
the new solemnity that has returned."

364
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:31,495
Do tell us more about the Negroes, dear.

365
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:36,449
The mulattos are well-shaped, and
the women especially well-featured.

366
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:42,782
I have one, so easy and graceful in
her movements and intelligent as well.

367
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,117
Strangely, two mulattos
can never have children.

368
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,952
They're like mules in that respect.

369
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,074
Excuse me, Father, for contradicting
you, but that is nonsense.

370
00:34:56,292 --> 00:35:00,914
- You cannot say such things.
- I did not say they are mules.

371
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,080
I said they are like mules.

372
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:07,072
Long's 'History of Jamaica'.
Read it before you challenge me.

373
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:11,499
I've a good mind to bring one back
with me to work here as a domestic.

374
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:16,615
Correct if I am in error, but if you were
to bring a slave back to England,

375
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:22,202
there would be some argument
whether or not they should be freed.

376
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:27,284
If I'm not mistaken...

377
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,660
I must say, you've changed considerably.

378
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:36,493
I've done some reading on it...
Thomas Clarkson, under Edmund's guidance.

379
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:40,039
Fanny has a voracious mind,
as hungry as any man's.

380
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,995
And her writing is remarkable,
in a style entirely new.

381
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,159
Yes, good...
Yes...

382
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:51,155
Your complexion is so improved.

383
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:55,072
I trust you will see as much
beauty of mind in time, Father.

384
00:35:55,292 --> 00:36:00,245
You've gained so much countenance,
and your figure...

385
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,283
Please...

386
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,786
Don't you agree, Mr... Crawford?

387
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,864
- Purity is a decided attraction, true.
- Indeed.

388
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,624
Especially for the impure.

389
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:17,332
It must be the moral steadfastness
of her heart that illuminates her eyes.

390
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,954
- Please!
- Gentlemen...

391
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:24,871
Fanny is as fearful of notice and praise
as other women are of neglect.

392
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,863
- Most discerning, Miss Crawford.
- Thank you, Mr. Bertram.

393
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:33,159
I have it! A ball at Mansfield Park
in honour of Fanny!

394
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:36,492
We shall introduce
Miss Fanny Price to society.

395
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,621
Some young man of good standing
will take notice.

396
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:45,455
She'll glide about with quiet elegance
and in admirable time.

397
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,906
You must excuse me.

398
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,494
I think I have something...

399
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,992
It needn't be a large affair,
just a few friends...

400
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,541
Fanny, don't be foolish, it is raining.

401
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,618
I see more distinctly through the rain.

402
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:10,076
- It's just a silly ball.
- I'll not be sold off like a slave!

403
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:12,164
Don't be an imbecile!

404
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:16,285
But imbecility in women is a great
enhancement to personal charms!

405
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,122
Fanny...

406
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,573
You're being irrational!

407
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,161
Another adornment.
I must be ravishing.

408
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:29,079
Fanny, you really must begin
to harden yourself to the idea of...

409
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:32,159
...being worth looking at.

410
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:24,906
- You could do worse, Edmund.
- Sir?

411
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:28,491
She is witty and bright,
and not without... worth.

412
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,704
- How might you measure that worth?
- Don't impress me with your purity.

413
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:36,619
Her family is well-established,
it is well known.

414
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:39,452
The Prices?

415
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,951
The Crawfords, Edmund.

416
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:47,705
I meant the Crawfords...
Mary Crawford.

417
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:36,366
What are you reading?

418
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:40,624
Laurence Sterne's 'A Sentimental Journey'.

419
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:45,039
May I?

420
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,039
"I was interrupted with a voice
which I took to be that of a child,"

421
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,367
"which complained
it could not get out."

422
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:11,655
"I looked up and down the passage
and saw a starling in a little cage."

423
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:15,821
"'I can't get out, I can't get out!'
said the starling."

424
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:20,249
"'God help thee,' said I.
'But I'll let thee out, cost what it will."'

425
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:24,831
"But it was double-twisted with wire,
and I had to pull the cage to pieces."

426
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,530
"I took both hands to it."

427
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,452
"The bird flew to where I was
attempting his deliverance,"

428
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:35,205
"and thrusting his head
through the trellis as if impatient,"

429
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:39,289
"'I fear, poor creature,' said I,"

430
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:42,909
"'I cannot set thee at liberty."'

431
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,957
"'No,' said the starling."

432
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:50,540
"'I can't get out. I can't get out,'
said the starling."

433
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,328
You read well.

434
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,706
Thank you.

435
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:26,072
Father, I wish to speak
to you about Rushworth.

436
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:31,036
Maria, yes...

437
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:37,119
Now, you know how eagerly disposed
I was to like your Mr. Rushworth.

438
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:40,995
But you think him an inferior young man.

439
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,372
As ignorant in business as in books
with opinions unfixed

440
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:47,581
and without seeming
much aware of it himself.

441
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,324
I'm not blind, Father.

442
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:57,072
Perhaps the alliance, advantageous
as it is, was too quickly agreed to.

443
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:00,622
You need not worry, Maria,
I shall take care of you.

444
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:05,242
Every inconvenience should be braved
and the connection given up,

445
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:09,701
if you feel yourself unhappy
in the prospect of it.

446
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,697
I will not pretend
he is of shining character.

447
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:21,582
But I will also not pretend
that enjoying a larger income,

448
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:26,864
a house in the city and all the other
amiable pleasures it will afford,

449
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:29,619
are not an attraction.

450
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,741
As for the rest...

451
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,744
Well, he's still young.

452
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,416
And...

453
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,406
...I would like to marry him immediately.

454
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,948
Within a fortnight.

455
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:48,030
- I do not understand the urgency.
- I don't understand the delay.

456
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,829
I would like for Julia to accompany me
on the honeymoon.

457
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:56,285
You wish for Julia to accompany you
on your honeymoon?

458
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,368
She's never been to Brighton.

459
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:12,491
- Evening.
- Evening to you, sir.

460
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,830
"Dear Susy,
Maria was married on Saturday."

461
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:23,324
"In all important preparations of mind,
she was complete."

462
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:25,828
"Prepared for matrimony
by a hatred of home,"

463
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:31,493
"disappointed affection and contempt
of the man she was to marry."

464
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:38,620
"The bride was elegantly dressed and
the bridesmaids were duly inferior."

465
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:45,197
"Her mother had her salts, expecting
to be agitated, and her aunt tried to cry."

466
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:48,829
"Marriage is indeed
a manoeuvring business."

467
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:53,114
Goodbye, my precious!

468
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,454
Good luck!

469
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,243
Bye!

470
00:43:57,458 --> 00:44:01,997
It is a comfort to think
you will never leave us, Fanny.

471
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:27,325
- My dear Fanny!
- No, no...

472
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:36,248
- I should take the apples to Mrs. Norris.
- I want you to stay and play with me.

473
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:38,248
She must forgive me.

474
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:43,329
Selfishness must always be forgiven,
because there's no hope of a cure!

475
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,785
So lovely.

476
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,155
Tomorrow evening, the ballroom
shall be lit solely by your beauty.

477
00:44:57,375 --> 00:45:00,539
You do have a fine form, my dear.

478
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,950
No wonder Edmund
so delights in your company.

479
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:07,414
I'm so evil he knows not
what to make of me.

480
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:10,789
Would that I had your sound judgment.

481
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,657
Tell me...

482
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:17,536
- Does he speak of me?
- Occasionally.

483
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,032
Is that your harp in the front room?

484
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,196
Indeed. It was transported
from London on Henry's carriage.

485
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:27,372
I tried to hire a horse and cart,

486
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:31,826
but found I'd asked the most
unreasonable thing in the world!

487
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:36,746
I'd offended all the farmers,
the labourers and the hay in the parish.

488
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:39,198
Getting the hay in is of great importance

489
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:42,498
in the country... at this time.

490
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:45,995
And music isn't?

491
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:48,957
It depends on the music, I suppose.

492
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:22,365
That's Edmund's favourite.
He seems very alive to music.

493
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:24,242
Yes...

494
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:28,748
Edmund says that in church it is music
that best allows the spirit...

495
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:31,198
...to aspire to the beyond.

496
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:32,826
Heavens!

497
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:37,699
Why waste it on drowsy church-goers
starched up into seeming piety?

498
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:41,496
Give me a concert or a dance.
I'm sure he'd agree.

499
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:45,405
Forgive me my contradiction,
but I'm sure he wouldn't.

500
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:51,574
When he takes orders in a few weeks,
he will begin his own services.

501
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:54,197
Takes orders?

502
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:57,666
Is Edmund to be a clergyman?

503
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,700
Yes.

504
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:04,831
But a clergyman is so drear.
A clergyman's wife is even worse!

505
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:10,615
What profession would you suggest,
Miss Crawford?

506
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:13,322
I'm not, as you know, the first born.

507
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:17,037
There must be an uncle or grandfather
to place you somewhere?

508
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,956
There is not.

509
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:21,204
Choose law, then, it's not too late.

510
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:24,865
At least you can distinguish yourself
there with language and wit.

511
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:29,575
I have no wish to blunder about
on the borders of empty repartee.

512
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:31,913
Your father could put you into Parliament.

513
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:36,368
My father's choices
are less than compelling for me.

514
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:39,830
No, I wish to become a clergyman.

515
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,241
There are worse things than a life
of compassion and contemplation.

516
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:53,368
She doesn't think evil, but she speaks it.

517
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:55,787
It grieves me to the soul.

518
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,081
The effect of education perhaps.

519
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:03,621
Perhaps I can uneducate her.

520
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:07,246
Fanny, would that more women
were like you.

521
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:13,039
I love you more than words can say.
I demand the first dance at the ball.

522
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:42,948
One's consequence varies so much
at times without any particular reason.

523
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:49,281
There's a reason for everything.
Your entire person is agreeable.

524
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:53,823
Yes.
Well, tonight I agree with everyone.

525
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,575
Edmund...

526
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:06,954
I think you should admit
you're in love with Fanny Price.

527
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:09,371
Of course I love her, but...

528
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:14,739
...there are as many forms of love
as there are moments in time.

529
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:27,118
Perfect!
You dance like an angel, Fanny Price.

530
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:30,864
One does not dance like an angel alone,
Mr. Crawford.

531
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:35,124
A compliment?!
Let the heavens rejoice!

532
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:39,576
I complimented your dancing.
Keep your wig on!

533
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:54,160
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

534
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,199
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

535
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,448
"A few hours before Laura died, she said,"

536
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:12,997
"'Take warning from my unhappy end."'

537
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:17,332
"'Beware of fainting fits.
Beware of swoons."'

538
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:42,409
"'Run mad as often as you choose..."'

539
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:47,783
"'...but do not faint."'

540
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:55,206
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Sir Thomas.

541
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:57,952
- Good afternoon, sir.
- My dear.

542
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:02,076
I've been thinking about the parsonage.

543
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:04,329
Not you, too?

544
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:07,156
Spades are trumps, Fanny.

545
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:12,956
- I'm all in the glow of a new scheme.
- And what might that be?

546
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:16,118
Might you rent the parsonage to me?

547
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:20,907
- But it is to be Edmund's.
- Anyone to purchase a queen?

548
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:23,578
- At what cost?
- Two shillings.

549
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:28,366
- Highway robbery!
- Mr. Bertram could stay living here.

550
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,788
You can stay close to your family,

551
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,290
and I can continue to improve
and perfect my friendship and...

552
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,328
...intimacy
with the Mansfield Park family.

553
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:42,575
I have a better plan.
Live here with us.

554
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,908
Stay as long as you wish.
Bring all your horses.

555
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:49,242
Your sister, too.
Be as one of our family.

556
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:55,039
- We'd thrive on it, wouldn't we, Fanny?
- Of course. A king for three shillings?

557
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:59,158
- I will.
- Mary! It's exorbitant!

558
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:04,079
I'll stake my last like a woman of spirit.
No cold prudence for me.

559
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:06,745
I was not made
to sit still and do nothing!

560
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:10,952
If I lose the game,
it shall not be for not striving for it.

561
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,541
Well done, Fanny!

562
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,661
Fanny!
I must speak to you...

563
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,912
Yes, Mr. Crawford?

564
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,699
You must know
why I intend to rent the parsonage.

565
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:39,574
I wish to continue improving
and perfecting my intimacy...

566
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:41,699
...with you!

567
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:47,072
You have created sensations which
my heart has never known before.

568
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:50,373
The one happiness in life
is to love and be loved.

569
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:52,869
Mr. Crawford, do not speak nonsense!

570
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:55,829
Nonsense?

571
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:59,786
I'm afraid you may end
in convincing yourself!

572
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,823
Fanny...
You are killing me!

573
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:09,035
No man dies of love but on the stage.

574
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,533
"The intimacy between them
daily increased,"

575
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:31,407
"till it grew to such a pitch that
they did not scruple to kick one another"

576
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:34,623
"on the slightest provocation."

577
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,998
Yes?

578
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,790
My sweet girl!
This is a great day, a great day indeed.

579
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,872
Yes...
Is it?

580
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:51,414
You may make me more proud
than my own daughters.

581
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:54,623
Please don't say that, sir.

582
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:58,790
Why is there no fire here today?

583
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:04,077
- I'm not cold, sir.
- But you have a fire in general?

584
00:55:04,292 --> 00:55:07,373
No, sir, but I have a warm shawl.

585
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:12,288
Your aunt cannot be aware of this.

586
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,828
I understand.

587
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:22,995
For as long as you're in my home,
Fanny Price, you shall have a fire.

588
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,408
I am aware that there has been
a misplaced distinction, but...

589
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:33,448
...I think too well of you to suppose
you will ever harbour resentment.

590
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:36,202
Thus, it is with more pleasure,

591
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:41,287
that I inform you that Henry Crawford
has asked my permission to marry you,

592
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,656
and I have given my blessing.

593
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:47,703
I'd no idea his feelings
had come to such a boiling point!

594
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:53,072
Clearly, I am too old to follow
the intricate manoeuvrings of the young.

595
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:59,534
Please get ready and join me downstairs.

596
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:05,083
Mr. Crawford, as you have perhaps foreseen,
is still in the house.

597
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,904
Do not fear.

598
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:16,411
I cannot, sir.

599
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,331
Cannot what?

600
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:22,286
I cannot agree to marry him...
at this time.

601
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,825
You do not know your own feelings.
I've watched you with him.

602
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:30,573
You're not insensitive to his charms.
I'm not that old!

603
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:32,913
He's not without charm, sir.

604
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:37,035
Has someone else
declared his intention for you?

605
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:40,698
- No, sir.
- Then what is it?

606
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:44,701
I do not trust his nature.

607
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:49,206
Like many charming people, he
depends on the appreciation of others.

608
00:56:49,417 --> 00:56:51,491
What is the ill in that?

609
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:55,489
His sole interest is in being loved,
not in loving.

610
00:56:55,708 --> 00:57:01,622
- You've read too many novels, girl!
- But it has not clouded my judgment.

611
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,364
- Do you trust me?
- My future entirely depends on you.

612
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:09,534
Let me repeat: do you trust me?

613
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,582
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I trust him.

614
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:15,873
You will marry him!

615
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,750
I will not...

616
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:22,783
...sir.

617
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:31,952
I had, Fanny Price, thought you
free from wilfulness of temper,

618
00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:36,658
self-conceit and every tendency
to that independence of spirit,

619
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:40,821
which prevails so much today
even in young women.

620
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:46,825
In young women it is especially
offensive beyond all common offence.

621
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:51,865
You seem to forget you do not have
an annual income like Mary Crawford.

622
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:54,074
Nor does your family.

623
00:57:54,292 --> 00:57:58,996
Their advantage or disadvantage
has never been in your thoughts.

624
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:03,118
The young man addresses you
with everything to recommend him.

625
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:07,576
Not merely situation in life, fortune
and character, but also agreeableness,

626
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:10,576
with pleasing address and conversation.

627
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:14,204
...not an acquaintance,
you've known him some time.

628
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:20,828
His sister is your intimate friend.
He cannot have taken you by surprise.

629
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:25,533
You have observed his attentions
and received them properly...

630
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:31,580
You do not know your own feelings.
Let us put an end to this conference.

631
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:34,362
...and because you do not feel
for him

632
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:39,655
what a young heated fancy imagines
to be necessary for happiness...

633
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,949
I should say not...

634
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:49,156
You are in a wild fit of folly, throwing
away an opportunity to be settled in life,

635
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:55,537
eligibly, honourably, nobly settled,
as will probably never occur again.

636
00:58:56,083 --> 00:59:01,783
And I will tell you what, Fanny Price,
which is more than I did for Maria...

637
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,247
The next time that Pug has a litter...

638
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:09,201
...you shall have a puppy.

639
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:19,158
All she needs is time, Sir Thomas.

640
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:21,330
He loves you, Fanny Price.

641
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:27,290
If any man ever loved a woman forever,
Henry would do as much for you.

642
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,038
Edmund...

643
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,868
What are your thoughts?

644
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:39,949
The fact that he chose you, Fanny,
is evidence of his good character.

645
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:47,492
He could make you very happy,
and you would be the making of him.

646
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:56,912
It is not certain that a man must be
acceptable to every woman he likes.

647
00:59:57,125 --> 01:00:02,743
Perhaps you'd rather return home?
I can write to your mother tonight.

648
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:07,166
A little abstinence from the luxuries
of Mansfield Park

649
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:10,741
might bring your mind
into a more sober state.

650
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:14,040
Is that your choice, young woman?

651
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:17,579
Yes.

652
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,123
It is.

653
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:22,166
Why, Fanny?

654
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:29,784
To be at home again...

655
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:33,333
...to be loved by my family,

656
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:37,487
to feel affection
without fear or restraint and...

657
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:43,123
...to feel myself the equal
of those that surround me.

658
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,413
I hope you know...

659
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:11,779
I hope you know how much I shall...

660
01:01:13,292 --> 01:01:15,117
...shall write to you.

661
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:19,911
And I shall write to you...

662
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:26,281
...when I have anything
worth writing about.

663
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:48,703
Who says we shall not be sisters?

664
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,991
I know we shall.

665
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,039
There!

666
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:24,748
Mother!

667
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,913
Fanny!

668
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:30,080
Come in.

669
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:33,582
You must be exhausted from your journey.

670
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:36,576
It's surprisingly short really.

671
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:39,660
Look at you.
So...

672
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:46,329
Betsey, get Father up!
Come in.

673
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,746
It's Susy's turn.

674
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:57,121
Did you have a tiring journey?
You must be exhausted. Betsey!

675
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,248
- I got him up yesterday.
- Liar!

676
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:12,040
- You must have many servants.
- I have to do quite a lot, actually.

677
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:16,291
- I help Lady Bertram and Aunt Norris.
- I only have the two girls.

678
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,161
We had some help,
but now Father has no work.

679
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:22,081
Hello.

680
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:26,914
- How long are you here for, Fanny?
- I cannot say exactly.

681
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,827
Father won't get up.

682
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:32,822
She's here!

683
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:36,244
Hello!

684
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:40,497
Oh, my God!
Fanny!

685
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:43,244
You look so fancy.

686
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:48,791
Like a princess! Didn't I tell you
she'd be beautiful, Mother?

687
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:51,164
Yes, you did.

688
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:55,871
Father, Fanny's come home.
Here she is.

689
01:04:56,625 --> 01:05:00,073
Turn round, then.
Let's have a look at you.

690
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,872
Turn around!

691
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:07,910
Lovely.

692
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:13,453
Come here, Chatterbox,
I was just teasing you.

693
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:17,874
Give your coarse old father a big squeeze.

694
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,491
Welcome home, Fanny.

695
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:27,326
It'll be good to have another girl around.

696
01:05:28,042 --> 01:05:34,323
Well, I'm about ready to throw down
some straw and call this place a stall.

697
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:36,698
Don't get me started!

698
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:03,365
"Beware of fainting fits,
beware of swoons."

699
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:07,659
"A frenzy fit is not so pernicious.
It is an exercise to the body."

700
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:10,873
"if not too violent,
it is conducive to health."

701
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,453
Fanny, a letter!

702
01:06:13,667 --> 01:06:15,243
Who is it from?

703
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:18,456
Mary Crawford, a friend.

704
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:24,030
"How we miss you,
my dearest Fanny Price."

705
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:28,540
"My brother is moping. Please write
a pretty reply to gladden his eyes."

706
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:34,119
"Tell me of all the dashing captains
whom you disdain for his sake."

707
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:41,997
"I have seen Julia and Mrs. Rushworth
at Wimpole Street the other day."

708
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:47,577
"We seemed very glad to see each
other, and I do think we were a little."

709
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,911
"We had a vast deal to say..."

710
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,164
"...especially on the subject
of you and Henry."

711
01:06:56,375 --> 01:07:00,665
"I'll tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked
when your name was mentioned."

712
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,996
Fanny...?

713
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:05,199
Fanny Price?

714
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:08,166
"I didn't think her wanting
in self-possession,"

715
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:13,612
"but she had not quite enough
for the demands of yesterday."

716
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:17,530
I shall believe it when I believe it, Henry.

717
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,618
And so you shall, Mrs. Rushworth.

718
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,996
"And as for Edmund, clergyman or not,"

719
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:30,328
"let me say, I am increasingly
sensitive to his charms."

720
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:33,623
"Yours affectionately,
Mary Crawford."

721
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:35,907
Betsey!

722
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,112
This Henry Crawford, what's he like?

723
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,573
A rake, I think.

724
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:51,908
Yes, please!

725
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:55,123
They amuse more in literature
than in life.

726
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:57,786
But they amuse!

727
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,576
And Lady Bertram?

728
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:02,659
- She's always suffering fatigue.
- Why?

729
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:06,406
Generally from embroidering
something of little beauty.

730
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:09,872
Not to mention
a handsome dose of opium daily.

731
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:14,207
Your tongue is sharper
than a guillotine, Fanny.

732
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:18,290
The effect of education, I suppose.

733
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:29,956
Miss Price!
Miss Fanny Price!

734
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:33,532
- Miss Price?
- What is that racket?

735
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:37,744
- Miss Price!
- What is it, boy?

736
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,873
I must see Fanny Price!

737
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:47,160
Miss Price?

738
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:52,330
- Miss Fanny Price...
- I'm Fanny Price.

739
01:08:52,542 --> 01:08:56,950
- You sure? I don't get paid if you're not.
- Yes, I'm sure I'm Fanny Price.

740
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:00,248
All right, then, stay back.

741
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:53,073
I was supposed to say something
about starlings flying... I can't remember.

742
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:56,492
Yes, we've got the general idea.
Thank you.

743
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:59,375
Fanny, what is this?

744
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:16,368
Thank you for coming.

745
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:19,072
- Mr. Price.
- Yes?

746
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:24,165
- Henry Crawford. Friend of...
- ...Maria Bertram's.

747
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:26,579
Pleased to meet you.

748
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,119
And you must be Mrs. Price.

749
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:34,990
I see the resemblance to your sisters,
Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris.

750
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:38,408
Your family has
no inconsiderable share of beauty.

751
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,658
You're too kind, Mr. Crawford.

752
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:43,581
Miss Price.

753
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:46,242
Mr. Crawford.

754
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:51,118
It was you, wasn't it?
The birds and everything...

755
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:56,488
I'm sorry, I... do not know
to what you're referring.

756
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:06,704
So, what is the news of Mansfield?
How is everyone?

757
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:10,745
Everyone being Edmund...
Fanny, I know.

758
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:14,904
- You know what, Henry?
- I know you love Edmund.

759
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:17,578
I wish to speak in truths.

760
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:22,283
It is the effect of your education of me,
Fanny Price.

761
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:30,409
He is a fine man, I understand,
but he is to be married to my sister.

762
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:33,907
The words have been spoken?

763
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,162
All but.

764
01:11:37,667 --> 01:11:42,822
- I shall wait to grieve until then.
- You must grieve now.

765
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,496
I know I have an appearance
of inauthenticity.

766
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:55,036
You're infinitely my superior in merit,
you have touches of the angel in you.

767
01:11:55,250 --> 01:12:00,950
And I know you have witnessed
my insincere attentions toward Maria.

768
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:06,404
But your eyes are so clear and
unflinching, please look at me again.

769
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:08,616
I am changed, Fanny Price.

770
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:12,080
I shall wait for you till the end of time.

771
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:14,780
My constancy shall prove
that I am changed.

772
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,200
It is your very changefulness
that frightens me.

773
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,905
- You toy with me.
- No.

774
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:25,617
Senseless as it is,
my heart is still full of another.

775
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:33,536
Then I shall wait...

776
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,451
...till it is free once more.

777
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:50,457
"It is the habits of wealth that I fear."

778
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:55,324
"Still, she is the only woman
whom I could ever think of as..."

779
01:12:56,833 --> 01:13:00,199
Go and sit down, Charlie,
I've got to read this letter.

780
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:02,206
Susy, could you...?

781
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:14,362
"Still, she is the only woman
whom I could ever think of as..."

782
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:17,871
"...a wife."

783
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:12,822
Where would your tenants go,
if we moved in?

784
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:16,786
I've several apartments,
they'd be well-cared for.

785
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,492
- It is a generous offer.
- The first of many, I hope.

786
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:43,933
Fanny...

787
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:47,685
Yes?

788
01:14:48,733 --> 01:14:51,980
I've been thinking, Fanny.

789
01:15:00,067 --> 01:15:04,523
There is no shame in wealth, my dear.

790
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:13,729
- That depends on how it's arrived at.
- Frances! Come here!

791
01:15:17,983 --> 01:15:20,269
Just remember, Fanny...

792
01:15:21,692 --> 01:15:25,022
...I married for love.

793
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:44,605
How does it feel to be home?

794
01:15:44,817 --> 01:15:48,313
Portsmouth is Portsmouth,
and Mansfield is home.

795
01:15:48,525 --> 01:15:51,476
You don't like to be near the water?

796
01:15:51,692 --> 01:15:53,730
Not without the means to float away on it.

797
01:15:53,942 --> 01:15:55,269
You have.

798
01:15:55,483 --> 01:16:01,148
Poverty frightens me.
A woman's poverty is harsher than a man's.

799
01:16:01,358 --> 01:16:03,396
Well, arguable.

800
01:16:04,483 --> 01:16:07,102
- It need not be your lot.
- I know.

801
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:11,227
You can spend your days in comfort...
with me.

802
01:16:12,817 --> 01:16:15,484
- I know.
- You do?

803
01:16:16,275 --> 01:16:18,313
Yes.

804
01:16:26,067 --> 01:16:28,390
Is that a 'yes'?

805
01:16:31,233 --> 01:16:33,105
Yes.

806
01:16:43,817 --> 01:16:49,814
Is that the 'yes' I've heard a thousand
times in my heart but not from you?

807
01:16:58,858 --> 01:17:01,228
Fanny Price!

808
01:17:04,317 --> 01:17:09,686
You will learn to love me.
Say it again, please, say it!

809
01:17:11,067 --> 01:17:13,104
Yes!

810
01:17:57,983 --> 01:18:04,560
Good morning, Miss Price!
Good morning, my darling!

811
01:18:04,775 --> 01:18:08,899
- Stop, please! Stop it!
- Good morning.

812
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,182
Charlie, come on.

813
01:18:20,025 --> 01:18:22,692
I spoke hastily.

814
01:18:25,608 --> 01:18:29,815
I've anguished over the matter,
and I feel that I cannot...

815
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:34,597
I cannot marry you.

816
01:18:35,317 --> 01:18:38,315
I'm not prepared.

817
01:18:40,233 --> 01:18:44,641
- And when might you be prepared?
- I cannot say.

818
01:18:45,858 --> 01:18:48,642
When might that be?

819
01:18:49,567 --> 01:18:52,482
I still doubt you and cannot trust you.

820
01:18:52,692 --> 01:18:54,730
Doubt me?

821
01:18:56,317 --> 01:19:01,353
Your behaviour is that of someone
trustworthy, the standard of trust?

822
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:03,190
Forgive me.

823
01:19:04,942 --> 01:19:07,810
Enjoy your stay in Portsmouth, Miss Price.

824
01:19:09,942 --> 01:19:14,101
May it be long...
and up to your standards.

825
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:18,727
Henry...

826
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:42,517
Are you certain?

827
01:19:42,733 --> 01:19:45,814
I have no talent for certainty, Susy.

828
01:20:06,483 --> 01:20:08,888
Fanny, come quickly.

829
01:20:09,108 --> 01:20:10,649
Fanny...

830
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:14,306
Who's to pay for all this paper, Fanny?

831
01:20:14,525 --> 01:20:15,899
Come, come.

832
01:20:25,983 --> 01:20:27,524
Edmund...

833
01:20:28,275 --> 01:20:32,316
I've come to take you back to Mansfield.
You're needed there.

834
01:20:34,025 --> 01:20:38,729
- What's happened?
- Tom was celebrating and fell ill.

835
01:20:38,942 --> 01:20:43,434
The group he was travelling with
left him to recover with Yates...

836
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:46,352
...who then deserted him as well.

837
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:49,565
He was found almost dead two days ago.

838
01:20:50,275 --> 01:20:52,313
The situation is very grave.

839
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:56,399
We must hurry.

840
01:20:56,608 --> 01:20:58,764
If you wish to, that is.

841
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:08,934
Fanny, I cannot tell you how much I...

842
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:13,644
- I shall see you soon, Susy, I feel it.
- Go on, now!

843
01:21:14,942 --> 01:21:19,765
Remember: "Run mad as often
as you choose, but do not faint!"

844
01:21:35,858 --> 01:21:38,939
I trust, other than this tragedy,
you're well?

845
01:21:39,817 --> 01:21:42,021
Yes...

846
01:21:42,233 --> 01:21:45,314
As I intimated in my last letter,

847
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:51,522
I believe Mary has almost reconciled
herself to marrying a stodgy clergyman.

848
01:21:58,108 --> 01:22:01,189
I understand Crawford paid you a visit.

849
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,857
Yes.

850
01:22:03,983 --> 01:22:06,685
And was he attentive?

851
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:10,230
Yes...
Very.

852
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:16,898
And has your heart changed towards him?

853
01:22:19,358 --> 01:22:21,064
Yes...

854
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:23,396
Several times.

855
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:29,308
I have...
I find that I...

856
01:22:30,858 --> 01:22:32,648
I find that...

857
01:22:36,025 --> 01:22:41,180
Surely you and I are beyond speaking,
when words are clearly not enough.

858
01:22:47,025 --> 01:22:48,897
I missed you.

859
01:22:51,192 --> 01:22:53,478
And I you.

860
01:24:11,192 --> 01:24:15,351
- Fanny, you're back.
- Yes, sir.

861
01:24:15,567 --> 01:24:20,687
Good. We've had our fill
of estrangement at Mansfield Park.

862
01:24:35,275 --> 01:24:36,602
Water.

863
01:24:47,275 --> 01:24:50,226
The light... please.

864
01:24:55,483 --> 01:24:58,054
- Morning, sir.
- Dear Mr. Crawford.

865
01:24:58,275 --> 01:25:04,556
Thank you for joining us at this difficult
time. Maria will be joining us later.

866
01:25:04,775 --> 01:25:08,354
Mr. Rushworth is detained
with improvements to Sotherton.

867
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:13,059
- Miss Julia is due within the hour.
- Welcome.

868
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:16,143
- Fanny.
- Thank you for coming.

869
01:25:16,358 --> 01:25:22,473
Fanny, I've been meaning to ask you,
how long are you staying?

870
01:25:23,317 --> 01:25:27,809
I'm not certain, Aunt Norris.
And how long are you staying?

871
01:26:24,692 --> 01:26:26,730
Mrs. Rushworth...

872
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,604
- I trust you are well?
- I'm fine.

873
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:34,140
And Mr. Rushworth?

874
01:26:35,067 --> 01:26:37,022
Maria...

875
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:44,556
Is this the behaviour of friends?
Maria... Please...

876
01:26:44,775 --> 01:26:46,849
How's Fanny?

877
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,889
She's a good little girl.

878
01:26:54,983 --> 01:26:58,811
And you've become a good little boy?

879
01:27:06,525 --> 01:27:09,606
She's rejected me, Maria.

880
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,480
Would that this sigh were for me...

881
01:28:29,858 --> 01:28:32,263
My son is mad.

882
01:28:34,233 --> 01:28:36,722
Go to your room!

883
01:28:36,942 --> 01:28:39,063
Get out!

884
01:30:21,642 --> 01:30:25,422
Fanny, what is it? What?
What's wrong?

885
01:30:25,642 --> 01:30:26,969
What?

886
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:47,390
Don't look at me like that Edmund.
Rushworth's a fool, and I can't get out.

887
01:30:48,725 --> 01:30:50,632
Edmund...

888
01:30:51,308 --> 01:30:53,595
I can't get out.

889
01:31:37,558 --> 01:31:39,596
You all right?

890
01:31:46,475 --> 01:31:49,094
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

891
01:32:04,892 --> 01:32:07,594
Good morning, Mansfield Park!

892
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,598
Come!

893
01:32:20,475 --> 01:32:24,931
Get Edmund, Sir Thomas and Maria.
We have an important guest here.

894
01:32:25,142 --> 01:32:29,052
Edmund!
This is Mr. Dixon of the 'London Times'.

895
01:32:29,267 --> 01:32:35,097
He is writing an article about modern
gardens and is interested in Sotherton.

896
01:32:35,308 --> 01:32:36,931
Where's Maria?

897
01:32:37,142 --> 01:32:42,048
He has noticed the influence of Gilpin.
He loves the new ruins.

898
01:32:42,267 --> 01:32:45,798
Wake up, you degenerate lot!
Hello!

899
01:32:46,017 --> 01:32:48,636
- Maria?
- Sir... Sir!

900
01:33:02,183 --> 01:33:06,675
- Where's Maria?
- I could not say...

901
01:33:07,517 --> 01:33:09,389
At this hour?

902
01:33:11,267 --> 01:33:13,387
We'll speak to Crawford.

903
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,387
It was recommendation to remove
the avenue of oaks from the west front,

904
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:22,179
up to the top of the hill.

905
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:30,136
- Where is Crawford?
- At the parsonage with the Grants.

906
01:33:33,017 --> 01:33:36,430
No, we... stopped there first.

907
01:33:53,642 --> 01:33:55,549
Sir Thomas...

908
01:33:55,767 --> 01:33:59,631
There's something you must read.
Oh, dear, dear...

909
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:05,052
It is... quite startling.
Here, in the society section.

910
01:34:11,933 --> 01:34:14,635
Fanny...

911
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:17,839
You read it to us.

912
01:34:18,058 --> 01:34:21,969
You have such a strong, clear voice.

913
01:34:34,308 --> 01:34:38,172
"It is with infinite concern
we have to announce that..."

914
01:34:38,392 --> 01:34:44,424
"...a matrimonial fracas in the family
of Mr. Rushworth of Wimpole Street."

915
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:47,427
Go on.

916
01:34:48,392 --> 01:34:49,968
"The beautiful Mrs. Rushworth,"

917
01:34:50,183 --> 01:34:53,715
"who was to be so brilliant a leader
in the fashionable world,"

918
01:34:53,933 --> 01:34:59,716
"has quitted her husband's roof
for the captivating Mr. Crawford,"

919
01:34:59,933 --> 01:35:03,180
"the intimate friend
of not only Mr. Rushworth,"

920
01:35:03,392 --> 01:35:08,677
"but Mrs. Rushworth's father,
Sir Thomas Bertram of Mansfield Park."

921
01:35:08,892 --> 01:35:14,047
"it is not known even to the editor
whither they have gone."

922
01:35:14,267 --> 01:35:16,802
May God help us.

923
01:35:20,392 --> 01:35:23,722
The fools!
Under this roof!

924
01:35:23,933 --> 01:35:28,341
They should've known Rushworth
would bring in a newspaper man.

925
01:35:28,558 --> 01:35:33,097
Under which roof
would it have been better, Mary?

926
01:35:33,308 --> 01:35:37,219
I understand your bitterness,
but do not direct it at me.

927
01:35:37,433 --> 01:35:39,839
Your brother is an actor.

928
01:35:40,058 --> 01:35:43,673
A charming inscrutable actor,
through and through.

929
01:35:43,892 --> 01:35:49,426
The temptation of quick pleasure was
too strong for one unused to sacrifices.

930
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:56,132
After all the cost and care of an
anxious and expensive education,

931
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:59,597
I do not feel I know
my own children at all.

932
01:35:59,808 --> 01:36:03,055
Now, please, of course you know them.

933
01:36:03,267 --> 01:36:06,632
This is 1806, for heaven's sake!

934
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:11,306
This is not the first time, nor the last,
such a thing will happen.

935
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:13,140
Look...

936
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:16,301
You are indeed a family in distress,

937
01:36:16,517 --> 01:36:20,096
but you must recover
and survive gracefully.

938
01:36:21,975 --> 01:36:25,471
If Henry does not choose to marry Maria,

939
01:36:25,683 --> 01:36:29,049
and if you also reject her,
she will be an outcast.

940
01:36:29,267 --> 01:36:32,348
A leaf in the wind of other men's plans.

941
01:36:32,558 --> 01:36:34,099
Or...

942
01:36:35,475 --> 01:36:37,679
We can recover.

943
01:36:39,308 --> 01:36:41,512
Here is my proposal...

944
01:36:41,725 --> 01:36:44,889
We must persuade Henry to marry Maria.

945
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:48,548
After a respectable period,
Edmund and I will accept them

946
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:52,760
into our acquaintance...
and household.

947
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:03,134
Then you all, after an appropriate
period, will properly support them, too.

948
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:07,011
The Bertrams, being people
of respectability, as they are,

949
01:37:07,225 --> 01:37:11,681
she may recover her footing in society
to a certain degree.

950
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:16,134
In some circles, she'd never be
admitted, but with dinners and parties...

951
01:37:16,350 --> 01:37:18,969
...some people will like her acquaintance.

952
01:37:19,183 --> 01:37:20,759
Such a strategy.

953
01:37:20,975 --> 01:37:26,130
And how will a poor clergyman
afford these dinners and parties?

954
01:37:26,350 --> 01:37:28,921
Chance is not always unkind.

955
01:37:31,433 --> 01:37:34,431
I beg your pardon.

956
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,134
If Tom is not able to recover,

957
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:41,885
Edmund will be the heir.

958
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:46,176
Wealth and consequence could fall
into hands no more deserving.

959
01:37:56,850 --> 01:38:00,511
I understand you think
I should not say such things.

960
01:38:00,725 --> 01:38:04,137
But one must prepare oneself
for every eventuality.

961
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,803
It is the mark of an evolved individual.

962
01:38:07,017 --> 01:38:12,765
I advise that you, Sir Thomas, do not
injure your cause by interference.

963
01:38:12,975 --> 01:38:15,049
Let things take their course.

964
01:38:15,267 --> 01:38:17,506
That may be a difficult thing,

965
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:22,678
but although Tom, bless his heart, may
not be strong enough for this world,

966
01:38:22,892 --> 01:38:25,641
the rest of us must be.

967
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,345
I speak merely of what must be done,
not what I feel.

968
01:38:32,558 --> 01:38:37,050
You may wish to reconsider
your eagerness for Tom's death.

969
01:38:37,267 --> 01:38:41,509
You may wish to reconsider
your thinly-veiled anger towards me!

970
01:38:43,642 --> 01:38:48,015
If you'd accepted my brother,
you'd be now on the point of marriage,

971
01:38:48,225 --> 01:38:51,804
and Henry would not be
on terms with Mrs. Rushworth.

972
01:38:52,017 --> 01:38:54,932
It would have ended in a regular flirtation

973
01:38:55,142 --> 01:38:58,010
in meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.

974
01:38:58,225 --> 01:39:02,089
It could all be construed as your fault.

975
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:08,679
Your startling adaptability
to my brother's possible demise

976
01:39:08,892 --> 01:39:12,885
sends a chill through my heart.

977
01:39:13,475 --> 01:39:15,761
A chill...

978
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:21,716
You're cheerfully planning parties
with his money!

979
01:39:21,933 --> 01:39:25,594
You shush my father
like a dog at your table.

980
01:39:25,808 --> 01:39:31,841
You attack Fanny for following her own
infallible guide on matters of the heart.

981
01:39:32,058 --> 01:39:37,011
All this has grievously convinced me
that the person I've so dwelt on

982
01:39:37,225 --> 01:39:39,714
has been a creature of my own imagination!

983
01:39:42,183 --> 01:39:44,257
Not you, Miss Crawford...

984
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,681
You are a stranger to me.

985
01:39:50,892 --> 01:39:55,679
I do not know you, and I'm sorry to say,
I have no wish to.

986
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:31,303
Is there anything to be done?

987
01:40:31,517 --> 01:40:33,223
Wait...

988
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:37,932
- Wait?
- Yes.

989
01:40:38,142 --> 01:40:41,389
Time can do almost anything.

990
01:40:51,058 --> 01:40:53,344
He'll be all right.

991
01:41:01,017 --> 01:41:04,678
He survived brain fever when he was six.

992
01:41:11,433 --> 01:41:14,597
He used to play 'Tom the Knight'.

993
01:41:16,517 --> 01:41:20,048
"Give me a mission, Father," he'd say.

994
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:25,470
I'd send him with a message to mother
about the tea or...

995
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:29,965
...to get Baddeley
to get the carriage ready.

996
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:32,887
"No, Father..."

997
01:41:34,892 --> 01:41:37,261
"Give me a noble mission."

998
01:41:44,392 --> 01:41:47,259
That's all he ever wanted.

999
01:42:02,225 --> 01:42:04,630
I'm sorry, Tom.

1000
01:42:08,933 --> 01:42:10,343
I'm so sorry.

1001
01:42:40,017 --> 01:42:42,766
"In good and perfect time,"

1002
01:42:42,975 --> 01:42:45,843
"Tom's health did return."

1003
01:42:46,058 --> 01:42:49,969
"Henry Crawford chose
not to marry Maria."

1004
01:42:51,308 --> 01:42:55,053
"Mrs. Norris, who Sir Thomas
came to regard as an evil,"

1005
01:42:55,267 --> 01:42:59,806
"went to devote herself
to her... unfortunate niece."

1006
01:43:01,392 --> 01:43:07,057
"It may be supposed that their tempers
became their mutual punishment."

1007
01:43:08,392 --> 01:43:12,516
"It could have turned out differently,
I suppose."

1008
01:43:16,225 --> 01:43:19,057
"But it didn't."

1009
01:43:44,558 --> 01:43:48,173
"Mary Crawford went to live
in Westminster."

1010
01:43:48,392 --> 01:43:52,930
"Eventually, she and Henry found
partners who shared their more..."

1011
01:43:53,142 --> 01:43:56,223
"...modern sensibilities."

1012
01:44:07,183 --> 01:44:09,672
"And... as you may have guessed,"

1013
01:44:09,892 --> 01:44:15,225
"exactly when it was natural that
it should be so, not a moment sooner,"

1014
01:44:15,433 --> 01:44:20,386
"Edmund came to speak the whole
delightful... and astonishing truth."

1015
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:23,764
Fanny, I must confess something.

1016
01:44:31,892 --> 01:44:34,890
I've loved you all my life.

1017
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:37,719
I know, Edmund.

1018
01:44:43,517 --> 01:44:45,140
No, Fanny...

1019
01:44:47,058 --> 01:44:50,140
As a man loves a woman.

1020
01:44:54,808 --> 01:44:57,889
As a hero loves a heroine.

1021
01:45:02,183 --> 01:45:06,426
As I've never loved anyone
in my entire life.

1022
01:45:10,308 --> 01:45:13,969
I was so anxious to do what is right...

1023
01:45:14,933 --> 01:45:17,386
...that I forgot to do what is right.

1024
01:45:19,058 --> 01:45:21,807
But if you choose me,

1025
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:26,593
after all my blundering and blindness,

1026
01:45:29,517 --> 01:45:34,387
that will be a happiness
which no description could reach.

1027
01:45:36,058 --> 01:45:37,515
Edmund.

1028
01:46:16,308 --> 01:46:20,930
Looks as though
they're finally getting somewhere.

1029
01:46:22,725 --> 01:46:24,383
Hello!

1030
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:27,427
Julia...

1031
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:33,182
Mr... Yates?

1032
01:46:33,392 --> 01:46:39,424
Now, Joan of Arc lived
during the reign of Henry... VI?

1033
01:46:39,642 --> 01:46:42,805
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Susy.

1034
01:46:43,017 --> 01:46:46,762
I knew that, yes, I did.
I knew that.

1035
01:46:46,975 --> 01:46:50,008
"Susan came to live
at Mansfield Park."

1036
01:46:50,225 --> 01:46:52,299
"Tom grew stronger by the day."

1037
01:46:52,517 --> 01:46:56,214
"Sir Thomas eventually
abandoned his pursuits in Antigua."

1038
01:46:56,433 --> 01:47:01,671
"He chose to pursue some
exciting new opportunities in..."

1039
01:47:01,892 --> 01:47:04,013
"...tobacco."

1040
01:47:09,058 --> 01:47:13,348
"It could have all turned out differently,
I suppose."

1041
01:47:14,517 --> 01:47:16,970
"But it didn't."

1042
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:24,636
By the way,
I spoke to a John Ward at Edgerton's,

1043
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:29,140
- He said he'd be willing to publish.
- My stories?

1044
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:34,588
At our expense, of course,
but you'd keep 10% of the profits.

1045
01:47:36,017 --> 01:47:38,054
I was thinking of a title.

1046
01:47:38,267 --> 01:47:43,552
"Effusions of fancy by a very young girl
in a style entirely new."

1047
01:47:44,475 --> 01:47:48,883
- What do you think?
- That's... very interesting!

1048
01:47:50,225 --> 01:47:51,766
- Just interesting?
- It's terrible!

1049
01:47:51,975 --> 01:47:54,594
That's a terrible name!

1050
01:47:54,808 --> 01:47:57,297
But you're lovely.

1051
01:47:57,517 --> 01:48:00,550
Well, I guess that's all right, then!

1052
01:48:01,305 --> 01:48:07,283
