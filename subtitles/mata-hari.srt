2
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,235
Right.

3
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,170
Look. Is any woman worth that?

4
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:41,245
Surely, you regret having betrayed
your country.

5
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:44,510
- You can still have a chance...
- You're wasting time.

6
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:46,919
Come on, out with it.

7
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:50,650
Who is she? What is her name?

8
00:01:51,261 --> 00:01:53,991
Tell us, you fool!

9
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,994
Mata Hari.

10
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,698
That's her name, isn't it?

11
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:02,161
- Let me alone.
- Oh, shoot him.

12
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,976
She bewitches them.

13
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:10,009
Why not? She bewitched all Paris.

14
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,579
She's France's greatest enemy.

15
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:13,909
The woman has become
a mania with you, Dubois.

16
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,617
After all, you're the only one in Paris
that believes she's a spy.

17
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,955
It's very dangerous to accuse a woman
who's so powerfully protected...

18
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,789
- ...without proof.
- I'll get that proof.

19
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:30,831
And one cold morning, you'll see your fine
Mata Hari tied to one of those posts.

20
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,573
- Dine with me tonight?
- Thanks, no.

21
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,975
- Tonight I'm to see your Mata Hari dance.
- What?

22
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,876
A special soiree at LeMarchand's.

23
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,484
- How dare you.
- It's to be smart and very private.

24
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:51,552
After all, there is a war going on.

25
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,888
Oh, well, some dance and some die.

26
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:58,425
And some will do both.

27
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:14,237
- Is that it?
- I think it is, General Shubin.

28
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,970
- May I?
- Surely.

29
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:22,182
It is. Amazing.

30
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,581
Something of an event to see
a ship arrive from Russia.

31
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:31,249
Event? Why, it's the first time in history,
a flight over the German lines.

32
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,411
Congratulations. A great achievement.

33
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:57,781
Thank you, sir, but it's just sheer luck.

34
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,114
- And a good engine.
- The dispatches?

35
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,453
Quite safe, sir. I'm to deliver them
to the ambassador personally.

36
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:05,457
Yes, of course. Of course. Major.

37
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:10,190
May I present Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff
of the Russian imperial air force.

38
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,301
Proud to meet such a brave young man.

39
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:17,166
Thank you, sir. ut I was frightened
to death all the way.

40
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,369
You'll hold yourself in readiness
for a return flight to Russia...

41
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:26,140
- ...as soon as our reply is ready.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

42
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,683
- How long will it take to decode this?
- Ten to 12 hours, Your Excellency.

43
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,183
Rush it, please.

44
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:34,389
General Shubin,
please report back here tonight at 11:30.

45
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:36,855
This will call for immediate counsel.

46
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:40,560
Congratulations, lieutenant.
We shan't forget.

47
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,096
General Shubin will give you
your instructions.

48
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:53,642
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,074
Well, you feel like celebrating?

50
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:58,213
Sleep is the only thing I'm interested in.

51
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,848
Can I put you up for the night?

52
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,416
No, thank you.
I still have my little place at Passy.

53
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:05,645
That is, if I can stay awake
long enough to get there.

54
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:10,384
I'd ask you to dine with me, but I have
to go to a reception right afterwards.

55
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,888
Mata Hari's dancing.

56
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:14,593
Mata Hari?

57
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,631
I'd be delighted
to have dinner with you, sir.

58
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:22,930
- I'm not as tired as I was.
- No?

59
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,307
The prospect of a good dinner, perhaps.

60
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:27,302
Yes, I suppose that's it.

61
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:31,675
After all, it's rather absurd to go straight
to bed your first night back in Paris.

62
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,106
I think I do feel rather like celebrating.

63
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,978
If you can stay awake.

64
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:38,347
- Funny, I'm not even sleepy anymore.
- No?

65
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,416
That's all right, Rosanoff.

66
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,991
There'll be such a crowd there,
one more won't matter.

67
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:45,986
What do you mean?

68
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,827
Why, didn't you say you wanted
to see Mata Hari dance?

69
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,475
Shiva...

70
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:42,649
...I dance for you tonight as the bayadères
danced in the sacred temples of Java.

71
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,877
ravo!

72
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,142
ravo!

73
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,882
They say her mother was a sacred dancer,
her father a temple priest.

74
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,756
You know she married a Dutchman.
My dear, he used to beat her.

75
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:02,624
Really? I can't believe it.

76
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:04,789
She makes matrimony seem so dull.

77
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,264
I'd like to know her.

78
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,130
I feel that I do know her.

79
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:25,214
Madame Mata Hari, may a perfect stranger
offer her appreciation?

80
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,618
- Thank you.
- Your costume was exquisite.

81
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,054
And those earrings, are they Javanese?

82
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,988
No, they are from India.

83
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,651
They're so intriguing. May I?

84
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:37,724
Andriani wants to see you at the Pavilion
at once. It's very important.

85
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,299
- Glad you like them.
- Thank you.

86
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,069
Do you think...? Could you introduce me?

87
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,904
My dear boy, one doesn't meet Mata Hari
on the spur of the moment like that.

88
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:50,578
esides, I'm late now.

89
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:53,715
- Do you mind if I stay for a while?
- No, no. Not at all.

90
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,908
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

91
00:08:56,652 --> 00:09:00,554
- I thought you were different from the rest.
- Champagne, please.

92
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:04,159
Take this for me. I know what you like.

93
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:07,694
I know all about men like you...

94
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,926
Permit me, mademoiselle.

95
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:18,300
- Oh, wasn't she marvelous?
- Wasn't that a wonderful dance, monsieur?

96
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,136
It wasn't a dance, it was a poem.

97
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,437
- Do you know her?
- Who doesn't?

98
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,478
I would give my right arm to meet her.

99
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,878
So would I.

100
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,843
- To Mata Hari the incomparable.
- Unsurpassed.

101
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,148
- Priestess of the dance.
- High priestess.

102
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,655
- Goddess. Goddess of beauty.
- ravo.

103
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:39,589
The dancer is only as beautiful
as the mood of her dance.

104
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,855
- To Mata Hari.
- To Mata Hari.

105
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:48,036
Now, gentleman, I'm terribly tired.
You'll have to excuse me.

106
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:52,234
You've been very, very charming.
I thank you.

107
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:54,565
Good night, my lady.

108
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:57,474
Good night. Good night.

109
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:05,381
- Marvelous.
- Why, of course.

110
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,984
Have you ever seen people's faces
when you dance?

111
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:12,056
Have you any idea of the effect
you have on them?

112
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,288
My mind is so far away when I dance.

113
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,792
I live in another age.

114
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:19,891
Centuries back...

115
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,505
...when man and woman...

116
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:36,718
randy is bad for your heart.

117
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,786
I thought you'd given it up.

118
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:43,316
I give up a lot of things,
but I take them back.

119
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,488
To me, anything I like is irresistible.

120
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:51,364
I've always been that way.
Unfortunately, it's in my blood.

121
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,298
What people you Russians are.

122
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:57,401
What charming savages.

123
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,336
Come in.

124
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,769
- The Marquis de Signac.
- Wait. We're going to the Pavilion.

125
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,345
- Pavilion?
- Yes.

126
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,108
I like gambling.

127
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,344
They laugh, it's gay there.

128
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,249
Gay? With Signac?

129
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,754
- Is that necessary?
- Why not?

130
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,656
He's very attractive, young.

131
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,028
Of course, he's not a general
of the Russian imperial army...

132
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,766
...so important as you.

133
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:29,127
- A diplomat...
- Or a traitor.

134
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:31,372
I said it, traitor.

135
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,509
- Now, quiet, Serge.
- The time has come when I can't be quiet.

136
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,842
There's something growing here that's
going to make me shout out...

137
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,641
...the whole truth one day.

138
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:43,078
You want to die so badly?

139
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:45,486
I'm dead now.

140
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:50,249
Just as surely as though there were
a bullet in my heart.

141
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:52,853
You killed me.

142
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,360
No. The brandy.

143
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:58,398
No, no, no. You.

144
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:00,292
Then why don't you give me up?

145
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,700
- I will.
- Well, do.

146
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,407
Come in.

147
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,073
- So you're going to the Pavilion?
- Yes.

148
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:12,578
- Much gambling.
- Caron, are you coming with us?

149
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,081
Sorry, my dear,
but I have to be in court at 9.

150
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,276
- Most important case.
- Too bad, too bad.

151
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:20,422
- Shubin?
- Madame, I must be leaving.

152
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,955
I'm due at the embassy now.

153
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,796
Good night.

154
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:31,723
Good night, general.

155
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:37,072
- Tonight, late supper?
- No.

156
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:38,933
Tonight.

157
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:42,006
I thought it was all over.

158
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:44,708
Well, tomorrow, then.

159
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:48,212
I must help you to give me up.

160
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,045
Please, tomorrow.

161
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:54,552
Good night, General Shubin.

162
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:56,623
Good night.

163
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,654
Madame Mata Hari's car!

164
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,010
To the Pavilion.

165
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,428
To the Pavilion.

166
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:54,813
Eight.

167
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:56,614
Ten.

168
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,985
Four thousand francs.

169
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:11,393
Here you are, sir.

170
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,225
I have charted all gun emplacements
and air batteries.

171
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:17,702
- Good. You were attached to me as a cook?
- Yes, sir.

172
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,640
- Technical expert, eh?
- Yes, sir.

173
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,936
- With the rank of captain.
- That's right, sir.

174
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,444
- You're a good soldier?
- I hope so.

175
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,548
- And a good German?
- Yes, sir.

176
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,048
Some months ago, I furnished you
with plans and specifications...

177
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,915
...of a new weapon called the tank.

178
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,455
- Oh, yes, yes.
- You laughed at it, said it was impractical.

179
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,853
That's my belief, sir.

180
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:42,259
Well, captain, those impractical tanks
went into action in the Somme yesterday...

181
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,629
...costing your country 20 kilometers
of front and 18,000 casualties.

182
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,669
- Impossible.
- So you said before.

183
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:56,177
Here are a few more of your
mistaken conclusions.

184
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,772
Correct them.

185
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:22,671
- Send Mademoiselle Carlotta here.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:52,323
Well, I was able to deliver
your message, Andriani.

187
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,200
Mata Hari is here.

188
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,736
Thank you, Carlotta.
That's what I wanted to know.

189
00:15:56,905 --> 00:16:01,035
- Any more orders?
- No. No, just run along and enjoy yourself.

190
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:04,037
All right. Good night.

191
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,313
Dear lady.

192
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,045
Oh, good evening.

193
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,553
Won't you have my seat?

194
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:18,249
It's lucky.
It will be so much nicer to watch you.

195
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:20,859
- Thank you.
- A thousand francs for the bank.

196
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,362
- Two thousand.
- Ten thousand.

197
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,557
- Ten thousand.
- Ten thousand.

198
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,723
Madame.

199
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,368
Are you playing?

200
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:30,266
Never against you.

201
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,101
Any more bets?

202
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:34,572
Leon. Monsieur Leon.

203
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,643
- Oui, madame.
- I want some chips for this.

204
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:39,246
I'm sorry, madame.
We do not accept jewelry.

205
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:41,880
Perhaps one of the players.

206
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:43,648
You take it, madame.

207
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,750
He paid 10,000 francs for it.

208
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,888
Who paid 10,000 francs?

209
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,858
Whoever he was, he paid 10,000 for it.

210
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,989
I'll sell it for 5.

211
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:55,289
He had very good taste.

212
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,791
- It's an unusual ring.
- May I buy it for you?

213
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,500
It's bought.

214
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,668
- Going?
- Wait. I may be back.

215
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:07,364
Thank you.

216
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,801
Still 4000 in the bank.

217
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:19,815
Well, you're looking magnificent tonight,
my dear.

218
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:22,690
Last time I seemed only beautiful to you.

219
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,418
You must have something very difficult
for me tonight.

220
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:29,826
No, it shouldn't be for you. Important
dispatches have arrived from Russia.

221
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,928
All right. I'm having supper
with Shubin tomorrow night.

222
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:36,299
Splendid. Splendid. Why not tonight?

223
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,037
He's at the embassy.

224
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,743
- A conference.
- Probably concerns these dispatches.

225
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,445
- Probably.
- Then tomorrow night won't do.

226
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,046
You must see Shubin
the minute he returns.

227
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:51,243
- I have arranged differently.
- Then change your arrangements.

228
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:54,612
I think you should handle Shubin yourself.

229
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,981
You get along beautifully.

230
00:17:57,392 --> 00:18:00,327
- You're so alike.
- This is no time for any of your moods.

231
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,394
Something vital may be involved in this.

232
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,690
Something vital is involved in it.

233
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:08,002
- Good night, Andriani.
- Then I insist you see Shubin tonight.

234
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,661
A car will be waiting for you
when you leave here.

235
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:14,065
You also insisted on that submarine job.

236
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:17,542
You finally had to do it yourself,
as far as I remember.

237
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,670
How well you did it.

238
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:24,308
I intend to do a better job in finding out who
informed the French authorities about it.

239
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:27,578
Of course, there's Carlotta, she knew.

240
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:30,554
- And you knew.
- And so did you.

241
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,458
You don't trust me, do you?

242
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:35,694
Yes. Yes.

243
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:39,196
ut you're capricious.
You're a little bit mad.

244
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,303
You might give me away just
for the excitement of the thing.

245
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,132
You might get me killed.

246
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,501
Unless I kill you first.

247
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:50,373
Hadn't you better wait
until after tomorrow night?

248
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,709
A car will be waiting for you tonight.

249
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:07,918
Madame.

250
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,599
I beg your pardon.
I saw you admire this ring...

251
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,395
...and I thought perhaps
you would like to have it.

252
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,069
Why?

253
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,510
Well, as a token
of my admiration for you.

254
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,062
How charming.

255
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:43,324
eautiful.

256
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:51,239
Madame, the car you ordered is waiting.

257
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,135
I won't need it. This young man
has offered to take me home.

258
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,845
Good night, Andriani.

259
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:16,195
- No, no, no.
- Just for a little while.

260
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,491
- No, no further.
- Please, don't say that.

261
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:23,668
I think you're very absurd,
very persistent and...

262
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,707
- Very nice? Thank you.
- And very Russian.

263
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,073
Now, go home.

264
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:33,481
I'm afraid of losing what I've found.

265
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,472
Meaning?

266
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,380
You.

267
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,599
Hadn't you better take that off?

268
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,301
As long as you insist upon staying.

269
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,933
For a little while.

270
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,909
How long have you been in Paris?

271
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,809
I flew from London this morning.

272
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,252
I saw you once in the ois.

273
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,352
You were so lovely.

274
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:25,429
I watched you till you drove out
of sight among the chestnut blossoms.

275
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:28,129
Oh, Paris in the spring.

276
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,037
Spring.

277
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:31,636
And now I'm here.

278
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,741
- With you.
- ut it's autumn.

279
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,307
ut perhaps next spring,
the war will be over...

280
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:41,475
- ...you and I...
- I never look ahead.

281
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:47,386
y next spring,
I shall probably be quite alone.

282
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,189
Never alone again.

283
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,488
I mean, at least my thoughts
will always be with you.

284
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,995
No, you mustn't.

285
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:04,667
ut you are so beautiful.

286
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:36,436
This is absurd.

287
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,899
I am going to bed.

288
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,407
Don't speak.

289
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,448
Good night.

290
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:55,572
- Madame, the hairdresser can take you.
- I'm too nervous.

291
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:59,713
- And the marquis is calling for you.
- I'm too tired, Marie.

292
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:03,618
- And aron Michel telephoned.
- Oh, I'm not interested, really.

293
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,850
Mata.

294
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,891
Mata.

295
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:13,158
- ut, no, sir.
- It's perfectly all right.

296
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:21,000
For the loveliest lady in all France.

297
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:24,542
I had to see you.

298
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,308
It seemed like wasting life to sleep.

299
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,545
You're even more beautiful
than I remembered you.

300
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:36,955
- Why did you come here?
- I couldn't help it.

301
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:41,391
Out there, the birds were singing, and there
was a softness in the air just like spring.

302
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,794
And you were the song of the birds
and the warm brightness of the morning.

303
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,926
- It's very nice but...
- My heart was so full of you...

304
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:52,470
...I had to come back and tell you I love you
and take you to lunch.

305
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:54,666
It's almost 2:00
and I have an appointment.

306
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:57,368
ut you can break it.
I must take you to lunch.

307
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:00,774
- I told you I have an appointment.
- And I told you to break it.

308
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,313
You're a fool.

309
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,411
The most conceited fool I've ever known.

310
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:09,279
Mata.

311
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:12,353
What makes you think you have
the right to burst in here?

312
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,662
I'm sorry. ut last night
you told me that you loved me.

313
00:25:16,164 --> 00:25:17,756
Oh, did I?

314
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:19,924
Well, that was last night.

315
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,167
Today I am very busy.

316
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:24,437
Marie.

317
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:28,441
- Yes, madame.
- The gentleman is leaving.

318
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:32,309
You are quite right. I have been a fool.

319
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:35,376
I won't make this mistake again.

320
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:18,883
Still a peasant, Ivan, huh?

321
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,527
Still superstitious.

322
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:23,528
Evil spirits come in on the wind.

323
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:28,826
There's Madame Mata Hari.

324
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,569
Leave that alone.
Hurry up, open the door.

325
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,966
Go on.

326
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,180
Monsieur Dubois.

327
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,084
Dubois?

328
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:49,049
What on earth can he want?

329
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,921
Tell him...
Tell him I can't see him.

330
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:56,628
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

331
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:59,631
Tell him...

332
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:02,235
...that I shall be delighted.

333
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:04,496
My dear Dubois.

334
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:06,368
I'm afraid I'm intruding.

335
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,408
And inwardly you must be saying,
"Confound this man Dubois".

336
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:12,137
- No. No, not at all, but...
- I'll be brief.

337
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:14,544
And if I seem to touch
on matters that are...

338
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,685
...how shall I say it,
too intimate, you must forgive me...

339
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:19,911
- ...it is because of my duty.
- Yes?

340
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:22,520
You are very friendly with a lady...

341
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:25,387
...perhaps the same one
that you are expecting tonight.

342
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,625
Well, what if I am?

343
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,958
We consider this woman
a very grave danger.

344
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:35,498
And as you know her better
than anyone else, we want you to help us.

345
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,667
Why, what are you talking about?

346
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,008
- I'm expecting Mata Hari.
- Exactly.

347
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,869
And Mata Hari is a spy.

348
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:46,070
- In the pay of the Wilhelmstrasse.
- A spy.

349
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,408
Oh, my dear Dubois.

350
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,983
- Now you insult my intelligence.
- Please.

351
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:53,643
Either that or you've lost your mind.

352
00:27:53,822 --> 00:27:55,881
I'm quite sane, I assure you.

353
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:58,557
Well, if she's a spy,
why don't you arrest her?

354
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,924
ecause I need definite proof.
And that's why I am here.

355
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:05,461
This is an absolute joke.

356
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:09,731
It's really too good, you know.

357
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:12,438
Mata Hari, a spy.

358
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:19,644
You know, for a moment,
I almost took you seriously.

359
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:23,614
Well, if the joke is as good as that,
I'd like to hear it.

360
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,912
Or maybe it's too bad for me to hear.

361
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:29,454
No, no, no. Our poor friend Dubois here...

362
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,184
...says that you are a spy.

363
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,528
Well, of course I am.

364
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:37,057
Everyone is Paris knows that.

365
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,500
Even Dubois, who knows everything.

366
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:46,106
- Couldn't you guess, Shubin?
- No, I think I'm getting old and stupid.

367
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,899
As I've amused you both so much...

368
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:51,045
- ...perhaps I need not apologize.
- Please don't misunderstand...

369
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,305
I don't. Evidently, I'm mistaken.

370
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,709
Good night, madame.

371
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:57,943
I'm very sorry you found it necessary
to put me in this position.

372
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,416
I spoke in confidence.

373
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:00,982
- Good night.
- Good night.

374
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,990
Please don't misunderstand,
the whole thing was a joke.

375
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:37,914
Mother in heaven, I'm done for.

376
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:39,821
I'm finished.

377
00:29:39,994 --> 00:29:41,461
What did he say?

378
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:45,326
He said that you were a spy
and that I was your...

379
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,525
- What else?
- Nothing else.

380
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,136
I'm sure he suspects.

381
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:52,872
Well, he wouldn't come here
if he suspected you.

382
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,168
It's me he's after. You're quite safe.

383
00:29:55,376 --> 00:30:00,575
ut he must know something. Why should
he come here at 11:00 at night?

384
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:06,082
The chief of the spy bureau.
It's a trap, of course.

385
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:08,979
Don't be ridiculous.

386
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,780
Ridiculous?

387
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:12,793
Ridiculous.

388
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,586
Oh, what a fool I've been.

389
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:17,559
Nothing mattered.

390
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:22,027
Honor, self-respect, everything gone.

391
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,734
ecause of you.

392
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,805
You can't give away like this.

393
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,498
- Dubois knows nothing.
- He knows nothing.

394
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,505
Here I am facing dishonor,
perhaps death...

395
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,671
...and it means nothing to you.

396
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:37,543
You haven't even a word of pity for me.

397
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,850
You're all unstrung, Serge.

398
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,750
Nothing's happened.

399
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:43,956
Look at it calmly.

400
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,022
Laugh at it.

401
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,224
We'll laugh at it together.

402
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,926
When you hold me like this,
nothing seems to matter.

403
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:58,566
Nothing in the world.

404
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,705
This must never leave your hands...

405
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:06,108
...till you have delivered it personally
to the prime minister. That is vital.

406
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,213
Should you be forced down
in enemy territory...

407
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:13,184
...pull this cord, and the contents
will be completely destroyed.

408
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:14,582
I understand.

409
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:18,157
The officials at Le ourget Field
will telephone you at your rooms...

410
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,453
...as soon as flying is possible.

411
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,856
It is imperative...

412
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,126
...that these dispatches be in Petrograd
as soon as human means can contrive.

413
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,563
Yes, Your Excellency.

414
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:30,431
Mr. Palin will have these sealed
and delivered to you.

415
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:33,165
And now, goodbye and good luck.

416
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,308
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Lieutenant.

417
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:39,776
On your way, inquire if General Shubin
has any further instructions.

418
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,706
Don't be so secretive.

419
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:46,846
I know that the embassy has received
important news from Russia.

420
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:49,888
Please, don't ask me things.

421
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:51,624
Not tonight.

422
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,886
ut all you've got to say is yes or no.

423
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:00,627
Well, at least you can tell me
how they came, by courier?

424
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,400
- No.
- y wireless, then.

425
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:06,968
No.

426
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,775
y airplane.

427
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,940
The airplane from Russia?

428
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:14,680
No.

429
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:19,515
Please, don't ask me anything more.

430
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,681
I can't stand it.

431
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:26,622
I can't get that Dubois out of my head.

432
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:30,029
Well, maybe you'd rather be alone.

433
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:33,789
You might as well be.
Your thoughts are not with me.

434
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:36,732
My thoughts are with you always.

435
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,528
Are they?

436
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,673
Is that why you haven't kissed
me for hours?

437
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:44,076
Oh, Mata.

438
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,345
What is it?

439
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:52,885
Lieutenant Rosanoff.

440
00:33:01,129 --> 00:33:04,064
Come in. Come in.

441
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:10,163
May I present Lieutenant Rosanoff.
Madame Mata Hari.

442
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:12,469
I believe we've met before.

443
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,104
I don't think so, madame.

444
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:15,707
Well, what is it?

445
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,567
I'm flying back tonight, sir.

446
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:20,781
I am to inquire if you have
any further orders.

447
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:24,879
I don't believe so.

448
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,279
Surely you are not thinking
of flying in this weather?

449
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,649
Rosanoff!

450
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:33,157
- Yes, sir.
- Madame spoke to you.

451
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:34,555
I know it, sir.

452
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:35,855
Oh, never mind.

453
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,933
You can't expect monsieur to answer
chatter with a flight for Russia on his mind.

454
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,402
Safe voyage, monsieur.
Come back to us soon.

455
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,636
Paris in the spring...

456
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,370
...with all those chestnut blossoms.

457
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,479
Good night, monsieur.

458
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:55,977
Lieutenant.

459
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:57,614
Yes, sir.

460
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:03,356
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, sir.

461
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:04,991
Madame spoke to you.

462
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:06,983
There was nothing to answer.

463
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:08,856
You're insolent.

464
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,831
- I advise you to return to your quarters.
- Yes, sir.

465
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,595
Impudent fool.

466
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,534
I really can't apologize enough for him.

467
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,803
He must have been drinking.

468
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:27,313
I thought he was quite nice.

469
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,211
And brave.

470
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:33,051
Flying all the way to Russia.

471
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:39,822
Well, this time you didn't have
to tell me anything, did you?

472
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:42,594
Your conscience is quite clear.

473
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:03,640
I can't believe they'd send a dispatch
that you know nothing about.

474
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:08,151
I've told you, I have nothing
to do with political matters.

475
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,918
Mata, if you don't help me forget...

476
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:17,291
...this ghastly business for a few hours,
I'm going insane.

477
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,831
Of course you should forget them.

478
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,901
We both will.

479
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,334
Well, doesn't matter.

480
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:31,176
- He wouldn't dare.
- Who wouldn't dare?

481
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:32,810
Dubois.

482
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,672
What about him?

483
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:39,085
I was only thinking if he were to search
my rooms while I am here...

484
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,982
What are you driving at?

485
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:42,946
It doesn't matter.

486
00:35:43,758 --> 00:35:46,727
ut those official figures
that you sent me...

487
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,521
You haven't destroyed them?

488
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:52,129
- Not yet.
- How could you be so careless?

489
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:57,463
I suppose it was a little careless,
but they're safely hidden away.

490
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:01,972
ut Dubois may be there now.
It may be too late.

491
00:36:02,476 --> 00:36:04,068
You must go.

492
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:09,209
I wouldn't think of leaving you
for something that can't possibly happen.

493
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:11,710
Please, I can't stand it.

494
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,416
Come.

495
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:17,624
I'd go myself, but I'm sure
they're watching the house.

496
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,722
Please, now, don't lose a moment.

497
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:25,923
Telephone me the moment
that you've destroyed them.

498
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,625
- Not safe.
- Well, then come back here.

499
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:31,237
Of course I will.

500
00:36:31,405 --> 00:36:34,306
Don't worry.

501
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,864
- Hey, get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

502
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,474
ack up! ack up! ack up, will you!

503
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,247
Good evening, Mother Durand.

504
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:52,215
Come quick.

505
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:01,884
Call Andriani.

506
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:06,723
Tell him to send -14
to Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff's at once.

507
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:09,333
Right here is the address.

508
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,572
He must wait outside...

509
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:37,628
Am I allowed to come in?

510
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:46,265
Why did you come here?

511
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:48,072
To see you.

512
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:50,171
You finished your rendezvous early.

513
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:52,778
No, I ran away from it.

514
00:38:52,947 --> 00:38:54,209
Why?

515
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:56,782
ecause of you.

516
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,953
I'm afraid that Shubin was furious.

517
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:09,292
- I can't make you out.
- I can't either.

518
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,265
Are you still angry?

519
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,258
Haven't I the right to be?

520
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,528
- This morning you acted like...
- I can explain.

521
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:19,070
And tonight I find you alone with Shubin.

522
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,107
Alexis, don't think wrong of me.

523
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,507
Artists need help and influence.

524
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,744
And Shubin can do
so much to help my career.

525
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,381
- So I can imagine.
- ut we are nothing to each other.

526
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,990
Please be glad to see me.

527
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:51,132
Are you sorry I came?

528
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,332
No.

529
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,741
Well, then, look at me.

530
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,919
Please.

531
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:14,450
Please forgive me.

532
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:32,139
Nice character in this room.

533
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,951
- This is the czar, isn't it?
- Yes.

534
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,680
- Who's the old gentleman there?
- My father.

535
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,827
I like his face.

536
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:50,191
- And this Madonna?
- The Madonna of Kazan'.

537
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,058
My mother made a pilgrimage
to the Shrine of Miracles to get it for me.

538
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:56,902
It's about 100 miles from our town.

539
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:59,062
She walked all the way.

540
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,697
What is it supposed to do?

541
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:06,176
- ring you luck?
- Oh, no. It guards you from evil.

542
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,174
I had to kneel before the altar...

543
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:11,876
...and promise Mother I would always
keep a flame burning before it.

544
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:14,213
- And have you?
- Of course.

545
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:18,381
My orderly has taken care of it
all the time I've been away.

546
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:21,984
You're a strange boy.

547
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,088
Who loves you.

548
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:25,929
Do you?

549
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,197
I love you as one adores sacred things.

550
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:33,397
What sacred things?

551
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,440
God...

552
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:37,236
...country...

553
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,969
...honor...

554
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:40,545
...you.

555
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,978
- I come last?
- No.

556
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,584
- That's how you said it.
- You come first.

557
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:47,719
efore anything.

558
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,751
efore...

559
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,654
...anything?

560
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,162
Yes.

561
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:05,167
There is so much light in here.

562
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,618
Put out that one too.

563
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,001
- The Madonna's lamp?
- Yes.

564
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:39,664
I couldn't do that.

565
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,603
You said I came first.

566
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,141
ut don't you understand
that it's a holy lamp?

567
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:47,376
That I swore to keep it burning?

568
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:50,642
You wouldn't do that for me?

569
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:53,348
Why? Why do you ask me to?

570
00:42:54,922 --> 00:42:58,858
- To see if you love me as you say.
- I do, Mata. I do.

571
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:02,127
Well, then put it out.

572
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,995
If you love me.

573
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:11,165
I'll do anything,
but please don't ask me to do that.

574
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,206
- I'm going.
- No.

575
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:38,622
Forgive me.

576
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:19,460
Steady.

577
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:29,743
Steady.

578
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:34,086
You are still here, sir.

579
00:48:34,261 --> 00:48:36,388
- And they didn't telephone?
- Yes, someone did.

580
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:39,623
- Then the plans have been changed.
- I didn't answer. Get me a taxi.

581
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,496
- You didn't answer? Why not?
- I told you to get me a taxi.

582
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,933
If anyone calls, you tell them I'm out.
Quickly!

583
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,663
Yes, sir.

584
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:17,159
- Lieutenant Rosanoff?
- Gone out.

585
00:49:17,337 --> 00:49:19,669
- This is his servant.
- Where'd Rosanoff go?

586
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,435
- He went to the embassy a long time ago.
- Impossible. We just came from there.

587
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:25,942
- Then he must have met with an accident.
- ut when?

588
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:28,673
- Oh, these Paris taxis.
- Come on.

589
00:49:29,082 --> 00:49:31,607
I hope it's not a bad accident.

590
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,920
I have to see her.
I'll wait here till I do see her.

591
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:37,488
Madame Mata Hari is not in.

592
00:49:37,658 --> 00:49:39,182
- Where is she?
- I don't know, sir.

593
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,851
- Where would she be? Who are her friends?
- I don't know. Where would she be?

594
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,827
Where would she be?

595
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,630
- General Shubin's?
- I've told you, sir, I don't know.

596
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:52,370
All right.

597
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:57,805
While I know you'll hate to leave Paris,
I must ask you to go on a little mission.

598
00:49:58,011 --> 00:50:01,003
- Yes? Where?
- To Marseilles.

599
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:04,642
- Marseilles?
- Yes.

600
00:50:04,818 --> 00:50:07,150
Oh, no. Don't do that to me, Andriani.

601
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,447
Think of how I've served,
the work I've done.

602
00:50:09,623 --> 00:50:11,682
- Have pity on me.
- No, no. There's no need...

603
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:13,223
...of you becoming hysterical.

604
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:16,726
You're simply being ordered to Marseilles
to meet our Spanish agent.

605
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:20,025
- What is so terrifying about that?
- It means my number's up. I know.

606
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,260
You think I'm a traitor. I'm not.
I'll swear by everything I hold sacred.

607
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,462
And what do you hold sacred?

608
00:50:26,573 --> 00:50:28,473
There's a train tonight.

609
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:31,703
rille has your tickets.

610
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:33,470
l won't go.

611
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:37,810
l won't go meekly to be slaughtered.

612
00:50:37,984 --> 00:50:40,179
Remember, this is Paris,
not the Wilhelmstrasse.

613
00:50:40,353 --> 00:50:43,288
If you force me to be a traitor,
I'll go to the French police...

614
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,187
...and tell them everything I know.
They'll protect me.

615
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:48,554
You ought to know.

616
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,643
Jacques.

617
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,536
Now, now, now. What's the matter, dearie?
Not feeling well?

618
00:51:41,314 --> 00:51:43,214
Hello, Mata.

619
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:47,144
Well, if everybody obeyed orders
as loyally as you do...

620
00:51:47,554 --> 00:51:48,953
Thank you.

621
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,856
- Any further orders for me?
- Yes.

622
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,221
Yes, here are the photographs
of the dispatches.

623
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:59,730
Take that to Shubin and have him send
them in the first diplomatic mail to Holland.

624
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,561
Very well.

625
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:07,267
- You don't seem to be in very good humor.
- No.

626
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,001
l'd think your success of last evening
should put you in the very best of spirits.

627
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:13,476
- To the contrary.
- Why?

628
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:17,276
Surely, a simple job like that
needn't have been unpleasant.

629
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:19,384
Most unpleasant.

630
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:21,048
He's in love with me.

631
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,746
Well, that's not unusual.

632
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,954
He wants me to marry him.

633
00:52:26,293 --> 00:52:28,625
Not really? Marry...

634
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:30,353
Well...

635
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,490
Why is that so funny?

636
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:42,538
- What is it?
- We are dispensing with Carlotta's services.

637
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:45,075
She seems to resent it.

638
00:52:49,216 --> 00:52:50,774
Poor Carlotta.

639
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:52,976
She shouldn't have fallen in love.

640
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,049
l've warned her and you
about that before.

641
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:02,594
l am surprised she didn't respect
your wishes in the matter.

642
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:04,820
She was afraid of you.

643
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:07,330
Ours is an exacting profession.

644
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:12,502
We're permitted no friends, no emotions,
no personal life of our own.

645
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:14,230
What are you driving at?

646
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,805
I'm simply reminding
you that a spy in love...

647
00:53:17,978 --> 00:53:21,539
...is a tool that has outlived
its usefulness.

648
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:25,677
You're so subtle.
You imagine that I am in love?

649
00:53:25,852 --> 00:53:30,414
Well, I did think for a moment that you were
taking this Rosanoff a little too seriously.

650
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,956
l never expect to see Rosanoff again.

651
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:35,460
l never want to.

652
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,823
ut it's not because I'm worried
by any threats of yours.

653
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:42,559
ut I want you to see him again.

654
00:53:42,736 --> 00:53:45,261
He may continue
to be very, very useful to us.

655
00:53:45,438 --> 00:53:46,735
- Not to me.
- ut...

656
00:53:46,907 --> 00:53:49,967
I don't ever want to touch
that boy's life again.

657
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:26,110
Hello.

658
00:54:26,646 --> 00:54:27,908
What?

659
00:54:28,148 --> 00:54:29,445
Yes.

660
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:32,410
He did not report to the flying field?

661
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,948
Tell His Excellency I'll be there
as quickly as possible.

662
00:54:37,824 --> 00:54:40,349
- lvan! My tunic.
- Yes, sir.

663
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,222
Hurry, hurry.

664
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:46,697
l knew this was going to be
an unlucky day when I woke up.

665
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:51,602
Put it down. Put it down!

666
00:54:52,605 --> 00:54:56,837
Get me a dozen orchids and take them
to Madame Mata Hari.

667
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,036
Take this note along with it.
Meet me at the embassy.

668
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,805
Yes, sir.

669
00:55:05,352 --> 00:55:07,547
Monsieur Dubois.

670
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:09,748
Good morning, my friend.

671
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:13,150
- Good morning.
- Oh, no. No one would ever forgive that.

672
00:55:13,326 --> 00:55:16,557
To spoil a man's supper,
then come back and spoil his breakfast.

673
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,721
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

674
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:23,534
- Well, what is it today? More melodrama?
- No, no.

675
00:55:23,703 --> 00:55:27,469
- Today it is a farce.
- Oh, indeed. I see.

676
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,269
Last night I was bold enough
to hint at a relationship...

677
00:55:31,444 --> 00:55:34,277
...between you and a certain lady.
And I've come to apologize...

678
00:55:34,447 --> 00:55:38,144
...because I was mistaken.
Oh, yes, because I discovered...

679
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,879
...that this lady's inclinations
are entirely elsewhere.

680
00:55:42,222 --> 00:55:43,849
- Oh, yes?
- Oh, yes.

681
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,818
We older men merely furnish the soft lights
and champagne.

682
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,357
The mood, as it were.

683
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:54,466
Youth whistles, and we? We spend
the rest of the evening reading a book.

684
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:57,768
Just what are you trying to get at?

685
00:55:57,971 --> 00:56:02,032
Merely this, that Mata Hari went straight
to the rooms of young Rosanoff...

686
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:05,970
...when she left here last night.
And the previous night, he was with her.

687
00:56:06,146 --> 00:56:08,410
ln what way does this concern me?

688
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:13,018
Well, it doesn't. It merely illustrates
what a fool I made of myself.

689
00:56:13,186 --> 00:56:14,551
Yes, yes.

690
00:56:14,721 --> 00:56:18,748
Well, if you will pardon me, I have a most
important engagement at the embassy.

691
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:21,086
I'm very sorry to detain you.
It's stupid of me.

692
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:23,889
ut I had to drop in
and apologize for my silly mistake.

693
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:26,430
- Very kind of you. Yes, charming.
- Good morning.

694
00:56:56,596 --> 00:56:59,156
- Did it work?
- I don't know yet. He seemed calm enough.

695
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:02,665
ut there may be quite
an interesting reaction. We shall see.

696
00:57:11,077 --> 00:57:12,669
Shubin?

697
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:14,636
Shubin?

698
00:57:16,282 --> 00:57:17,681
What's happened?

699
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,512
A private air raid?

700
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,983
You cheat.

701
00:57:21,154 --> 00:57:25,318
- You liar.
- "Good morning, liar" would be more polite.

702
00:57:25,492 --> 00:57:28,825
- e quiet, you...
- We'll omit the pet names.

703
00:57:28,995 --> 00:57:31,429
- Come to the point.
- Rosanoff. That's the point.

704
00:57:31,598 --> 00:57:35,295
You were with him all last night.
Dubois told me.

705
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:38,437
How does he know?
Did he look through the keyhole?

706
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:41,597
- Don't deny it.
- I don't.

707
00:57:41,908 --> 00:57:46,208
Of course I was with him.
He had information I wanted, and I got it.

708
00:57:46,513 --> 00:57:47,878
That's all.

709
00:57:56,623 --> 00:58:00,024
You didn't think I went there
because of...?

710
00:58:02,128 --> 00:58:04,961
Can't you understand why Dubois
is doing this?

711
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,526
- He knows what you mean to me.
- You're lying.

712
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:11,693
You love that boy, and I know it.

713
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:15,201
Would I have taken this if I loved him?

714
00:58:15,508 --> 00:58:16,736
What is it?

715
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,734
Photographs of his dispatches to Russia.

716
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:22,742
Doesn't that convince you?

717
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:39,894
Yes, I'm quite convinced.
Convinced it's not the whole truth.

718
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:43,263
What about the night before last?
Did he have the dispatches then?

719
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:46,200
No, he did not have the dispatches then.

720
00:58:46,372 --> 00:58:51,071
ut he had you, huh?
That's what Dubois said.

721
00:58:51,244 --> 00:58:53,576
We older men supply the champagne.

722
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:58,513
ut when youth sings, the old fool
stays home and pays the piper.

723
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,018
That's what Dubois said.

724
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:03,019
Hello.

725
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,416
- Wagram-600.
- What are you doing?

726
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:10,757
I think it's only fair to apologize to Dubois.
After all, he was right, you know.

727
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:13,666
Hello, Monsieur Dubois?

728
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,198
Who's calling?

729
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:16,699
Hold the wire.

730
00:59:16,936 --> 00:59:18,733
General Shubin on number three.

731
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,609
Yes? Dubois speaking.

732
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,781
Will you please repeat that?
l didn't quite hear you.

733
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,577
You were right. She is a spy.

734
00:59:32,919 --> 00:59:35,513
I'll give you all the proof you want.

735
00:59:35,722 --> 00:59:37,815
Well, come over! She's here.

736
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,618
I'll keep her here.

737
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:46,126
Get me a car quick.
At last, I've got Mata Hari.

738
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:48,358
You've been cheating men all your life.

739
00:59:48,534 --> 00:59:53,062
ut there'll be 12 men you won't cheat,
the firing squad.

740
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:55,972
No firing squad for me, Shubin.

741
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:58,967
lt'll be your word against mine.

742
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:01,975
And after all, I have friends.

743
01:00:02,548 --> 01:00:05,642
Paris will laugh at you.
A jealous, hysterical fool.

744
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:10,312
Perhaps not. You and Rosanoff may get
out of this, but I don't think so.

745
01:00:11,557 --> 01:00:13,115
Rosanoff?

746
01:00:13,459 --> 01:00:15,984
- And what has he to do with it?
- Everything.

747
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:20,222
Rosanoff is a traitor. He permitted you
to copy his dispatches.

748
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,163
- That's not true.
- Fortunately...

749
01:00:22,335 --> 01:00:25,702
...this time it isn't a question
of anyone's word. I have proof.

750
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:29,164
Proof that you gave me yourself.

751
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:35,239
You've stood that boy against a wall,
just as surely as you're standing there.

752
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:38,974
l never knew that anyone
could be so vile.

753
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:42,380
Vile? Not at all, madame,
I'm simply doing my duty.

754
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:46,457
How ironic, you love a man
and send him to his death.

755
01:00:48,094 --> 01:00:49,322
Hello.

756
01:00:49,495 --> 01:00:51,656
- Official-27.
- Don't do it, Shubin.

757
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:53,093
l beg you not to do it.

758
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:55,392
Hello? His Excellency's secretary, please.

759
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:59,504
- Leave him out of this. He's innocent.
- Hello, this is General Shubin speaking...

760
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:02,698
- ...l must speak to His Excellency at once.
- I'm warning you.

761
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:05,605
- Don't, don't do it!
- Hello, Your Excellency?

762
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:07,575
I'm coming to the embassy at once.

763
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,011
l must speak to you
on a most urgent matter.

764
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:12,208
Shubin, if you don't stop...

765
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,885
- Hello, Excellency?
- Shubin!

766
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:18,820
I'll explain when I arrive. ln the meantime,
order the immediate arrest of...

767
01:02:34,467 --> 01:02:36,094
- What do you want here?
- You.

768
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:38,396
Why, you must be mad.
Why haven't you left yet?

769
01:02:38,571 --> 01:02:42,769
- ut I...
- I told you. I told you I'm not for you.

770
01:02:42,942 --> 01:02:44,910
efore I go, I want to tell you this.

771
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:48,205
Whatever you've been,
whatever you are, whatever you will be...

772
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:51,407
- ...we belong to each other.
- Alexis, it can't be.

773
01:02:51,584 --> 01:02:56,385
l am what I am. You don't know me.
Go away and forget me.

774
01:02:56,556 --> 01:02:59,684
Forget you? How can l?

775
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:03,625
- Could you? Could you forget us?
- Women like me are trained to forget.

776
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:05,491
We mustn't admit a heart.

777
01:03:05,665 --> 01:03:08,190
- You are lying. You know you are lying.
- I am not.

778
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,198
- You are.
- No!

779
01:03:15,908 --> 01:03:19,241
You're crying, Mata. You do love me.

780
01:03:19,412 --> 01:03:21,004
Don't you?

781
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:23,148
Don't you?

782
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:28,712
- Alexis, you must leave.
- I won't. I won't until you come.

783
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,651
- It's your duty to go.
- No.

784
01:03:30,823 --> 01:03:34,452
Alexis, please go now.

785
01:03:34,627 --> 01:03:39,655
When it's all over, if you still want me,
I'll come to you no matter where you are.

786
01:03:39,832 --> 01:03:42,767
I'll come to you, I swear it.

787
01:03:42,935 --> 01:03:45,460
ut go now.

788
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:45,497
General Shubin? General Shubin?

789
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,466
General Shubin, Dubois speaking.

790
01:04:59,078 --> 01:05:02,536
Something strange about this.
You got something to open this door?

791
01:05:02,715 --> 01:05:04,307
- I'll get something.
- Yeah.

792
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:07,008
- Will this do?
- Yes, fine.

793
01:05:22,768 --> 01:05:24,861
- That's hardly a surprise.
- Suicide.

794
01:05:25,037 --> 01:05:27,505
- Suicide.
- He's only been dead a few minutes.

795
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:31,541
Probably long enough for Madame Mata Hari
to destroy all the proof he told us about.

796
01:05:31,711 --> 01:05:33,076
- Who are you?
- Russian embassy.

797
01:05:33,245 --> 01:05:37,648
Shubin was talking to His Excellency.
There was a woman's scream and a shot.

798
01:05:37,817 --> 01:05:40,047
- See if she's overlooked anything.
- Is he dead?

799
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:43,154
- Yes. A woman's voice, huh?
- Screaming.

800
01:05:43,322 --> 01:05:45,654
And the word of a dead man.

801
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:47,691
Come on.

802
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,325
All the papers are saying it's a suicide.

803
01:06:20,493 --> 01:06:23,394
If everyone's convinced,
what's the use of my hiding like this?

804
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,894
Dubois may be doing that
merely to trap you.

805
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:30,559
- It's unfortunate you found it necessary to...
- I'm the best judge of that.

806
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,569
- Have you still got you Dutch passport?
- Yes.

807
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,833
It doesn't suit my plans
to have you arrested.

808
01:06:37,009 --> 01:06:38,909
You're sailing tonight for Amsterdam.

809
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:43,879
I'll go anyplace gladly
after three days of this. It's too ridiculous.

810
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:47,986
And furthermore, your usefulness in Paris
is permanently over.

811
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:53,556
Here is the list of the Allied agents
in elgium.

812
01:06:53,726 --> 01:06:56,217
Commit those names to memory
and then destroy it.

813
01:06:56,395 --> 01:07:00,422
And report to H-12 immediately
you arrive in Amsterdam.

814
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:08,102
- Come in.
- Well, what is it?

815
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,765
- Madame sent for me.
- Yes.

816
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:13,002
l want him to get a letter through.

817
01:07:14,714 --> 01:07:19,174
- For Lieutenant Rosanoff.
- Rosanoff? ut he is...

818
01:07:19,351 --> 01:07:22,684
- What is it? What were you going to say?
- Well, I...

819
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:25,449
Get out. Get out!

820
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,729
Something's happened to him.
Tell me what it is.

821
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,391
He's dead.

822
01:07:41,874 --> 01:07:43,068
Dead?

823
01:07:44,276 --> 01:07:46,744
- How?
- Plane crash.

824
01:07:46,912 --> 01:07:49,710
Just this side of the enemy line.

825
01:07:53,419 --> 01:07:56,616
It's too late to do anything for him now.
No sense in your risking...

826
01:07:56,789 --> 01:08:00,190
- Don't talk to me.
- Well, maybe I'm wrong, of course.

827
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:04,659
Maybe he's only injured.
Yes, that's it, I think.

828
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,799
Well, can't you remember?
You must remember.

829
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:10,834
Why is it so important to you?
Where are you going?

830
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,904
- I'm going to find out.
- Wait a minute. Don't lose your head.

831
01:08:14,073 --> 01:08:16,633
After all, he's not dead, he's only injured.

832
01:08:16,809 --> 01:08:20,040
- And where is he?
- I don't know, some hospital, I suppose.

833
01:08:20,212 --> 01:08:22,112
- Well, I'll find out.
- And be arrested?

834
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:25,409
The police are probably looking
for you now.

835
01:08:30,556 --> 01:08:34,686
- Remember, you have your orders.
- What do I care for your orders?

836
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,556
You can't frighten me. I'm not Carlotta.

837
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:41,795
I'm Mata Hari and my own master.

838
01:08:41,967 --> 01:08:44,492
Here are your orders. I resign.

839
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:48,071
- Not so loud, someone will hear you.
- Oh, so you resign?

840
01:08:48,774 --> 01:08:52,107
Very well, Mata Hari,
l accept your resignation.

841
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,340
- You'll let her resign?
- My dear Durand, you ought to know.

842
01:08:57,516 --> 01:09:00,485
The only way to resign from our profession
is to die.

843
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:15,660
- Wait here.
- Yes, ma'am.

844
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:18,804
Flowers, madame. Flowers. Nice flowers.

845
01:09:18,971 --> 01:09:21,997
- How much?
- Two francs.

846
01:09:24,443 --> 01:09:25,910
Thank you.

847
01:09:45,631 --> 01:09:48,828
- Room 1, that corridor.
- Thank you.

848
01:10:11,423 --> 01:10:13,789
Could you tell me...?

849
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:18,085
Could you tell me where Room 1 is?

850
01:10:19,064 --> 01:10:23,023
I'm afraid you'll have
to ask someone else.

851
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:27,927
Sister Teresa, some water, please.

852
01:11:47,419 --> 01:11:51,355
Here. Here it is.

853
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:02,924
Mata.

854
01:12:04,937 --> 01:12:09,271
It's all my fault, Alexis.
If I hadn't kept you...

855
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:12,171
If l'd let you go sooner,
this wouldn't have happened.

856
01:12:12,344 --> 01:12:17,372
It would have happened just the same.
Really, Mata, you mustn't blame yourself.

857
01:12:17,549 --> 01:12:20,074
I'll spend my life trying
to make it up to you.

858
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,379
Oh, but I'm going to be all...

859
01:12:22,554 --> 01:12:26,684
- I'll be out of here any day now.
- On that day, we'll be married.

860
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:28,656
ut, Mata...

861
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:34,129
You asked me, didn't you?
There is so much ahead of us.

862
01:12:34,299 --> 01:12:36,893
Everything. ut I must tell you something.

863
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:39,765
And as soon as the war is over,
we'll go away...

864
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,873
...to all the places
that were made for lovers.

865
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:48,480
- And, oh, the things we'll see together.
- Don't, please.

866
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:52,777
- What?
- I don't want to frighten you, but...

867
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:54,976
What is it?

868
01:12:55,154 --> 01:12:58,180
It would be glorious to go with you...

869
01:12:58,357 --> 01:13:02,953
...but I may never be able
to see all those splendid things.

870
01:13:04,163 --> 01:13:07,792
Is it your eyes?

871
01:13:15,107 --> 01:13:19,134
Here are your eyes.
What's wrong with them?

872
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:22,838
With those "ridiculously long lashes,"
as you said.

873
01:13:24,716 --> 01:13:29,653
Now, please, it isn't worth crying about.

874
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:34,020
I'm happier this moment
than I've ever been in all my life.

875
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:38,691
What do the doctors say?

876
01:13:39,598 --> 01:13:44,058
They aren't very optimistic.
ut you know what doctors are.

877
01:13:44,236 --> 01:13:46,329
- They don't know anything.
- No.

878
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:49,997
I'll get you great specialists.
They'll make you see.

879
01:13:50,642 --> 01:13:54,874
We'll travel all over the world
till we find the right man.

880
01:13:55,047 --> 01:13:57,572
I'll never leave you again.

881
01:14:26,245 --> 01:14:31,080
Gentlemen, I appeal to you.
That man, he's been molesting me.

882
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,810
What? I'll handle this.

883
01:14:33,986 --> 01:14:35,954
l haven't done anything.

884
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:39,282
- ack to Paris. Quick.
- Yes, miss.

885
01:14:40,492 --> 01:14:43,518
Madame, I have a warrant for your arrest.

886
01:14:47,933 --> 01:14:51,733
e careful you don't have
to apologize again, Dubois.

887
01:14:53,272 --> 01:14:54,762
Now, Monsieur Dubois...

888
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,738
...you say that General Shubin
admitted over the telephone...

889
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,037
- ...that Mata Hari was an enemy spy?
- Yes.

890
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,915
- He had indisputable proof she was a spy?
- Yes.

891
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:07,449
General Shubin told you, also,
that she was there with him...

892
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:09,746
- ...while he was talking with you?
- Yes.

893
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:13,949
And you went there immediately, and you
found that Shubin had been murdered?

894
01:15:14,126 --> 01:15:17,323
- Yes.
- That's all. Thank you.

895
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:20,158
Does the defense wish to question
the witness?

896
01:15:20,332 --> 01:15:24,428
No, I don't care to prolong this farce.

897
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:28,539
You've not brought to that stand one
human being who has said that this is so.

898
01:15:28,707 --> 01:15:32,837
- "l know it. I saw it. I swear it".
- The counsel for the defense...

899
01:15:33,011 --> 01:15:35,536
...evidently has as poor a memory
as his client.

900
01:15:35,714 --> 01:15:37,944
Didn't General Shubin say
that Mata Hari...

901
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,584
...was in his rooms
at the time he was telephoning?

902
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:42,151
Oh, no.

903
01:15:42,321 --> 01:15:48,521
Dubois said that Shubin said
that she was there.

904
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:52,194
We cannot blame Monsieur Dubois,
of course...

905
01:15:52,364 --> 01:15:55,424
...for accepting too readily
whatever information was given to him.

906
01:15:56,401 --> 01:16:01,862
ut has he any proof that it was Shubin
who spoke over the telephone?

907
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,498
No. And now I want that.

908
01:16:05,677 --> 01:16:09,545
l demand that the prosecution produce
some one witness...

909
01:16:09,715 --> 01:16:12,445
...who will swear to one definite thing...

910
01:16:12,618 --> 01:16:18,716
...or I demand that Mata Hari be acquitted
with the apologies of the court.

911
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:23,293
There is a man who saw Mata Hari
at General Shubin's that morning.

912
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:26,431
This man was overheard
by a nurse in the hospital...

913
01:16:26,598 --> 01:16:28,623
...discussing this fact with the prisoner.

914
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,598
Overheard. Overheard.
Something more overheard.

915
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:35,035
Why don't you bring him here
and let me question him under oath?

916
01:16:35,207 --> 01:16:39,166
l had hoped to avoid bringing to court
a brave young officer...

917
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:42,370
...recently blinded
in the course of heroic duty.

918
01:16:42,547 --> 01:16:46,813
ut if the defense demands it,
summon Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff.

919
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:49,249
No, no, no. He knows nothing of this.

920
01:16:49,421 --> 01:16:53,187
All he can say is what I said to him
as I came out of that room.

921
01:16:53,392 --> 01:16:56,725
When you came out of what room,
Mata Hari? What room?

922
01:16:56,895 --> 01:16:59,420
I'll tell you. Shubin's room!

923
01:16:59,598 --> 01:17:03,227
Your witnesses were perjured.
You have no alibi.

924
01:17:03,402 --> 01:17:06,633
When Shubin called you a spy
over the telephone, he told the truth.

925
01:17:06,805 --> 01:17:10,332
And you knew it, and you shot him
in an attempt to save yourself.

926
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:16,914
ut it has not saved you, Mata Hari.
You stand proven an enemy of France.

927
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:26,017
Sister Teresa,
will you read this to me once more?

928
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,788
For the last time.

929
01:17:30,162 --> 01:17:33,393
- For the last time?
- Yes.

930
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:42,370
"Dearest, I shall not be able to see you
or even to write to you...

931
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,805
...for some time to come.

932
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:51,472
A sudden attack, nothing really serious,
has caused my removal to a sanitarium.

933
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:54,177
You must not be alarmed...

934
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:59,518
...because the only pain I feel
is that of being without you".

935
01:18:02,794 --> 01:18:08,733
"And when it becomes too sharp, I think
of all the happiness we have had together...

936
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:11,334
...and that which we are going to have.

937
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,670
Then I can bear anything.

938
01:18:15,474 --> 01:18:21,037
Good night, Alexis.
Tomorrow is sure to be glorious.

939
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,745
It brings me closer to you.

940
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:27,612
Mata".

941
01:18:29,087 --> 01:18:34,582
ln the name of the French Republic,
this court finds the accused, Mata Hari...

942
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:39,697
...guilty of espionage and of communicating
military information to the enemy.

943
01:18:39,865 --> 01:18:45,167
Therefore, this said court, by virtue of
articles 205, 6 and 7 of the military code...

944
01:18:45,337 --> 01:18:49,967
...condemns this woman to be shot to death
by rifle fire.

945
01:19:05,924 --> 01:19:07,755
On display!

946
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,293
Left.

947
01:19:22,808 --> 01:19:26,904
- Any news about the reprieve?
- We are expecting her lawyer any minute.

948
01:19:27,078 --> 01:19:29,569
Oh, it's getting close to 5:00.

949
01:19:29,748 --> 01:19:31,272
Here.

950
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:36,918
Give her that. Cognac.
That'll put heart into you.

951
01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:39,522
- You're a good man.
- Good?

952
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:43,183
ecause I give a dying woman a drink?

953
01:19:44,095 --> 01:19:47,724
You don't want jewelry
and you can't use clothes.

954
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:50,595
- What can I give you?
- There's nothing.

955
01:19:50,769 --> 01:19:53,431
We have everything we need.

956
01:19:53,605 --> 01:19:56,130
Everything you need?

957
01:19:56,308 --> 01:20:01,644
- How is that possible?
- We serve God and are content.

958
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:09,646
l wonder if I could be like that if I had
to do it all over again from the beginning.

959
01:20:13,024 --> 01:20:14,514
No.

960
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:19,352
That's how I am,
and that's how I had to be.

961
01:20:23,034 --> 01:20:28,199
No, little Sister,
mustn't waste your tears on me.

962
01:20:28,373 --> 01:20:30,568
Madame, Maître Caron.

963
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:34,178
Oh, he's come to bring the reprieve.

964
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,677
My dear, dear child.

965
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:49,785
- No?
- I tried everything.

966
01:20:49,961 --> 01:20:53,089
l appealed to the highest quarters.

967
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,326
l know you did.

968
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,465
Come and sit down.

969
01:21:06,244 --> 01:21:11,113
l spent a whole hour with the president,
who is one of my oldest friends, but...

970
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:13,148
What about Alexis?

971
01:21:13,318 --> 01:21:18,085
That's all settled, just as you wanted it.
He's downstairs now.

972
01:21:18,256 --> 01:21:20,884
- I'll...
- Wait.

973
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,991
Will you give him this...

974
01:21:31,169 --> 01:21:32,796
...afterwards?

975
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:37,806
- And be very gentle with him.
- Of course, my child.

976
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:43,807
l hope I have written the things
that'll help him most.

977
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:47,645
And if I haven't,
perhaps you will know what to say.

978
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:49,810
I'll know what to say.

979
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:52,923
That in having your love
even for a little while...

980
01:21:53,091 --> 01:21:56,424
...he had more than most men ever have.

981
01:21:56,895 --> 01:21:58,487
No.

982
01:21:59,464 --> 01:22:03,901
Just tell him that no matter what
he hears about me...

983
01:22:04,069 --> 01:22:06,435
...and he will hear things...

984
01:22:07,305 --> 01:22:11,969
...that my love for him was honest.

985
01:22:13,478 --> 01:22:15,844
That's all.

986
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,380
Except that he must be happy.

987
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:22,987
Must laugh and love.

988
01:22:23,822 --> 01:22:26,655
And then, someday,
when he's an old man...

989
01:22:26,825 --> 01:22:30,158
...and his grandchildren ask him
about Mata Hari...

990
01:22:30,762 --> 01:22:35,995
...he must tell a great lie, say that she
was a wonderfully good woman.

991
01:22:36,735 --> 01:22:39,397
And that'll be my heaven.

992
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,906
- Now will you ask him to come up?
- At once.

993
01:22:46,745 --> 01:22:49,179
Sister, the young man is blind.

994
01:22:49,347 --> 01:22:52,510
l've told him that this is a sanitarium.
You must be careful.

995
01:22:52,684 --> 01:22:55,517
They will. They understand.

996
01:23:02,661 --> 01:23:04,492
Come.

997
01:23:04,963 --> 01:23:07,431
Take care of the steps.

998
01:23:12,804 --> 01:23:19,300
Madame, I'm leaving the door open so that
the visitor won't hear the rattle of the lock.

999
01:23:19,477 --> 01:23:21,741
less you.

1000
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:28,650
Alexis.

1001
01:23:44,035 --> 01:23:46,833
Come, nurses. We'll look
at the patient in the next room...

1002
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:51,635
- ...and leave these young people alone.
- Thank you, doctor.

1003
01:23:59,517 --> 01:24:01,246
This is most irregular.

1004
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:07,283
And after the operation, how much longer
will you have to stay here?

1005
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,484
I don't know.

1006
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:12,824
- I'll be well soon, I hope.
- Of course you will.

1007
01:24:12,997 --> 01:24:15,090
- And so will I.
- What?

1008
01:24:15,266 --> 01:24:18,099
The doctors say now that with time
and the right treatment...

1009
01:24:18,269 --> 01:24:22,899
...there is every chance I'll see again.
See you again.

1010
01:24:25,043 --> 01:24:28,774
That's the one thing I needed
to give me strength.

1011
01:24:30,248 --> 01:24:35,379
Mata, you are telling me the truth?
It isn't a dangerous operation?

1012
01:24:35,553 --> 01:24:39,683
No. No, it's very slight, really.

1013
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:45,020
And in a short time, we'll forget all this
and be so happy.

1014
01:24:45,196 --> 01:24:48,825
Just the same, I can't bear
to think of you suffering.

1015
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:52,325
- Alexis?
- Yes.

1016
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:56,462
- Promise me you won't worry about me.
- Oh, Mata, please.

1017
01:24:56,641 --> 01:24:58,472
Now, promise me.

1018
01:24:58,643 --> 01:25:03,580
You know what operations are.
Even the slightest, there's always a chance.

1019
01:25:03,748 --> 01:25:07,741
Promise me.
If something should happen to me...

1020
01:25:07,919 --> 01:25:11,047
...you won't grieve too much,
that you'll carry on.

1021
01:25:11,222 --> 01:25:14,658
ut nothing will happen to you.
You mustn't be afraid.

1022
01:25:16,427 --> 01:25:18,725
Well, then hold me.

1023
01:25:20,265 --> 01:25:23,632
l won't be afraid if you hold me.

1024
01:25:43,087 --> 01:25:44,952
Is it time?

1025
01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:51,123
The doctor and the nurses,
they've come to take me.

1026
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,589
Already? Why need it be so early?

1027
01:25:54,766 --> 01:25:57,394
Well, they always operate
early in the morning.

1028
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:00,868
And the sooner I go, the sooner it's over.

1029
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:07,002
All right, but you mustn't be frightened.
I'll wait right here till they bring you back.

1030
01:26:07,178 --> 01:26:11,638
No, no. I don't want you to.
Monsieur Caron is waiting to take you back.

1031
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:15,052
He'll let you know just how I am.

1032
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:18,747
- Very soon.
- You are afraid.

1033
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:23,189
- No.
- You needn't be. I've been through it.

1034
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:27,229
The anesthetic is unpleasant,
but that's all.

1035
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:43,946
- Goodbye, my beloved.
- Oh, you sound so tragic.

1036
01:26:46,217 --> 01:26:50,620
- Goodbye, my beloved. Is that better?
- Yes, darling.

1037
01:27:03,234 --> 01:27:06,931
Courage. Courage, my dear. e brave.

1038
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:19,874
Goodbye.

1039
01:27:20,885 --> 01:27:22,876
Goodbye.

1040
01:27:44,442 --> 01:27:47,900
God, save her. Protect her.

1041
01:27:48,813 --> 01:27:51,941
And if you must take her, take me too.

1042
01:27:52,305 --> 01:27:58,679
