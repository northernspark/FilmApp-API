Hurry up. Come on.

23
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:56,318
Mmm.

24
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:01,092
- Morning, Miss Mildred.
- Girl, you got my money?

25
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,459
I get paid today. I'll have it
for you when I pick her up.

26
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,122
Bye, baby.
Mommy loves you.

27
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:07,962
- All right.
- Here you go.

28
00:02:08,034 --> 00:02:09,831
Don't you see me
trying to get to work?

29
00:02:09,903 --> 00:02:11,734
Harry, these ain't
nothing but bills.

30
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:13,739
Just put 'em
in the box next time.

31
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:16,469
Come on,
come on, come on.

32
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:18,033
All right.
Have a good one.

33
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:20,477
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Mama.

34
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:25,948
Cheryl, please don't do this to me.
Please don't do this. Please.

35
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,510
Henry, you know we ride
this bus every day.

36
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:30,055
- She is coming!
- Tell her come on.

37
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:32,091
Tell her come on.
Tell her come on!

38
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:37,957
You know what?
I'm moving the bus.

39
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:41,159
- And I'll sue you and this bus company.
- Calm down.

40
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:43,361
- You ain't suing nobody.
- You're not going anywhere!

41
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:45,404
- Your donuts can wait!
- Don't you worry about my donuts.

42
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:47,201
I'ma drive off.
Get out of the door.

43
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:49,969
- She can't be late for work.
- We all gonna be late for work.

44
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:51,908
And you shut up!
I don't know you.

45
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:54,412
Cheryl, will you stop talking
to the patrons like that?

46
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,180
Get out of the door.

47
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:02,278
Don't you be cussing at me.

48
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:05,324
Tell her to come on.
I'ma lose my job!

49
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,528
- She's coming!
- Tell her come on.

50
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:20,238
Oh! Thanks, Henry.
You're the best.

51
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,103
You have something to say?

52
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:26,078
Mm-hmm.
That's what I thought.

53
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:29,582
Oh. Oh, God.

54
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:43,551
Sorry. The kids were
running... running late.

55
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,996
I was not gonna
let him leave without you.

56
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:50,593
Good looking out. You know
I can't afford to get docked.

57
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,138
- What's all that?
- Bills.

58
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:56,698
Brenda, has Michael given you
any money for your son?

59
00:03:56,776 --> 00:04:00,507
Don't ask. Oh, speaking of...
can you loan me $100?

60
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,878
I've got to give
Miss Mildred something.

61
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,849
She won't keep Lena
for me next week.

62
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:06,249
Come on. I know.

63
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,517
Okay, let me look at my bills
and I'll let you know.

64
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,321
- Thank you.
- I may be able to give you a joint loan.

65
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:18,194
- What is a joint loan?
- A loan from my joint money.

66
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:21,358
Girl. You know what?
You insane.

67
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,994
You know you ain't supposed
to be smoking that stuff

68
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,436
- with your condition.
- Whatever.

69
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:31,099
- What's that?
- It says my daddy died.

70
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:35,409
No. Your daddy died?

71
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:38,650
It says the funeral
is on Saturday.

72
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,750
Ay, Brenda, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:43,789
- I never met the man.
- Ah.

74
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:46,189
And what is this here?

75
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,160
Three bus tickets to Georgia.

76
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,995
- Are you going?
- I don't know these people.

77
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:56,194
They know you. How else would they
know where to send the tickets?

78
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,669
Yeah, but there's four of us, huh?

79
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,638
But that's a good question.

80
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:03,935
And read this...

81
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,240
there is a will.

82
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:09,008
Oh my God, what if
he was superrich

83
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:11,846
and left you millions
and millions of dollars?

84
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,752
Right. I doubt that.
We never talked about him.

85
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:18,313
You know, since she used
to do anything for money,

86
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:21,758
if he was, believe me,
she'd have still been with him.

87
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:25,025
I think you should go.
You never know, mami.

88
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:27,396
- You never know.
- Girl.

89
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,697
I ain't going to no Georgia.

90
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:34,099
What the hell?

91
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:37,003
What's going on?

92
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,807
Excuse us.
Excuse us.

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,314
- Coming through.
- Excuse me.

94
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:45,783
Excuse me, ma'am.
What's going on, girl?

95
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:47,183
- Look.
- What happened?

96
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:48,982
They shut the place down, Cheryl.

97
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,613
They said they moved
the plant to Mexico.

98
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,749
- Hurry!
- And they didn't tell us!

99
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:54,918
- Move move!
- Go go! Come on!

100
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:57,929
Wait! We were supposed
to get paid today!

101
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,158
- I've got to pay my light bill today.
- Who has a match?!

102
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:07,070
I'm going to burn this place down!
Who has a match?!

103
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,335
Don't give this fool
no match. She bipolar.

104
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:12,242
No, seriously. She gotta take
medication just to stay right.

105
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:15,372
I know one of you have a match!
You smoke, Georgia!

106
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:17,416
Give me a match.
Give it to me.

107
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:27,054
Cheryl, put that out.

108
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:30,494
Come on, I'm trying
to chill out.

109
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:32,656
You know with your
chemical imbalance

110
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,427
you're not supposed
to do drugs.

111
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,764
- Did you take your medicine?
- I was trying to,

112
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:39,134
but then you started talking
about "put that out."

113
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:42,106
All right. I'm just
looking out for you.

114
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,077
I'm fine. I just can't believe they
would do something like that.

115
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:49,740
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh, hi, Miss Mildred.

116
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:52,808
- How you doing?
- Hi, Mildred.

117
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:56,252
Miss Mildred to you.

118
00:06:56,322 --> 00:07:00,884
- Girl, you got my money?
- We lost our job today, Miss Mildred.

119
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,053
Now I'm running a daycare,
not a welfare.

120
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,189
You're running an illegal daycare,
so relax.

121
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:09,257
Little girl, you don't know nothing
about my business.

122
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:13,904
This is the last day.

123
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:16,965
I'm not keeping your daughter
another minute.

124
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,568
I'll come get her.

125
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,636
She's taking a nap now.

126
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:24,615
That's the trouble
with you young mothers...

127
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,447
only think about yourselves.

128
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,510
You just said
come get her.

129
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:32,354
And I meant it...
after she wakes up and eats.

130
00:07:34,193 --> 00:07:36,684
- Okay.
- The child is sleeping.

131
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,122
Thank you,
Miss Mildred!

132
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,293
- She's crazy.
- Naw, she's all right.

133
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:46,497
Shoot. I don't know what
I'm gonna do now though.

134
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,405
- She don't play with her money.
- Yeah, me neither.

135
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,943
If I had known they were going
to close down the plant,

136
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:55,447
I would have beat
my supervisors up yesterday.

137
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,242
Well, what you gonna do?

138
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:01,980
Shoot, I'm barely
getting by as it was.

139
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:04,250
What you have to do is

140
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,689
go and file child support
on that Michael.

141
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,387
- Hm-mmm.
- You know that Jenny got

142
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:11,623
$8,000 in back child support.

143
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:14,359
They'll get it for you
and they'll kick his ass.

144
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:18,097
8,000? Shoot.

145
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,833
No, he'd kill me.

146
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:24,365
Mamacita,
you go talk to him.

147
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:28,175
Let me know if you need me
and my nine to pay him a little visit.

148
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:31,582
All right.

149
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:36,221
# Troubled little angel #

150
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,022
# Inconsistent, flying blind
most of the time #

151
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:45,724
# Drama queen... #

152
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,827
# Preening and untangling #

153
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,838
# Feathers in her wings #

154
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:56,431
# Captured by her dreams... #

155
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,808
- Good morning, Mama.
- Hey, sweetheart.

156
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:05,850
# Needy little baby... #

157
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,115
# Open up your heart... #

158
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,186
Are you crying, Mama?

159
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,887
No no, I'm fine.

160
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:17,827
We're gonna be
all right, Ma.

161
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:21,162
We've been here before,
and don't we always make it?

162
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:24,464
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:28,006
Let me cook this for you.

164
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,668
Relax.

165
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:40,382
Uh-oh.
Here you go, Mama.

166
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:43,513
It's one of them
old songs. Come on.

167
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,352
- Dance with me.
- Michael. Michael.

168
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:47,415
- No, baby.
- It's your song. You'll feel better.

169
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:49,791
- Come on, dance with me.
- Michael.

170
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51,830
Come on.

171
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,663
Do I have to listen to this?

172
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,635
Yes, and you're
gonna like it.

173
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:02,441
# You make me happy... #

174
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:04,499
All we got to eat
is oatmeal?

175
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:07,410
Yes, and you're gonna
like that too.

176
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,914
Baby, this is for you.
You eat that, all right?

177
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:11,916
Mama, huh-uh.

178
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:14,350
I got honeys at school
that'll give me breakfast.

179
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,718
Michael, I want you to eat this.

180
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,919
Come on now. What would
I do without you, hmm?

181
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,004
Hey hey, man, come on.

182
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:44,709
- Please, don't do that.
- I'm sorry.

183
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:46,718
Come on, have a heart...
for my baby.

184
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:49,084
- Lady, I'm doing what they tell me.
- I called!

185
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:52,784
- I told them I needed a couple days!
- I'm sorry.

186
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:54,826
Come on, man.

187
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:06,364
Come on.

188
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:12,937
Go up, go up!

189
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:20,248
- Yes!
- There you go!

190
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:28,625
- Defense! Defense!
- Right here!

191
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:32,323
Defense! Defense!

192
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,605
Time out! Time out!

193
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,231
Time out.

194
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:47,309
Come on!

195
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:00,588
Go go go!

196
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:09,826
You the man!

197
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:11,995
Get up!

198
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:14,773
Whoo!

199
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:21,339
That's what
I'm talking about.

200
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:22,813
What'd I say?
What'd I say?

201
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,651
Good job, my Mikey.

202
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:32,521
- Goodbye, everybody. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

203
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:36,889
Ma, you see me score?

204
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:38,862
Whoo! I saw ya!

205
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:41,764
Saw those shoes too.

206
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:45,499
Now don't worry
about that, Ma.

207
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:49,007
I told the guys on the team
that they're my lucky shoes.

208
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:52,533
I didn't know you
were coming.

209
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:55,136
- Thought you had to work.
- Yeah, I did too.

210
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:57,182
- I lost my job.
- What?

211
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,649
- Oh my gosh!
- We're gonna be all right.

212
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:03,678
- Don't worry.
- My teacher can help me get a job.

213
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:07,123
- No. Hm-mmm.
- But, Mama, you've gotta let me help.

214
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:09,753
No, you're staying
in school, all right?

215
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:11,524
But I can work
and go to school, Ma.

216
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:14,430
Listen, baby, I thought
the same thing. Huh?

217
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,024
I end up having
to drop out of school,

218
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:18,195
working a bunch of dead-end jobs
just to make ends meet.

219
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,204
I don't want you working.

220
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:23,708
Now you just... you just
concentrate on them books

221
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:25,505
and... and playing ball.

222
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,239
I'm gonna make it work.

223
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:29,247
Are you sure?

224
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:30,612
Hey.

225
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:32,583
One thing a black woman
know how to do...

226
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:35,051
that's make it. Hmm?

227
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,360
- Yo, what's up, Mike?
- Hey, what's up, Cal?

228
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,794
Chilling.
Good game tonight though.

229
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,764
Thanks. Nice whip, man.

230
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:48,823
I appreciate it, man.
I just bought this.

231
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:51,563
It's my baby.
How you doing, Miss Brown?

232
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:54,834
- Hey.
- Hey, we're going to kick it tonight,

233
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:57,341
celebrate a little bit.
You want to roll with us?

234
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,840
No, man. I've gotta walk
my mom and my sisters home.

235
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,046
I can give y'all a ride.
You want a ride?

236
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:07,585
- No.
- Okay.

237
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:09,848
- Hey, Cal.
- Yes, ma'am?

238
00:14:09,922 --> 00:14:13,653
- Who's car is that?
- It's mine. I just bought this.

239
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:15,921
Calvin, where you working?

240
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:18,463
Hmm? Huh?

241
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:21,762
You know your mama'd turn over
in her grave if she knew, don't you?

242
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:24,029
All right all right,
I'll holler, man.

243
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:26,628
- All right, man. You be easy.
- Come on, Ma.

244
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,696
Bye, Miss Brown.

245
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:32,210
I don't want you hanging with them boys.
I don't even want you talking to 'em.

246
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,770
But, Ma, you know me and Calvin
been hanging since the third grade.

247
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:37,247
Yeah, well, he done changed.

248
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:39,216
and I don't want you
with him, all right?

249
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,753
- But, Ma, Calvin's cool.
- Look, do you think I'm crazy?

250
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:44,915
- Huh? Do you?
- No.

251
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,821
Now I know them boys
is in the dope game.

252
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:49,486
I don't want you with them.
Do you hear me?

253
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:52,087
- Do you?
- Yes, ma'am.

254
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:54,359
All right.

255
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:58,268
Come on, y'all.
Come on.

256
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:14,944
- Hey. Mike?
- Yeah.

257
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,979
I'm Harry Belton. Your coach wanted me
to fly up here and see you play.

258
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:22,516
You're pretty good.
You've got a lot of potential.

259
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:25,189
Potential?
That's what you call it?

260
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:27,357
Who is this?
Who are you?

261
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:30,334
I'm Harry. Mike's coach wanted me
to see your brother play.

262
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:33,098
We run a camp in the summer
for high-school players.

263
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:36,039
Are your parents around? I'd like
to talk to them about Mike attending.

264
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:38,838
- I'm his mama.
- Nice try though.

265
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:41,675
Oh. Uh, Mrs. Brown...

266
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:44,045
- Miss.
- Miss Brown,

267
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,949
can I take you to lunch

268
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,010
so we can talk about Mike?

269
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:51,989
What? No. Look, mister,
I don't know where you're from,

270
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:53,957
but what his coach
should've told you

271
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,995
is that I don't want Mike to even
think about basketball until after

272
00:15:57,062 --> 00:16:00,225
he gets into college, which, judging by
his grades, might not even happen.

273
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:03,462
I agree. Grades are important,
especially the way Mike plays.

274
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,834
Whoa whoa, what's that
supposed to mean?

275
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,964
It means you're talented,
but talent's not enough.

276
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,871
You need the right attitude
plus skill.

277
00:16:09,942 --> 00:16:11,705
Look, man.
Hold on, I got skills.

278
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:14,405
Watch your mouth.
You know what?

279
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,345
The reason that coach sent
you over here by yourself

280
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,110
is 'cause he knows
he don't do nothing

281
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:21,050
but tell these boys in this neighborhood
that they can make it to the pros.

282
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,883
And when they end up
with their hearts broken

283
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:24,445
they walk around here
mad at the world.

284
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,718
That ain't happening
to my son, okay?

285
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,054
So you're gonna
have to excuse me.

286
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:30,095
I've got too much on my mind
to deal with this.

287
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:32,426
Come on, Michael.
Come on.

288
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:36,894
Potential? Huh.

289
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:49,878
Girl, you got my money?

290
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:53,248
No, but I was just wondering
if you could keep her

291
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,583
for just a few hours
while I try and go get it?

292
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:57,417
Girl, do you think
I'm crazy?

293
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,458
Now you got to pay your money
like all the other mothers in here.

294
00:17:01,493 --> 00:17:04,189
Okay. Thank you.

295
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:07,232
- Come on.
- Come on in here.

296
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:14,537
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am.

297
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,167
Yes, you are. Quit lying.

298
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:19,005
When you bring that baby,

299
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:21,842
oh, she be starving,
so I know you must be too.

300
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:23,973
Here, eat that.

301
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:32,089
I don't know what's the matter
with you young girls

302
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,717
having all these babies
you know you can't take care of.

303
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:38,229
Look, I don't need no lecture from you.
I know what I've done.

304
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:40,663
They're here now,
they're my responsibility.

305
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:43,793
You know what?
Lena, come on. Let's go.

306
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,962
Oh, sit down, girly.
I'm just talking to you.

307
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:55,777
Eat and settle down.

308
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,645
Eat.

309
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,010
- You're a good mother.
- Huh!

310
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:05,682
I've got enough bad ones running
through here to know that.

311
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:08,784
Now what is
going on with you?

312
00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:15,399
I don't know.

313
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:22,901
Somehow I always managed
to make it through,

314
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:26,308
but now it's just
getting harder and harder.

315
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:29,677
It ain't somehow,
it's the Lord.

316
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:32,546
And all that means is you're getting
close to a breakthrough.

317
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:35,178
Till then you just keep praying.

318
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:37,449
I pray.

319
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:39,889
I try to pray

320
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,550
and I try to live right,

321
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:44,391
but where's it getting me?
Look at me.

322
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:47,626
If you had seen the look
on my babies' faces

323
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,793
when that man turned
my lights off...

324
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:51,631
Now you listen to me.

325
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:54,832
Don't you ever get tired
of doing the right thing,

326
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:58,104
'cause in the end,
that's what pays off.

327
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:00,873
You're the best mother
I have seen,

328
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:03,312
that's why I'm gonna
keep that baby.

329
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,408
Oh.

330
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,851
I wouldn't do that
for these other ones here.

331
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,082
At least they can afford
to pay you, Miss Mildred.

332
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:13,522
Huh! Honey, I don't
want to know half

333
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:16,390
of what they're doing
to get that money.

334
00:19:19,398 --> 00:19:23,027
Go on now.
Take that with you.

335
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:29,668
Thank you,
just a couple of hours.

336
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:31,539
I swear.
Thank you, Miss Mildred.

337
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:46,322
All right.

338
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:49,485
Hold it. Ladies, ladies,

339
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:52,223
you can't be here.
This is a hard-hat area.

340
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:56,563
Oh. Hi, I'm looking
for Michael Rose.

341
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:59,069
- Is he here?
- Who's asking?

342
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:02,596
- Brenda.
- Well, he's busy.

343
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:05,837
Man, look here.
You'd better go find him.

344
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:08,846
I'm his baby mama,
and if I don't find him,

345
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:11,439
you are going to regret it.

346
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:24,560
- I don't see him, anyway.
- Go take care of this, all right?

347
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,063
Wait wait wait wait wait.

348
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,361
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, man.

349
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:35,768
Brenda, what are
you doing here?

350
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:39,140
I've been calling you.
You haven't returned my calls.

351
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:41,179
You know, this job
pays me $25 an hour.

352
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:42,679
I'm busy.
What do you want?

353
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:45,774
I lost my job, Michael.

354
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:47,944
- I ain't got no money.
- Michael...

355
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,386
I've been raising
your son by myself

356
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:52,582
and in 17 years I ain't never
asked you for nothing.

357
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:55,991
You know, now I just need
a little help.

358
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:58,757
- I ain't got no money.
- Well, you'd better go find some,

359
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:01,163
'cause your kids
are hungry, you fool.

360
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,565
- Who the hell is she?
- My name is Child Welfare,

361
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:05,626
and I'm gonna lock you up.

362
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:08,434
- Are you threatening me?
- Oh, yeah. What, you don't know

363
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:10,134
when someone is
threatening you, huh?

364
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:12,803
Mike... Michael, look.

365
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:15,073
They turned my lights off,
all right?

366
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:18,344
Your son, he needs some...
some clothes.

367
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,214
- I told you.
- Could you...

368
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:23,652
could you just give me
some money for food?

369
00:21:23,722 --> 00:21:25,815
I'll tell you what... y'all need
to take your asses on

370
00:21:25,891 --> 00:21:28,724
and don't you come
to my job no more.

371
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,327
Huh! Heh.

372
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:35,161
Come on.

373
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,600
- Let's go.
- Okay.

374
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:41,172
I'll be right there.

375
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:44,500
- Cheryl.
- You all right?

376
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,409
- Run. Run!
- Oh my God!

377
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:55,478
I can't go anywhere
with you, Cheryl!

378
00:21:55,554 --> 00:21:58,250
- You could've hit him in the head.
- So? He deserved it!

379
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:00,848
- You're going to jail.
- Ay, I don't care.

380
00:22:00,926 --> 00:22:03,121
I've been there, mamacita.

381
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:05,288
Ai, we need money.

382
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:07,195
You need money.
I'm gonna rob a bank.

383
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:08,858
Come on, be serious.

384
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,993
Cheryl, why are
you so crazy?

385
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:15,733
Because it's fun,
because I like it.

386
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:19,243
You know what? I've been thinking
a lot about your father.

387
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:21,836
I think you really should
go down there to Georgia.

388
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,814
- What if he left you something?
- No, Cheryl.

389
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:25,975
Come on. Why not?

390
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:30,654
Because I'm tired of getting my hopes up
for things that don't happen.

391
00:22:30,722 --> 00:22:33,350
So what? You have nothing
to lose right now.

392
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:36,725
Come on, there's the bus.

393
00:22:57,616 --> 00:22:59,140
Watch your step.

394
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:01,879
Watch your step there.

395
00:23:01,954 --> 00:23:03,717
All right,
have a good day now.

396
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:18,500
This is country.

397
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,901
You can say that again.

398
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:22,736
Looks like we gonna
see slaves at any minute.

399
00:23:22,808 --> 00:23:24,901
She look like she about
to fight somebody.

400
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:27,343
Uh, excuse me,
you must be Brenda.

401
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:32,677
I told you.
It's Chicken George.

402
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:34,844
- Yeah.
- I knowed it! I knowed...

403
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,478
I said to myself...
I said, "Self."

404
00:23:36,555 --> 00:23:38,785
Myself said, "Hmm?"
I said, "That's Brenda.

405
00:23:38,857 --> 00:23:41,451
That's got to be her." All these peoples,
I picked you out...

406
00:23:41,526 --> 00:23:45,087
looked you in the face.
Girl, I'm Leroy Brown.

407
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:47,495
- Hi.
- My friends call me Leroy Brown.

408
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:49,397
- You can just call me...
- Leroy Brown?

409
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:50,867
Yeah yeah,
how'd you know?

410
00:23:50,936 --> 00:23:54,463
- This is my daughter Cora.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

411
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,336
- This is my baby.
- Nice to meet you too.

412
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:59,172
Oh, look at you!
Hey, who are you?

413
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:01,269
Mommy, I like the clown.

414
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,314
He looks like a flag.

415
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:06,283
- Yeah.
- Leroy Brown?

416
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,444
You, um... you must be L.B.

417
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,454
Oh no, that's my brother
Larry Brown.

418
00:24:10,522 --> 00:24:12,285
They just call him...
they call him L.B.

419
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:15,326
Mm-hmm. That's my oldest brother
on my daddy's side.

420
00:24:15,394 --> 00:24:17,419
He told me to come
by here and get y'all.

421
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:19,430
Yeah. Y'all ready to go?

422
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:21,898
- Yeah, we're ready.
- Grab your stuff. Let's go.

423
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:23,958
Oh, I'm glad
y'all made it safely.

424
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:26,368
Come on. You need
some help with that?

425
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:28,531
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Here, Cora, hold that.

426
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:31,167
My back is messed up.
Y'all be careful now.

427
00:24:31,243 --> 00:24:34,644
L.B., he was gonna come to get y'all,
but he had to go somewhere.

428
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:36,476
He had to go to Bingo,
I think. You see...

429
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:38,038
Ooh, Lord.

430
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:40,277
If y'all feel some jerking,
that's my transmission.

431
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:41,842
It just "snips" sometimes.

432
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,946
I got it fixed at church
the other day. Yeah.

433
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,548
- So how was your ride?
- Oh, it was fine.

434
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:49,753
- Yes, thank you.
- When my... L.B. told me

435
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:52,422
I needed to come get you,
he said you's a friend of the family.

436
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:54,260
I said I'm gonna go get her,

437
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:56,493
'cause she's a friend of him,
he's a friend of mine.

438
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:58,695
That's all right.
So where you from?

439
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,829
- Um, Chicago.
- Chicago.

440
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:03,841
Chicago! That's where them big
buildings is, ain't it?

441
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:05,604
Yeah, they got
a lot of big buildings.

442
00:25:05,677 --> 00:25:08,669
- Ain't that where that S... Serus Tower?
- The Sears Tower.

443
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:11,511
Yeah, my daddy...
my daddy just loved it there.

444
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:15,144
He had a... he was there
and everything. I miss my daddy.

445
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,744
It's going to be
all right, Mr. Brown.

446
00:25:16,822 --> 00:25:18,517
I just can't take it.
Lord, take the wheel.

447
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,182
I want you to look
at the road, Mr. Brown!

448
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:22,089
Get the wheel!

449
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,357
- Chicago's a nice town.
- Yeah, I like it.

450
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,694
- Mm-hmm.
- See, she likes it.

451
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:30,257
- I couldn't live there.
- Would you look at the road?

452
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:33,327
Huh-uh, gimme the South.
Yes, I like the trees of the South.

453
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:36,772
I don't like it. There's too much
smog and stuff there.

454
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:38,605
- Yeah?
- My daddy liked it though.

455
00:25:38,677 --> 00:25:41,441
- It's okay, Mr. Brown.
- He was always in Chicago.

456
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:43,743
It's all right. I want you
to watch the road.

457
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,749
Oh wait, now watch the road!

458
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:48,285
He just taught me so much.

459
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:50,116
He taught me how
to dance and swim.

460
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:51,621
I miss him.

461
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:01,123
- Now this is when he was a young boy.
- Mm-hmm.

462
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,793
Oh, he was so handsome.

463
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,201
Now over here...

464
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:08,466
- this is when he married.
- That's my mama.

465
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,871
Oh, wow.

466
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:11,966
So how you know our daddy?

467
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:15,809
- Well, my mama...
- Where is everybody? Oh!

468
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:17,906
- Here we go.
- Y'all Daddy go.

469
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:20,076
Oh, Lord, help me.
Help me.

470
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:23,315
Vera, will you get somewhere
and sit down without all that drama?

471
00:26:23,388 --> 00:26:25,481
Go on, y'all, daddy dead!

472
00:26:25,557 --> 00:26:27,548
Vera, get ahold
of yourself now.

473
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:30,686
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, I just don't know
what I'm gonna do, y'all.

474
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:32,753
I can't sleep.
I can't eat.

475
00:26:32,831 --> 00:26:35,129
- You want some cake?
- Oh, yes, cake would help.

476
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,998
That would definitely help me.
Got any rum in that?

477
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:39,468
I don't know. Here you go.

478
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:42,837
Oh Lord, who's this big
yellow woman blinding me?

479
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:46,173
Good Lord, eclipse.
Eclipse!

480
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:49,077
- This is my daughter Cora.
- Your daughter?!

481
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:53,208
Brown, I didn't know
your soldiers marched.

482
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:55,378
Yeah, you remember in school

483
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:58,286
and you had on them tight pants,
you had a pencil stuck in the pocket?

484
00:26:58,356 --> 00:27:01,154
And then he fell.

485
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:04,525
- Instant vasectomy.
- D'oh!

486
00:27:04,596 --> 00:27:07,565
That ain't funny.
I got lead poisoning...

487
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:09,190
on my privacy.

488
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:12,327
- Good one.
- You do look a little familiar.

489
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:16,773
- Who's your mama?
- Oh, um... Madea.

490
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:18,866
Madea!

491
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:26,840
- Brown, that's just nasty.
- Oh, you don't know my mother.

492
00:27:26,918 --> 00:27:29,478
You gonna roll up on me?
Hell to the no!

493
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:31,351
I got my purse.
I got something for you.

494
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:33,687
- Bring it!
- Don't go gospel gangster on her, baby.

495
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:35,123
Just relax.
That's your Aunt Vera.

496
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:36,990
What? Ain't no auntie of mine
acting like that.

497
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:39,189
- She drinks and smokes.
- Sit down.

498
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:41,255
- Sit down.
- You can't tell me to calm.

499
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,858
- Please excuse my mother.
- Oh, this is your cousin Will.

500
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:46,369
- He a doctor... a "gonorrheacologist."
- Oh!

501
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:50,367
- A gynecologist.
- Oh, okay. Nice to meet you.

502
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:52,137
Same thing.

503
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,610
Brown, I want to know
what these strangers

504
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:57,170
are doing here
during our time of bereavement.

505
00:27:57,249 --> 00:28:00,741
- Vera, don't be so mean!
- How are y'all doing? I'm Will.

506
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:03,379
- Vera's son.
- Hello.

507
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:05,446
Who are you?
Now wait... hey hey hey!

508
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:07,889
Hey, Brown,
this your daughter too?

509
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:11,929
I'm Brenda
and this is Michael,

510
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:14,056
Lena and Tosha.

511
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:16,123
Brenda came down
for the funeral.

512
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:18,863
- Where'd she come from?
- Chicago.

513
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:22,532
Daddy! Daddy!

514
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:25,872
- Okay, Ma.
- My daddy lived in Chicago long ago.

515
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:27,775
Help me, Jesus!

516
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:31,009
Come on, y'all. I'm gonna show you
where you're gonna sleep.

517
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,812
- Oh, thank you.
- Just go on up the stairs

518
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:36,410
- and turn to your left.
- See you later.

519
00:28:36,488 --> 00:28:37,978
- Good night.
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:28:38,056 --> 00:28:41,890
And, Vera, you all can sleep
in Pop Brown's old room.

521
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,158
Oh, now I ain't sleeping in some room
some dead man died in.

522
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:49,291
I've been sleeping
with a dead man for years.

523
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:06,506
- Hey!
- You following us or something?

524
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:10,250
No. It's my hometown.
I live here.

525
00:29:10,322 --> 00:29:13,189
- What are you doing here?
- Minding my business.

526
00:29:13,258 --> 00:29:16,455
Oh yes, that's Harry.

527
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:19,656
Yo, hey, Harry!

528
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:21,596
- Hey, Mr. Brown.
- You doing all right?

529
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

530
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:24,797
Sorry to hear
about your daddy.

531
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,770
Oh, it's okay. People's dying
that ain't never died before.

532
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,830
Yeah, he's in a better place now.

533
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:31,307
Mm-hmm, he gone to heaven.

534
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:33,207
What's up, Harry?
How you doing, man?

535
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:34,905
- Big Will!
- Long time no see.

536
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:37,106
- I know.
- Thanks for coming. What's going on?

537
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:38,672
Just came by to pay
my condolences.

538
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,615
Oh, you ain't got to pay
for nothing.

539
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:42,448
We got $25,
everything is covered.

540
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,353
Yeah, Daddy left a big insurance
policy for that much.

541
00:29:45,423 --> 00:29:47,414
Hey, Mike, I was watching you
from upstairs.

542
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,016
- You're pretty good.
- Oh, thanks.

543
00:29:49,094 --> 00:29:50,686
He just needs
to watch his elbow.

544
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:52,286
Who are you to be
giving me advice?

545
00:29:52,364 --> 00:29:54,594
Mike, this is Harry Belton...

546
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:57,191
high-school all-American,
college standout.

547
00:29:57,268 --> 00:29:59,668
And a pretty good professional player
until he retired.

548
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:02,571
- I ain't never heard of him.
- You ain't never heard of him?

549
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,440
Where you been? All you know is that
young boy "Lebanon" James, ain't it?

550
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:09,036
Gimme the basketball,
I'm gonna show you... whoa!

551
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:11,878
- That's nice, Uncle Brown.
- You done scratched my suit.

552
00:30:13,885 --> 00:30:16,786
Harry's a high-school coach
here now and college recruiter

553
00:30:16,855 --> 00:30:19,847
and does camps and develops
talent over the summer, right?

554
00:30:19,924 --> 00:30:22,392
- Yep.
- Oh, the coach of Hillbilly High, huh?

555
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,052
Oooh, you're so "disrespected."

556
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:26,620
And arrogant.

557
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:28,825
We've got some
talented kids like you.

558
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,733
But they listen, so that would
make 'em better than you.

559
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:34,294
Please.

560
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:36,033
Oooh, you arrogant.

561
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,474
- Still got it.
- "Squish"!

562
00:30:39,544 --> 00:30:40,977
- "Squish."
- One on one.

563
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:43,013
- Do it.
- All right.

564
00:30:43,081 --> 00:30:45,049
You got some money?

565
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,984
I don't gamble.

566
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:50,247
Me neither. I'm safe.
I'ma... I got knicks.

567
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:53,586
I'm gonna change into my good clothes.
You don't know nothing about basketball.

568
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:54,625
Check it out.
Come on.

569
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:58,652
Whoo, I'm just coming in here
to keep y'all company.

570
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,426
Don't ask me to cook nothing.
Last time I was in the kitchen

571
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:03,330
I burned myself
and cut myself.

572
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:08,305
Child, slow down.
Dinner gonna be in a while.

573
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:11,171
Vera, don't start.

574
00:31:11,242 --> 00:31:15,736
- Your mama don't feed you?
- Sometimes we don't have enough to eat.

575
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:20,251
- Really?
- Well, you just eat all you want here.

576
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:22,047
You hear?
We got plenty.

577
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,747
That's right.
Miss Sarah's a great cook.

578
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:25,687
Look like you been
eating here for years.

579
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:27,019
Oh look, you don't know me.

580
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:28,888
- You gonna make me go in my purse.
- Do it.

581
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,689
- Don't hurt me, baby.
- You want some more, baby?

582
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:34,391
I'd love to, but I gotta save
some for my sister and brother.

583
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:36,900
Well, it look like you ate it all.

584
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:39,732
Oooh, wow.

585
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:42,364
Something sure smells good.

586
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:45,805
- Uh, Mom?
- Yeah, baby?

587
00:31:45,877 --> 00:31:48,311
I didn't mean to eat it all.

588
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:50,609
It was just so good.
I'm sorry.

589
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,445
Oh, honey, don't be upset.

590
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:55,042
Old mean Vera here
was just kidding.

591
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,145
We got plenty.

592
00:31:58,223 --> 00:32:00,054
Tosha, sweetheart,

593
00:32:00,124 --> 00:32:02,354
do me a favor,
go check on your sister.

594
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:06,260
- So sweet.
- Yeah.

595
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:08,356
I'm sorry. We've just been
having it...

596
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:10,230
- kinda rough lately.
- Mm-hmm.

597
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,633
Well, get up there.
Have a seat. Sit down, honey.

598
00:32:12,704 --> 00:32:14,569
- Take a load off.
- Come on.

599
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:16,937
- Thank you.
- Here.

600
00:32:17,008 --> 00:32:19,636
Oh, thanks.

601
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:23,374
I lost my job lately, but even
before then, it was... it was...

602
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:25,473
it was kinda tough.

603
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,485
- God will make a way. Won't He, Sarah?
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:30,316
Sure wanna believe that.

605
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:34,381
You must believe it, baby,
and don't you be ashamed to speak out.

606
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:36,723
We got your back.

607
00:32:36,794 --> 00:32:39,820
'Cause I remember when my
husband died, if it wasn't for family,

608
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:42,458
I don't know how me and my two girls
would have made it.

609
00:32:42,534 --> 00:32:44,525
I don't have much family.

610
00:32:44,602 --> 00:32:47,730
- Where these kids' daddy at?
- They're not in our lives.

611
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:50,171
- They?!
- Vera.

612
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:53,841
- Yeah, they.
- As in...

613
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:56,073
more than one?

614
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:58,741
- Three.
- Vera.

615
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:01,376
Stay out of her business.

616
00:33:01,452 --> 00:33:03,386
Well...

617
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:06,389
I wasn't trying to get in her business.
I'm gonna help her out.

618
00:33:06,457 --> 00:33:08,584
Here, this should help
you get a little bit.

619
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,027
- Uh, no no no. I can't take that.
- It's the South, baby.

620
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:13,927
You can take it.
It'll help out a little bit.

621
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:15,590
No no no, thank you.

622
00:33:17,502 --> 00:33:19,595
I'm gonna go
check on my kids.

623
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:27,638
Vera! $10, Vera? $10!

624
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:29,543
What is she gonna do
with $10, Vera?

625
00:33:29,614 --> 00:33:32,947
First of all, she gonna buy
that kid a box of perm.

626
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:36,248
- You see that child's head?!
- She has dreads.

627
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:38,755
Dreads.
Let me spell that for you:

628
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:42,054
N-A-P-P-Y.
Pshh!

629
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:47,458
Uh-oh, watch the tree.

630
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:49,500
All right, this game's points.

631
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:53,199
- Be nice to him. Don't be...
- Whoa whoa whoa.

632
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,762
- Oh!
- Oooh!

633
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,400
What happened?

634
00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:00,671
- Oh, I see what happened.
- Hey!

635
00:34:00,745 --> 00:34:02,940
- Did you win?
- You know it, Mama.

636
00:34:03,014 --> 00:34:04,413
Aw, that's my baby.

637
00:34:04,482 --> 00:34:06,006
You said you want some of this?

638
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:08,814
I got on my clothes,
my basketball clothes. You ready?

639
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:10,751
Come on.
Gimme the ball.

640
00:34:10,822 --> 00:34:13,791
You... don't stand there
looking like you ain't never seen this.

641
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:16,725
Come on.
You wanna play?

642
00:34:19,197 --> 00:34:20,425
Hey.

643
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:22,959
Hey.

644
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:25,298
Harry, Brenda;
Brenda, Harry.

645
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,803
Harry's a friend of the family.

646
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,771
- We met already.
- Oh yeah?

647
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,070
In Chicago. She kicked me
out of her house...

648
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:33,975
when I told her her son had
potential to play pro ball.

649
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:35,808
And what, you didn't
believe him?

650
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,871
If Harry says it's true,
then it's the truth.

651
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,917
So, what, you decided
to stalk us?

652
00:34:39,984 --> 00:34:42,009
No.

653
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:44,179
- This is where I live.
- What?

654
00:34:44,255 --> 00:34:46,018
Harry, you see him foul me?

655
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,115
You fouled me. Didn't...
you seen him, Harry?

656
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,716
He fouled me.
You hit me on the leg.

657
00:34:49,794 --> 00:34:51,659
Excuse me.
Let me go ref this game.

658
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:54,525
Game point!

659
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,658
I'd still like to take
you out to lunch.

660
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:59,066
Dinner's ready, you guys.

661
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:00,661
That's my cue.
I'm coming, Cora!

662
00:35:00,738 --> 00:35:02,501
Ooh.

663
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:07,510
Michael, come on. It's time
for dinner. I need you to wash up.

664
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:11,480
- All right.
- It was really good seeing you again.

665
00:35:12,784 --> 00:35:14,217
Harry.

666
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:16,719
- Huh?
- Harry.

667
00:35:16,788 --> 00:35:19,120
Harry.

668
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,522
Sly dog. Ha ha ha!

669
00:35:21,592 --> 00:35:23,787
- I'll talk to you after dinner.
- Whoa whoa whoa!

670
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:25,294
Man, hey hey.

671
00:35:25,363 --> 00:35:27,695
You didn't hear that?

672
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:30,290
What, is that your way of asking
to stay for dinner?

673
00:35:30,368 --> 00:35:33,030
- Why, thank you.
- Whoa whoa whoa.

674
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:38,207
If you trying to holler at her, man, you
need to come out of that sweaty shirt.

675
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:40,244
Right.

676
00:35:40,311 --> 00:35:42,506
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

677
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,309
Hey, I'll save you a seat.

678
00:35:44,382 --> 00:35:47,681
- Hey, right next to her.
- All right.

679
00:35:47,752 --> 00:35:50,846
And that was when we all
cried like babies.

680
00:35:50,922 --> 00:35:53,152
You don't know how
to tell no stories.

681
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:55,624
L.B., Vera, y'all remember when

682
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:57,558
Daddy tried to teach us
how to swim?

683
00:35:57,628 --> 00:35:59,721
- No, I don't remember that.
- Oh, I remember.

684
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:02,425
I remember it because it was
like it was yesterday.

685
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,903
I remember it was
Christmas Eve, 19...

686
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:08,029
1940-something,
whatever.

687
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:09,733
I remember.

688
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:11,604
Daddy said he couldn't get us
nothing for Christmas.

689
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:13,769
So he come in and he said,
"I'm gonna get the truck ready."

690
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:16,040
- He loaded up horse on the truck.
- Uh-huh.

691
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:17,775
You know, we ain't have
no engine in the truck.

692
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:20,613
We just had a, you know,
old one-horsepower truck.

693
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:22,050
- That was the horse.
- Giddy-up.

694
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,587
Yeah, giddy-up, giddy-up.

695
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:26,987
We went down to that river.
I didn't want to jump in right off.

696
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:28,889
That water was 50-below zero!

697
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,894
- Whoo!
- Sho'nuff.

698
00:36:30,962 --> 00:36:33,863
Daddy got out there and he said,
"Get in the water!"

699
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:36,126
And I said, "I ain't
getting in that water!"

700
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,168
And he looked at me, he had
an extension cord in his hand.

701
00:36:38,236 --> 00:36:39,703
I didn't want to be no disobedient.

702
00:36:39,771 --> 00:36:42,399
So I got to that water
and I looked at it,

703
00:36:42,473 --> 00:36:45,965
and I teenched up there
and then I teeter-tottered.

704
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:47,908
- Whoo.
- I teeter-tottered.

705
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:50,641
Teeter-totter, next thing
you know...

706
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:52,478
bang!

707
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:56,643
I never learned to swim.

708
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:59,349
I couldn't get the rhythm
of the stroke.

709
00:36:59,423 --> 00:37:02,415
Why is it that I felt
that I might choke?

710
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:05,621
Mr. Brown is crazy.

711
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:08,893
Harry, how is your mother?

712
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:11,594
- She's good.
- Uh-huh.

713
00:37:11,669 --> 00:37:14,467
I'm glad she's good 'cause I know
she almost had a heart attack

714
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:17,508
when she heard about all that trouble
you were in with all that illegal...

715
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:19,167
Mama! Want some cake?

716
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:21,177
Gimme the part
where they got that rum

717
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:24,078
sopped up in there. Gimme that piece.
Gimme just that rum piece.

718
00:37:24,148 --> 00:37:25,638
I'm just glad to see you all right

719
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:28,446
'cause I was praying for you.

720
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,646
That prayer didn't get
no higher than the ceiling.

721
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:35,017
- Mom.
- What, baby?

722
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:37,390
- I got a tummy ache.
- Oh, honey,

723
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:39,452
that's probably
because you ate too much.

724
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,124
- Let me get you something.
- Don't worry about it, Ma.

725
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,065
- I'll take care of her.
- Thank you.

726
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:46,228
Young man, you know
where you going?

727
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:48,295
Oh, yes, sir.
Excuse me a minute.

728
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,363
Come on, Mike.

729
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:51,806
All right. Night, baby.

730
00:37:51,876 --> 00:37:52,900
- Good night.
- Night.

731
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:54,376
- Night.
- Later, Mike.

732
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:57,505
Brenda, he seems like
such a nice young man.

733
00:37:57,582 --> 00:37:59,106
Thank you. He is.

734
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:00,844
I couldn't make it without him.

735
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,384
You know what? Now just a minute,
just a minute.

736
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:07,413
I'm just curious. Anybody else at this
table want to know who this woman is?

737
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:12,087
- Vera!
- All day y'all been skirting the issue.

738
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:14,393
I want to know
who this woman is.

739
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:17,059
- Mama...
- No no, uh uh uh uh!

740
00:38:17,134 --> 00:38:19,329
Who are you?

741
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:26,972
Well, um...

742
00:38:27,044 --> 00:38:30,980
apparently Pop Brown
was my daddy.

743
00:38:31,048 --> 00:38:33,073
- What?
- Huh-uh, you's a liar.

744
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,845
Apparently nothing.
You a liar!

745
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:36,682
Huh-uh, the devil is a liar.

746
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:40,212
Oh, hell to the no.
My daddy wasn't no rolling stone.

747
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,986
Well, that's what
my mama said.

748
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:44,721
- Who's your mama?
- Her name was Carol Cassidy.

749
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:46,319
I don't know no Cassidy.
Who's that?

750
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,730
I ain't got no reason
not to tell the truth.

751
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,098
W-wait a minute.
I got something.

752
00:38:52,169 --> 00:38:54,501
Yeah, let's see what you got.

753
00:38:54,572 --> 00:38:56,836
Look at her.
She does look just like us.

754
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:59,638
Look, I'm the baby of this family.
She ain't coming up in here.

755
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,338
All that attitude and carrying on.
"We're from Chicago."

756
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:04,074
What you got, girl?

757
00:39:04,148 --> 00:39:06,810
I got this letter and it
told me to come down here.

758
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:09,182
Let me see this.
It's L.B.'s writing.

759
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:11,346
- L.B., what the hell is this?
- L. B?

760
00:39:11,422 --> 00:39:13,754
- What the hell is it?
- What's going on, L. B?

761
00:39:13,824 --> 00:39:17,225
- Yeah, L.B., what's going on?
- I know all about this.

762
00:39:17,295 --> 00:39:20,025
Papa Brown been talking
to you about her?

763
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:22,395
Yes, her and her mother.

764
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:24,559
You see, when Pop Brown
got real sick,

765
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:28,332
he started to tell me everything
about his past life.

766
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:32,399
You know, before he got saved
and became a deacon.

767
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:34,273
So you mean to tell me...

768
00:39:34,345 --> 00:39:36,404
you have a sister?

769
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,414
Yep, and her mother

770
00:39:38,482 --> 00:39:40,882
was the love of his life
in Chicago.

771
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:42,544
Oh, really?

772
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,781
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Huh-uh-uh!

773
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:47,050
'Cause I don't agree.
What are you saying?

774
00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:49,684
You see, when Pop Brown
was in Chicago,

775
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,387
he was a pimp.

776
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:54,431
And her mother was
his bottom ho.

777
00:39:54,498 --> 00:39:56,864
You don't talk
about my daddy.

778
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:59,129
Hell to the no,
this is blasphemy.

779
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:02,604
L.B., you don't talk about my daddy
like this, not at the dinner table.

780
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:06,165
- Our daddy was a saint.
- Your daddy was a pimp!

781
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:11,346
He was not a pim... my daddy
used to date nice women.

782
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:13,383
- Remember sweet Sadie?
- Yes.

783
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:16,045
- Good girl.
- She was one of his whores.

784
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,556
- Ho ho.
- What about Agnes with the freckles?

785
00:40:19,623 --> 00:40:21,488
She was a good girl... Agnes.

786
00:40:23,427 --> 00:40:24,985
Freckle-faced ho.

787
00:40:25,062 --> 00:40:26,962
What about Arnette?

788
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:31,563
- Latin ho.
- What about Tommy Lee?

789
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,136
- Backdoor whore.
- What about Shirley?

790
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:37,936
Shirley, the one that used to make
cupcakes for me when I was a child.

791
00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:40,739
Please don't tell me Shirley was no ho.
What about Shirley?

792
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:43,609
- City ho.
- Miss Edna?

793
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:46,149
She's a double ho.

794
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:49,311
What about L.B. mama?

795
00:40:52,223 --> 00:40:53,520
L. B?

796
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:57,789
Nasty ho.

797
00:40:57,862 --> 00:41:00,228
Ain't nothing going
on here but the truth.

798
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:06,761
Brenda, you sure you okay?

799
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:08,498
Oh yeah. I'll be fine.

800
00:41:08,572 --> 00:41:10,836
But it's a good thing
this funeral's tomorrow

801
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:14,469
- so I can get out of here.
- Let me welcome you to the Brown family.

802
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:18,709
- Some welcome.
- I know it.

803
00:41:18,783 --> 00:41:21,115
This is getting pretty full.
I should take it out.

804
00:41:21,185 --> 00:41:22,914
Oh, okay. You sure
you want to do that?

805
00:41:22,987 --> 00:41:25,080
- Yeah, where?
- Just take it right out front.

806
00:41:29,293 --> 00:41:31,727
Ladies, I'm gonna say
good night.

807
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:34,959
- Well, good night.
- Nice meeting you.

808
00:41:35,032 --> 00:41:37,398
Nice meeting you too.

809
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:46,006
- Hey, let me help you with that.
- Oh, I got it.

810
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:48,807
Around here men do that.

811
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:51,279
Where I'm from women do it all.

812
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,352
Well, then maybe
you should live here.

813
00:41:58,422 --> 00:42:00,356
God forbid.

814
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:03,621
What?
What's wrong with my town?

815
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:06,993
- You call this a town?
- Yeah.

816
00:42:07,064 --> 00:42:09,498
It's calming.

817
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,194
It's too quiet here.

818
00:42:11,268 --> 00:42:14,066
Then maybe you should let me
show you how great a town it is.

819
00:42:14,138 --> 00:42:18,006
You know, I'm here for my father's funeral
and you're flirting with me.

820
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:20,236
That is in poor taste.

821
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:22,438
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

822
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:26,508
Good night.

823
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:28,279
Good night.

824
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:47,793
Well, we are here today to say

825
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:50,807
- goodbye...
- Lord, that's my daddy!

826
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,809
...to one of our dear
beloved sons.

827
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:54,902
Daddy, you should've
let me go with you!

828
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:56,640
Daddy!

829
00:42:56,714 --> 00:43:00,081
Mom, Mom, take it easy.
Sit down, Mom.

830
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:02,119
And I need you to understand

831
00:43:02,186 --> 00:43:05,815
that God will see you
through all this, sister.

832
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:10,952
What the hell does
he got on his head?

833
00:43:11,028 --> 00:43:14,520
- And you must realize that...
- Monster, Mama, monster.

834
00:43:14,598 --> 00:43:17,931
- Baby, it's all right.
...in this hour of bereavement,

835
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:21,335
there is such
a word as comfort.

836
00:43:21,405 --> 00:43:24,238
Yeah, Southern Comfort!
Yes, sir!

837
00:43:24,308 --> 00:43:26,970
- Hmph.
- And God is faithful

838
00:43:27,044 --> 00:43:30,775
- to do exactly what he says he's gonna do.
- Preacher? Excuse me, Pastor?

839
00:43:30,848 --> 00:43:33,282
He do, He do!

840
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,544
Psst!

841
00:43:34,618 --> 00:43:36,347
- l...
- Put me on the program.

842
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,513
I wanted to say something
about my daddy.

843
00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:41,353
- Don't, please.
- You can put me on program.

844
00:43:41,425 --> 00:43:43,188
I'm trying to do
the sermon, please.

845
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,195
- I'm preaching right now.
- You ain't doing no...

846
00:43:46,263 --> 00:43:48,754
you ain't doing no good job.
You're boring everybody.

847
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:51,392
Look at my daddy's face.

848
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,264
Deacon, he dead.

849
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,831
- Put me on the program.
- I need to finish my sermon.

850
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,070
- Remember that...
- Psst!

851
00:44:01,145 --> 00:44:03,773
You can let me say something
about my daddy. He my daddy.

852
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:06,509
- Is he your daddy? Act like he your daddy.
- All right.

853
00:44:06,584 --> 00:44:08,745
- Just put me on the program.
- Come on.

854
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,650
- Oh, Daddy!
- All right.

855
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:13,019
Now I have more to say,
but right now

856
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,183
his son Leroy Brown

857
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:17,750
has a few words
that he wants to say.

858
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:20,422
Leroy Brown, come on
and say something

859
00:44:20,497 --> 00:44:21,759
right up on that.

860
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:23,459
- Me?
- Oh yes.

861
00:44:23,534 --> 00:44:25,468
- What?
- Let's go. Come on now.

862
00:44:25,536 --> 00:44:27,868
- Shut your mouth. Is he sure?
- Yes, Deacon.

863
00:44:27,938 --> 00:44:30,498
- They want me to say something?
- Come on up here, Deacon.

864
00:44:30,574 --> 00:44:31,836
I don't know what to say.

865
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,604
You want me to say
something, L. B?

866
00:44:33,677 --> 00:44:36,168
- Till we all dead.
- Okay.

867
00:44:36,247 --> 00:44:38,511
I'm "nerveless."

868
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:42,211
I didn't plan on saying
nothing today.

869
00:44:42,286 --> 00:44:46,086
I just was in my room and I
jotted down a few things.

870
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:48,920
- Can y'all hear me?
- Go on, Brown. Go on, baby.

871
00:44:48,993 --> 00:44:51,791
Is this on?

872
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:53,454
It's on.

873
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,125
I didn't plan on saying nothing.
Let the church say "amend."

874
00:44:57,201 --> 00:45:01,433
- Amen.
- Let the church say "amend" again.

875
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:03,132
Amen.

876
00:45:03,207 --> 00:45:07,143
I want to let everybody know
today that Daddy died happy.

877
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:10,237
He was happy...
I'm gonna miss my daddy.

878
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:11,975
Bye-bye, Daddy.

879
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:13,949
My daddy loved his people...

880
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:17,977
I'm getting sick of this. It don't take nobody
that long to put nobody in the ground.

881
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:20,888
- Stay calm, stay calm.
- I am calm. I'm just sick of it.

882
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,950
He'll always be right here, y'all,

883
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:25,518
right here in my heart.

884
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:29,088
And I won't chatter no...
this ain't no funeral.

885
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:31,396
- This is a "celebrate."
- Yeah!

886
00:45:31,468 --> 00:45:33,902
And we here to celebrate Daddy.

887
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:36,132
And I'm telling y'all today,

888
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:39,107
- my daddy was a happy man.
- Sit down!

889
00:45:39,176 --> 00:45:41,440
- That's what we need...
- Sit down, Brown!

890
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:44,310
- more superheroes in this church.
We need peoples

891
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:46,781
that'll stand up and be
heroes for the Lord.

892
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,512
- That's enough.
- Show him, baby.

893
00:45:50,888 --> 00:45:52,856
Oh God.

894
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:55,255
I gotta stop smoking.

895
00:45:55,326 --> 00:45:58,762
# Amazing #

896
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:02,162
# Gra-a-a-ace #

897
00:46:02,232 --> 00:46:05,463
# How sweet, yes #

898
00:46:05,536 --> 00:46:07,800
# The sound... #

899
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,931
One more time, Sarah.
She got one more time.

900
00:46:11,008 --> 00:46:14,466
Jesus, why?
Tell me why?

901
00:46:14,545 --> 00:46:18,276
That's it. Vera's really getting
on my nerves.

902
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:21,216
# That saves... #

903
00:46:21,285 --> 00:46:26,655
# A wre-eeee-etch #

904
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:30,353
# Like me-eee... #

905
00:46:33,564 --> 00:46:35,998
- Uncle L. B!
- L.B., what's wrong with you?

906
00:46:36,066 --> 00:46:38,364
You wanna go with her?
There's room for you too, you know?

907
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:40,096
I'll wait.

908
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:45,266
I'm the baby of this family
and I deserve some respect.

909
00:46:45,342 --> 00:46:47,742
- Right.
- L.B. pushed me in that grave.

910
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:49,284
I know, Mama. I know.

911
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:51,514
Everybody's act a fool.

912
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:54,558
Should have let them put the dirt
on you too... acting a damn fool.

913
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,957
- Calm down, everybody.
- That's just crazy!

914
00:46:57,028 --> 00:46:58,325
Uh, hey, y'all.

915
00:46:58,396 --> 00:47:00,660
It was nice meeting
all of you, but, um...

916
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:02,596
- I think we're gonna go now.
- Oh no.

917
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:06,228
You have to stay till tomorrow
for the reading of the will.

918
00:47:06,304 --> 00:47:08,966
- Yeah.
- No! Daddy ain't left her nothing.

919
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:14,171
No, um, I really think
we ought to be going.

920
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:16,270
You can't leave, baby,

921
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:19,680
'cause... the bus only
come every three days.

922
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,685
- It'll be here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, what?

923
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:25,313
- It'll be okay.
- No no!

924
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:27,721
I gotta go.
l... no...

925
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:29,885
You know what?
You know what I'm gonna do?

926
00:47:29,961 --> 00:47:32,623
I'm gonna go change and I'm gonna
be back in 15 minutes.

927
00:47:32,697 --> 00:47:34,665
I'm gonna take you
and your kids

928
00:47:34,732 --> 00:47:37,030
to see my town.

929
00:47:40,071 --> 00:47:41,629
Ah... you'll like it.

930
00:47:41,706 --> 00:47:44,903
- I promise.
- Okay okay okay.

931
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:47,240
- Okay, all right. Okay, all right.
- 15 minutes.

932
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:49,779
- All right.
- Oh my God.

933
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:52,907
All right, you know
I don't know you that well,

934
00:47:52,984 --> 00:47:55,578
but you'd better
watch out for him. Pshaw!

935
00:47:55,653 --> 00:47:58,178
Flashing that pretty smile...

936
00:47:58,256 --> 00:48:00,724
and that nickel-slick talk.

937
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:04,352
He done broke a lot of women's hearts
out here in these backwoods.

938
00:48:06,831 --> 00:48:09,356
You be careful... sister.

939
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,993
Brenda.

940
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:13,832
Brown, where you all at?

941
00:48:13,905 --> 00:48:14,929
We over here.

942
00:48:15,006 --> 00:48:17,167
Where that money
you owe me?

943
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:20,133
- I'm gonna give you two.
- Thank you.

944
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,509
Thank you. Gracias.

945
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,707
You didn't know
I spoke Spanish, did you?

946
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:27,046
Oooh, you should have
got one.

947
00:48:27,118 --> 00:48:28,813
See, it's not so bad.

948
00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:31,252
Hey, Harry.

949
00:48:33,758 --> 00:48:35,282
- Hey.
- Mmm.

950
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,327
One of your women?

951
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:40,057
- No, it's my cousin.
- Oh.

952
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:43,066
That don't mean nothing
down here, do it?

953
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:46,326
Oh ho.

954
00:48:46,404 --> 00:48:48,497
That's cold.

955
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:51,565
I'm kidding.

956
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:54,236
- Hi, Mommy!
- Hi, Mommy!

957
00:48:54,312 --> 00:48:57,247
Hi, baby! Oh.

958
00:48:57,315 --> 00:48:59,044
They're having fun.

959
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:01,516
Yeah.

960
00:49:04,288 --> 00:49:06,586
Why don't you have
a woman, anyway?

961
00:49:06,657 --> 00:49:09,353
- Huh?
- I'm divorced.

962
00:49:09,427 --> 00:49:11,361
Ooooh.

963
00:49:11,429 --> 00:49:13,897
Six years, three kids

964
00:49:13,965 --> 00:49:15,990
and a whole lot of drama.

965
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:18,058
My drama trumps your drama.

966
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:27,077
Hey, step right up,
step right up.

967
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:30,238
Who can get the ball in the basket?
How about you, young man?

968
00:49:30,314 --> 00:49:32,179
- Huh huh?
- Hey, Harry?

969
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:33,773
Yeah, you there, sir.

970
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,547
Get the ball in the basket,

971
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:40,352
you can win a cute little doll
for the lovely lady back there.

972
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:43,359
- Maybe you're scared.
- You got some money?

973
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:46,590
The young man's going to clean
me out of all my profits.

974
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:49,292
I'm in, but I'll just play.
Not for money.

975
00:49:50,568 --> 00:49:52,559
- Run it.
- How about every one we win

976
00:49:52,637 --> 00:49:54,002
you buy back from us?

977
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:56,232
All right.

978
00:49:57,441 --> 00:49:59,739
Keep that elbow in, all right?

979
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:02,244
That's what I'm talking, dawg.

980
00:50:02,313 --> 00:50:04,611
- Bing bing bing.
- Oh ho ho!

981
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:05,979
That's good form.

982
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,484
That's the difference
right there, man.

983
00:50:08,552 --> 00:50:10,486
Come on, man, get some more,
get some more animals, man...

984
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:13,580
- Oh, man, look at you.
- Too easy.

985
00:50:18,162 --> 00:50:20,995
- Tosha, take this in the house for Mama.
- Okay.

986
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:23,033
Hey, wait up.

987
00:50:28,506 --> 00:50:31,202
Hey, man, here's your cut.

988
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:33,743
Oh no, you keep it.

989
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:38,306
Thanks.

990
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,788
Think I'm winning him over.

991
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:47,323
Don't be so sure about that.

992
00:50:49,393 --> 00:50:52,885
He hasn't really had
a real man in his life.

993
00:50:52,963 --> 00:50:55,796
And I sure can't afford
to let another one come running in

994
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:57,857
and out of it.

995
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,835
Is it his life or your life
we're talking about?

996
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:08,606
What?

997
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:11,045
I don't know who
you're protecting, you or him.

998
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:16,885
Both of us, I guess.

999
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:21,224
I see.

1000
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:23,624
You really think
he's that good?

1001
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:27,530
I do.

1002
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:31,090
Well, how would that work?
I mean, how would you coach him?

1003
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:33,568
I mean, you're here.
He's with me in Chicago.

1004
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:36,162
And look, he's not
moving down here.

1005
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,105
I can make a few trips up there,

1006
00:51:38,175 --> 00:51:40,507
give him some drills.

1007
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:43,138
Maybe in the summer,
he can do a camp

1008
00:51:43,214 --> 00:51:45,444
with me and some
of the other players.

1009
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:49,350
Hmm, what about
his education?

1010
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,978
I promise you

1011
00:51:51,055 --> 00:51:54,456
he'll come back
smarter than he left.

1012
00:51:57,294 --> 00:52:01,094
Yeah, well, I'll think about it.

1013
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:03,395
- Take your time.
- I have to ask him.

1014
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:06,436
Yeah, do that.

1015
00:52:08,506 --> 00:52:10,371
Hey, thank you for the day.

1016
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:12,409
I really appreciate it.

1017
00:52:12,476 --> 00:52:15,104
No, thank you.

1018
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:16,339
Goodbye...

1019
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:19,382
and thank you
so much, Harry.

1020
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,019
Goodbye.

1021
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:29,092
Oh.

1022
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:39,663
It's for you.

1023
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:45,938
Thanks.

1024
00:53:00,558 --> 00:53:02,719
Excuse me.

1025
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:06,426
I'm just gonna go and pack.

1026
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:08,431
No, you are gonna stay

1027
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:10,626
for the reading
of the will, aren't you?

1028
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:13,693
Oh, no no no no.

1029
00:53:13,771 --> 00:53:16,501
Stay? Daddy didn't
leave her nothing.

1030
00:53:16,574 --> 00:53:18,838
- Vera.
- You should stay.

1031
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:20,843
- No, really.
- Come on.

1032
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:22,776
Come on, sit down.

1033
00:53:22,847 --> 00:53:25,213
- Come on over here.
- He your daddy too.

1034
00:53:25,282 --> 00:53:28,183
Brenda, come on.

1035
00:53:28,252 --> 00:53:29,879
Come on.
Come on in here now.

1036
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:31,819
Come on, you'll probably
thank me too.

1037
00:53:31,889 --> 00:53:33,584
You're Daddy's child,
you may as well.

1038
00:53:33,657 --> 00:53:35,318
- You never know.
- Why don't you shut...

1039
00:53:35,392 --> 00:53:36,825
Sit down now, sit sit.

1040
00:53:36,894 --> 00:53:38,225
L.B., she ain't no puppy.

1041
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:40,229
What, you gonna have
her sit and do tricks?

1042
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:42,822
Brother Sam, you read
the last will and "testicles."

1043
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,733
Yeah, that's what
I've been waiting for.

1044
00:53:45,803 --> 00:53:47,828
I got dressed up
for this. Come on.

1045
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:49,463
Okay, folks...

1046
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,304
Pop Brown's last
will and testament.

1047
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,469
Here it is.

1048
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:58,242
"To L.B. and his
beautiful wife Sarah..."

1049
00:53:58,315 --> 00:54:01,307
Beautiful? Must have been blind,
crippled and crazy.

1050
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:05,346
"...I leave all my money..."

1051
00:54:05,422 --> 00:54:07,947
- Whoo! Thank you, Daddy.
- Sweet!

1052
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:12,758
- "...a total amount of $575."
- You rich! You rich!

1053
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,424
- That ain't nothing.
- What? 500?

1054
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:18,229
We... we took care
of that sucker till he died.

1055
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:20,497
He just leave us
nothing but that?

1056
00:54:20,571 --> 00:54:23,404
$575.

1057
00:54:23,474 --> 00:54:26,443
I washed his toes
and cleaned his nose!

1058
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:29,104
He's so happy he can't
get his words out. He's rich.

1059
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:30,737
And and and...
keep reading, baby.

1060
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:33,282
- "To Vera..."
- Yes.

1061
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:36,285
"...I leave all my love."

1062
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:37,718
Love, yes, and...

1063
00:54:37,788 --> 00:54:39,983
"May it keep you warm at night."

1064
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,559
There's got to be more.
You keep reading, baby.

1065
00:54:43,627 --> 00:54:45,618
Keep reading 'cause I know
there's more for me.

1066
00:54:45,696 --> 00:54:47,561
"And to Brown..."

1067
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:49,690
Oh, boy, this is good.

1068
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:51,894
"...I leave my house."

1069
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:53,766
The house?

1070
00:54:53,837 --> 00:54:57,295
I'd rather have the love.
That house is tore up, Brown.

1071
00:54:57,374 --> 00:54:59,433
Shut up, Vera.
We grew up in that house.

1072
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:02,377
Yeah, us and several families

1073
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:05,108
of rats and roaches.
What the hell is that?

1074
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:07,548
"To my daughter Brenda..."

1075
00:55:07,618 --> 00:55:09,313
- Brenda?
- Brenda?

1076
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:13,186
- Wh...
- "...I leave my old rental property."

1077
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:16,749
Oh, Brenda,
that's wonderful.

1078
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:19,125
He left me a house?

1079
00:55:50,294 --> 00:55:53,127
Do you think we're living here?

1080
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:55,495
Do you think
we're living here now?

1081
00:55:55,566 --> 00:55:59,229
Okay, well, it has potential.

1082
00:55:59,303 --> 00:56:02,363
Potential to be torn down.

1083
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:04,168
Is this our house, Mama?

1084
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:06,175
Looks that way, baby.

1085
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:08,768
- I'm gonna go back to the projects.
- Yeah, me too.

1086
00:56:08,846 --> 00:56:10,404
Me three.

1087
00:56:12,383 --> 00:56:14,681
I'd stay with you, brother.

1088
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:21,424
Hmm.

1089
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:31,960
Come on.

1090
00:56:32,036 --> 00:56:34,004
At least go inside.

1091
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:37,000
All right, but, Tosha, Lena,

1092
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:39,474
y'all wait in the car.
Come on, go ahead.

1093
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:41,511
Looks dangerous in here.

1094
00:56:44,982 --> 00:56:46,643
Ma.

1095
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:50,553
It got a welcome mat.

1096
00:56:57,394 --> 00:56:59,362
Ooh.

1097
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:06,362
- It's a nice house.
- Really?

1098
00:57:06,437 --> 00:57:08,769
What you looking at?

1099
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:12,708
It just needs a little work.

1100
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:15,267
This house don't need
no little nothing.

1101
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:17,438
- Ma, come on.
- What?

1102
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:19,448
Can we please get out of here?

1103
00:57:19,516 --> 00:57:21,108
I'm not trying to miss the bus.

1104
00:57:21,185 --> 00:57:24,382
Could you just give me a minute?
Let me ask you something.

1105
00:57:24,455 --> 00:57:27,356
What do you think about
Harry coaching you?

1106
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:30,655
- Hmm?
- I'm cool with it if it gets us out of here.

1107
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:35,094
Oh, he cool with it.

1108
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:36,598
That's good.

1109
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:39,295
Uh-huh.

1110
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:42,634
You know, I really wish
you weren't leaving.

1111
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:46,164
Well, gotta get back to my life.

1112
00:57:46,243 --> 00:57:49,110
- Ma, come on!
- I'm coming.

1113
00:57:54,451 --> 00:57:56,419
Brenda, you leaving
me so soon?

1114
00:57:56,487 --> 00:57:58,751
Yeah, we got to be heading back.

1115
00:57:58,822 --> 00:58:00,722
Okay, well, look,
here's my number.

1116
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,520
I want you to keep in touch, okay?

1117
00:58:02,593 --> 00:58:05,460
- Oh, I will.
- All right.

1118
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:07,087
And here...

1119
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:09,564
What's this?

1120
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:12,466
It's from me and Sarah.
We wanted to bless you with something.

1121
00:58:12,536 --> 00:58:14,697
No, Cora, no. No, I can't.

1122
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:17,035
- No, take it.
- I can't.

1123
00:58:17,107 --> 00:58:19,541
You have to take it.
We wanted to bless you with it.

1124
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,635
It's just a little something.
Brenda, please.

1125
00:58:21,712 --> 00:58:23,942
Ain't no telling when
I'd be able to pay y'all back.

1126
00:58:24,014 --> 00:58:26,005
Oh, honey,
don't worry about that.

1127
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:28,381
If some of these fathers
don't take care of these babies,

1128
00:58:28,452 --> 00:58:31,387
then us single mothers have
to stick together. Please take it.

1129
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,750
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1130
00:58:36,827 --> 00:58:39,819
This is the nicest thing
that anybody's ever done for me.

1131
00:58:39,897 --> 00:58:41,922
- Really?
- Yeah.

1132
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:44,160
Well, maybe you need
to change your friends.

1133
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:50,028
- Thank you, thank you.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

1134
00:58:59,383 --> 00:59:01,977
- What did he say?
- Yeah, he hiring all right,

1135
00:59:02,052 --> 00:59:03,986
but not for the job
he advertising for.

1136
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:06,454
- I go kill him now.
- No no no no.

1137
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:08,650
- Cheryl.
- Let me go.

1138
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:11,353
Stop it, calm down.

1139
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:15,262
Hey, don't you wanna
hear about my trip, huh?

1140
00:59:15,332 --> 00:59:18,267
- You never told me about the trip.
- Don't ask.

1141
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:20,826
- Brenda, you just...
- I'm just kidding.

1142
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:22,963
Did he leave you
anything at least?

1143
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,508
Yeah, a house.

1144
00:59:25,576 --> 00:59:28,067
- When are we moving?
- Huh-uh, girl, it's so raggedy.

1145
00:59:28,145 --> 00:59:30,841
You can't live in it.
Compared to that, we live in a palace.

1146
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:32,506
Brenda, don't be selfish.

1147
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,608
Let's move to Georgia
so I can find me one

1148
00:59:34,685 --> 00:59:37,779
of those big old
Jethro-looking papis

1149
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:40,846
so I can cucuchanga.

1150
00:59:40,924 --> 00:59:43,859
Girl, you know what?
I think I might have met somebody

1151
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:45,861
- who'd be just your style.
- For me?

1152
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:47,157
Uh-huh.

1153
00:59:47,231 --> 00:59:49,199
His name's Brown.

1154
00:59:51,301 --> 00:59:54,930
I got it.

1155
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:57,838
Who is it?

1156
00:59:57,908 --> 00:59:59,933
Hey.

1157
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,807
Hey.

1158
01:00:03,513 --> 01:00:05,538
What you doing here?

1159
01:00:05,616 --> 01:00:07,550
I've been thinking
about what you said,

1160
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:09,779
and I'm gonna help you out.

1161
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:12,947
So can I come in,

1162
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:14,957
please?

1163
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:20,959
Yeah.

1164
01:00:21,031 --> 01:00:22,999
Come on in.

1165
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:38,147
Damn, girl, this how you live?

1166
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,914
You gonna give me
some money or not?

1167
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:44,715
What you gonna give me, huh?

1168
01:00:44,788 --> 01:00:47,814
I ain't gonna
give you nothing.

1169
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:51,383
- Aw, come on, girl, damn it.
- No, stop it, stop it.

1170
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:54,021
You oughta wanna do the right thing
and take care of your son.

1171
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:55,792
- You're right.
- Why I gotta threaten you

1172
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:57,629
with child support
to take care of him?

1173
01:00:57,701 --> 01:00:59,293
Damn, Brenda, do it.

1174
01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:02,930
- The boy probably ain't mine anyway.
- You bastard!

1175
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:04,530
You need this money,
don't you, right?

1176
01:01:04,608 --> 01:01:06,235
So come on, baby,
where's the bedroom?

1177
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:09,143
No, stop it. I don't sleep
with men for money.

1178
01:01:09,212 --> 01:01:12,511
Well, your mama used to,
didn't she?

1179
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:15,517
I ain't my mama. Get the hell
out of my house!

1180
01:01:18,588 --> 01:01:21,819
Forget you then.
You all ain't getting nothing.

1181
01:01:21,892 --> 01:01:24,224
I don't care if both of y'all
starve to death.

1182
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:27,593
You bastard. You would
do that to your own son?

1183
01:01:27,664 --> 01:01:29,632
- Hey.
- You're just evil.

1184
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,158
I told you when you was pregnant I
didn't give a damn about you or the boy.

1185
01:01:33,236 --> 01:01:36,672
Matter of fact, what did you do with
the $200 I gave you for the abortion?

1186
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,833
I'll bet you wish
you had that $200 now.

1187
01:01:38,909 --> 01:01:41,377
- Don't you?
- Hey, Michael, baby.

1188
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:45,339
Hey, Mike. What's up, boy?

1189
01:01:48,085 --> 01:01:50,349
Mama, why you begging like this?

1190
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,650
No no, he ain't gotta help us.

1191
01:01:52,723 --> 01:01:54,816
No, I know how to make some things
happen on my own.

1192
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:56,722
You don't need
to beg this motherf...

1193
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:58,988
Leave it.
He's still your father.

1194
01:01:59,062 --> 01:02:02,031
- Get your hand out of my face.
- Boy, better watch your mouth!

1195
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:05,034
- No, no, it's not worth it.
- Mama, are you defending him?

1196
01:02:05,102 --> 01:02:07,662
Look, if you ain't
man enough to help us,

1197
01:02:07,738 --> 01:02:10,798
I know how to make some things
happen on my own.

1198
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:13,342
- No, baby. Where are you going?
- No no.

1199
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:15,378
Michael! Mike, stop him.

1200
01:02:15,445 --> 01:02:18,039
That boy ain't my responsibility.
It isn't my problem.

1201
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:24,444
No, Michael!

1202
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:26,386
Michael!

1203
01:02:52,783 --> 01:02:54,216
Michael.

1204
01:02:54,284 --> 01:02:56,081
- Hey.
- Hey.

1205
01:02:56,153 --> 01:02:58,986
Can I come in?

1206
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:01,114
Yeah yeah, come on in.

1207
01:03:08,498 --> 01:03:10,466
Have a seat.

1208
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:15,670
I'm sorry. I thought
you were Michael.

1209
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:18,640
He's not here?

1210
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,198
No.

1211
01:03:20,277 --> 01:03:23,337
Did you tell him about the practice
sessions I set up for him?

1212
01:03:23,413 --> 01:03:25,540
Yeah, I did.

1213
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:27,606
I'm sorry.

1214
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:31,477
What's going on?

1215
01:03:42,899 --> 01:03:44,560
What's up, man?

1216
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:47,125
What's up? You're just
the man I need to see.

1217
01:03:47,204 --> 01:03:48,637
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1218
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:51,731
You can't win a game
with your shoes falling off, dawg.

1219
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:54,572
- Here.
- These are for me?

1220
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:56,908
You know it. I got money
on this game, dawg.

1221
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,641
I need you on your "A."

1222
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:03,750
- Thanks, Calvin.
- It's all good, dawg.

1223
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:06,254
Hey, man,

1224
01:04:06,323 --> 01:04:07,813
you hanging tonight?

1225
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:10,121
Yeah.

1226
01:04:10,193 --> 01:04:13,128
You working?

1227
01:04:13,196 --> 01:04:14,493
Yeah.

1228
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:16,623
You want in?

1229
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:22,268
Yeah, show me
what I gotta do.

1230
01:04:22,339 --> 01:04:25,604
- All right.
- Mike.

1231
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:28,644
Who is this fool?

1232
01:04:28,712 --> 01:04:31,180
- He 5-0?
- No, man, I'll handle it.

1233
01:04:35,385 --> 01:04:37,319
Dude, what are you doing here?

1234
01:04:37,387 --> 01:04:38,820
Your mother's looking for you.

1235
01:04:38,889 --> 01:04:41,119
You got some nerve
coming around here.

1236
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:43,489
- So you gonna do this, huh?
- Why not?

1237
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,825
- You're too smart for this.
- Dude, you don't know nothing about me.

1238
01:04:46,897 --> 01:04:50,060
I know you're about
to make a stupid mistake.

1239
01:04:50,133 --> 01:04:52,192
Harry, you don't know
nothing about my life.

1240
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:54,567
You don't know
what we're up against.

1241
01:04:54,638 --> 01:04:56,731
It doesn't matter
what you're up against.

1242
01:04:56,806 --> 01:05:00,242
You could make a stupid mistake and have
everything in the world going for you.

1243
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,942
I was in the league.

1244
01:05:06,016 --> 01:05:07,574
I started gambling.

1245
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:11,212
Lost everything,
including my wife and kids.

1246
01:05:13,323 --> 01:05:16,986
I made mistakes
I'm still paying for today.

1247
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,221
I know a few things about
going down the wrong road.

1248
01:05:19,296 --> 01:05:22,595
And this is the wrong road.

1249
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:25,897
- All right, man.
- Dude,

1250
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:27,698
you better get out of here.

1251
01:05:27,771 --> 01:05:30,740
Okay.

1252
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:32,866
We're supposed to practice
tomorrow at 3:00.

1253
01:05:34,578 --> 01:05:37,376
If you show up,

1254
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:40,007
then I'll know you're as smart
as I think you are.

1255
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:43,950
Yeah, whatever, man.

1256
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,885
I'm gonna be here for two days.

1257
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:53,117
- All right?
- Yeah, let's do this.

1258
01:06:07,611 --> 01:06:09,579
Come here.

1259
01:06:19,623 --> 01:06:21,989
What?

1260
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:24,652
Where you been all night, huh?

1261
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:27,928
I was with Calvin.

1262
01:06:27,998 --> 01:06:30,330
Okay, so you're a man now.

1263
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,300
You gonna sell dope, huh?

1264
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:34,166
Now you think
that makes you a man?

1265
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:36,762
Why not, Mama?
We ain't got nothing.

1266
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,206
- Boy, are you crazy?
- No, you work like a dog,

1267
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:40,674
and what has it gotten you?

1268
01:06:40,744 --> 01:06:42,678
You talk about God
making a way.

1269
01:06:42,746 --> 01:06:44,737
Mama, I'm not trying
to die to get to heaven.

1270
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:46,338
I want mine here on earth.

1271
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,316
Then you know what?

1272
01:06:48,385 --> 01:06:50,785
You gonna have to get out
of my house then, huh?

1273
01:06:50,854 --> 01:06:53,448
You think you're grown? Go.

1274
01:06:53,523 --> 01:06:54,922
Get out!

1275
01:06:54,991 --> 01:06:56,925
Mama, where am I gonna go?

1276
01:06:56,993 --> 01:06:59,553
I don't wanna hear it.
I done my best by you.

1277
01:06:59,629 --> 01:07:02,154
I done tried. Get out.

1278
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:04,462
Who's gonna help you
with Lena and Tosha?

1279
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:06,695
Don't you even worry
about that, okay? I got that.

1280
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:08,601
You just get out.

1281
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:11,072
- No no, I'm not going, Mama.
- Go on.

1282
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:14,076
No child of mine is gonna
sell dope, you hear me?

1283
01:07:14,144 --> 01:07:17,875
I ain't sitting up in here waiting
to hear that you done got killed.

1284
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:19,778
Get out. Hit the bricks.

1285
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:21,441
No, Mama, I'm not going.

1286
01:07:21,518 --> 01:07:24,112
No, if I go, I'm a coward
just like my dad.

1287
01:07:24,187 --> 01:07:25,677
I'm your son.

1288
01:07:25,755 --> 01:07:28,383
I'm not gonna leave you
like them other dudes.

1289
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,392
Mama, I'm just tired

1290
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,553
of seeing you hurt
and struggling.

1291
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:34,153
I'm sorry.

1292
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,994
Mama, I'm sorry.

1293
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:42,194
- I'm sorry.
- We gonna be all right.

1294
01:07:42,272 --> 01:07:43,864
You hear me?

1295
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:47,000
- I'm sorry.
- We gonna be all right.

1296
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:50,843
We gonna be all right.
I promise. I promise.

1297
01:07:50,914 --> 01:07:54,145
I'm sorry, Mama.

1298
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:56,708
I love you, baby.
I love you.

1299
01:07:56,786 --> 01:07:59,914
- I love you too. I'm sorry.
- All right, all right, all right.

1300
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:02,116
Okay, just...

1301
01:08:02,192 --> 01:08:04,422
just... just go to bed, all right?

1302
01:08:04,494 --> 01:08:07,725
Go now.

1303
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:24,543
All right, let's go.
On the whistle, chest passes.

1304
01:08:24,614 --> 01:08:26,241
Passer makes the shooter.

1305
01:08:26,316 --> 01:08:29,717
Pass it like you want him
to shoot the ball.

1306
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:33,422
Are you coachable?
Do you listen?

1307
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:37,392
It's good to see you.

1308
01:08:39,195 --> 01:08:42,494
On the whistle,
chest passes.

1309
01:08:54,677 --> 01:08:57,145
- What's up, Calvin?
- What's up, dawg?

1310
01:08:57,213 --> 01:08:59,238
I won six large
on you tonight.

1311
01:08:59,315 --> 01:09:01,374
You play with heart, son.

1312
01:09:02,886 --> 01:09:05,650
Here.

1313
01:09:07,323 --> 01:09:10,053
Look, man, that's what
I came to tell you.

1314
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:12,458
Calvin, I can't do this.

1315
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:17,926
Here, this is all the money.

1316
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:20,765
It's your cut and mine.

1317
01:09:20,837 --> 01:09:23,601
I'm sorry, dude.

1318
01:09:23,673 --> 01:09:26,972
You know what?
I understand that.

1319
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:28,806
You ain't got this
in you, man.

1320
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:32,405
You go on now.
You go play basketball.

1321
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:35,474
Me? I'm gonna be
a hood rat.

1322
01:09:35,552 --> 01:09:37,076
That's all I'll ever be.

1323
01:09:37,153 --> 01:09:39,144
Calvin, you can be
whatever you want to be.

1324
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:42,453
No, kid.

1325
01:09:45,662 --> 01:09:49,154
Yo, son, you think
you can just sell on my turf?

1326
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:52,663
Mike, run!

1327
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:08,584
Mike's great. I wish he
was playing in my gym.

1328
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:11,643
What about you?
What about your house?

1329
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:13,154
What about it?

1330
01:10:13,223 --> 01:10:15,783
What you gonna do with it?

1331
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:18,657
Let it do what it's been doing
for the last whatever years.

1332
01:10:18,728 --> 01:10:20,491
Which is what?

1333
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:22,861
Sit there.

1334
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:26,493
- That ain't no good.
- Try this. You'll like it.

1335
01:10:26,569 --> 01:10:28,560
Get in there. Come on.

1336
01:10:30,073 --> 01:10:32,303
Oh, man, that's good.
What is that?

1337
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:34,536
- Is that pork?
- That's pork, baby.

1338
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:37,341
I don't even eat pork,
and that's good.

1339
01:10:55,665 --> 01:10:57,428
Brenda, I like talking to you.

1340
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,229
Thanks.

1341
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:02,567
But this is about
helping my son, right?

1342
01:11:02,639 --> 01:11:04,197
Yeah.

1343
01:11:04,274 --> 01:11:07,266
What if I also enjoy spending
as much time with you

1344
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:09,402
- as I do coaching your son?
- Harry.

1345
01:11:10,813 --> 01:11:13,077
I ain't going down
that road, okay?

1346
01:11:15,285 --> 01:11:17,276
- Thanks, girl.
- You're welcome.

1347
01:11:17,353 --> 01:11:20,186
- All right now, I work for tips.
- I know.

1348
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:22,554
- This is your neighborhood, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1349
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:24,115
It ain't so bad, is it?

1350
01:11:24,193 --> 01:11:27,526
You'd rather live here
than in your own house?

1351
01:11:27,597 --> 01:11:30,725
Well, I know this. I don't know
nothing about Georgia.

1352
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,700
So it's friends
keeping you here.

1353
01:11:32,769 --> 01:11:36,535
If I could live here,
I ain't afraid of nothing.

1354
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,767
Brenda, aye, mami.

1355
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:42,436
- Cheryl, hi, girl.
- I've been looking all over for you.

1356
01:11:42,512 --> 01:11:44,104
We have to go to the hospital.

1357
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,705
- The hospital, why?
- They shot him.

1358
01:11:46,783 --> 01:11:49,183
- What happened, Cheryl?
- Mikey... they shot him!

1359
01:11:49,252 --> 01:11:50,879
Michael.

1360
01:11:59,896 --> 01:12:01,830
I never had much of a mother,

1361
01:12:01,898 --> 01:12:05,629
so I was determined
to be the best that I could.

1362
01:12:05,702 --> 01:12:08,364
When he was young,
I gave him to the Lord.

1363
01:12:08,438 --> 01:12:10,838
I said, "Lord, protect my baby.

1364
01:12:10,907 --> 01:12:12,841
Watch him for me."

1365
01:12:12,909 --> 01:12:14,843
But I can't...

1366
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:16,811
I can't feed him.

1367
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:18,847
I can't give him what he need.

1368
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:22,851
There are nights
when I go to bed hungry

1369
01:12:22,919 --> 01:12:26,355
'cause I know they didn't
get enough to eat all day.

1370
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,590
You know, I just...

1371
01:12:32,662 --> 01:12:34,789
feel so bad.

1372
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:40,530
Why did I do this to them?

1373
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:44,300
You know, I can't even
keep 'em out of harm's way.

1374
01:12:44,374 --> 01:12:46,274
Hey hey hey hey.

1375
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:48,401
You've done more than most.

1376
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:54,444
Look, thank you.
I know you have to go.

1377
01:12:54,517 --> 01:12:55,984
No, I'm not going anywhere

1378
01:12:56,052 --> 01:12:58,577
unless you want me to go.

1379
01:12:58,654 --> 01:13:00,679
No.

1380
01:13:00,757 --> 01:13:03,317
I'm here with you.

1381
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:07,662
Thank you.

1382
01:13:11,868 --> 01:13:15,634
Hey, Brenda, what's up with all these
emergency phone calls?

1383
01:13:15,705 --> 01:13:17,673
Michael Jr.,
he was shot last night

1384
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:19,674
trying to hustle money for me.

1385
01:13:19,742 --> 01:13:21,801
But I ain't paying for no funeral.

1386
01:13:21,878 --> 01:13:24,540
He ain't dead. You bastard.

1387
01:13:24,614 --> 01:13:26,707
Hold on here. Don't call me.

1388
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,081
- You know what happened last night.
- Hey hey!

1389
01:13:29,152 --> 01:13:31,177
- Is everything all right here, Brenda?
- Yeah.

1390
01:13:31,254 --> 01:13:34,018
I'm fine.

1391
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:39,851
I gotta go to work.

1392
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:42,659
Hey hey.

1393
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:44,199
- Michael.
- What?

1394
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:49,095
This is my last $25.

1395
01:13:49,172 --> 01:13:52,073
That's what you make?
Can I buy an hour of your time

1396
01:13:52,141 --> 01:13:53,699
to spend with your son?

1397
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:58,446
Don't you call my house again.

1398
01:13:58,514 --> 01:14:01,574
You're pissing off my wife.

1399
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:10,690
- You okay?
- Miss Brown.

1400
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,058
- Yes.
- Hi. Now we managed

1401
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:15,290
to get the bullet
and stop the bleeding.

1402
01:14:15,364 --> 01:14:17,525
It's a miracle that
it missed his vital organs.

1403
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,363
Is he gonna be okay?

1404
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:21,369
Yes, he's gonna be fine.

1405
01:14:21,437 --> 01:14:22,768
I need to see him.

1406
01:14:22,839 --> 01:14:24,397
Well, he's in recovery right now,

1407
01:14:24,474 --> 01:14:26,942
but he'll be in I.C.U.
in just a little bit.

1408
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:29,204
Thank you, thank you.

1409
01:14:29,278 --> 01:14:32,111
You're welcome.
You're welcome. All right.

1410
01:14:56,572 --> 01:14:59,735
# This life can make me
so confused #

1411
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:02,175
# But it's all right #

1412
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:04,770
# Living day by day,
I feel so used #

1413
01:15:04,847 --> 01:15:07,782
# That ain't right #

1414
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:10,444
# I just want to run and hide #

1415
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,545
# But I don't have
the time to cry #

1416
01:15:12,622 --> 01:15:14,817
# It's all right #

1417
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:17,451
# It's all right, all right #

1418
01:15:19,028 --> 01:15:21,963
# Many thoughts are
runnin' through my head #

1419
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:24,192
# It's all right #

1420
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:26,929
# Wishing to be
somewhere else but here #

1421
01:15:27,003 --> 01:15:28,834
# And it's all right #

1422
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:32,369
# I can't wait
to see your face #

1423
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:34,602
# I need a smile
and your embrace #

1424
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:36,907
# I'm all right #

1425
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:40,380
# I'm all right, yeah #

1426
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:43,509
# Life can bring us
through any changes #

1427
01:15:43,586 --> 01:15:45,281
# It's all right #

1428
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,345
- # Never give up #
- # Just don't give up #

1429
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:50,256
# Know that it's
gonna be all right #

1430
01:15:51,928 --> 01:15:54,419
- # People come and they go #
- # They go #

1431
01:15:54,497 --> 01:15:57,466
# It's just the way that it goes #

1432
01:15:57,533 --> 01:15:59,228
# Everything is everything #

1433
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:02,601
# It's all right #

1434
01:16:02,672 --> 01:16:04,105
# Sometime the rain #

1435
01:16:04,173 --> 01:16:06,869
# It makes me sad
and it's all right #

1436
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:10,936
# Some things in the world
they make me mad #

1437
01:16:11,013 --> 01:16:13,504
# And it's all right #

1438
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:16,381
# In the morning
when I see the sun #

1439
01:16:16,452 --> 01:16:18,443
# I know I'm not the only one #

1440
01:16:18,521 --> 01:16:21,251
# And it's all right #

1441
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:23,485
# It's all right... #

1442
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:25,584
I can't believe you're leaving.

1443
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:27,458
I know, but you're
welcome to come.

1444
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,191
I don't think so.

1445
01:16:29,265 --> 01:16:31,597
I'll come visit
or something, but no.

1446
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:34,329
And anyways, look at that.

1447
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:35,995
You're in very good hands.

1448
01:16:36,072 --> 01:16:38,199
I know, I can't even believe
he stayed as long as he did.

1449
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:41,573
Ay, you know I don't like half
the men you've dated,

1450
01:16:41,644 --> 01:16:44,306
but this one...

1451
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:45,847
I like him a lot.

1452
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:47,746
Mmm.

1453
01:16:47,817 --> 01:16:49,478
Uh, we ain't dating.

1454
01:16:49,552 --> 01:16:52,077
Yeah, call it whatever you want.
You might not be dating him,

1455
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:55,487
- but he's definitely dating you.
- Huh-uh.

1456
01:16:55,558 --> 01:16:57,048
Come on.

1457
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:01,229
Hey, beautiful,

1458
01:17:01,297 --> 01:17:02,764
you mess with my girl,

1459
01:17:02,832 --> 01:17:06,495
I come down there
and I get you...

1460
01:17:06,569 --> 01:17:08,230
- English, Cheryl, English.
- Mm-hmm.

1461
01:17:08,304 --> 01:17:10,465
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm!

1462
01:17:16,712 --> 01:17:19,340
What are you
doing with that bag?

1463
01:17:23,152 --> 01:17:25,347
# Everything is everything #

1464
01:17:27,957 --> 01:17:30,448
- # It's gonna be #
- # All right #

1465
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,986
# Life can bring us
through many changes #

1466
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:37,089
# It's all right... #

1467
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,465
Are you serious?

1468
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,271
Oh, Tosha.

1469
01:17:49,312 --> 01:17:51,371
Oh my God.

1470
01:17:51,447 --> 01:17:52,937
Welcome home.

1471
01:17:53,015 --> 01:17:54,915
What is this? Harry!

1472
01:17:59,155 --> 01:18:00,588
I can't believe this.

1473
01:18:00,656 --> 01:18:02,089
It's your house.

1474
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:04,183
Oh my God.

1475
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:07,354
Hey! Don't y'all just
stand there.

1476
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:08,624
Come on in this house!

1477
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:11,132
Come on now!
Come on!

1478
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,997
Oh, Harry told us
what happened.

1479
01:18:13,069 --> 01:18:15,196
- We all prayed for you, Mike.
- Thank you.

1480
01:18:15,271 --> 01:18:17,671
Y'all come on in.
I decorated.

1481
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,708
- What?
- No he didn't.

1482
01:18:21,544 --> 01:18:23,136
Baby. Awww.

1483
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:24,679
Come here.
Come on.

1484
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:36,591
Oh my gosh.

1485
01:18:38,294 --> 01:18:40,194
Mom!

1486
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:41,957
Mama, I got my own room!

1487
01:18:42,031 --> 01:18:43,862
I know, baby.

1488
01:18:44,934 --> 01:18:47,926
Oh! Oh, God,
thank you.

1489
01:18:48,003 --> 01:18:51,962
Thank you. How did you
afford to do all of this?

1490
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:55,306
Well, I pitched in
most of the money.

1491
01:18:55,378 --> 01:18:57,869
If you call $45 most of it,

1492
01:18:57,947 --> 01:19:00,177
well then, okay.

1493
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,577
No, we had a fundraiser
at the church.

1494
01:19:03,652 --> 01:19:05,916
- Yeah, and we all pitched in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1495
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:09,321
l... I don't know what to say.

1496
01:19:09,392 --> 01:19:11,223
Money shot.

1497
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:14,023
Here you go. Go up strong.
Always go up strong.

1498
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:23,093
You know, I think
that Harry's a nice man.

1499
01:19:23,172 --> 01:19:24,833
- Yes, he is.
- Mm-hmm.

1500
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:28,365
- Thank you.
- He put up the most money for this house.

1501
01:19:28,444 --> 01:19:30,275
- He sure did.
- He did?

1502
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:31,938
And I think he likes you.

1503
01:19:32,014 --> 01:19:34,608
Mm-hmm.

1504
01:19:34,683 --> 01:19:36,241
- Mama?
- Yeah, baby.

1505
01:19:36,318 --> 01:19:37,979
Where do these
two lovebirds go?

1506
01:19:38,053 --> 01:19:39,987
Come on, I'll show you.

1507
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:46,393
I think...

1508
01:19:46,462 --> 01:19:48,521
he likes her son.

1509
01:19:48,597 --> 01:19:50,087
What are you talking about?

1510
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:51,656
Honey, are you that naive?

1511
01:19:51,734 --> 01:19:54,100
You haven't noticed all that attention
he been giving that boy?

1512
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:55,899
What are you trying to say, Vera?

1513
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:58,235
Oh, not like that.

1514
01:19:58,307 --> 01:20:01,708
He's being so nice to her
because her son

1515
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,210
is a gold mine.

1516
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:05,179
Okay? He's trying to get in

1517
01:20:05,247 --> 01:20:08,011
so he can get that boy to go pro
so he can get some of them perks...

1518
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:11,946
maybe pay off some of them
gambling debts, okay?

1519
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:16,253
Child, please.
This is an investment.

1520
01:20:16,325 --> 01:20:18,054
She better watch out.

1521
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:20,288
- I don't believe none of that.
- Me neither.

1522
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:22,523
Why else would
a man be this nice

1523
01:20:22,598 --> 01:20:24,361
to a woman with three...

1524
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:26,924
count 'em... three kids.

1525
01:20:27,002 --> 01:20:29,835
Well, you know, Vera, there are
some good men in this world.

1526
01:20:29,905 --> 01:20:31,964
And Harry happens
to be one of them.

1527
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:35,135
- That's right.
- Not according to the local bookies.

1528
01:20:35,211 --> 01:20:37,441
Why you think he got
kicked out of the league?

1529
01:20:37,513 --> 01:20:40,573
Don't sit there acting like y'all don't
know this boy got a gambling problem.

1530
01:20:40,649 --> 01:20:43,243
- Don't be acting like you don't know.
- You need to stop

1531
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:45,480
- listening to all that gossip, Vera.
- Please.

1532
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:49,046
- Stop being messy.
- Hush your mouth before she hears you.

1533
01:20:49,124 --> 01:20:51,388
- Yes.
- If you ain't happy,

1534
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,621
you don't want nobody else to be.

1535
01:20:53,696 --> 01:20:56,187
Well, I called it like
I see it and smell it!

1536
01:20:56,265 --> 01:20:58,995
Well, you're always
smelling up some mess.

1537
01:20:59,068 --> 01:21:00,660
That's right.

1538
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:03,000
Do your negative
smelling somewhere else

1539
01:21:03,072 --> 01:21:04,972
'cause you're always
smelling up a mess.

1540
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:11,068
- Cora!
- What?

1541
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:12,875
- Cora!
- Yeah!

1542
01:21:12,948 --> 01:21:15,712
I'm in the kitchen!
I'm in the kitchen!

1543
01:21:15,784 --> 01:21:19,015
Your mama done went crazy!
People just everywhere!

1544
01:21:19,088 --> 01:21:21,579
Mr. Brown, please!

1545
01:21:21,657 --> 01:21:24,148
Cora, you slapped your daddy?
I oughta whup your butt.

1546
01:21:24,226 --> 01:21:25,750
Calm down. What's wrong?

1547
01:21:25,828 --> 01:21:27,261
Just sit down. Sit down.

1548
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:28,660
- Turn the TV on.
- Okay...

1549
01:21:28,731 --> 01:21:30,494
- Turn the TV on!
- What happened on the TV?

1550
01:21:30,566 --> 01:21:32,534
- Get the TV on.
- I'm trying to get it on. Hold on.

1551
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:34,569
- What happened?
- Look!

1552
01:21:34,637 --> 01:21:38,334
A routine traffic stop turned
into one of the largest and most bizarre

1553
01:21:38,407 --> 01:21:40,500
and shocking police pursuits

1554
01:21:40,576 --> 01:21:42,703
that we have ever seen.

1555
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:45,645
This old woman is driving
like she has a lot to lose.

1556
01:21:45,714 --> 01:21:47,682
Who could this be calling
me right now? Hello.

1557
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:50,548
Cora, hey.
How you doing, baby?

1558
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:52,348
Madea, please tell me
that's not you.

1559
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:53,854
Yeah, it's me, honey.

1560
01:21:53,923 --> 01:21:55,151
Yeah.

1561
01:21:55,224 --> 01:21:56,851
Madea, why don't you
just pull over?

1562
01:21:56,926 --> 01:21:58,484
- You can't out...
- I can't pull over.

1563
01:21:58,561 --> 01:22:00,529
- You goin' to jail.
- These police is after me.

1564
01:22:00,596 --> 01:22:02,029
Hold on, I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone.

1565
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:03,826
Mabel, pull over. Just stop.

1566
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:06,459
Oh, Lordy, there's helicopters
and everything now.

1567
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:09,629
- Pull your car over...
- Mabel, you can't outrun

1568
01:22:09,705 --> 01:22:11,696
- the "helichoppers."
- Please, Madea, please!

1569
01:22:11,774 --> 01:22:14,538
- They ain't taking me to jail!
- Like hell they ain't.

1570
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:16,771
...just gonna send me to jail.
I'm going all the way this time.

1571
01:22:16,845 --> 01:22:18,710
I'm going all the way this time.

1572
01:22:18,781 --> 01:22:20,612
Madea, please
pull the car over.

1573
01:22:20,683 --> 01:22:22,947
They ain't gonna get me!
They ain't gonna get me!

1574
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:24,713
I'm gonna be on "Cops."

1575
01:22:24,787 --> 01:22:26,277
No, you can't. Madea, please.

1576
01:22:26,355 --> 01:22:28,220
I love you, honey.
Please just pull over.

1577
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:29,882
I can't pull over, Cora.

1578
01:22:29,959 --> 01:22:32,450
Y'all come down there to DeKalb County,
put $20 on my book.

1579
01:22:32,528 --> 01:22:34,587
I'm running out of gas.
I might have to stop.

1580
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:37,689
If it's any "constipation,"
I love you.

1581
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:40,064
I always have
and I always will.

1582
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:42,126
Madea, please.
I love you, honey, please...

1583
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:44,069
Yeah, I love you too.
Go to hell.

1584
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:48,840
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1585
01:22:49,912 --> 01:22:51,675
- Guess what.
- What?

1586
01:22:51,747 --> 01:22:54,045
Harry took me to his lawyer
to sign a contract with him.

1587
01:22:54,116 --> 01:22:56,482
- He's my manager now.
- He did what?

1588
01:22:56,552 --> 01:22:58,577
Yeah, I sent some
footage to a pro scout.

1589
01:22:58,654 --> 01:23:00,554
I don't know
how the word got out,

1590
01:23:00,623 --> 01:23:04,059
but next thing I know, there's bunch
of agents at the gym pressuring Mike.

1591
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:07,425
You know, I had him sign something...
so they wouldn't take advantage of him.

1592
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:10,988
- Harry knows his stuff, Mama.
- I know a little bit.

1593
01:23:11,066 --> 01:23:13,296
Michael, why don't you
go check on your sisters,

1594
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:16,566
- make sure they wash up?
- Okay.

1595
01:23:18,907 --> 01:23:20,807
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1596
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:24,310
You been awful quiet
the last few days.

1597
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,211
I'm fine.

1598
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:28,112
Harry, can I
ask you something?

1599
01:23:28,183 --> 01:23:30,014
Yeah.

1600
01:23:31,086 --> 01:23:33,919
What's in this for you?

1601
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:36,958
- What are you talking about?
- Why is he so important to you?

1602
01:23:37,026 --> 01:23:39,517
- Hmm?
- l...

1603
01:23:39,595 --> 01:23:41,893
- Hmm.
- Mike's a good kid.

1604
01:23:41,964 --> 01:23:43,829
He's a talented kid.

1605
01:23:45,601 --> 01:23:47,125
What are you
talking about?

1606
01:23:49,138 --> 01:23:51,504
I don't like you spending
all this time with him.

1607
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:55,031
And I don't understand why you're
sending footage to pro scouts.

1608
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:57,669
Trying to... trying to help.

1609
01:23:57,746 --> 01:23:59,407
Why? Why? What for?

1610
01:23:59,481 --> 01:24:00,971
What's in it for you?

1611
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,280
I mean, if he gets
a million-dollar contract,

1612
01:24:03,352 --> 01:24:05,047
you think you
gonna get your cut?

1613
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,553
Is this some
kinda game to you?

1614
01:24:06,622 --> 01:24:08,214
Whoa whoa whoa, hold on.

1615
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:11,316
Where is this coming from?

1616
01:24:11,393 --> 01:24:14,385
Huh? What, have that many men hurt
you that you can't trust one?

1617
01:24:14,463 --> 01:24:16,431
This ain't about me, all right?

1618
01:24:16,498 --> 01:24:18,523
This is about you.

1619
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,625
Now, how much gambling
debt are you in?

1620
01:24:20,703 --> 01:24:22,864
You didn't think
I'd hear about that?

1621
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:33,548
- You think I'm in it for some money?
- Well, are you?

1622
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:35,048
Is that what you think of me?

1623
01:24:35,117 --> 01:24:37,881
Should that be
what I think of you?

1624
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:41,753
- Brenda...
- You're not going to be his manager.

1625
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,719
- Brenda...
- No, just go. Go. Go, please.

1626
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:51,323
I paid all of my gambling debts.
I don't owe anybody anything.

1627
01:24:52,868 --> 01:24:54,802
Get out.

1628
01:25:10,586 --> 01:25:12,611
Oh, hell. I'm running out of gas.

1629
01:25:12,688 --> 01:25:14,553
Pull your car over to the side.

1630
01:25:14,623 --> 01:25:16,955
Cora, here.

1631
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:21,086
Go bail your mama out.
Give her this $20.

1632
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:22,858
What... what is this for?

1633
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:24,626
It's for back child support.

1634
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,361
Back...

1635
01:25:26,435 --> 01:25:28,494
I owe it to ya.

1636
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:30,094
And there it is.

1637
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:32,538
- As fast as it started...
- Oh, they got her.

1638
01:25:32,608 --> 01:25:34,041
But it still has gone down

1639
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:37,044
as one of the longest
police pursuits in history.

1640
01:25:37,112 --> 01:25:39,672
What the hell? They gonna
send "helichoppers"

1641
01:25:39,748 --> 01:25:41,716
and all these police cars
for a little old woman.

1642
01:25:41,784 --> 01:25:44,651
- Get out of the vehicle now.
- Don't shoot.

1643
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,156
I'm getting out of the car.
They gonna lock your ass up.

1644
01:25:50,058 --> 01:25:52,652
I ain't got no weapon.

1645
01:25:52,728 --> 01:25:54,389
I ain't never do nothing wrong.

1646
01:25:54,463 --> 01:25:56,727
- You gonna leave me up here...
- I ain't got no weapon.

1647
01:25:56,799 --> 01:25:58,892
All of this for me, huh?

1648
01:26:00,269 --> 01:26:02,567
What the hell you
got me surrounded for?

1649
01:26:02,638 --> 01:26:05,471
She got a gun!
She... she kidnapped me.

1650
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:08,806
Get out of your
vehicle with your hands up.

1651
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:18,014
Very slowly!
Very slowly!

1652
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:22,846
Put your hands
on the car, ma'am.

1653
01:26:22,925 --> 01:26:24,620
- Hands on the car right now...
- Hold on one minute.

1654
01:26:24,693 --> 01:26:26,957
- Let me tell you something here.
- Put your hands on the car.

1655
01:26:27,029 --> 01:26:29,827
I ain't finna put my hands on the car
'cause my hands is hurtin'.

1656
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,661
- Ma'am, put your hands...
- Who the hell you talkin' to?

1657
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:33,496
- You don't want...
- Put your hands on the car!

1658
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:35,332
- You ain't gonna take me down!
- Settle down, ma'am!

1659
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:36,871
Put your hands on the car now.

1660
01:26:36,939 --> 01:26:38,839
I'm Madea!

1661
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:40,898
There's another charge.

1662
01:26:40,976 --> 01:26:43,137
And another charge.

1663
01:26:43,212 --> 01:26:46,443
- Man down! Man down!
- Another charge. That's six more years.

1664
01:26:46,515 --> 01:26:48,540
Get her off me!

1665
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,210
One, two, three!

1666
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:57,019
You giving me a mammogram!

1667
01:26:57,092 --> 01:26:58,582
Hell, you ain't going...

1668
01:27:00,195 --> 01:27:02,186
Get in the car, ma'am.
Get in the car.

1669
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:05,131
Get in the car.

1670
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,169
- Transport chase suspect. Over.
- Affirmative.

1671
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:14,298
- Stay back, people.
- All right, everybody.

1672
01:27:39,368 --> 01:27:40,960
Just a minute.

1673
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:47,407
- Hi. How may I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Richard Carney.

1674
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:50,172
I'm looking for Brenda
and Michael Brown.

1675
01:27:50,245 --> 01:27:53,703
- What about?
- I'm a sports agent and, well, can we talk?

1676
01:27:53,782 --> 01:27:56,080
Uh, what about?
How'd you get my address?

1677
01:27:56,151 --> 01:27:58,176
Ma, Ma, please.

1678
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:02,915
Come on in.

1679
01:28:04,459 --> 01:28:05,926
Hi.

1680
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:07,518
- How you doing?
- Good.

1681
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:11,229
I sent your son's tape
to two professional teams.

1682
01:28:12,267 --> 01:28:14,098
And they were very impressed.

1683
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:15,602
I've already got two teams

1684
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:18,139
that are interested
in signing him right now.

1685
01:28:18,206 --> 01:28:19,764
- Really?
- Yes.

1686
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:21,706
And I can make a really
good deal for your son.

1687
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:25,636
So what do you want to do?

1688
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:27,341
Hmm?

1689
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:28,906
What do you think?

1690
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:33,879
So what about college?

1691
01:28:33,956 --> 01:28:35,548
We'll have you take
college courses,

1692
01:28:35,624 --> 01:28:37,717
- even help you get a degree.
- Mama...

1693
01:28:44,266 --> 01:28:45,927
Let's do it.

1694
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:47,866
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah?

1695
01:28:47,936 --> 01:28:50,632
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's do it.

1696
01:28:50,706 --> 01:28:52,606
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1697
01:28:52,674 --> 01:28:56,201
Um, he signed a contract
with someone to be his manager.

1698
01:28:56,278 --> 01:28:59,213
Does that person have any legal grounds
to any of his money?

1699
01:28:59,281 --> 01:29:01,044
- You mean Harry Belton?
- Yeah.

1700
01:29:01,116 --> 01:29:04,244
That contract didn't ask for money.
It was more of a guidance thing.

1701
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:05,809
He wasn't even trying to get paid.

1702
01:29:05,887 --> 01:29:08,082
I guess with all of his
knowledge of this business,

1703
01:29:08,156 --> 01:29:10,215
he just didn't want him
to be taken advantage of.

1704
01:29:13,929 --> 01:29:15,988
Listen, Miss Brown,

1705
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:17,725
I'll be in touch in a week, okay?

1706
01:29:17,799 --> 01:29:19,630
And you, young man,

1707
01:29:19,701 --> 01:29:22,431
- you get ready.
- Yes, sir.

1708
01:29:22,504 --> 01:29:26,463
We'd like to say that the Thunderhawks
are very happy to have him onboard.

1709
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:29,510
A million dollars is a lot of money...

1710
01:29:29,578 --> 01:29:32,547
- I'm his daddy.
...are other players going to be jealous...

1711
01:29:32,614 --> 01:29:34,514
Hey, son, how you doing?

1712
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:36,414
Look, son, can I holler
at you a minute?

1713
01:29:36,485 --> 01:29:40,353
- Mama.
- He's still your daddy.

1714
01:29:40,422 --> 01:29:43,084
- What is he to me?
- I just want to say congratulations, boy.

1715
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:45,353
- I'm proud of you. You did it.
- Hey hey hey.

1716
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:48,590
When you had the chance to be in my life,
you didn't want no part of me.

1717
01:29:48,663 --> 01:29:50,824
You should have thought
about all this before.

1718
01:29:50,899 --> 01:29:53,060
Hey, now, come on.
Don't be like that.

1719
01:29:53,135 --> 01:29:54,568
I don't know why you here, man.

1720
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:56,160
That $25 an hour is waiting on you.

1721
01:29:56,238 --> 01:29:57,865
What position is he
going to play?

1722
01:29:57,939 --> 01:30:01,466
Coach, what do you think Mike's
gonna do with all the money?

1723
01:30:01,543 --> 01:30:03,773
Why don't we let Mike
answer that question?

1724
01:30:03,845 --> 01:30:07,076
Mike, what are you gonna
do with all that money?

1725
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:10,374
Make sure my mom and my sisters

1726
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:13,012
are taken care of.

1727
01:30:13,088 --> 01:30:16,649
- And he's gonna finish school.
- And finish school.

1728
01:30:16,725 --> 01:30:18,784
Hey, Mike, what are you
gonna do for your dad?

1729
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:21,328
- Who?
- Isn't that your father?

1730
01:30:21,396 --> 01:30:22,920
Well, that's funny.

1731
01:30:22,998 --> 01:30:25,296
I've... I've seen my father
twice since I was four.

1732
01:30:26,935 --> 01:30:28,425
My mom's been breaking her back

1733
01:30:28,503 --> 01:30:30,971
to make sure my sisters and I

1734
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:32,700
had food on the table.

1735
01:30:32,774 --> 01:30:35,334
We lived in the projects
while he went on

1736
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:38,573
and started his life with someone else
living the good life,

1737
01:30:38,647 --> 01:30:42,242
but somehow he seemed
to make it to my big day.

1738
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:45,809
Why don't I let my dad answer that
for you? Come on, Dad.

1739
01:30:45,887 --> 01:30:47,650
Are you proud of your son?

1740
01:30:47,722 --> 01:30:49,485
What was he like as a kid?

1741
01:30:49,558 --> 01:30:51,492
How were his grades
growing up?

1742
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:54,222
- Tell us about the moves he got from you.
- Favorite game memory?

1743
01:30:54,296 --> 01:30:56,287
Well, l... you know,
that was a long time ago.

1744
01:30:56,364 --> 01:30:59,561
He's always been a good boy.
He's always been real athletic

1745
01:30:59,634 --> 01:31:02,432
and... and he's always
loved his basketball.

1746
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:04,301
How do you feel
about your son's comments?

1747
01:31:06,575 --> 01:31:08,133
Hey, you... you know, it...

1748
01:31:09,744 --> 01:31:11,507
you know what?

1749
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,377
Are you gonna spend
more time with him now?

1750
01:31:13,448 --> 01:31:15,473
That's up to my boy.
That's up to Mike.

1751
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,848
- I hope so.
- With you showing up at this time,

1752
01:31:17,919 --> 01:31:20,649
some folks would consider
that gold digging.

1753
01:31:20,722 --> 01:31:23,020
But hey, this is
all about my son, right?

1754
01:31:23,091 --> 01:31:24,683
This is all about
my boy, all right?

1755
01:31:24,759 --> 01:31:27,023
This is not about me.

1756
01:31:39,107 --> 01:31:40,768
This isn't the way home.

1757
01:31:40,842 --> 01:31:42,400
Yeah, I know.

1758
01:31:43,445 --> 01:31:45,140
What?

1759
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:48,315
Ma, you were wrong about Harry.

1760
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:51,045
Michael, you don't know
nothing about that, okay?

1761
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:53,952
No, that's a good dude, Mama.

1762
01:31:54,022 --> 01:31:55,990
And you need to fix it.

1763
01:31:56,057 --> 01:31:59,220
Well, isn't that
what you would tell me?

1764
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:03,697
Yeah.

1765
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,029
He's in there.

1766
01:32:40,535 --> 01:32:42,025
Hey.

1767
01:32:47,509 --> 01:32:48,999
Hey.

1768
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:54,115
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1769
01:32:54,182 --> 01:32:55,649
Talent, attitude, skill.

1770
01:32:55,717 --> 01:32:58,049
He deserves it.

1771
01:32:58,119 --> 01:33:00,110
Thank you
for all your help.

1772
01:33:03,024 --> 01:33:04,548
It's all good.

1773
01:33:08,163 --> 01:33:10,063
You know, um...

1774
01:33:10,131 --> 01:33:11,894
I can pay you back now

1775
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:14,629
for all you did for us...

1776
01:33:14,703 --> 01:33:16,671
the house, the move,

1777
01:33:16,738 --> 01:33:18,501
everything.

1778
01:33:18,573 --> 01:33:21,838
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

1779
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:24,140
I didn't do all of that
so you could pay me back.

1780
01:33:24,212 --> 01:33:25,804
I'm sorry.

1781
01:33:27,215 --> 01:33:29,877
I'm just so used to being
taken advantage of...

1782
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:32,476
Yeah, that you don't even know
when somebody loves you.

1783
01:33:34,189 --> 01:33:35,713
You love me?

1784
01:33:37,592 --> 01:33:39,059
Yeah.

1785
01:33:41,162 --> 01:33:43,187
Tell Mike I said congratulations.

1786
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:58,005
Hey, what if I told you
I love you too,

1787
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:00,479
but I just got scared for a second,

1788
01:34:00,548 --> 01:34:04,245
but I'd rather be scared and with you

1789
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,085
than not scared and not have you?

1790
01:34:10,025 --> 01:34:12,084
What... why would I scare you?

1791
01:34:17,432 --> 01:34:20,663
Because you're everything
I always wanted in a man.

1792
01:34:22,304 --> 01:34:24,704
Then let me be that for you.

1793
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:14,953
Cora, do you miss
your granddaddy?

1794
01:35:16,624 --> 01:35:18,091
I never met him.

1795
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,457
- You what?
- I never met him.

1796
01:35:20,528 --> 01:35:22,553
Let me introduce you
to your granddaddy.

1797
01:35:24,032 --> 01:35:27,763
- He dead.
- Cora, that man died, but he can still hear.

1798
01:35:27,836 --> 01:35:30,703
Whoo! Don't you know
that angels got ears, Cora?

1799
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:32,296
Come here, Cora.

1800
01:35:32,374 --> 01:35:35,343
You got to meet him.
Look the way he dressed.

1801
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:36,843
Look at Daddy.

1802
01:35:36,911 --> 01:35:39,471
Cora, our daddy was ugly,
but he was our daddy.

1803
01:35:40,815 --> 01:35:42,305
Yes, he was. Cora, look at him.

1804
01:35:42,384 --> 01:35:43,817
This is your granddaddy.

1805
01:35:43,885 --> 01:35:46,149
- Don't touch it.
- That's our granddaddy.

1806
01:35:46,221 --> 01:35:47,654
It's our granddaddy.

1807
01:35:47,722 --> 01:35:49,553
- Cora... look at him, Cora.
- I'm looking at him.

1808
01:35:49,624 --> 01:35:52,058
Look at him!
Look down at him!

1809
01:35:52,127 --> 01:35:54,254
Look at him!

1810
01:35:54,329 --> 01:35:55,557
Look down
at him!

1811
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:58,599
Go up close, Cora.
Cora, look... look... kiss him.

1812
01:35:58,666 --> 01:36:00,725
Kiss your granddaddy.
Kiss him on the forehead.

1813
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:02,030
Huh-uh,
huh-uh, huh-uh!

1814
01:36:02,103 --> 01:36:03,832
Let her alone!

1815
01:36:03,905 --> 01:36:05,770
How strong is your faith?

1816
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,569
You believe he can come back?

1817
01:36:07,642 --> 01:36:09,837
You believe he can
be like Nazareth?

1818
01:36:09,911 --> 01:36:12,038
Put your hand
on his heart, Cora.

1819
01:36:12,113 --> 01:36:13,546
You can beat some life in...

1820
01:36:13,615 --> 01:36:15,845
beat his heart, Cora!
Beat into him, Cora!

1821
01:36:15,917 --> 01:36:17,908
Don't touch my daddy!

1822
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:20,011
Cora, I just wanted
you to have...

1823
01:36:20,088 --> 01:36:21,919
this is your daddy, Cora.

1824
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:24,322
Cora, look at him.
You know who this is?

1825
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:28,192
- My granddaddy?
- # This is your granddaddy #

1826
01:36:28,263 --> 01:36:31,755
# This is your granddaddy #

1827
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:34,427
# This is your granddaddy,
your granddaddy #

1828
01:36:34,502 --> 01:36:37,699
# Your granddaddy... #

1829
01:36:37,772 --> 01:36:39,069
Sing it!

1830
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:41,199
# This is your
granddaddy... #

1831
01:36:41,276 --> 01:36:44,177
# This is your granddaddy #

1832
01:36:44,245 --> 01:36:46,873
# Your granddaddy,
your granddaddy. #

1833
01:36:46,948 --> 01:36:48,813
Sing it!

1834
01:36:48,883 --> 01:36:51,113
This movie's been pretty deep so far,

1835
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:52,676
so let's have a good time.

1836
01:36:53,755 --> 01:36:55,188
Cora, I'm trying...

1837
01:36:55,256 --> 01:36:56,951
It's okay. It's okay.

1838
01:36:57,025 --> 01:36:59,550
Please, you have
to open your eyes.

1839
01:37:00,762 --> 01:37:03,230
Hello. Yeah.

1840
01:37:03,298 --> 01:37:04,788
You mean... I'm driving.

1841
01:37:04,866 --> 01:37:06,390
They tell you you can't be talking

1842
01:37:06,468 --> 01:37:08,333
on your cell phone
while you driving.

1843
01:37:08,403 --> 01:37:11,065
Hey!

1844
01:37:11,139 --> 01:37:13,437
Yeah, I'm gonna pray now.
Thank you.

1845
01:37:13,508 --> 01:37:15,635
Y'all bow your heads.

1846
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:17,439
Bow your heads, I'm praying.

1847
01:37:17,512 --> 01:37:19,309
Heavenly Father,

1848
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:22,372
I ask that You would
put them chickens back in that coop

1849
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:24,077
so she can get eggs...

1850
01:37:24,152 --> 01:37:26,177
...to make her pies
and cakes for the church.

1851
01:37:26,254 --> 01:37:28,814
- I need you to watch the road.
- We thank You... help, Cora, turn.

1852
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:30,824
We thank you, Lord,
that You have made a way

1853
01:37:30,892 --> 01:37:32,587
for her to make cakes for the church.

1854
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,355
Bless them chickens!

1855
01:37:34,429 --> 01:37:35,862
- Yes.
- Amen. Amen.

1856
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:37,022
Amen.

1857
01:37:37,098 --> 01:37:38,998
I promise you I didn't know.

1858
01:37:39,067 --> 01:37:41,365
Anybody feel bereaved?

1859
01:37:41,436 --> 01:37:44,371
Why so many people from
the Bereaved family die?

1860
01:37:44,439 --> 01:37:47,169
- I'm bereaved now.

1861
01:37:47,242 --> 01:37:49,540
peoples are always dying
in the Bereaved family.

1862
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:53,172
Every time you read the paper,

1869
01:38:05,527 --> 01:38:07,893
