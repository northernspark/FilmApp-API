Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,994
I can't support this activity
any longer, Max.

3
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:10,498
Relax, Jack. Only two more days and we
move our whole disposal operation north...

4
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,459
out of your jurisdiction.

5
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:16,713
You promised me those barrels'd
be leakproof for 150 years.

6
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:23,386
A slight miscalculation.
Look, it's this simple.

7
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,850
I have an obligation
to produce paint thinner.

8
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:34,356
You have an obligation to provide
a place to dispose of the waste products.

9
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,026
I'm not afraid of you
any more, Potterdam.

10
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:42,822
If I have to expose the whole operation,
I will. I'll bring us all down.

11
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:46,659
I think you're smarter than that, Jack.

12
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:49,245
You can't pay me enough, Max.

13
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:56,336
Kiss your chances of getting elected
mayor goodbye, Mr. City Councilman.

14
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:59,214
It's bigger than an election, Max.

15
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:18,608
Boss?

16
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:23,196
There's a time and a place
for everything, gentlemen.

17
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:53,643
<i>You have an obligation to provide
a place to dispose of the waste products.</i>

18
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:55,145
I got you.

19
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,900
<i>Good morning. You're listening to the
Poor man on the world-famous KROQ.</i>

20
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:03,736
<i>And you still have time
to call in on open-line,</i>

21
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:07,365
<i>where at 5am, let's face it,
we can talk about absolutely anything.</i>

22
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,119
<i>It's live, it's uncensored,
and I'm not even using the tape delay</i>

23
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,329
<i>because this is primetime radio,</i>

24
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:17,834
<i>the 2 to 6am show
where management sleeps.</i>

25
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,003
I gotta go to work.

26
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:30,138
Could you leave your board?
I may go out later.

27
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:34,058
My surfboard?

28
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:38,521
Yeah. You promised me last night.

29
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:44,944
Yeah, you can use it.

30
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:49,198
<i>No tape delay. Here we are on open-line.
Good morning. You're on the air.</i>

31
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:51,784
- <i>Hi, Poorman.</i>
- <i>Where are you calling from?</i>

32
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,287
- <i>South Bay.</i>
- <i>What can I do for you?</i>

33
00:05:54,412 --> 00:06:00,168
<i>Well, my boyfriend just left me and
I'm really bummed cos I loved him a lot.</i>

34
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,712
<i>Why did your boyfriend leave you?</i>

35
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:06,049
<i>He found me and his best friend
in bed together.</i>

36
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:09,636
<i>What do you expect if he found you
in bed with his best friend?</i>

37
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:12,930
<i>I don't know. Maybe a bit more
understanding, you know.</i>

38
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:16,726
<i>Well, you got a problem
that you're gonna have to work out.</i>

39
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:19,478
<i>But not on my show.</i>

40
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:25,360
I hate politicians.

41
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:38,373
- Yeah.
<i>- Coming to work today, Mr. Taylor?</i>

42
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,584
Yeah, Walt,
I'm flyin' out the door right now.

43
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,681
Let's see if my favorite
little stewardess is up yet.

44
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,352
Lookin' good.

45
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:00,561
Oops!

46
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,647
Busted.

47
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,483
Fly those friendly skies.

48
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:14,951
Now that is the perfect relationship.

49
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,917
Wait a minute. Hello.

50
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:26,963
What are you looking at, pal?

51
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,762
Good morning.

52
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:42,436
Time for that morning cup of hot java.
Coffee for one. Three scoops, please.

53
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,356
Nice selection of wines.

54
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:49,152
Good California Chardonnay,
a bottle of Dom.

55
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:52,238
No market brands in this house.

56
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,407
Only the best.

57
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:03,583
Now for some sliced papaya,
if it's in season.

58
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,837
Shit! Mango. I should have known.

59
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,803
I wish I knew your name.

60
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:43,122
Carl. I thought you were
gonna be a no-show.

61
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,708
Almost. Thanks.

62
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,758
Frost and Luzinski?

63
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:57,637
Yeah.

64
00:08:57,762 --> 00:09:04,310
Hey, I don't know about you, shitheads,
but we're on a time clock. Let's move!

65
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:08,648
Gina walked out on me last night.

66
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:11,901
- Really?
- Yeah. Moved all her stuff out.

67
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:15,404
You've been trying to bale out
of that relationship for a long time.

68
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:18,115
I just didn't expect it to be so sudden.

69
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,042
Paybacks are a bitch, James!

70
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:34,965
- You seen my gloves, amigo?
- In the glove <i>compartimente.</i>

71
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:56,779
- Hey, mister!
- Shut up, you dickhead.

72
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,748
Yes, I'm still here.
Now, about those mailers.

73
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,961
First off, you did the colors wrong,
but I let it pass because I'm a nice person.

74
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:15,714
Now you're telling me, with the
election one week around the corner,

75
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,884
that the mailers are gonna go out late?

76
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:24,849
If you don't get those mailers out
by tomorrow, I'm pulling the account.

77
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,809
Bye-bye.

78
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,102
Jerk.

79
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:40,239
I gotta hide this.

80
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,540
- A ton of things need your signature.
- Can it wait?

81
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:53,127
No, and I have a cassette of a band
we could use for the fundraiser.

82
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,464
Since we're short on time,
you could listen and decide.

83
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,634
I don't have time for that. If you like 'em,
use 'em. I trust your judgment.

84
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,680
That's why I hired you as a campaign
manager. You gotta trust your staff.

85
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,266
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

86
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,603
Listen...

87
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:15,900
- You're doing a hell of a job.
- Thank you, Jack.

88
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,926
- I didn't sleep for shit last night.
- Why not?

89
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:43,510
Gina.

90
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,305
Gina, Gina. Gina!

91
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,100
Let her go, man. Let her go.

92
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:53,103
I have, I have. She is historical.

93
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,778
She couldn't be with
a garbageman the rest of her life.

94
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:05,032
You're not gonna be a garbageman.
Didn't you tell her about our surf shop?

95
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:09,203
I told her. I think she was getting
pressure from her family.

96
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,748
- Her father never liked you.
- What does he know?

97
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:16,377
- Well, life's a bitch, right?
- Ain't that the truth!

98
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:26,470
I tell you, Carl, this is
the last year we throw trash.

99
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:29,098
- You said that last year.
- This year I mean it.

100
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:31,266
You meant it last year.

101
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,689
- Hey, Carl, is this yours?
- No, it ain't my color.

102
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:42,444
It's a bra, James.

103
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,157
Look at this smut.

104
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,751
Well, if it isn't
the South Bay's finest.

105
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:01,088
What happened, Mike?
Did they take away your vroom-vrooms?

106
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,551
You see, this is the kind of scum you're
gonna have to get used to around here.

107
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:08,971
Jeff's new to the force,
so I'm giving him the tour.

108
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:15,060
He's also my new partner, so you're
gonna be seeing a whole lot more of him.

109
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,521
Wonderful.

110
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,732
You're gonna like it here, Jeff.

111
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:23,110
The air's clean, the women are beautiful
and the shifts are short.

112
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:28,782
Most of the folks here in Las Playas
are hard-working, with a future in mind,

113
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:31,160
with the exception of these two clowns.

114
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:35,664
They're part of the
"Don't let this happen to you" crowd.

115
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:39,793
A word of warning,
my garbage-toting friends,

116
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,796
from your friendly
neighborhood peace officer.

117
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:47,050
I've got my eye on you both.
If you're not breaking the law now,

118
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:51,346
the smart money says that
it's only a matter of time before you will.

119
00:13:51,472 --> 00:13:56,643
And you can bet that last dollar that my
ass is gonna be there to make the bust.

120
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,772
- Golf clap?
- Golf clap.

121
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:02,459
"Dear John. I'm sorry
things didn't work out for us."

122
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:05,921
"You're a sweet man,
and I'll always love you."

123
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:07,631
Ah!

124
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,177
You know, this is the kind of shit
that really breaks me up.

125
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,346
- It's an epidemic.
- What is?

126
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:17,766
Just women, relationships, all of it.

127
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:20,394
I never have a problem with it.

128
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,562
- Hi, James.
- Morning, baby.

129
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:27,275
- That's cos you've got no heart.
- What?

130
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,115
You've got no heart. Who was
the last girl you were serious about?

131
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:36,576
Betsy Sabetta.

132
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,831
Betsy Sabetta? That was
in the ninth grade and she had a harelip.

133
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:43,000
- She did not.
- She did too.

134
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,919
- She did not!
- Did too, did too.

135
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:49,297
- What do you know about her, anyway?
- I know she had a harelip.

136
00:15:57,055 --> 00:16:00,267
What an absolutely gorgeous day.

137
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,853
Warm sun, beautiful women.

138
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:07,023
And the air is just right for drinking.

139
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,658
Would you just look at all the activity
that's going on down here, Carl.

140
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:20,370
It's close, man. I can see it.

141
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:22,956
Right here, right on the strand.

142
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:25,667
Carl and James' Surf Shop.

143
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,587
It's gold. It's gold, James.
It's a gold mine.

144
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:33,133
Just think of the garbage business
as a way station on the road to nirvana.

145
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:37,387
Maybe now you're single again, you'll be
able to put more time and energy into it.

146
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:41,558
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on, wait a minute, just a second.

147
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:45,437
I have put a lot of energy
into getting our surf shop together.

148
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:50,025
And we'd be a lot further along
if I didn't have to do the work of two.

149
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:56,531
Pardon me? Let's not forget that I chose
the bank that we went to to get our loan.

150
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:58,825
We didn't even get the loan.

151
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,829
It's not like you researched it. You picked
the name out of the Yellow Pages.

152
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,123
What exactly are...

153
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,542
Good God!

154
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,669
What exactly are you trying to say?

155
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:17,636
What I'm trying to say, James, is that
sometimes you are completely hopeless.

156
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,556
- Really?
- Yes.

157
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,601
- Hey, Carl.
- Yeah.

158
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:29,272
- What exactly did you mean by hopeless?
- I meant exactly what I said.

159
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:31,983
I still don't understand.

160
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:34,277
Well, let's examine the word.

161
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:39,491
Hope less. Less than hopeful.
That's what you are.

162
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:45,705
But am I majorly hopeless
or partially hopeless?

163
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,542
I would say majorly. Why do you ask?

164
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,629
- I'll try to change.
- No, you won't.

165
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,958
I need to talk to you, Leo.

166
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,043
Hi. Nice to see you.

167
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:34,796
I need your help on something, Leo.

168
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:39,426
I know who's responsible for
the toxic dumping off Las Playas,

169
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,845
and I'm kind of involved.

170
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,179
Jesus, Jack.

171
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:46,099
I just never thought
it would go this far.

172
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:49,811
Look, it's all on the tape.
Listen to this.

173
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:04,034
What is this? Some kind of a joke?

174
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,745
This is not the right tape.

175
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,330
She took the wrong tape!

176
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,710
- What are you talking about?
- The wrong tape!

177
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:15,211
Hey, wait a minute.

178
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,187
Come on. Let's do the nasty.

179
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:35,273
- Do we have to?
- Yeah, afraid so.

180
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,528
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

181
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,990
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

182
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:50,830
Yeah, Dalton here. Listen,
Jack Berger was in here earlier today.

183
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:55,001
Claimed he knew who was responsible
for those Las Playas offshore dumpings.

184
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:57,837
Claimed he had some kind
of a tape that could prove it.

185
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:02,509
I don't know. This might be nothing,
but I thought you should know.

186
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:09,349
You did the right thing, Captain. I'm sure
it's nothing, but I appreciate the call.

187
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,518
- <i>Any time.</i>
- Thank you.

188
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,105
A tape.

189
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,234
A goddamn tape.

190
00:20:21,027 --> 00:20:23,279
Shrewd move, Berger.

191
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:53,309
Hey, boys!
Where's your originality, huh?

192
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:00,692
This means war, man.

193
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:03,319
Hey, this is shit. It's shit!

194
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:07,448
Get it off me, Frost! Get it off!
It's shit! It's shit!

195
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:10,368
It's payback time, you little shits!

196
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:13,913
Gentlemen, inside now.

197
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:19,627
- What's up, Walt?
- Nothing too serious today.

198
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:23,756
I got a complaint about banging trash
cans on P Street at 6am this morning.

199
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:26,676
- You boys know anything about this?
- No, sir.

200
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:31,222
Who rolled the bowling ball
down the alley into Avenue H?

201
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:33,141
Can't help you there either.

202
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:35,810
In the two years you have worked here,

203
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:40,064
you have broken every city ordinance
that pertains to this line of work.

204
00:21:40,189 --> 00:21:42,984
Well, you can't say
we haven't been a lot of laughs.

205
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,945
I'm glad you have a sense of humor,
Mr. St James.

206
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,991
Unfortunately, the majority
of the people in this community do not.

207
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:55,246
Now me, personally, I like you boys.

208
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:59,208
Which is why
I'm giving you another chance.

209
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:03,421
Starting tomorrow, you boys
will be riding with a third party.

210
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:05,673
What?

211
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,969
I have decided to send an observer
along with you on your route.

212
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:12,513
A representative of Shoreline.

213
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:15,516
- Who's the observer?
- My brother-in-law.

214
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,147
Consider yourselves on probation.

215
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:25,234
I suggest you be on your best behavior.

216
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:38,206
The nerve of Walt, sending us
on our route with a goddamn baby-sitter.

217
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:40,374
Don't worry about it.

218
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:47,423
What does a... phrenologist
feel and interpret?

219
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:51,385
- The size of Walt's asshole.
- Wrong.

220
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:57,725
No, a phrenologist feels and interprets
the bumps on your head, skull features.

221
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,311
Very good.

222
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:05,107
Who was Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff
during the final days of Watergate?

223
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:07,610
Oprah Winfrey.

224
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:11,197
No, that was... Alexander Haig.

225
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:14,367
That's right.

226
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:19,405
What does gasoline...

227
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:23,793
Jack! Jack!

228
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:27,338
The tape! What did you do with the tape?

229
00:23:29,632 --> 00:23:31,717
Jesus Christ!

230
00:23:39,976 --> 00:23:44,355
- What are you doing?
- I hate shitheads who bully their women.

231
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:46,816
- So what are you gonna do?
- Shoot him.

232
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:49,110
- What?
- It's the principle, James.

233
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:52,363
With a pellet gun? What are you
gonna accomplish using that?

234
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:55,074
It allows me to seriously
aggravate a situation

235
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:58,077
without actually changing
the course of history.

236
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:00,871
It also stings like a bitch.

237
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:08,713
Well, I'm glad that's over.

238
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:16,721
Carl, what are you doing?
Everything's cool now.

239
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:20,182
Mister, it's nothing personal.

240
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:30,985
- Where do you think you got him?
- Butt shot.

241
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,571
He'll never lay a hand on her again.

242
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:44,540
Asshole! I wouldn't have
voted for you anyway.

243
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:47,251
- Stop it! Stop it!
- What?

244
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:51,547
Shoot him in the head,
his head's all over the place.

245
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:18,741
Touchdown! The tape! Touchdown!

246
00:25:18,866 --> 00:25:20,910
Genius.

247
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,880
Man, this guy's really heavy.
I gotta start working out.

248
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:35,674
- You should go to the gym.
- I hate weights.

249
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,552
- You work on your cardiovascular.
- What's that?

250
00:25:38,677 --> 00:25:41,097
- Get on one of those life cycles.
- What's that?

251
00:25:41,222 --> 00:25:43,891
- Stationary bike.
- Yeah? How are they?

252
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:49,271
They're great. They got... cross-country
skiing machines, things where you row.

253
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:52,316
Come on, get him in there.
I wanna go eat.

254
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,611
Come on, come on, come on.

255
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,282
I got it. Start the car.

256
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:02,326
Right, Jack, I have the tape.

257
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:04,286
Jack?

258
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:06,372
Jack?

259
00:26:19,552 --> 00:26:22,805
Touch that again
and I swear to God, I'll kill you.

260
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,974
What'd I do?

261
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:33,774
Let's go a little bit faster, see if
you can put me through the windshield.

262
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,600
Where the hell am I?

263
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,692
Time for work. Boy, oh boy!

264
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:21,071
James, do us both a favor.

265
00:27:22,698 --> 00:27:24,742
Whatever you do,

266
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:29,580
don't give this observer guy
a hard time today.

267
00:27:31,498 --> 00:27:34,418
I figure if we behave ourselves,

268
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:39,465
show him that
we're a couple of good guys,

269
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,301
we'll get him out of our hair
a lot quicker.

270
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:44,928
OK.

271
00:27:48,891 --> 00:27:50,934
For all we know...

272
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:55,773
he could be some crazed combat veteran.

273
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:16,627
You're driving too fast.

274
00:28:20,756 --> 00:28:25,803
So, Louis, you're Walt’s brother-in-law.
That's great. Speaks highly of you.

275
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:28,013
What do you know about anything?

276
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:30,182
Walt’s a nice guy.

277
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:34,436
His sister must be nice too.
I've never met her.

278
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:37,272
When I feel like talking to you,
I will look at you.

279
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:39,441
Gotcha.

280
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,658
You writing stuff about us?
Sorry. Sorry.

281
00:28:50,577 --> 00:28:52,621
This sucks.

282
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,834
What did you say, son?

283
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:59,002
The name is James.

284
00:29:00,754 --> 00:29:04,466
Well, James,
if you expect to keep this job,

285
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:07,970
I suggest you tell me what it was
you were mumbling over there.

286
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:10,139
James.

287
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:13,725
I said this sucks.

288
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:15,894
And, basically, so do you.

289
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:42,462
You little... I'll show you
not to talk to me like that!

290
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:44,631
Hey, hey! Goddammit!

291
00:29:57,144 --> 00:30:00,397
This Louis guy's a total nightmare.

292
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:04,026
He's not playin' around,
let me tell you, James.

293
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:07,821
Yeah, I feel really bad
about that, Carl.

294
00:30:08,697 --> 00:30:11,241
Probably not as bad as I do.

295
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:29,885
- James, promise me something.
- What?

296
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,929
No matter what you do,
do not provoke this guy.

297
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:34,264
- Promise.
- I'm serious.

298
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:36,433
I promise.

299
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:46,735
- How's that nose?
- It's OK.

300
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:51,573
I still owe one
to the intended receiver.

301
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:54,117
You know, man,
you're a total pain in the a...

302
00:30:54,242 --> 00:30:58,038
Now, James, Louis is gonna be with us
for the next couple of weeks.

303
00:30:58,163 --> 00:31:00,123
Accept this as fact.

304
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:04,378
Why don't you guys shake hands
and stop behaving like children?

305
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:16,056
Put it on the back of your neck.

306
00:31:21,395 --> 00:31:26,483
There are several sacred things in
this world that you don't ever mess with.

307
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:29,653
One of them happens to be
another man's fries.

308
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:33,615
Now, you remember that
and you'll live a long and healthy life.

309
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,923
James.

310
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:35,093
- James.
- What?

311
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:37,762
You better get over here
and take a look at this.

312
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,348
What is it, Carl?

313
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:43,727
Just take a look.

314
00:32:52,402 --> 00:32:56,615
- What the hell is this, Carl?
- It's a dead human being, James.

315
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,035
Yeah? What's he doin' on our route?

316
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:09,419
Oh, looky here. Looks like somebody
threw away a perfectly good white boy.

317
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:21,181
And he sure looks
a hell of a lot like that dude.

318
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,393
We're screwed.

319
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,856
What do you mean "we"?
You pulled the trigger, pal.

320
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:32,150
Look, Louis, we gotta talk.

321
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:35,070
You see, Louis,
Carl sort of knows this guy.

322
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:36,780
- So?
- I don't know him at all.

323
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:40,116
- What I'm trying to say is he shot him.
- With a pellet gun.

324
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,577
- But he thought he hit him in the butt.
- I did.

325
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:45,789
You two seem to be
in some serious shit here.

326
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:47,248
I need a drink.

327
00:33:47,374 --> 00:33:50,960
Look, Louis, I know
that I did not kill this man.

328
00:33:51,086 --> 00:33:55,715
This guy was beatin' on his old lady,
so I took upon myself to end the dispute.

329
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,051
- So you shot him?
- With a pellet gun.

330
00:33:58,176 --> 00:34:00,220
So you said.

331
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:04,891
- And you shot him from where?
- From my apartment.

332
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:07,644
So how in the hell did he end up here?

333
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:09,813
Why don't you ask him?

334
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:14,567
- Have some. It'll settle your nerves.
- My nerves don't need settling!

335
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:17,445
What is the maximum sentence for murder?

336
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,533
I did not murder anyone! Jesus Christ,
James, whose side are you on?

337
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:24,744
- I am not taking sides.
- You've already convicted me.

338
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:27,080
I'm on my way to death row.

339
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:28,540
Carl, come on.

340
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:31,042
Let me tell you,
you are in it as much as I am.

341
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:34,045
You were there.
That makes you an accomplice.

342
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,590
Look, you bastard, I never
wanted you to do it. I was against it.

343
00:34:37,715 --> 00:34:41,761
- Try explaining that to the judge.
- I'm not explaining anything to any judge.

344
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:44,848
- This is your ball game, Carl.
- You are an asshole!

345
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:48,268
- You are a trigger-happy idiot!
- I will not rot in prison alone.

346
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:51,646
You're not gonna mess up my life,
you son of a bitch!

347
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:53,064
Hey!

348
00:34:53,189 --> 00:34:55,483
You and your stupid pellet gun!

349
00:34:58,528 --> 00:35:00,655
- Get off of me!
- I'll kill you!

350
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,700
You're a stupid man!
You're a stupid little man!

351
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:06,536
I said enough! I said cut it out!

352
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:10,582
Hey, you! I said knock it off!

353
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:16,171
Now look, unless one of you two guys
took a piece of rope or a piece of wire

354
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:18,923
and strangled this guy,
you're both in the clear.

355
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:21,509
How the hell do you know?

356
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,475
You can tell by the marks on his neck.
Look at that.

357
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:32,145
Pretty sloppy job, too.

358
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,982
Not a great idea to keep him
out in the open like this.

359
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:40,236
I don't like this, Carl.
I don't like this one bit.

360
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:42,780
- I'm goin' to the cops.
- What?

361
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:44,949
Looks like they're comin' to us.

362
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:49,412
I hate cops.

363
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:03,843
Well, well. Another fine day
in the dumps, eh, fellas?

364
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:14,771
Who are your friends?
I've never seen you around here before.

365
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:16,940
Louis here works for the company.

366
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:21,778
He'll be ridin' with us for the next
couple of weeks to police our activities.

367
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:26,366
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir, Officer, sir.

368
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:28,826
- What about you?
- He's...

369
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:31,412
I didn't ask you, garbageman.

370
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,624
I'm asking the punk who looks like
he's had a few too many.

371
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:37,961
What the hell's the matter with him?
He looks friggin' dead.

372
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:45,468
Well, the boy's had a rough night.
He's, you know, a... cousin of James.

373
00:36:45,593 --> 00:36:51,641
He flew in from... Texas. We were
out late showin' him a good time.

374
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:55,728
Wherever he's from, he shouldn't be
out on the street in his condition.

375
00:36:55,853 --> 00:37:00,358
I could haul you in, you know. But for now
I'm just gonna give you a warning.

376
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:04,237
- That's very kind of you, Officer.
- Yeah, it is.

377
00:37:04,362 --> 00:37:08,491
Get him inside that truck and make sure
he stays there until he sobers up.

378
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:11,744
- Do I make myself clear?
- Crystal, sir. Let's go.

379
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:17,208
Not so fast.

380
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:28,511
I've got the whole Las Playas police
department clued into you two bozos.

381
00:37:28,636 --> 00:37:30,680
You may have escaped me this time,

382
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:34,600
and all I can say is
"Relish this moment, gentlemen."

383
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:51,409
This is wrong. This is just wrong, wrong,
wrong! We should have just told them.

384
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:53,661
Told them what?

385
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:55,913
That we found a body in the trash

386
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:59,584
that just happened to be Jack Berger,
the man I shot with a pellet gun?

387
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:04,881
Are you nuts? Those guys are
lookin' for any excuse to put us away.

388
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:10,595
Let's get outta here. We'll stash the body,
get back to work and figure this out later.

389
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,030
Son of a bitch!

390
00:38:29,155 --> 00:38:31,574
I can't believe this. We lost the body.

391
00:38:31,699 --> 00:38:34,035
Hey, relax. We didn't lose the body.

392
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,079
It's in a big yellow can.
How can we miss it?

393
00:38:37,205 --> 00:38:39,415
What do you mean, you've lost the body?

394
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,002
It just kind of fell out
of the back of the car.

395
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:44,378
Well.

396
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:48,132
- Find it! Find it, find it, find it, find it!
- Yes, sir.

397
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:51,010
Your very lives
depend upon it, gentlemen.

398
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:56,015
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- Sir, we did find the tape.

399
00:38:56,557 --> 00:38:58,392
Oh.

400
00:38:59,143 --> 00:39:01,187
Thank God.

401
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:04,398
You're excused.

402
00:39:24,126 --> 00:39:27,672
- Wait a minute. The girl.
- What girl?

403
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:31,259
- The girl we saw Berger fighting with.
- What about her?

404
00:39:31,384 --> 00:39:34,470
Well, maybe she had
something to do with his death.

405
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:38,933
Yeah, so she strangles him, stuffs him in a
barrel and dumps him on the esplanade?

406
00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:41,602
It makes a lot of sense, Carl.

407
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:45,022
You know...

408
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:51,612
That stiff's startin' to get a little gamy.
You guys come up with anything?

409
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:55,241
Carl seems to think that
Berger's girl is somehow involved.

410
00:39:55,366 --> 00:40:00,621
The last time we saw Berger alive was
in that fight across from my apartment.

411
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:03,666
- It's not enough to go on.
- It's a place to start.

412
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:07,586
How about going to the police? What
we should have done in the first place.

413
00:40:07,712 --> 00:40:10,464
Carl's right. It's a place to start.

414
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:17,763
We're not gonna accomplish
a goddamn thing standing around here.

415
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:20,933
So you guys are either
with me or you're not.

416
00:40:58,012 --> 00:41:00,681
I thought you knew
how to rig that thing.

417
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,851
I followed the instructions.

418
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:04,245
Anything good to eat in this place?

419
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,166
- I could order us a pizza.
- Sounds great. Pepperoni, extra cheese.

420
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:24,181
Maybe we should put old Milhous
someplace a little less visible.

421
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:28,143
I need a large pepperoni, extra cheese,

422
00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:33,315
to 828 Esplanade, apartment 405.

423
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,818
Last name, Taylor.

424
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:37,987
Yeah.

425
00:42:39,238 --> 00:42:41,282
OK, what's the total on that?

426
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:04,972
Hey, Carl.

427
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:10,352
Hello.

428
00:43:10,477 --> 00:43:13,981
She hardly looks like
a cold-blooded killer.

429
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:18,610
What now, hotshot?

430
00:43:18,736 --> 00:43:21,155
How about goin' over there
and tellin' her

431
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,409
that we got her boyfriend's
dead body sittin' in our shitter?

432
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:28,245
What are we gonna do?

433
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:33,208
Stand here watching her like
a bunch of long-distance Peeping Toms?

434
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:35,669
No.

435
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:38,297
- I'm goin' over there.
- What?

436
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:40,591
- I'm goin' over there.
- What for?

437
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:44,678
I don't know. Snoop around,
see what I can come up with.

438
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:49,516
Carl, this is not some game. What if
she didn't have anything to do with this?

439
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:54,021
Gee, James, you sound as if
you're really worried about me.

440
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:57,858
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- I'm not gonna get in over my head.

441
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:01,111
Well, that depends on
which head you're talkin' about.

442
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:06,116
Look, we got your back. If anything funny
happens, don't be too shy to scream.

443
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:09,119
OK. Save me a slice.

444
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:17,628
Do you know where
he keeps that gun of his?

445
00:44:48,116 --> 00:44:50,285
What is he doing?

446
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,454
What am I doing?

447
00:45:25,862 --> 00:45:26,697
Uh-oh.

448
00:45:35,497 --> 00:45:37,291
- Don't kill me!
- What?

449
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:39,459
What? I'm sorry.

450
00:45:40,419 --> 00:45:44,006
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I've never been better.

451
00:45:44,798 --> 00:45:47,801
- Do you live here in the...
- I'm sorry if I...

452
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:49,970
You first.

453
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:53,974
- Do you live here in the building?
- Yes, I do live here in the building.

454
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:56,560
For five years I've been
in the building.

455
00:45:56,685 --> 00:45:59,688
That's funny.
I've never seen you here before.

456
00:45:59,813 --> 00:46:02,983
Well, I lead a very... private life.

457
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:05,944
I'm a... a... phrenologist.

458
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:09,156
What exactly does a phrenologist do?

459
00:46:09,281 --> 00:46:14,786
Well, I feel and interpret the size of
Walt’s asshole... I mean, skull features.

460
00:46:17,164 --> 00:46:19,207
Wow.

461
00:46:21,168 --> 00:46:27,132
Not to impose, but if we can go inside and
put some ice on this ankle, it'd be great.

462
00:46:27,257 --> 00:46:29,801
- Inside where?
- Your apartment.

463
00:46:29,926 --> 00:46:31,970
What's the matter with yours?

464
00:46:32,095 --> 00:46:36,725
No, my ice machine is broken,
and yours is right here.

465
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,438
Are you gonna refuse a wounded man
in dire need of medical attention?

466
00:46:43,273 --> 00:46:45,317
- No.
- Thanks.

467
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:50,197
- But I didn't catch your name.
- I'm Ted Blanston, the third.

468
00:46:50,322 --> 00:46:52,449
Susan Wilkins, the first.

469
00:46:52,574 --> 00:46:55,744
He's inside. He's inside her apartment.

470
00:46:56,787 --> 00:46:58,830
Out that light.

471
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:03,960
What the hell's Carl doing?

472
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:07,714
I don't like this, man.
I do not like this.

473
00:47:09,341 --> 00:47:11,635
Asshole!

474
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:16,056
The hell with this.
I'm callin' the police.

475
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:27,818
No cops. I hate cops.

476
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:37,285
I'm sorry, which ankle was it?

477
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:41,832
It's the swollen one.

478
00:47:46,253 --> 00:47:49,339
- I really appreciate this.
- It's no trouble.

479
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:54,010
Are you friendly with the Cottlers?

480
00:47:55,345 --> 00:47:57,514
- I think...
- Second floor?

481
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:00,350
- Ron and Ann?
- Oh, sure.

482
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:03,270
Well, I figured,
since you're both doctors.

483
00:48:03,395 --> 00:48:05,730
Right. We're all doctors.

484
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:09,651
Where do you practice?

485
00:48:09,776 --> 00:48:14,406
I got a small office down
in the medical district and...

486
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:17,242
You know, I could really use a drink.

487
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,620
- Just one.
- Me too.

488
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:23,290
Thanks.

489
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,798
- Sorry.
- I could have brought it to you.

490
00:49:18,136 --> 00:49:20,013
Thank you.

491
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,523
It's for the pain.

492
00:49:31,524 --> 00:49:36,404
I rarely touch the stuff.
Can I have another one?

493
00:49:37,155 --> 00:49:41,910
I don't believe this.
They're doin' shots, for Christ's sake.

494
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:46,956
I can't believe
I've never met you before.

495
00:49:50,168 --> 00:49:53,421
I thought I knew everyone
who lived in this building.

496
00:49:53,546 --> 00:49:56,716
Well, as I said,
I lead a very private life.

497
00:49:56,841 --> 00:49:58,968
Very private life. Yeah.

498
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,141
You know, you're a very beautiful woman.

499
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:09,646
No, I mean that. I've always thought so.

500
00:50:09,771 --> 00:50:11,606
What do you mean, always?

501
00:50:11,731 --> 00:50:15,944
What I meant was that
you've probably always been beautiful

502
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:19,864
and it's a shame that
I'm just now discovering this.

503
00:50:20,824 --> 00:50:21,616
Oh.

504
00:50:21,741 --> 00:50:24,494
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

505
00:50:25,954 --> 00:50:30,542
Well, you did.
You wanna switch to champagne?

506
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:34,629
Sure, if the Dom Perignon is chilled,
that'd be perfect.

507
00:50:34,754 --> 00:50:37,215
How did you know I had Dom?

508
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:43,429
How did I know you had Dom?
Doesn't everybody?

509
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:02,240
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom, Louis.

510
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:09,998
Jesus! Carl spends the evening
with a beautiful woman

511
00:51:10,123 --> 00:51:13,543
and I'm stuck here
with a lunatic and a corpse.

512
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,006
I don't believe this guy.

513
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,200
I can't do this with you starin' at me.

514
00:51:52,707 --> 00:51:55,376
- Who is it?
- Pedro's Pizza and Pancakes.

515
00:51:56,252 --> 00:51:58,296
Yeah!

516
00:52:00,882 --> 00:52:02,717
OK.

517
00:52:02,842 --> 00:52:05,720
- Large pepperoni, extra cheese.
- That's us.

518
00:52:05,845 --> 00:52:08,723
- How much?
- Eight bucks.

519
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,477
OK. One, two,

520
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:14,854
three, four...

521
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,984
- What's going on here?
- Mind your own business.

522
00:52:20,109 --> 00:52:22,070
OK. Thank you, sir.

523
00:52:22,195 --> 00:52:24,489
You've seen too much.

524
00:52:31,746 --> 00:52:34,665
- What the hell are you doing?
- He saw you with the body.

525
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,877
- He could start trouble.
- So you kidnap him? Good solution.

526
00:52:38,002 --> 00:52:41,339
Here, take the money.
I won't say anything to anybody!

527
00:52:41,464 --> 00:52:43,299
You bet you won't!

528
00:52:44,467 --> 00:52:46,511
What the hell?

529
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:53,267
Extra cheese?

530
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:57,939
- You're a madman.
- He was provoking me.

531
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:01,526
This situation has definitely
gotten way out of hand.

532
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:04,320
Get back to that window
and keep Carl covered.

533
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:08,658
- What the hell do we do with him?
- We need some rope.

534
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:15,414
Are you gonna get this or what?

535
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,709
Hello?

536
00:53:18,835 --> 00:53:22,713
First, you lose the body,

537
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:25,842
and then you deliver me the wrong tape.

538
00:53:25,967 --> 00:53:29,095
Now, I don't think that
either of you personally

539
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,431
set out to destroy my company.

540
00:53:32,557 --> 00:53:38,228
But I sent you out on a simple task.
And, simply put, you loused it up.

541
00:53:39,313 --> 00:53:41,941
Now, apparently,

542
00:53:42,066 --> 00:53:46,946
Berger had a special relationship
with his campaign manager,

543
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:51,617
a Susan Wilkins, 825 Esplanade.

544
00:53:51,742 --> 00:53:54,871
That's where we iced Berger, chief.
I know where that is.

545
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:57,498
Well...

546
00:53:57,623 --> 00:54:02,003
Did it ever occur to you two idiots
that she might have the cassette?

547
00:54:05,214 --> 00:54:07,592
I think he wants us
to kill some more people.

548
00:54:07,717 --> 00:54:09,218
OK.

549
00:54:09,844 --> 00:54:14,557
If I had my 16,
I could pick her off so easily.

550
00:54:20,855 --> 00:54:23,566
This is good. Did you make it?

551
00:54:23,691 --> 00:54:28,696
<i>...reporting from Hanoi Hilton.
Yankee dogs, you might as well give up.</i>

552
00:54:28,821 --> 00:54:31,782
<i>The war is lost. Jane Fonda was right.</i>

553
00:54:33,993 --> 00:54:36,621
Are you hungry? Would you like some?

554
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:39,957
- Don't give him any, James.
- Why not? He might be hungry.

555
00:54:40,082 --> 00:54:44,545
He's a prisoner,
and he should be treated accordingly.

556
00:54:45,671 --> 00:54:48,049
Have you completely lost your mind?

557
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:51,260
We're not soldiers and he's not
the enemy. He's a pizza man.

558
00:54:51,385 --> 00:54:53,429
Back in Phu Bai,

559
00:54:54,555 --> 00:54:57,933
he would have been killed
the second he knocked on that door.

560
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:02,021
I would've snapped his neck like a twig.
He never would've seen it coming.

561
00:55:02,146 --> 00:55:06,484
- Louis, Louis, calm down.
- The commie bastard gets no food!

562
00:55:08,444 --> 00:55:10,161
Yeah.

563
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:13,699
Yes, indeed.

564
00:55:13,824 --> 00:55:16,160
That is deep.

565
00:55:16,285 --> 00:55:18,329
That is definitely deep.

566
00:55:19,622 --> 00:55:21,666
Yes.

567
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:25,127
Hm.

568
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:27,296
That's an interesting one.

569
00:55:28,422 --> 00:55:30,466
So is that one.

570
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,721
You were born through Caesarean, no?

571
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:39,934
- No.
- It's not an exact science, of course.

572
00:55:40,059 --> 00:55:42,520
Apparently not.

573
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,942
Mangoes. You love mangoes.

574
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:53,489
- How did you know that?
- Well, it's all here in the contours.

575
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:56,492
Yeah.

576
00:55:58,327 --> 00:56:00,871
So, that's phrenology.

577
00:56:00,996 --> 00:56:03,207
It's fascinating, no?

578
00:56:03,332 --> 00:56:05,584
No. Weird.

579
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:09,839
You know what?
First, let's take this off.

580
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:13,884
And let's do something.

581
00:56:14,009 --> 00:56:19,515
- We are doing something.
- Let's get out of here and do something.

582
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,935
- Like what?
- I don't know, but it'll be fun.

583
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,063
Why this sudden burst of energy?
My ankle's killing me.

584
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:28,232
Come on.

585
00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:32,153
- You want me to get this?
- Oh.

586
00:56:39,368 --> 00:56:41,537
Do you always look in people's trash?

587
00:56:41,662 --> 00:56:44,582
Well, sometimes it's the best way
to get to know 'em.

588
00:56:44,707 --> 00:56:50,004
No, no, no. I wanna report
a murder and a kidnapping.

589
00:56:50,129 --> 00:56:52,381
- <i>Murder and a kidnapping.</i>
- That's right.

590
00:56:52,506 --> 00:56:55,759
- <i>Did they take the body?</i>
- No, no, no. I have the body.

591
00:56:55,885 --> 00:56:58,512
- <i>Did you kill the victim?</i>
- No, I didn't kill him.

592
00:56:58,637 --> 00:57:02,266
- <i>Have you been kidnapped?</i>
- I'm not the one who's been kidnapped.

593
00:57:02,391 --> 00:57:05,936
- I know this sounds strange...
- <i>I don't think we can help you, sir.</i>

594
00:57:06,061 --> 00:57:10,024
Well, fuck me! Isn't that what the police
are supposed to do... help people?

595
00:57:10,149 --> 00:57:12,359
I am telling you...

596
00:57:14,737 --> 00:57:17,198
They're leaving. Let's go.

597
00:57:19,158 --> 00:57:20,618
Dammit!

598
00:57:24,204 --> 00:57:26,457
Let's move it! Come on!

599
00:57:26,582 --> 00:57:31,128
The pizza clown goes with us.
Get him on his feet. I'll get Tricky Dick.

600
00:57:36,717 --> 00:57:40,137
I want you to know, James,
this is all going on my report.

601
00:57:40,262 --> 00:57:43,557
That's great, Louis.
Just make sure you spell my name right.

602
00:57:43,682 --> 00:57:45,976
Don't cross me, James.

603
00:57:51,857 --> 00:57:56,070
All right, let's whack this broad
and get the tape.

604
00:57:58,656 --> 00:58:01,367
Jesus Christ. That's Berger.

605
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:04,912
What the hell?

606
00:58:14,713 --> 00:58:16,757
Get back here, you goof.

607
00:58:17,925 --> 00:58:21,178
- Who's the kid in the clown suit?
- I don't know.

608
00:58:21,303 --> 00:58:25,224
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, Christ!

609
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:31,814
Those bastards are gonna pay.

610
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:33,982
Oh, yeah. They're payin'.

611
00:58:37,444 --> 00:58:39,113
Yo!

612
00:58:40,531 --> 00:58:43,534
There's the broad. There goes the broad.

613
00:58:48,038 --> 00:58:50,582
Come on, come on, come on, you moron.

614
00:59:01,969 --> 00:59:04,138
Are we late for something?

615
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:10,936
- Faster, James, faster.
- I got it to the floor, Louis.

616
00:59:18,694 --> 00:59:22,531
- Who are those guys?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?

617
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:27,953
And where do these guys
get off, takin' our body?

618
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:35,002
Come on, we're losing 'em.

619
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:49,141
Oh, Christ.

620
00:59:50,184 --> 00:59:52,769
- Oh, shit.
- I've almost been waiting for this.

621
00:59:52,895 --> 00:59:56,398
Now you see this here?
This complicates things.

622
00:59:56,523 --> 00:59:58,942
I just don't like killing cops too much.

623
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:02,362
Forget about the body.
They're the ones drivin' around with it.

624
01:00:02,487 --> 01:00:06,909
I say we stay with the girl.
Potterdam says she might have the tape.

625
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:10,412
Biff, help me, all right.
Who just died and made you king?

626
01:00:10,537 --> 01:00:13,790
Hey, Mario, how about this?
Your mother did.

627
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:17,711
Don't you ever say anything,
ever, about my mother.

628
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:20,589
Your mother did, your mother did. Mario!

629
01:00:22,674 --> 01:00:25,636
- How do we handle this?
- Just pull over.

630
01:00:26,762 --> 01:00:29,640
OK, everybody. Act natural.

631
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:54,373
Well, well, well. Look who we got here.

632
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:59,002
I am in no mood
for this right now, Mike.

633
01:00:59,127 --> 01:01:02,214
Just write up the ticket
so we can all get on with our lives.

634
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:05,550
Well, I might not be able
to let you off so easy there, Jimbo.

635
01:01:05,676 --> 01:01:10,097
See, you were doing 65 in a 35,
and you ran a red light.

636
01:01:10,681 --> 01:01:14,059
That's reckless driving
as far as I'm concerned.

637
01:01:14,184 --> 01:01:16,853
Who else you got
in there with you, Jimbo?

638
01:01:20,273 --> 01:01:23,276
What the hell is going on in here?

639
01:01:24,653 --> 01:01:27,614
You're... you're never
gonna believe this, Mike.

640
01:01:28,073 --> 01:01:30,867
I... we, uh...

641
01:01:33,245 --> 01:01:37,207
I'm totally floundering.
I can't even come up with a good lie.

642
01:01:37,332 --> 01:01:39,751
What'd I tell you, James?

643
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:44,506
I knew you were crooked and I knew
I'd catch up to you sooner or later.

644
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:47,759
Everybody out of the vehicle right now.

645
01:01:47,884 --> 01:01:49,886
- Don't do it!
- Don't shoot!

646
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:53,849
- He's got a gun.
- Don't shoot! Please, don't shoot!

647
01:01:53,974 --> 01:01:57,018
Yeah, cop. I know you, man.

648
01:01:57,144 --> 01:02:01,356
I know what you're thinking. "We got us
another crazy nigger here with a gun."

649
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:06,111
Well, let me tell you, human life means
very little to me at this point in time.

650
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:11,366
You see, I thrive on misery.
In the jungle, misery's all you got.

651
01:02:11,491 --> 01:02:15,328
But things are different back here
in the world, or so they seem.

652
01:02:15,454 --> 01:02:18,623
Nobody wants to talk about
pain and suffering.

653
01:02:18,749 --> 01:02:23,003
Everybody wants
everything to be nice and civil.

654
01:02:23,128 --> 01:02:28,800
Well, OK, then. Let's be nice.
Let's be civil.

655
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:34,389
Drop those guns before I pull this trigger
and change the way you feel about me.

656
01:02:42,606 --> 01:02:48,236
Will the officer to the rear of the truck
kindly drop his revolver as well?

657
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:57,329
You know, you cops must really think
I'm as dumb as you look.

658
01:02:57,454 --> 01:03:01,500
Now, don't you know that
when a flashlight hits the cement,

659
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:05,212
it makes a completely
different sound than a revolver?

660
01:03:05,337 --> 01:03:08,089
Let's be good boys,
and do exactly as I say.

661
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:19,392
OK, now, I want Mr. Sneaky Man to come
around and join his partner, Mr. Bonehead.

662
01:03:29,778 --> 01:03:32,113
Sorry, guys.

663
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:38,954
You will swing for this, James.
I shit you not!

664
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:47,170
I don't know, boys, but they look
pretty goddamn sweet to me.

665
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:50,048
What do you think?

666
01:04:07,691 --> 01:04:09,859
What do you think?

667
01:04:16,908 --> 01:04:19,244
How you doing?

668
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:21,705
I'm OK.

669
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:25,583
I think my body's gone into shock
from all the alcohol.

670
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:27,752
I'd like to sit down, actually.

671
01:04:58,116 --> 01:05:00,160
What was that for?

672
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,954
You didn't like it.

673
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,373
No, I liked it... a lot.

674
01:05:05,498 --> 01:05:07,542
Then shut up.

675
01:05:31,483 --> 01:05:35,320
It feels like we're drivin' in circles.
Carl could be anywhere.

676
01:05:55,673 --> 01:05:57,717
You want some?

677
01:05:58,593 --> 01:06:02,514
Promise you're not gonna scream
and cry if I take that gag off?

678
01:06:03,515 --> 01:06:07,519
Now, if you're lyin',
Louis'll have to bash you.

679
01:06:07,644 --> 01:06:09,687
You do understand, don't you?

680
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:16,945
Thank you. Thank you.

681
01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:22,700
- It needs sugar.
- What?

682
01:06:22,825 --> 01:06:24,869
Nothing.

683
01:06:25,578 --> 01:06:27,622
It's not lookin' too good, is it?

684
01:06:29,082 --> 01:06:32,168
- You givin' up?
- I never give up.

685
01:06:33,002 --> 01:06:35,463
I never have. Never once, James.

686
01:06:37,757 --> 01:06:41,010
I'm gonna take us back
along the esplanade.

687
01:06:41,135 --> 01:06:45,682
- Feels like a long shot to me.
- At this point, everything's a long shot.

688
01:06:46,474 --> 01:06:49,227
I can't see anything.
Frost, gimme some light.

689
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:52,814
This is just a little uncool, Luzinski.

690
01:06:52,939 --> 01:06:56,651
Our brouhaha is with Carl,
not with the chick.

691
01:06:56,776 --> 01:07:00,029
I'm just makin' a simple adjustment...
nothing major.

692
01:07:00,154 --> 01:07:04,200
Shake 'em up a little bit.
Now, can I have some light, please?

693
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:06,911
Thank you.

694
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:09,706
- Come on, come on. Hurry up.
- Oh, yeah.

695
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:17,005
Now let's find James, and teach
that simple bastard a lesson too.

696
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:28,391
Hiya, kids. Are we having fun?

697
01:07:28,516 --> 01:07:31,144
- Ted, what's happening?
- Who the hell are you?

698
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:34,063
Hey, shut up, you!

699
01:07:34,188 --> 01:07:36,274
What the hell is that?

700
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:38,317
- It's a Taser.
- A what?

701
01:07:38,443 --> 01:07:41,404
A Taser. 65,000 volts of electricity.

702
01:07:41,529 --> 01:07:46,576
It completely incapacitates the victim
without killing him. I got it on sale.

703
01:07:46,701 --> 01:07:48,619
Let's move it. Let's go.

704
01:07:48,745 --> 01:07:50,788
Put your hands up.

705
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:54,876
Ted, you should do something.

706
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:58,171
If you come up with any ideas,
please let me know.

707
01:07:58,296 --> 01:08:00,631
We have the right to know
what's going on.

708
01:08:00,757 --> 01:08:04,677
Hey, put a cork in it, sister.
You have no more rights.

709
01:08:04,802 --> 01:08:07,555
And you, buying a goddamn laser gun.

710
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,640
- Taser.
- Whatever.

711
01:08:09,766 --> 01:08:13,853
- You've always gotta be so different.
- I'm in no mood. Just lay off.

712
01:08:13,978 --> 01:08:17,523
- No, you gotta be creative.
- I said lay off.

713
01:08:17,648 --> 01:08:20,482
When I say "now", start running.

714
01:08:23,321 --> 01:08:26,866
You're an amazing man.
You know shit about absolutely nothing.

715
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:29,535
Now I've just heard everything.

716
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,370
Hold it, honey.

717
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:34,999
You listen to me, you Italian
son of a bitch, and you listen good.

718
01:08:35,124 --> 01:08:38,669
The day you tell me I don't know shit
and I let you get away with it

719
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:42,799
- is the day that that ocean freezes over.
- That's it. You're over.

720
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,304
Now!

721
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:01,442
- That's my car!
- Looks pretty undriveable. Come on!

722
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:09,325
Come on, let's go!

723
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:14,247
Ted!

724
01:09:15,122 --> 01:09:19,544
- Ted, what the hell's going on?
- I left out a couple of things about myself.

725
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:23,589
- I'm waiting, you son of a bitch.
- First, my name isn't Ted. It's Carl.

726
01:09:23,714 --> 01:09:26,384
From now on when you yell for me
in a panic, yell Carl.

727
01:09:26,509 --> 01:09:28,135
There's more?

728
01:09:28,261 --> 01:09:31,597
Last night you and Jack Berger
had a fight in your apartment.

729
01:09:31,722 --> 01:09:35,101
How the hell could you
have possibly known that?

730
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:39,021
Look, Susan,
I don't live in your building.

731
01:09:39,146 --> 01:09:42,775
I am a garbageman.
I live across the street from you.

732
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,528
I have been watching you
every day for six weeks.

733
01:09:45,653 --> 01:09:49,156
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.
You have been spying on me?

734
01:09:49,282 --> 01:09:52,535
- I don't really consider it spying.
- What do you consider it?

735
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,830
Let me finish! You and Jack
had a fight, you left angry.

736
01:09:55,955 --> 01:09:58,708
The next morning
I found Berger's body in the trash.

737
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,252
- Jack's body?
- Somebody killed him, Susan.

738
01:10:01,377 --> 01:10:04,005
- For a while I thought it was you.
- Jack is not dead.

739
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,050
- Jack was at my apartment last night.
- Trust me, Jack is dead.

740
01:10:08,175 --> 01:10:11,220
Jack came over because
there was some mix-up with a tape

741
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:15,474
and I went down to my car to get
the right tape and... The tape, the tape.

742
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:19,562
This is what had Jack so worked up.
We gotta get this to the police.

743
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:23,190
- What the hell was that for?
- For lying to me. I hate liars!

744
01:10:24,984 --> 01:10:26,569
Hates liars?

745
01:10:29,113 --> 01:10:31,574
That's for spying on me!

746
01:10:34,577 --> 01:10:35,995
Come on!

747
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,133
What happened?

748
01:10:49,258 --> 01:10:52,553
It was something.
You got struck by lightning.

749
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:57,183
- Really?
- A freak storm.

750
01:11:05,149 --> 01:11:07,193
- Police!
- Thank God.

751
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,952
- Police!
- Hello!

752
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:19,121
Over here, by the playground.

753
01:11:31,634 --> 01:11:32,551
Ew.

754
01:11:44,021 --> 01:11:45,523
Sorry, guys.

755
01:11:45,648 --> 01:11:50,361
Wait! It's not what it looks like.
Please, give us a hand.

756
01:11:50,486 --> 01:11:53,405
No, I'm really not into it, but thanks.

757
01:11:53,531 --> 01:11:58,494
Carl! Come on, Carl. Everything
I ever said about you, just kidding.

758
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:00,663
He was.

759
01:12:02,081 --> 01:12:06,961
You're not really gonna leave us here,
are you? That would be...

760
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,432
- Come on, come on, already!
- About a thousand keys here.

761
01:12:23,978 --> 01:12:26,188
- Try this one.
- I'm trying.

762
01:12:34,446 --> 01:12:35,781
Hey, hey, hey!

763
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:39,952
- I got it!
- Look out.

764
01:12:47,626 --> 01:12:49,670
It's my turn, asshole!

765
01:12:50,879 --> 01:12:52,756
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

766
01:12:52,881 --> 01:12:54,675
- I'm crashing!
- Down!

767
01:13:13,652 --> 01:13:15,696
I'm back.

768
01:13:16,322 --> 01:13:18,365
Let's go, honey.

769
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,330
Chief, we got 'em. We found 'em.

770
01:13:30,794 --> 01:13:35,257
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Maxwell Potterdam the third.

771
01:13:35,382 --> 01:13:38,969
Maybe you've heard of me. <i>California</i>
magazine just did a piece on me.

772
01:13:39,094 --> 01:13:42,264
With the exception of being
misquoted several times,

773
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:45,642
I thought it was a pretty good article.

774
01:13:45,768 --> 01:13:50,314
Anyway, all that is... unimportant.

775
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:55,861
This... is what's important.

776
01:13:55,986 --> 01:13:58,822
Let's put these folks in the car

777
01:13:58,947 --> 01:14:02,659
and go someplace a little more noisy.

778
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,164
Come on, move it.

779
01:14:12,419 --> 01:14:14,171
Hey.

780
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:17,049
That's them. Getting into that limo.

781
01:14:19,593 --> 01:14:23,764
- What the hell's goin' on?
- I don't know, but we're gonna find out.

782
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:57,589
I knew this was gonna get heavy.

783
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:05,848
A lot of good this thing is gonna do us.

784
01:15:07,432 --> 01:15:12,938
A pellet gun? You've been holding me
hostage all night with an air rifle?

785
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:15,566
- Shut up.
- This is too much.

786
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:18,735
We gotta find a way in there.

787
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:22,781
I... I got a plan.

788
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:32,791
That oughta do them.

789
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:36,628
I would love to see
those bastards try and top this.

790
01:15:36,753 --> 01:15:42,175
I would pay a million pesos to see their
faces when they try to stop this baby.

791
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:45,888
Hey, pal, the next time
we see Carl and James,

792
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:49,725
it's gonna be Walt
handing them their walking papers.

793
01:15:52,436 --> 01:15:55,522
Somebody's coming.

794
01:15:57,649 --> 01:15:59,693
Come on!

795
01:16:01,236 --> 01:16:04,448
- Come on, move it. Get up there.
- OK, I'm going.

796
01:16:33,935 --> 01:16:36,980
We do live in extraordinary times.

797
01:16:37,105 --> 01:16:40,317
The lengths one has to go
to get the job done.

798
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:44,029
You're destroying the environment
and you don't even care.

799
01:16:44,154 --> 01:16:47,699
How do you do it?
How do you live with yourself?

800
01:16:47,824 --> 01:16:49,868
Gentlemen.

801
01:16:50,952 --> 01:16:53,372
Although I'd prefer to dump you

802
01:16:53,497 --> 01:16:57,125
along with the rest of this waste
at the bottom of the Pacific,

803
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:01,630
recent disruptions in our operation
have created a problem,

804
01:17:01,755 --> 01:17:07,552
and now the Las Playas landfill
will become your final resting place.

805
01:17:07,677 --> 01:17:10,389
- Buried alive?
- Not to worry.

806
01:17:10,514 --> 01:17:14,810
You'll probably run out of oxygen
before we reach the dump site.

807
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,563
Seal 'em up.

808
01:17:18,688 --> 01:17:20,440
No!

809
01:17:31,368 --> 01:17:33,829
Hold on, everyone!

810
01:17:39,751 --> 01:17:40,752
Hey!

811
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:47,676
Something's wrong. We're not stopping.

812
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:50,262
- What?
- We're not stopping!

813
01:18:00,063 --> 01:18:03,150
- What the hell was that?
- Move your ass and find out.

814
01:18:03,275 --> 01:18:07,154
No, you two stay.
I want those barrels sealed. You two.

815
01:18:15,954 --> 01:18:18,540
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

816
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:20,709
Oh, shit.

817
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:25,338
Get off of me.

818
01:18:54,993 --> 01:18:57,037
Come on, let's go.

819
01:18:57,162 --> 01:19:00,332
No, no, no. No, no, no.

820
01:19:00,457 --> 01:19:05,795
I am not some kind of comic-book
superhero. I'm a pizza man.

821
01:19:06,504 --> 01:19:09,591
- Stay here and keep an eye on him.
- Yeah, right.

822
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:34,324
I want the trucks moving immediately.

823
01:19:34,449 --> 01:19:38,161
I want every goddamn drop of waste
dumped before the sun rises.

824
01:19:38,286 --> 01:19:40,330
OK, Mr. Potterdam.

825
01:20:34,843 --> 01:20:37,429
Go this way!

826
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:45,061
Jesus!

827
01:20:47,355 --> 01:20:48,606
Holy shit!

828
01:21:07,959 --> 01:21:11,087
All right, I'll pick it up
on my way back.

829
01:21:14,299 --> 01:21:17,719
- Hi, Carl.
- Hi, James. How are you?

830
01:21:18,553 --> 01:21:20,597
Never better.

831
01:21:21,848 --> 01:21:23,892
Susan! Come on.

832
01:21:39,490 --> 01:21:41,743
Come on! We can't lose 'em!

833
01:21:44,621 --> 01:21:47,874
- We're not gonna make it.
- We'll make it.

834
01:22:02,013 --> 01:22:04,057
South Bay Security. Freeze!

835
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:16,569
Rent-a-cops. I hate rent-a-cops too.

836
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,293
Carl! What the hell are we doing?

837
01:22:32,418 --> 01:22:34,629
I think I love this girl.

838
01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:37,131
Really? How do you know?

839
01:22:37,256 --> 01:22:40,134
She let me feel the bumps on her head.

840
01:22:40,259 --> 01:22:42,303
Whoa!

841
01:22:43,554 --> 01:22:47,392
- It looks like the bolt broke!
- No shit!

842
01:22:53,147 --> 01:22:55,483
- Hang on.
- OK.

843
01:22:58,027 --> 01:23:00,113
Trees! Trees!

844
01:23:01,656 --> 01:23:03,658
- Carl!
- What?

845
01:23:03,783 --> 01:23:06,536
- How you doin' over there?
- Piece of cake.

846
01:23:16,587 --> 01:23:18,631
You need help.

847
01:23:34,605 --> 01:23:35,606
Carl!

848
01:23:42,196 --> 01:23:44,240
James!

849
01:23:45,908 --> 01:23:48,286
Hey, Carl!

850
01:23:48,411 --> 01:23:50,538
I think I got a problem over here.

851
01:23:50,663 --> 01:23:53,833
All right, let me think of something.

852
01:23:56,627 --> 01:24:00,631
Hey, James, I didn't think
of anything yet.

853
01:24:05,803 --> 01:24:10,141
Hey, Carl! I definitely
got a problem over here!

854
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:14,645
I'm coming.

855
01:25:05,196 --> 01:25:07,240
Mr. Potterdam?

856
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,898
We're lookin' pretty outnumbered here.

857
01:25:43,025 --> 01:25:45,695
I got an idea. Follow me.

858
01:26:00,543 --> 01:26:04,463
- What the hell are you doing?
- Protecting the environment.

859
01:26:10,886 --> 01:26:12,930
- Freeze.
- What are you...

860
01:26:18,811 --> 01:26:20,980
Everybody freeze or I blow his head off!

861
01:26:21,105 --> 01:26:22,857
- He'll do it.
- I'm not kiddin'.

862
01:26:22,982 --> 01:26:24,608
- Don't push him.
- I mean it.

863
01:26:24,734 --> 01:26:25,860
His whole head.

864
01:26:25,985 --> 01:26:29,029
You two with the weapons,
over the side. Do it now!

865
01:26:38,164 --> 01:26:40,499
Yeah, man, I know you.

866
01:26:40,624 --> 01:26:45,296
I know what you're thinking. "We got us
another crazy white boy with a gun."

867
01:26:45,421 --> 01:26:50,559
Well, let me tell you, human life means
very little to me at this point in time.

868
01:27:00,227 --> 01:27:02,897
Relax, James, the cops are here.

869
01:27:03,022 --> 01:27:07,735
This is the police.
You all drop those weapons.

870
01:27:10,779 --> 01:27:13,866
Yeah. Yeah, you!
You there with the pellet gun,

871
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:18,086
drop it or I'll blow
your butt away for sure, buddy.

872
01:27:26,128 --> 01:27:32,176
A pellet gun? Do you think we'd use
a pellet gun for something like this?

873
01:27:32,301 --> 01:27:34,303
Get 'em!

874
01:27:41,101 --> 01:27:43,187
I gotta find Susan.

875
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:50,945
Susan!

876
01:27:51,779 --> 01:27:53,614
Susan!

877
01:28:06,418 --> 01:28:08,003
Uh-oh.

878
01:28:08,587 --> 01:28:10,589
Stop 'em before they get away!

879
01:28:12,758 --> 01:28:15,719
Susan! Susan!

880
01:28:17,972 --> 01:28:20,015
Susan!

881
01:28:59,722 --> 01:29:02,016
Help!

882
01:29:02,891 --> 01:29:04,852
Susan.

883
01:29:09,023 --> 01:29:11,483
Ow! Oh!

884
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:26,040
- Where are we?
- You don't wanna know.

885
01:29:55,152 --> 01:29:58,030
Carl! Carl, over here! Get down!

886
01:30:11,585 --> 01:30:13,295
Come on. Move out.

887
01:30:15,464 --> 01:30:17,508
Move! Everybody in the car.

888
01:30:23,555 --> 01:30:25,599
Get the door open.

889
01:30:27,059 --> 01:30:29,686
- Start the car.
- It won't start.

890
01:30:31,605 --> 01:30:34,858
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

891
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:26,994
<i>Ouch! Be careful!</i>

892
01:31:56,690 --> 01:31:58,734
High five!

893
01:32:05,282 --> 01:32:07,325
Your car, sir.

894
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:33,310
Smile, butthead.

895
01:32:49,284 --> 01:32:51,119
Whoa.

896
01:33:48,051 --> 01:33:50,512
Hey, it's not what it looks like.

897
01:33:51,596 --> 01:33:54,057
We're respectable peace officers.

898
01:33:54,891 --> 01:33:58,436
It's just all one big, funny mix-up.

899
01:34:08,613 --> 01:34:10,448
No!

900
01:34:14,953 --> 01:34:17,289
Shoo! Shoo!

901
01:34:17,414 --> 01:34:18,873
Get outta here!

902
01:34:18,999 --> 01:34:22,127
<i>Good morning! You're listening
to the Poorman on open-line.</i>

903
01:34:22,252 --> 01:34:27,215
<i>We're gonna take our next caller.
Hello! You're on open-line. Go ahead.</i>

904
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:29,551
<i>Yeah, hi. My name's Stacey.</i>

905
01:34:29,676 --> 01:34:33,138
<i>I have a boyfriend who I've been
going out with for two years now.</i>

906
01:34:33,263 --> 01:34:36,224
<i>He works nights
as a delivery boy for a pizza place.</i>

907
01:34:36,349 --> 01:34:38,518
<i>Last night he never came home</i>

908
01:34:38,643 --> 01:34:41,563
<i>and I am positive he is out
sleeping with another girl.</i>

909
01:34:41,688 --> 01:34:45,608
<i>Well, I think you should
definitely dump the dude!</i>
