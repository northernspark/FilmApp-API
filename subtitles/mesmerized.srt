2
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:29,999
Order in court!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,457
Order in court!

4
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,826
Counsel for the defense
of Mrs. Victoria Thompson.

5
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:36,563
Thomas longwood, m.P.

6
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:41,401
That's one of the most expensive
lawyers in New Zealand.

7
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:46,440
The crown against
Victoria Thompson.

8
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:54,714
Victoria, voice-over: Perhaps
this is the way my story began.

9
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:56,382
Perhaps this is the way
I came to be here--

10
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:57,650
Awaiting my judgment.

11
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:59,852
I've imagined it many times,

12
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:00,000
the different ways
it might have been.

13
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,656
The different ways
it might have been.

14
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:25,811
As I've told you in my letter,

15
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:27,513
the child's father
is unknown to me.

16
00:01:27,514 --> 00:01:29,999
It was my express wish
not to know his name.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,017
It was my express wish
not to know his name.

18
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:32,585
My daughter wanted
to keep the child.

19
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:34,520
You understand that
is impossible.

20
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:37,089
Naturally, I want the child to
know nothing of this arrangement.

21
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,925
She will be well cared for.

22
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:40,526
You may be sure of that.

23
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:42,561
Yes, but of course that
is a comforting thought.

24
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:44,830
I was sure it would be so.

25
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,499
You haven't told me her name.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,700
Her name?

27
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:50,303
Yes. What is
the little one called?

28
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:52,606
I don't believe she has a name.

29
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,000
Victoria?

30
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,712
Victoria?

31
00:02:32,813 --> 00:02:34,982
Victoria, somebody's
here to see you.

32
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,469
Are you a relative
of mine, a relation?

33
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:58,538
Do you know me?

34
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:00,000
My name is Oliver Thompson.

35
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,540
My name is Oliver Thompson.

36
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,808
I'm a merchant.

37
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,377
I've, uh...

38
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:05,978
Chain of shops.

39
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,880
It is a small chain,

40
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,048
but, uh...

41
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:12,551
In 10 years' time I
expect to turn a profit.

42
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:14,687
They, uh...

43
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:16,823
They told me of you.

44
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:24,731
Uh... Won't you, uh...

45
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:30,000
Won't you sit down?

46
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,305
Won't you sit down?

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,715
Victoria, have you...

48
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:52,025
Have you ever
considered marriage?

49
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:56,630
In sickness and in health...

50
00:03:57,998 --> 00:03:59,999
To love, cherish,

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,033
to love, cherish,

52
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:03,536
and to obey...

53
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:06,605
Till death us do part.

54
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:09,309
Till death us do part.

55
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:29,462
I'd never pictured
myself as a bride.

56
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:29,999
When the matrons
arranged this marriage

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,464
when the matrons
arranged this marriage

58
00:04:31,465 --> 00:04:33,532
with Oliver, I was
determined to do my best,

59
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,067
but we had been taught

60
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,803
that it was a woman's end
to be a wife.

61
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:40,606
But I was shocked to learn
that although I was wed,

62
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:42,642
I was not yet free.

63
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:49,381
You know, Victoria, my dear...

64
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:52,751
This is where
we must part for now.

65
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,321
You must go back to school.

66
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:57,590
Back? For how long?

67
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,999
Well, until you come of age.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,526
Well, until you come of age.

69
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:02,661
It's just
a short while, my dear.

70
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,664
It's how it's done.

71
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,399
I'm afraid, my dear,

72
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,602
we should both have
to reconcile ourselves

73
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,671
to this period of waiting.

74
00:06:27,948 --> 00:06:29,999
At last,
by the end of the summer,

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,583
At last,
by the end of the summer,

76
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:32,685
I left matron and everything
I had ever known

77
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:34,720
and set sail
for my new married life

78
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:36,623
on the north island.

79
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,832
Very tightly, George.

80
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,437
You never been to
the north island, ma'am?

81
00:07:58,538 --> 00:07:59,999
You travel to join your parents?

82
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,507
You travel to join your parents?

83
00:08:01,508 --> 00:08:03,776
No. I'm going to my husband.

84
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:05,778
Um... My new husband.

85
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,513
Mr. Oliver Thompson?

86
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:08,647
Of tamarind grove.

87
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:10,349
The town has grown of late.

88
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,084
I don't know
the place very well.

89
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:13,519
Nor do I.

90
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,388
I've only met
Mr. Thompson twice.

91
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:18,692
Enjoy your stay, ma'am.

92
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,516
Good evening, Mrs. Thompson.

93
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:19,052
Good evening.

94
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,593
The master is not
at home, madame.

95
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,828
He's not here then?

96
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:30,000
He's had to visit
his sick father in woodford.

97
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,465
He's had to visit
his sick father in woodford.

98
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:36,034
It was only right.

99
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,703
Woodford.

100
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,638
Ah...

101
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,340
Is that far from here?

102
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:45,911
It would take 5 hours at least,
I should say, with fast horses.

103
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:48,814
Did the mas--

104
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:50,783
Did the master leave long ago?

105
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:53,018
This morning, madame.

106
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,853
He left something for you.

107
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:58,391
If you'd do me
the kindness of following.

108
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,945
Master likes to save a penny.

109
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,360
There it is, madame.

110
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,662
A present.

111
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:39,632
He was sorry not to be here.

112
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:09,721
Perhaps you'd like
to go and rest, madame.

113
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:12,725
You must have had
a tiring journey.

114
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:46,052
Ah! Uh!

115
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:27,092
I shall take you around
my shops every so often

116
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:29,999
so you can see what I've
created with these hands,

117
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,896
so you can see what I've
created with these hands,

118
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:33,299
what I've given up my life to.

119
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:44,609
George, get over there!

120
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,345
Come on!

121
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,322
That's my brother George,

122
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:58,457
my wife Victoria,

123
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,999
my parer burley.

124
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,026
My parer burley.

125
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:03,296
Keeping busy, are we,
brother Georgie porgie?

126
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,500
This cheese will be moldy
before we can sell half of it.

127
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:09,434
Nah.

128
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:10,669
Just let me get my hands

129
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,637
on the man who made the
mistake on this order.

130
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:13,805
Well, it's too late for that.

131
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:15,440
What's the wholesale price?

132
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,441
5 for 1 and 8ths.

133
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,442
And sale? 3 shillings.

134
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,077
We'll send everything to shops.

135
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:20,879
Special price. Half a crown.

136
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,681
Oliver, there's
not enough transport

137
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,816
to get all of this to the shops.
Surely, we should hire more porters.

138
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:26,051
Not enough transport?!

139
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,486
Get 10 of those black laggards
from the street corner,

140
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,887
give them a few pence each.

141
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:29,999
They can carry the bloody
barrels on their back.

142
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,880
They can carry the bloody
barrels on their back.

143
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:35,627
Rat! Rat!

144
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:36,628
There he goes!

145
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:37,730
Aah! Aah!

146
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:50,743
All right! Kill the dumb...

147
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:07,759
How about that one?!

148
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,363
That's a championship rat!

149
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:23,975
Well, you were very happy there.

150
00:16:23,976 --> 00:16:26,578
Well, I know. They told me.

151
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,513
Yes.

152
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:29,999
Tis true. We were all happy.

153
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,120
Tis true. We were all happy.

154
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:36,422
It's not what
I'm trying to say, um...

155
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,957
When you're dropped there,

156
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,427
you learn not
to think of happiness.

157
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:44,763
Just as I never thought

158
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:46,698
you'd have a father
or a brother.

159
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,835
Mmm. Brother.

160
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,301
Ahem.

161
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:25,638
Ahh.

162
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:28,306
Has Oliver arrived?

163
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:29,999
He asked me to tell you
he'd be along later.

164
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,720
He asked me to tell you
he'd be along later.

165
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,592
It's beautiful.

166
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:50,061
Perhaps you'd like
to see the dogs.

167
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:52,564
I was going to feed them.

168
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:55,635
Oliver is very proud
of the puppies.

169
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,708
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

170
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:04,843
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

171
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,745
That's Phoebe.
She's my favorite.

172
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:08,613
She had a hard time of it.

173
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:10,548
Does he ever let them free?

174
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,084
Simmons runs them every
morning, once a day.

175
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:15,887
Like clockwork. That's
the way Oliver likes it.

176
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,055
What's the point?

177
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,324
Why does he have them then?

178
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:20,693
Why do you think?

179
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:23,628
Come on, Phoebe.

180
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:24,763
Come on!

181
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:25,997
Come on!

182
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,599
That's it. There you go.

183
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,801
Come on, Phoebe!

184
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:30,000
Come on, Phoebe!

185
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:30,803
Come on, Phoebe!

186
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:45,384
Is that scream still
necessary, my dear?

187
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,324
I mean, we have been...

188
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:55,361
Man and wife
for over a month now.

189
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,697
I thought I'd pick some
flowers for my hair.

190
00:18:58,698 --> 00:18:59,999
I should think we could dispense

191
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,732
I should think we could dispense

192
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,033
with some of the notions

193
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:03,735
the good matrons taught you.

194
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:05,036
You put on airs, Victoria!

195
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:07,073
I prefer it to jewelry.

196
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,459
Victoria?

197
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:30,000
If you could...

198
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,931
If you could...

199
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,969
These hairs have grown out.

200
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,999
Who did this before I came?

201
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,080
Who did this before I came?

202
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:04,462
I went to the barber's
more frequently then.

203
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:09,068
Why don't you go frequently now?

204
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:14,507
What a fine lady,
you are, Victoria.

205
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,693
Well, this isn't a kennel.

206
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,729
Who brought this dog in?

207
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,397
Get it out!

208
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:40,698
You heard father.

209
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:41,966
Simmons, George, anyone,

210
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:44,470
get this dog out of here!

211
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:50,875
Victoria, this is
my father, Mr. Thompson.

212
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:51,976
Uh-huh.

213
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:54,045
I think it's time
to send burley down

214
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:55,413
to Christ church,

215
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:57,315
have him open the next store.

216
00:20:57,316 --> 00:20:58,416
Mmm?

217
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,918
Tired of working
with him anyway.

218
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:00,000
Mm-hmm.

219
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:00,952
Mm-hmm.

220
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:02,320
Yeah.

221
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:03,354
Try this. Cheese, father.

222
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:04,622
You'll like it. No.

223
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:05,624
The rats do.

224
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:08,461
I'll take some.

225
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:12,064
I read a fine joke
in the newspaper yesterday.

226
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:14,299
This one gentleman wants to--

227
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,433
Ah!

228
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:17,335
I don't know
what sort of customs

229
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:18,736
you're used to, Mrs. Thompson,

230
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:23,575
but in our family we like to
show some respect for old age.

231
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,643
Thank you. Right. So...

232
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:28,746
He wants to challenge
another one to a duel.

233
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:29,999
See? So, he says to him,

234
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,615
see? So, he says to him,

235
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,750
"I'll trouble you
for your card."

236
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,853
Says the other one--

237
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,654
Victoria, get that bloody door!

238
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:38,523
Shut--shut the--

239
00:21:38,524 --> 00:21:40,492
It's all right,
George. Sit down.

240
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:42,827
Sit down, George!

241
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:45,597
Go on, son! What did he say?

242
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:48,633
Yeah, right, so...

243
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:49,834
He says...

244
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:52,036
"I'll trouble you
for your card."

245
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:54,506
And the other one says...

246
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:56,741
"So you can put it
on your mirror

247
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:58,510
"in your drawing room and boast

248
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:59,999
that you have gentlemen
visiting you."

249
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,480
That you have gentlemen
visiting you."

250
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:05,985
Visiting you!

251
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,321
Oh, yes.

252
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:11,991
Don't you think it's funny?

253
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:36,715
I used to hide from them
in here when I was a boy.

254
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,719
I'm still hiding from them.

255
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,747
Shh.

256
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:16,454
You're not going
out in this wet.

257
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:18,356
You'll stay the night.

258
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,558
No arguing about it.

259
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,294
Bloody rain.

260
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:26,531
Patty will be knee deep
in mud in the morning.

261
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,499
Last time it rained like this,

262
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,999
the dogs were brown
from head to tail.

263
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,568
The dogs were brown
from head to tail.

264
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:32,470
Not a spot of white on them.

265
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:35,006
Ha ha ha! Took Simmons
about a month

266
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:36,608
to get him clean again.

267
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:39,711
Give him a bath,
a big beast like that.

268
00:23:39,712 --> 00:23:41,879
You best be off, son.

269
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,848
Got work to do tomorrow.

270
00:23:43,849 --> 00:23:47,919
We shall bid
a fond farewell for you

271
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,354
to, uh...

272
00:23:49,355 --> 00:23:51,089
Uh, Victoria,
whatever her name is.

273
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,358
Yes. She's probably
retired to bed

274
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,460
with a book if I know my wife.

275
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:58,029
Ha ha ha! And I believe I do.

276
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,030
Mrs. Simmons!

277
00:23:59,031 --> 00:23:59,999
Yes, sir.

278
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,332
Yes, sir.

279
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,600
Find out what
the missus is doing.

280
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,402
Ask her to come down.

281
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:06,504
The mistress is not
in her room, sir.

282
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:08,641
She's what?

283
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,445
She may go into the kennels.

284
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:16,748
That's where she often goes.

285
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:19,884
She's taken such
an interest, father.

286
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,820
Mmm. Hmm.

287
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:26,824
You really should wait
before you judge.

288
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:29,628
Indeed?

289
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:41,507
Victoria?!

290
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:46,444
Victoria?!

291
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:47,980
You out here?!

292
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:51,984
Aah!

293
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:02,995
Victoria?

294
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:16,008
She's not there.

295
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:19,677
She's nowhere in the house.

296
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:21,746
You're not worried, shorty?

297
00:25:21,747 --> 00:25:23,548
She'll be back?

298
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:25,316
She'll get cold and wet?

299
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,617
Like you are?

300
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:28,353
Come back repentant?

301
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:29,999
She doesn't know
anyone in the area.

302
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,755
She doesn't know
anyone in the area.

303
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:34,025
I think you treated
her too roughly.

304
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:36,661
Ahh.

305
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:39,831
A little lesson won't
do her any harm.

306
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:42,533
You don't know women, son.

307
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:45,002
They're all the same.

308
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,739
All of them.

309
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:53,445
Exceptin' your mother,
of course.

310
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:57,049
Lord have mercy on her soul.

311
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:00,000
What was I saying?

312
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:02,588
What was I saying?

313
00:26:10,963 --> 00:26:12,864
Good morning to you, sir.

314
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,533
Joseph, my father's asleep.

315
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,002
The mistress was kind enough
to give me a gold sovereign.

316
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:19,504
Where is she?

317
00:26:19,505 --> 00:26:20,638
She told me to give you

318
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:21,939
that there piece of paper, sir.

319
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,709
For god's sake, Joseph,
what's the meaning of this?

320
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,778
I did everything
the mistress told me to, sir.

321
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:27,745
Hey, what's going on?

322
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:29,313
I'll take care of this, father!

323
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:29,999
I was driving
to woodford and she said,

324
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,882
I was driving
to woodford and she said,

325
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:34,018
"we ain't going to woodford.
We're going someplace else."

326
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:35,019
Well, where did you go?

327
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,020
Come on, where?!

328
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:37,054
The docks, sir.

329
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,022
Why the docks?

330
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:40,391
I'll shake the living
daylights out of you!

331
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:41,325
Why the bloody docks?

332
00:26:41,326 --> 00:26:42,660
Don't hurt me, please.

333
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:44,595
She gave me a gold sovereign

334
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:46,464
and told me to give you
that there piece of paper.

335
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:47,632
What is it? What is it?

336
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:49,000
It's a pawn broker's receipt.

337
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:50,902
She's pawned the horse and
carriage for 100 pounds.

338
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:53,504
Ah. I warned you about
making this arrangement.

339
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:54,806
Oh, father, be quiet!

340
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:56,942
All we can do now is find her!

341
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:02,781
Here! Right here!

342
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:19,564
Where's the ticket office?

343
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:20,765
Just down there, sir.

344
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:21,732
Come on.

345
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:23,302
We go left, son.

346
00:27:25,537 --> 00:27:27,772
Wait for me, Oliver!

347
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,999
I want to be in the world.

348
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,042
I want to be in the world.

349
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:32,477
I want to know all
that I can know.

350
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:33,812
I want to know!

351
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:38,516
I'd have died if I'd
stayed in that house.

352
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:41,619
Did any ships leave
this port last night?

353
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,687
Several.

354
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:44,555
Do you have any lists
of the passengers?

355
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:45,857
How can I help you?

356
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:48,059
Lists, registers, names,
bloody passengers!

357
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,660
Just wait quietly, please.

358
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:52,063
I'll need to see the--

359
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:53,030
Thompson, Thompson.

360
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,967
Thompson. A lady named Thompson.

361
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:56,968
Uh!

362
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,736
Thompson! Now what's this?!

363
00:27:58,737 --> 00:27:59,999
That's the <i>George Washington
</i> sailing for America.

364
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,705
That's the <i>George Washington
</i> sailing for America.

365
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,406
It's the only one that's--

366
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:04,609
Good god. America?
Where is this ship?

367
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,945
Further down the dock.

368
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:16,053
Why did he come for me there?

369
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:18,590
How did he even know
that I existed?

370
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:23,428
He kept all that
a secret from me.

371
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,065
I felt helpless.

372
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:35,673
Uhh!

373
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,643
Aah! Uh!

374
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,314
Oliver!

375
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:44,583
Watch out, son!

376
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:05,871
You've killed him.

377
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:10,441
Come on.

378
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:11,409
Come on.

379
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,078
You killed my brother!

380
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:15,747
Father, take her away!

381
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,871
Guess what?
George is still alive.

382
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:41,840
Yeah?

383
00:29:45,377 --> 00:29:47,011
Ohh.

384
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:48,613
How is she doing?

385
00:29:48,614 --> 00:29:50,514
She won't speak.

386
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,050
Not a word.

387
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,428
It's all over.

388
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:07,365
I've taken care of everything.

389
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:09,800
Cost you a pretty penny.

390
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:12,938
Luckily, the ship
was about to sail.

391
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:17,643
His body is...

392
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,792
No one will ever know.

393
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:38,062
We shall say
he sailed to America,

394
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:40,865
we never heard from him again.

395
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:44,970
You are a very fortunate girl.

396
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:48,806
We saved you.

397
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:50,474
Don't frighten her, father.

398
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:51,476
No.

399
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:55,413
He was always different
from his brothers.

400
00:30:55,414 --> 00:30:58,350
The runt of the family.

401
00:31:00,385 --> 00:31:02,988
I shall forgive you, Victoria.

402
00:31:03,855 --> 00:31:06,491
Everything will be
different now.

403
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,930
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

404
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:14,965
"He restoreth my soul.

405
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:19,704
"He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

406
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:21,772
"Yea, though I walk
through the valley...

407
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:23,941
"Thou preparest
a table before me

408
00:31:23,942 --> 00:31:25,976
"in the presence
of mine enemies.

409
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:29,999
"Thou annointest my head with
oil, my cup runneth over.

410
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,449
"Thou annointest my head with
oil, my cup runneth over.

411
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,951
"Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

412
00:31:33,952 --> 00:31:37,555
And I will dwell in the
house of the lord forever."

413
00:31:37,556 --> 00:31:39,458
Aah!

414
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,509
Got to get this plate in.

415
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,999
All right. Think you
can handle that?

416
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,440
All right. Think you
can handle that?

417
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:17,362
Just press when you're
ready, all right?

418
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,533
Come on, Nicholas.
Get the old face around.

419
00:32:22,534 --> 00:32:24,770
Ha ha!

420
00:32:25,704 --> 00:32:26,771
So you see,

421
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:27,838
they had arranged everything.

422
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,999
I was pregnant
with Oliver's child,

423
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,442
I was pregnant
with Oliver's child,

424
00:32:30,443 --> 00:32:32,409
he was full of pride.

425
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,079
And our life together
went quietly forward,

426
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,848
the way he had
always foreseen it.

427
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:39,583
All right now.

428
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:40,919
Let's give you this...

429
00:32:42,821 --> 00:32:45,422
Little bunch of flowers.

430
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,925
Yeah, it's lovely.

431
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:49,760
What happened that night

432
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,295
was never mentioned again.

433
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:53,030
But they had made it clear to me

434
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:55,633
that were it not
for their generous protection,

435
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,535
I would surely have
been held for murder.

436
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:58,570
Once more.

437
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:11,383
Now, do it again, my dear.

438
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:57,429
Ah, father.

439
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,999
What do you make of that?

440
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,504
What do you make of that?

441
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,039
A ghost.

442
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,841
If she were to discover--

443
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,577
Don't talk nonsense, father.

444
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:20,986
She believes he's dead.

445
00:34:22,554 --> 00:34:25,456
I hear her scream in her sleep.

446
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:26,724
You must destroy it.

447
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:28,993
Don't worry, father.

448
00:34:28,994 --> 00:34:29,999
Haven't I handled
everything so far?

449
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,463
Haven't I handled
everything so far?

450
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:39,970
You want any of that cheese?!

451
00:34:39,971 --> 00:34:43,307
Do you want any of that cheese?!

452
00:34:43,308 --> 00:34:45,709
Do you want any of that cheese?!

453
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,413
Do you want any of that cheese?!

454
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:57,054
Have you no relatives,

455
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,989
no family solicitor, my dear?

456
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,999
No one?

457
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,091
No one?

458
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:03,994
No. That is why
I have come to you.

459
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:05,996
I've written to the head matron,

460
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:07,598
but I've heard nothing in reply.

461
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,468
I truly doubt that there's
anything I can do for you.

462
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:13,671
Is this your first child?

463
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:16,707
There must be something
you could tell me.

464
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,375
From what you've told me,

465
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:21,045
assuming your
information is correct,

466
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:24,748
the convent arranged
for you at age 18

467
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,483
to marry a gentleman who,

468
00:35:26,484 --> 00:35:27,785
by your own account,

469
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:29,999
does not beat you,

470
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,455
does not beat you,

471
00:35:30,456 --> 00:35:32,323
nor starve you,

472
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:34,925
nor deprive you of his respect.

473
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:38,396
And yet you cannot
remain another moment?

474
00:35:39,664 --> 00:35:40,764
I...

475
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:43,702
I'm afraid.

476
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:47,671
No one will believe me.
No one will understand.

477
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:50,441
If every woman in the
antipedes with the vapors

478
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,643
decided to divorce her husband,

479
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,812
there would be no children,

480
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:56,413
no mothers.

481
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:59,999
You have a long life
ahead of you, my dear.

482
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,418
You have a long life
ahead of you, my dear.

483
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:04,723
That is... Is just
what terrifies me.

484
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,926
I must... Must do something.

485
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:12,664
I must... I must save myself.

486
00:36:16,368 --> 00:36:19,536
And she went in?

487
00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:21,505
Like I said, sir.

488
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:25,342
She went in and stayed in.

489
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:29,446
Rather than having
2 hands or 2 feet,

490
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:29,999
to be cast into
the everlasting fire,

491
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,683
to be cast into
the everlasting fire,

492
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:35,886
and if thine eye offend thee,

493
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:37,521
pluck it out

494
00:36:37,522 --> 00:36:39,858
and cast it from you.

495
00:36:41,426 --> 00:36:43,594
Beloved brethren,

496
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:47,898
let us recall that
we are all one body,

497
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:50,300
body of Christ.

498
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:54,004
And all those near to us
are members of that body.

499
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,773
Blessed in the lord,

500
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:59,643
let us look round
with great attentiveness...

501
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:00,000
For the eyes and
the hands of the devil...

502
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:05,082
For the eyes and
the hands of the devil...

503
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,318
Are everywhere.

504
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,455
A fine preacher.

505
00:37:11,456 --> 00:37:12,857
Yeah.

506
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:19,963
It's no doubt
they added precious.

507
00:37:19,964 --> 00:37:21,999
If you can find--

508
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,469
Be careful, my love.

509
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,639
I just want you to know that...

510
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,999
I know where you have
been in the town...

511
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,576
I know where you have
been in the town...

512
00:37:32,577 --> 00:37:36,046
And how long you've been there.

513
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:39,049
Not just it, my dear.

514
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,386
You see, Victoria,

515
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:46,857
I know now that
I cannot trust you.

516
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:49,693
From now on,
you will be accompanied

517
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:52,563
wherever you go by Simmons...

518
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:54,666
My faithful servant.

519
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,435
And he will report to me...

520
00:37:58,436 --> 00:37:59,999
Your every thought,

521
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,038
your every thought,

522
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:03,808
your every movement.

523
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:10,548
At least until
our child arrives.

524
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:37,542
Aaah!

525
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:03,500
"Yea, though
I walk through the valley

526
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:05,035
"of the shadow of death,

527
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:06,870
"I will fear no evil--

528
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:08,805
"for thou art with me,

529
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:12,509
"thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

530
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,645
"Thou preparest
a table before me

531
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,947
"in the presence
of mine enemies;

532
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:22,586
"Thou annointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

533
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:25,088
"Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me

534
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:26,723
"all the days of my life,

535
00:39:26,724 --> 00:39:29,999
and I will dwell in the
house of the lord forever."

536
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And I will dwell in the
house of the lord forever."

537
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:35,799
Come on.

538
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,869
Let's go.

539
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:41,306
Don't let yourself...

540
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,910
I shall take you home.

541
00:40:14,672 --> 00:40:18,776
Why didn't it happen to me
what happened to that child?

542
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:23,013
It's better to die
in a mother's womb

543
00:40:23,014 --> 00:40:25,650
than to live and never see her.

544
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,852
God has cursed me now.

545
00:40:28,853 --> 00:40:29,999
God would never
judge you for this.

546
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,656
God would never
judge you for this.

547
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:30,000
My one weakness.

548
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:32,783
My one weakness.

549
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:33,917
Only one?

550
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:35,952
Well, I prefer to think so.

551
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:38,523
I hope not.

552
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:42,392
This is very curious.

553
00:41:42,393 --> 00:41:43,894
You're a minister,

554
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:46,063
and yet you show
such an interest

555
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:48,398
in pagan objects.

556
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:50,834
Is this not used
in human sacrifice?

557
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:51,836
Hmm.

558
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:56,073
This is an amulet.

559
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:58,409
For love sickness.

560
00:42:13,624 --> 00:42:15,525
Would you like
something to drink?

561
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:17,395
Yes.

562
00:42:26,738 --> 00:42:29,999
I think I should
let you wait on me.

563
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,400
I think I should
let you wait on me.

564
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:35,880
Victoria!

565
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:39,484
Victoria!

566
00:42:42,053 --> 00:42:44,087
If you're not doing anything,

567
00:42:44,088 --> 00:42:46,723
perhaps you could help me
with the scissors.

568
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:48,725
My, uh...

569
00:42:48,726 --> 00:42:50,427
Whiskers.

570
00:42:50,428 --> 00:42:52,029
You know.

571
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:08,780
Where are they?

572
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:21,925
Oliver!

573
00:43:21,926 --> 00:43:23,928
Where did you leave them last?

574
00:43:27,965 --> 00:43:29,900
My dearest friend,

575
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:30,000
after all I had suffered
and believed for months

576
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:33,470
after all I had suffered
and believed for months

577
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:35,505
you cannot imagine
my profound shock

578
00:43:35,506 --> 00:43:36,873
at what I was to find that day

579
00:43:36,874 --> 00:43:39,076
hidden in Oliver's drawer.

580
00:43:53,391 --> 00:43:54,525
Victoria!

581
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:00,000
Victoria!

582
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:01,799
Victoria!

583
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,402
Coming!

584
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:12,776
No, not that one, Simmons.

585
00:44:12,777 --> 00:44:14,678
Reverend Wilson's are
in the other box.

586
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:15,645
Yes, ma'am.

587
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:16,746
Oh, yes, try one
of mine, Thompson.

588
00:44:16,747 --> 00:44:17,614
What? Why?

589
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:20,083
Thank you. Don't mind if I do.

590
00:44:20,084 --> 00:44:21,918
Ha ha ha ha!

591
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:24,554
It's an improvement, you know?

592
00:44:24,555 --> 00:44:26,389
I have them sent from London.

593
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,858
Ohh. Quite right.

594
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:29,860
Always get the best I say.

595
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:30,000
I was thinking more
about our supper.

596
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,795
I was thinking more
about our supper.

597
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:34,064
You've made a difference
in the kitchen, my dear.

598
00:44:34,065 --> 00:44:35,966
I shall like to go to London.

599
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,667
I've imagined it many times.

600
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:39,536
Ohh, you wouldn't like it.

601
00:44:39,537 --> 00:44:42,305
Nope. More than enough
for a lifetime...

602
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:44,074
Right here,

603
00:44:44,075 --> 00:44:45,308
lifetime? Mm-hmm.

604
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:46,309
Do you think?

605
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,010
Mm-hmm.

606
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:49,779
You take my word
for it, right, Wilson?

607
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,349
Mmm. A lifetime.

608
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:54,451
Now...

609
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:55,719
You want excitement,

610
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,754
you should come down
to the shop.

611
00:44:57,755 --> 00:44:59,999
Both of you. We've had more
business than we can handle.

612
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,657
Both of you. We've had more
business than we can handle.

613
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,559
It's been an excellent autumn,

614
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,894
if I don't say so.

615
00:45:03,895 --> 00:45:05,795
Excellent winter, too.

616
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:08,466
You do say so, don't you?

617
00:45:15,406 --> 00:45:17,774
Someday perhaps we shall
have that holiday

618
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:19,743
I mentioned to you.

619
00:45:19,744 --> 00:45:21,611
Or perhaps we could
go to the cottage.

620
00:45:21,612 --> 00:45:22,913
No, no, no, no.

621
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:25,482
Too busy at the shop right now.

622
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:26,483
Well, later then.

623
00:45:26,484 --> 00:45:28,886
Perhaps we could all go.

624
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:41,865
In the gloom, he charmed her.

625
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:44,768
So she put her mark upon
his forehead, an ash,

626
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:46,570
so that the next day

627
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:49,306
she might recognize
her chosen lord.

628
00:45:49,307 --> 00:45:52,075
Well, if he was so charming,

629
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:54,611
then why would
she not recognize him

630
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:57,347
whether he had
a mark or not? Hmm?

631
00:45:57,348 --> 00:45:59,749
The next morning...

632
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,000
She was disgusted to see
her chosen husband.

633
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:03,653
She was disgusted to see
her chosen husband.

634
00:46:03,654 --> 00:46:06,090
The other chiefs were outraged.

635
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:09,492
Kiwi, the handsome chief,

636
00:46:09,493 --> 00:46:11,294
together with his friend wecca,

637
00:46:11,295 --> 00:46:13,330
took the princess and ran off

638
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:15,632
with lord howell in pursuit.

639
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:17,735
Is this a true tale?

640
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,771
Lord howell killed kiwi.

641
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:24,741
Wecca and the princess ran off.

642
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:27,777
When they reached the
edge of a steep cliff,

643
00:46:27,778 --> 00:46:29,980
wecca hurled the
princess over the rock,

644
00:46:29,981 --> 00:46:30,000
into the black chasm below.

645
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:32,816
Into the black chasm below.

646
00:46:32,817 --> 00:46:35,319
Her last words were...

647
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:40,490
"By the darkness
I was confounded."

648
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:43,928
"By the darkness
I was confounded."

649
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,667
It's not a true story,

650
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:53,536
to answer your question.

651
00:46:53,537 --> 00:46:55,672
A true feeling.

652
00:46:55,673 --> 00:46:58,075
But not a true story.

653
00:47:04,715 --> 00:47:06,716
"And then providing
the subject indicates

654
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:08,485
"a propensity for
indirect influence,

655
00:47:08,486 --> 00:47:09,452
combined with--".

656
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:10,820
Oh, Victoria.

657
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:12,989
Where have you collected
all this rubbish?

658
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,591
Reverend Wilson gave it to me.

659
00:47:14,592 --> 00:47:16,593
It's a very famous book
by Dr. Franz mezmer.

660
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:19,029
You haven't forgotten
what you promised me.

661
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,665
Let me just finish
this chapter, Oliver.

662
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:22,766
No.

663
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:24,034
It's very interesting
if you just listen

664
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:25,402
and let your mind flow.

665
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:27,070
Let your mind flow?

666
00:47:27,071 --> 00:47:29,939
Is that another
of your doctor's teachings?

667
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,000
"Combined times with
actual physical connection

668
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:32,409
"combined times with
actual physical connection

669
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,677
"between subject and teacher

670
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:36,346
"that enables a direct
magnetic flow

671
00:47:36,347 --> 00:47:38,615
"to exist between their
respective unconsciousness.

672
00:47:38,616 --> 00:47:39,916
"To be more precise,

673
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,785
"if during the course
of experiments

674
00:47:41,786 --> 00:47:44,721
the teacher were to hold a
shining or bright object..."

675
00:47:44,722 --> 00:47:46,456
Oliver, shall we try it?

676
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:49,092
You know what I'm waiting for.

677
00:47:49,093 --> 00:47:52,429
And I've been waiting here
for an hour or more.

678
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,898
Ohh. Just let's try it, Oliver.

679
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:57,434
Promise. I'll do anything then.

680
00:47:57,435 --> 00:47:59,369
All right.

681
00:47:59,370 --> 00:47:59,999
"And it will greatly aid
in the transference

682
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,905
"and it will greatly aid
in the transference

683
00:48:01,906 --> 00:48:05,608
"of the teacher's will into the
unconscious of the student.

684
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:07,877
"In so doing, it creates a link

685
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:10,914
"between the two that
proves impossible to sever.

686
00:48:10,915 --> 00:48:11,949
This link provides--".

687
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:29,999
Victoria's been reading to me.

688
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,867
Victoria's been reading to me

689
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:34,437
from one of your scholarly
books, Wilson.

690
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:38,775
It's not all wives that...

691
00:48:38,776 --> 00:48:40,877
Read entire books
to their husbands.

692
00:48:40,878 --> 00:48:42,545
Did you enjoy it, Oliver?

693
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:44,848
What book was that?

694
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:46,750
Dr. mezmer's theories
on the unconscious.

695
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:47,751
That's it.

696
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,452
That's the one.

697
00:48:49,453 --> 00:48:51,955
I should think
that would be a bit...

698
00:48:51,956 --> 00:48:53,557
Modern for you, Oliver.

699
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:56,993
Perhaps, uh...

700
00:48:56,994 --> 00:48:59,999
Perhaps you'd like
to try to hypnotize me.

701
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,864
Perhaps you'd like
to try to hypnotize me.

702
00:49:00,865 --> 00:49:04,033
Nah, I should be glad to serve
as one of your subjects.

703
00:49:04,034 --> 00:49:07,036
Oh, no. I don't think you'd make
a very good subject, Oliver.

704
00:49:07,037 --> 00:49:08,805
You're too full of...

705
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:11,741
Life forces. I don't think
I could capture them all.

706
00:49:11,742 --> 00:49:14,411
Why don't you try anyway?

707
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:19,416
Yes. Do try.

708
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:23,087
All right. Perhaps this once.

709
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:26,990
This is a very new and
revolutionary science.

710
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:28,926
No one knows how
or why it works.

711
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:39,069
Too little is known
of its effects.

712
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,683
Ha ha ha ha!

713
00:49:53,684 --> 00:49:54,884
There. You see.

714
00:49:54,885 --> 00:49:56,921
No wonder. You're too strong.

715
00:49:58,055 --> 00:49:59,999
I shouldn't think you'd
say that about me.

716
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,640
I shouldn't think you'd
say that about me.

717
00:50:02,927 --> 00:50:04,561
Wouldn't I?

718
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:05,930
Do try it.

719
00:51:11,762 --> 00:51:13,998
It's extraordinary.

720
00:51:27,011 --> 00:51:29,379
It's amazing.

721
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:29,999
What'll happen now?

722
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,748
What'll happen now?

723
00:51:31,749 --> 00:51:34,751
What do you want to happen?

724
00:51:34,752 --> 00:51:36,887
Do you want to kiss her?

725
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:41,425
Victoria?

726
00:51:45,596 --> 00:51:48,365
Kiss the man you love.

727
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:08,751
Should we ask for more?

728
00:52:08,752 --> 00:52:10,086
No, no, don't.

729
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:12,588
You can retire if you like.

730
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:15,658
I shall stay with
Victoria for a while.

731
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:17,994
I must break the trance then.

732
00:52:17,995 --> 00:52:20,063
Surely you don't think a husband

733
00:52:20,064 --> 00:52:21,998
is unable to take care
of her adequately?

734
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:23,566
That's hardly the point.

735
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:25,402
Wilson, she's my wife.

736
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,545
I'll believe I'll take a stroll
before bed if that's all right.

737
00:52:45,456 --> 00:52:46,857
Victoria, my dear...

738
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:49,859
I've always longed for...

739
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,695
For...

740
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:06,977
Right. Uhh!

741
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,589
Go on. Give me yours then.

742
00:53:23,694 --> 00:53:25,562
Come on!

743
00:53:31,802 --> 00:53:33,736
Give me one of those rigs.

744
00:53:33,737 --> 00:53:35,038
Give it to me!

745
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:36,706
There's none left, sir.

746
00:53:36,707 --> 00:53:37,707
Then give me yours then!

747
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,342
Sure you'll be all
right, Mr. Thompson?

748
00:53:39,343 --> 00:53:40,543
Never you mind about me, mate.

749
00:53:40,544 --> 00:53:41,712
I wanna be in on this.

750
00:53:46,016 --> 00:53:47,917
You just light it, sir.

751
00:53:47,918 --> 00:53:49,052
Go on. Light it.

752
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:50,053
Light it!

753
00:53:50,054 --> 00:53:51,721
Aah! Uhh!

754
00:53:51,722 --> 00:53:52,889
See one over there!

755
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:54,425
I see it, sir.

756
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,761
This should get rid of them.

757
00:53:58,762 --> 00:53:59,862
Rat!

758
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:00,000
There's a whole batch of
the beggars here, sir.

759
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:02,633
There's a whole batch of
the beggars here, sir.

760
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,001
The master's not well.

761
00:54:05,002 --> 00:54:06,335
Is there a doctor in the area?

762
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:08,504
Yes, madame. There's
a new doctor.

763
00:54:08,505 --> 00:54:09,705
Dr. Finch in clarendon,

764
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:12,075
but I don't know
anything about him.

765
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:14,010
Shall I send the husband to
fetch doctor Finch, madame?

766
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:15,545
Yes, yes. Do that.

767
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:17,648
No. Perhaps I better go myself.

768
00:54:55,853 --> 00:54:57,653
I'm awfully sorry,
Mrs. Thompson,

769
00:54:57,654 --> 00:54:59,999
but, uh, would you mind if I had a
private word with your husband?

770
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,024
But, uh, would you mind if I had a
private word with your husband?

771
00:55:02,025 --> 00:55:04,528
It's all right, my dear.

772
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:18,508
I must ask you a rather...

773
00:55:18,509 --> 00:55:20,743
Personal question, Mr. Thompson.

774
00:55:20,744 --> 00:55:22,078
For the sake of your health,

775
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,579
I would be grateful

776
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,047
if you answered me honestly.

777
00:55:25,048 --> 00:55:27,518
Please bare in mind
that I am a physician.

778
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:29,999
Fire away.

779
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,620
Fire away.

780
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:34,357
Have you ever, or rather
have you in the recent past,

781
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:36,926
have the misfortune
to catch a, uh...

782
00:55:36,927 --> 00:55:39,529
A man's illness?

783
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:42,298
You see, there are symptoms
of poisoning here.

784
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:43,733
Probably by Mercury,

785
00:55:43,734 --> 00:55:45,935
which as you know is used
to kill venereal disease.

786
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:49,071
Doctor, I've never been down
with any illness in my life.

787
00:55:49,072 --> 00:55:50,806
Man's or otherwise.

788
00:55:50,807 --> 00:55:52,676
You have my word.

789
00:55:54,578 --> 00:55:57,914
Well... My diagnosis
is poisoning.

790
00:55:57,915 --> 00:55:59,999
At this moment, I cannot
establish the cause.

791
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,018
At this moment, I cannot
establish the cause.

792
00:56:02,019 --> 00:56:05,054
But fortunately, the state
of illness is not serious.

793
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:07,924
The medicine I'm prescribing
should set it right,

794
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:09,058
very shortly.

795
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:10,826
I assume you've told Dr. Finch

796
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,328
about the rats, Oliver.

797
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:14,331
The rats?

798
00:56:15,332 --> 00:56:16,799
Oh, yeah.

799
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,935
In my storeroom.

800
00:56:18,936 --> 00:56:20,770
Hundreds of them.

801
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:23,373
Brought in some men
to get rid of them.

802
00:56:37,521 --> 00:56:39,622
Look at these rats!

803
00:56:39,623 --> 00:56:42,392
I caught a whole
bloody tribe of them!

804
00:56:44,761 --> 00:56:47,296
And you were present on
this occasion personally?

805
00:56:47,297 --> 00:56:48,431
Of course I was.

806
00:56:48,432 --> 00:56:49,765
I wasn't going to stand by

807
00:56:49,766 --> 00:56:51,901
and let the beasts eat
my entire stock.

808
00:56:51,902 --> 00:56:54,971
You should have mentioned
this in the first place.

809
00:56:54,972 --> 00:56:57,306
It confirms my diagnosis.

810
00:56:57,307 --> 00:56:59,999
Please follow my instructions...

811
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,010
Please follow my instructions...

812
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:02,345
Exactly.

813
00:57:02,346 --> 00:57:04,013
A few days, Mr. Thompson,

814
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:05,748
you'll be as fit as a fiddle.

815
00:57:05,749 --> 00:57:07,783
I'll call again the day
after tomorrow.

816
00:57:07,784 --> 00:57:10,052
In the meantime, you know where
to find me, Mrs. Thompson.

817
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:11,721
And in the future,

818
00:57:11,722 --> 00:57:14,757
I'd advise you not to poison
your rats personally.

819
00:57:14,758 --> 00:57:18,395
Your life is more important
than your goods surely.

820
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:22,865
Is he better?

821
00:57:22,866 --> 00:57:26,069
Yes. Getting stronger
and stronger every day.

822
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:28,871
You must have been frightened.

823
00:57:28,872 --> 00:57:29,999
The doctor says there's
always a danger of a relapse.

824
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,375
The doctor says there's
always a danger of a relapse.

825
00:57:32,376 --> 00:57:33,609
But surely under your care...

826
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,443
What?

827
00:57:34,444 --> 00:57:35,945
He's improving so quickly.

828
00:57:35,946 --> 00:57:37,614
Yes.

829
00:57:43,854 --> 00:57:46,389
Perhaps this is
too tiring for you.

830
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,691
Simmons could push
this bloody chair.

831
00:57:48,692 --> 00:57:50,326
It's good exercise...

832
00:57:50,327 --> 00:57:52,628
As you've spent
the whole month indoors.

833
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:54,764
I'm taking steps
to make it easier,

834
00:57:54,765 --> 00:57:58,067
I've asked my father
to come stay with us.

835
00:57:58,068 --> 00:57:59,435
Your father?

836
00:57:59,436 --> 00:57:59,999
Mmm. Be good company.

837
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,569
Mmm. Be good company.

838
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:02,638
But do you think it wise?

839
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:03,906
Uh, yeah.

840
00:58:03,907 --> 00:58:05,809
You're not strong enough.

841
00:58:07,477 --> 00:58:10,446
Well, he's grown very
fond of you, my dear.

842
00:58:10,447 --> 00:58:13,749
He'll come here as soon as
his affairs are settled.

843
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,685
Looking forward to it.

844
00:58:15,686 --> 00:58:18,521
If we were to go away,
if we were to travel,

845
00:58:18,522 --> 00:58:19,955
he'd be alone in a big house.

846
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:22,358
No, no. Don't
you worry, my girl.

847
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:23,859
You've done enough.

848
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,729
You seen how big
the puppies have grown?

849
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:29,298
I shall put them out
to stud this spring.

850
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:29,999
Ha ha ha ha.

851
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,967
Ha ha ha ha.

852
00:58:56,593 --> 00:58:58,728
George, voice-over:
I cannot express

853
00:58:58,729 --> 00:58:59,999
how happy I was
to learn at long last

854
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,430
how happy I was
to learn at long last

855
00:59:00,431 --> 00:59:02,064
that you were all right.

856
00:59:02,065 --> 00:59:03,833
I know that it is impossible

857
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:05,534
for you to correspond with me.

858
00:59:05,535 --> 00:59:09,872
I hope at the very least
that you will receive this.

859
00:59:09,873 --> 00:59:13,042
I was saddened to learn
that you suffer so greatly.

860
00:59:13,043 --> 00:59:16,011
If there was any possibility
of my sending for you now,

861
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:19,648
you must know I would move
heaven and earth to do so.

862
00:59:19,649 --> 00:59:21,417
I can only hope and dream

863
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:24,787
that Providence will find
a way to unite us one day.

864
00:59:24,788 --> 00:59:27,758
You are always in my thoughts.

865
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:31,854
Mrs. Simmons.

866
01:00:31,855 --> 01:00:34,056
The doctor has prescribed
a special diet.

867
01:00:34,057 --> 01:00:36,058
Oh. Very well, madame.

868
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:38,027
I shall do it myself.

869
01:00:38,028 --> 01:00:39,963
You may go now.

870
01:01:17,868 --> 01:01:20,736
I felt them bite out my throat!

871
01:01:20,737 --> 01:01:21,971
I shouted and screamed!

872
01:01:21,972 --> 01:01:24,039
I couldn't move...

873
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,575
As they bited me more and more!

874
01:01:26,576 --> 01:01:28,043
I was suffocating!

875
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:29,999
You got to help me,
doctor, please!

876
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,579
You got to help me,
doctor, please!

877
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,314
It's quite understandable, Mr.
Thompson.

878
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:34,416
You've had a sudden
high temperature!

879
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:35,951
Such--such dreams
are quite normal.

880
01:01:35,952 --> 01:01:36,952
So take me.

881
01:01:36,953 --> 01:01:40,055
I was better but now
I'm weaker every day.

882
01:01:40,056 --> 01:01:42,491
Life is losing its grip on me.

883
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:44,593
Please, don't worry,
Mr. Thompson.

884
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:47,029
It's just a temporary relapse.

885
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,364
It is unexpected.

886
01:01:48,365 --> 01:01:50,432
These things happen.

887
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:52,902
My teeth are loose...

888
01:01:52,903 --> 01:01:55,438
And my gums are bleeding.

889
01:01:57,374 --> 01:01:59,675
You haven't been poisoning
your rats again.

890
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:00,000
I swear, doctor.

891
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,377
I swear, doctor.

892
01:02:01,378 --> 01:02:03,647
I've never been ill in my life!

893
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,989
Why don't you try and get
some rest now, Mr. Thompson?

894
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:15,958
And, uh...

895
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:17,726
I'll, uh...

896
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:19,495
I'll leave you
another prescription.

897
01:02:19,496 --> 01:02:20,697
Hmm?

898
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:22,058
Ohh.

899
01:04:06,036 --> 01:04:08,804
Oliver's strength slowly waned.

900
01:04:08,805 --> 01:04:11,707
And it was necessary
for the young Dr. Finch

901
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,308
to attend to Oliver,

902
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:16,813
and even on a few nights
to remain at his side.

903
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,855
One night, as I watched
from the window,

904
01:04:26,856 --> 01:04:28,957
I knew the doctor was puzzled

905
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:29,999
by Oliver's lack of response
to treatment.

906
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,294
By Oliver's lack of response
to treatment.

907
01:04:32,295 --> 01:04:35,998
But I knew that I alone had
the power to comfort Oliver,

908
01:04:35,999 --> 01:04:39,335
to calm him, to make him sleep.

909
01:05:43,867 --> 01:05:45,534
Please try to keep calm.

910
01:05:45,535 --> 01:05:47,069
I-I know that it hurts.

911
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:50,372
But it is necessary if you're
to return to good health.

912
01:05:50,373 --> 01:05:51,774
Patience, please.

913
01:05:51,775 --> 01:05:53,743
It won't be long now.

914
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:26,376
Aah!

915
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:56,038
Please accept my deepest
condolences.

916
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:58,607
I'm truly sorry.

917
01:06:58,608 --> 01:06:59,999
This is a great shock.

918
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,609
This is a great shock.

919
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:03,312
Oliver... Business...

920
01:07:03,313 --> 01:07:05,514
To think...

921
01:07:05,515 --> 01:07:09,419
This year we were going to open
a new shop in christchurch.

922
01:08:29,933 --> 01:08:30,000
What have you done...

923
01:08:30,001 --> 01:08:31,934
What have you done...

924
01:08:31,935 --> 01:08:34,670
To my son?

925
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:36,039
Ahh!

926
01:08:40,843 --> 01:08:43,578
Even if god forgives you...

927
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:46,381
I never shall.

928
01:08:46,382 --> 01:08:49,351
I shall make quite sure

929
01:08:49,352 --> 01:08:52,822
that I see you hanged for this.

930
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:57,327
Yes, I will.

931
01:09:18,781 --> 01:09:20,716
This is odd.

932
01:09:20,717 --> 01:09:22,552
The lamp. Lower the lamp.

933
01:09:25,922 --> 01:09:28,090
Good god.

934
01:09:28,091 --> 01:09:29,826
Chloroform.

935
01:09:47,543 --> 01:09:49,412
Thank you for waiting.

936
01:09:57,687 --> 01:09:59,999
And so, dear George,

937
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,023
And so, dear George,

938
01:10:00,024 --> 01:10:02,090
they came for me that morning.

939
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:04,659
It is over now.

940
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,996
And I willingly accept
what lies before me--

941
01:10:07,997 --> 01:10:10,665
Whatever that may be.

942
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:13,569
The earth trembles beneath me.

943
01:10:20,576 --> 01:10:23,045
If I had not stepped
in when I did,

944
01:10:23,046 --> 01:10:24,446
there was every likelihood

945
01:10:24,447 --> 01:10:26,515
you would've been
detained without bail.

946
01:10:26,516 --> 01:10:29,384
Everything is being done,
I assure you.

947
01:10:29,385 --> 01:10:29,999
Your defense is
in the best of hands.

948
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,787
Your defense is
in the best of hands.

949
01:10:31,788 --> 01:10:33,321
I--I did not.

950
01:10:33,322 --> 01:10:34,689
My dear, if
you're trying to tell me

951
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,425
whether or not
you murdered your husband,

952
01:10:36,426 --> 01:10:38,060
I must ask you to stop.

953
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:40,295
You see, I prefer not knowing.

954
01:10:40,296 --> 01:10:42,364
It's much more
satisfying that way.

955
01:10:42,365 --> 01:10:43,632
Now, to go over
it one more time--

956
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:46,034
Have you spoken to our minister, Mr.
James Wilson?

957
01:10:46,035 --> 01:10:47,402
He would defend me.

958
01:10:47,403 --> 01:10:48,770
He knows how Oliver
and I've lived.

959
01:10:48,771 --> 01:10:50,505
I tried to get
an appointment with him,

960
01:10:50,506 --> 01:10:51,873
but I'm afraid it was too late.
Too late?

961
01:10:51,874 --> 01:10:53,408
He'd already left.

962
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:56,011
Left? What are you
talking about?

963
01:10:56,012 --> 01:10:58,046
Your friend, the minister
Wilson, has gone.

964
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,999
Left town the day
you were questioned.

965
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,549
Left town the day
you were questioned.

966
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:03,352
He's been transferred
to Japan... I think.

967
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,522
You did not know?

968
01:11:16,599 --> 01:11:19,502
Order in court!

969
01:11:20,536 --> 01:11:23,639
The crown against
Victoria Thompson.

970
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:29,511
But can you say what was the
subject of the conversation?

971
01:11:29,512 --> 01:11:30,000
All I heard was the
minister Wilson laughing.

972
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:32,547
All I heard was the
minister Wilson laughing.

973
01:11:32,548 --> 01:11:35,817
That was just as I
went past the door.

974
01:11:35,818 --> 01:11:37,052
When I'd brought the tea in,

975
01:11:37,053 --> 01:11:39,688
it had gone quiet again.

976
01:11:39,689 --> 01:11:42,557
Mr. Wilson was standing
by the piano...

977
01:11:42,558 --> 01:11:44,759
With his head in his hand

978
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,896
in a rather peculiar way.

979
01:11:48,731 --> 01:11:50,632
Then I heard voices again.

980
01:11:50,633 --> 01:11:52,934
Mr. Wilson's voice mostly.

981
01:11:52,935 --> 01:11:56,505
But I don't know
what he was saying.

982
01:11:56,506 --> 01:11:58,074
The lord's prayer probably!

983
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:07,315
Moreover, even
the smallest quantity

984
01:12:07,316 --> 01:12:09,684
would cause damage
to the windpipe.

985
01:12:09,685 --> 01:12:11,720
And there is absolutely
no evidence

986
01:12:11,721 --> 01:12:14,389
that chloroform
passed into the stomach.

987
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,759
The throat of the deceased
was not damaged.

988
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,428
And yet your examination
showed an enormous amount

989
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:22,632
of chloroform in the
stomach of the deceased.

990
01:12:23,733 --> 01:12:25,000
I can't--

991
01:12:25,001 --> 01:12:26,701
I can't--

992
01:12:26,702 --> 01:12:29,999
I cannot give an
explanation of this fact--

993
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,373
I cannot give an
explanation of this fact--

994
01:12:30,374 --> 01:12:32,774
Neither I nor
my learned colleagues.

995
01:12:32,775 --> 01:12:33,942
I'm sorry,

996
01:12:33,943 --> 01:12:36,712
but there simply
isn't an explanation.

997
01:12:38,681 --> 01:12:41,817
Surely though, an explanation
must exist, doctor.

998
01:12:43,052 --> 01:12:45,320
If one excludes
supernatural forces.

999
01:12:45,321 --> 01:12:46,621
It would please us

1000
01:12:46,622 --> 01:12:48,557
if you kept
to the facts, doctor,

1001
01:12:48,558 --> 01:12:49,592
not supernatural forces.

1002
01:12:54,397 --> 01:12:55,931
My apologies.

1003
01:12:55,932 --> 01:12:58,400
Did you notice the
presence of chloroform

1004
01:12:58,401 --> 01:12:59,999
at any time in the house
of the deceased?

1005
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,600
At any time in the house
of the deceased?

1006
01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:05,307
Yes, I...

1007
01:13:05,308 --> 01:13:07,576
I saw a bottle
of chloroform there,

1008
01:13:07,577 --> 01:13:11,012
but there were other chemicals
and disinfectants, too...

1009
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:14,317
Used in treating the dogs
as I recall.

1010
01:13:15,651 --> 01:13:17,319
And could you state
how much chloroform

1011
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,754
was in the bottle that you saw?

1012
01:13:22,692 --> 01:13:24,526
You're a doctor.

1013
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:26,728
I can tell you the truth.

1014
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:27,996
When Oliver fell ill,

1015
01:13:27,997 --> 01:13:29,999
he began to behave
very strangely to me.

1016
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,333
He began to behave
very strangely to me.

1017
01:13:31,334 --> 01:13:33,768
It's beyond my power.

1018
01:13:33,769 --> 01:13:35,971
He was so...

1019
01:13:35,972 --> 01:13:37,706
He was so frightening.

1020
01:13:37,707 --> 01:13:40,342
And his mouth...

1021
01:13:40,343 --> 01:13:42,544
The reverend Wilson...

1022
01:13:42,545 --> 01:13:44,813
He's a good friend
of mine, of ours.

1023
01:13:44,814 --> 01:13:47,882
We love each other
like brother and sister.

1024
01:13:47,883 --> 01:13:49,918
I...I...

1025
01:13:49,919 --> 01:13:51,553
I asked him to get me
some chloroform

1026
01:13:51,554 --> 01:13:54,489
so that I might quiet Oliver

1027
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,558
when he got too insistent.

1028
01:13:56,559 --> 01:13:57,959
Quieten him?

1029
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,861
How?

1030
01:13:59,862 --> 01:14:00,000
I...

1031
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:01,463
I...

1032
01:14:01,464 --> 01:14:04,366
I-I-I applied
a drop to his face,

1033
01:14:04,367 --> 01:14:06,635
on a pad of cotton while...

1034
01:14:06,636 --> 01:14:09,371
It always sent him
to sleep, though,

1035
01:14:09,372 --> 01:14:10,905
there was no harm done.

1036
01:14:10,906 --> 01:14:13,074
Do you have the bottle?

1037
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:14,810
Yes.

1038
01:14:25,054 --> 01:14:27,389
In the future, Mrs. Thompson...

1039
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:29,525
You must leave
the treatment to me.

1040
01:14:33,896 --> 01:14:36,298
As far as I can recall,

1041
01:14:36,299 --> 01:14:39,334
there was some 4,
possibly 5 fluid ounces.

1042
01:14:39,335 --> 01:14:41,369
Certainly more
than half the bottle.

1043
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,372
And where is this bottle
now, Dr. Finch?

1044
01:14:45,808 --> 01:14:49,045
It was dropped... And broken.

1045
01:14:58,621 --> 01:14:59,999
Gentlemen of the jury...

1046
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,960
Gentlemen of the jury...

1047
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:04,427
Experts appointed
by the court...

1048
01:15:05,661 --> 01:15:07,429
Experienced physicians...

1049
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:10,799
Have informed us that
medicine cannot explain

1050
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,070
how a poisonous substance
could have found itself...

1051
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:18,407
In the stomach
of Mr. Oliver Thompson.

1052
01:15:19,608 --> 01:15:22,577
We live in an enlightened age.

1053
01:15:22,578 --> 01:15:25,747
So we are bound to listen

1054
01:15:25,748 --> 01:15:29,684
to what the wise
and learned have to say.

1055
01:15:29,685 --> 01:15:30,000
And what they have to
say is the following--

1056
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:32,821
And what they have to
say is the following--

1057
01:15:32,822 --> 01:15:34,756
We do not know...

1058
01:15:34,757 --> 01:15:37,859
How Oliver Thompson died.

1059
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,429
And if, gentlemen,
we do not know this,

1060
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:44,799
how can we possibly give
the blame for his death

1061
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,303
to a frail woman?

1062
01:16:01,317 --> 01:16:02,451
Is that you?

1063
01:16:07,456 --> 01:16:08,724
Yes.

1064
01:16:10,726 --> 01:16:13,061
How can we expect
that such a woman

1065
01:16:13,062 --> 01:16:14,996
has committed a deed...

1066
01:16:14,997 --> 01:16:18,834
That has baffled the
wise and experienced?

1067
01:16:29,545 --> 01:16:30,000
Read to me.

1068
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:31,013
Read to me.

1069
01:16:32,648 --> 01:16:34,383
If you like.

1070
01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:37,787
Do you remember where we were?

1071
01:16:38,954 --> 01:16:40,356
Yes.

1072
01:16:41,624 --> 01:16:44,325
Our law specifies

1073
01:16:44,326 --> 01:16:47,463
the benefit of the doubt always.

1074
01:16:48,564 --> 01:16:50,398
And in this case,

1075
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:54,069
there is evidently
great room for doubt.

1076
01:17:00,009 --> 01:17:02,010
"Lady mader is a gliding woman.

1077
01:17:02,011 --> 01:17:04,846
"Years ago when a tall girl
at a boarding school,

1078
01:17:04,847 --> 01:17:05,814
"she was informed
by the drilling master,

1079

"an ex-yeager,

1081

knowledge of English.

1083

"It is an axiom, I believe,

1084
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:17,025
"among polite lovers that
nothing is so effective

1085
01:17:17,026 --> 01:17:19,294
"as an unintentional compliment.

01:17:19,295 --> 01:17:22,397
"Herr winning's unintentionality,
as he would have called it,

1087
01:17:22,398 --> 01:17:23,498
"was most effective.

1088

"The gazelle, miss spofkins,

1089

1091
01:17:28,938 --> 01:17:29,999

society with 2 daughters."

1104
01:19:32,695 --> 01:19:34,495
It is important that you know

1105
01:19:34,496 --> 01:19:36,732
what transpired
that fateful night.

1106
01:19:37,766 --> 01:19:40,735
Oliver sank
into a deep trance easily,

1107
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:43,671
for the hypnosis
was now our custom.

1108
01:19:43,672 --> 01:19:45,673
And while in that state,

1109
01:19:45,674 --> 01:19:47,775
I gave him chloroform.

1110
01:19:47,776 --> 01:19:49,611
He swallowed it all...

1111
01:19:49,612 --> 01:19:52,348
Without a moment's pain.

1112
01:20:52,307 --> 01:20:55,410
I do not know
what will become of me now,

1113
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:59,547
but I know that I will never,
ever forget you.

1114
01:20:59,548 --> 01:21:00,000
I remain, your servant,

1115
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:02,550
I remain, your servant,

Victoria Thompson.

1117
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,438
Uhh!

1118
01:22:06,315 --> 01:22:08,383
Uhh!

1119
01:22:09,518 --> 01:22:12,587
Ahh!

1120
01:22:12,588 --> 01:22:14,389
Ohh!

1121
01:22:18,794 --> 01:22:20,629
Ohh!

1122
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:23,799
Ohh!

1123
01:22:28,904 --> 01:22:29,999
The jury requests permission

1124
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,372
the jury requests permission

1125
01:22:30,373 --> 01:22:32,774
to ask one additional
question of Dr. Finch.

1126
01:22:32,775 --> 01:22:34,008
Is Dr. Finch present?

1127
01:22:34,009 --> 01:22:37,079
If so, the court
gives permission.

1128
01:22:46,088 --> 01:22:48,823
Doctor, if the chloroform
were applied

1129
01:22:48,824 --> 01:22:50,691
to the deceased
against his will...

1130
01:22:50,692 --> 01:22:52,693
By force...

1131
01:22:52,694 --> 01:22:54,763
Would it leave traces?

1132
01:22:56,532 --> 01:22:58,866
In my opinion, yes.

1133
01:22:58,867 --> 01:22:59,999
And no traces were found?

1134
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,370
And no traces were found?

1135
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:03,738
No.

1136
01:23:03,739 --> 01:23:05,407
Absolutely none.

1137
01:23:08,777 --> 01:23:10,646
We have no more questions.

1138
01:23:16,618 --> 01:23:17,652
Order!

1139
01:23:17,653 --> 01:23:19,020
Gentlemen of the jury,

1140
01:23:19,021 --> 01:23:20,721
have you considered
your verdict?

1141
01:23:20,722 --> 01:23:22,323
We have, your honor.

1142
01:23:22,324 --> 01:23:24,792
Do you find the defendant,
Victoria Thompson,

1143
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:27,061
guilty of the crime
imputed to her...

1144
01:23:27,062 --> 01:23:28,729
Or nay?

1145
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:29,999
Not guilty.

1146
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,300
Not guilty.

1146
01:23:32,305 --> 01:23:38,739
