Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:38,153
Outerspace.

3
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,438
Limitless and timeless.

4
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:47,031
Filled with cosmic explosions
and endless turbulence.

5
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,707
An infinite playground
for that occasional blazing visitor,

6
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,752
the comet.

7
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:57,337
At first comets terrified man.

8
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,342
He thought they were signals
of impending catastrophe.

9
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:04,884
But he got used to them
and he gave names to them

10
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,180
and waited for them
to drop by like old friends.

11
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:10,977
This one has come from behind the sun,

12
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,100
moving across the heavens
at 108.000 miles an hour,

13
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,863
and has never before
been seen by man.

14
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:32,999
The asteroid belt.

15
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:37,010
A vast junkyard
of metal and rock orbiting the sun

16
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,717
between Jupiter and Mars.

17
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:43,264
Thousands of fragments,

18
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:45,725
some as small as a fist

19
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:48,649
some as large as a city.

20
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:52,946
And amongst these Orpheus.

21
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:57,741
Twenty mlles in diameter and undisturbed
for countless generations...

22
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,077
...until now.

23
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:36,929
Give me the horn.

24
00:04:39,357 --> 00:04:40,981
What do you want?

25
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,068
- Is Dr Paul Bradley aboard?
- Who's asking?

26
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:47,523
I've got orders from NASA
to bring in Dr Paul Bradley.

27
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,238
Is he aboard? This is an emergency.

28
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,867
So's this. We're trying to win a race.

29
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,123
We're going to have
to cut across your bow.

30
00:04:57,502 --> 00:04:59,709
All right goddammit. We're coming in.

31
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,472
Mr Sherwood told me to get you off
the boat and on your way to Houston.

32
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:14,518
There's a special jet for you.

33
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,638
- You would've cut across my bow?
- Yes, sir.

34
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:20,645
I would've rammed you.

35
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,070
And gone straight to the bottom, sir.

36
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:46,346
Don't go away. I could be right back.

37
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:54,511
Dr Bradley,
it's good to see you again.

38
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,648
Good to see you again.

39
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:58,609
- You owe me $10.
- I do?

40
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:02,907
- I got my handicap down to 12.
- No wonder it's good to see me again.

41
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:05,317
- Yes?
- Bradley's here.

42
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:07,653
Good. Send him in.

43
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,497
It's yours. Mr Sherwood..

44
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:24,212
Oh, good to see you. Come in, come in.

45
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,513
- Sorry to do this to you.
- Not at all.

46
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:31,893
Yes, I did that I called Helen
and asked her to send your clothes.

47
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:33,524
Hello? Mr Sherwood.'s office.

48
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,686
I, uh...

49
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,238
I didn't know that you and she were...

50
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,613
- You've met General Easton.
- Once, in Washington.

51
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:47,493
- Good of you to come.
- Sam Mason, CAP commander.

52
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,873
Peter Watson, our flight director.

53
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,915
Put that down
and let me fix you a small Scotch.

54
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,880
A large one.

55
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,754
- Good.
- We could all use one, I think.

56
00:06:57,928 --> 00:06:59,967
Why don't we sit around the table?

57
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,178
Take your coat off.

58
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:09,345
- How big is your boat?
- Fifty-two feet

59
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:15,066
An awful lot's been happening here,
Paul. And none of it good.

60
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,442
Harry, I left NASA five years ago.

61
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:20,859
- Why am I back?
- Let me tell you.

62
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,780
Gentlemen, help yourselves.

63
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:27,784
Seven days ago, Palomar Observatory
reported the discovery of a new comet.

64
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,290
- General.
- Thank you.

65
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:32,630
Nothing unusual in that
They spot nine or ten every year,

66
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,256
either themselves
or other observatories.

67
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:38,963
But... it's where this one
seemed to be going.

68
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,225
- The asteroid belt
- Go on.

69
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:47,021
When they called me, it was a couple
of hundred thousand miles from the belt.

70
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:50,525
Challenger ll, our space probe to Mars,
was in the vicinity.

71
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:54,360
General Easton's son,
Tom, was commanding.

72
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:56,608
We got in touch with them,

73
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:58,493
and then we...

74
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:02,200
I...

75
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:04,284
...changed their programme.

76
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,867
That was last Friday.

77
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:39,665
Challenger II,
do you read me?

78
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,291
We read you.

79
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,951
How do you feel
about making a slight detour?

80
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:47,333
Anything to break the monotony.
What do you call slight?

81
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:49,880
Two days, four hours and 32 minutes.

82
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:52,045
What happens to our schedule?

83
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,887
Don't concern yourself, Tom.
We'll take care of everything.

84
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,729
- Mars will have to wait.
- Whatever you say.

85
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:01,565
- Where are we going?
- The asteroid belt

86
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,899
- What for?
- A Comet's about to go through it.

87
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:08,355
- They go through all the time.
- It's a first for this one.

88
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:12,280
It was wrenched out of orbit
by Jupiter's gravitational pull.

89
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,320
- How big is this comet?
- 480 kilometres in diameter,

90
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:20,627
which makes its nucleus large enough
to do real damage if it hits anything.

91
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:24,840
It's headed straight toward Orpheus,
the big one in the centre.

92
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:26,288
Where do we park?

93
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:30,596
Park alongside Vesta,
about 25,000 kilometres this side.

94
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:33,256
You'll be there three hours
before the comet.

95
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:37,349
We want all the information you can
give us on size and orbital elements.

96
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:39,764
- Take a few pictures?
- A lot of pictures.

97
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:44,520
We've already started things down here.
You'll change course in five minutes.

98
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,403
- Is my old man with ya?
- He's here.

99
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,652
- Tell him hello.
- Will do.

100
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:55,033
As I said before, that was last Friday.

101
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,542
Yesterday, Sunday morning,
at 1100 hours,

102
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:01,382
they started to pull up alongside Vesta.

103
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:35,284
- We got it?
- Yes, we've got it

104
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,999
- Can you zoom in on Orpheus for us?
- Can do.

105
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,646
Beautiful.

106
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:56,266
- Let's have some information.
- I'll take some measurements.

107
00:10:56,443 --> 00:11:00,144
For the next hour and a half,
they read the belt for us.

108
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,730
Then what we were waiting for
finally appeared.

109
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:13,659
Magnetic field measuring zero.

110
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:21,424
It'll go straight through like salt.

111
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,141
It's gonna hit it!

112
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:39,531
- Get away from there.
- It's coming apart in a million pieces!

113
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:11,062
I don't think I can ever forgive myself.

114
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:14,232
- I should have figured...
- No guilt Harry.

115
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:18,106
- We'd all have given the same orders.
- Who knows about this?

116
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,277
Nobody at the moment.

117
00:12:21,162 --> 00:12:24,199
We'll have put out a release
right after this meeting.

118
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,044
Why am I here?

119
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:32,424
A chunk of Orpheus is heading
towards Earth, a pretty big one.

120
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:36,257
There are a lot of little pieces
with it and in front of it

121
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,469
It's the big one we're worried about

122
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,468
The figures haven't been worked out,
but six days from now we could be hit.

123
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:46,979
- We have to be prepared.
- That's why we put Hercules up there.

124
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,023
Will you let me finish?

125
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:56,194
I've convened a meeting at NASA
headquarters in Washington for tomorrow.

126
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:59,702
Lucas, Steinberg, Fillmore,
others you know will be there.

127
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,875
I want you to come to that meeting.

128
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:21,769
- I'll come to your meeting.
- We appreciate it Paul.

129
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:25,224
I've delayed a flight
You're leaving in one hour.

130
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,604
Up-to-date material on Hercules.
Something to read.

131
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,855
Your hotel room has been booked.

132
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:33,487
Gladys has your expense arrangements.

133
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:38,573
Why don't you stick a broom up my arse?
I could sweep the carpet on the way out.

134
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:41,370
Haven't changed, have you?

135
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:54,681
See you in the morning.

136
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,978
The Coast Guard  towed
Rob Samuelson to harbour...

137
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:05,098
Among the other nine who failed
to finish was Dr Peterson's Maverick,

138
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,528
who was disqualified
for crossing the line prior to start.

139
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:12,032
John Slabin's Mary Bee collided
with Arnold Parker's Swan.

140
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:14,990
Both suffered
sufficient damage to withdraw.

141
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:18,118
The big surprise
was Paul Bradley's Blithe Spirit,

142
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,911
which withdrew for no apparent reason
early in the race.

143
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:24,840
John Dunning
had a running battle with...

144
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:42,940
- Hello.
- it's late, I wanted to...

145
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:45,899
Paul. Where are you?
Why aren't you on the boat?

146
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:47,983
Uh, Washington.

147
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,371
- How are the kids?
- Jimmy's got a cold.

148
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:56,667
And Julie's bound to get it
and we're still fighting about homework.

149
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:58,994
Apart from that, they're fine.

150
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:02,291
- What are you doing in Washington?
- I'm not sure yet

151
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,590
I was phoning
to let you know where I am.

152
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,421
How are you?

153
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:10,840
Oh... Not bad, you know.

154
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:18,726
- Paul?
- Tell the kids I love them.

155
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:21,092
A chunk of Orpheus
is heading towards Earth.

156
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:24,928
A big one. There are a lot of little
pieces with it and in front of it.

157
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,852
But it's the big one
we're worried about.

158
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,481
The figures haven't been worked out,
but six days from now we could he hit.

159
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:05,461
Sorry I'm late.

160
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:08,545
You and everybody else.

161
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:14,718
- Let me tell you about that
- Either we're in the wrong room,

162
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:17,214
or a lot of brainpower's lost.

163
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:19,384
Nobody else is coming.

164
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:22,396
- Lucas, Fillmore, Steinberg?
- I didn't ask them.

165
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:24,142
- Why not?
- You know why not

166
00:18:24,316 --> 00:18:26,854
Because we don't need them!

167
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:29,779
You. You originated Hercules.

168
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,732
Out it out, Paul. I know how you feel.

169
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,580
- Dredging up old...
- I'm dredging up nothing.

170
00:18:36,746 --> 00:18:38,870
- I can taste it right now.
- Now, look

171
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,330
It wasn't my decision
to turn Hercules...

172
00:18:41,502 --> 00:18:43,958
- Into what?
- Will you listen to me?

173
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,424
It wasn't designed as a nuclear weapon,
with 14 warheads pointed at Russia.

174
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:51,049
- Not only Russia.
- Or China. Whatever else!

175
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,804
Those rockets were supposed
to point outwards, not in!

176
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:58,594
They were meant to defend us
against the threat we're facing now.

177
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,515
- Didn't I yell at them?
- Yeah.

178
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,517
- Didn't I stand up for you?
- Yes.

179
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:04,234
Then listen to me.

180
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:06,478
Will you listen to me?

181
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:10,404
That meteor's five miles wide
and it's definitely gonna hit us!

182
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:16,029
It would make a hole big enough
to put the Atlantic in.

183
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,116
Shit Five miles.

184
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:21,037
Now walk out!

185
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,755
And General Adlon? Isn't he in charge?

186
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:28,464
Adlon's a good man, technically.

187
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:31,176
But he's two-dimensional.
You know that.

188
00:19:31,349 --> 00:19:33,757
We've got to find a way
to move him out.

189
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:38,016
That's problem number one.
Problem number two,

190
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,773
there are about 100 guys
stupid enough to resist using Hercules

191
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,984
because of what
it would mean politically.

192
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,401
- What am I supposed to do?
- Help me ride over them.

193
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:54,623
OK you son of a bitch. I'll help,
but i want it straight up and down.

194
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,535
You've got my word.

195
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,207
Those rockets have got to be realigned
and we've got exactly five days.

196
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:03,777
I hope no one has been so foolish
to contact the Russians about all this.

197
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,488
It would be inadvisable...

198
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:10,708
No one would think of doing that
without your approval, Mr Secretary.

199
00:21:10,876 --> 00:21:14,246
You can be sure they know all
there is to know about the meteor.

200
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,747
They don't know
what we're planning to do.

201
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:20,045
What we're discussing.
I hope it's still discussion.

202
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,550
General Adlon, I assure you
that no decisions have been made.

203
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:28,770
That's what this meeting's
been called for, to decide what to do.

204
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:31,263
You're in charge of Project Hercules.

205
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:34,110
If the result of this meeting
is to make use...

206
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:37,611
There's nothing else.
The only thing we've got is Hercules.

207
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:42,693
Dammit Hercules is not up there either,
as far as anybody but we are concerned.

208
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,654
It's got to stay that way.
We have never admitted to Hercules.

209
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,241
- If we admit to it now...
- We have to!

210
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:53,002
You can't keep the whole world
in the dark about what's going on.

211
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:57,254
Once they know that a five-mile hunk
of rock is gonna hit at 30,000 mph,

212
00:21:57,428 --> 00:22:00,465
people will want to know
what we intend to do about it.

213
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,508
You're gonna tell the entire world
we have nuclear rockets out there

214
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:09,479
in direct contradiction to every
international agreement we've ever made?

215
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,434
That's an invitation to being called
liars and warmongers by every...

216
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:16,318
It's
international murder if we don't!

217
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:18,116
What do you want to do?

218
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:20,906
You want to meet it
with BB guns and slingshots?

219
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,947
Please! Gentlemen!

220
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:30,211
Dr Bradley, would you please
tell us what would happen

221
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,876
if this meteor struck us?

222
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:36,804
A massive rock, one mile wide,

223
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:39,724
travelling at 30,000 miles per hour,

224
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:43,510
would cause a crater 50 miles across
and five miles deep.

225
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,102
Orpheus is five miles wide.

226
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:49,731
Its striking force is equal to...

227
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:53,696
...2,500,000 megatons of TNT.

228
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:56,990
That is ten orders of magnitude

229
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:00,079
above the largest earthquake
ever recorded.

230
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:05,419
It would throw into the
atmosphere five billion tons of earth,

231
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:08,339
and reduce solar radiation
for decades to come.

232
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:11,963
It could cause another Ice Age.

233
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:15,054
What if the thing doesn't hit?
There's some chance.

234
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:18,260
- Every scientific facility...
- You have been wrong!

235
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:21,353
You were wrong
to send Challenger II off its course!

236
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,395
I don't have to listen to this!

237
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:26,104
Please!

238
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:28,815
You're out of order!

239
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:32,274
At ease, gentlemen.
Dr Bradley, where are you going?

240
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,075
I need air.

241
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:38,372
I don't give a damn what Russia says
about America or vice versa.

242
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,826
I told you what's gonna happen
when that meteor hits.

243
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,580
If you think you can prevent it

244
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,291
by burying your heads
under a blanket of shit fine.

245
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,920
If you reach a decision,
I'll be in the bar across the street.

246
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,139
I'll have to discuss this
at the White House.

247
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,896
In time,
because there's damn little time.

248
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,202
We are now
going to replay a recording

249
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,490
of a broadcast made
by them earlier today.

250
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:20,541
The British Cabinet met to discuss the
announcement by Jodrell Bank Observatory

251
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:23,797
that a piece of an asteroid
knocked out of orbit by a comet

252
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:26,291
is on possible collision course
with Earth.

253
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:30,383
In less than a week, this
giant object could strike our planet,

254
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:33,511
causing untold damage
and great loss of life.

255
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:37,683
The Prime Minister is in consultation
with the American President...

256
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:39,055
Put the game on!

257
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:42,602
...and volunteered every assistance
the government can give.

258
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:45,021
We consider it deplorable

259
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:48,283
that the American people
should he dependent on the BBC

260
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:52,580
to supply us with facts
that we have a right to know.

261
00:24:52,748 --> 00:24:56,200
I consider it deplorable
I don't have a drink.

262
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:58,169
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch.

263
00:24:58,337 --> 00:25:00,959
- A large one.
- A large one.

264
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:03,169
What happened?

265
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:05,336
They're calling the President.

266
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:08,055
What if he says no?

267
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,222
A couple of years ago,

268
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:18,933
my son, Andy, started to complain
about pains in his stomach.

269
00:25:19,111 --> 00:25:22,231
All the junk food kids eat,
I wasn't a bit surprised.

270
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:25,690
But he kept on complaining.

271
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:29,154
I had a talk with Miriam
and we decided to take him to a doctor.

272
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,407
Just for an opinion, you understand.

273
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:37,000
Appendicitis, the doctor said.

274
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:40,873
Miriam said, "Let's wait till tomorrow.
The pain will go away. "

275
00:25:41,969 --> 00:25:45,837
You know my Miriam. She can't
stand the thought of an operation.

276
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:50,143
That night when she went to bed,

277
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:52,352
she cried herself to sleep.

278
00:25:53,357 --> 00:25:56,144
I went and picked him up
and took him to a hospital.

279
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:59,937
Six hours later his appendix was out,
he was feeling better,

280
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:03,733
and Miriam... Miriam was all smiles.

281
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:08,371
You get my point?

282
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:09,869
Yeah.

283
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,833
How do you sneak me into a position
where I can fire nuclear warheads

284
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,000
without Miriam knowing?

285
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,928
I'll do it,

286
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:23,219
if I can't do it any other way.

287
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,430
Is there a Mr Sherwood. here?

288
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:29,302
- Yeah, that's me.
- Telephone, right through there.

289
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:32,351
Thanks.

290
00:26:55,801 --> 00:27:00,511
Mr Secretary, I'd rather not call back
I'd appreciate it if you held on.

291
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:04,265
Yes, Dr Bradley is checking out
the information to verify.

292
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:07,893
Yes, sir, I do think it's urgent.

293
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:11,066
- No, sir. Paul.
- In a minute.

294
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:13,275
It's coming up now, sir.

295
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,902
- What do I tell him?
- How good is his health?

296
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:20,447
- Confirmed?
- Confirmed. Hercules is light.

297
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:25,992
Mr Secretary, it's been confirmed.

298
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:29,538
So, what you're telling me is that...

299
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,003
...even if we admit to Hercules

300
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:38,754
and I give you my permission
to realign the rockets,

301
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:41,471
we still need more firepower?

302
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:44,100
More nuclear mega-tonnage?
More rockets?

303
00:27:44,272 --> 00:27:46,265
That's right Mr President.

304
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:50,653
- Mr Secretary, do we have more rockets?
- Not in space, sir.

305
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:54,025
What are we supposed to do,
conjure them out of air?

306
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:59,365
Mr President, would you confirm
what I'm about to say?

307
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:03,584
The Russians have their own equivalent
of Hercules out in space.

308
00:28:03,752 --> 00:28:06,160
True or not true?

309
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:09,214
True.

310
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:15,129
Mr President, we need
the combined power of theirs and ours.

311
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:18,059
- They'll never admit it
- We'll make them.

312
00:28:18,226 --> 00:28:20,848
- How?
- General Adlon,

313
00:28:21,021 --> 00:28:24,058
for the time being,
until this crisis is resolved,

314
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:29,150
I am putting Dr Bradley in charge
of Operation Hercules.

315
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:34,075
I rely on you to give him
every aid and assistance.

316
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:40,371
- I hope I'm public-spirited enough...
- I'm sure you are.

317
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:44,790
Listen, I think I have a solution
to this problem.

318
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:49,293
- Where will you be this evening?
- We're flying to New York.

319
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:52,925
Make sure you hear
my broadcast at 8.00.

320
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,257
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.

321
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:02,016
You'll ask
what steps have been taken

322
00:29:02,192 --> 00:29:08,029
to make sure that this meteor
never comes near the Earth's surface.

323
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:11,366
I'm happy to tell you that realizing

324
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:15,035
that such an emergency
as this could arise,

325
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:17,080
your government,

326
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,331
in collaboration with the best
scientific brains at its disposal,

327
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:27,086
developed a project
to deal with this emergency.

328
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:32,511
That project has been named Hercules.

329
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:34,970
What is Hercules?

330
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:38,182
Hercules is an armed,
orbiting satellite

331
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,362
its nuclear weaponry
almed toward outerspace.

332
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,103
Right name. Wrong direction.

333
00:29:46,283 --> 00:29:48,691
What can Hercules do?

334
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:51,277
It can send, at the press of a botton,

335
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:55,667
enough power to destroy any foreign body

336
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,540
on a collision course with our planet.

337
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:03,340
But, in this case,
a special circumstance has arisen.

338
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:08,929
The meteor is of such size and velocity
that even this powerful weapon...

339
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,677
...cannot do the job entirely.

340
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:20,688
Fortunately, the Russians, with
the same foresight that we possessed,

341
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:23,021
mounted their own defense weapon.

342
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:26,449
We do not know what the Russians
have called their weapon,

343
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:29,704
but we know it exists.

344
00:30:29,873 --> 00:30:35,248
And we are going to ask them to
combine their nuclear power with ours,

345
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:40,167
so that together we will
be able to deal with the meteor,

346
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:43,593
to strike it with irresistible force

347
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:48,805
and to end forever
its potential danger to us all.

348
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:52,477
I will, myself,
be speaking with the Russians

349
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:56,064
Immediately after
I finish this broadcast.

350
00:30:56,236 --> 00:30:58,941
- The game is on.
- Good night.

351
00:30:59,114 --> 00:31:01,570
And God bless you.

352
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:43,949
Hello?

353
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,458
- Do you have a pass for Dr Bradley?
- Good morning, sir.

354
00:32:34,637 --> 00:32:37,757
- General Adlon come in yet?
- Half an hour ago.

355
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:51,152
- How far down?
- Right next to an old subway station,

356
00:32:51,322 --> 00:32:54,074
a section that runs under the Hudson.

357
00:32:54,242 --> 00:32:58,703
It made it easy for us to bring
the equipment in and it saved millions.

358
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:02,206
Why not some sensible place,
like Houston?

359
00:33:02,376 --> 00:33:03,835
Mm-mmm.

360
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:08,582
This has easy access to a total
telecommunications set-up above us.

361
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:10,300
Nobody in their right minds

362
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:13,635
would put their most important
emergency striking power

363
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,715
under the busiest city in the world.

364
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,775
This is Dr Bradley.

365
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:28,313
Can I see your pass, sir?

366
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:31,607
Would you mind signing it sir?

367
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:37,283
Thank you.

368
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,663
Command to Internal.

369
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:47,671
Central Control, call 8-1-2-4.

370
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:01,431
General Adlon, most impressive.

371
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:03,352
Thank you. A message for you.

372
00:34:03,527 --> 00:34:07,905
Normally we work with 25, but since it's
an emergency i brought in the full crew.

373
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:10,744
Good news.
The Russians are coming.

374
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:15,122
I consider allowing the Russians
to come into this centre a grave error,

375
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,039
which one day the United States
may bitterly regret.

376
00:34:19,211 --> 00:34:21,584
- I'd like to meet the staff.
- Of course.

377
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:24,840
General, may I use your office
for a moment?

378
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:26,801
Certainly. This way.

379
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,220
This is our chief technician,
Rolf Manheim.

380
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,099
- Rolf.
- Dr Bradley.

381
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:36,936
You have been teaching my nephew at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

382
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:38,393
- Ben Manheim.
- Yes.

383
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:41,686
He's a bright boy.
He'll be teaching me in a couple years.

384
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:44,020
All stations give status now.

385
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:47,234
This is our trajectory analysis officer,
Jan Watkins.

386
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:49,817
- Hello.
- I suppose you're tied into 1180?

387
00:34:49,995 --> 00:34:53,614
No. At 360,
with a custom-designed memory.

388
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,837
Like I said, I'll be asking you
and your computer a lot of questions.

389
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:00,792
- We'll give you prompt answers.
- Triple-checked.

390
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,540
My assistant, Alan Marshall.

391
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,465
Dr Bradley, I've got Sir Michael Hughes
from the Jodrell Bank Observatory.

392
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:10,349
He'd like a word with you.

393
00:35:10,518 --> 00:35:11,894
Excuse me.

394
00:35:12,562 --> 00:35:15,184
I'm Bill Hunter, in charge of tracking.

395
00:35:15,357 --> 00:35:17,184
What else are you linked with?

396
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,815
Hong Kong, Arecibo and New South Wales.

397
00:35:23,032 --> 00:35:26,033
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good evening, Paul.

398
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:29,492
I didn't expect to see you
until Wimbledon.

399
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:31,704
Assuming there'll be a Wimbledon.

400
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,334
What have you got?

401
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:36,503
Expect the first splinters in 24 hours.

402
00:35:36,672 --> 00:35:40,967
Doubtful if we can track them unless
they're in clusters. We'll do our best.

403
00:35:41,136 --> 00:35:44,968
- Anything else?
- No. I just wanted to make contact.

404
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:48,592
We'll keep in constant touch.
Until then.

405
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,352
Paul, the Russian astrophysicist
you asked for?

406
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:56,479
- Dr Dubov?
- He's arriving at 7.30 this evening.

407
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,214
Dr Dubov, are we glad to see you here!

408
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,217
Thank you.

409
00:36:51,798 --> 00:36:56,211
Twenty-two, 47, colon, 56 point 55.

410
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:09,352
He assumes this is an accurate
representation of the satellite.

411
00:37:17,827 --> 00:37:21,077
Or is the direction
of the rocket just accidental?

412
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:24,414
I am not prepared
to volunteer strategic information.

413
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:34,294
- Is that what I said?
- Yes, sir.

414
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:39,848
- Please.
- Thank you.

415
00:37:40,018 --> 00:37:42,509
What striking power does it carry?

416
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:46,221
I'd prefer you got that
from Dr Bradley.

417
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,230
Good morning.

418
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:54,740
Fourteen rockets,
each carrying a 100 megaton bomb.

419
00:37:57,663 --> 00:38:01,827
Welcome to New York Dr Dubov.

420
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:04,753
- Everything in duplicate?
- It's a procedure.

421
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:07,875
How else do we know we're
being interpreted properly?

422
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:14,045
I think we could all start
by trusting each other.

423
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,308
Otherwise, what's the point?

424
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,347
If it's a matter of choosing,
I'll take the pretty one.

425
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:31,857
The pretty one
is Tatiana Nikolaevna Donskaya.

426
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:33,694
- Did I say it right?
- Very good.

427
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:36,361
Astrophysicist
and Dr Dubov's English voice.

428
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:38,081
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

429
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,705
The captain
is General Adlon's Russian voice.

430
00:38:40,877 --> 00:38:41,909
- Sir.
- Hi.

431
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:46,132
Since it appears we are redundant here,
if you'll excuse us.

432
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,791
Mr Sherwood.,
I'd like to see you outside.

433
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,921
I'll see if I can't calm him down.

434
00:38:55,352 --> 00:38:58,057
He thinks General Adlon
is not pleased to see him.

435
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,433
- I know this is difficult for you...
- Mr Sherwood!

436
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,017
I spoke to the Secretary of Defense,

437
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:07,362
who seems more aware
of the complexity of the situation.

438
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:09,988
- But...
- His orders are, and I quote,

439
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,366
"No change in the direction of rockets

440
00:39:12,537 --> 00:39:17,330
until the Russians admit they've got
their own and agree to realign them. "

441
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:20,040
- Is that understood?
- Look.

442
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:23,499
Why don't you Xerox
100 copies of that report,

443
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:26,629
pass them out among
100 guys in Washington,

444
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:29,377
then organise
100 meetings to discuss it

445
00:39:29,556 --> 00:39:34,385
By that time the meteor will have hit
and we won't have any more problems.

446
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:46,733
He doesn't mean to criticize,

447
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:49,827
but you will not find it easy
to hit a meteor

448
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:52,831
with your warheads
pointing toward the USSR.

449
00:39:54,835 --> 00:39:57,373
We call ours Hercules.
What do you call yours?

450
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:08,347
How can one give a name
to that which does not exist

451
00:40:11,061 --> 00:40:14,015
Then who put up this thing
called Peter the Great

452
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:17,348
its warheads pointing
at the United States?

453
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:28,202
Chinese, perhaps.

454
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,538
Dr Dubov, we've gota slight problem.

455
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:38,374
If Peter the Great does not exist,
we are out of business.

456
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,468
But if it does exist,

457
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:45,966
I'd have to know what weapons
it would be carrying...

458
00:40:46,142 --> 00:40:48,265
...where it was...

459
00:40:48,436 --> 00:40:52,351
...and what frequencies we would
have to use to align it with Hercules.

460
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,858
Now, for purposes of discussion only...

461
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:09,492
He understands
the importance of your questions.

462
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:16,961
If he had been involved in construction
of such an illegal weapon...

463
00:41:22,766 --> 00:41:26,764
...he could then, of course,
theoretically, answer those questions.

464
00:41:29,106 --> 00:41:32,475
Then would you be prepared,
theoretically, of course...

465
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:39,111
...to work out the details with me
as to how we link the satellites?

466
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:47,247
Yes, he would be ready.

467
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:49,625
Before that,

468
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:52,714
what would you have designed
your striking power to be?

469
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:06,312
Sixteen rockets, each carrying
mega-tonnage, the same as your own.

470
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:10,560
That gives us a billion plus.

471
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,983
Theoretically.

472
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,240
Theoretically.

473
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:25,675
I give the floor
to the first speaker on my list,

474
00:44:25,844 --> 00:44:27,422
a representative of Canada.

475
00:44:27,596 --> 00:44:31,594
We have information that a
disturbance of earthquake proportions

476
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:33,926
has occurred somewhere in Siberia.

477
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:38,184
I believe that all of us here
are aware of that fact.

478
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:44,687
Would the Russian delegate tell us
what was the cause of the disturbance?

479
00:44:48,494 --> 00:44:52,279
Mr President,
we would like to request a recess

480
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:55,494
while we consult further
with our government.

481
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:13,563
At my next mark,
it will be 2300.

482
00:45:13,731 --> 00:45:16,518
- We are in test number 36.
- Good morning.

483
00:45:16,692 --> 00:45:19,860
- Did you get any sleep last night?
- A couple of hours. You?

484
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:23,363
I played gin rummy and lost.
What's the Russian girl like?

485
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:26,404
Very nice, very bright and forget it.

486
00:45:26,578 --> 00:45:28,156
I missed you.

487
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,163
...approaching X plus six minutes
on the attitude control test

488
00:45:32,335 --> 00:45:34,624
and all station monitors are green.

489
00:45:39,843 --> 00:45:41,670
With compliments.

490
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:44,930
I had them strip your bed
and put on some proper sheets.

491
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,637
- That's kind.
- I've got some decent soap,

492
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,595
because using the stuff here
is like washing your hands with a rock.

493
00:45:51,773 --> 00:45:54,893
- Thank you. That's a pretty scarf.
- Thank you.

494
00:45:55,068 --> 00:45:58,853
Will Jim Jackson
report to the security office.

495
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:09,037
His hours are confused.

496
00:46:10,461 --> 00:46:12,833
- How about you?
- Oh, I'm all right

497
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:19,041
System analysis team
will review power problems

498
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,925
at 0800 tomorrow in conference room.

499
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:47,914
- Should I wake him?
- Let him sleep. Have some coffe.

500
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:53,255
Commands for attitude
control updates programmed in Hercules.

501
00:46:55,302 --> 00:46:56,678
How long have you been with him?

502
00:46:56,846 --> 00:46:59,135
I've known him for ten years.

503
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:01,679
But I've only worked with him for five.

504
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:03,891
Why did you choose astrophysics?

505
00:47:04,062 --> 00:47:05,853
- It chose me.
- How?

506
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:09,606
I was a telephone operator
at a centre for controller flight

507
00:47:09,777 --> 00:47:12,647
in a cosmodrome
by Kannur in Middle Asia.

508
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:15,906
I knew your language
because when I was a child

509
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:18,483
my mother kept
giving me books in English

510
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:21,829
and telling me that one day
I would be grateful to her.

511
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:23,872
I suppose I am. Would you like one?

512
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:26,249
No, thanks. Go on.

513
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,370
Then, about ten years ago,
some British scientists came to Russia

514
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,756
to meet with some of our people.

515
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:36,012
Alexei Serich, our Sleeping Beauty,

516
00:47:36,181 --> 00:47:40,345
needed someone to translate for him,
and they asked me.

517
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:41,800
His English voice.

518
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:44,649
When I finished,
he asked me to stay on with him

519
00:47:44,816 --> 00:47:47,817
as interpreter and third assistant.

520
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:51,355
He was married to Olga Alekseevna then,
his first wife.

521
00:47:51,531 --> 00:47:54,449
- How many's he had?
- He's on his fourth.

522
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:58,573
He's sleeping alone now,
but just not very often.

523
00:47:58,748 --> 00:48:01,784
You know,
it's very nice talking with you.

524
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,454
Thank you.

525
00:48:03,628 --> 00:48:05,835
We've been talking for almost two days.

526
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:08,924
No. I've been talking
with you and Dubov.

527
00:48:09,093 --> 00:48:11,299
I mean talking with "you", you.

528
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,800
- Very attractive.
- Thank you, again.

529
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:18,549
- Then...
- Then?

530
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:20,970
- Astrophysics.
- Oh!

531
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:25,393
Well, I realized
that space fascinated me.

532
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:29,188
Alexei Serich saw this
and he encouraged me.

533
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,572
He arranged for me to go to university.

534
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,661
And when I returned,
I was an astrophysicist.

535
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:41,248
- That's when I met my husband.
- Your husband?

536
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:45,837
He was a cosmonaut
We were together for three years.

537
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:50,053
And then he went
on an exploratory mission,

538
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:52,214
and he didn't come back.

539
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:55,800
And now? Is there anyone?

540
00:48:57,605 --> 00:49:00,559
Nothing serious. Not really.

541
00:49:00,733 --> 00:49:04,778
Dr Bradley,
Sir Michael is reporting on the monitor.

542
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:07,272
There are meteors over Central Europe.

543
00:49:08,575 --> 00:49:11,446
Ah, Paul, the observatory
in Frascati is reporting.

544
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,868
There's a cluster big enough to track
coming in over Italy south of Pisa.

545
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:19,162
Speed of approach,
15,000 metres per second.

546
00:50:00,675 --> 00:50:04,341
They've burnt up!
The clusters evaporated.

547
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:06,968
Frascati says that
not one of them got through.

548
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:11,305
The whole thing's been nothing more
than a gigantic fireworks display.

549
00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:13,935
Thank you. That's the best news yet

550
00:50:14,107 --> 00:50:16,230
We'll try and keep it that way.

551
00:50:17,527 --> 00:50:20,101
Bradley!

552
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,736
I think we can assume
the emergency's over.

553
00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:25,530
This one, and the emergency in general.

554
00:50:25,703 --> 00:50:29,535
It's a pity the world's been sent
into a state of unnecessary panic.

555
00:50:29,707 --> 00:50:33,242
There's your threat,
Dr Bradley, a fireworks display!

556
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,794
Tell this arsehole once and for all,
Orpheus will not burn up. It's too big!

557
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:41,091
We've got enough to deal with here.

558
00:50:41,262 --> 00:50:44,762
We don't need any
additional aggravation from you!

559
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:47,803
Not one promise
of calamity has come true.

560
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:53,394
As far as I'm concerned,
not a single one will!

561
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:58,280
When common sense is restored

562
00:50:58,448 --> 00:51:03,406
and the President has returned
the control of this centre to me,

563
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:07,529
I shall return to this centre!

564
00:51:38,784 --> 00:51:42,200
He wishes to telephone
the Russian Embassy in Washington.

565
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:03,682
The USSR

566
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:08,433
is not unaware of the seriousness
of this situation.

567
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:12,061
We have, therefore, decided

568
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:15,073
to add to the power of Hercules

569
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:19,655
the considerable power
that we, ourselves, possess.

570
00:52:21,206 --> 00:52:26,248
A satellite, developed before
the United States developed theirs.

571
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,715
But which we designed and constructed

572
00:52:30,884 --> 00:52:35,380
for the purpose of defense
against possible disasters

573
00:52:35,556 --> 00:52:38,094
such as the one confronting us now.

574
00:52:38,267 --> 00:52:40,260
For that purpose only!

575
00:52:40,603 --> 00:52:46,606
The USSR
will always support any exercise,

576
00:52:46,693 --> 00:52:50,228
the primary object of which

577
00:52:50,405 --> 00:52:52,897
is to the benefit of mankind.

578
00:53:10,636 --> 00:53:13,840
- To Peter the Great.
- To the Russian cutting of red tape.

579
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:17,219
Peter the Great.

580
00:53:25,278 --> 00:53:28,777
Dr Dubov would like to tell you
words he heard from a taxi driver

581
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:30,740
when he was last in America.

582
00:53:32,244 --> 00:53:34,699
Walk the Dodgers!

583
00:55:19,571 --> 00:55:22,822
Attitude correction complete.
Situation nominal.

584
00:56:49,713 --> 00:56:51,671
This is Goldstone.

585
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:55,886
We have a realignment interrupt.
Realignment Interrupt. Copy.

586
00:56:56,054 --> 00:56:58,296
Readjustment malfunction.

587
00:56:58,473 --> 00:57:01,759
Deployment latch relay
on rocket three may he hung up.

588
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:04,261
We have to re-set.
Send back-up command

589
00:57:04,438 --> 00:57:08,519
and update the guidance systems
to account for the delayed firing time.

590
00:57:13,448 --> 00:57:16,200
Co-variance matrix
has been recalculated.

591
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:20,413
All Hercules
back-up syslems are ready.

592
00:58:17,144 --> 00:58:20,478
Attitude correction complete.
Situation nominal.

593
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:23,186
We wait till we see
the whites of its eyes.

594
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,818
0700 Sunday.

595
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:12,791
lt is eight hours since
a splinter struck the Swiss Alps.

596
01:01:12,964 --> 01:01:16,548
Only now has the enormity
of what has happened begun to sink in.

597
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:19,008
There's never been anything like this.

598
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,929
Avalanches and storms
have destroyed whole villages,

599
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:25,426
but nothing on the scale of
what's here.

600
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:27,561
Help is coming from all over,

601
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:31,349
ambulances, helicopters,
rescue equipment and supplies.

602
01:01:31,527 --> 01:01:34,943
Dead casualties are being taken
to churches and town halls.

603
01:01:35,114 --> 01:01:39,243
Those still alive are rushed
to hospitals for resuscitation.

604
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,827
So many skiers and holiday-makers
here atthis time of year,

605
01:01:42,998 --> 01:01:44,955
and many of them are unregistered.

606
01:01:45,125 --> 01:01:48,292
There's no way of telling who they are.

607
01:01:48,462 --> 01:01:50,704
Anyone who has reason to believe

608
01:01:50,882 --> 01:01:55,129
that friends or relatives have been
in this area during the last weeks

609
01:01:55,303 --> 01:01:58,388
should go immediately
to the Swiss emergency offices

610
01:01:58,557 --> 01:02:01,891
that have been opened up
in Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich.

611
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:07,889
The tragedy has been heightened
by the loss of 12,000 contestants

612
01:02:08,067 --> 01:02:13,489
in the cross-country marathon, which
started an hour before the splinter hit.

613
01:02:16,326 --> 01:02:19,992
The cameraman and crew who shot
this film left the area by helicopter

614
01:02:20,164 --> 01:02:22,620
only minutes before the disaster.

615
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:25,627
In the minds of people everywhere,
the question is,

616
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:30,422
where next and what about
the big one due on Sunday,

617
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:33,547
closing on Earth
at 30,000 miles an hour?

618
01:02:34,263 --> 01:02:35,674
We can only hope,

619
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:39,099
as the President of the United States
has assured us,

620
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:41,475
that we are in safe hands.

621
01:02:41,646 --> 01:02:43,520
This is Osman Ragheb in Zurich,

622
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,395
returning you
to the ABC Studios in New York.

623
01:02:48,487 --> 01:02:50,610
My God.

624
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:00,745
As simply as you can, Mr Sherwood.,

625
01:03:00,918 --> 01:03:03,041
what's the procedure now?

626
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:09,626
The satellites are orbiting
with Earth 22,500 miles out in space.

627
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:12,379
Since they are in different orbits,

628
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:15,308
and in order for them
to reach the target together,

629
01:03:15,476 --> 01:03:18,181
they will have to be fired
at different times.

630
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:21,388
Peter the Great first,

631
01:03:21,566 --> 01:03:24,022
and then 40 minutes later, Hercules.

632
01:03:25,028 --> 01:03:27,400
Two hours after that, they will explode

633
01:03:27,572 --> 01:03:30,443
at a designated distance
from the target.

634
01:03:32,495 --> 01:03:34,452
Can anything go wrong?

635
01:03:34,622 --> 01:03:36,247
Well...

636
01:03:38,334 --> 01:03:40,826
...once the rockets have been launched,

637
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:44,872
they switch over to their own
internal decision-making systems.

638
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:49,177
If these systems perform perfectly,
there's no problem.

639
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:51,636
But if there's a malfunction...

640
01:03:51,808 --> 01:03:53,183
What are the odds?

641
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:57,681
Mr President, you know
we've never done this before.

642
01:03:59,066 --> 01:04:00,394
The odds?

643
01:04:03,446 --> 01:04:05,403
Your guess is as good as mine.

644
01:04:05,573 --> 01:04:07,862
If you fail?

645
01:04:08,034 --> 01:04:10,704
The meteor will hit Earth
two hours later.

646
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,999
Hit It Mr Sherwood..

647
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:19,707
Get rid of it.

648
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:20,587
- What is it? What's happened?
- Oh, nothing.

649
01:06:20,765 --> 01:06:24,051
Nothing. I just wondered
if you'd taken time to eat.

650
01:06:25,395 --> 01:06:27,222
Yes, I, uh, had some coffe.

651
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:31,265
That will only make you nervous.
You will do better with food.

652
01:06:31,444 --> 01:06:35,489
You're absolutely right
Let's go eat. That's a pretty scarf.

653
01:06:35,657 --> 01:06:37,484
Thank you.

654
01:06:40,704 --> 01:06:42,495
How many children do you have?

655
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,871
Two. A boy and a girl.

656
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,877
- How do you know I'm married?
- I asked Mr Sherwood..

657
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:51,711
He also told me that you
and your wife are... separated?

658
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,251
I'll have a talk with Mr Sherwood..

659
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,133
I hope you don't mind
that I asked him about you.

660
01:06:57,306 --> 01:07:00,971
No. I would have asked Dr Dubov
about you, but my Russian's limited.

661
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:03,350
- Like some coffe?
- No, thank you.

662
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:05,478
What else you want to know?

663
01:07:05,648 --> 01:07:08,021
It would be too rude to ask.

664
01:07:08,193 --> 01:07:09,817
Ask what you like.

665
01:07:10,821 --> 01:07:13,526
Why are you and your wife separated?

666
01:07:14,617 --> 01:07:18,282
Nothing specific.
It uh, just happened. It's, uh...

667
01:07:19,455 --> 01:07:22,029
No more talks,
no more interests together.

668
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:26,503
It's what we here in America
call, uh, "incompatibility".

669
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,963
That's what we call it in Russia.

670
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:34,378
Yeah. That sounds about right.

671
01:07:36,432 --> 01:07:38,924
- Ever thought of living elsewhere?
- No.

672
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:41,893
- Not often.
- Sometimes?

673
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,138
Well...

674
01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:47,517
You'd like it here.
We've got everything.

675
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:52,274
Power cuts, strikes, unemployment,
race riots and a terrific crime rate.

676
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:56,745
Yamashiro on the Hong Kong monitor
reporting another splinter.

677
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:02,454
Yes, Clark?

678
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:06,579
We've just received a transmission
from a TWA jet over the Pacific.

679
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:10,756
There was an explosion at sea,
heavy enough to knock out two engines.

680
01:08:10,929 --> 01:08:13,421
The plane's heading for Taiwan.

681
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,727
They've reported a tidal wave, 100 feet
high, heading towards Hong Kong.

682
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:48,220
Radar contact with the wave establishes
height stabilized at 100 feet

683
01:08:48,554 --> 01:08:50,962
Speed is constant 600 mlles an hour.

684
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:53,015
Fifteen minutes before it hits us.

685
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:18,089
- Can you hear it?
- Yes! Get out of there.

686
01:11:18,263 --> 01:11:21,098
It's no use. Get the big one, Paul.

687
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:22,641
Get it.

688
01:11:40,788 --> 01:11:45,284
Fifteen minutes from now
the Russian rockets will be launched.

689
01:11:46,586 --> 01:11:51,165
Forty minutes after, our own rockets
will be sent to join them.

690
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:55,505
They will strike the meteor,
sending it into a harmless orbit

691
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,550
nevermore to menace Earth.

692
01:11:58,724 --> 01:12:01,097
It is Sunday.

693
01:12:01,269 --> 01:12:03,558
Stay in your homes.

694
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,141
Have faith.

695
01:12:05,315 --> 01:12:08,020
There is nothing we can do but wait

696
01:12:09,486 --> 01:12:12,690
We will let you know
when the danger has passed.

697
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:29,999
Launch director says go.

698
01:12:30,176 --> 01:12:32,133
We've been cleared to launch.

699
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:35,673
- Clear...
- Roger... Standby for clear release.

700
01:12:38,644 --> 01:12:41,515
Clear. Release on time.

701
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:43,812
You copy? Clear. Release was on?

702
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:46,854
- Autopilot light on.
- Thank you.

703
01:12:50,156 --> 01:12:52,315
Thirty seconds and counting.

704
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,698
Twenty-five seconds.

705
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,662
Zero-six-one-four...

706
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:06,915
Twenty seconds.

707
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:08,752
Engines start.

708
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:11,922
Fifteen seconds.

709
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:14,007
Engines have started.

710
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,804
Ten seconds.

711
01:13:18,772 --> 01:13:21,642
Seven, six, five,

712
01:13:21,817 --> 01:13:24,106
four... three...

713
01:13:24,278 --> 01:13:26,769
Ignition. Blast-off!

714
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:20,872
No problems.
We are on our way.

715
01:14:26,889 --> 01:14:28,597
Miss Donskaya?

716
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,222
Would you please be good enough to
convey my congratulations to Dr Dubov?

717
01:14:40,362 --> 01:14:41,821
My apologies, Bradley.

718
01:14:41,989 --> 01:14:43,947
I was very wrong.

719
01:14:45,785 --> 01:14:48,490
- If there's anything i can do...
- Thank you.

720
01:14:53,085 --> 01:14:55,161
I'll be in my office if you need me.

721
01:15:17,821 --> 01:15:21,024
Hercules
launch minus three minutes.

722
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:24,450
All stations report on readiness.

723
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,028
Power operating at correct levels.

724
01:15:27,206 --> 01:15:28,998
Engine parameters all OK.

725
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:31,124
Hercules targeted correctly...

726
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:35,339
Ground facilities have
conformation Hercules has received

727
01:15:35,507 --> 01:15:37,251
and stored the launch command.

728
01:15:37,426 --> 01:15:40,344
- Yes, Sir Michael?
- I've got some serious news.

729
01:15:40,513 --> 01:15:42,920
- I'd like a word with Dr Bradley.
- Yes, sir.

730
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:44,130
Dr Bradley?

731
01:15:44,308 --> 01:15:46,301
Sir Michael would like to talk to you.

732
01:15:52,901 --> 01:15:55,108
We've picked up another splinter.

733
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:57,272
- A big one.
- Direction?

734
01:15:57,448 --> 01:15:58,942
The United States.

735
01:15:59,117 --> 01:16:01,193
- The eastern seaboard.
- You mean us?

736
01:16:01,369 --> 01:16:03,695
- Near enough.
- Due when?

737
01:16:03,872 --> 01:16:05,948
Just about now.

738
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,003
Can you advance Hercules?

739
01:16:10,171 --> 01:16:11,713
No way.

740
01:16:11,881 --> 01:16:13,292
Stand by.

741
01:16:13,466 --> 01:16:17,215
Coming up
on 90 seconds and counting. Stand by.

742
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:20,930
Mark, 90 seconds.

743
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:23,475
We wait

744
01:16:27,857 --> 01:16:30,479
We don't fire, and we go out of action.

745
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:33,190
The Russian rockets aren't enough.

746
01:16:38,786 --> 01:16:40,245
We wait

747
01:16:48,088 --> 01:16:50,246
Clear. Release on time.

748
01:16:52,468 --> 01:16:54,544
Copy?
Clear. Release was on time.

749
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,805
- 55 seconds.
- Thank you.

750
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,354
Auto pilot light on.

751
01:17:12,198 --> 01:17:14,155
Forty seconds and counting.

752
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:26,078
Thirty seconds and counting.

753
01:17:35,265 --> 01:17:37,223
Twenty seconds.

754
01:17:51,492 --> 01:17:54,065
Seven, six, five,

755
01:17:54,245 --> 01:17:55,739
four...

756
01:17:57,874 --> 01:18:00,626
Ignition.

757
01:22:01,353 --> 01:22:04,473
- God!
- Somebody help me.

758
01:22:04,648 --> 01:22:06,724
Somebody help Manheim.

759
01:22:48,155 --> 01:22:49,898
- You all right?
- I'm all right

760
01:22:50,074 --> 01:22:51,817
But I..I think...

761
01:23:13,892 --> 01:23:16,430
- Let's go.
- Don't worry.

762
01:23:16,603 --> 01:23:20,981
- Help me, please.
- Take a look

763
01:24:28,558 --> 01:24:32,093
This is Ops Chief Goldstone
reporting to Houston.

764
01:24:32,271 --> 01:24:36,732
Motor burns on all rocket engines
for both satellites appear nominal.

765
01:24:40,947 --> 01:24:44,316
Easton again. The situation is A-1.
All rockets functional.

766
01:24:44,493 --> 01:24:46,035
66 minutes to impact.

767
01:24:46,203 --> 01:24:48,112
We'll relay Information.

768
01:24:48,288 --> 01:24:51,622
There's been no contact from New York.
Have you heard?

769
01:24:51,792 --> 01:24:53,370
Nothing from the centre.

770
01:24:53,544 --> 01:24:56,462
The rest of the city's in shambles.

771
01:25:06,308 --> 01:25:07,969
No way.

772
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,778
Dr Bradley, could you come here, please?

773
01:25:55,655 --> 01:25:58,656
Listen, everybody.
Listen carefully.

774
01:25:58,825 --> 01:26:01,447
The exit from the canteen
has been blocked.

775
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:05,618
We can get out through the support room.
We'll need flashlights.

776
01:26:07,835 --> 01:26:10,920
You head up the lead.
I'll pick up the stragglers.

777
01:26:11,089 --> 01:26:13,841
Everybody head for the subway tunnel.

778
01:26:16,553 --> 01:26:19,887
Have you got batteries
for the flashlight?

779
01:26:22,852 --> 01:26:24,263
Here, take this one.

780
01:26:24,437 --> 01:26:26,145
Just take this flashlight.

781
01:26:51,092 --> 01:26:53,761
Come on.
The rest of you stay where you are.

782
01:28:05,633 --> 01:28:07,792
Channel five of Peter the Great

783
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:11,089
indicates number 4 and 7 rockets
have malfunctioned.

784
01:28:11,348 --> 01:28:14,682
Goldstone tracking reports
Peter the Great has lost two.

785
01:28:14,851 --> 01:28:18,600
- How bad is that?
- There's a safety margin of five.

786
01:28:18,773 --> 01:28:22,723
After the rockets join up, they'll
attack the meteor in three waves.

787
01:28:23,361 --> 01:28:26,944
Time to impact 35 minutes, 42 seconds.

788
01:29:54,087 --> 01:29:56,246
- Can we go through?
- Yes.

789
01:29:56,423 --> 01:29:59,543
It's OK but there's a subway car
blocking the tunnel.

790
01:30:00,803 --> 01:30:02,178
Get the others.

791
01:30:33,839 --> 01:30:35,583
It'll be all right

792
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:27,054
Harry, the river's breaking through!

793
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:37,158
Through that car!

794
01:31:37,327 --> 01:31:38,738
Hurry up!

795
01:31:38,912 --> 01:31:40,572
This way, through the car!

796
01:31:47,713 --> 01:31:49,373
Hurry up. Through the car.

797
01:31:50,675 --> 01:31:53,380
Help!

798
01:32:24,921 --> 01:32:28,088
That way!

799
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,312
Come on, come on!

800
01:33:19,649 --> 01:33:21,274
Oh, my God.

801
01:33:27,533 --> 01:33:30,285
It's no use. Get in.

802
01:34:05,658 --> 01:34:07,201
You OK?

803
01:34:09,955 --> 01:34:11,449
Come on.

804
01:34:11,623 --> 01:34:13,082
Come on!

805
01:34:41,949 --> 01:34:44,357
Come on. Fourteen minutes till impact

806
01:34:45,286 --> 01:34:46,780
Fourteen minutes.

807
01:34:58,425 --> 01:34:59,884
Ten degrees.

808
01:35:00,052 --> 01:35:01,844
We're losing one from Hercules.

809
01:35:12,775 --> 01:35:16,642
Time to impact?
Thirteen minutes, 29 seconds.

810
01:35:53,904 --> 01:35:55,279
What was that?

811
01:35:55,447 --> 01:36:01,153
He said one day you will come to Moscow
and you will see a clean subway.

812
01:36:01,329 --> 01:36:03,286
One day I'll take him up on that

813
01:36:09,421 --> 01:36:11,248
How long?

814
01:36:11,882 --> 01:36:13,460
Three minutes.

815
01:36:24,938 --> 01:36:26,812
Two minutes, 50 seconds.

816
01:36:26,982 --> 01:36:30,731
Tracking stations report no more loss.
Keep your fingers crossed.

817
01:36:43,459 --> 01:36:47,753
Helicopters over
the city report tremendous damage.

818
01:36:47,922 --> 01:36:51,505
All local radio and television stations
are not functioning.

819
01:36:51,676 --> 01:36:56,802
Here at WADW in New Jersey, we'll keep
you informed throughout the day.

820
01:36:56,974 --> 01:36:58,349
Any second now.

821
01:39:52,878 --> 01:39:57,208
We're interrupting
our coverage to bring an announcement

822
01:39:57,383 --> 01:39:59,210
just received from Houston.

823
01:39:59,385 --> 01:40:01,627
Three minutes ago at 10.38,

824
01:40:01,804 --> 01:40:05,505
the combined rockets
of the United States and the USSR

825
01:40:05,684 --> 01:40:09,349
struck the meteor, which has
for five days been coming towards us.

826
01:40:09,521 --> 01:40:11,680
The danger is passed.

827
01:40:30,086 --> 01:40:33,171
Quiet down, everybody.
Listen, listen.

828
01:41:26,982 --> 01:41:31,028
With the compliments of the Dodgers.

829
01:41:31,195 --> 01:41:33,272
Dodgers!

830
01:41:33,448 --> 01:41:35,108
Baseball.

830
01:41:36,305 --> 01:41:42,851
