from any one unit.

162
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,540
I gotta assume
my operational security is compromised.

163
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,533
Compromised? Your whole op sec is blown.
You're stone cold dead in the water.

164
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,738
Meanwhile, it does not track.

165
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,651
White supremacist gang?

166
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,221
White prison gangs is tweakers
and meth labs and trailer parks.

167
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,191
Bouncing the old lady around
until they get busted back.

168
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:03,184
And how did they get all high tech
with sophisticated counterintel?

169
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,766
And what we here
talking to you for, anyway?

170
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,759
Miami-Dade wasn't part of the task force.

171
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,006
Oh.

172
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,641
They don't know you.

173
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,510
So, you want to recruit us?

174
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,980
Identify them. Who are they?

175
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,973
-How did they cut into us?
-How do we cut into them?

176
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,420
How do we get
all close and personal with them?

177
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,323
Make a buy. That worked well.

178
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,226
Sell to them? We supply them?

179
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,261
No, they got a steady stream of supply.

180
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,131
Colombian named José Yero,
midlevel trafficker.

181
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,601
Okay. So what about Yero?
Can we get to them through Yero?

182
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,036
-FUJlMA: Possible.
-What does he need?

183
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,071
-Money laundering? Transpo?
-FUJlMA: Transpo.

184
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,807
He outsources his transportation.

185
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,776
Okay.

186
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,769
Do we run an undercover on José Yero?

187
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,385
So we transport a load for Yero
into this group?

188
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,122
So can we run a load for Yero
into this group? It's a question.

189
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,224
He transships out of Haiti.

190
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:09,217
Flies his product in from Colombia,
hires someone to run it from Haiti into here.

191
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,758
This is a FLlR image of someone's
go-fast boats running in a Yero load.

192
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:22,541
AWAC shot it.

193
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,534
That's all we got.

194
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,483
All right. If they do this,

195
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,476
I'd like them deputized as federal under
OCDETF for the purposes of this case.

196
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,322
Fine by me.

197
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,158
Because your op sec is blown,

198
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:43,151
your agency can't know anything about
how they do whatever it is they do.

199
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,855
That's why I came alone. Thank you.

200

Sorry about your men.

Hey, Nicholas, my ace. What's up?

-Sonny. What's up?

Somebody's something's got to go
somewhere, some when.

Not too distant in the future.

Colombian right-wing paramilitaries.

You know who they are?
They are vertically integrated. They are...

You mean, they walk around
with constant erections?

No. They farm, process, produce, export...

SONNY: Any reason
this does not go down?

That's the sound of air rapidly filling
the vacuum created by your departed body.

On account of how fast I remanded your ass
back into custody.

Why is this happening to me?

Because you lead a life of crime.

Aren't you excited to see me?

It's the same fabricated fundamentals
as before.

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,905

275
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:10,909
3-to-5 on assault, Folsom B-wing,

276
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,579
Sonny, Marine Corps,
Chicago, and 10 plus weapons.

277
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,572
Five out of eight, and jumped parole.
Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.

278

And then it goes cold,

279
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,890
'cause presumably you're both too smart
and too fast to get jacked again.

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,092
What about this place?

281
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,195
It'll show up
leased under these aliases.

282
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,596
How'd they test?

283
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,799
-And who tested them?
-Helene in NYPD.

284
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,935
And she worked through
your false identities,

285
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:40,928
and then she found your deeper, hidden,
more criminal selves.

286
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,421
-SONNY: Yeah.
-He's in.

287
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,291
You're on. The meet's in Haiti.

288
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,128
He'll negotiate the price
in person.

289
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,163
Call me after you've landed
in Port-au-Prince,

290
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:49,156
'cause only when you're on the ground
will he tell me where you are to go.

291
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:03,370
Be careful. Be cool.

292
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:22,233
Approaching. Turning to heading 340
down to 6,000 feet.

293
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:26,226
Clear to the lLS runway 1-0
for the approach to Port-au-Prince.

294
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:05,766
Why do I get the feeling everybody knows
we're here 15 blocks out?

295
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:09,937
'Cause everybody knows
we're here 15 blocks out.

So, let's lay it out.

301
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,549
Nicholas say you run a tight group.

302
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,051
That's nice, 'cause we got product
that's got to move.

303
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,587
-Real tight. We move as fast as FedEx.
-Move to where?

304
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,823
To New York, through South Florida.

305
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,358
-SONNY: Move when?
-Right now.

306
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,194
That's kind of all of an instant.

307
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,262
RlCO: That means only one thing, real fast.

308
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,632
So, the price, is it right?

309
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,434
Price is right.

310
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:40,427
But how I know if you any good at this shit?

311
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,643
What's that?

312
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,347
Yeah, your business.
How much volume you do?

313
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,549
Whose product you move?
Who you work with?

314
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,542
Other than Nicholas,
who the fuck knows you?

In return for the risks we took
in recovering your load,

00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,359
Goes very fast.

All right. The secured satellite comms,

Iongs and lats for the transshipment points,
that's all cool.

But I need a vector, not a location.

Ships move, that's why they call them ships.

493

Ship stops, it's trying to impersonate
an apartment building.

At sea, that is very suspicious.
Brings about attention.

that's all bad.

would I be crazy enough
to cut in these gringos like that?
