Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:43,557
For 25 years...

3
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,891
There have been two teams...

4
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,902
Fighting for championship
on all circuits in the world:

5
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:55,204
the "Vaillants" and...

6
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,748
"the leader"

7
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:02,960
the leader, No.13!

8
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,626
Michel Vaillant...

9
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:18,132
It's a incredible fight!

10
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:21,775
70th Le Mans 24 hours race

11
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,425
Michel Vaillant attacks!

12
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,734
Collision!

13
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:23,594
Another fierce collision between the two cars!

14
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:25,998
Michel Vaillant is dead!

15
00:03:27,252 --> 00:03:28,430
Michel!

16
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,675
Michel is in the flames!

17
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:32,658
What happened, dear
Calm down, it will be alright!

18
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:37,615
Michel is healthy and well. Don't worry!

19
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:39,601
Just like the real thing...

20
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,799
Every time you have unpleasant dream, actually nothing happened

21
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,617
Hum...

22
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:49,717
Take it easy

23
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:35,559
Excuse me

24
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:40,585
Hello, Mom

25
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:44,712
Listen to me, firstly, I won't attend Le Mans this year
the car isn't ready

26
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:47,314
Secondly, "The leader" has been racing for 5 years

27
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:50,737
Mom, there is no No. "13" in Le Mans
and never would be

28
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:54,511
He has been standing for a hour,
how come he is not frozen?

29
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,006
Michel seldom freeze,

30
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:00,402
Michel seldom smoke, Michel seldom drink
Michel seldom sleep.

31
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,927
No mom, I'm not angry, I love you,

32
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:05,422
See you later

33
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:07,737
Last year, in "Dakar"

34
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,167
It's 155 Fahrenheit

35
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:13,562
He has been sitting in the car for 3 hours

36
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:16,189
while I talk to some guy on the "Camel"

37
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,615
There he goes!

38
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,618
I'll go get him, I can't believe
we've stayed here for several hours!

39
00:05:23,778 --> 00:05:24,760
All right!

40
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,636
So what did chief said?

41
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,075
The sea wind went strong for 2 monthes

42
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:41,571
So?  We're not go sailing, are we?

43
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:44,229
Strike by sea wave

44
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:45,989
And?

45
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:52,389
Instead of having fresh water ice
We got salt water ice.

46
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,076
What's the diffenernt? We can not eat of it.

47
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:58,405
Salt water ice breaks up stiff!

48
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,912
50 right! Jet!  Left!

49
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,145
200 turn!

50
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,930
Attention!  backwater bend!

51
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,809
Attention!

52
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,405
50 long right!

53
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:23,282
backwater bend! 150

54
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:46,239
Right!

55
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:58,948
Left, turn!

56
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,472
Right! 300!

57
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:02,789
Right?

58
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,933
Beeline!  Crossed!

59
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:37,716
Hurry up!

60
00:07:58,337 --> 00:07:59,744
Now?

61
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:01,275
That's it!

62
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:06,586
Who is behind us?

63
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,285
It's Michel

64
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,115
What are you doing behind us?

65
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:12,347
Because they made a ride
on the froze lake

66
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:14,754
And salty ice is really bad!

67
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,605
What about you?
Why do you dawdle?

68
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,011
That bastard, Cramer!  He is in front of us!

69
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,448
He is blocking us!

70
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:23,906
Let's have fun!

71
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,096
"Jet"

72
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:29,094
May I?

73
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:30,632
Oh, yes, sir!

74
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:32,330
What shall we do next?

75
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,219
Control, 1000!

76
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:34,795
My right hand side!

77
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:36,195
left hand side!

78
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,260
Yes, sir!

79
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:00,469
Get out of here!

80
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,116
Get out of here!

81
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,721
Let's go! Giulio!

82
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,249
You first!

83
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:14,962
Bastards!

84
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,400
You bastards!

85
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:19,742
Sorry, we don't understand french

86
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,117
Sir, clean window for you?

87
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,860
Steve, can you open the window, I feel sick

88
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:53,452
How can you be sick on 2 miles an hour.

89
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,685
Your speed is alright
But your perfume. Haha!

90
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:00,329
Very clever! I really do not stink then
Who said gas smell bad?

91
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:03,146
Go early, arrive early!
That will solve the problem

92
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,490
Keep cool, man!

93
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:07,884
What's the point to get there too early?
Let them wait till the last second

94
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,774
That makes "class"

95
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,174
"Class" means getting there...

96
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:15,310
Son of the bitch!...

97
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,365
He's going to learn my name!

98
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,777
How we suppose to take on time!

99
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,865
Being late is the sign of "real class"?

100
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:28,985
"class"?

101
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:32,343
Is it good that you leave from garden city?

102
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:36,605
Mr. President!
How about smile for me!

103
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,869
Natasha! Oh you shoot me!

104
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,534
You know why I shoot

105
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,354
Thank you! Enjoy yourself

106
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:52,801
I'm fine now

107
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,797
Your lumberjack goes
to the same place we are

108
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,481
"50th RALLY VAN CANADA"

109
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:02,311
There they come!

110
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:17,100
Gabrielle?

111
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,117
Steve? It was you

112
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:24,209
I thought It was a student driver...

113
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,801
I hate "being late is question of 'class'"

114
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:28,497
See you later!

115
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:35,695
They are "The lumberjack" pretty prettier these days

116
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:38,030
This is not over!

117
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:01,818
Michel! Stern! I have reserved a table for you, but hurry up
Otherwise someone else will get that!

118
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,521
Jos? Come on!

119
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,146
Let's take a photo!

120
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,963
No! I have a blood hackle at photographs!

121
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,211
"laugh"

122
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,834
I'm goona have the picture framed

123
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:15,234
And I hang him on in the hall of Drawer Jonquie.

124
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:17,668
Four against one! Cowards!

125
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:19,934
Let's go, or they will pinch our table

126
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,769
Come, David?

127
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:21,894
Be right there, sir

128
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:25,061
It's hard to knot

129
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:27,111
It resembles nowhere.

130
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,085
It's pretty awful.  It's my wife does that.

131
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,553
I absolutely lose without her

132
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:33,675
Where is she?

133
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:36,421
The rally of South-africa.
She is 4th in general.

134
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:37,255
Not bad!

135
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,822
Especially with a car that do not get ahead.

136
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:41,935
If she have a Vaillante she be the first!

137
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,332
Damn it! Have to play it again!

138
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:44,942
See you later!

139
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:46,479
I'll be right there!

140
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:55,983
May I help?

141
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:57,970
Let me see!

142
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:03,097
I am just like your wife, but not

143
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,666
Get out of my way!

144
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,838
Gabrielle Spangenberg!

145
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,629
Sandra Svanson

146
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:26,586
The 2nd place...

147
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,570
Stern Warson and Giulio Cavallo!

148
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:34,627
You are really sexy as you are scared!

149
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,445
You will pay heavily for it!

150
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,727
And then now... the winner of the 11th edition

151
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:44,775
of our rally for the 2nd successive year...

152
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:47,206
Michel Vaillant...

153
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:48,680
And his pilot David Dougherty!

154
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,468
Humble? How can I be any more humble?

155
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,832
I like my best friends winner's pure humility!

156
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:14,227
In fact, if you team up with me ...

157
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,560
You will see how humble I could be.

158
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,013
Are you a female wheel? What beloved!

159
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:22,932
I'd love to have you as my co-driver

160
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:25,298
Actual that's not quite how my imagined things

161
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,931
Oh really? How do you imagine?

162
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:29,788
You know you are beautiful!

163
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:31,252
Thank you

164
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:36,189
Good night

165
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,343
What if I except?

166
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:42,625
Except what?

167
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:44,320
Be your co-driver?

168
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:45,883
5 Right

169
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,798
Straight ahead

170
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,556
2 Left

171
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:55,781
Thank you for walking ... my car, good night

172
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,631
Good night?...just like that?

173
00:14:58,281 --> 00:14:58,848
Hum, yes

174
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:01,088
I have a wonderful evening

175
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,228
You are welcome

176
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:07,589
Let's go to your home. Night is just beginning

177
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:10,117
YOu know?  I'm sorry

178
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:12,642
Good night

179
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:20,751
Oh, Jesus!

180
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,344
Oh? Are you ok!

181
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:24,750
It hurts!

182
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:25,774
I'm sorry!

183
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:27,694
Just I can't stand!

184
00:15:27,989 --> 00:15:29,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

185
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:32,341
The hospital?
No, I hate hospitals!

186
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:37,172
If I can go to your home and have a cup of whisky,
maybe it will be fine, I don't know

187
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,272
It's all wet!

188
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,366
Jesus, why does always rain here

189
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,189
So do bags...

190
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:14,843
Everyone said: The winter is as warm as the summer
in Drawer Jonquie's home, welcome

191
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:17,991
My eautiful Laura!

192
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:21,762
You just keeping on growing!

193
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:24,066
It's raining, I don't hear the car

194
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:25,986
Long time no see

195
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,808
It's wonderful to see you! Michel

196
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:30,470
Here I am, mom!

197
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:32,165
Here is the coffee for everyone

198
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,828
Thank you, madam

199
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,710
Michel, stop playing with your cousin
Listen to me!

200
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,010
Thanks for your coming!

201
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,399
This is important for me
For I have 2 things I want to share with you.

202
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:46,290
I have good news and...

203
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:49,037
I also have the great news!

204
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,243
The Good is that Peugeot called me
today...

205
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,927
and their famous motor "Evolution 5"
is ready and has been promised to us!

206
00:16:58,553 --> 00:16:59,284
When shall we get them?

207
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,440
It should be in May, but he is operational against half June
I.e....

208
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:04,535
for Le Mans!

209
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,379
The 70th Le Mans 24 hours race!

210
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:15,608
That's good news, what's the great news?

211
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:19,446
The great news is for David.
You get a steering wheel for Italy,

212
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:21,372
If you perform well,

213
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,193
with Michel as a team for Le Mans

214
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,149
Henri, do you mind I give you a hug?

215
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,166
This is incredible!

216
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:37,894
Henri! I don't know what to say...

217
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:39,975
This is real the most wonderful day
of my life!

218
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,142
I swear I didn't know about this, mom.

219
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:57,928
What's difference?

220
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:02,412
Look it is not really the first time
that we are gonna take in Le Mans.

221
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,026
But it is well the first time
that I dream so terribly

222
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:09,937
We are being well in Le Mans, but there
still no "the leader" or a no. 13.

223
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,685
Mom, bless me!

224
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:16,208
For David, it's a big day

225
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:20,246
Julie, I wish you were there!

226
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:24,850
YOu will be so proud of me!

227
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,782
What? The weather?

228
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:30,712
It's grand!

229
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,294
And I am happiest man!

230
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,487
What if I take a photograph of them!

231
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:58,367
You were not even born, Natasha!

232
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,474
I know that?
I can dream, can't I?

233
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,195
Le Mans in memory of 70th...

234
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:07,940
Let me introduce to you the latest car nations

235
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:12,068
have known for more than 20 years

236
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,065
"No.13" is the most expected team

237
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,360
And they have Le Mans selected
for their large return.

238
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:23,890
I have it naturally over the team
Of "the leader"!

239
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:28,109
Our team manager, brave Gentleman Cheek

240
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:30,676
Left us 5 years ago

241
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:32,494
Beauty queen Ruth Cheek

242
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:35,824
The daughter of the leader!
She leads her team Malaca

243
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:47,764
Many of you know my father, how stubborn he was

244
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,523
Winning means everything for him.

245
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:55,736
Be ensured, I am my father's daughter!

246
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:01,245
Don't worry

247
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:02,967
Really worry about it!

248
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:06,107
Don't be afraid of your mom's nightmare

249
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:10,205
"The leader"  must take part in Le Mans.
How is that?

250
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:13,666
I hope that the young lady is
more honest than her father is.

251
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:14,756
Calm down!

252
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,290
I'm quite calm!

253
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:19,079
Besides, I am seeking here nothing.
I have things to do!

254
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:21,510
Dad, please!

255
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:24,326
And then now, as we do in every year, we will proceed to auctions

256
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:26,561
as the social works of Le Mans.

257
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:29,573
A. 4,000 Euros for the gloves
of Alain Prost.

258
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,594
4,000, twice. Nobody? ...

259
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:34,375
4,000, third...
Awarded to the young lady!

260
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:38,314
And then now a quite fine piece of
the helmet of Juan Manuel Fangio

261
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,334
Five world champions winner.

262
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:43,114
An exceptional piece. first bid is at 5,000 Euros.
5,000 Euros?

263
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:43,695

264
263
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:44,457

265
264
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:45,771

266
265
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,415

267
266
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:47,505

268
267
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,560

269
268
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:49,906

270
269
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:50,893

271
270
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:52,369

272
271
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:53,972
10000! beauty Queen. Cheek!

273
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:55,855
10000!

274
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:57,397
11000, Michel Vaillant...

275
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,761
12000

276
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:01,401
12000

277
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:02,226
13000

278
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:05,305
13000 once ... 14000 once

279
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,210
14000 twice,

280
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:10,585
15000

281
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,209
Michel Vaillant! 15000 going once

282
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:14,876
Going twice?

283
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:16,440
Anyone else bids?

284
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:17,688
15000

285
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:18,684
25000

286
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:22,042
25000! beauty Queen. Cheek!

287
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:24,893
25000, twice?

288
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:28,869
Michel Vaillant!
26000!

289
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,132
26000, once?

290
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,219
Twice?

291
00:21:33,511 --> 00:21:34,143
30000

292
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,131
30000! beauty Queen. Cheek!

293
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:38,662
Michel Vaillant
How about it?

294
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:41,183
30000

295
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,425
No regret?

296
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:45,535
Are you sure?

297
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,193
Sold to Beauty queen. Cheek!

298
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,691
And then we'll continue to pieces no. 43.

299
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:01,233
The famous Michel Vaillant

300
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:05,649
Le Mans is not begun yet
And you're already losing.

301
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:09,967
Not a good sign, is it

302
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:17,358
Congratulations, Michel. I had never thought
that your helmet of Fangio deserves the amount!

303
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:19,567
Because that's Fangioh

304
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:22,519
It was a good affair. Really great

305
00:22:24,284 --> 00:22:25,015
Actually

306
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:29,049
It's your helmet?

307
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:32,188
Yes, that's what we call "unexpexted"

308
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:42,943
Who is she?

309
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:45,240
A "nightmare"

310
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:03,781
What are you doing totally in the dark?

311
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:09,416
So they are going to race, aren't they?

312
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:11,461
Where is No.13?

313
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:21,935
Henri

314
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:27,345
For 30 years

315
00:23:28,182 --> 00:23:29,010
I have never talked about the affairs

316
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:32,337
But, just for this once, I beg of you:

317
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:34,543
Please don't go through with it!

318
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:37,681
It's impossible

319
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:42,674
Being a champion has nothing to do with the nightmare

320
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,215
Talking about dream

321
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,254
Our dream of Michel, Jean-Pierre and me ...

322
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:49,460
Is the winning in the 24 hour-race of Le Mans

323
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:51,636
I can't do that

324
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:23,781
David who used to be as fast as a rabit

325
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,598
Now becomes a tortoise

326
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,766
Straight down! 120!

327
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:37,128
100! Right!

328
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,831
Turn left! Turn right!

329
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:49,773
What's the matter?

330
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:50,899
I don't know

331
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:51,758
Do you want to stop?

332
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,390
No! Fixed a refuse in the gas!

333
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:57,815
Right! 80!

334
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:03,285
Turn! full gas!

335
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,943
Straight ahead! 320!

336
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,300
Coming!

337
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:15,485
Left! 80!

338
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:26,947
What's wrong?
Why doesn't it run?

339
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,132
100! left!

340
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:40,293
Left! 380!

341
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:51,018
Bridge! 600! David, don't do like a idiot!

342
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:53,286
Override him!

343
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,487
Bridge! Override them!

344
00:25:57,906 --> 00:25:58,854
Bridge! 150!

345
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:03,953
Stop! Danger!

346
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:06,411
Bridge!

347
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:08,788
Bridge!

348
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,925
Stop!

349
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:18,127
You are cought!

350
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,042
David!

351
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,703
Are you ok!

352
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:47,363
Damn! Can't go out!

353
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:53,283
Ok!

354
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:55,678
We're not gonna let Cramer take it!

355
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:58,755
Go, hurry up!

356
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:01,506
Tell Michel to "catch up with them"!

357
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:06,214
You are alright?

358
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:07,883
Good

359
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:12,485
That is Giulio!

360
00:27:16,016 --> 00:27:17,161
Vehicle is damaged!

361
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:18,089
How about David?

362
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:20,072
He is intact

363
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:32,369
Michel!

364
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:34,513
Michel, stand aside!

365
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:46,810
Danger!

366
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:49,974
Stand aside!

367
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,095
David!

368
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,489
Stand aside!

369
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:35,773
I'm Michel

370
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,088
I know who you are

371
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:44,392
Thanks for your coming all these way

372
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:47,655
You mean a lot to david

373
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:53,546
Maybe he looks on you as family

374
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:55,848
He meant a lot to us, too

375
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,385
This is Jean-Pierre, my brother.

376
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:03,598
And Steve Warson.

377
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:11,827
Father has asked for appologise for not able to being here
It's really a lot to him

378
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:13,426
I know

379
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:19,252
We want you to know, if there is anything you need

380
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,066
We will all be here with you

381
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:27,506
I've heard about Le Mans

382
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:37,915
That's his child dream...

383
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:38,095
time?

384
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:40,459
1 minute and 24 seconds

385
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:42,063
And is that good?

386
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,186
Good for the cars

387
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,242
What do you mean by that?

388
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,651
9 seconds slower than the job recorded.
That is the same as 9 light-years.

389
00:32:54,713 --> 00:32:57,431
You must try hard to win

390
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,476
Currently it's hard to win

391
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:02,549
Idiot!

392
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:04,666
Maybe it's because of the car

393
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:11,805
Listen! We have a contract...

394
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,652
Shut up!

395
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:16,635
Get out of here!

396
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:06,826
You could wait for me at office

397
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:09,036
I am too curious.
I had to see the studio.

398
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:10,740
David has spoken about it a lot...

399
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:13,871
Come on

400
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,155
Is that Michel?

401
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:21,782
No, it's me

402
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:23,378
You were a driver?

403
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:26,004
Hundreds of years ago.

404
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:29,656
Don't you miss it?

405
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,908
My parents have 2 sons...

406
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:38,072
And I'm the one brakes more slowly
than the other...

407
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:42,105
Is the application still in effect?

408
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,576
Of course, Julia? What can I do for you

409
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,608
I'd like to have my husband's place.
I wanna drive for Le Mans!

410
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:53,917
Now only less than 24 hours remains

411
00:34:54,376 --> 00:34:55,204
Look at this!

412
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:03,944
Who is that?

413
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:05,539
Julie Wood

414
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:08,044
Not bad at all!

415
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:10,760
She said she want to replace David in Le Mans!

416
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:13,098
Have you said yes to her?

417
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:14,408
I said no

418
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:17,647
I've already tested 2 persons who can replace David

419
00:35:17,938 --> 00:35:19,694
Why shall we let her in?

420
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:23,567
Just want her to test

421
00:35:24,085 --> 00:35:25,841
To see her ability is limited

422
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:30,868
How much?

423
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:32,050
55 seconds

424
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:33,424
55 seconds 9

425
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:37,110
The first result is not bad!

426
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,377
Come on!

427
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,698
How are you doing?

428
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:49,373
I pilot her around the track!

429
00:35:55,297 --> 00:35:57,053
Michel here, are you ok?

430
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:58,783
Fine!

431
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:02,813
Since don't know the track very well.
I've got to give me 2, 3 points?

432
00:36:03,557 --> 00:36:04,124
I know that!

433
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:05,501
Follow me!

434
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,769
Big turn!

435
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,702
Left! right!  tempo 5!

436
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,353
Tempo 6!

437
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:20,226
Big turn! Along the stone!

438
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,023
Accelerate at the exit!

439
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:29,508
Your turn!

440
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,607
No problem!

441
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,651
Left 160R!

442
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,288
Go in!

443
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:42,321
Do it yourself!

444
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:46,604
Yourself!

445
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:58,481
What's the guy doing?

446
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:01,039
What's up?

447
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,122
Because if we promise her,
she will try her best anyway

448
00:37:06,334 --> 00:37:08,701
Julia wants to race in memory of David
that's not enough

449
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:12,156
"want to try" is really uncommon

450
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:13,878
Besides, the stopwatch will give you equal chance.

451
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:16,250
The job record is 51"1

452
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:19,450
Let us assume that they get it within 4 seconds
then they really stand a chance to win!

453
00:37:22,628 --> 00:37:25,149
I give wants her 3 seconds as they usually get.

454
00:37:25,669 --> 00:37:27,131
Great! 3 second!

455
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,466
53"9!

456
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:51,629
That is less than 3 sec.

457
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,150
I see, please let me set up a team with Cavallo.

458
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,554
I understand

459
00:38:05,813 --> 00:38:06,282
So?

460
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:08,368
It is not too good

461
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:11,951
But, you and your brother have an agreement on...

462
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,591
Look, no favors ok.

463
00:38:17,274 --> 00:38:19,184
If I'm not good enough, just tell me!

464
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:20,051
Julie

465
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,373
Your results is less than 3 seconds

466
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:26,170
Really?

467
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:27,191
I'm sure This is for you

468
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,750
Welcome to the team Vaillants!

469
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:32,377
Thanks!

470
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:33,784
Well done!

471
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:38,046
Thank you!

472
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:55,366
Stop!

473
00:38:57,258 --> 00:38:58,600
Drawer Jonquie?

474
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:02,155
Yes, all 3 generations live here

475
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:05,060
And around this house
I rode my first car.

476
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:06,087
How old was you then?

477
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:06,949

478
477
00:39:07,246 --> 00:39:10,116
Laura! Stop!

479
00:39:10,351 --> 00:39:12,424
Stop! can't you hear!

480
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:17,166
Michel, do something! Don't just stand there!

481
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:17,863
Be right back!

482
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,056
Uncle Michel!

483
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:25,457
Quite good, Laura!

484
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,349
Really

485
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:29,686
You must look ahead when you drive the car

486
00:39:29,944 --> 00:39:31,286
Stop!

487
00:39:31,544 --> 00:39:33,519
Brake

488
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:34,520
You two!

489
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:38,869
Hum! Good!
Turn left slowly

490
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:42,034
You brake softly

491
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,926
And stop at the gate.

492
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:46,261
But I can't reach the pedals

493
00:39:48,383 --> 00:39:51,613
Ok, turn left slowly

494
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:54,872
At the gate, stop at the driveway

495
00:39:55,106 --> 00:39:57,278
Brake slowly

496
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:00,506
Great!

497
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:03,293
Julie, This is Laura, the daughter of Jean-Pierre.

498
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:06,046
You are great, Laura.

499
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:10,272
Henri Vaillant, the grandfather of the child who commands me

500
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,854
Before learning to drive
I want you to learn to obey!

501
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,615
I can drive already

502
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,987
Well! Then then only thing you need to learn is to obey!

503
00:40:27,663 --> 00:40:30,533
The insurance company understands but don't know
what causes the explosion

504
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:35,019
We have carry the wreck here to let Jos have a look

505
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,562
Jos, what do you think?

506
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:43,955
Proteus crystals.

507
00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:48,239
Which let the vehicle lose control

508
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,496
Basically there is no danger if it's in the gasonline tank

509
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:56,788
Only when the vehicle runs in the match,
the crystal reach the electric circuits

510
00:40:57,018 --> 00:40:58,578
Then....Bang

511
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:10,965
So how does this crystal get in his gasoline tank?

512
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,087
I don't know

513
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,063
Who put it?

514
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:47,848
This id Gabrielle Steve, this is you

515
00:41:48,398 --> 00:41:50,308
This is Giulio

516
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:53,934
He brakes at the 85 meters in the front

517
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:56,231
That imprint is the mark

518
00:41:56,658 --> 00:41:59,593
If it's downwind, 85 meters is too short

519
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:03,466
So he go straight ahead

520
00:42:04,214 --> 00:42:04,912
And where are you?

521
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,645
Here

522
00:42:14,778 --> 00:42:16,087
You see the forest?

523
00:42:16,474 --> 00:42:20,020
This time of the year there are many falling leaves
and keep the air cool.

524
00:42:20,347 --> 00:42:24,626
The temperature is thus lower here,
the air is more density

525
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:28,348
So it's easy to brake

526
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:31,478
Zig and Zag?

527
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:33,208
So it does

528
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:48,899
Then what about other circuits?

529
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,526
It's from ancestors'...

530
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:53,956
wisdom

531
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:56,414
How is the currently tyre imprint?

532
00:42:56,714 --> 00:42:58,951
Good

533
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:03,499
Le Mans will start tomorrow
What do we need now?

534
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,665
Hamburgers! My treat

535
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,300
What do you say?

536
00:43:09,776 --> 00:43:10,343
Great!

537
00:43:11,664 --> 00:43:12,679
Let's go!

538
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,050
Go!

539
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:04,925
Taste like my hometown...

540
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:10,401
Turn right at the 6th crossing
Straight 200 sign, then turn left

541
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:14,658
You've been in the curcuit for over one hundred times
You should know it well

542
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:19,904
Entrance of the stadium.
Sturdy right, in 2.

543
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:22,660
Brake softly, turn left

544
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:24,869
Rush

545
00:44:25,678 --> 00:44:28,100
Yes! understand!

546
00:44:28,687 --> 00:44:30,181
I know it by heart!

547
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,098
That means with the eyes closed.

548
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:35,211
It's impossible.

549
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,354
Why must you say that?

550
00:44:43,638 --> 00:44:44,139
Where is he going?

551
00:44:45,365 --> 00:44:46,794
Just follow him

552
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:01,333
Where to go?

553
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:11,578
Cover my eyes with your hands

554
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:15,966
Are you sure?

555
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:22,847
Just told me at the 100 signs

556
00:45:25,062 --> 00:45:26,077
Ready?

557
00:45:27,078 --> 00:45:28,158
Go

558
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:42,123
Sign!

559
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,405
Michel!

560
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:48,201
Sign!

561
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:56,042
Slow down! Sign!

562
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:08,818
Alright!

563
00:46:09,879 --> 00:46:10,260
Sign!

564
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:15,381
Watch out! Sign!

565
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,198
Brake...Sign!

566
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:21,365
Sign!

567
00:46:31,776 --> 00:46:32,539
Are you okay!

568
00:46:57,163 --> 00:46:58,111
Goodbye

569
00:47:11,504 --> 00:47:12,616
What's up?

570
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,003
Don't go to Le Mans

571
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:25,457
Sorry, dear

572
00:47:26,551 --> 00:47:29,552
I hope my worry is wrong

573
00:47:31,672 --> 00:47:32,620
I hope so

574
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:35,252
I hope you are safe

575
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,195
Damn!

576
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:23,879
No signal!

577
00:48:24,206 --> 00:48:27,469
Welcome to the qualify run for the
70th anniversary of 24 hours of Le Mans

578
00:48:27,727 --> 00:48:32,071
"The leader" returns to the match

579
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:36,713
It is indeed their first participation since...

580
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:40,809
...The passing on of Gentleman Cheek.

581
00:48:41,045 --> 00:48:44,079
The leader carry the numbers 13 and 22.

582
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:48,370
We are expecting the their duel with the Vaillantes

583
00:48:50,104 --> 00:48:53,683
I've just been told that the Vaillantes is not ready yet

584
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:56,277
Hopefully it goes well

585
00:48:58,396 --> 00:49:00,731
But what happened? Where is the car?

586
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,193
Jos has not called me.

587
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:06,007
Why didn't they carry it yesterday?

588
00:49:06,494 --> 00:49:10,750
Afraid of being breaking

589
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:12,797
That's Jos's judgement

590
00:49:13,057 --> 00:49:13,853
Really strange!

591
00:49:14,562 --> 00:49:16,984
The vehicle is sent 3 hours ago

592
00:49:17,283 --> 00:49:18,363
Where is Jos's handphone?

593
00:49:18,596 --> 00:49:20,898
It will be 2 hours 5 minutes later

594
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:26,172
If the vehicle is not around in one hour
it is disqualified for the race!

595
00:49:33,033 --> 00:49:34,080
We can get contact with them

596
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:43,331
Jos!

597
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:45,932
I can't hear! Speak louder!

598
00:49:46,255 --> 00:49:47,270
Where are you?

599
00:49:47,503 --> 00:49:48,201
What?

600
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:54,568
Where?

601
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:11,765
Where!

602
00:50:36,803 --> 00:50:38,013
We got 18 minutes for 60 kilo!

603
00:50:38,276 --> 00:50:38,941
No problem!

604
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:51,590
2 cars come together

605
00:50:51,977 --> 00:50:54,366
Watch out!  the circuit!

606
00:51:10,992 --> 00:51:13,960
You have yet 15 minutes

607
00:51:14,194 --> 00:51:16,464
They are coming

608
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:17,104
Coming?

609
00:51:17,363 --> 00:51:18,573
Yes

610
00:51:18,836 --> 00:51:21,225
If you let her in via the Porsche-curve
Can they yet make a launched round

611
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:24,592
Please!

612
00:51:25,494 --> 00:51:28,080
I can't imagine a Le Mans race without Vaillants

613
00:51:29,176 --> 00:51:29,874
Give them a chance

614
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:38,106
Open the 8th gate!

615
00:51:38,843 --> 00:51:42,903
They must run a round in allowed time!

616
00:52:14,954 --> 00:52:16,962
Still no Vaillants's car!

617
00:52:17,227 --> 00:52:21,669
15 minutes left or they are disqualitified

618
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,600
It's emergency, the helicopter will pay you

619
00:52:45,047 --> 00:52:47,186
Does helicopter also need fuel?

620
00:52:47,479 --> 00:52:48,046
I doubt it

621
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:03,252
56"!

622
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:05,109
55"!

623
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,355
54"!

624
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:09,754
Vaillants's car rushs into the circuit!

625
00:53:09,984 --> 00:53:11,577
From gate 8!

626
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,378
Faster!

627
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:53,128
That's on time!

628
00:53:54,066 --> 00:53:55,822
They are qualified!

629
00:53:56,819 --> 00:53:58,575
Vaillants

630
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,513
Find another way

631
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:09,012
It's 10pm

632
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:14,168
It's the beginning of the night performance.

633
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,696
Time is 2 hours

634
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,432
Tyre...

635
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:30,296
That's alright

636
00:54:30,592 --> 00:54:32,250
What happened this afternoon?

637
00:54:34,114 --> 00:54:35,390
Photographer?

638
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,381
Yes, how is it?

639
00:54:36,675 --> 00:54:38,847
Just take photos, don't ask question! Ok?

640
00:54:46,215 --> 00:54:47,677
the American Steve Warson...

641
00:54:48,008 --> 00:54:50,430
Want to replace Gabrielle Spangenberg

642
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,944
Changing driver for the No. 10 Vaillants!

643
00:55:50,177 --> 00:55:51,704
Julie...

644
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:54,871
Now ¡°Laura¡± 's Schneid...

645
00:55:55,139 --> 00:55:58,555
Lead temporarily, 3 minutes 32 seconds 843,

646
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:20,804
It's yours?

647
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:22,629
Don't leave your dog running around

648
00:56:28,688 --> 00:56:31,241
Seems at the time of changing tyre

649
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,559
It's possible that someone destructs

650
00:56:40,853 --> 00:56:41,485
Where is the vehicle?

651
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:44,529
"The leader" doesn't show up yet

652
00:56:44,854 --> 00:56:46,130
But Cramer wasn't there.

653
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:47,373
Where is the truck?

654
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:48,109
Attacked?

655
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,677
It's not my fault

656
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:58,227
That's it for tonight.

657
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,435
Good night, see you tomorrow

658
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:12,888
Seems I come at right time.

659
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:15,002
What's up?

660
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:29,282
I come to appologize for her

661
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:30,885
Really kind

662
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:34,981
She would do anything for me!

663
00:57:39,692 --> 00:57:40,226
Do you know about me?

664
00:57:40,813 --> 00:57:43,847
Who is for you?

665
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:49,927
Thank you!

666
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:53,547
I look on that as a compliment.

667
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:58,643
What can I do to make it up?

668
00:58:03,254 --> 00:58:04,202
Michel!

669
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,667
The setting you mentioned...

670
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:47,649
Good evening, Mr. Vaillant!

671
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:15,951
Soory, I wanted to talk to you last night.
I must falling asleep

672
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:18,411
Me too...

673
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,129
Excuse me

674
00:59:22,998 --> 00:59:25,170
Calm down, Speak slowly

675
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:30,706
Disappeared?

676
00:59:34,907 --> 00:59:36,052
Oh, no, mom...

677
00:59:36,763 --> 00:59:38,519
He slept next to the door

678
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,632
He was tired...

679
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:43,901
He will call you as soon as he is awake

680
00:59:44,382 --> 00:59:47,001
I love you, too, bye!

681
00:59:49,409 --> 00:59:50,424
Is something wrong?

682
01:00:13,354 --> 01:00:14,150
Where is my father?

683
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:16,487
Good morning!

684
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,306
Answer me in 10 seconds!

685
01:00:19,212 --> 01:00:20,160
Threats?

686
01:00:20,397 --> 01:00:22,853
Michel, you insult me!

687
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,932
I was here the whole night.

688
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,665
But if you don't believe me...

689
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:37,225
Now, to answer your question

690
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,745
Yes, I do know where your father is

691
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:44,307
He is very well

692
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:46,258
But if go to the police...

693
01:00:47,384 --> 01:00:50,134
now...

694
01:00:50,457 --> 01:00:51,439
He dies

695
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:54,201
You win Le Mans, he dies

696
01:00:54,683 --> 01:00:57,050
You don't race, he dies

697
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,403
The only way you see your father live again
is you race and lose

698
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,794
I want you to know what's humiliation

699
01:01:05,054 --> 01:01:07,443
what's loss

700
01:01:21,926 --> 01:01:25,407
Good morning, welcome
to the 24 hours of Le Mans

701
01:01:25,703 --> 01:01:29,982
Bravo at the early birds.

702
01:01:30,249 --> 01:01:33,894
It will be quite a long day today

703
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:36,584
I'm really sorry, Michel

704
01:01:37,804 --> 01:01:39,943
I relaxed...

705
01:01:40,205 --> 01:01:43,402
and drank a cup or two, so...

706
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:46,955
Are you angry?

707
01:01:48,784 --> 01:01:51,240
Last night, Ruth kidnap my father

708
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:55,474
You are her witness of not being there

709
01:01:57,364 --> 01:01:59,885
She asked me to race and lose
That's the deal...

710
01:02:01,654 --> 01:02:02,832
I can't believe it?

711
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,595
I'm gonna have a word with this bitch!

712
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:07,311
Just forget about it!
We are talking about my father's life!

713
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,805
Lose "The leader" in purpose, is it ok?

714
01:02:13,466 --> 01:02:14,993
Don't do that!

715
01:02:15,323 --> 01:02:17,625
We have no choice, catch the time!

716
01:02:19,197 --> 01:02:20,691
Time to think

717
01:02:21,149 --> 01:02:23,157
As soon as we have the solution
We come in action!

718
01:02:31,778 --> 01:02:33,240
You may count on me.

719
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:19,408
Michel

720
01:03:21,045 --> 01:03:24,395
I want to say thank you

721
01:03:24,663 --> 01:03:26,125
for David and for me as well

722
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:28,881
See you later

723
01:06:07,448 --> 01:06:10,132
The green flag waved...

724
01:06:10,457 --> 01:06:12,148
The cars startup then...

725
01:06:12,442 --> 01:06:15,672
for a complete round in the order...

726
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:45,058
That they acquired during the qualified positions....

727
01:06:45,351 --> 01:06:48,069
and then the 70th 24 hourse of Le Mans begins!

728
01:06:48,424 --> 01:06:50,912
We are going to watch a fierce battle!

729
01:07:31,962 --> 01:07:34,101
Vaillants doesn't attack

730
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:36,503
Seems there is a problem

731
01:07:47,456 --> 01:07:48,863
That's...

732
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:51,740
Vaillants is overdriving?

733
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,714
No, not yet!

734
01:08:11,402 --> 01:08:13,060
Keep eyes on the situations!

735
01:08:28,977 --> 01:08:31,978
What's going on? We really try our best
from the first rounds?

736
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:32,744
I wish I knew

737
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,080
Michel, is there any problem?

738
01:08:35,572 --> 01:08:36,400
Everything is cool.

739
01:08:38,453 --> 01:08:41,934
So what's up with the hero?

740
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,558
Take a photo of "the leader" also!

741
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:45,969
Okay. stand aside!

742
01:08:46,264 --> 01:08:48,468
It's strange!

743
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,742
The 2 cars put on their seeds at
the same moment

744
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:57,076
It's rare

745
01:08:57,309 --> 01:09:01,020
It's rare that 2 cars put on their seeds at
the same moment

746
01:09:08,705 --> 01:09:09,915
What's happened?

747
01:09:10,242 --> 01:09:11,704
I hit bricks on the track

748
01:09:29,193 --> 01:09:32,227
Vaillants and Cramer...

749
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,728
Cooperate with each other

750
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:39,019
Change tyre!

751
01:09:39,502 --> 01:09:40,811
Change tyre!

752
01:09:46,096 --> 01:09:48,300
Vaillants is still in the seed

753
01:10:17,629 --> 01:10:19,604
Change! Come on!

754
01:10:19,869 --> 01:10:20,632
When would you change the tyre?

755
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:23,162
Move the tyre in it!

756
01:10:31,234 --> 01:10:33,209
Cramer leaves the seed...

757
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:36,924
Oddly enough Michel Vaillant makes
no use of this advantage.

758
01:10:37,221 --> 01:10:40,320
We let him win seconds
and he forfeits it

759
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:29,142
Wait for me outside!

760
01:11:33,435 --> 01:11:34,613
Well then, Henri?

761
01:11:35,932 --> 01:11:37,142
How do you like the show?

762
01:11:42,654 --> 01:11:45,884
I know you love your son

763
01:11:46,144 --> 01:11:47,900
Why do you do that?

764
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:52,957
For my father

765
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,028
I watch him suffer the whole life because of you

766
01:11:56,549 --> 01:11:58,938
As a child, I suffered from seeing my father like that

767
01:11:59,493 --> 01:12:03,171
Now Michel and you will precisely feel
what we have felt for years

768
01:12:04,936 --> 01:12:07,238
For your childhood, I'm sorry

769
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,840
But the truth is that your father
is a cheater. He always a cheater.

770
01:12:12,971 --> 01:12:15,557
And I think you are more despicable than he is

771
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:20,331
Don't be your father, just be be yourself!

772
01:12:20,942 --> 01:12:24,423
Let me go home, I'll forget those unhappy things

773
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,126
Impossible!

774
01:12:42,935 --> 01:12:44,397
Steve, waht's up?

775
01:12:44,696 --> 01:12:46,638
Why do you stay behind "the leader"?

776
01:12:46,873 --> 01:12:49,045
Are you afraid of speeding?

777
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:52,849
Of course not. Everything is okay.
It is a long race.

778
01:12:53,212 --> 01:12:55,187
That's ok

779
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:10,398
Michel, you owe me an explanation...

780
01:13:12,899 --> 01:13:14,077
What's the earth going on there?

781
01:13:37,644 --> 01:13:39,204
Everything ok?

782
01:13:43,183 --> 01:13:43,848
So what do we do?

783
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:50,861
Send Julie to come here

784
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:58,348
What's up?

785
01:13:58,677 --> 01:14:00,084
Don't ask anything!

786
01:14:00,598 --> 01:14:02,005
I need you to do me a big favor

787
01:14:02,262 --> 01:14:02,763
What does it mean?

788
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:04,241
I want you to take my place!

789
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,672
Take you place?

790
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:08,240
What for!

791
01:14:10,522 --> 01:14:11,602
Take your place?

792
01:14:11,835 --> 01:14:14,770
One hour is enough
only Jean-Pierre knows.

793
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:18,905
Can I count on you, Julie?

794
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:25,272
Thank you!

795
01:14:49,354 --> 01:14:51,624
"58 kilo"

796
01:14:54,444 --> 01:14:56,681
a water castle Saint-Andreaskruis...

797
01:14:58,702 --> 01:14:59,717
Good evening...

798
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:03,562
Nice to see you again

799
01:15:09,874 --> 01:15:11,630
I caught him in your car.

800
01:15:13,235 --> 01:15:15,919
Back into the seeds of ...

801
01:15:16,693 --> 01:15:17,489
the leader of Bob Cramer!

802
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:22,125
What's happened there?
He seems have hit something undoubtedly.

803
01:15:22,423 --> 01:15:26,647
Someone helps him out from his car.
His sight is piece.

804
01:15:26,905 --> 01:15:29,294
He will undoubtedly let Boorman take his place

805
01:15:35,836 --> 01:15:37,178
What are you doing here?

806
01:15:37,501 --> 01:15:38,297
What's happened?

807
01:15:39,102 --> 01:15:40,050
Accident, A Pigeon.

808
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:48,190
You must win...

809
01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:49,851
"the leader"!

810
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,664
Michel...

811
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:17,706
Anyway, I have to tell you...

812
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,818
There is something happening

813
01:16:21,487 --> 01:16:22,894
It has nothing to do with me

814
01:16:25,968 --> 01:16:28,521
It's Cramer who put the crystal in the David's car...

815
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:32,718
He wa just slowing him down...

816
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:35,024
The accident...

817
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,107
Be careful

818
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:46,319
What are you doing?

819
01:16:46,744 --> 01:16:50,007
Drivers change, and it is Cramer

820
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:51,695
Show up again!

821
01:16:52,187 --> 01:16:53,267
Quick!

822
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:58,778
Ruth herself...

823
01:16:59,134 --> 01:17:01,852
commands

824
01:17:02,943 --> 01:17:03,771
Go now race and win!

825
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,429
Be a good child your father like!

826
01:17:09,634 --> 01:17:10,266
Bye!

827
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:20,420
Michel of Vaillantes shows up again!

828
01:17:20,839 --> 01:17:22,246
Julie, have a rest!

829
01:17:55,829 --> 01:17:57,171
Slow down!

830
01:18:13,212 --> 01:18:14,357
Vaillant!

831
01:18:16,701 --> 01:18:17,813
Why are you here, mom?

832
01:18:18,045 --> 01:18:21,177
I don't want stay at home alone,
so I'm coming

833
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,170
Oh...

834
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,739
Where is your father?

835
01:18:24,095 --> 01:18:25,622
Over there

836
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,342
He said he wants to listen to the sound of motor...

837
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:32,477
I accompany you

838
01:18:33,924 --> 01:18:36,925
No, I just have a sit

839
01:18:37,734 --> 01:18:38,879
Danger!

840
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:41,532
Don't worry, I can take care of myself!

841
01:18:42,695 --> 01:18:44,004
Be back soon, ok?

842
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:39,932
Vaillants attacks!

843
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:43,606
Seems want to break away from Cramer

844
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:51,838
The two cars hit each other!

845
01:19:53,092 --> 01:19:54,619
A furious fight

846
01:19:55,044 --> 01:19:55,425
What happened?

847
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:56,862
What's up?

848
01:20:05,288 --> 01:20:06,750
They hit again!

849
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:10,886
It loses control

850
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,960
But after an escapade on the grass, "the leader"
succeeds finding its way back!

851
01:20:21,711 --> 01:20:23,053
How come!

852
01:20:28,626 --> 01:20:30,961
But Michel Vaillant is again
in the attack of "the leader"!

853
01:20:52,955 --> 01:20:53,270
Bill!

854
01:20:55,773 --> 01:20:56,242
Mom!

855
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:02,618
A horrible collision!
The Vaillante flies away!

856
01:22:39,143 --> 01:22:40,288
Stand aside!

857
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,320
It's me, look, it's me!

858
01:22:46,953 --> 01:22:48,065
It's me! Julie!

859
01:22:56,717 --> 01:22:59,980
Yet no news about the health ...

860
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:01,994
of Bob Cramer and Michel Vaillant

861
01:23:02,288 --> 01:23:04,393
a dreadful accident...

862
01:23:22,712 --> 01:23:24,916
I know where my father is! Let's go!

863
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,309
Mom!

864
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:35,859
Michel!

865
01:23:36,285 --> 01:23:37,943
I'm alright, don't worry!

866
01:23:38,302 --> 01:23:39,862
Nor hurt

867
01:23:40,414 --> 01:23:41,876
Where is my father?

868
01:23:42,272 --> 01:23:43,646
I'm on the way getting him

869
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:47,614
Great!

870
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,180
Oh my children!

871
01:24:11,019 --> 01:24:13,987
Ah, my children...

872
01:24:14,284 --> 01:24:15,626
Gabrielle Spangenberg has already
sit there for almost 4 hours

873
01:24:15,949 --> 01:24:17,957
If no reasons...

874
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:20,939
no qualification for the race

875
01:24:37,493 --> 01:24:40,876
Final! He is totally alone.
The others are far behind.

876
01:24:55,773 --> 01:24:57,017
Come on!

877
01:24:58,078 --> 01:24:59,093
Come on!

878
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:01,560
Come on!

879
01:25:02,655 --> 01:25:04,630
Come on! Get on the car!

880
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,267
Are you ok?

881
01:25:14,788 --> 01:25:15,289
Fine!

882
01:25:15,621 --> 01:25:16,897
A bit sick

883
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:18,242
Let me see!

884
01:25:19,559 --> 01:25:20,257
Shit!

885
01:25:22,056 --> 01:25:26,018
Jaguar no. 30 goes faster and faster!

886
01:25:26,313 --> 01:25:30,689
Half an hour left, Boorman,
no. 22 of "The leader" takes the leaderhip

887
01:25:33,388 --> 01:25:34,500
Be careful

888
01:25:37,325 --> 01:25:37,772
Alright?

889
01:25:38,094 --> 01:25:40,429
It goes well. Besides, we have no choice.

890
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:42,247
Let'go!

891
01:25:48,338 --> 01:25:49,745
Slow down...

892
01:25:50,035 --> 01:25:50,536
Noway!

893
01:25:50,835 --> 01:25:54,698
Only 15 minutes left, can't stop!

894
01:25:58,390 --> 01:25:59,121
Michel!

895
01:26:02,103 --> 01:26:03,630
Second in the racers that is
behind "the leader", ...

896
01:26:03,928 --> 01:26:07,955
is the Vaillante no. 8

897
01:26:08,186 --> 01:26:11,482
3 minutes difference

898
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:12,695
Your body-guard!

899
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:17,272
Hopefully you ring me with a good reason.

900
01:26:23,456 --> 01:26:24,601
I believe you.

901
01:27:04,849 --> 01:27:06,988
And it is racer no. 8, Steve Warson

902
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:11,439
The American must catch up with "the leader" for 3 minutes
And 12 seconds

903
01:27:51,747 --> 01:27:55,130
Warson improves...

904
01:27:55,493 --> 01:27:56,671
Pulverizes the job record!

905
01:28:19,023 --> 01:28:20,452
Leaky tyre for Steve Warson!

906
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:25,159
What happened?

907
01:28:27,282 --> 01:28:28,264
Can you ride yet?

908
01:28:49,851 --> 01:28:50,679
No oil!

909
01:28:51,131 --> 01:28:52,887
Shit! Incredible!

910
01:29:05,057 --> 01:29:08,058
"The leasers" is just one step away from the victory!

911
01:29:08,355 --> 01:29:10,046
Slow down in the front of the terminal!

912
01:29:10,403 --> 01:29:11,712
Stand aside!

913
01:29:35,757 --> 01:29:37,219
Get off and push it!

914
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:38,565
Go away!

915
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:58,897
We must win anyway!

916
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:07,411
Cheer up!

917
01:30:14,717 --> 01:30:15,699
Hurry!

918
01:30:15,934 --> 01:30:17,723
I must win!

919
01:30:38,215 --> 01:30:39,775
Warson wins !

920
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,496
The 70th 24 hours of Le Mans ends now!

921
01:31:27,034 --> 01:31:28,528
Can go to the stage?

922
01:31:29,371 --> 01:31:31,990
Oh yes. You let me do
the most difficult work

923
01:31:32,284 --> 01:31:33,658
But let me have a try

924
01:31:40,415 --> 01:31:42,171
I have somewhat the impression that...

925
01:31:44,257 --> 01:31:45,883
You take away the victory

926
01:31:47,746 --> 01:31:50,943
In my place, you will do it, too

927
01:31:54,341 --> 01:31:54,842
Of course!

928
01:31:58,246 --> 01:31:59,261
So everything is cool!

929
01:32:05,001 --> 01:32:06,016
How is your feeling?

930
01:32:06,314 --> 01:32:08,224
Great! I think that I will come back!

931
01:32:29,267 --> 01:32:31,689
Congratulations to you!

932
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:09,339
Would you help me to hold it, sweetheart? Oh really!

933
01:33:09,571 --> 01:33:10,367
Ah

952
01:33:11,305 --> 01:33:17,490
