{1243}{1284}You got him! You got him!
{1623}{1700}Only ever met one man I wouldn't want to fight.
{1702}{1736}I can't stop that.
{1738}{1784}Here. Get out of here, you useless tit.
{1786}{1864}When I met him, he was already|the best cut man in the business.
{1866}{1896}Can you stop it?
{1898}{1985}Started training and managing in the '60s,|but he never lost his gift.
{1987}{2012}No.
{2189}{2256}Let me have a look at him.
{2260}{2302}He's fine. He's fine.
{2304}{2359}Well, he ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.
{2361}{2398}I'll give you one more round.
{2424}{2463}Seconds out. Let's go.
{2465}{2520}What do we do? Tell me what to do.
{2522}{2573}You let him hit you.
{2634}{2705}Sometimes, there's just nothing you can do.
{2724}{2784}Cut's too wide, too close to the bone...
{2817}{2857}Maybe you got a severed vein...
{2859}{2938}...or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.
{2985}{3063}There are all kinds|of combinations you come up against...
{3066}{3126}...down in the different layers of meat...
{3128}{3176}...and Frankie knew how to work every one.
{3797}{3869}People love violence.
{3883}{3948}They slow down at a car wreck|to check for bodies.
{3949}{4006}Same people claim to love boxing.
{4008}{4075}They got no idea what it is.
{4077}{4131}Boxing is about respect...
{4133}{4179}...getting it for yourself...
{4181}{4246}...and taking it away from the other guy.
{4349}{4391}I'll warm up the car.
{4393}{4430}Mr Dunn?
{4432}{4483}I owe you money?
{4485}{4515}No, sir.
{4517}{4550}I know your mama?
{4553}{4601}Don't rightly know, sir.
{4603}{4639}Then what is it you want?
{4641}{4707}I was on the undercard. I won my fight, too.
{4709}{4743}Maggie Fitzgerald.
{4745}{4807}Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?
{4809}{4846}Did you happen to see it?
{4848}{4906}Nope.|I did pretty good.
{4908}{4966}Thought you might|be interested in training me.
{4969}{5012}I don't train girls.
{5014}{5107}Maybe you should.|People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.
{5109}{5178}Girlie, tough ain't enough.
{5511}{5555}It's a mistake.
{5681}{5736}Car should be able to back up, Frankie.
{5738}{5798}Just push, will you?
{5800}{5851}What did Hogan want?
{5853}{5891}Offered us a title shot.
{5893}{5970}'Bout time.|I turned him down flat.
{5972}{6067}Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.
{6168}{6255}Been two or three more fights|for a long time now, Frankie.
{6257}{6318}Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title.
{6320}{6370}You lose it, it may not come around again.
{6372}{6472}Now, two or three more fights,|and we'll be ready.
{6474}{6523}Whatever you say, Frankie.
{6556}{6653}Frankie liked to say|that boxing is an unnatural act...
{6655}{6724}...that everything in boxing is backwards.
{6777}{6826}Sometimes...
{6828}{6884}...best way to deliver a punch is step back.
{7105}{7235}Well, do your best, Lord, to... protect Katy.
{7237}{7281}Annie, too.
{7309}{7386}Other than that... you know what I want.
{7388}{7455}There's no use me repeating myself.
{7457}{7572}But step back too far, you ain't fightin'at all.
{7912}{7961}Thank you for your prayers.
{7963}{8012}Bye.|Goodbye.
{8014}{8073}Hey, Father, that was a great sermon.
{8076}{8111}Made me weep.
{8113}{8155}What's confusing you this week?
{8157}{8218}Oh, it's the same old one God, three God thing.
{8220}{8299}Frankie, most people figure out|by kindergarten it's about faith.
{8301}{8410}Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop|all rolled up in one big box?
{8412}{8516}You're standing outside my church|comparing God to Rice Krispies?
{8518}{8610}You only come to Mass every day to wind me|up. It's not going to happen this morning.
{8613}{8640}Well, I'm confused.
{8642}{8676}No, you aren't.|Yes, I am.
{8678}{8750}Then here's your answer: There's one God.
{8752}{8796}Anything else? Cos I'm busy.
{8798}{8863}What about the Holy Ghost?|An expression of God's love.
{8865}{8924}And Jesus?|Son of God. Don't play stupid.
{8926}{8995}Well, what is he, then?|Does that make him a demigod?
{8997}{9057}There are no demigods, you fuckin' pagan!
{9181}{9227}Did you write to your daughter?
{9229}{9255}Absolutely.
{9257}{9335}Now you're lying to a priest.|You know what? Take a day off.
{9337}{9386}Don't come to Mass tomorrow.
{9605}{9718}Some people'd say the most|important thing a fighter can have is heart.
{9745}{9826}Frankie'd say,|"Show me a fighter with nothing but a heart...
{9828}{9899}...and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating."
{10093}{10182}Think I only ever met one fighter|who was all heart.
{10209}{10259}My name's Dangerous Dillard.
{10261}{10364}Fightin' Flippo Bam-Bam Barch|out of Broward County, Texas!
{10405}{10485}Danger showed up a couple of years back.
{10512}{10634}He'd come visiting L.A. with Ervel,|his mama's new boyfriend.
{10636}{10762}Apparently, Ervel got lost|and ended up backin Texas.
{10765}{10892}Danger looked for him for about a week|before he introduced himself.
{10921}{11044}Hey. You know, I gots nothin' against niggers...
{11080}{11123}Well, that's nice to hear.
{11162}{11240}Lots of people where I comes from does...
{11243}{11366}...but my mama taught me not to cause hurt|to no man, niggers or not.
{11368}{11442}You got a nice mama.|Anything else I can do for you?
{11444}{11546}Just one of those questions,|but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.
{11548}{11657}Well, sir, I'd likes to become|the Welterweight Champion of the world.
{11696}{11826}And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,|Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...
{11829}{11929}...to fight me for the Welterweight|Championship of the whole world!
{11931}{11997}Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.
{11998}{12069}You got to have at least one fight to be ranked.
{12071}{12118}Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!
{12121}{12163}Hey, you a bad man?
{12165}{12231}Hey, come on, get in the ring.|Go a round with me.
{12233}{12266}Shawrelle...
{12269}{12302}I will.
{12305}{12337}Leave him alone.
{12377}{12442}Danger, you go on back to training.
{12444}{12499}Will do, Mr Scrap.
{12592}{12636}Them some nice tights, Danger.
{12663}{12723}I'll give you that ass-whoopin' later, Olive Oyl.
{12725}{12778}Those pants lookreal pretty on you, bro.
{12781}{12830}Give his mama back her tights.
{12832}{12926}Shawrelle Berry|had a left hook that would move a tank...
{12928}{13004}...but he had a heart the size of a split pea.
{13006}{13106}Frankie bought the Hit Pit|from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.
{13108}{13189}Bobby wanted to move to Florida,|and Frankie wanted some security.
{13191}{13259}Bobby died while he was packing.
{13261}{13355}Frankie found out... most gyms lose money.
{13357}{13434}I thought I told you I didn't want Danger|working out here anymore.
{13436}{13484}He ain't hurtin' nothin', Frankie.
{13486}{13527}Well, he's hurtin' me.
{13529}{13642}Breakin' my heart watchin' him|punch the air like it's going to punch back.
{13644}{13713}And how many times have I got to|tell you that bleach is bleach?
{13715}{13758}Why can't you just buy the cheap stuff?
{13760}{13814}You don't always have to buy expensive stuff.
{13816}{13863}It smells better, Frankie.
{13865}{13942}Bleach smells like bleach.
{14140}{14167}Hey, Scrap.
{14169}{14212}Hey, Mr Willie.
{14272}{14321}Hey, nice fight last night.
{14528}{14560}Big Willie.
{14562}{14589}Hey, Sally.
{14672}{14708}Nice fight.|Thanks, man.
{14710}{14752}People are talkin'.
{15103}{15169}What the hell kind of language is that?
{15192}{15231}What do you want?
{15233}{15294}I just thought you might like to know...
{15296}{15370}...you got a fighter out there|not talking to another manager.
{15372}{15466}Not talking to another manager?
{15468}{15500}Not just any manager.
{15536}{15565}Mickey Mack.
{15591}{15713}You came in here to tell me|that Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.
{15715}{15777}Not a word. Neither one of 'em.
{15805}{15854}I'm trying to read here.
{15856}{15912}Well, if you think that's more important...
{15947}{16003}Who's your new girl?
{16029}{16083}What?
{16328}{16370}Jesus Christ.
{16372}{16406}Better hurry up.
{16408}{16484}If she keeps hitting it like that,|she gonna break her wrists.
{16672}{16714}You're wasting your time.
{16716}{16794}I told you I don't train girls.|Thought you might change your mind.
{16796}{16854}There's dozens of trainers who train girls.
{16857}{16903}You won't have any trouble finding one.
{16905}{16959}Don't hardly need a dozen, boss.|You'll do fine.
{16961}{17056}Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss,|and don't you be calling me that.
{17058}{17127}Willie, you ready to work?|Anytime.
{17128}{17194}If I stop calling you boss, will you train me?
{17195}{17224}No.
{17252}{17298}I might as well just keep calling you it.
{17324}{17398}She came from|southwestern Missouri...
{17400}{17504}...the hills outside|the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia...
{17506}{17626}...set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere|between nowhere and good-bye.
{17628}{17691}She grew up knowing one thing:
{17693}{17737}She was trash.
{18067}{18098}It's for my dog.
{18101}{18235}She'd come 1,800 miles,|but Theodosia was still just over the hill.
{18668}{18710}Workin' the bag, boss.
{18713}{18778}Not your boss... and that bag's working you.
{19130}{19177}Give her her money back.
{19204}{19258}You sure?
{19260}{19306}How much did she pay?
{19308}{19338}Six months.
{19340}{19380}Oh, Jesus Christ.
{19382}{19420}No, I'll just give it back.
{19422}{19482}No. Don't be a smart-ass now, will you?
{19484}{19590}Woman thinks I'd throw away six months' dues|just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.
{19593}{19674}But just don't encourage her, understand?|Ok.
{19676}{19727}And what's Danger doing out there?
{19729}{19782}What's he lookin'at?
{19896}{19931}Looks like a bottle of water.
{19933}{19991}He paid his dues?
{19993}{20038}Dues?
{20040}{20103}Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?
{20106}{20158}Get out of my office.
{20403}{20440}Fuck me.
{21540}{21583}Can't think of it as a bag.
{21671}{21718}I'm not a trainer...
{21720}{21766}...but I can show you this, if you'd like.
{21768}{21806}Appreciate any help I can get.
{21808}{21870}Ok. Let's see.
{21872}{21946}What you want to do is|you want to think of it as a man, see?
{21948}{21982}And he's constantly moving.
{21985}{22098}He's moving towards you. He's moving around|you. He's moving away from you, all right?
{22100}{22160}You don't want to hit him|when he's coming towards you...
{22162}{22210}...cos what he's going to do is push you back.
{22212}{22310}He's going to smother your punches,|take your balance, right?
{22312}{22391}So watch him carefully.|Keep rotating, that keeps your head moving...
{22393}{22486}...and keep one shoulder back|so you're always ready to fire a power shot.
{22488}{22522}Right? Go ahead, now.
{22524}{22566}Good, good. Keep rotating.
{22569}{22618}Keep moving. That's it.
{22621}{22694}Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.
{22696}{22737}Come on around.
{22741}{22782}Keep moving, keep moving.
{22784}{22814}Good.
{22816}{22895}Like that?|Yeah. Keep on moving, give it a few shots.
{22924}{22981}Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.
{23019}{23074}That's good.
{23076}{23169}Now, you get this down,|we'll put you on the speed bag.
{23243}{23289}You do have a speed bag?
{23540}{23606}I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.
{23608}{23654}All right, you go on home now.
{23656}{23690}I'll walk out with you?
{23693}{23754}No, I am home. Want to see?
{23990}{24033}It's nice.
{24095}{24154}Would it bother you much|if I worked a little longer?
{24157}{24205}No, just...
{24208}{24264}...pull the door closed when you leave.
{24319}{24368}Thank you.
{24728}{24789}If there's magic in boxing...
{24791}{24885}...it's the magic of fighting battles|beyond endurance...
{24888}{25010}...beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys|and detached retinas.
{25251}{25367}It's the magic of risking everything|for a dream that nobody sees but you.
{25609}{25666}Ok, come on. Watch the footwork.
{26175}{26216}Hey, Flip.
{26218}{26264}Hey, Flippy, come here, man.
{26266}{26323}I think I found somebody you can beat.
{26400}{26444}I don't fights women.
{26465}{26561}Why not, bro?|It's perfect, bro, cos you know why?
{26563}{26614}Cos she -you could fight to him...
{26616}{26702}...and then you could kiss to him, and then|you could fight to him one more time.
{26704}{26764}That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.
{26766}{26839}It's like poetry.|You been reading and shit.
{26841}{26876}Thanks, bro. That's a girl, man?
{26878}{26937}I'll be damn, Flip. I think you right.
{26939}{27010}Look at her little bitty titties.|They're like mosquito bites.
{27012}{27061}Geez, man, there's barely even a mouthful.
{27063}{27114}Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.
{27116}{27195}Spent so much time face down,|I thought the canvas had titties.
{27294}{27348}Canvas has titties.
{27350}{27428}Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.
{27620}{27693}Just humping the canvas.|Humping the floor.
{27723}{27810}Come on, bro, the floor is having titties?|That's funny, bro.
{27812}{27850}Shut up, man.
{27852}{27893}What you laughing at?
{27896}{27961}Man, hold the bag, stupid.
{28052}{28142}Yo, when they start making those tights for men,|Flippy?
{28144}{28187}Punk.
{28213}{28299}All right, that's enough.|That's enough for the day.
{28348}{28406}I'll give you a rubdown.|Oh, I can't, Frankie.
{28409}{28494}My middle one's got a piano lesson.|I told Gracie I'd drive her.
{28496}{28542}Oh. Something wrong with Gracie's car?
{28544}{28633}She hates that car. Wants the old one back,|but the dealer won't do it.
{28635}{28708}Said he's already got a buyer.|Maybe I should talk to the dealer.
{28710}{28762}I'd appreciate that.
{28764}{28797}Ok.
{28799}{28826}Thanks.
{28828}{28866}See you later.
{29060}{29106}The man's a rubdown whore.
{29108}{29151}Today he doesn't want one?
{29178}{29222}You ever do any work around here?
{29224}{29304}Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.
{29381}{29433}Little girl seems to be coming along.
{29492}{29559}It's almost like someone's been helping her.
{29561}{29618}She might just be a natural.
{29620}{29675}Looks like she's got something.
{29725}{29791}She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.
{29815}{29862}I wonder how the hell she got that.
{29864}{29911}I wonder.
{30133}{30186}I'm going to need that speed bag back.
{30188}{30232}This bag?|Yes, that bag.
{30234}{30325}That's my bag, and if you're hitting it,|people will think I'm training you.
{30327}{30378}Is that such a bad thing, boss?
{30380}{30415}Yes, yes, it is.
{30417}{30483}Every time you touch it,|you're losing me business out here.
{30485}{30577}I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.
{30579}{30686}Yeah. Well,|I can't just lend it to anybody, you know.
{30688}{30721}I understand.
{30749}{30794}Yeah.
{30827}{30893}Look, you seem like a nice girl.
{30894}{30966}Can I give you some advice?|I'd appreciate that.
{30969}{31042}You're going to find a trainer,|either in this gym or somewhere else...
{31044}{31086}...that's going to want to train a girl.
{31088}{31153}It's the latest freak show out there.
{31154}{31244}But the trouble is, they're going to be wasting|your time because you're too old.
{31271}{31321}I don't feel that old.
{31323}{31410}Well, neither do I, but you don't see me|fighting 21-year-olds, do you?
{31412}{31501}Takes about four years to train a fighter.
{31503}{31552}How old are you?
{31555}{31649}31... until my next birthday.|Oh, well, there you go.
{31651}{31684}31.
{31686}{31769}You wouldn't start training|to be a ballerina at 31, now, would you?
{31771}{31833}Already been working it for three years.
{31835}{31877}And you can't hit a speed bag?
{31880}{31925}What kind of training is that?
{31927}{31975}I've never had any, boss.
{31977}{32052}Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.
{32054}{32111}Somebody's gotta be honest with you.
{32113}{32187}I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.
{32241}{32316}Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr Dunn.
{32389}{32438}You're not going to cry now, are you?
{32440}{32485}No, sir.
{32552}{32593}Here.
{32620}{32664}Keep the goddamn thing.
{32666}{32757}No, you need it.|No, take the bag.
{32760}{32809}I haven't seen it in 20 years, anyway.
{32811}{32862}I've had three since then.
{32864}{32928}Just enjoy it, will you?
{32931}{32976}I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.
{33005}{33046}Just don't lose it.
{33247}{33293}Yeah, I know, Hogan.
{33295}{33369}Your guy's the champ, so we don't split fifties.
{33372}{33409}But if I don't see 40%...
{33468}{33562}Look, you call me back when it's 60-40,|or don't call me back at all.
{33772}{33808}Hey, Willie.
{33810}{33872}Hey, Frankie.|Is something wrong?
{33875}{33925}I'm sorry to come by your house like this.
{33927}{33983}I know you don't like people dropping in.
{33985}{34082}You're not people, Willie.|You're welcome anytime. Come on in.
{34084}{34137}I want to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.
{34140}{34187}Well, you don't have to thank me.
{34189}{34286}Paying an extra thousand dollars|for your own car ain't exactly a favour.
{34288}{34341}Gracie broke out and cried|when she saw it.
{34343}{34392}Really?
{34394}{34460}I also needed to talk with you about business.
{34462}{34561}Well, I just got off the phone with Hogan.|We're all set for September.
{34563}{34609}Everything but the split.
{34611}{34658}I gotta leave you, Frankie.
{34708}{34743}What?
{34821}{34903}Willie, the title is just two fights away.
{34905}{34939}It ain't that. It's...
{34941}{35009}It's like you said, I got one shot.
{35011}{35084}If I win, I gotta make|as much as I can while I can.
{35086}{35182}I need somebody in the action,|who can make things happen.
{35205}{35262}And I gotta make the change before the fight.
{35264}{35333}Only way this guy say he'd take me|is if he took me to the title.
{35335}{35445}So, I get you to the title fight,|and this guy takes you there?
{35448}{35485}Only way he'd do it.
{35487}{35533}I'm sorry, Frankie.
{35535}{35597}I know how long|you've been waiting on a title.
{35599}{35639}I wish it could've been with me.
{35665}{35722}Mickey Mack's a businessman.
{35724}{35780}He can't teach you nothing.
{35782}{35851}You already taught me|everything I need to know.
{36047}{36136}There's some things|people just don't want to hear.
{36389}{36484}And I challenge the Motor City Cobra,|Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns...
{36487}{36608}...to fight me for the|Welterweight Championship of the whole world.
{36610}{36678}Danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.
{36680}{36754}Just working on my footwork, Mr Scrap.
{36783}{36867}Danger, you throw a punch|or get the hell out of this gym.
{36979}{37078}Danger, while you thinking about that punch,|I'll be right back.
{37104}{37209}I'm thinking how|I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr Scrap.
{37317}{37442}No one had the heart|to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.
{37635}{37702}I heard about Willie.
{37704}{37761}That's cold. That's dead cold.
{37763}{37861}Course, it wouldn't be so bad|if you weren't so damn old.
{37863}{37932}At least I can see through both eyes.
{37934}{37996}Didn't do you a lot of good though, did it?
{37999}{38070}Well, I've got the gym.
{38072}{38141}Don't need to be training fighters at my age.
{38168}{38221}Willie tell you why?
{38223}{38257}It was Mickey.
{38260}{38297}Mickey's got the connections.
{38299}{38382}It ain't about connections, Frank.|It's about you not believing in him.
{38384}{38449}Well, I found him.|I stuck with him for eight years.
{38451}{38501}How's that for not believing in him?
{38504}{38587}You could've got him a title fight two years ago.|Hell, he knew that.
{38589}{38628}I'm amazed he stayed this long.
{38630}{38717}Well, getting there and taking home|the belt are two different things.
{38719}{38833}What was I supposed to do,|just put him in over his head, not protect him?
{38835}{38883}You were protecting him|from the championship?
{38884}{38902}Yea.
{38918}{38983}Oh, well, now it makes sense.
{38985}{39056}Well, what about you, Scrap?|What did your manager do?
{39058}{39130}You were a hell of a fighter,|a lot better than Willie.
{39132}{39201}He get you a title fight|or did he just bust you out...
{39203}{39300}...banging your head against other people's fists|until you lost your eye?
{39302}{39353}I had my shot.
{39355}{39422}I went out swinging and no man can say I didn't.
{39424}{39507}Well, I remember.|And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter...
{39509}{39597}...spending the second half of his life|cleaning up other people's spit.
{39599}{39632}Yeah, right.
{39634}{39678}Right. You're the smart one.
{39680}{39733}You're the one learning Greek.
{39756}{39787}It's Gaelic.
{39789}{39867}Well, you just protected yourself|out of a championship fight.
{39869}{39912}How do you say that in Gaelic?
{41556}{41603}Sorry.
{41767}{41811}Thanks.
{42038}{42124}Boxing is an unnatural act...
{42127}{42205}...cos everythingin it is backwards.
{42255}{42289}You want to move to the left...
{42292}{42387}...you don't step left, you push on the right toe.
{42411}{42499}To move right, you use your left toe.
{42501}{42588}Instead of running from the pain,|like a sane person would do...
{42590}{42637}...you step into it.
{42666}{42786}Oh, my God! He hits the|champ with a right hand and the champ's down!
{42835}{42901}Ladies and gentlemen,|the ref has ended the count.
{42904}{42976}And Big Willie Jones|is the new champion of the world!
{42978}{43052}It's unbelievable how this|has taken place tonight.
{43054}{43119}But there you have it, folks, a new champion.
{43173}{43243}Everything in boxing is backwards.
{43611}{43651}Want a cheeseburger?
{43653}{43703}You bought me a cheeseburger.
{43705}{43760}I never seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger.
{43762}{43837}Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it.|You want it?
{43839}{43906}Well, I guess the planet can go back to spinning.
{43943}{43985}You watch the fight?
{43987}{44041}Yeah, I watched it.
{44043}{44109}Willie did good.
{44111}{44161}That's what you've got to say?
{44163}{44226}Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.
{44243}{44320}I see you been working on yourself,|learning to open up.
{44322}{44357}That's good work.
{44359}{44397}You watch it?
{44399}{44445}Yeah, I got HBO.
{44477}{44548}How can you afford HBO?
{44550}{44633}How long have I been telling you|to save your money?
{44635}{44693}Ever since I fought|Louis "Typhoon" Johnson...
{44695}{44765}...at the Stadium Club in Tupelo, Mississippi.
{44767}{44813}That true?
{44815}{44917}Manager ran off|and left you and me to hitch home.
{44919}{44957}Don't you remember nothing?
{44959}{45005}Well, I remember walking halfway...
{45007}{45049}...and thinking I was going to be lynched.
{45051}{45149}I remember you leaving me with my dick|in my hand behind that gas station.
{45152}{45195}Well, I got a ride.
{45197}{45289}The guy took off before I hardly closed the door.|I had to walk back two miles.
{45291}{45360}Your conscience got the better of you,|that's what.
{45463}{45502}What the hell's that?
{45527}{45598}It's her birthday.
{46109}{46203}You're not breathing right.|That's why you're panting.
{46205}{46271}So, it's your birthday?
{46273}{46319}How old does that make you?
{46321}{46434}I'm 32, Mr Dunn...|and I'm here celebrating the fact...
{46436}{46543}...that I spent another year scraping dishes|and waitressing, what I've been doing since 13.
{46545}{46649}And according to you, I'll be 37|before I can even throw a decent punch...
{46651}{46727}...which after working this speed bag for a month|and getting nowhere...
{46729}{46780}I now realise may be God's simple truth.
{46782}{46847}Other truth is, my brother's in prison...
{46849}{46935}...my sister cheats on welfare by pretending|one of her babies is still alive...
{46937}{47005}...my daddy's dead,|and my mama weighs 312 pounds.
{47008}{47088}If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home...
{47090}{47169}...find a used trailer,|buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.
{47201}{47291}The problem is, this is the only thing|I ever felt good doing.
{47293}{47344}If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.
{47381}{47433}That enough truth to suit you?
{47472}{47510}This your speed bag?
{47512}{47589}Put yours behind the counter.|Wish I could say I wore it out.
{47676}{47722}Just hold it, hold it.
{47724}{47810}I'll show you a few things,|and then we'll get you a trainer.
{47813}{47847}No. Sorry.
{47849}{47909}You're in a position to negotiate?|Yes, sir...
{47913}{48011}...because I know if you train me right,|I'm going to be a champ.
{48045}{48088}I seen you looking at me.
{48090}{48127}Yeah, out of pity.
{48130}{48167}Don't you say that!
{48169}{48235}Don't you say that if it ain't true!
{48237}{48280}I want a trainer.
{48282}{48333}I don't want charity...
{48335}{48379}...and I don't want favours.
{48473}{48558}If you're not interested,|then I got more celebrating to do.
{48659}{48703}Goddamn it, stop.
{48727}{48764}What the hell are you doing?
{48892}{48950}If I'm going to take you on...
{48952}{48990}You won't never regret it.
{48992}{49023}Look, just listen to me.
{49025}{49095}If I take you on...|I promise I'll work so hard.
{49097}{49156}God, this is a mistake already.
{49158}{49243}I'm listening, boss.
{49245}{49326}If I take you on, you don't say anything.
{49328}{49372}You don't question me.
{49375}{49474}You don't ask why, you don't say anything|except maybe, "Yes, Frankie."
{49477}{49554}And I'm going to try to forget|the fact that you're a girl.
{49556}{49587}It's all I ask.
{49589}{49651}And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.
{49653}{49717}All righty.|We got a deal.
{49718}{49768}No, not quite.
{49771}{49825}I'm going to teach you how to fight.
{49827}{49893}Then, we'll get you a manager,|and I'm off down the road.
{49895}{49934}I hate to argue with you, but...
{49937}{49988}Don't argue, it's the only way we're doing it.
{49991}{50078}I teach you all you need to know, and then|you go off and make a million dollars.
{50080}{50166}I don't care. You get your teeth|knocked out, I don't care.
{50168}{50275}I don't want to hear about it either way,|that's how it is. It's the only way I'll do it.
{50470}{50499}All right.
{50501}{50631}Now, one of the things I've noticed around|the gym is, you never move your feet.
{50632}{50711}You stand there just flatfooted.|You've got to move your feet.
{50713}{50785}That's one of the best things|I'm going to be able to teach you.
{50787}{50875}So, here's what you do. You get yourself...
{50877}{50921}Bend your knees a little bit.
{50923}{50962}Get in an athletic position.
{50964}{51019}Look like you're going to hit something.
{51073}{51144}Move 'em how, boss?|Just, you go hit the bag.
{51187}{51230}Stop.|What'd I do wrong?
{51232}{51281}Ok, you did two things wrong.
{51283}{51372}One is you asked a question,|and two is you asked another question.
{51374}{51429}Now, what I want you to do...
{51431}{51475}It's not about hitting it hard.
{51477}{51517}It's how good you hit it.
{51519}{51565}So, watch me.
{51567}{51632}And you can count with me if you want,|just count;
{51633}{51685}...on a one count, I hit right through the bag.
{51687}{51739}Can you show me that again?|You just...
{51741}{51792}Just say "one," please.
{51794}{51835}One.|Ok, one.
{51879}{51957}Yeah, just say one.|That's good. That's good.
{51959}{52008}Then I move over to my right foot.
{52010}{52078}You'll see my weight is|shifting to my right foot.
{52080}{52195}Then I hit it with the back of my hand,|sort of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.
{52197}{52232}Then I come over...
{52233}{52318}...and I shift to my left foot,|and I hit it with my right hand.
{52366}{52483}And ice pick manoeuvre again, and I come|over on my right foot and hit it right, left.
{52508}{52568}Don't watch anything but my feet.
{52595}{52634}One, two, three...
{52847}{52914}Just do it like that. Just keep practising.
{53660}{53774}Need to show 'em how to|stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.
{53947}{54038}To make a fighter,|you got to strip 'em down to bare wood.
{54040}{54077}Rest when you're dead.
{54079}{54122}Come here.
{54202}{54297}You can't just tell 'em|to "forget everything you know".
{54299}{54357}You got to make 'em forget it in their bones.
{54359}{54423}Left uppercut, left, left.
{54543}{54637}...only hear your voice,|only do what you say and nothing else.
{54640}{54668}Move your feet.
{54670}{54725}Move your feet around. Let's see you go.
{55118}{55160}...and take it away from the other guy.
{55163}{55201}Not so low. Look at me.
{55203}{55250}Right hook and just turn right over...
{55347}{55429}How to generate|momentum off your right toe...
{55459}{55538}...and how to flex your knees|when you fire a jab.
{55672}{55708}How to fight backing up...
{55711}{55780}...so that the other guy|doesn't want to come after you.
{55783}{55842}Then you got to show 'em all over again...
{55844}{55962}...over and over and over till they think|they were born that way.
{56018}{56089}Shift. Shift away. Shift away.
{56115}{56192}Ok, that's enough for today.
{56194}{56266}Good work. Good girl.
{56320}{56384}Think I'm ready for a fight, boss?
{56949}{56997}Hey, come here.
{57064}{57106}You're not breathing.
{57146}{57186}Hate to disagree with you.
{57189}{57265}Every time you get under pressure,|you're holding your breath.
{57267}{57302}Now, stop doing that.
{57350}{57414}But other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?
{57416}{57471}I mean, for a girl.
{57473}{57511}I don't train girls.
{57569}{57623}Think I might be ready for a fight, boss?
{57625}{57707}Well, we'll get a manager,|and we'll find out, won't we?
{57709}{57796}I'd like to, but you've|been keeping me too busy.
{57950}{57997}Got any family, boss?
{57999}{58027}What?
{58089}{58163}You been spending all this time with me.|I didn't know if you had any.
{58188}{58223}No.
{58248}{58322}Well, I've got a daughter|Katy.
{58325}{58368}That's family.
{58370}{58438}We're not exactly close.
{58440}{58483}How much she weigh?
{58508}{58546}What?
{58548}{58606}Trouble in my family comes by the pound.
{58677}{58713}Yeah.
{58716}{58774}Not very big.
{58776}{58826}Used to be real athletic.
{58828}{58880}Don't know if she kept it up.
{59017}{59086}So... what do you think?
{59113}{59160}Am I ready for a fight?
{59282}{59315}Hey, Sally.
{59375}{59416}Come here for a minute, will you?
{59460}{59529}Frankie, I need to see you|in the back for a minute, Ok?
{59532}{59565}Can I see you a minute?
{59567}{59652}Sally here is a real good manager.|Has a couple Golden Glove boys.
{59654}{59701}Looking for a girl, Sally?
{59704}{59754}I'm looking for a good one.
{59777}{59825}Well, see, there you go.
{59905}{59965}Nice working with you, girlie.
{60043}{60098}What'd you want?|Nothing. It's nothing.
{60100}{60214}I ain't lying. I been watching you work.|You've got a hell of a left.
{60216}{60260}Thank you.
{60318}{60374}So, you want to give this a try, see if it's a fit?
{60439}{60481}Yeah, sure.
