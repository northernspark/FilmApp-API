The only way we can compete
with the Eastern Bloc teams

What kind of scheduling changes
are we talking about?

make it longer.

You gonna pay for that?

We also need to change the way

My plan is to adopt a new style.

A hybrid of the Soviet school
and the canadian school.

104
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,621
A combination that requires the
highest level of conditioning,

105
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,965
speed, creativity,
and most of all, team chemistry.

Is this what you've been using

Walter, we don't have years.
We have months.

110
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,208
You think you can take kids
who've never played together

111
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,718
and teach them a new style
of play in the time we have?

112
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,276
Here's the North American style.

113
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,686
What if these kids can't
pick it up fast enough?

114
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,453
We all know we're
a long shot for a medal,

115
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,187
but we don't want to
get embarrassed.

116

-That's right.
-That's right.

I think it was 15-1.

120
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,868
In all due respect, I don't
think we can embarrass ourselves

121
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,599
any more than that.

122
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,107
That's assuming
they don't go pro.

123
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,372
I don't know about you, but l'd
have a hard time giving up money

00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,743
to finish sixth at Lake Placid.

125
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,442
It's a tough draw, Herb.
Tough draw.

126
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,610
It's a tough draw even if
we don't play the Soviets.

127
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,313
What the hell happens if we do?

128
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,753
We put our best on the ice
with them last year.

129
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,314
Professional all-stars.
They still beat us.

130
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,225
It wasn't because
you weren't good enough.

131
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,431
All-star teams fail

132
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,596
because they rely solely
on the individual's talent.

133
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,573
The Soviets win because
they take that talent

134
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,802
and use it inside a system

135
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,344
that's designed for
the betterment of the team.

136
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,371
My goal is to beat them
at their own game.

137
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,315
Beat the best team in the world?

138

Gold medalists in
'64, '68, '72, '76?

139
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,489
That's a pretty lofty goal,
Herb.

140
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,789
Lou, that's why I want to
pursue it.

141
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,061
Well, fellas,
any more questions?

142
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,999
-I'm good.
-No?

143

Ah, I'm not their guy.

153
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,971
The only reason
they had me come out there

154
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,939
was because two other coaches
already said no.

You've got a little homework
to do before you celebrate.

322
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,294
Thank you.

323
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,496
Whoo!

324
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,395
Herb!

325
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,168
Herb.

326
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,936
Hold on a minute.

327
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,937
Hey, Walter.
How we doing?

328
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,709
I think we got
a problem here, Herb.

329
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,771
What's that?

330
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,647
I got a roomful
of people up there

331
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,619
who want to have a say
in this process,

332
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,450
and you've already
picked the team.

333
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,012
-Look, Walter.
-No, no.

334
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,389
There's a right way to do
this kind of thing,

335
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,087
and this is not it.

336
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,526
I know you got a job to do.

337
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,292
If I was in your shoes,
I'd be saying the same thing.

338
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,833
All right, then.

339
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,595
Let's go upstairs.

340
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,637
We'll help piece together
a hockey team.

341
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,262
All of us.
Together.

342
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,206
Walter, that's just
not gonna happen.

343
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,869
Do you realize
what the A.H.A. went through

344
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,572
to put this thing together?

345
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,740
The best amateur players in the
country on the ice for a week?

346
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,113
-Yeah.
-Not just a day.

347
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,914
I didn't ask for that,
because I already know my team.

348
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,477
How do you know your team?

349
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,524
Those kids haven't been on the
ice for maybe a couple of hours.

350
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,686
Every one of those boys was
chosen for a specific reason.

351
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,094
I've studied film
on each one of those boys.

352
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,724
I've watched them,
and I've coached a lot of them.

353
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,030
The ones I haven't,
I've spoken with their coaches

354
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,228
and scouts in the area.

355
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,464
Now, I know best
what I need to compete.

356
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,406
And the team I've chosen is it.

357
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,103
What am I supposed to say
to the advisory board?

358
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,270
Tell them the truth.

359
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,110
This puts me
in a hell of a spot, Herb.

360
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,240
A hell of a spot!

361
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,080
Well, they hired me to do a job.
I'm trying to do it.

362
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,290
All right.

363
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,596
I'm gonna back you on this.

364
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,994
But I sure as hell hope
you know what you're doing.

365
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,168
Hey, Phillie, what are you on?

366
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,768
My test is done.

367
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,938
Jesus!

368
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,174
Me and Jannie are done.

369
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,376
Verchota, you're done?
I'm on page four.

370
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,680
"71.

371
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,654
You get stopped by a policeman,
but you're not at fault.

372
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,384
Do you state
your disagreement right away?"

373
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,224
He's got 300 of these things.

374
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,729
It's just a test, Silky.

375
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,458
You've taken one or two before.

376
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,193
Not to play hockey, I haven't.

377
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,461
can you even read, Silky?

378
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,298
I try.

379
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,196
Hey, Rizzo!

380
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,171
-What's going on?
-Mac.

381
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,281
Easy, big guy.

382
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,514
I don't know how you can sit in
the same room with that clown.

383
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,581
Let it go. It's over.
Let it go.

384
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,250
What's going on here?

385
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,558
O.c.'s got a little
unfinished business over there.

386
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,758
Not for long I don't.

387
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,027
What did I tell you, man?

388
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,093
Mcclanahan?

389
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,265
You're not still going on about
the '76 playoffs, are you?

390
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,742
come on, O.c., that was,
like, three years ago.

391
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,075
You know what, coxie,
let me ask you a question.

392
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,172
Why did you want to
play college hockey?

393
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,240
Isn't it obvious?
For the girls.

394
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,114
I'm serious, coxie.

395
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,450
Why did you want to
play college hockey?

396
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,281
'cause I love to play hockey.

397
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,883
I want to go to the NHL
just like everybody does.

398
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,087
I wanted to win
a National championship.

399
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,927
That pansy over there
cheap-shots me.

400
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,933
I get tossed out of the game.

401
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,299
He steals the ring
right off my finger?

402
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,804
How would you feel?

403
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,136
Everyone was throwing
cheap shots that night.

404
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,335
Rizzo, it's funny you say that.

405
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,378
I was just wondering
what side you're on.

406
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,742
I'm on your side.

407
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,838
You know,
it really seems that way.

408
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,384
All right, just relax, okay?
Jeez.

409
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,316
I'm not doing this right now.

410
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,945
I'm outta here.

411
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,251
Where you going?

412
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,252
To my room. Is that
all right with you, Mother?

413
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,862
cOX:
Just let him go.

414
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,460
Well, no wonder the guy
gets so many penalty minutes.

415
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,130
SlLK: He gets a little
carried away sometimes.

416
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,374
HERB: That's it.
Pick it up.

417
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,412
-That's it.
-Kick it out!

418
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,004
Look for the pass.
come on, hit him with a pass.

419
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,277
-Go, Johnson!
-Outside!

420
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,013
All right, Johnson,
hit him on the other side.

421
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,317
-Get them up!
-Look for him!

422
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,749
Move and hit him, Johnson.
He's open.

423
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,453
-center, center!
-come on, Johnson!

424
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,920
[ Whistle blows ]

425
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,090
Johnson!

426
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,159
That stuff may work here,

427
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,830
but it won't against
the teams we'll be playing.

428
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,033
Next line up.
Let's go. Let's run it again.

429
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,844
Morrow.

430
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,245
Let me take this one.

431
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,846
Don't worry about it.
Keep your head up.

432
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,082
HERB: This is
a breakout play, gentlemen.

433
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,716
So, please, let's get rid
of the puck early.

434
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,987
All right, let's go!

435
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,862
Hey, hey!

436
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,340
-Oh!
-Oh, my God.

437
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,569
-What's O.c. doing?
-That was cheap.

438
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,176
He didn't have the puck.

439
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,077
What are you hitting
like that for?

440
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,638
That's bush league, O.c.

441
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,206
Nice hit, O.c.

442
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,550
Tell your boy to keep his head
up, and he won't have to worry.

443
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,418
You all right, man?

444
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,718
Let's go!

445
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,124
craig, let them go.

446
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,630
You got him?

447
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,530
-Hey, stay on him!
-Stay out of it, Buzzy!

448
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,233
Get him.
come on, give it to him.

449
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,640
-What are you doing?
-Stay out of it, Baker!

450
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,405
come on, give it to him!

451
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,740
All right, Mac.

452
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,212
come on, Mac.
Take him down!

453
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,681
come on, O.c.!
Let him have it!

454
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,741
-Put him on the ice!
-come on, O.c.

455
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,844
There you go.
Beat him, O.c.

456
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:03,853
-Oh!
-Oh, man!

457
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,685
Whoa!

458
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,190
That's it.

459
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,292
HERB:
Well, how about it, boys?

460
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,353
Look like hockey to you?

461
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,192
Looks like a couple of monkeys
trying to hump a football to me.

462
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,031
What do you think, craig?

463
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,331
Yeah.

464
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,569
You want to settle old scores,
you're on the wrong team.

465
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,075
We move forward
starting right now.

466
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,583
We start becoming a team
right now!

467
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,750
Skating.

468
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,651
Passing.

469
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,058
Flow.

470
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,355
creativity.

471
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,192
That is what this team
is all about, gentlemen.

472
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,722
Not old rivalries.

473
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,097
Why don't we start
with some introductions?

474
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,606
You know, get to know
each other a little bit.

475
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,574
Where you're from, who you are.
Go ahead.

476
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,510
Rob Mcclanahan.

477
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,952
St. Paul, Minnesota.

478
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,114
Who you play for?

479
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,954
For you, here at the U.

480
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,124
Jack?

481
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,590
Jack O'callahan.

482
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,693
charlestown, Mass.

483
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,262
Boston University.

484
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,332
Over here.

485
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,736
I'm Ralph cox.

486
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,882
I'm from wherever's
not gonna get me hit.

487
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,212
Very good.

488
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,018
Everybody on the line.
Let's go.

489
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,297
& Must of got lost &

490
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,992
& Must of got lost &

491
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,533
-Hey, Jim.
-Hey, coach.

492
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,627
Been wondering why
you wouldn't take this test.

493
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,366
Yeah. Well...

494
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,707
It's nothing against you
or anything.

495
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,575
I just don't see what it has to
do with stopping a puck.

496
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,213
Well, that's all right.
You just took it anyway.

497
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,844
& Honey, I don't know &

498
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,554
Hey, coach.

499
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,566
So, if I took it...

500
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,123
You know, I meant to ask you.

501
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,033
How's your family doing?

502
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,829
Doing all right.

503
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,240
And you?

504
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,209
I'm okay.

505
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,713
You know, I got 26 guys
trying to make this team, Jim.

506
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,478
Only 20 are gonna go
to Lake Placid.

507
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,679
So I gotta know how committed
you are to being here.

508
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:54,157
Because if you're not,
you're just wasting our time.

509
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,921
Look, coach.

510
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,991
My dad's going through
a rough time right now.

511
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,403
He's got nothing.

512
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:10,874
He lost his job, and with
Atlanta trying to sign me...

513
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:18,644
Bottom line is,
my mom wanted this.

514
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,144
Me playing on this team.

515
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,954
Hard to say no to someone who
drove you to practice every day.

516
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,790
You didn't answer
my question, Jim.

517
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,930
I'm here, aren't l?

518
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,402
I'll see you in the morning.

519
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,139
Don't forget to bring your game.

520
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,089
MAN ON RADlO: The Soviets
performed a nuclear test,

521
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:03,526
setting off a 75-kiloton bomb
in eastern Kazakhstan.

522
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,894
So much hate and fear.

523
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,398
-What's that?
-The Soviets and the West.

524
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,593
They have nuclear weapons
pointed at each other.

525
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,466
It's bound to end in disaster.

526
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:15,062
Oh, come on. They'll figure
something out, Doc.

527
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,801
Don't got any other choice,
right?

528
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,899
Well, yeah, hope so.

529
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,742
But it seems to me there are
some people who never get along.

530
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,777
Yeah.

531
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,844
Like hockey players
from Boston and Minnesota.

532
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,184
Our own private cold War.

533
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:37,324
Hey, Doc, let me ask you
a question, all right?

534
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,488
You've worked with Herb
for a long time, right?

535
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,156
I've known Herb
for quite some time.

536
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,221
So tell me something.

537
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,531
Does he always treat
his players like this?

538
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,567
No. No, no.
This I have never seen.

539
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,109
But, craig, believe me.

540
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:55,908
Herb has a reason
for everything he does.

541
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,009
Well, he's ending up with
20 players who hate his guts.

542
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,381
Maybe if they hate him,

543
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,719
they won't have time
to hate each other.

544
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,590
& Out on Thunder Island &

545
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,288
& Doo doo doo &

546
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,990
& Doo doo doo doo-doo &

547
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,581
Hey, honey.

548
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,083
How much longer you gonna be?

549
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,016
I still got a few more.

550
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,557
Well, I'm going to bed, okay?

551
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,057
-Okay.
-Okay.

552
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,618
Oh, you know, Kelly has ballet
at 4:00 tomorrow

553
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,426
and Danny's done with hockey
camp at about the same time.

554
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,433
Which one do you want to get?

555
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,960
-Herb?
-Yeah.

556
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,766
can you pick up Danny at 4:00?

557
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,238
We got team meetings
after practice tomorrow.

558
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,070
I can't be in two places
at one time.

559
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,202
-What about Margie?
-They're on vacation.

560
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,247
Well, I don't know, honey.
You'll figure it out.

561
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,276
can you turn that off, please?

562
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,316
Please.

563
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,818
Herb, this is what happens
over the summer.

564
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,760
The kids are off
doing a zillion things,

565
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,128
and once in a while,
your meetings have to wait.

566
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,293
come on, Patti.
I'm coaching a hockey team here.

567
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,462
I mean, we already
talked about this.

568
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,596
Oh, really?

569
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,936
When exactly
did we have this talk?

570
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,171
Because I don't recall being
a part of the conversation.

571
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,768
What did I say?

572
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,780
Was it interesting?

573
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,907
We never had this talk.

574
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,348
Never.

575
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,678
Okay, what's on your mind?

576
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,814
Nothing.

577
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,916
No, you're obviously mad
about something.

578
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,120
First you're upset
because we didn't talk.

579
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,131
And then when I try to talk
about whatever it is,

580
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,257
you don't want to.

581
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,891
Patti,
if you're not willing to...

582
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,459
It's not because we didn't talk.

583
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,404
It's because
you never even asked.

584
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,542
I know what this is about.

585
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,375
I know it, and you know it.

586
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,880
What? Know what?

587
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,110
This.
What you're doing.

588
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,243
chasing after something
you didn't get,

589
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,413
that you may never get.

590
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,089
What if it doesn't
work out, Herb?

591
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,256
Are we gonna do this
every four years?

592
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,797
It's okay.

593
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,362
Go finish your work.
Go, go.

594
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,679
Hey.

595
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,085
Hey.

596
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,589
You know...

597
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:41,154
Ever since I stopped playing,
I wanted to coach this team.

598
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,726
And this is the only way
I know how to do it.

599
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,202
It's not the easiest way,
I know, for you.

600
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,072
Or the kids.
But...

601
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,278
Patti, I have to do this.

602
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,951
I know you do.

603
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,693
I'm sorry we didn't talk.

604
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,735
And I was wrong not to ask.

605
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:28,071
So I'm asking now if you
can be with me on this,

606
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:32,515
because it won't mean anything
if you're not.

607
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,536
Blue line, back.
Red line, back.

608
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:55,299
Far blue line, back.
Far red line, back.

609
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,001
And you have 45 seconds
to do it.

610
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:02,308
Get used to this drill.
We'll be doing it a lot.

611
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,211
Why?

612
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,579
Because the legs feed
the wolf, gentlemen.

613
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,453
I can't promise you
we'll be the best team

614
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,118
at Lake Placid next February.

615
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,423
But we will be
the best-conditioned.

616
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,194
That I can promise you.

617

[ Whistle blows ]

618
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,163
Be prepared to grow
through pain, gentlemen.

619
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,107
You're gonna skate harder
than you've skated in your lives

620
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,804
every minute of every day
you're on the ice with me.

621
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,244
Stretch things out
north and south,

622
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,611
you open things up
east and west.

623
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,013
center's gonna fill in here.

624
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,052
This far-side winger is gonna
come in, take the center spot.

625
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,587
-What's your name?
-Mark Johnson.

626
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,678
Where you from, Mark?

627
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,223
Madison, Wisconsin.

628
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,485
-Who you play for?
-University of Wisconsin.

come on, go, boys.
Go, boys!

631
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,868
The fastest way to make
this team is by being fast!

632
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,635
No, no!

633
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,940
Stop.
Look at you.

-There? Okay.

come on, Jimmy.

00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,652
challenge them!

640
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,449
You're getting beat
on the side here.

641
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,183
challenge them.

642
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,088
Yeah, I don't blame you.

643
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,924
How you holding up?

644
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,691
-Oh, no.
-Not good, not good.

645
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,527
-How about you?
-Name's christian.

646
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,464
-Who do you play for?
-University of North Dakota.

647
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,196
Pass it! come on!
No!

648
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,328
No, no, no!

649
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,701
Get him to a point!

650
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,603
You're quarterbacking this play!

651
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,801
come on, Rizzo,
I got you running this play!

652
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,104
You're gonna run the bench.

653
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,475
Mac, get out here!

654
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,515
Boom, he can hit him.
Boom. Boom. Boom.

655
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,243
We're opening up options, see?

656
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,785
We've got four options
off one play, guys.

657
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,378
You guys got that?
Anybody have any questions?

658
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,755
Okay, let's go.

659
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,057
-What is he talking about?
-No clue.

660
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,594
20 of you are going
to Lake Placid.

661
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,099
6 are going home.

662
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,499
Who that is, believe it or not,
is up to you.

663
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,162
-How about you?
-Mark Pavelich.

664
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,069
-Who do you play for?
-U.M.D. Bulldogs.

665
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,508
Let's go!
Next line up!

666
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,204
All right, turn it up, boys.

667
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,768
Let's move it, Bah.

668
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,980
Get it up, get it up!

669
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,744
Eric, it's open!

670
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,513
Here you go, here you go!

671
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,418
They can't stop us yet.

672
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,514
Attaway, Buzzy.
Nice pass.

673
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,922
That was a good shot.

674
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:29,926
You three.

675
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,395
-Run that again.
-Again?

676
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,953
-All right.
-Let's go.

677
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,733
christ, we don't have a chance
in hell of winning.

678
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,497
So I understand how you feel.

679
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,935
Don't let them know that.

680
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:41,494
Yeah.

681
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,472
-All right.
-Thanks, coach.

682
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:46,870
The coneheads are coming in.

683
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,172
Who?

684
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,804
That's what the guys
have been calling them

685
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,611
'cause, well, they're
a little...[ whistles ]

686
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,514
You know, like the coneheads.

687
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,075
What's that?

688
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,588
Dan Akroyd, Jane curtin.

689
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,286
I guess it's off your radar.

690
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,360
come on in, boys.

691
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,022
Wanted to see us, coach?

692
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,896
Yeah, I'm thinking about

693
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,868
keeping the three of you
together on the same line.

694
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,970
Everybody okay with that?

695
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,904
-Yeah. Sure.
-Yeah.

696
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,738
How about you, Buzzy? You think
this works with Bah and Pav?

697
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,335
Yeah, it's going good.
Moving the puck well.

698
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,210
It's different
playing with them.

699
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,341
We just seem to always
find each other

700
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,977
at the other end of the ice
and make things happen.

701
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,213
Pass, shoot, score.

702
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,119
-Pass, shoot, and...
-Score.

703
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,651
Well, all right.

704
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,126
We'll see how she goes.

705
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,221
-All right.
-Thanks, coach.

706
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,890
Take it easy.

707
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,900
Rest up.

708
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,504
Well, looks like we're taking
a line of coneheads to Europe.

709
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:55,342
Yeah, if they can keep
their legs under them.

710
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,048
All right, Herb,
I'll see you next week.

711
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,846
Something on your mind, craig?

712
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,555
Or is that just
too far off my radar?

713
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,557
I don't think
you can push them this hard.

714
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,431
Not for six months.
It's too long.

715
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,993
-They're doing all right.
-Well, whole team's tired.

716
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,870
I know how hard
to push them, craig.

717
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,841
You sure about that?

718
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,707
You know why I had them
take that test?

719
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,110
Make sure I could
push them this hard.

720
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,671
I'll see you Monday.

721
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,650
All right.

722
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,714
Oh, wow. Dynamite.

723
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:18,057
Look over here, Phillie.
Section two, about four rows up.

724
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,756
Two girls. Blond.

725
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,162
Man, they're gorgeous.

726
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,698
What row?

727
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,206
About the seventh row up.
To the right.

728
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,504
Lovely blond girls.

729
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,009
Maybe we can take a few home.

730
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,103
Must be something in the water.

731
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,193
Get a whistle.

732
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,402
Good game.

733
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,198
-Good game.
-Good game.

734
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,546
Hold up, there.
Hold up, hold up.

735
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,587
Gotta get back on the ice.
Let's go.

736
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,418
-What for?
-You'll find out soon enough.

737
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,980
Let's go.
Back on the ice.

738
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:21,922
What for?

739
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,017
We'll find out in a minute,
won't we?

740
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,653
come on,
let's see what he wants.

741
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,027
Get a picture or something?

742
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,531
What's going on?

743
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,435
You guys don't want to
work during the game?

744
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,808
No problem.
We'll work now.

745
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,312
Goal line.

746
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,610
That one!

747
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,205
[ Whistle blows ]

748
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,424
Hustle!

749
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:43,073
Think you can win
on talent alone?

750
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:48,509
Gentlemen, you don't have enough
talent to win on talent alone.

751
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,910
Again.

752
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,743
[ Whistle blows ]

753
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,097
If you think you can come here

754
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,726
and play the Norwegian
National team and tie them

755
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,600
and then go to the Olympics
and win...

756
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,769
You got another thing coming.

757
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,950
You better think about
something else,

758
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,749
each and every one of you.

759
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,120
When you pull on that jersey,

760
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,853
you represent yourself
and your teammates.

761
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,794
And the name on the front is
a hell of a lot more important

762
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,229
than the one on the back!

763
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,425
Get that through your head!

764
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,695
Again!

765
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,196
[ Whistle blows ]

766
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:08,257
Win, lose, or tie, you're
gonna play like champions!

767
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,314
Again!

768
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,597
Kick it in the ass, Verchota!

769
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,466
You want to go home early?

770
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,766
Keep it going, Suter.

771
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,399
All the way to the line
and all the way back.

772
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,136
It's not that difficult.

773
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,609
Again!

774
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,774
Again.

775
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,345
Again!

776
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,347
Herb.

777
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,052
What?

778
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,497
The rink manager wants to clean
the ice and then go home.

779
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,660
Tell him to leave me the keys.
I'll lock up.

780
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,929
Again.

781
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,933
Again.

782
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,855
You keep playing this way,

783
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,726
you won't beat anybody who's
even good, let alone great.

784
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,355
You want to make this team,

785
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,559
then you better start playing
at a level

786
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,831
that's gonna force me
to keep you here.

787
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,337
Again!

788
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,005
Thank God.

789
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,076
Think we're getting out of here?

790
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:42,851
Hey.

791
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,785
Where you going?

792
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,982
Back on the line.

793
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:53,893
Again.

794
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:56,830
Send them.

795
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,876
Again.

796
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,371
Again.

797
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,915
How about it, Silky? You gonna
be the first one to quit on me?

798
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,548
How about you, O.c.?
You ready to go down?

799
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,854
Oh, I think I got
my money on you, Verchota.

800
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,587
You got a hot date
in about an hour,

801
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,859
but you're not looking too good

00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,528
but that wasn't enough.

962
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,159
Hundreds of lranians finally
overran the embassy compound,

963
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,261
seizing about 90 people,
mostly Americans.

964
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,102
The hostages, men and women,
were blindfolded

965
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,142
and herded into
the embassy's basement.

966
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,509
Earlier today, the
Ayatollah Khomeini publicly...

967
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,517
We gave those guys at Harvard
a good schooling.

968
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,984
Hey!

969
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,183
How about Johnson
and Mcclanahan now?

970
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,692
come on, that works.
Doesn't it?

971
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,820
They're starting to
come together.

972
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,594
Thanks for coming out.

973
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,360
I wouldn't have missed it.

974
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,129
-Hey, you beat Harvard.
-Yeah.

975
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,700
Well, I should
probably get going.

976
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,242
Yeah. Yeah.

977
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,775
I love you, Pop.

978
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,175
You too, son.

979
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,248
-Jimmy.
-Yeah?

980
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,188
You keep that glove up.

981
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,782
You got it.

982
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,529
Switch.

983
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,971
Rizzo's making dinner, boys.

984
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:46,633
You know there's gonna
be meatballs.

985
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,611
You boys keep eating them,
I'll keep making them.

986
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,239
I think you guys
are insane to eat that stuff.

987
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,613
No offense, Rizzo.

988
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,778
I wonder how it's gonna affect
the chemistry of the boys.

989
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,414
I don't know.
We'll see.

990
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:01,821
Timmy.

991
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:10,931
Who the hell is that?

992
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,729
What's he doing here?

993
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,168
How you doing, Tim?
Good to see you.

994
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,037
Thanks, coach.

995
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,076
Hey, Bah.

996
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,474
-Yeah?
-Who's that guy?

997
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,808
Timmy Harrer.
Plays for the Gophers.

998
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,780
Having a big year.

999
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,750
-What the hell's he doing here?
-No idea.

1000
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:30,880
Why is he here?

1001
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,286
Hey, you guys know
he was coming?

1002
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,620
So, listen, why don't you
warm up, stretch out,

1003
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,626
jump on Johnson's line
for the day, okay?

1004
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,127
Good to have you here.

1005
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,375
-See you, boys.
-See you.

1006
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,547
This is ridiculous.

1007
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,355
Don't worry about it, Rammer.
It'll be all right.

1008
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,089
Right, O.c.?

1009
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,030
Herb's not gonna do
a damn thing, boys.

1010
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,431
He's just messing
with our minds.

1011
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,997
Oh, you think so, Jack?

1012
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,403
Yeah, I do.

1013
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,876
Well, we all know Herb made
the Olympic team back in '60.

1014
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,468
So?

1015
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,070
So, a week before the games,

1016
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,844
coach Riley calls him into
his office and sends him home.

1017
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,317
What's your point?

1018
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,048
My point, Jack,
is that one week later,

1019
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,885
Herb's on his couch
with his old man,

1020
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,551
watching his team win
the gold medal.

1021
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,117
come that close and get nothing?

1022
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,460
He'll do whatever it takes.

1023
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:51,160
That's my point.

1024
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,537
Yeah, I'm aware of that, Walter.

1025
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,200
Yeah.

1026
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:04,007
Yeah, well, you've talked to
everybody else then, all right.

1027
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,947
Nothing else we can do, then.
Thank you, Walter.

1028
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,477
Is everything okay?

1029
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:15,656
Walter says that there's talk
carter may boycott

1030
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,193
the Moscow games next summer.

1031
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,790
So if we don't go there,
they might not come here, right?

1032
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,165
Right.

1033
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,305
Don't do this to yourself, Herb.

1034
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:37,044
There are things you can control
and things you can't.

1035
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,705
No milk.

1036
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,611
Herb.

1037
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,843
Yeah, I heard you, honey.

1038
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,527
You'll still have everything
you won here.

1039
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,961
Don't tell me
what I'll have, Patti.

1040
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,625
You don't know this enough
to tell me that.

1041
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:02,969
You know, I understand
you being upset with me

1042
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,769
when I say you work too hard
teaching a simple game.

1043
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,902
But don't ever criticize me
for caring about you.

1044

[ Whistle blows ]

come on, boys, push it.

Here we go! Push it!
Go now! Move!

1047
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:22,822
Damn it!

1048
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,088
come on, Rizzo.

1049
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:26,425
I know, coach.

1050
00:59:26,497 --> 00:59:28,362
-I know.
-You know?

1051
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:31,993
If you knew,
then why did you do it again?

1052
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,634
You start putting
the puck in the net,

1053
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:36,866
or you're not going anywhere.

1054
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,199
And don't think I won't do it.

1055
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,336
Johnson, line up!
Let's go!

1056

come on!
Shoot it!

-Now move it up!
-Go, Mike, go!

1061
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:57,593
Drop it back.

1062
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:59,356
Go to the net, Timmy!
Go to the net!

1063
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,454
Go, go, go!

Yeah!

01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,563
Nice play, boys.
Nice play.

Let's go.

1069
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,074
come on, boys.

01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,579
Let's go, boys!

Timmy.

1072
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:27,351
You keep driving the net.
That's all I care about, okay?

1073
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:30,450
That puck goes across the
blue line, you drive to the net.

1074
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:31,619
Okay.

1075
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:32,992
All right.

1076
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:02,286
Herb.

1077
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:04,589
Some of the boys
want to have a word.

1078
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,253
What about?

1079
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,458
I think you ought to
hear them out.

1080
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:23,405
This had better take
about two minutes.

1081
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:31,318
This is crazy, Herb.
Bringing him in this late.

1082
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:33,982
Hey, we got parents buying
tickets, getting rooms.

1083
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,753
What are we
supposed to tell them?

1084
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:37,657
And with one of us
going home as it is?

1085
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:40,663
I don't have to ask where
you stand on this, huh, Rizzo?

1086
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:42,528
This wasn't Rizzo's idea.

1087
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:45,761
You want me to say
I'm scared of getting cut?

1088
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,430
I'm scared of getting cut.
Everybody is.

1089
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:49,597
We just want it to be fair.

1090
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:52,073
Don't even try telling me that.
He was in colorado.

1091
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,302
That was 6 months ago.

1092
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,072
You don't think he's been
playing for the last 6 months?

1093
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:56,806
-Not with us, he hasn't.
-So?

1094
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,677
-So there's a difference.
-Like hell there is!

1095
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:01,149
All I know is that kid
can flat-out play.

1096
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:01,843
We can't?

1097
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:04,979
He moves the puck, he's got
great vision on the ice.

1098
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,955
That's not the point!

1099
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,821
I'll tell you
something else he's got.

1100
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,690
He's got the attitude I want
on and off the ice,

1101
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:13,389
so somebody better explain to me

1102
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:15,295
why I shouldn't be
giving him a look.

1103
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,265
Because we're a family.

1104
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:19,728
What?

1105
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:22,532
We're a family.

1106
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:25,438
A family?

1107
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,301
Yeah.

1108
01:02:28,045 --> 01:02:29,307
Yeah.

1109
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:37,979
And this is the family you want
to go to Lake Placid with?

1110
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:39,147
Definitely.

1111
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:41,123
-Yeah, without a doubt.
-Absolutely.

1112
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,783
Wouldn't have it any other way.

1113
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:47,993
Timmy Harrer can help us, boys.

1114
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:49,989
And I'm gonna send him home.

1115
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:53,828
We got one more
to get down to 20.

1116
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,337
You understand.

1117
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:56,429
Yep.

1118
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:01,535
Looks like you got

PRESlDENT cARTER: The erosion
of our confidence in the future

1172
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:29,458
is threatening to destroy

1173
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:34,589
the social and the political
fabric of America.

1174
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:38,328
The confidence that we have
always had as a people

1175
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:41,633
is not simply
some romantic dream

1176
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:44,367
or a proverb in a dusty book

1177
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,706
that we read
just on the Fourth of July.

1178
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:50,172
It is the idea
which founded our nation

1179
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:53,239
and has guided
our development as a people.

1180
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:56,980
confidence in the future
has supported everything else.

1181
01:05:57,054 --> 01:06:01,115
We've always believed in
something called "progress."

1182
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:04,991
We've always had a faith
that the days of our children

1183
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:08,657
will be better than our own.

1184
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:12,896
Our people are losing
that faith.

1185
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:16,232
For the first time
in the history of our country,

1186
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:21,437
a majority of our people believe
that the next five years

1187
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:25,208
will be worse than
the past five years.

1188
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:31,378
We were taught that our armies
were always invincible,

1189
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:34,856
and our causes were always just,

1190
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:38,759
only to suffer
the agony of Vietnam.

1191
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:45,534
We respected the presidency
as a place of honor

1192
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,503
until the shock of Watergate.

1193
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:55,043
We've got to stop crying
and start sweating.

1194
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:59,979
Stop talking and start walking.

stopped by Jimmy craig,
and it goes into the corner.

1278
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:46,517
Finally Team USA
gets its stick on the puck

1279
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,490
as Ramsey brings it up
to the blue line.

1280
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:52,960
He's absolutely flattened there
by Kasatonov.

1281
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:54,394
HERB:
Two-on-one!

1282
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:56,796
Team Soviet Union turning it
into a two-on-one.

1283
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:58,163
Back door, O.c., look out!

1284
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:00,464
Get the puck!

1285
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:03,802
Moving in to the boards,
shoots and scores.

1286
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:07,676
come on!

1287
01:14:10,213 --> 01:14:12,306
Hey, break it up!
Break it up!

1288
01:14:12,382 --> 01:14:14,816
That's it.
Let's go.

1289
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:17,011
That's a nice expression
on your face.

1290
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,713
Let's get it back, boys.

1291
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,415
Get it back!

1292
01:14:22,258 --> 01:14:24,920
HERB:
Jack, you gotta listen to me!

1293
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,552
You gotta listen to me!

1294
01:14:27,305 --> 01:14:33,494
