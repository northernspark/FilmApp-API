No disrespect, Tommy.

Why would Rothstein
wanna do business
with bums like us?

174

'Cause some of us

You'll find out Monday night

Mr. Luciano,

188
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,841
you're walking
down the street.

189
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,611
Suddenly you realize
you're being followed.
lt's a hit.

190
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,580
Walking toward you
is a second gunman.

191
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,183
You have time to fire at only
one of them. Which one do. . .

192

l don't accept the question.
To live, l got to
kill 'em both.

193
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,291

l don't have a wife.

Why not?

196
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,997
Emotion is dangerous.

Aren't you human?

198
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,973
Would it help?

199
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:01,540
Next. l have ships
and distilleries in Scotland.

200
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,909
l need distribution
in New York.

201
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,544
Masseria? Faranzano?

202
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,213
They'd kill me.

203

You have Jewish partners.

205
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,791
Maybe l'd kill them too.

206
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,358
You can't afford to.

207
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
You're in the squeeze.

208
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,864
Masseria has 700 soldiers.
Faranzano, 600.

209
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,971
Either one realizes you exist,
they'd squash you like an ant.

210
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,115
Unless l get
a powerful friend.

211

But you, you'll never

lt's big enough for us
to have a party.

Siegel, drop it!

1288
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,655
All right, Lansky,
over there.

1289
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:18,728
You too, Costello.
Over with your Yid friends.

This is pretty.

1292
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:26,400
Kill 'em !

1293
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,743
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1294
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:31,672
How much is it worth?

1295
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:34,442
Anything ! Hundred grand !

1296
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:35,977
You don't like yourself much.

1297
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:37,012
Two hundred !

1298
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:42,083
Five. Come on, say it!
Five!

1299
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:43,985
All right, five.

1300
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:46,863
Truth is, l like my work.
l would've done it
for nothing.

1301
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:49,360
Okay, boys.

That's number three, Meyer.

1305
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:12,651
This time l want you
to thank me.

1306
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,915
Thank you.

1307
01:34:14,915 --> 01:34:17,861
No, you crazy Jews!

1308
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:23,224
Remember this?

1309
01:34:23,224 --> 01:34:25,860
Sicilian law, remember?
You kill a don. . .

1310
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,930
All right.
Just do like l said.

1311
01:34:28,129 --> 01:34:29,196
Slow.

1312
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:30,265
What are you doing?

1313
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:35,369
Why slowly?
'Cause l tortured you?

1314
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:38,606
No, no, no.
lt's what you did
1 5 years ago.

1315
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:42,417
Jesus! You want revenge
after 1 5 years?

1316
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:45,046
l've been busy.

1317
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:47,181
Get up!

1318
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:50,051
At least tell me

1319
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:52,887
what l did 1 5 years ago.

1320
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:55,690
No!
CHARLlE: Want me to tell you?

1321
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,464
Wanna know what you did?

1322
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:02,004
Tell me, what'd l do
1 5 years ago?

1323
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:04,532
You destroyed my father!

1324
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:09,003
Your father?
l don't even remember
your father!

1325
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,047
Exactly.

1326
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:16,377
Charlie.

No, no, please!

Sit.

1333
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:54,686
l want to thank Mr. Capone
for hosting this meeting.

1334
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:57,489
Sit down and shut up,
will you?

1335
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:02,160
There ain't gonna be a boss.

1336
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:07,766
You all know how l got this.

1337
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:10,731
Maybe Joe Profaci here. . .

1338
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:12,867
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1339
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:15,369
Don't worry.

1340
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:18,506
Maybe you knew it was
gonna happen to me,

1341
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:20,474
maybe you didn't.

1342
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:23,844
But by the old way
of doing things,
if l become boss now,

1343
01:36:23,844 --> 01:36:26,415
l have to hit you
in case you knew.

1344
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:29,750
And all of you shrug, right?

1345
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:33,554
Except some of you
are friends of Joe's.

1346
01:36:33,554 --> 01:36:37,358
And one day
l might do something

1347
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:40,861
that upsets you,
then you'll hit me.

1348
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:45,605
Then you become boss.
My friends, they hate you.

1349
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:49,703
Somebody else becomes boss,
and on, and on, and on.

1350
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:53,607
Know what l call that?
Stupid. Very stupid.

1351
01:36:53,607 --> 01:36:57,350
So, if you ain't doing it,
who's gonna be. . .

1352
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:01,285
Nobody.
We're all bosses here.

1353
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:05,786
What then, Charlie?
We're gonna vote
on everything?

1354
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:10,064
That's right.
Everybody here is equal.

1355
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:15,507
Corporations have
a board of directors.

1356
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:19,644
So will we.
A commission.

1357
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:25,039
Now, l have friends.
They're not from Palermo,

1358
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:28,309
not from Sicily. . .
They're not even ltalians.

1359
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:31,312
They're Jewish.
And l trust 'em.

1360
01:37:31,912 --> 01:37:33,781
Anybody have a problem
with that?

1361
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:37,351
You say there's gonna be
no boss, but you're starting
to talk like one.

1362
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:38,786
l've learned.

1363
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:41,289
Every organization
needs somebody

1364
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:43,891
standing out front.

1365
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:49,238
Call it a figurehead,
a leader, whatever.

1366
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:51,809
lt doesn't much matter
to me who does it.

1367
01:37:55,736 --> 01:38:00,480
l say we make Charlie Luciano
head of our
national commission.

1368
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,153
Who agrees?

1369
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,222
You want it, Al?
lt's yours.

1370
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:18,759
Hell, no.
l want you to do it.

1371
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:21,495
lt's just Julius Caesar
never took no vote.

1372
01:38:21,495 --> 01:38:25,340
That's why Caesar ended up
dead in the street.

1373
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:35,280
Any other business?
