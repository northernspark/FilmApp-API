- Trust me.
- l trust 1 person. You talk to her.

13
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,200
Good boy.

Mr. Shang Tsung?

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,000
Now, you're sure she'll follow me?

20
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,000
You killed her partner, didn't you?

21
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,400
She'll follow you into hell.

22

Just make sure she's on that boat.

how to do this stuff?

- Cut. Reset. Back in 15.
- l won't do it again.

The press is still giving you
a hard time.

53
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,500
Yeah, they think l'm a fake.

54

You're one of the best
martial artists in the world...

Prove it? How?

57
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,300
A tournament.

58
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,800
The tournament.

59

lt's held once a generation.

Yes.

71

This is where we found his body.

72
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,700
What happened?

73
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
After you left for America...

74
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,500
he followed in your footsteps.

75
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,300
Preparing for the tournament.

76
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Grandfather ... it wasn't enough
to fill my head with that nonsense?

77
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,200
To save the world is not nonsense.

78
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,600
Men fighting in a simple contest
don't decide these things.

79
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,400
How can a wise man believe this?

80
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,400
We all believe in it...

81

He is the Chosen One.

84
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,000
No. He left our temple.
Turned his back on us.

85
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,000
Why have you come back?

86
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,500
l want to represent the Order of Light
at the Tournament.

87
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,200
For what reason?

88
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,100
My brother's killer will be there.

89
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,300
That cannot be your only reason
for going...

90
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,500
or you will fail.

91
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,200
Oh yes, l forgot.

92
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,300
We're fighting for the fate
of the world.

93
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,600
That's why you left the temple...

94
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,500
and ran away, isn't it?

95
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,100
The Great Tournament
was too much responsibility.

96
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,600
But vengeance...

97
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,000
that's so much simpler.

98
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,000
Lord Rayden.

99
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,000
You're still running away
from your destiny.

100
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Rayden?

101
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,600
Grandfather, get up.

102
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,500
This isn't your God of Thunder.

103
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
- He's a beggar.
- Spare him, my Lord Rayden.

104
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,700
American life has enfeebled his mind.

105
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,700
Too much television.

106
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,300
So, you're going to
win the tournament?

107
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,700
- Yes, l am.
- Show me how.

108
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,800
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid...

109
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,500
of a simple beggar?

110
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,300
lf you are Rayden...

111
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,700
why did you let Chan die?

112
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,300
- Why didn't you protect him?
- Why didn't you?

113
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,900
l've had enough of this.

114
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,500
l'll find my brother's killer
at the tournament.

115
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,800
With or without your consent.

116
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,100
He isn't ready, my Lord...

117
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
and we lost so much time.

118
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,300
l know.

119
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,100
But there is no one else.

Aren't you Art Lean?

125
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
l saw you fight in London,
you're great.

126
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,600
Thanks. l saw some of your films.
You can't fake those moves.

127
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,800
Yeah, well, tell that to the press.

128
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,100
Pal, when the ship comes in...

129
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,500
could you put these on board?

130
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
You want me to carry your luggage?

131
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,300
l pay money. You carry bags.

132
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,400
- Or is that too complicated?
- No.

133
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,600
l got it.

134
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,100
Good.

135
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank God l didn't ask him
to park the car.

136
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,400
Nothing says that creep at the club
wasn't lying.

137
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,900
Kano could be 1[ miles
from here by now.

138
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,200
What is that?

139
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
You must be kidding me.

140
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Wait.

141
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's it, Blade...

Hey, Sonya!

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,300
Hey, you.

Alright, tough guy, you want to get...

147
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,900
tough?

No. Do you?

152

But l can help you find him.

153
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,900
Out of my way.

154
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,700
Just another starstruck fan, huh?

155
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,300
l'm honored to finally meet you.

156

When l want back-up
l'll radio for it.

164
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Got that radio handy?

165
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,700
Scorpion and Sub-Zero.

166
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,100
The deadliest of enemies...

167
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,300
but slaves under my power.

168
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,700
Move aside.

169
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,600
- Enough.
- Lord Rayden.

170
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,000
How good of you to grace us
with your...

171
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,900
presence.

172
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,800
Your sideshow freaks
attacked my fighters.

173
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,600
That is expressly forbidden
before the tournament...

174
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
as your emperor well knows.

175
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,300
My sincere apologies.

176
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,500
lt won't happen again,
l promise you.

177
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,900
- l shall see to that.
- Of course.

178
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,100
Until we reach the island...

179
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,100
where you have no dominion.

180
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,700
My dominions are well known to me,
sorcerer.

181
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,300
- Thank you.
- What tournament?

182
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,300
You've been chosen, Sonya.

183
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,500
Much to my delight.

184
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,000
You really are Rayden.

185
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
Come with me.

186
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,200
1 guy with things coming
out of his hand, 1 who freezes stuff...

187
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,700
and 1 man who seems to be made
out of electricity.

188
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,300
How did he disappear?
What's going on? Who is he?

189
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Let's think this through.

190
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,500
There is a rational explanation.

191
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,300
He's Rayden, God of Lightening
and Protector of the Realm of Earth.

192
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,600
- Great.
- There's your rational explanation.

193
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,100
Listen.

194
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
What you're about to face is...

195
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
vastly more important than...

196
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,000
your ego...

197
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,700
your enemy...

198
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,400
or your quest for revenge.
You have embarked...

199
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,900
on a sacred mission.

200
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,500
You have been chosen to defend
the Realm of Earth...

201
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,500
in a tournament called Mortal Kombat.

202
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,200
Defend it from who?

203
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,100
Your world is but
one of many realms.

204
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,700
One of them is a forsaken land
called Outworld...

205
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,500
ruled by an immortal
who has crowned himself emperor.

206
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Now he seeks a new world
to conquer and enslave.

207
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,000
Now, wait a second.

208
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,400
lf this guy is so powerful...

209
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,300
why doesn't he invade us?

210
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,500
To enter the Realm of Earth

211
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,200
the Emperor's demon sorcerer,
Shang Tsung...

212
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,400
and his warriors must win 10 straight
victories in Mortal Kombat.

213
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,400
They have won nine.

214
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
This will be the tenth.

215
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,600
A handful of people on a leaky boat
are going to save the world?

216
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,000
Exactly.

217
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,900
The essence of Mortal Kombat...

218
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,500
is not about death...

219
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
but life.

220
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
Mortal men and women...

221
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,400
defending your own world.

222
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Why are you telling me this?

223
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,400
What about the others?

224
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,700
They are all great fighters...

225
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
but l have looked
into their souls...

226
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,500
and yours.

227
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,200
One of you will decide
the outcome of the tournament.

228
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,400
The fate...

229
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,100
of billions will depend upon you.

230
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,600
Sorry.

231
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,800
What about Shang Tsung?

232
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,600
Oh, still concerned
only with vengeance?

233
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,700
lf you challenge Shang Tsung now...

234
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,100
you'll lose your life and your soul.

235
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,300
He'll pay for my brother's death.

236
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're not ready.

237
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Look.

238
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,300
lt has begun.

239
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
lt has begun.

240
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,600
Black Hawk to Cardinal.

241
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,500
Black Hawk calling Cardinal.
ls anybody monitoring?

242
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,300
Jaxx, this is Sonya.
Do you copy?

243
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,500
While you're at it,
call my agent.

244
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,900
Do l look like your secretary?

245
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,800
What are you doing?

246
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,000
The electrical disturbance
blew out the transistors.

247
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Your radio equipment's fine.

248
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Look at your compass.

249
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,900
Where the hell are we?

250
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
- Do l look like your travel agent?
- Fine.

251
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,900
Okay...

252
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,600
l give up.

253
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,500
What's going on?

254
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,300
l don't know.

255
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,900
But what if all the legends
were true?

256
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,800
What legends?

257
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,000
Do you need help with those?

258
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,900
Ah, no more steps.

259
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,500
Great! Can't wait
to see the bathrooms.

260
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,700
You know?

261
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,800
When a woman looks at you like that...

262
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,900
it usually means something.

263
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,700
Princess Kitana.

264
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,500
She's our most dangerous adversary.

265
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
Watch her carefully, Reptile.

266
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,500
Keep her away from these humans.

267
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,400
Welcome.

268
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,000
You're here to compete in...

269
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
Mortal Kombat.

270
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,600
Tomorrow morning the great
combat begins.

271
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,200
Some will have the distinct honor...

272
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,800
and pleasure...

273
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,300
to face Prince Goro...

274
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,900
our reigning champion.

275
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,700
You are witnesses to a great
turning point in the history...

276
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,700
of your planet.

277
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,000
Treasure these moments...

278
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
as if they were your last.

279
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,000
Now, for a taste of things to come...

280
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,200
Flawless victory.

281
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,900
''Come to a little tournament,'' he said.
''Be good for the career,'' he said.

282
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,700
Yeah, right.

283
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Liu.

284
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,200
- Where are you going?
- After Shang Tsung.

285
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,200
You can't go after him.
Remember what Rayden said?

286
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,100
He didn't say anything to me.
He knows where Kano's hiding.

287
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,900
You know, you've got to admire her.

288
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,200
When she sets her mind on something...

289
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,500
lt's not her mind you're admiring.

290
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,000
True.

291
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,100
How many times must l tell you?
l don't need your help.

292
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,100
l can take care of myself.

293
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
We can't help it.
lt's a guy thing.

294
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,200
- Where are you going?
- l'm following him.

295
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,400
- l work alone.
- No, Shang Tsung is mine.

296
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,200
Let's forget about Shang.

297
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Forget about him?

298
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,600
l want to get to the bottom of this.

299
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,600
Are you out of your mind?

300
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Sonya...

301
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,900
You go ahead. Find out
what that was.

302
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,500
Liu and l'll wait right here.

303
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,800
What?

304
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,300
See, me... l believe
in a fair fight.

305
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,700
You know, one-on-one,
man-to-man...

306
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,200
hand to hand.
Like my daddy taught me.

307
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,000
But what l just saw
wasn't very fair.

308
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,300
That's Kano.

309
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Forget about Kano.

310
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,000
Who's the other guy?

311
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Then he freezes this guy, right?

312
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,900
And then he explodes.
l could see his guts and everything.

313
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,300
Almost lost my lunch.

314
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,500
Disgusting.

315
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,600
What l want to know...
if this Shang Tsung guy's so great...

316
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,700
how come he's got such a
crummy looking boat?

317
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,500
Well, anyway, guy gives me the creeps.

318
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,400
''Treasure these moments''.

319
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,400
That was his intention.

320
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,800
Shang Tsung is a great sorcerer.

321
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,100
The wise cultivate his favor.

322
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,100
Those who challenge his power...

323
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,400
become his slaves.

324
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah?

325
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,200
l haven't seen any of them around.

326
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,300
You fool!

327
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,000
You know nothing.

328
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,800
He enslaves souls.

329
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,400
He learned the black arts
from the Emperor himself.

330
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,700
You're some kind of royalty too...

331
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,300
- right?
- l am Goro!

332
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,300
general of the armies
of Outworld and prince...

333
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,700
of the subterranean realm of Shokan.

334
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Subterranean?

335
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,400
What's that,
something like underground?

336
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,900
Yes, something like...

337
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
that.

338
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,900
l'm kind of an underworld boss.

339
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,500
Well... l mean, back home.

340
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,300
How lucky for them...

341
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,300
''back home''.

342
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,700
lt's true...

343
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,800
Prince Goro.

344
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,300
Why else would l have chosen
such a disreputable looking cretin?

345
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,200
Look at him.

346
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,800
No dignity...

347
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,400
no manners.

348
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,400
Yet in the realm of Earth...

349
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,100
such men can amass great wealth...

350
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,500
and almost godlike power.

351
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,000
l'd get back to my amassing
as soon as possible, if you don't mind.

352
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,100
Now, when do l get paid?

353
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,700
After you've fought the girl.
But remember...

354
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,800
she's not to be harmed,
only humiliated.

355
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,800
l have plans for my beautiful Sonya.

356
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,100
To what do we owe the honor
of your visit, Shang Tsung?

357
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,900
To warn you Kung Lao's descendant
is competing in the tournament.

358
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,400
- Handle him carefully.
- l saw this Liu Kang in the hall.

359
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,200
He'll pose no problem.

360
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,100
This is no time for
foolish pride.

361
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,700
We've never been
so close to victory.

362
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,100
Which is why l've come
to warn you of another danger.

363
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,400
Princess Kitana.

364
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,400
The Emperor's adopted daughter?

365
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,600
Why should l worry about her?

366
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,900
Princess Kitana
is 10,000 years old...

367
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,600
and the rightful heir to the
throne of Outworld.

368
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,200
She must not join the forces
from the Realm of Earth...

369
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,700
especially Liu Kang.

370
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
What's so special about you?

371
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,600
l don't know.

372
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,100
The Emperor will not
tolerate failure...

373
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,400
and neither will l.

374
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,500
l do not fail.

375
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
Let's get out of here.

376
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,500
What? What is it?

377
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,700
We are not alone.

378
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,300
Wait a second,
l don't remember this.

379
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,800
Look!

380
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,500
That has to be Princess Kitana.

381
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,900
She's trying to help us.

382
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,200
- You're hard up for a date.
- Come on.

383
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,600
Forget her. She's 10,000 years old.

384
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
- So what?
- Liu?

385
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,900
- What happened?
- There's something here.

386
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,100
lt's following Princess Kitana.

387
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,300
Where is she?

388
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,500
l don't know.

389
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,800
- Where are we going?
- l know exactly where we're going.

390
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,800
Kitana went this way.

391
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,400
l can smell her perfume.

392
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,900
l don't smell anything.

393
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,700
l smell something.

394
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,200
Bullshit.

395
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
We got company.

396
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,400
Just the way l like them.

397
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,700
Dumb and ugly.

398
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,600
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of cake, huh?

399
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,800
- Well, it was easy for me.
- Get over yourself.

400
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,600
What is it with you guys?

401
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,500
We're standing...
they're not.

402
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,500
What more do you want?

403
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,900
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

404
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,700
So, why don't you show me
what you plan to do about...

405
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,800
them?

406
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,900
l don't think so.

407
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,700
You'll find that this
is the way out.

408
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,600
You guys are lucky he stopped us.

409
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,500
- So, you've seen what you'll face?
- You mean Goro?

410
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,600
- And Shang Tsung.
- Will he fight in the tournament?

411
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,500
lf he chooses to.

412
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,200
As a former champion
he has the right to do so.

413
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,300
And he's far more dangerous
than Goro.

414
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,400
His power comes from the souls
of vanquished warriors.

415
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
To fight Shang Tsung...

416
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
is to face not one...

417
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,900
but a legion of adversaries.

418
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,600
Remember that.

419
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,900
Tomorrow the tournament begins.

420
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,400
Be prepared.

421
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,200
From this moment on...

422
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,500
my island will be your battleground.

423
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,400
Liu Kang!

424
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,700
You will be first.

425
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,300
Let Mortal Kombat begin.

426
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,000
- Let's go!
- Yes!

427
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,900
Your soul is mine.

428
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,100
Fatality.

429
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,400
Sonya Blade!

430
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
l have something for you, my dear.

431
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,600
l don't want anything from you.

432
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,100
On the contrary.

433
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,800
l have something you want very much.

434
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,000
You can thank me later.

435
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,300
Hello, baby.

436
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,300
Did you miss me?

437
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Now look at this.

438
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,200
This little baby
brings back memories, doesn't it?

439
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,900
You used it to knife your mother
in the back?

440
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,100
lt put a big smile on your
partner, though. Ear...

441
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,000
to ear...

442
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,300
Give it up. l've studied
all your moves.

443
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Study this.

444
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,000
Does it hurt, baby?

445
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,400
Right. Finish him.

446
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,700
No, Sonya. Don't!

447
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,300
- Give me a break!
- Okay.

448
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,800
Get over here!

449
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,400
Come here!

450
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,800
Welcome!

451
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,000
Get down here!

452
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,900
''To my Greatest Fan
Johnny Cage''

453
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,200
Begin!

454
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,700
Fight with all of your heart
or there is no hope.

455
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,600
Why do you care if l win?

456
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,600
To win your next match,
use the element which brings life.

457
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,700
What?

458
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,900
Kitana!

459
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,700
Remember my words.

460
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
That's enough!

461
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,500
You disappoint me.

462
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,000
Not very wise.

463
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,600
Use the element which brings life.

464
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,600
Water.

465
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,300
ls it time?

466
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,200
Yes.

467
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,700
We've let these humans win enough.

468
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,600
At last.

469
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,400
What the...?

470
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,500
Yeah, that's it! ln and out!

471
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,100
Come on. You can do it!

472
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,700
Move! Use your feet.

473
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,900
Kick him!

474
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,000
Come on, Art. Get up!

475
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,600
Get out!

476
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,400
Finish him.

477
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,000
Get out!

478
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,300
Goro! Goro!

479
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,600
Yes! Goro!

480
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,500
Finish him!

481
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,500
Time to die.

482
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Finish him.

483
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,900
Flawless victory.

484
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,600
Your soul is mine!

485
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,600
We can't win!

486
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,800
How can we possibly beat
something like that?

487
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,500
Good question.

488
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,600
Goro can be killed.

489
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,300
Shang Tsung's power can be destroyed
by mortal men and women.

490
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,800
You can overcome any adversary...

491
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,700
no matter how bizarre
their powers may seem.

492
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,600
There is always a way.

493
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,000
Only one thing can defeat you:

494
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,200
Your own fear.

495
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,500
So, who says we're afraid?

496
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,000
You must first face your fears...

497
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,900
if you are to conquer them.

498
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,400
You, Johnny, are afraid
you're a fake...

499
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,500
so you'll rush into any fight
just to prove you're not.

500
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,400
You'll fight...

501
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,400
bravely enough...

502
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,200
but foolishly...

503
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,200
carelessly...

504
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,300
and you'll be beaten.

505
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,100
You, Sonya...

506
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,200
are afraid to admit even you
sometimes need help.

507
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,400
lf you are afraid to trust...

508
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,500
you will lose.

509
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,800
Wait.

510
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,500
Wait.

511
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,800
What about me?

512
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,400
Oh, you.

513
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,200
You fear your own destiny.

514
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,900
You already fled once
when you went to America, so...

515
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
you're guilty about Chan's death.

516
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,300
l am responsible for Chan's death.

517
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,700
Every mortal is responsible
for his own destiny.

518
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,400
Chan believed this.
Why can't you?

519
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,400
l tried.

520
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,200
Despair is the most dangerous fear.

521
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,300
l know this...

522
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,600
and so does Shang Tsung.

523
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,500
He can peer into your soul...

524
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,300
and use the fear he sees against you.

525
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,400
You must be prepared.

526
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,200
Liu!

527
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,800
You will be next.

528
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,400
Goro's never been beaten.

529
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,700
You go up against him,
he'll kill you.

530
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,200
lf l don't...

531
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,000
then he'll finish us off
one at a time.

532
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,500
lf l challenge him now...

533
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,000
l can finish this.

534
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,900
You're making this sound simple
and it isn't.

535
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,600
Yeah, it is.

536
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,700
'Cause l can't let what happened
to Art happen to you.

537
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,800
Not to you.

538
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,700
Oh, don't you dare do this
to protect me, Johnny Cage.

539
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,400
Trust me. l've a plan.

540
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,900
l don't believe this!
You are the most egotistical...

541
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,700
self-deluded person l have ever met.

542
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,800
You forgot ''good looking.''

543
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,900
Challenging Goro, eh?

544
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:11,100
You weren't supposed
to fight him now.

545
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,700
Are you that eager to die?

546
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,300
l'm not the one who'll die.

547
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,100
l see.

548
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,600
You're very foolish.

549
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,400
The true sign of a hero.

550
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,600
You want to protect your friends.

551
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,300
But make no mistake.

552
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,700
They too will die...

553
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,400
after Goro destroys you.

554
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,000
So what's the problem?

555
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,100
As you wish.

556
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,400
As absurd as your request is,
l shall grant it.

557
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,400
ln return l reserve the right
to challenge the winner myself.

558
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,100
Or another of my choosing.

559
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,200
ln a place designated by me
for the final battle...

560
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,800
of the tournament.

561
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,900
- You got it, pal.
- l don't think so.

562
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,400
Too late, Lord Rayden.

563
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,500
The rules are quite clear.

564
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,400
lt's... How do you say?

565
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,100
''A deal's a deal.''

566
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,100
What have you done?

567
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,400
l made a choice.

568
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,800
This is our tournament, remember?

569
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,300
Mortal Kombat.

570
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,300
We fight it.

571
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,800
Good.

572
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,700
At last one of them has understood.

573
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,200
Goro! Goro!

574
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,900
Finish him quickly.

575
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,700
Pay me my tribute.

576
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:03,300
This puny mortal
will be no problem.

577
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,600
l'll crush him in one blow.

578
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,300
Alright.

579
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,600
Let's dance.

580
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,300
Yes! Sorry.

581
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,500
You imbecile.

582
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,600
Damn, that hurt.

583
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,600
Follow him.

584
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Finish him.

585
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,000
- Yes! Yes!
- Goro! Goro!

586
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,000
Finish him! Finish him!

587
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,500
Those were $5[ sunglasses,
asshole.

588
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,000
This is where you fall down.

589
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,700
Let me go!

590
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,000
Stop!

591
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,700
l hereby exercise my right
to challenge.

592
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,100
l challenge her.

593
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,600
You're a coward, sorcerer.

594
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,100
Stand and fight.

595
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,700
We had a deal, remember?

596
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,700
Mortal Kombat continues.
l'm simply...

597
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,700
changing the place...

598
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,100
as we agreed.

599
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,900
- Sonya!
- Wait!

600
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,400
- Where's he taken her?
- To the Emperor's castle...

601
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,800
in the wastelands of Outworld,
where l cannot follow.

602
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,800
We can.

603
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,600
Rayden...Can Sonya
beat Shang Tsung?

604
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:01,500
l'm sorry.

605
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,200
- You're sorry.
- There is one last rule.

606
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,600
Neglected to mention it.

607
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,600
She must accept the challenge
or there'll be no final combat.

608
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,700
l have nothing further
to teach you, Liu Kang.

609
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,500
You possess the knowledge.

610
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,200
All that is lacking now is the will.

611
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,500
You sure you don't want to go?

612
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,300
ln Outworld, if you look
hard enough...

613
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,300
you will find another guide.

614
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,200
Good luck.

615
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,100
They'll need it.

616
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,200
This is not good.

617
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,600
But l'm fine.

618
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,800
l can deal with this.

619
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,600
So... this is Outworld.

620
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,500
l can see why they want
a change of scenery.

621
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,600
We should head for that tower.

622
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,000
He'd have taken Sonya there.

623
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,300
l hate this place.

624
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,400
l do. l'm telling you l hate it.

625
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,200
A hostile environment,
l'm unprepared...

626
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:46,000
with people who want to kick my ass.

627
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,400
lt's like being back in high school!

628
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,600
What's that?

629
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,500
Wait.

630
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,500
What?

631
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,100
There's something else.

632
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,600
Oh, great.

633
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,400
What are you doing?

634
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,500
What are you doing?

635
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,500
Reptile.

636
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,100
Oh no, you don't.

637
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,800
Well done.

638
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,900
You're finally learning, Liu Kang.

639
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,400
Kitana.

640
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,400
Come with me.

641
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,100
What happened here?

642
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,700
The same thing that will happen
to your world...

643
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,800
unless you prevent it.

644
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,200
My father was the rightful ruler
of Outworld

645
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,800
Then his best warriors
lost ten Mortal Kombats...

646
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,400
and the Emperor entered the Realm...

647
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,100
killed my parents and adopted me...

648
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,200
to lay claim to the throne.

649
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,000
but it was beautiful once...

650
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:46,200
before Shang Tsung engineered
its destruction.

651
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,400
How can l stop this from happening
in my world?

652
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,800
lf l did not believe in you...

653
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,700
l would not have helped you.

654
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,700
ln the Black Tower you will face
three challenges.

655
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,400
You must face your enemy.
You must face yourself.

656
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,600
And you must face your worst fear.

657
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,900
l will not fight you, Shang Tsung.

658
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,700
l am not playing your game.

659
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,800
My sweet Sonya.

660
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,900
There's no one else.

661
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,000
lf you don't fight...

662
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,600
the Realm of Earth will
forfeit the Tournament...

663
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,600
and its portals will open...

664
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,500
to our great Emperor.

665
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,300
You're lying.

666
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,100
My friends will come for me.

667
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,300
Hoping against hope.

668
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:56,500
Such an endearing human trait.
l'm touched. Really.

669
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,000
One last chance, Sonya.

670
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,100
Fight me in Mortal Kombat.

671
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,900
Go to hell.

672
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,300
Take her away.

673
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,600
The Emperor will be overjoyed.

674
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,300
My friends will come.

675
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,900
They're already here.

676
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,600
- Seize them.
- Stay where you are.

677
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,900
Will you dare interfere
with the tournament...

678
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,500
and betray our Emperor?

679
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,000
ln his great wisdom, he knows
that Mortal Kombat...

680
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,100
cannot be won by treachery.

681
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,500
How dare you speak to me
of treachery?

682
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:46,500
Your ignorance will lose forever...

683
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,900
the keys to the Realm of Earth.

684
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,500
very well.

685
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
l challenge you.

686
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,600
You'll fight me.

687
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,600
l am Liu Kang...

688
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,100
descendant of Kung Lao.

689
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,000
l challenge you to Mortal Kombat.

690
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,900
Do you accept or yield?

691

l accept.

692
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,800
Leave us.

693
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,800
l will take care..

694
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,800
of this impudent mortal myself.

695
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,500
Nice dress.

696
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,500
You fool.

697
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,100
What's that noise?

698
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:14,200
The source of all
Shang Tsung's power.

699
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,300
The souls of 1[ dead warriors.

700
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,500
Face your enemy.

701
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,000
ls that all you've got, sorcerer?

702
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,100
Liu Kang!

703
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,100
l can see into your soul.

704
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,800
You will die.

705
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:09,400
Face yourself.

706
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:13,000
You can look into my soul...

707
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,900
but you don't own it.

708
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,700
Face your worst fear.

709
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,100
l'm not afraid of my destiny.

710
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,600
Face me.

711
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,500
Liu.

712
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,200
Chan?

713
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,600
lt can't be you.

714
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,900
Rayden sent me.

715
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,200
To help you.

716
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,100
You're not really Chan.

717
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,900
Remember when our parents died?

718
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,700
You promised you'd always
take care of me?

719
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,600
l remember.

720
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,600
lt's my turn to take care of you.

721
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,600
Come with me.

722
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,200
l forgive you for letting me die.

723
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,200
lt wasn't my fault.

724
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,200
- Brother.
- No.

725
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,800
Chan chose his own path.

726
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:49,000
Every man is responsible
for his own destiny.

727
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,400
Shang Tsung killed my brother.

728
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,600
You're mine.

729
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,700
The Chosen One.

730
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,600
l am The Chosen One.

731
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,800
You hear your slaves, sorcerer?

732
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:04,500
You have lost your power over them.
They have risen up against you.

733
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,800
Free them.

734
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,500
They are mine forever.

735
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,600
All those souls,
and you don't have your own.

736
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,400
l pity you, sorcerer.

737
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,300
Save your pity for the weak.

738
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:39,400
Surrender!

739
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,900
Never!

740
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,400
Flawless victory.

741
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,700
l knew you'd come.

742
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,100
Chan.

743
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,000
One day...

744
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,000
we will be reunited...

745
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,700
but until then my spirit
will always be with you.

746
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,100
Go in peace, my brother.

747
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,600
Let's go home..

748
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,600
l've been waiting for you.

749
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,900
What took you so long?

750
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,700
l guess you knew it would
end this way.

751
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,800
Didn't have a clue.

752
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:02,000
You humans are so unpredictable.

753
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:07,300
l must tell you something...
you guys did great.

754
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,300
- Bow to me!
- What is it?

755
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,400
The Emperor.

756
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:26,100
You weak, pathetic fools.
l've come for your souls.

757
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,500
l don't think so.
