2
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,900
Oh, Seth. Hey, Seth.

3
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:48,704
Heard the news, Seth?

4
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:51,000
General Grant's called on Lee
to surrender.

5
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,005
'T ain't official yet.

6
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,030
By Jingos Amos, if that news is true,

7
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:56,315
there won't be a sober man in town
tonight.

8
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,710
It's our patriotic duty to celebrate.

9
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:01,119
My sakes, what a purty house.

10
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:04,701
Ayeh, t'aint everyone gets to see
the Mannon place close to.

11
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,945
Anyone at home?
No.

12
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,518
No. Mrs Mannon is in New York.

13
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,512
Miss Lavinia is a'visiting with
Hazel and Peter Niles.

14
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,785
I think you must be wrong
about Miss Vinnie.

15
00:03:13,798 --> 00:03:16,728
Peter Niles and his sister've been
away somewheres.

16
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,030
Just got back.

17
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,172
Yeah, we just seen them get off
the train.

18
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:22,074
Lavinia wan't with 'em?

19
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:23,098
No.

20
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:26,405
Maybe she's off gallivantin' with that
Captain Brant.

21
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,259
That's his ship down the harbor.

22
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:30,933
The pretty clipper. The Flying Trades.

23
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,502
Folks say he's been calling here.

24
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:34,802
Haunting someone.

25
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:37,983
Folks say more than their prayers.

26
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:40,618
My, I've never seen such a purty house.

27
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:41,885
Cost him money.

28
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:44,193
I can remember when old late Mannon,

29
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:46,142
he's been dead these twenty years,

30
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:49,554
tore down the old Mannon house
and built this place.

31
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,400
My, they must be rich.

32
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:55,805
Ayeh. Mannon's been top dog around here
for nigh on to 200 years.

33
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:58,186
And don't let folks forget it neither.

34
00:03:58,293 --> 00:04:00,043
What's it like inside?

35
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:03,301
We never seen the inside,
me and Louisa.

36
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:05,367
Not many folks in town has.

37
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:08,600
Couldn't you give us just a peek,
Mr Beckwith?

38
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:11,300
No. The Mannons are strict
about trespassing.

39
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,568
There's a gallon of liquor in it for you.

40
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:17,404
Well,

41
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:20,774
if you promise not to say nothing
to nobody about it.

42
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,170
This is Ezra Mannon's study.

43
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:32,767
Ezra's the general, ain't he?

44
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,771
Yep, the best darn fighter
in the whole of Grant's army.

45
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,562
That's him up there.

46
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:41,000
He looks like a judge.
He was a judge.

47
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:42,844
How did he come to join the army?

48
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:44,411
He was a soldier when he was young.

49
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,955
In the Mexican War.
Come out a Major.

50
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,345
His Pa, Abe Mannon, died that year

51
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:52,639
Ezra quit the army and took a hold
of the Mannon shipping business,

52
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:56,576
learned Law on the side and
got made a judge.

53
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,521
He was Mayor of the town when
this war broke out.

54
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:04,081
Ayeh. But he resigned to once
and joined the army again.

55
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:06,308
And now he's riz to be General.

56
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:09,256
Oh, he's able, Ezra is.

57
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:12,123
Yeah, this town is real proud of Ezra.

58
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:14,500
Which is more than we can say
for his wife.

59
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,350
We ain't talking about her.

60
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,813
I'll see if I can find the key
to the second room.

61
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,900
Don't rile him, Louisa.

62
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:27,442
Oh, he's so proud
of these durned ol' Mannons.

63
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:29,900
I couldn't help giving him a dig
about Ezra's wife.

64
00:05:29,906 --> 00:05:33,616
He's starting to act like the Mannons,
high and mighty.

65
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:36,358
Looks lke him too,
from being with 'em all his life.

66
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:39,352
Everyone in town knows that Mannon look.

67
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,137
Ayeh, they even growed it on their wives.

68
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,700
Like a mask they put on.

69
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,609
They don't want folks to guess
their secrets.

70
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:47,613
Secrets?

71
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,931
Oh, the Mannons have skeletons
in their closets same as others.

72
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,500
Only worse ones.

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
When I was a young one

74
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:57,985
the whole town was talking about
the scandal

75
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,131
David Mannon made with that
French nurse girl

76
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,709
who worked for Ezra's Pa.

77
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,559
He finally had to marry her.

78
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:07,354
And Abe Mannon kicked him out.

79
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,566
It was after that that Abe
built this house.

80
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:14,226
He built it out of pure hate.

81
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:17,173
Hate for his own flesh and blood...
Shhh.

82
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:25,900
My, ain't it purty?

83
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:29,007
How'd they make their money?
Shipping.

84
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:33,300
His ships was flying the Mannon flag
way back in colonial times.

85
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:35,913
Now, his Pa here...

86
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:39,900
His Pa was quite a power in his days.

87
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,339
Preached the Gospel in Salem
where they burned the witches.

88
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:46,240
I heard tell there weren't no one knowed more

89
00:06:46,296 --> 00:06:49,306
about hell, fire and damnation
than he did.

90
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:52,006
Here's...

91
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:55,627
here's Abe Mannon.
That's Ezra's Pa.

92
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:57,325
He built this house.

93
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:01,121
He started one of the world's first
Western ocean packet lines.

94
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,489
Made a pile of money.

95
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:03,891
Who's he?

96
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:06,713
That's Abe's Pa.

97
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,519
Ezra'a grandpa.

98
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:12,717
He was an officer in General Washington's
army.

99
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:16,045
Seth, ain't there one of the Mannons
missing?

100
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,940
Abe had a brother, didn't he?

101
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:21,008
Yes, David Mannon.

102
00:07:21,015 --> 00:07:23,265
Where's he?
He went West.

103
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:25,361
Died out there, you see?

104
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,307
I'll show you out now.

105
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:32,133
Oh, look, Minnie.
There's a picture of Ezra's wife.

106
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:33,275
That's Abe's wife.

107
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:35,343
Oh, no, I mean this one.

108
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:39,673
My, she's awful handsome, ain't she?

109
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:42,426
Mmm, too foreign looking
for my taste.

110
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,800
That's their children, Lavinia and Orin.

111
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:50,208
Must have been took before he went off
to join his father at the front.

112
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:52,075
See here, now.
I got to get back to work.

113
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:54,845
Here's Peter Niles and his sister Hazel.

114
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:56,965
My, she's pretty, ain't she?

115
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,900
I guess Orin thinks so.

116
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:01,335
But Peter, he's in love with Miss Vinnie.

117
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,300
Ain't they engaged, Seth?

118
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:08,457
Or has he got a rival in that Captain Brant
who's been calling here?

119
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,465
I'll show you out now.

120
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:27,564
Darned old gossip monger.

121
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:30,231
All that cheap gab about David.

122
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,350
I'll bet news about the war being over
is true.

123
00:08:34,377 --> 00:08:39,067
Ezra better get back here.
There's something queer going on.

124
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,800
Folks are gossiping about
that Captain Grant calling here.

125
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:45,653
That's his ship down in the harbor.

126
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:47,400
But he ain't on board.

127
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,567
They say he lives in New York.

128
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:52,000
But where's Vinnie?

129
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:57,331
She told her Ma that she went to visit
Hazel and Peter Niles, but she lied.

130
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:59,665
T'aint like Vinnie to lie.

131
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:27,575
Next time you come to New York
you'll bring Lavinia, won't you?

132
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,370
Yes, Papa.
Au revoir, Papa.

133
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:22,845
Lots of excitement in town tonight, Ma'am.

134
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:25,136
Folks are celebrating the victory.

135
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:28,733
They'd do better to wait.
The news isn't confirmed yet.

136
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,915
You didn't tell me Lavinia was home.

137
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,471
I didn't see her come in.

138
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:26,481
Vinnie.

139
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,721
Vinnie.

140
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:42,808
Vinnie. Answer me, please.

141
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,333
Is anything wrong?

142
00:13:44,343 --> 00:13:45,800
I have a headache.

143
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:47,365
I'm in bed.

144
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:23,853
Good afternoon, Mrs Mannon.

145
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,238
Why, Peter.

146
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:26,845
Hazel, how are you, my dear?

147
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,036
Hello, Mrs Mannon.

148
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:30,544
Peter, haven't you seen enough
of Lavinia?

149
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:31,900
I haven't seen her in ages.

150
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:34,617
Look at him. He's getting jealous
afraid he's got a rival.

151
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,535
She isn't sick, is she?

152
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:37,563
Just a headache.

153
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,500
I think you're what she needs.
Someone to make a fuss over her.

154
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:41,721
What did I tell you?

155
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:43,207
You'll find her in the house.

156
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,530
Run along, little boy.
You know you're dying to see her.

157
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,221
Of course I am. Excuse me.

158
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:50,772
Any more news from Orin?

159
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:52,914
Not since the letter I showed you,
my dear.

160
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,805
You don't think he's been wounded,
do you, Mrs Mannon?

161
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:58,024
Of course not. He's with his father.
We'd have heard right away.

162
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:01,184
Oh, there, there, my dear.

163
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:04,494
Vinnie.

164
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:06,401
I've been looking all over for you.

165
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,752
How are you, Peter?
Fine. My wound's all heeled...

166
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:11,238
and I've got orders to leave tomorrow.
They'll be cancelled now, I guess.

167
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,037
Has the news been confirmed yet?
Not yet.

168
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,175
You'll hear the fort firing and the salute
when it's official.

169
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,731
I won't pretend I'm the sort of hero
who wants to go back.

170
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,949
I've had enough.

171
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,700
I guess you'll be glad, too.

172
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:24,326
To get Orin and your father
home again.

173
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,600
Oh, yes, Father.

174
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,202
Oh, I do hope he comes home soon.

175
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:35,352
You love him, don't you?

176
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:37,482
Vinnie, I...

177
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:41,000
I came here to ask you something.

178
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:44,463
You told me once to wait
till the war was over.

179
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,912
Well, it looks like the war
is about over now.

180
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,400
I can't marry anyone, Peter.

181
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,950
Father will need me.

182
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:02,804
He's got your mother.
He needs me more.

183
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:06,136
I'm sorry, Peter.

184
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,311
I can't explain...

185
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:10,600
You know how much I do
care for you.

186
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,360
Why, you and Hazel and Orin and I
we grew up together.

187
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:14,952
Don't change that, Peter.

188
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:20,236
Of course I won't, Vinnie.

189
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,052
You'll change your mind.

190
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,322
Unless you love someone else.

191
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,268
How about this mysterious clipper Captain
who's been calling on you?

192
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:29,472
Do you think I care anything
about that...

193
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,016
I only meant folks say he's courting
you and...

194
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,359
I hate the sight of him.
I was afraid that...

195
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,366
Well, never mind, I...

196
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,522
Who is he, anyway?

197
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:45,946
Well, I... don't know very
much about him, really.

198
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:48,736
Mother met him at Grandfather's
in New York.

199
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:53,029
He did tell a lot of stories.
I didn't pay attention.

200
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,091
He went to sea as a boy

201
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,366
and he was in California for the Gold Rush.

202
00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:59,242
He sailed all over the world.

203
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,412
He lived on a South Sea island once.

204
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:04,805
So he says.

205
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:07,903
Sounds romantic.

206
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:09,632
That's his trade.

207
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,290
Being romantic.

208
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,210
Peter...

209
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,913
Did you say anything to Mother
about me?

210
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,929
What didn't he tell me, Vinnie?

211
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,247
He only told me he hadn't seen
you for ages, my dear.

212
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,710
Vinnie's not herself today, Peter.

213
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,571
But don't take it too hard.

214
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:34,700
It's me she's angry at, not you.

215
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:38,677
Well, I guess I'd better run along.

216
00:17:38,699 --> 00:17:39,820
Come back tomorrow.

217
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:41,738
She'll be running to you
if you don't.

218
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,000
Goodbye, Vinnie.

219
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:45,870
Goodbye, Peter.

220
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,181
Goodbye, Mrs Mannon.

221
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:49,290
Goodbye, Peter.

222
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:58,243
Now I know why you've been
avoiding me all day.

223
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:00,744
A guilty conscience.

224
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,030
You don't deny you lied to me about
visiting Hazel, do you?

225
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:05,626
No.

226
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:08,601
Well, I have no doubts
you'll tell me where you were.

227
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:11,116
I intend to.

228
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,900
How was Grandfather Hamil?

229
00:18:15,242 --> 00:18:16,600
Much better now.

230
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,827
He seems to have been sick so much
this past year.

231
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:23,135
He'll soon be doing the rounds
with his patients again.

232
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,310
He sends you his love.

233
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:25,707
Oh, by the way.

234
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,654
I happened to meet
Captain Brant on the street in New York.

235
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,320
He said he was coming up here today

236
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:33,727
to take over his ship and asked
if he might drop in to see you.

237
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,105
Doesn't that please you, Vinnie?

238
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,107
Is that why you picked the flowers?

239
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,982
Because Captain Brant is coming.

240
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,462
Haven't you heard the news?

241
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:45,828
It means that Father will be coming
home soon.

242
00:18:46,262 --> 00:18:50,000
I haven't heard the fort
firing any canons.

243
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:51,017
You will.

244
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm sure I hope so as much as you.

245
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,400
You can't say that.

246
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,107
You will not take that tone with me,
please.

247
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,702
I've got to have a talk with you,
Mother. Before long.

248
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,157
Whenever you wish.

249
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:04,666
You always make such a mystery
of things, Vinnie.

250
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:26,872
What are you driving at, Seth?

251
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:30,145
Ain't you noticed this fellow Brant
reminds you of someone?

252
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:33,706
Your Pa, ain't it, Vinnie?
Father?

253
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,453
Yes, he does.

254
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,614
That must be why I felt...
Yeah.

255
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:40,147
He's like Orin, too.

256
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:42,334
He's like all the Mannons I've
ever knowed.

257
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:46,354
And more specially he calls to mind
your grandpa's brother, David.

258
00:19:46,388 --> 00:19:49,088
Oh, I know his name ain't never been
allowed to be spoken

259
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,100
among the Mannons since the day
he left,

260
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,468
but you've likely listened to gossip,
ain't ya?

261
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:58,458
There was a nurse girl working
in the house.

262
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,332
David had to marry her.

263
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,519
She was going to have a baby.

264
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:05,000
And your grandpa threw 'em both out.

265
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:08,241
Tore the house down and built
this one.

266
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,900
What's that whole scandal got to do
with Captain Brant?

267
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,827
Ain't it funny that no one ever heard
tell of David or his wife after they left?

268
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:20,621
Your Grandpa had it out with me one time
that she'd had the baby.

269
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:22,442
It was a boy.

270
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,736
He was cussing it.

271
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:28,662
Now it's about her baby
I've been thinking.

272
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:31,800
No, I can't believe it, no...
No, hear, here's another funny thing.

273
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:33,571
His name, Brant.

274
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,600
Sounds made up to me.

275
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,033
Sounds like it was a short for
something else.

276
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:42,533
Remember what that nurse gal's
name was?

277
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,650
T'was Marie Brantôme.
Brantôme...

278
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:48,146
Oh, don't be stupid, Seth.

279
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:50,337
His name would be Mannon
and he'd be more than proud of it.

280
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:52,800
He'd have good reasons not to use
the name Mannon

281
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:54,474
when he come calling here,
wouldn't he?

282
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:57,309
That would be too horrible, I...
All I'm driving at, Vinnie...

283
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,976
is that you ought for your Pa's sake
to make certain.
How?

284
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,949
Catch him off guard.
Give it to him good and strong.

285
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:06,174
See if he don't give himself away,
maybe.

286
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:09,771
Looks like him coming up the drive now.

287
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:13,445
There's something about his walk
that brings back David Mannon, too.

288
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,890
If I didn't know it was him

289
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,411
I'd think it was David's ghost
coming home.

290
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:23,611
Use your head, Vinnie, now...

291
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:34,700
Captain Brant.
Oh.

292
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:36,309
Good afternoon.

293
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:39,359
Hope you don't mind my walking in on
you without ceremony.

294
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:41,660
Your mother told me...
She had to go out for a while.

295
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:42,700
I'm in luck then.

296
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,233
I haven't had a chance to be alone
with you, Lavinia

297
00:21:44,244 --> 00:21:47,202
since that night we went walking
in the moonlight, do you remember?

298
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,975
What do you think of the news
of Lee's surrendering, Captain?

299
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:55,177
You're very formal today, Lavinia.

300
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,550
We expect my father home
very soon now.

301
00:21:57,556 --> 00:21:59,177
Won't you sit down?

302
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:01,988
Thank you.

303
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:08,436
Yes, you must be very happy
at the thought
of seeing your father again.

304
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:12,234
I love Father better than anyone
in the world.

305
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,850
I suppose that's the usual way of it...

306
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,470
the daughter feels closer to her father
and a son to his mother.

307
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:20,374
I should think you'd be
a born exception to the rule.

308
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:21,393
Why?

309
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,600
You're so like your mother
in some ways.

310
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:27,474
Both of you call to mind
someone who is very dear to me.

311
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:29,627
You'll think it's strange
when I tell you.

312
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,700
It was my mother.

313
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:33,227
I'm not a bit like Mother.

314
00:22:33,234 --> 00:22:34,950
Everyone knows I take after Father.

315
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,436
You're very puzzling today,
Miss Lavinia.

316
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,931
You'll excuse me if I come out
with it bluntly

317
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:43,708
but what are you holding against me?

318
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:47,157
Maybe I'm only flattering myself,
but I thought you liked me.

319
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,629
Have you forgotten that night
walking along the shore?

320
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:54,100
Did Mother tell you you could kiss me?

321
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,029
Come now, you don't really mean
I should have asked her, do you?

322
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,174
I wasn't brought up that strictly.

323
00:23:01,185 --> 00:23:05,665
Anyway, I didn't.
And it wasn't less sweet for that.

324
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:12,380
I'm afraid I gabbed too much
that night talking about ships.

325
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,154
But you certainly seemed interested
when I told you

326
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,866
about those islands in the South Seas
where I was shipwrecked.

327
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:21,068
I remember your admiration for
the native women.

328
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,500
You said the'd found the secret of happiness
because they'd never heard...

329
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:28,000
that love can be sin.

330
00:23:28,016 --> 00:23:31,526
Ay, they live in as near the god
in a paradise before sin was discovered

331
00:23:31,563 --> 00:23:33,403
as you'll find on this earth.

332
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:35,383
The blessed isles...

333
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,147
where one can forget all Man's
dirty dreams of greed and power...

334
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:41,227
and dirty dreams of love.

335
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:48,161
Whenever I remember those islands now
I'll always think of you, Lavinia.

336
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:50,425
As you walked beside me that night

337
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,550
with the moonlight in your eyes...

338
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,567
Don't touch me, you liar, you...
Lavinia!

339
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:55,573
Quit lying.

340
00:23:55,629 --> 00:23:58,429
What else should I expect
from the son of a common nurse girl?

341
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
Belay that!

342
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:01,993
No Mannon can insult her
while I'm alive!

343
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,300
So it's true. You are her son.

344
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,000
And what if I am? My only shame
is my dirty Mannon blood.

345
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:10,131
You're too good for the son
of a servant, eh?

346
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,900
By heavens, you were glad enough
that night.

347
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,809
I was only leading you on
to find out things.

348
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
Oh, no you weren't.

349
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,270
I know how your father stuffed you
with these lies about my mother.

350
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,901
Do you want to know the truth?

351
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:21,477
So you're a coward, are you?
Like all the Mannons...

352
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:23,379
when it comes to facing the truth
about themselves.

353
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:25,367
I bet he never told you that your
grandfather, Abe Mannon,

354
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:26,870
loved my mother.
That's a lie.

355
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:28,673
It was his jealous revenge that made him
disown my father

356
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:30,073
and cheat him out of his right
to a share of the business.

357
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,563
He didn't cheat him,
he bought him out.

358
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:33,256
Forced him to sell for next to nothing,
you mean.

359
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:35,922
My father was a coward
like all the Mannons.

360
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:37,339
He took to drink.

361
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,719
One night night he came home crazy drunk
and hit my mother in the face.

362
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:42,782
It made me blind mad and I struck him
with a poker and cut his head.

363
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:45,633
I told you I don't want to hear.
For days afterwards
he sat and stared at nothing.

364
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,562
One night he went out and
didn't come back.

365
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:50,141
Next morning they found him hanging
in a barn.

366
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,300
It was the only decent thing
he ever did.

367
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,743
My mother blamed me for it
and I ran away to sea.

368
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:58,190
Forgot I had a mother,
except that I took part of her name.

369
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:00,031
I wouldn't wear the name of Mannon.

370
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,440
When I came back to New York
I found her dying

371
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:03,960
of sickness and starvation.

372
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:08,010
She'd sunk her last shred of pride
and written to your father for a loan.

373
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:10,100
He never even answered.

374
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:13,380
He could have saved her
and he let her die.

375
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,260
He's as guilty of murder as anyone
he ever sent
to the rope when he was a judge.

376
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:18,768
You dare say that about Father.
If he were here he'd...

377
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,575
I'd tell him what I tell you now.

378
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,124
That I swore on my mother's body
to revenge her death on him.

379
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:25,340
I suppose you boast you've done it now

380
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:28,634
in the vilest, most cowardly way
like a son of a servant you are.

381
00:25:28,648 --> 00:25:30,400
Belay, I told you, with that kind of talk.

382
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,300
So my mother is your only means of
revenge on Father, is that it?

383
00:25:33,313 --> 00:25:35,413
I... I don't know what you mean of it.

384
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:37,900
You soon will.
And so will she.

385
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:40,368
Lavinia.

386
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:42,115
You wait here until I call you.

387
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:52,800
Really, this unconfirmed report
must have turned your head.

388
00:25:52,808 --> 00:25:55,200
Sending Annie
to say I must see you immediately.

389
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,790
Did she tell you I was resting?

390
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:57,991
You better sit down, Mother.

391
00:25:58,021 --> 00:25:59,600
More mystery?

392
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:04,285
Perhaps you'd better begin by telling me
where you were while I was away.

393
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:06,800
You've admitted you lied.

394
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:09,727
Yes.
Where were you.

395
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:11,500
In New York.

396
00:26:11,508 --> 00:26:13,980
I followed you.
I saw you meet Brant.

397
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:18,700
Well, I told you I ran into him
by accident.

398
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:20,039
You went to his room.

399
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:23,059
He asked me to meet a friend of his.

400
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:25,500
A lady.
I saw you with him alone.

401
00:26:25,504 --> 00:26:28,020
He said he had to talk to me
about you.

402
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,500
He wanted my help to approach
your father.

403
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:33,800
How can you lie like that?

404
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:37,101
How can you be so depraved as to try
to use me hide your vile guilt?

405
00:26:37,116 --> 00:26:38,616
Vinnie!
Stop lying.

406
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:40,080
I saw you in his arms.

407
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:42,420
You're evil and shameless.

408
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:44,417
Even if you are my mother, I say t.

409
00:26:46,325 --> 00:26:50,665
I knew you hated me, Vinnie,
but not so bitterly as that.

410
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:54,821
Very well, I love Adam Brant.

411
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:58,011
Oh, how you say that.

412
00:26:58,022 --> 00:27:00,282
Without any shame.

413
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:03,400
How can you do this to Father?

414
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:06,105
You would understand
if you were the wife of a man you hated.

415
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:08,079
Stop talking like that before him.
I won't listen.

416
00:27:08,097 --> 00:27:09,160
You will listen.

417
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:13,224
I'm talking to you as a woman now.
Not as a mother to daughter.

418
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:16,100
That relationship has no meaning
between us now.

419
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:19,690
You've called me vile and shameless.

420
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,680
Well, I want you to know
that's what I felt about myself

421
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:25,401
for over 20 years
every time I was in his arms.

422
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,015
Stop telling me such things.

423
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:29,291
I loved him once before I married him.

424
00:27:29,301 --> 00:27:32,900
But marriage soon turned my love
into disgust.

425
00:27:34,702 --> 00:27:37,700
So I was born of your disgust.

426
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:39,900
I always guessed that, Mother.

427
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,110
Ever since I was little, when I'd run
to you with love

428
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:43,354
and you'd always push me away.

429
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:47,173
I hate you. It's only right that
I should hate you.

430
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:50,660
Oh, I tried to love you.

431
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,620
I told myself it wasn't human
not to love my own child,
born of my body

432
00:27:55,637 --> 00:28:00,117
but I never could make myself feel
you were born of anybody but his.

433
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:03,500
You were always my wedding night
to me...

434
00:28:03,508 --> 00:28:05,418
in my honeymoon.

435
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:07,400
You loved Orin.

436
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:09,055
Why didn't you hate him, too.

437
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:13,600
Because by then I had forced myself
to become resigned

438
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:15,313
in order to live.

439
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,510
And while I was carrying him
your father was with the army in Mexico.

440
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,985
I could forget him.

441
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:23,215
When Orin was born...

442
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:26,444
he seemed to be my own child.
Only mine.

443
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:27,858
And I loved him for that.

444
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:30,969
I loved him until he let you and your
father nag him into this war.

445
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:33,569
It was his duty as a Mannon to go.

446
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:37,132
Well, I hope you realize I never would
have fallen in love with Adam

447
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,990
if I'd had Orin with me.

448
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,160
When he'd gone,
there was nothing left but hate

449
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,100
and a desire to be revenged.

450
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:47,350
And a longing for love.

451
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:50,370
Then I met Adam. I saw he loved me...

452
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,700
He doesn't love you.
You're only his revenge on Father.

453
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,108
Do you know who he really is?

454
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,530
He's the son of that common nurse girl
Grandfather put out of our house.

455
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:01,660
So you found that out?

456
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,357
Were you hoping it would be a crushing
surprise to me?

457
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:08,044
I've known it all along.

458
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:11,815
I suppose that gave you all the more satisfaction
to add that disgrace.

459
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:16,300
Will you kindly come to the point
and tell me what you intend doing?

460
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,330
I suppose you'll hardly let your father
get in the door before you tell him.

461
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,600
Not unless you force me to.

462
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:24,821
You know Father would disown you publicly

463
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,833
no matter what the scandal cost him.

464
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:28,739
Oh, I'd like to see you punished.

465
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:31,613
So please understand this isn't
for your sake. It's for Father's.

466
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:33,711
He hasn't been well
and I'm not going to have him hurt.

467
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:37,345
I know better than to expect any
generosity on my account.

468
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:38,556
Come to the point.

469
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,834
I won't tell him provided you give up Brant
and never see him again.

470
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:53,300
What a fraud you are, Vinnie.

471
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:57,069
I'm not denying you want to save
your father's pride.

472
00:29:57,084 --> 00:30:00,090
And I know how anxious you are
to keep the family from more scandal.

473
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,350
But that's not your real reason
for sparing me.

474
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:04,373
It is.

475
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,800
You love Adam Brant.
You wanted him for yourself.

476
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,823
That's a lie.

477
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,803
Now you know you can't have him,
you're determined to take him from me.

478
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:10,901
Don't be ridiculous.

479
00:30:10,923 --> 00:30:13,883
Because of your father,
I'd have to go away with Adam...

480
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:15,200
He'd still be mine

481
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:18,834
You can't bear that thought
even at the price of my disgrace.

482
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:19,861
Stop it.

483
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:22,150
Oh, I've watched you ever since
you were little,

484
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:24,530
trying to do exactly what you're trying
to do now.

485
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:27,999
You've always schemed to steal
my place with your father and Orin.

486
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,413
It's you who stole all love from me
from the time I was born.

487
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:33,991
Are you going to do what I told you
or not?

488
00:30:34,554 --> 00:30:36,924
What if I refuse?

489
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,214
Suppose I go off openly with Adam?

490
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:43,625
Where will you and your father
and the family be after that scandal?

491
00:30:43,656 --> 00:30:46,256
You'd be disgraced more.
I'd have the man I love.

492
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:47,273
Not for long.

493
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:49,453
Father would get your lover blacklisted

494
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:51,251
and he'd lose his ship and never get another.

495
00:30:51,273 --> 00:30:53,743
And Father won't divorce you, never.

496
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:57,154
You'd be an anchor around Brant's neck.
He'd grow to hate the sight of you.

497
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,463
Don't forget your age.

498
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:01,029
He'll still be in his prime
when you're an old ugly woman.

499
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:04,600
You devil, you mean...
I wouldn't call names if I were you.

500
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:10,500
I'm a fool to let you make me lose
my temper.

501
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:15,443
But you want my answer,
don't you?

502
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:19,400
Well, I agree to do as you say.

503
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:21,500
You promise not to see Brant again?

504
00:31:22,318 --> 00:31:25,001
Yes.
You'll have to tell him yourself
you're through with him.

505
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:27,894
Yes, when he comes.
He's waiting outside.

506
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:31,521
Shall I call him in?

507
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:36,191
You seem to take giving him up
pretty easily.

508
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:39,171
You think I'll ever give you the satisfaction
of seeing me grieve?

509
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:42,301
Oh, no, Vinnie.
You'll never have a chance to gloat.

510
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:47,712
I know you're thinking already how
you can fool me and break your promise.

511
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:49,465
But you'd better not try it.

512
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:52,178
I'll be watching you every minute
and I won't be the only one.

513
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:54,172
I wrote to Father and Orin.

514
00:31:54,198 --> 00:31:57,318
About Adam?
Only enough so they'll be suspicious
and watch you.

515
00:31:58,426 --> 00:32:01,400
I see what it's going to mean.

516
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:04,346
That you'll have me under your thumb
the rest of my life.

517
00:32:04,393 --> 00:32:07,463
Take care, Vinnie. You'll be responsible if...
If what?

518
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:09,700
Nothing.

519
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:12,832
I only meant if I went off with Adam.

520
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:15,104
But of course you know I can't do that.

521
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:19,143
There is nothing I can do now
but obey your orders.

522
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:21,715
You ought to see it's your duty
to Father,

523
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:23,106
and not my orders.

524
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:25,358
Now call him in and
tell him what you've got to do.

525
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:31,722
Give me a chance to get out
the back way.

526
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:34,028
And I want him out of this house
before I get back.

527
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:37,100
If he's not, I'll write Father again.

528
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:23,703
Adam.

529
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:28,000
She knows?

530
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:30,111
Yes. Close the doors.

531
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,758
Don't be frightened, Christine.

532
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:41,412
Shenandoah, I long to hear you

533
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:46,239
Way-ay you rollin' river

534
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,177
Well, did you put it strong to him
like I told you?

535
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,862
I made a fool of myself.

536
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:10,517
There's no connection,
do you understand?

537
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,727
It was just some crazy idea
of yours.

538
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:15,503
All right, Vinnie.
If you want it left that way,

539
00:34:15,598 --> 00:34:17,338
I'll leave it that way.

540
00:34:17,352 --> 00:34:19,402
You sound as if you didn't
believe me.

541
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:21,102
Sure, sure I believe you.

542
00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:23,000
I believe in anything you tell me
to believe.

543
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:26,288
I ain't been with the Mannons 60 years
without learning that.

544
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:31,397
Seth...
Ayeh?

545
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,500
What was that Marie Brantôme like?

546
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:36,214
Oh, she was always laughing
and singing.

547
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:38,176
Frisky and full of life.

548
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:40,469
Talked foreign like your Ma, too.

549
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:43,847
There was somthing wild and free
about her.

550
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:46,512
Everyone took to Marie.

551
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:48,029
Even your Paw.

552
00:34:50,049 --> 00:34:51,200
Father, too?

553
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:52,216
Ayeh.

554
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:55,142
He was a boy at the time,
just feeling his oats.

555
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:56,662
But he was wild about her.

556
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:58,600
That's why he hated her worse
than anyone

557
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,440
when it got found out
that she and his uncle David was...

558
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:03,877
mixed up together.

559
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:07,834
I don't believe that about Father.

560
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:09,640
You've had too much whiskey.

561
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:22,518
We've got to decide what to do.

562
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:26,669
The time for skulking and lying is over
and, by heavens, I'm glad of it.

563
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:29,247
It's a coward's game
and I've no stomach for it.

564
00:35:30,257 --> 00:35:33,867
I simply couldn't believe he would
ever come home again.

565
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:37,800
I prayed for him to be killed
in the war.

566
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:41,117
Oh, if he were only dead.

567
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,000
That chance is finished now.

568
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:45,149
Yes, in that way.

569
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:49,559
What made you sit there?
It's his chair.

570
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:53,700
Oh, it's just silly talk about resemblances.

571
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:57,055
When he comes home
I'll not give Vinnie the satisfaction
of telling him.

572
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:58,986
I'll tell him myself.

573
00:35:59,094 --> 00:36:01,114
I'd give my soul to see his face

574
00:36:01,123 --> 00:36:03,800
when he finds out that you love
Marie Brantôme's son.

575
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:06,977
Then I'll take you away openly
and we'll laugh at him.

576
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:09,184
If he tries to stop me...
What would you do?

577
00:36:10,523 --> 00:36:13,223
If I ever laid my hands on him
I'd kill him.

578
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,111
And be hanged for murder?

579
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,913
If I insult him in the street
he'll have to fight.

580
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,227
Do you imagine
you could force him to fight a duel?

581
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,700
He'd simply feel bound to do his duty
as a former judge

582
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,288
and have you arrested.

583
00:36:26,298 --> 00:36:29,400
It would be a poor revenge
for your mother's death

584
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:31,580
to let him make you a laughing stock.

585
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,810
If I take you off on my ship
the laugh will be on him.

586
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:36,900
Don't you realize
he would never divorce me?

587
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:39,770
What would I be
in the eyes of the world?

588
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,940
My life would be ruined and
I'd ruin yours.

589
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,619
You'd grow to hate me.

590
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:48,425
Don't talk like that, Christine.

591
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,333
I'll grow old so soon. I'm afraid of time.

592
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:54,866
So my my sailing on your ship
you'll find you won't have a ship.

593
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:56,776
He'll get you blacklisted.

594
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:00,547
If he had only been killed.

595
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:02,800
We could be married now.

596
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:06,000
And I would bring you my share
of the Mannon fortune.

597
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:07,771
It's only justice.

598
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:10,200
It's what his father stole from yours.

599
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:13,356
You could buy your own ship

600
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,230
and be your own master then.

601
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,550
That's always been my dream.

602
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:19,814
You've been on board
the Flying Trades, Christine.

603
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,030
She's as beautiful a ship
as you are a woman.

604
00:37:22,046 --> 00:37:25,291
If she was mine I'd take you
on a honeymoon to China.

605
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:29,130
And on the voyage back
we'd stop at the blessed isles
I told you about.

606
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:32,688
There's the right place for love
and a honeymoon.

607
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:36,641
Yes, but Ezra is alive.

608
00:37:39,163 --> 00:37:41,123
I know. It's only a dream.

609
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:43,753
You remember my telling you

610
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:46,987
he had written complaining of pains
about his heart.

611
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:50,152
I went to see Dr. Blake,
our family doctor,

612
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,900
and showed him Ezra's letter.

613
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,000
He's the town's worst gossip.

614
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm sure everybone knows
about Ezra's weak heart by this time.

615
00:37:57,406 --> 00:37:59,000
What are you driving at, Christine?

616
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:01,470
If he died suddenly now...

617
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,511
no one would think
it was anything but heart failure.

618
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:08,032
I was reading a book in Father's
medical library

619
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:11,666
It was as if some fate in me
forced me to see it.

620
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:14,278
I've written it here.

621
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,524
You sail for Boston tomorrow,
don't you?

622
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:19,624
Get this the minute you reach there.

623
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:22,700
You can make up a story
about some sick dog on your ship.

624
00:38:22,907 --> 00:38:25,432
As soon as you get it
bring it to me here.

625
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:28,600
You can't do a thing like that, Christine.
You'll be suspected.

626
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:31,715
He's taking medicine.
I'll give him his medicine.

627
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:33,220
I'll blend it carefully.

628
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,310
But if he dies suddenly, won't Vinnie...

629
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,366
She's worried already about his heart.

630
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:39,400
What about Orin?
He'll be coming back, too.

631
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,667
Orin will believe anything
I want him to.

632
00:38:41,673 --> 00:38:42,673
Poison.

633
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:45,810
It's a coward's trick.

634
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,990
You think you'd be braver
to give me up to him

635
00:38:47,998 --> 00:38:49,755
and let him take away your ship?

636
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,916
Didn't you say you wanted
to kill him?

637
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:53,300
But I'd give him his chance.

638
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,700
Did he give your mother her chance?

639
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:58,322
What makes you suddenly so scrupulous
about his death?

640
00:38:58,332 --> 00:39:00,422
It must be the Mannon in you
coming out.

641
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:03,934
Are you going to prove
the first time
your love is put to a test

642
00:39:03,954 --> 00:39:06,244
that you are a weak coward
like your father?

643
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:08,405
Christine, if it was any man who
said that to me I...

644
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:10,200
Have you ever thought of this?

645
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:12,355
That he's coming back to my bed.

646
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:16,265
Perhaps your love is only a lie
you told me

647
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:18,590
to take a cheap revenge on him.
Stop!

648
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,100
I'll do anything you want.

649
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:26,431
I'm a fool to have any feeling about
how Ezra Mannon dies.

650
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,619
Now you're the man I love again.

651
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,159
Not a hypocritical Mannon.

652
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:35,247
Do you hear?

653
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:37,415
The salute to his homecoming.

654
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,158
Remember your dreams
of your own ship.

655
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:47,421
Above all, remember you love me.
All your own. Your wife.

656
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,591
Now you must go.

657
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:52,989
She'll be coming back soon

658
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:55,043
and you're not good at hiding
your thoughts...

659
00:39:58,153 --> 00:40:00,300
Hurry.
I don't want you to meet her.

660
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:15,462
You'll never dare leave me now,
Adam.

661
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:20,277
For your ships, or your sea,
or your native island girls

662
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:23,358
when I grow old and ugly.

663
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:05,500
Father, oh, Father.
Vinnie.

664
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,080
Christine.
Ezra.

665
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:16,002
You're looking well, Christine.

666
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:17,700
And you're prettier than ever.

667
00:41:17,704 --> 00:41:20,016
Compliments from one's husband.

668
00:41:20,026 --> 00:41:22,075
How gallant you've become, Ezra.

669
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:23,701
Where is Orin?

670
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:26,911
Orin was wounded.
Wounded?

671
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:28,338
I knew it.

672
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:31,335
I knew when you forced him
into your horrible war.

673
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:34,170
He's dead, isn't he?
Don't say that.

674
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,400
It isn't true, is it, Father?
Of course it isn't.

675
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,110
Your mother's
jumping to conclusions about her baby.

676
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:41,428
I've made a man of him, Christine.

677
00:41:41,438 --> 00:41:44,248
He did one of the bravest things
I've seen in this war.

678
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:47,161
He's still weak but he'll be
perfectly all right in a few days.

679
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:50,662
I don't want you to baby him
when he comes home, Christine.

680
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:54,347
You needn't worry.
That passed when he left me.

681
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:56,702
The carriage is waiting, Ezra.

682
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:59,343
Welcome home, General,
welcome home.

683
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:00,358
How are you, Dr. Blake?

684
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,060
You've done a great job, sir.
This town is proud of you.

685
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:07,258
Terrible news, isn't it,
the assassination of President Lincoln?

686
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:10,034
We don't know what's going to happen
to the country now.

687
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:12,224
Yes, a frightful calamity.

688
00:42:12,234 --> 00:42:14,700
But it can't change the course
of events.

689
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,000
Let us hope not.

690
00:42:16,445 --> 00:42:18,114
You look tired, General.

691
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:21,200
You've been driving yourself too hard
for a man of your age.

692
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,330
Better let me give you a check-up
in a few days

693
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:25,720
as soon as you get rested.
I'm perfectly fit.

694
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,550
Yes, we know.
Well, I won't keep you now.

695
00:42:28,565 --> 00:42:31,525
Good night, sir.
Good night, Mrs Mannon, Miss Vinnie.

696
00:42:31,534 --> 00:42:32,800
Good night, Blake.

697
00:43:20,561 --> 00:43:21,561
Father.

698
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,252
Oh, Vinnie,
I'm looking for your mother.

699
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:25,165
I am out here, Ezra.

700
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:46,367
How is the trouble with your heart,
Father?

701
00:43:46,382 --> 00:43:49,201
Nothing to worry about.
I want to know the truth.

702
00:43:49,812 --> 00:43:52,032
If it had been serious I would
have told you.

703
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:56,089
If you had seen as much of death as I have
in the past four years

704
00:43:56,098 --> 00:43:57,848
you wouldn't be afraid of it.

705
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:02,109
I've had my fill of death.
What I want now is to forget it.

706
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,318
All I know is the pain's like a knife.

707
00:44:05,328 --> 00:44:06,968
Puts me out of commission while it lasts.

708
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:10,590
The doctor gave me orders to avoid
worry and excitement.

709
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:14,229
You don't look well, Ezra.

710
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:16,935
You must go to bed soon.

711
00:44:16,948 --> 00:44:19,558
Yes, I want to.

712
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:22,939
Not yet. Oh, please, Father.
We've hardly talked at all.

713
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:26,060
How can you tell him he looks tired.
He looks perfectly well.

714
00:44:27,073 --> 00:44:28,573
We've so much to tell you.

715
00:44:28,593 --> 00:44:30,863
All about Captain Brant.

716
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:34,150
Oh, yes. Vinnie wrote me you'd
had company.

717
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,120
What business had he here?

718
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:37,900
You'd better ask Vinnie.

719
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,880
He's her latest beau.

720
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,666
She even went walking
in the moonlight with him.

721
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:44,516
You didn't mention that in your letter,
young lady.

722
00:44:44,522 --> 00:44:46,901
I only went walking with him once.
And that was before I...

723
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,551
Before what?

724
00:44:48,568 --> 00:44:53,103
Before I found out he's the kind who
chases after every woman he sees.

725
00:44:53,112 --> 00:44:55,672
A fine guest to recieve in my absence.

726
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:58,110
I believe he thought even Mother
was flirting with him.

727
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,340
That's why I thought
it was my duty to write you.

728
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:03,404
I thought you should warn Mother
how foolish it was
to allow him to come here.

729
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:04,430
Foolish? It was downright...

730
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,121
I prefer not to discuss this ridiculous nonsense
until we are alone, Ezra,

731
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,789
if you don't mind.

732
00:45:10,038 --> 00:45:12,788
Vinnie, will you kindly leave us.

733
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,493
No, I will not.
It's Father's first night...

734
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,801
Stop this squabbling, both of you.
I won't have it in my house.

735
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:19,880
Vinnie, it must be your bedtime.

736
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:23,000
Yes, Father.

737
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:27,812
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.

738
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:29,942
You're the only man I'll ever love.

739
00:45:29,982 --> 00:45:32,182
I'm going to stay with you always.

740
00:45:32,223 --> 00:45:35,010
I hope so.
I want you to remain my little girl.

741
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:36,804
For a while longer, at least.

742
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:40,454
March now. To bed.

743
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:42,600
Yes, Father.

744
00:45:47,759 --> 00:45:49,592
Don't let anything worry you.

745
00:45:49,602 --> 00:45:51,862
I'm going to look after you always,
Father.

746
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:10,000
Sit down, Ezra.

747
00:46:15,341 --> 00:46:17,631
Now, please tell me...

748
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:19,977
just what is it you suspect me of?

749
00:46:21,084 --> 00:46:24,200
Oh, yes.
Your eyes have been probing me.

750
00:46:24,205 --> 00:46:28,600
And all on account of a stupid letter
Vinnie had no business to write.

751
00:46:28,615 --> 00:46:30,213
There's no question of suspecting you.

752
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,213
I only thought it was foolish to give
people in town a chance to gossip.

753
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:34,900
We'll say no more about it.

754
00:46:36,412 --> 00:46:40,022
But I'd like you to explain
how this Brant happened to be here.

755
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:42,620
I'm only too glad to.

756
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:45,000
I met him at Father's.

757
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:47,451
So when he called here
I couldn't be rude, could I?

758
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:51,600
And as for gossip the only talk
has been he came here to court Vinnie.

759
00:46:51,616 --> 00:46:54,856
Ask anyone in town.
Blast this impudence.

760
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:57,867
Perhaps I should have watched
Vinnie more closely

761
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,500
but Father's been sick and...

762
00:47:00,036 --> 00:47:03,500
you don't know what a strain
I've been under worrying about Orin.

763
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:06,500
And you, Ezra.
Christine...

764
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,800
I deeply regret having been unjust.

765
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,237
Afraid Old Johnny Red
would pick me out, were you?

766
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:16,506
Of course.

767
00:47:16,582 --> 00:47:20,011
I dreamed of coming home to you,
Christine.

768
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:23,432
You look more beautiful than ever.

769
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:25,411
And strange to me.

770
00:47:25,938 --> 00:47:27,938
You're younger.

771
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:30,759
I feel like an old man beside you.

772
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,400
I'm sorry, Ezra.

773
00:47:38,616 --> 00:47:40,213
I'm nervous tonight.

774
00:47:45,323 --> 00:47:47,133
I'm tired.

775
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:50,541
I shouldn't have bothered you
with this foolishness about Brant tonight.

776
00:47:51,252 --> 00:47:53,801
I can't get used to home yet.

777
00:47:56,317 --> 00:47:57,977
It's so lonely.

778
00:47:58,684 --> 00:48:02,644
I'm used to the feel of camps with
thousands of men around me at night.

779
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:04,822
The sense of protection maybe.

780
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:11,700
Don't be so still.

781
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:14,334
I want to talk to you, Christine.

782
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:17,500
I've got to explain some things
inside me to my wife.

783
00:48:17,512 --> 00:48:19,382
Shut your eyes again.

784
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:21,335
I can talk better.

785
00:48:21,347 --> 00:48:23,317
Don't talk, Ezra.

786
00:48:27,623 --> 00:48:30,723
It was seeing death all the time
in this war.

787
00:48:30,756 --> 00:48:33,716
Death was so common it didn't mean
anything.

788
00:48:34,732 --> 00:48:36,782
That freed me to think of life.

789
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:38,820
Queer, isn't it?

790
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,292
Death made me think of life.

791
00:48:41,302 --> 00:48:44,021
Before that life had only made me think
of death.

792
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:47,138
Why are you talking of death?

793
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:49,848
That's always been the Mannons'
way of thinking.

794
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:54,337
They went to the White Meeting House
on Sabbath and meditated on death.

795
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:58,921
Life was a dying,
being born was starting to die.

796
00:48:59,948 --> 00:49:02,000
Death was being born.

797
00:49:03,514 --> 00:49:06,354
How did people ever get such notions?

798
00:49:06,574 --> 00:49:10,524
What has this talk of death
to do with me?

799
00:49:10,543 --> 00:49:12,700
Shut your eyes again.

800
00:49:15,006 --> 00:49:17,936
I thought about my life
lying awake nights.

801
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:19,946
And about your life.

802
00:49:20,465 --> 00:49:24,212
As a soldier the thought
of my being killed didn't seem to matter.

803
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:27,429
But me as your husband being killed

804
00:49:27,644 --> 00:49:29,411
that seemed queer and wrong.

805
00:49:29,922 --> 00:49:32,772
Like someone dying that
had never lived.

806
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:37,327
And all the years we've been
man and wife would rise up in my mind.

807
00:49:38,544 --> 00:49:41,634
And I could only find some barrier
between us.

808
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:44,468
A wall hiding us from each other.

809
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,223
But what that wall was,
I could never discover.

810
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:53,057
I called to mind the Mexican War.

811
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,703
I could see you wanted me to go.

812
00:49:55,729 --> 00:49:58,429
I was hoping I might get killed.

813
00:49:59,437 --> 00:50:01,907
Maybe you were hoping that, too.

814
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:04,398
Were you?

815
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:05,611
No, no, I...

816
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:09,030
What makes you say such things?

817
00:50:09,748 --> 00:50:13,418
And when I came home
you were turned to your new baby, Orin.

818
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:15,924
I was hardly alive for you anymore.

819
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:18,873
I tried not to hate Orin and
I turned to Vinnie.

820
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:20,537
But a daughter's not a wife.

821
00:50:20,546 --> 00:50:23,126
Then I made up my mind
to do my work in the world

822
00:50:23,136 --> 00:50:25,326
and leave you alone and not care.

823
00:50:25,338 --> 00:50:27,301
That's why the shipping wasn't enough,

824
00:50:27,311 --> 00:50:30,231
why I became a judge
and Mayor and such vain truck.

825
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,971
Why folks in town say I'm so able.

826
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,158
Able for what?

827
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:37,403
Not for what I wanted most in life.

828
00:50:37,422 --> 00:50:38,800
Not for your love.

829
00:50:38,811 --> 00:50:42,600
No, able only to keep my mind
from thinking of what I'd lost.

830
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,110
You did love me before we were married,
didn't you, Christine?

831
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,500
You won't deny that, will you?

832
00:50:49,536 --> 00:50:50,785
I don't deny anything.

833
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,385
All right then. I came home
to surrender to you what's inside me.

834
00:50:54,445 --> 00:50:57,900
I love you. I loved you then and all the years in between.

835
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,024
And I love you now.
Ezra, please.

836
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,370
Help me to smash down that wall,
Christine.

837
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,266
We've twenty good years still before us.

838
00:51:04,588 --> 00:51:06,260
Help us to get back to each other.

839
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,382
If we could leave the children
and go on a voyage

840
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:10,091
to get to the other side of the world

841
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,511
and find some island
where we could be alone for a while.

842
00:51:12,525 --> 00:51:15,030
You'll find I've changed, Christine.

843
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,970
I'm sick of death. I want life.

844
00:51:16,984 --> 00:51:18,900
Stop talking, Ezra!

845
00:51:18,904 --> 00:51:21,070
I don't know what you're saying.

846
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,960
What must be must be.

847
00:51:22,977 --> 00:51:24,377
You make me weak.

848
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:28,000
It's getting late.

849
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:30,961
Yes.

850
00:51:32,116 --> 00:51:34,120
Time to turn in.

851
00:51:42,628 --> 00:51:45,468
You tell me to stop talking.

852
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:47,949
By heaven, that's funny.

853
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,520
I only meant
what's the good of words.

854
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:54,142
There is no wall between us.

855
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:55,367
I love you.

856
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,610
I'd give my soul to believe that, Christine.

857
00:51:58,644 --> 00:52:00,154
But I'm afraid.

858
00:52:06,178 --> 00:52:08,448
I thought you'd gone to bed,
young lady.

859
00:52:09,657 --> 00:52:11,827
I couldn't sleep.
I thought I'd walk a little.

860
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:14,571
No time for a walk, if you ask me.

861
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:16,613
We were just going to bed.

862
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:18,422
Your father is tired.

863
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,339
See you turn in soon.

864
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:25,724
Yes, Father.

865
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,210
Good night, Vinnie.

866
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:29,808
Good night.

867
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,627
Father, how can you love
that shameless woman?

868
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:07,443
I can't bear it.

869
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,770
I won't.

870
00:53:08,787 --> 00:53:10,740
It's my duty to tell him.
I will!

871
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,000
Father! Father!

872
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,250
Don't shout like that.
What is it?

873
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:21,624
I forgot to say good night.

874
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,120
Good heavens. What do you...

875
00:53:23,145 --> 00:53:26,120
Oh, all right.
Good night, Vinnie.

876
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,170
Go to bed soon, like a good girl.

877
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:29,500
Yes, Father.

878
00:53:32,102 --> 00:53:33,102
Good night.

879
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,644
Christine.

880
00:54:11,764 --> 00:54:14,104
What made you jump when I spoke?

881
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:16,751
I thought you were asleep.

882
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:18,961
I haven't been able to sleep.

883
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:22,317
I've been lying here thinking.

884
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:25,079
I haven't been able to sleep either.

885
00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:27,019
Don't light the candle.

886
00:54:27,032 --> 00:54:28,372
I want to see you.

887
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:37,100
You like the dark where you can't see
your old man of a husband, is that it?

888
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:40,000
If you're going to say stupid things
I'll go in my own room.

889
00:54:40,016 --> 00:54:41,016
Don't go.

890
00:54:42,605 --> 00:54:44,209
I don't want to be alone.

891
00:54:45,419 --> 00:54:47,600
I feel strange, Christine.

892
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,809
You mean ill?

893
00:54:51,323 --> 00:54:52,783
Your heart?

894
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:55,593
Is that what you're waiting for?

895
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,823
Stop talking like that.
Wait.

896
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:01,109
I'm sorry I said that.

897
00:55:01,312 --> 00:55:03,422
It isn't my heart.

898
00:55:05,438 --> 00:55:07,768
It's as if something in me were...

899
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:09,116
listening.

900
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:10,818
watching

901
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:13,800
waiting for something to happen.

902
00:55:15,002 --> 00:55:17,252
This house isn't my house.

903
00:55:17,274 --> 00:55:19,134
This room isn't my room.

904
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:21,743
They're empty.

905
00:55:21,784 --> 00:55:24,900
Waiting for someone to move in.

906
00:55:26,504 --> 00:55:28,334
And you're not my wife.

907
00:55:28,788 --> 00:55:30,628
You're waiting for something.

908
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,416
What would I be waiting for?

909
00:55:39,027 --> 00:55:42,090
For death to set you free.

910
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:47,920
Leave me alone. Stop nagging at me
with your crazy suspicions.

911
00:55:47,955 --> 00:55:51,200
Not your wife.
You act as if I were your wife,

912
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:52,340
your property.

913
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:55,349
You were lying to me as
you always lied.

914
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:58,067
You make me feel hateful
and unclean to myself.

915
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:02,200
I'd feel more honor between
myself and...
Look out, Ezra. I won't stand...

916
00:56:02,226 --> 00:56:04,556
I was hoping my homecomeing
would mark a new beginning

917
00:56:04,584 --> 00:56:06,190
a new love between us.

918
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,970
I told you my secret feelings.

919
00:56:08,984 --> 00:56:13,290
I tore my insides out for you thinking
you'd understand.

920
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,783
Did you think you could make me
forget all the years?

921
00:56:16,963 --> 00:56:19,443
Oh, no, Ezra. It's too late.

922
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:21,644
You want the truth?

923
00:56:21,655 --> 00:56:23,054
You've guessed it.

924
00:56:23,074 --> 00:56:25,072
I've never once been yours.

925
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:26,154
I never could be.

926
00:56:26,164 --> 00:56:29,800
Oh, I wanted to be when I married you
but you made it so I couldn't.

927
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:33,424
You filled me with disgust.
You say that to me.

928
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:35,290
No. Be quiet.

929
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,650
We mustn't fight.
It'll bring on the pain.

930
00:56:37,669 --> 00:56:40,300
You wanted the truth
and you're going to get it now.
Be quiet, Christine.

931
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,221
I lied about Captain Brant.

932
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:43,647
He's Marie Brantôme's son.

933
00:56:43,688 --> 00:56:45,868
And it was I he came to see,
not Vinnie.

934
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,100
You dare, the son of that...
All my trips to New York
weren't to visit Father...

935
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,600
but to be with Brant.

936
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:54,080
He's gentle and tender. He's everything
you've never been.

937
00:56:54,096 --> 00:56:58,455
I love him.
You common, vile... I'll kill you.

938
00:57:01,663 --> 00:57:03,723
Quick. The medicine.

939
00:57:19,984 --> 00:57:20,984
The medicine.

940
00:58:09,304 --> 00:58:10,304
Father.

941
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,200
He just had an attack.

942
00:58:12,216 --> 00:58:14,716
Father.
Oh, he's fainted.

943
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:17,833
He's all right now.
Let him sleep.

944
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:18,844
Father.

945
00:58:25,353 --> 00:58:27,263
She's guilty.

946
00:58:27,275 --> 00:58:30,555
Not... medicine.

947
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,840
Father.

948
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,655
It's my own.

949
00:58:35,669 --> 00:58:37,029
He's asleep.

950
00:58:41,002 --> 00:58:42,712
He's dead.

951
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:49,154
Why did he point at you like that?

952
00:58:50,085 --> 00:58:51,565
Why did he say you were guilty?

953
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,100
Well answer me!

954
00:58:54,215 --> 00:58:58,165
I told him the truth about Adam.

955
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,146
You told him that
when you knew his heart...

956
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:03,700
You did it on purpose.
You murdered him.

957
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,300
No, it was your fault.

958
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,121
You made him suspicious.

959
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:09,721
He forced me to tell him.
Look at me!

960
00:59:09,736 --> 00:59:11,610
He said not medicine.
What did he mean?

961
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:14,032
I don't know.
You do know. Tell me.

962
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:16,700
Are you accusing your mother of...
Yes, I am, you...

963
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:19,569
You can't be that evil.

964
00:59:21,188 --> 00:59:22,500
I feel faint.

965
00:59:22,508 --> 00:59:25,358
I must go and lie down, I...

966
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:33,517
You murdered him just the same
by telling him.

967
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:36,169
You think you'll be free now
to marry Adam.

968
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,340
But you won't.
Not while I'm alive.

969
01:00:08,165 --> 01:00:11,155
Father!
Don't leave me alone.

970
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:13,135
Come back to me.

971
01:00:13,585 --> 01:00:15,645
Tell me what to do.

972
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:19,225
Tell me what to do.

973
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:43,562
It isn't for me to question
the arrangements, Mrs Mannon...

974
01:00:43,597 --> 01:00:47,100
but it does seem as if Ezra
should have been laid out in Town Hall

975
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:49,554
where the whole town
could have paid their respects to him.

976
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:54,400
Yes, yes, remember he was
mayor of the town, a national war hero...

977
01:00:54,403 --> 01:00:58,432
Are you sure you don't want
a public funeral?

978
01:00:59,242 --> 01:01:01,932
It's not a question of what I want.

979
01:01:02,857 --> 01:01:06,357
I must follow out his wishes.
Yes, of course...

980
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:10,931
Well, I must say it's just like Ezra,
he liked things private and quiet.

981
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,768
Never was one for show.

982
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,180
Yes, he did the work
and let the others do the showing off.

983
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,430
Yes, indeed.

984
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,800
Good night, Mrs Mannon.
You have our deepest sympathies.

985
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,400
Has Orin come yet?

986
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:48,877
Not yet,
but they ought to be here soon.

987
01:01:48,883 --> 01:01:51,130
Can't you lie down, Mrs Mannon?

988
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,000
No, I should have gone to the train

989
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:59,900
but all those people coming
to stand around and stare at the dead.

990
01:02:00,058 --> 01:02:03,628
And at me.
I know, but there won't be
any more now.

991
01:02:03,643 --> 01:02:05,463
Come and sit down.

992
01:02:15,874 --> 01:02:18,680
I can't abide that woman.
There's something queer about her.

993
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,254
She looks terrible, doesn't she?

994
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,400
Queer the difference between her
and Lavinia the way they take his death.

995
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:26,136
Lavinia doesn't seem to fell the grief
as much as she ought to.

996
01:02:26,146 --> 01:02:29,552
Oh, she feels it all right.
Only she's too Mannon to show it.

997
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,104
She had a quarrel with her mother, too.
I heard it.

998
01:02:32,114 --> 01:02:34,634
What was it over?
She was going to the train alone.

999
01:02:34,648 --> 01:02:36,748
Her mother seemed real angry.

1000
01:02:36,788 --> 01:02:38,140
She bid Peter Niles go along.

1001
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,140
Josiah!
Coming, Emma.

1002
01:02:42,651 --> 01:02:45,671
I'm not surprised what's happened.
He had angina.

1003
01:02:45,684 --> 01:02:49,084
I knew it even before he got home
from the things he wrote his wife.

1004
01:02:49,094 --> 01:02:51,834
She was worried about him.
Naturally, doctor.

1005
01:02:51,846 --> 01:02:54,376
The minute they sent for me I knew
what had happened.

1006
01:02:54,394 --> 01:02:57,224
She'd given him his medicine
but it was too late.

1007
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:59,266
Too bad, too darn bad.

1008
01:02:59,384 --> 01:03:01,500
The town won't find another
as able as Ezra now.

1009
01:03:01,509 --> 01:03:04,011
No, that's right.
Come along, come along, my dear.

1010
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:27,318
Orin!

1011
01:03:27,693 --> 01:03:28,693
Vinnie!

1012
01:03:30,198 --> 01:03:34,000
Well, you certainly are a sight
for sore eyes.

1013
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:35,821
How are you, anyway you
bossy old fuss-buzzer?

1014
01:03:36,578 --> 01:03:37,578
Here's Peter.

1015
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,600
How are you, Peter?
Say, how are you, Orin,
that's the question.

1016
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:42,630
Oh, all right, I guess.
Where's Mother?

1017
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,340
At home.

1018
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:47,677
Reverend Hills is there
and some other people arranging
for the funeral.

1019
01:03:48,288 --> 01:03:49,288
Oh.

1020
01:03:51,671 --> 01:03:53,131
Oh, here, let me take care of that.

1021
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:54,550
Thanks, Peter.

1022
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:00,227
Howdy, Orin.
How are you, Seth?

1023
01:04:00,245 --> 01:04:01,611
Glad to see you.

1024
01:04:06,578 --> 01:04:07,758
Get on, boy.

1025
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:31,140
Home at last.

1026
01:04:31,154 --> 01:04:34,255
You don't know how I dreamed of this,
Vinnie.

1027
01:04:37,566 --> 01:04:40,356
The house looks ghostly and dead.

1028
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:42,400
It's only the moonlight, you chump.

1029
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,260
Like a tomb.

1030
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,950
That's what Mother used to call it.

1031
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:48,517
It is a tomb just now, Orin.

1032
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:50,917
I'd forgotten.

1033
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:53,424
I simply can't realize he's dead.

1034
01:04:54,442 --> 01:04:57,462
I never knew his heart was weak.
He told me the trouble wasn't serious.

1035
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:59,400
Father told you that?
Hm.

1036
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,730
I was hoping he had.

1037
01:05:00,738 --> 01:05:04,228
Peter, would you run along inside, please.

1038
01:05:04,241 --> 01:05:05,961
I want to speak with Orin a moment.

1039
01:05:05,976 --> 01:05:08,476
Sure. Sure, Vinnie.

1040
01:05:12,714 --> 01:05:13,714
What's wrong with you, Vinnie?

1041
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,976
Oh, I know what a shock his death
is to you.

1042
01:05:17,985 --> 01:05:20,311
Isn't it a shock to you, Orin?

1043
01:05:20,322 --> 01:05:21,969
Certainly, but...

1044
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:24,870
Oh, I can't explain. Give me a chance
to get used to things.

1045
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,337
How can you be so unfeeling?

1046
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:28,343
You wanted me to be a hero,
didn't you?

1047
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:30,744
Well, murdering doesn't improve
one's manners.

1048
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:34,425
Listen, Vinnie, what was that stuff
you wrote me about some...

1049
01:05:34,449 --> 01:05:36,429
Captain Brant coming to see Mother?

1050
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:38,105
There's no time to talk now.

1051
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:39,979
I want to warn you to be
on your guard.

1052
01:05:39,986 --> 01:05:43,120
Don't believe the lies she'll tell you.
Wait till you've talked to me.

1053
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,841
You mean Mother?

1054
01:05:45,751 --> 01:05:47,311
What are you talking about, anyway?

1055
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:50,600
Honestly, Vinnie, I thinks that's carrying
an everlasting squabble with Mother
a bit too far.

1056
01:05:50,626 --> 01:05:51,990
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1057
01:05:52,004 --> 01:05:54,844
What are you being so mysterious
about, anyway?

1058
01:05:54,858 --> 01:05:56,800
Is it Brant?

1059
01:05:57,005 --> 01:05:59,014
Why didn't you call me, Peter?

1060
01:05:59,034 --> 01:06:01,000
Orin!
Mother!

1061
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:05,130
My boy, my baby!
Oh, Mother, it's good to see you.

1062
01:06:05,148 --> 01:06:08,761
Poor darling.
How you must have suffered.

1063
01:06:08,771 --> 01:06:11,371
But it's all over now.
I've got you back again.

1064
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:14,000
Let's go in, dear.

1065
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:17,365
There's someone else waiting who will
be glad to see you.

1066
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:20,002
Remember, Orin.

1067
01:06:20,173 --> 01:06:21,550
Come on in, dear.

1068
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:01,005
Vinnie, I...

1069
01:07:01,445 --> 01:07:06,115
I appreciate your grief
has made you not quite normal.

1070
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:08,300
But now Orin is here, I...

1071
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:14,442
Don't stare like that.

1072
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,578
What did you do that night
after I fainted?

1073
01:07:19,386 --> 01:07:22,776
I've missed something, some...
medicine that...

1074
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:24,525
I take to make me sleep.

1075
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:32,425
You did... you found it.

1076
01:07:32,473 --> 01:07:35,823
But can't you see
how insane to suspect...

1077
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:38,233
And Doctor Blake knows
he died of...

1078
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:42,400
I see what you've been waiting for.

1079
01:07:42,418 --> 01:07:45,020
To tell Orin your lies
and get him to go to the police.

1080
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,200
Isn't that it?

1081
01:07:46,214 --> 01:07:48,500
Answer me when I speak to you.

1082
01:07:48,518 --> 01:07:50,510
What are you plotting?

1083
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,520
Mother!

1084
01:07:52,642 --> 01:07:54,256
Coming, dear.

1085
01:08:00,966 --> 01:08:03,846
The happiness
of seeing Orin was a little too much
for me.

1086
01:08:03,858 --> 01:08:06,448
I sudenly felt as if I were going
to faint.

1087
01:08:06,465 --> 01:08:08,300
So I rushed out in the fresh air.

1088
01:08:08,315 --> 01:08:09,545
Poor Mother.

1089
01:08:09,571 --> 01:08:10,671
She's worn out, Orin.

1090
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,155
I've been trying to get her
to go to bed
but she won't listen to me.

1091
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,215
Go to bed the minute he comes home?
I should say not.

1092
01:08:16,236 --> 01:08:17,550
You come and sit down.

1093
01:08:17,555 --> 01:08:19,635
You're not going to do anything
to make yourself feel ill...

1094
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:21,872
Having you back is the medicine I need.

1095
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,712
He's the one who needs looking after.

1096
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,118
Yes, Orin, you've got to take care
of yourself too.

1097
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:28,892
We'll look after you, Hazel and I,
won't we, dear?

1098
01:08:28,922 --> 01:08:30,164
Of course we will.

1099
01:08:30,175 --> 01:08:32,500
Don't stand, dear.
Come and sit down.

1100
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:35,042
Hazel, will you bring me that cushion?

1101
01:08:36,762 --> 01:08:38,372
We'll make you comfortable.

1102
01:08:40,092 --> 01:08:41,092
There.

1103
01:08:46,995 --> 01:08:48,200
Peter will be getting jealous.

1104
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,322
You'd better call Vinnie
and put a pillow behind him.

1105
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:53,072
I can't picture Vinnie being so soft.

1106
01:08:53,082 --> 01:08:56,151
You ought to see her with Father.
She was always fussing over him.

1107
01:08:56,171 --> 01:08:58,451
And he likes it.
Even though he does pretend...

1108
01:08:58,473 --> 01:09:01,153
Orin, you're talking as if he were alive.

1109
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:06,800
We'd all of us forgotten he was dead,
hadn't we?

1110
01:09:08,402 --> 01:09:10,000
I can't believe it even yet.

1111
01:09:12,086 --> 01:09:14,716
I feel him in this house, alive.

1112
01:09:14,763 --> 01:09:15,763
Orin!

1113
01:09:18,768 --> 01:09:21,338
Everything's changed in a queer way.

1114
01:09:22,382 --> 01:09:24,055
This house, all of us.

1115
01:09:25,276 --> 01:09:26,500
Except Father.

1116
01:09:26,521 --> 01:09:29,310
He'll always be here, the same.

1117
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:31,440
Don't you feel that, Mother?

1118
01:09:32,556 --> 01:09:34,500
You mustn't make her think of it, Orin.

1119
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:39,430
You're the same, Hazel.
Sweet and good.

1120
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:42,225
At least Hazel hasn't changed.

1121
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,541
Hazel will never change, I hope.

1122
01:09:44,558 --> 01:09:46,728
I'm glad you appreciate her.

1123
01:09:46,736 --> 01:09:48,336
Poor boy.

1124
01:09:48,341 --> 01:09:51,061
Does it pain now?
Not much.

1125
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:55,102
Not at all when your hand's there.

1126
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,262
You're so different. What is it?

1127
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:05,000
It's just that I'm getting old, dear.

1128
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:07,431
You're more beautiful than ever.

1129
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:09,471
And younger, too, somehow.

1130
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,480
That's not it.

1131
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:15,921
Maybe I can guess.

1132
01:10:15,947 --> 01:10:19,888
Younger and more beautiful.
Listen to that, Hazel.

1133
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:22,800
He's learned to be very gallant,
I must say.

1134
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,500
Do you remember, Hazel,

1135
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:29,800
how you waved your handkerchief to me
that day I set out to become a hero?

1136
01:10:30,696 --> 01:10:32,516
I thought you'd sprain your wrist.

1137
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:33,527
Orin.

1138
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:38,944
All the mothers and wives,
and sisters and girls are the same.

1139
01:10:38,962 --> 01:10:41,342
Some time, in some war...

1140
01:10:41,373 --> 01:10:44,600
they ought to make the women
take the men's place for a month or so.

1141
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:46,336
Give them a taste of murder.

1142
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:48,845
After that, maybe they'd stop...

1143
01:10:48,908 --> 01:10:51,900
waving handkerchiefs and gabbing
about heros.

1144
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:54,043
Orin...
Give it a rest, Orin, it's over.

1145
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:56,523
None of us liked it any more than you did.

1146
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,155
You're right, Peter.

1147
01:11:00,013 --> 01:11:02,263
I'm sorry, Hazel.
That was rotten of me.

1148
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:06,341
It was nothing.
I understand how you feel,
really I do.

1149
01:11:06,365 --> 01:11:07,930
Orin, come and see Father.

1150
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,060
You sounded just like him.

1151
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,660
I meant to look at him the first thing,
but...

1152
01:11:15,697 --> 01:11:17,547
I got to talking

1153
01:11:17,558 --> 01:11:19,558
No, wait!

1154
01:11:20,465 --> 01:11:22,925
Can't you let him have a minute
to rest?

1155
01:11:22,942 --> 01:11:24,922
You can see how worn out he is.

1156
01:11:24,964 --> 01:11:28,314
I've hardly had a chance to say
a word to you yet.

1157
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:30,356
Stay with me a little while,
won't you, dear?

1158
01:11:30,368 --> 01:11:32,710
Of course, Mother.
Don't be long, Orin.

1159
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,344
And remember what I said.

1160
01:11:36,155 --> 01:11:39,333
I think we must be getting home.

1161
01:11:39,434 --> 01:11:40,600
Yes, we must.

1162
01:11:40,632 --> 01:11:42,500
It was so kind of you to come.

1163
01:11:42,505 --> 01:11:44,700
Please come again, dear, soon.

1164
01:11:44,705 --> 01:11:47,134
You'll do Orin more good than anyone.

1165
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,171
Good night, Orin.

1166
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:51,170
Nice to have you back.
Good bye.

1167
01:12:23,287 --> 01:12:26,017
What's made you take
a fancy to Hazel all of a sudden?

1168
01:12:26,038 --> 01:12:28,338
You never used to like
my going around with her.

1169
01:12:28,661 --> 01:12:31,521
All I want now is your happiness, dear.

1170
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:35,319
I know how much
you used to like Hazel.

1171
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,253
It was just to make you jealous.

1172
01:12:37,276 --> 01:12:39,986
I haven't been home an hour
and you're trying to marry me off.

1173
01:12:39,992 --> 01:12:42,032
Must be anxious to get rid of me.

1174
01:12:42,054 --> 01:12:45,944
Don't say that.
Who is this Captain Brant
who's been calling on you?

1175
01:12:45,975 --> 01:12:49,615
On me? You mean on Lavinia,
don't you?

1176
01:12:49,623 --> 01:12:52,543
Wherever did you get that silly idea?

1177
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:56,811
Of course. Vinnie must have written you
the same nonsense she did your father.

1178
01:12:56,932 --> 01:12:58,762
She wrote him?

1179
01:12:58,773 --> 01:12:59,933
What did he do?

1180
01:12:59,947 --> 01:13:02,247
Why, he laughed at it, naturally.

1181
01:13:03,702 --> 01:13:05,872
I'm really worried about Vinnie,
dear.

1182
01:13:05,893 --> 01:13:08,983
She imagines the most fantastic things.

1183
01:13:08,992 --> 01:13:12,500
And that silly feud she's always had
with me is worse than ever.

1184
01:13:13,904 --> 01:13:16,324
She's not like us, Orin.

1185
01:13:16,336 --> 01:13:19,386
I feel you are really my
flesh and blood.

1186
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:21,500
She isn't, she's your father's.

1187
01:13:21,512 --> 01:13:23,632
You are a part of me.

1188
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:25,911
I feel that too, Mother.

1189
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:29,918
We had a secret little world of our own
in the old days, didn't we?

1190
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:32,567
No Mannons allowed,
that was our password.

1191
01:13:32,598 --> 01:13:34,918
It's what your father and Vinnie
could never forgive us.

1192
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:41,036
It may seem a hard thing to say
about the dead,

1193
01:13:41,052 --> 01:13:45,062
but the truth is your father
was jealous of you.

1194
01:13:45,583 --> 01:13:50,343
He hated you because he knew
I loved you better
than anything in the world.

1195
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:52,525
I knew he had it in for me...

1196
01:13:52,543 --> 01:13:54,943
but I never thought he went so far
as to hate me.

1197
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,601
He did, just the same.

1198
01:13:56,619 --> 01:14:00,319
All right, then,
I won't pretend I'm sorry he's dead.

1199
01:14:00,324 --> 01:14:03,554
Oh, how happy we'll be together,
you and I.

1200
01:14:03,579 --> 01:14:08,839
If you only won't let Vinnie
poison your mind against me
with her disgusting lies.

1201
01:14:10,459 --> 01:14:11,939
What lies?

1202
01:14:11,971 --> 01:14:14,201
You haven't told me about
that Brant yet.

1203
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:15,889
There's nothing to tell.

1204
01:14:15,897 --> 01:14:18,022
Except in Vinnie's morbid mind.

1205
01:14:18,733 --> 01:14:23,313
She worried and brooded
until I really believed
she went out of her head.

1206
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,000
She does seem strange, but...

1207
01:14:25,036 --> 01:14:28,121
Her craziness all works out in hatred for me.

1208
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,980
Take this Captain Brant of hers,
for example.

1209
01:14:31,995 --> 01:14:35,515
A stupid ship captain I happened to meet
at your grandfather's...

1210
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:38,949
took it into his silly head to call here
a few times without being asked.

1211
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:42,399
I honestly believe
Vinnie fell in love with him

1212
01:14:42,451 --> 01:14:46,251
but she soon discovered
that he wasn't after her at all.

1213
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:50,717
Whom was he after? You?

1214
01:14:50,723 --> 01:14:51,723
Orin,

1215
01:14:51,866 --> 01:14:55,223
you don't seem to realize
that I'm an old married woman

1216
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,163
with two grown-up children.

1217
01:14:58,278 --> 01:15:01,778
All he was after was to insinuate
himself as a family friend

1218
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:03,900
and use your father when
he came home

1219
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:05,465
to get him a better ship.

1220
01:15:05,474 --> 01:15:07,890
Oh, I soon saw through his little scheme

1221
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,187
and he'll never call here again,
I promise you that.

1222
01:15:10,197 --> 01:15:14,117
That's the whole of the great
Captain Brant scandal.

1223
01:15:14,526 --> 01:15:17,926
Are you satisfied now,
you jealous goose, you?

1224
01:15:19,043 --> 01:15:20,343
Mother.

1225
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,113
I'm a fool.

1226
01:15:24,123 --> 01:15:26,300
The war has got me silly, I guess.

1227
01:15:26,305 --> 01:15:29,265
It was Vinnie's fault
you ever went to war.

1228
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,320
I'll never forgive her for that.

1229
01:15:32,336 --> 01:15:35,545
But I was going to give you
an example
of her insane suspicions.

1230
01:15:35,755 --> 01:15:38,980
She decided that
because his name was Brant

1231
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,280
he must be the son of that nurse girl,
Marie Brantôme.

1232
01:15:42,298 --> 01:15:43,500
Isn't that crazy?

1233
01:15:43,552 --> 01:15:46,352
Do you imagine for a moment if he were,
he would ever come here to visit?

1234
01:15:46,382 --> 01:15:48,040
I'd like to see him try it.

1235
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,120
His mother brought disgrace
enough on our family without...

1236
01:15:50,139 --> 01:15:53,433
Orin, don't look like that.
You sound just like your...

1237
01:15:54,243 --> 01:15:56,813
But I haven't told you the worst yet.

1238
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,493
Vinnie actually accuses me,
your mother,

1239
01:16:00,503 --> 01:16:02,463
of being in love with that fool.

1240
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,820
And of having met him in New York
and gone to his room.

1241
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:07,443
I don't believe it. Vinnie couldn't.

1242
01:16:07,456 --> 01:16:08,756
I told you she had gone crazy.

1243
01:16:08,768 --> 01:16:11,150
Oh, it's too revolting, Orin.

1244
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,770
You don't know what I've had
to put up with.

1245
01:16:13,786 --> 01:16:14,966
Mother, please.

1246
01:16:14,979 --> 01:16:17,569
Please, Mother, don't cry.
Please.

1247
01:16:21,773 --> 01:16:25,463
I haven't told you
the most horrible thing of all.

1248
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:31,410
She suspects me
of having poisoned your father.

1249
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:32,423
What?

1250
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:35,271
That's too much.
She ought to be put in an asylum.

1251
01:16:35,282 --> 01:16:38,200
She found some medicine I take
to put me to sleep

1252
01:16:38,204 --> 01:16:40,080
and, to her crazy brain...

1253
01:16:40,093 --> 01:16:42,753
Oh, Orin, I'm so afraid of her.

1254
01:16:42,773 --> 01:16:44,523
She might even go to the police and...

1255
01:16:44,534 --> 01:16:47,541
There, there, Mother, don't worry.
I'll take care of her.

1256
01:16:47,553 --> 01:16:51,053
Orin, you are my boy,
my baby.

1257
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,155
Mother!

1258
01:16:54,172 --> 01:16:57,000
I could forgive you anything,
anything.

1259
01:16:57,013 --> 01:16:59,180
Except that about Brant.

1260
01:16:59,377 --> 01:17:01,827
I swear to you...
I know, Mother.

1261
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:06,088
And if I thought different
I'd show you I haven't been taught
to kill for nothing.

1262
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:07,099
Orin!

1263
01:17:07,351 --> 01:17:10,201
You sound horrible and cruel.
There, there...

1264
01:17:10,216 --> 01:17:12,500
We won't ever think about it again.

1265
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:15,043
We shouldn't be talking of these things
after what you've been through.

1266
01:17:15,057 --> 01:17:17,377
You don't look well, Mother.

1267
01:17:17,386 --> 01:17:19,000
You have to get some rest.

1268
01:17:19,004 --> 01:17:20,674
You need peace and quiet.

1269
01:17:20,686 --> 01:17:22,386
Yes, peace.

1270
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:31,378
Not now.

1271
01:18:20,683 --> 01:18:22,533
Do you remember the way
I used to sit here?

1272
01:18:26,245 --> 01:18:27,445
Poor boy.

1273
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:30,057
You've had a hard time,
haven't you?

1274
01:18:30,067 --> 01:18:32,527
I wanted to desert and run home.

1275
01:18:32,538 --> 01:18:33,938
Or else get killed.

1276
01:18:35,847 --> 01:18:38,467
If you only knew how I longed
to be here with you.

1277
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:40,219
Like this.

1278
01:18:42,641 --> 01:18:44,521
Do you remember that book we read?

1279
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:46,771
About the South Sea Islands.

1280
01:18:49,283 --> 01:18:50,383
Yes.

1281
01:18:51,622 --> 01:18:55,032
All the time I was at the front I kept
thinking of those islands.

1282
01:18:55,950 --> 01:18:59,400
They came to me in everything
that wasn't war, everything that was...

1283
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,836
peaceful and...

1284
01:19:01,955 --> 01:19:03,688
warm and secure.

1285
01:19:05,299 --> 01:19:07,212
I'd dream I was there.

1286
01:19:07,222 --> 01:19:09,222
Later on...

1287
01:19:09,485 --> 01:19:11,085
when I got this...

1288
01:19:11,237 --> 01:19:13,717
all the time I was out of my mind...

1289
01:19:15,265 --> 01:19:17,345
I actually seemed to be there.

1290
01:19:18,361 --> 01:19:20,521
There was no one there but
you and me and...

1291
01:19:22,242 --> 01:19:24,022
I was a child again.

1292
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:26,000
And the funny part is that...

1293
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:27,779
I never saw you...

1294
01:19:29,589 --> 01:19:31,809
I just felt you all around me.

1295
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,550
The breaking of the waves
was your voice...

1296
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,892
the sky was your eyes.

1297
01:19:38,902 --> 01:19:41,083
The whole island was you.

1298
01:19:43,593 --> 01:19:46,253
It was the most beautiful island
in the world.

1299
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:50,435
Oh, if only you had never gone away.

1300
01:19:51,249 --> 01:19:52,711
I'll never leave you again.

1301
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:56,442
I don't want Hazel or anyone.
You're my only girl.

1302
01:19:56,461 --> 01:19:59,181
Oh, Mother, it's going to be so wonderful
from now on.

1303
01:19:59,197 --> 01:20:02,847
We'll get Vinnie to marry Peter and then
we'll be just you and I.

1304
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:05,500
What do you want?

1305
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,953
Aren't you going down to see Father,
Orin?

1306
01:20:10,469 --> 01:20:12,600
Oh, all right.

1307
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:13,930
I'll go now.

1308
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:18,450
Vinnie!

1309
01:20:27,104 --> 01:20:30,534
You can go ahead now
and tell Orin anything you wish.

1310
01:20:31,546 --> 01:20:34,776
I told him how you lied
about my trips to New York.

1311
01:20:34,794 --> 01:20:36,244
For revenge.

1312
01:20:36,261 --> 01:20:38,400
Because you loved Adam Brant yourself.

1313
01:20:38,993 --> 01:20:41,900
So hadn't you better leave Orin
out of it?

1314
01:20:41,912 --> 01:20:44,112
You can't get him to go
to the police.

1315
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:47,960
And you are afraid to yourself, because
it would all come out.

1316
01:20:47,985 --> 01:20:51,000
Everything. Who Adam is and
your knowledge of it.

1317
01:20:51,011 --> 01:20:52,285
And your love for him.

1318
01:20:52,295 --> 01:20:54,915
Oh, believe me, I'd see to it
if it ever got to a trial.

1319
01:20:54,929 --> 01:20:58,420
I'll show you to the world as a daughter
who desired her mother's lover.

1320
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:01,830
And then tried to get her mother
hanged out of hatred and jealousy.

1321
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:06,017
Go on. Try and convince Orin
of my wickedness.

1322
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:09,618
He loves me. He hated his father.

1323
01:21:09,635 --> 01:21:11,700
He's glad he's dead.

1324
01:21:30,316 --> 01:21:33,246
Who are you? Just another corpse.

1325
01:21:33,269 --> 01:21:37,339
You and I have seen fields and hillsides
sown with them.

1326
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:38,600
And they meant nothing.

1327
01:21:40,114 --> 01:21:44,000
Nothing but a dirty joke
life plays on life.

1328
01:21:53,138 --> 01:21:55,808
Death sits so naturally on you.

1329
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:59,719
Death becomes the Mannons.

1330
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:04,779
You were always like the statue
of some eminent dead man

1331
01:22:05,449 --> 01:22:09,339
sitting on a chair in a park or straddling
a horse on a town square.

1332
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:12,420
looking out over the head of life

1333
01:22:12,437 --> 01:22:16,800
cutting it dead for the impropriety
of living.

1334
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:23,159
You never cared to know me in life,
old Stick-in-the-Mud.

1335
01:22:23,865 --> 01:22:26,445
But I really think we might
be friends now.

1336
01:22:26,466 --> 01:22:27,600
Orin.

1337
01:22:27,695 --> 01:22:31,180
Don't sneek around like that.
I'm jumpy enough without...

1338
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,983
What makes you say such a thing
to Father?

1339
01:22:45,297 --> 01:22:46,957
Have you no feeling?

1340
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,900
You folks at home take death
so solemnly.

1341
01:22:49,909 --> 01:22:51,919
You have to learn to mock
or go crazy.

1342
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:53,500
But the name you called him.

1343
01:22:54,614 --> 01:22:57,644
That was his nickname in the army.
Old Stick-in-the-Mud.

1344
01:22:57,657 --> 01:22:59,507
Grant himself started it.

1345
01:22:59,553 --> 01:23:02,200
Said that Father was no good
on the offensive, but...

1346
01:23:02,205 --> 01:23:06,010
he'd trust him to stick in the mud
and hold a position
until the cows come home.

1347
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:08,430
But he was your father and he's dead.

1348
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:10,400
You ought to be proud of him.

1349
01:23:10,409 --> 01:23:12,719
He was proud of you when he
came home.

1350
01:23:12,722 --> 01:23:15,632
He boasted you'd done one of
the bravest things in the war.

1351
01:23:18,341 --> 01:23:21,611
I'll tell you the joke of that
heroic deed.

1352
01:23:21,633 --> 01:23:24,153
I was always volunteering for extra danger.

1353
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:26,681
I was so scared that anyone
would guess I was afraid.

1354
01:23:28,093 --> 01:23:29,093
Well...

1355
01:23:29,241 --> 01:23:31,691
that night there was a thick mist.

1356
01:23:31,701 --> 01:23:34,500
I met a Reb crawling toward our lines.

1357
01:23:34,517 --> 01:23:37,777
His face drifted out of the mist
toward mine.

1358
01:23:38,882 --> 01:23:40,152
I shortened my sword

1359
01:23:41,069 --> 01:23:44,000
and let him have the point
just under the ear.

1360
01:23:45,113 --> 01:23:48,143
He stared at me with an idiotic look...

1361
01:23:48,165 --> 01:23:50,315
as if he'd sat on a tack.

1362
01:23:51,723 --> 01:23:54,333
His eyes dimmed and went out.

1363
01:23:54,844 --> 01:23:56,424
Don't think about that now.

1364
01:23:56,437 --> 01:23:59,617
Before I got back I had to kill another
the same way.

1365
01:24:00,006 --> 01:24:02,416
It felt like murdering the same man twice.

1366
01:24:02,427 --> 01:24:06,500
I had a queer feeling that war meant
murdering the same man

1367
01:24:06,502 --> 01:24:08,442
over and over and...

1368
01:24:08,452 --> 01:24:10,052
and that in the end

1369
01:24:10,148 --> 01:24:12,988
the man turned out to be myself.

1370
01:24:14,796 --> 01:24:17,800
Their faces keep coming back
in dreams.

1371
01:24:17,805 --> 01:24:21,035
They change to Father's and...

1372
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:22,083
to mine...

1373
01:24:22,096 --> 01:24:24,226
For heaven's sake, forget the war.
It's over now.

1374
01:24:24,235 --> 01:24:26,735
Not inside us who've killed.

1375
01:24:28,269 --> 01:24:30,069
The rest is all a joke.

1376
01:24:30,097 --> 01:24:31,900
Next morning I was in the trenches.

1377
01:24:31,915 --> 01:24:34,365
My head was queer.

1378
01:24:34,379 --> 01:24:39,600
I thought, what a joke it would be
on the stupid Generals like Father if...

1379
01:24:39,612 --> 01:24:44,422
everyone on both sides suddenly saw
the joke war was on them

1380
01:24:44,434 --> 01:24:46,864
and laughed and shook hands.

1381
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:52,971
So I began to laugh and walked
towards their lines with my hand out.

1382
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:55,260
Of course the joke was on me.

1383
01:24:55,277 --> 01:24:57,407
I got this wound in the head.

1384
01:24:57,414 --> 01:25:01,124
Then I went mad, wanted to kill
and ran on yelling.

1385
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,350
A lot of our fools went crazy, too

1386
01:25:05,382 --> 01:25:07,102
and followed me.

1387
01:25:07,118 --> 01:25:11,918
And we captured a part of their lines
we hadn't dared to tackle before.

1388
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,126
So, do you wonder I laugh.

1389
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:17,750
But you are brave, and you know it.

1390
01:25:17,762 --> 01:25:19,162
I'm proud of you too.

1391
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,560
Oh, all right, then.

1392
01:25:21,585 --> 01:25:22,905
Be proud.

1393
01:25:22,921 --> 01:25:27,311
Well, fire away. Let's get this over.
I know what you're going to say.

1394
01:25:27,328 --> 01:25:30,100
How can you think such things of Mother.
What's got into you?

1395
01:25:30,106 --> 01:25:32,600
Has she convinced you
I'm out of my mind?

1396
01:25:32,613 --> 01:25:34,103
Look at me.

1397
01:25:34,117 --> 01:25:36,817
I've never lied to you, have I?
It's not a question of lying.

1398
01:25:36,826 --> 01:25:39,636
But if you think I'm going to listen
to a lot of crazy stuff about Mother,
you're mistaken.

1399
01:25:39,672 --> 01:25:41,412
If you don't, I'll go to the police.

1400
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:44,658
Do you actually believe...
I accuse her of murder.

1401
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:46,053
You see this?

1402
01:25:46,072 --> 01:25:48,222
I found it by her hand right after
Father died.

1403
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:50,212
Don't be a lunatic.

1404
01:25:50,632 --> 01:25:53,032
That's just some stuff she takes
to make her sleep.

1405
01:25:53,063 --> 01:25:54,881
Father knew she'd poisoned him.

1406
01:25:54,891 --> 01:25:56,421
He said to me she's guilty.

1407
01:25:56,432 --> 01:25:59,332
That's all your crazy imagination.

1408
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:02,002
Do you realize you're deliberately
accusing your own mother...

1409
01:26:02,315 --> 01:26:06,700
I'll have you declared insane by Dr. Blake
and put away in an asylum.

1410
01:26:06,712 --> 01:26:09,077
I swear by our dead father that I'm
telling you the truth.

1411
01:26:09,088 --> 01:26:11,668
Make Orin believe me, Father.

1412
01:26:11,674 --> 01:26:13,304
Don't drag him into this.

1413
01:26:13,312 --> 01:26:15,600
He always sided with you against
Mother and me.

1414
01:26:15,608 --> 01:26:17,558
Here, give me that.

1415
01:26:17,568 --> 01:26:20,308
So you're afraid it's true.
I'm not going to talk to a crazy woman.

1416
01:26:20,312 --> 01:26:24,162
You're still a spoiled cry baby
she can twist around her finger.

1417
01:26:24,176 --> 01:26:25,246
That's enough from you.

1418
01:26:25,257 --> 01:26:26,927
She warned me
you wouldn't believe me.

1419
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,660
Are you such a coward you're willing
to let her lover go unpunished?

1420
01:26:31,379 --> 01:26:32,609
Who do you mean?

1421
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,956
I mean the man who must have got
the poison for her.

1422
01:26:34,966 --> 01:26:36,100
Captain Brant.

1423
01:26:36,197 --> 01:26:39,700
You lie. She told me all your rotten lies
about following her to New York...

1424
01:26:39,714 --> 01:26:41,400
What a fool you are, Orin.

1425
01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:43,169
She kisses you and pretends
she loves you.

1426
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,518
All she thinks about is Brant.
Stop, I won't stand...

1427
01:26:45,522 --> 01:26:47,642
All she's thinking right now
is how she can use you against me

1428
01:26:47,655 --> 01:26:49,105
so she can run off and marry him.

1429
01:26:49,129 --> 01:26:51,209
You lie.
I saw her in his arms kissing him.

1430
01:26:51,999 --> 01:26:54,349
Tell me you're lying or...
You know I'm not lying.

1431
01:26:55,857 --> 01:26:58,317
You're not insane.
You know what you're saying but...

1432
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,650
you'll have to prove it, otherwise...
There is a chance to prove it.

1433
01:27:00,668 --> 01:27:02,848
And when I do will you help me punish
Father's murderers?

1434
01:27:02,861 --> 01:27:03,961
I'll kill him.

1435
01:27:06,007 --> 01:27:07,867
But it's only your word against hers.

1436
01:27:07,894 --> 01:27:09,844
She'll go to Brant
the first chance she gets.

1437
01:27:09,855 --> 01:27:11,290
Would you believe me
if you found them together?

1438
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,057
Yes.
Just let me get my hands on him.

1439
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:18,566
Orin.

1440
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:22,771
I can't face her now.

1441
01:27:22,786 --> 01:27:25,676
Pretend you think I'm insane.
She wanted you to.

1442
01:27:26,282 --> 01:27:27,382
Orin.

1443
01:27:27,661 --> 01:27:29,700
Why don't you answer me?

1444
01:27:29,706 --> 01:27:33,446
Why have you locked me out?
Let me in.

1445
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:35,969
Answer her.

1446
01:27:36,173 --> 01:27:37,683
Let her in.

1447
01:27:39,497 --> 01:27:41,037
All right, Mother.

1448
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:42,600
I'm coming.

1449
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Wait.

1450
01:27:50,004 --> 01:27:51,120
Now open the door.

1451
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,125
Orin.

1452
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:56,222
Let me in.

1453
01:27:58,505 --> 01:27:59,505
Orin.

1454
01:28:03,922 --> 01:28:06,988
I got so afraid
when I found the door locked.

1455
01:28:07,799 --> 01:28:09,569
What made you afraid, Mother?

1456
01:28:09,572 --> 01:28:12,222
Why do you look at me like that?

1457
01:28:12,257 --> 01:28:15,927
You look so like your father.

1458
01:28:15,935 --> 01:28:18,065
I'm his son too, remember that.

1459
01:28:18,078 --> 01:28:19,078
Orin.

1460
01:28:19,521 --> 01:28:22,041
I suppose you've been telling him
your vile lies.

1461
01:28:22,062 --> 01:28:24,900
She's out of her mind, Mother.
I knew you'd say that.

1462
01:28:24,909 --> 01:28:28,209
I know she's plotting something, Orin.

1463
01:28:28,217 --> 01:28:33,067
Did she threaten to go to the police?
They might not realize she's crazy.

1464
01:28:33,078 --> 01:28:36,178
You won't let her do anything dreadful
like that, will you?

1465
01:28:36,225 --> 01:28:38,225
No, Mother.
No...

1466
01:28:40,573 --> 01:28:43,803
Remember your father wouldn't want
any scandal.

1467
01:28:44,734 --> 01:28:46,744
He mustn't be worried, he said.

1468
01:28:46,753 --> 01:28:51,473
He needs rest and peace.

1469
01:28:58,191 --> 01:29:01,131
You haven't changed, Ezra.

1470
01:29:01,744 --> 01:29:04,414
You were always dead to me.

1471
01:29:05,326 --> 01:29:07,716
I hate the sight of death.

1472
01:29:09,029 --> 01:29:10,709
Mother, be quiet!

1473
01:29:16,856 --> 01:29:19,046
Why did I come back to life

1474
01:29:19,062 --> 01:29:21,400
from my island of peace?

1475
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,700
That's lost now.

1476
01:29:25,702 --> 01:29:28,410
You're my lost island,
aren't you, Mother?

1477
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:32,720
Orin.

1478
01:29:33,737 --> 01:29:37,127
It was Brant who got you this medicine
to make you sleep, wasn't it?

1479
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:38,651
No, no, no.

1480
01:29:38,677 --> 01:29:40,127
You're telling me it was. I knew it.

1481
01:29:40,137 --> 01:29:41,577
I wanted to make sure.

1482
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:42,581
Vinnie.

1483
01:29:42,694 --> 01:29:45,294
Keep Orin out of this. He's changed.

1484
01:29:45,331 --> 01:29:49,611
He's grown hard and cruel.
Have mercy, Vinnie. Don't let Orin...

1485
01:29:51,526 --> 01:29:52,526
Ezra...

1486
01:29:53,202 --> 01:29:55,582
Don't let her harm Adam.

1487
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,840
I am the only guilty one.

1488
01:29:57,861 --> 01:29:59,731
Don't let Orin...

1489
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,320
I'm going to see Adam.

1490
01:30:08,232 --> 01:30:10,142
I've got to warn him.

1491
01:30:19,746 --> 01:30:24,446
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you

1492
01:30:24,592 --> 01:30:30,292
A-way my rolling river

1493
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:35,419
Oh, Shenandoah, I can't get near you

1494
01:30:35,614 --> 01:30:40,514
Way-ay, I'm bound away

1495
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:47,700
Across the wide Missouri.

1496
01:30:49,245 --> 01:30:54,645
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter

1497
01:30:55,381 --> 01:30:59,931
A-way my lonely river

1498
01:32:09,871 --> 01:32:12,321
Like him, a coward.

1499
01:32:13,266 --> 01:32:17,696
Aye, it's the rotten Mannon blood in me.

1500
01:32:17,754 --> 01:32:18,814
Who's there?

1501
01:32:19,365 --> 01:32:21,435
Adam.
Christine.

1502
01:32:22,438 --> 01:32:24,028
Go to the gangway.
I'll meet you there.

1503
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Orin.

1504
01:32:39,129 --> 01:32:41,289
Don't be a fool. He'll kill you.

1505
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,500
Oh, Adam.

1506
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:54,711
I am so frightened.

1507
01:32:55,633 --> 01:32:56,743
Is something wrong?

1508
01:32:56,754 --> 01:32:58,104
What is it, Christine?

1509
01:32:58,114 --> 01:32:59,614
Vinnie knows.

1510
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,800
What's she going to do?

1511
01:33:02,894 --> 01:33:04,594
I don't know.

1512
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:08,266
How did you get away?
She followed you once before.

1513
01:33:08,277 --> 01:33:11,227
I thought I heard someone.
No, it's all right.

1514
01:33:11,238 --> 01:33:15,458
I made Orin believe she's
out of her head with grief, insane.

1515
01:33:15,584 --> 01:33:19,400
He decided that a change of scene
would bring her back to her senses.

1516
01:33:19,405 --> 01:33:22,755
He took her this morning to Blackridge
to visit their cousins.

1517
01:33:22,885 --> 01:33:24,835
I had to come and warn you.

1518
01:33:24,853 --> 01:33:29,277
Oh, Adam, we've got to plan.
There isn't much time.

1519
01:33:29,288 --> 01:33:30,188
Shhh.

1520
01:33:30,253 --> 01:33:32,333
We're fools to be talking out here.

1521
01:33:47,449 --> 01:33:50,469
I'll kill him now, in front of her.
Stop thinking of her.

1522
01:33:50,484 --> 01:33:52,480
Think of Father, think of the family,
of us.

1523
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,160
Don't be crazy.

1524
01:34:00,018 --> 01:34:04,228
When he was dying he pointed at me
and told her I was guilty.

1525
01:34:04,436 --> 01:34:05,996
Then she found the poison.

1526
01:34:06,049 --> 01:34:07,609
For heaven's sake, why didn't...

1527
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:08,921
I fainted before I could hide it.

1528
01:34:08,936 --> 01:34:12,556
How could I foresee she
would come in just at that moment?

1529
01:34:12,969 --> 01:34:16,449
And how could I know he would talk
to me the way he did?

1530
01:34:17,158 --> 01:34:20,758
I only wanted him to die
and leave me alone.

1531
01:34:20,868 --> 01:34:22,828
But he knew before he died
whose son I was.

1532
01:34:22,839 --> 01:34:24,339
Good!

1533
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:26,948
Oh, I planned it so carefully.

1534
01:34:26,951 --> 01:34:29,751
But something made things happen.

1535
01:34:29,853 --> 01:34:31,323
I should have done as I wanted.

1536
01:34:31,337 --> 01:34:34,257
Fought with Ezra Mannon as two men
fight for the love of a woman.

1537
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:37,930
I have my father's rotten blood in me,
I think.

1538
01:34:39,441 --> 01:34:41,331
It's too late for regrets now.

1539
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:42,810
We have to think what to do.

1540
01:34:42,828 --> 01:34:44,128
I'm so terrified of Vinnie.

1541
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:47,600
If she convinces Orin...
Oh, why can't we go away, Adam?

1542
01:34:47,603 --> 01:34:49,500
My ship won't be sailing for a month.

1543
01:34:49,516 --> 01:34:51,006
Can't we go on another ship?

1544
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:53,288
Everyone in town would know
that you'd gone.

1545
01:34:53,297 --> 01:34:54,817
It would start suspicion.

1546
01:34:54,823 --> 01:34:57,833
No, Orin and Vinnie would lie to people.

1547
01:34:57,872 --> 01:35:00,222
They'd have to, for their own sakes.

1548
01:35:00,234 --> 01:35:03,924
Oh, Adam, if we don't get out of Vinnie's
reach right away

1549
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:05,640
something horrible will happen.

1550
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:08,540
Aye, I suppose it's the only way.

1551
01:35:10,065 --> 01:35:12,135
The Atlantis sails on Friday for China.

1552
01:35:12,147 --> 01:35:14,217
I'll arrange with the skipper to give us passage.

1553
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:16,400
You'd better meet me here
Thursday night.

1554
01:35:17,513 --> 01:35:20,300
I'll write the owners
they'll have to find a new skipper

1555
01:35:20,359 --> 01:35:22,179
for the Flying Trades.

1556
01:35:22,186 --> 01:35:24,056
Poor Adam.

1557
01:35:24,065 --> 01:35:27,705
I know how it hurts you
to give up your ship.

1558
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:31,362
There are plenty of ships.
There's only one you, Christine.

1559
01:35:31,377 --> 01:35:35,337
I brought you nothing but misfortune.

1560
01:35:35,345 --> 01:35:36,555
You brought love.

1561
01:35:36,575 --> 01:35:40,305
The rest is only the price.
It's worth it a million times.

1562
01:35:41,011 --> 01:35:43,221
You're all mine now anyway.

1563
01:35:43,233 --> 01:35:46,033
Try not to regret your ship
too much, Adam.

1564
01:35:46,952 --> 01:35:48,722
Let's not talk about it anymore.

1565
01:35:49,648 --> 01:35:53,258
I'll give up the sea.
I thinks it's through with me, anyway.

1566
01:35:53,278 --> 01:35:57,628
The sea hates a coward.
Don't talk like that.

1567
01:35:57,649 --> 01:36:00,749
We'll be happy once we're safe
on your blessed islands.

1568
01:36:01,027 --> 01:36:03,027
It's strange.

1569
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:05,649
Orin was telling me of an island.

1570
01:36:05,682 --> 01:36:08,012
Aye, the blessed isles.

1571
01:36:08,034 --> 01:36:12,534
Maybe we can still find happiness
and forget.

1572
01:36:13,138 --> 01:36:15,400
I can see them now.

1573
01:36:16,008 --> 01:36:17,828
The warm earth in the moonlight...

1574
01:36:17,884 --> 01:36:20,654
The trade winds rustling the palms...

1575
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:25,247
The surf on the barrier reef crooning
in your ears like a lullaby.

1576
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:29,100
Aye, there's peace and forgetfulness
for us there.

1577
01:36:30,813 --> 01:36:33,200
If we can ever find those islands now.

1578
01:36:33,214 --> 01:36:35,164
We will find them.

1579
01:36:35,191 --> 01:36:36,300
We will.

1580
01:36:41,409 --> 01:36:42,929
I've got to go now.

1581
01:36:45,058 --> 01:36:46,428
Watch out for Vinnie.

1582
01:36:46,478 --> 01:36:48,140
If anything happened to you now...

1583
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:49,520
Nothing will happen to me.

1584
01:36:49,526 --> 01:36:52,026
But you must be on your guard
in case Orin...

1585
01:36:53,344 --> 01:36:55,124
Oh, be careful, Adam.

1586
01:36:56,842 --> 01:36:58,412
I feel so strange.

1587
01:36:58,435 --> 01:37:00,525
So sad.

1588
01:37:00,585 --> 01:37:03,145
As if I'd never see you again.

1589
01:37:05,168 --> 01:37:07,748
Tell me we are going to be happy.

1590
01:37:08,994 --> 01:37:10,444
Of course we'll be happy.

1591
01:37:11,658 --> 01:37:12,878
Come now.

1592
01:37:14,690 --> 01:37:16,570
It's only a couple of days.

1593
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:32,454
Let me go.
No. Be quiet.

1594
01:37:32,478 --> 01:37:33,900
Come to his cabin.

1595
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:43,710
Death is too good for him.
He ought to be...

1596
01:37:43,759 --> 01:37:46,519
Orin, you promised not to lose your head.

1597
01:37:46,546 --> 01:37:49,156
Did you hear her warn him
against me?

1598
01:37:49,166 --> 01:37:52,566
And the island that I told her about.
She wants to go there with him.

1599
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:56,000
Why did you stop me?
I'd have shot his guts out
in front of her.

1600
01:37:56,018 --> 01:37:58,268
Outside on deck where the shot
could be heard?

1601
01:37:58,285 --> 01:38:01,691
We'd be arrested.
I'd have to tell the truth to save you.

1602
01:38:01,701 --> 01:38:05,121
She'd be hanged
but even if we managed to get off
our lives would be ruined.

1603
01:38:05,134 --> 01:38:07,011
Father's name would be disgraced.

1604
01:38:07,022 --> 01:38:09,950
The only person to come off lucky
would be Brant.

1605
01:38:09,966 --> 01:38:12,280
He'd die happy knowing
he'd been revenged on all of us.

1606
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:13,681
Is that what you want?
No.

1607
01:38:13,691 --> 01:38:14,930
Then don't act like a fool again.

1608
01:38:14,936 --> 01:38:16,356
He's coming.

1609
01:38:16,361 --> 01:38:18,881
Go, then. Go on.

1610
01:38:48,299 --> 01:38:50,699
So it's goodbye to you, Flying Trades.

1611
01:38:50,881 --> 01:38:54,361
I wasn't man enough for you.

1612
01:39:07,073 --> 01:39:08,713
Don't stand there.

1613
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:10,011
Remember the plan.

1614
01:39:10,023 --> 01:39:12,103
Smash open everything in his stateroom.

1615
01:39:12,115 --> 01:39:13,700
Take everything valuable.

1616
01:39:13,706 --> 01:39:15,536
You've got to make it look
like the work of thieves, remember.

1617
01:39:16,449 --> 01:39:17,549
Hurry.

1618
01:39:25,771 --> 01:39:27,041
Hurry, Orin.

1619
01:39:27,059 --> 01:39:28,850
Don't tell me what to do.

1620
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:45,758
How could you love
that vile old woman so?

1621
01:39:48,275 --> 01:39:49,383
But you did.

1622
01:39:50,393 --> 01:39:51,700
It's ended.

1623
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:02,392
May God find forgiveness
for your sins.

1624
01:40:03,422 --> 01:40:08,147
May the soul of our cousin, Adam Mannon,
rest in peace.

1625
01:40:08,157 --> 01:40:10,900
Rest in hell, you mean.

1626
01:40:11,641 --> 01:40:13,181
I've pried open everything
I could find.

1627
01:40:13,194 --> 01:40:14,194
Come along, quickly.

1628
01:40:14,230 --> 01:40:16,200
I must go through his pockets first
to make it look like a robbery.

1629
01:40:19,408 --> 01:40:21,448
I'll sink this stuff from the dock.

1630
01:40:21,462 --> 01:40:23,430
There's the pistol. Don't forget it.

1631
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:29,540
Orin.

1632
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:32,148
He looks like Father.

1633
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,159
Come along.

1634
01:40:33,668 --> 01:40:35,558
Just like my dream.

1635
01:40:35,563 --> 01:40:38,400
I've killed him before, over and over.

1636
01:40:45,003 --> 01:40:47,023
It's like me, too.

1637
01:40:47,043 --> 01:40:49,713
Maybe I've committed suicide.

1638
01:40:49,734 --> 01:40:50,734
Orin.

1639
01:40:52,228 --> 01:40:54,458
If I were in his place
I would have done what he did.

1640
01:40:54,878 --> 01:40:56,748
I'd have loved her as he loved her.

1641
01:40:57,699 --> 01:41:00,542
And killed Father, too, for her sake.

1642
01:41:00,572 --> 01:41:02,600
For heaven's sake,
do you want us to be caught here?

1643
01:41:04,412 --> 01:41:05,609
It's queer.

1644
01:41:06,419 --> 01:41:09,339
It's a rotten dirty joke on someone.

1645
01:41:55,547 --> 01:41:57,600
Orin. Vinnie.

1646
01:41:57,602 --> 01:42:01,242
It's me, Ma'am.
I was just going down the street.

1647
01:42:01,254 --> 01:42:04,314
You're sure you met the train
from Blackridge?

1648
01:42:04,326 --> 01:42:07,526
Ayeh, weren't a sign of 'em.

1649
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:10,741
They should have been back
this morning.

1650
01:42:11,267 --> 01:42:14,437
I'm worried. And frightened.

1651
01:42:14,446 --> 01:42:16,400
You want I should stay here?

1652
01:42:17,007 --> 01:42:18,007
No.

1653
01:42:19,431 --> 01:42:21,521
You oughta try to get some sleep,
Ma'am.

1654
01:42:32,752 --> 01:42:34,402
Sleep.

1655
01:42:34,442 --> 01:42:38,700
I don't believe there is such a thing
on this earth as sleep.

1656
01:42:38,712 --> 01:42:41,400
It's only in the earth one sleeps.

1657
01:42:41,702 --> 01:42:46,542
One must feel so at peace at last,
with all one's fears ended.

1658
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,290
Why do you stare at me like that?

1659
01:43:00,302 --> 01:43:03,700
You Mannons. I hate you.

1660
01:43:34,718 --> 01:43:37,158
Why am I so afraid?

1661
01:43:42,385 --> 01:43:44,765
Orin. Vinnie.

1662
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:55,900
So this time at least you're waiting
to meet me when I come home.

1663
01:43:56,607 --> 01:43:57,707
Orin...

1664
01:43:57,851 --> 01:44:00,400
I've been so frightened.

1665
01:44:00,502 --> 01:44:03,112
You stayed all this time at Blackridge?

1666
01:44:03,128 --> 01:44:05,043
We didn't go to Blackridge.

1667
01:44:05,063 --> 01:44:08,303
We took the train there but we decided
to stay right on and go to Boston instead.

1668
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:12,259
To Boston?
And in Boston we waited till
the evening train came in.

1669
01:44:12,283 --> 01:44:15,243
We had an idea you might be on it
and you were.

1670
01:44:15,255 --> 01:44:17,455
We followed you
when you called on your lover.

1671
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,161
Orin, how dare you talk like...
Don't lie.

1672
01:44:19,879 --> 01:44:21,430
I was on deck listening.

1673
01:44:21,439 --> 01:44:23,739
What would you have done
if you discovered me?

1674
01:44:23,764 --> 01:44:25,474
Would you have gotten him
to murder me, Mother?

1675
01:44:25,498 --> 01:44:29,238
Orin, what have you done? Tell me.
I killed him.

1676
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:36,401
Oh, no, Orin. You're just telling that to me to punish me, aren't you?

1677
01:44:36,418 --> 01:44:38,458
You said you loved me,

1678
01:44:38,485 --> 01:44:40,975
protect me. Protect your mother.

1679
01:44:40,982 --> 01:44:44,132
You couldn't murder.
You could murder Father, couldn't you?

1680
01:44:44,151 --> 01:44:45,980
Here. Read this if you don't believe me.

1681
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,541
We waited and got it in Boston
to see whom the police would suspect.

1682
01:44:49,254 --> 01:44:51,464
They'll think he was killed
by waterfront thieves.

1683
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,116
There's nothing to connect us
with his death.

1684
01:45:00,326 --> 01:45:02,316
Mother, don't moan like that.

1685
01:45:04,227 --> 01:45:06,437
How can you grieve for that swine?

1686
01:45:06,445 --> 01:45:09,365
I know it was he who planned
Father's murder.
You couldn't have done that.

1687
01:45:09,377 --> 01:45:12,000
He got you under his influence
so as to revenge himself.

1688
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:14,366
I knew you weren't yourself
the moment I got home, remember?

1689
01:45:14,396 --> 01:45:17,899
How else could you have imagined
you loved the son of a servant?

1690
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:19,818
How else could you ever have said
the things you...

1691
01:45:19,999 --> 01:45:23,126
I heard you planning to go with him
to the island.

1692
01:45:23,136 --> 01:45:24,300
Our island.

1693
01:45:24,305 --> 01:45:27,275
Mother, don't moan like that.

1694
01:45:27,282 --> 01:45:29,162
You'll forget him.
I'll make you forget him.

1695
01:45:29,185 --> 01:45:33,125
We'll leave Vinnie here and we'll go away
on a long voyage to the South Seas.

1696
01:45:33,181 --> 01:45:34,191
Orin.

1697
01:45:34,346 --> 01:45:36,511
Mother. Mother.

1698
01:45:37,622 --> 01:45:39,142
Didn't you hear me?

1699
01:45:39,182 --> 01:45:42,011
Mother, why don't you speak to me?
Answer me.

1700
01:45:42,022 --> 01:45:43,422
Tell me you forgive me.

1701
01:45:43,477 --> 01:45:47,777
Orin. After all that's happened
are you becoming her cry baby again?

1702
01:45:47,784 --> 01:45:49,211
Mother, please.

1703
01:45:49,222 --> 01:45:50,460
Leave her alone.

1704
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:53,550
Go in the house.

1705
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:56,436
Do you hear me?

1706
01:45:56,446 --> 01:45:58,736
March!
Yes, sir.

1707
01:46:09,157 --> 01:46:12,127
Why are the shutters still closed?
Father's gone.

1708
01:46:13,383 --> 01:46:15,200
They ought to let in the moonlight.

1709
01:46:28,511 --> 01:46:30,411
You know it was justice.

1710
01:46:30,934 --> 01:46:33,664
It was the only true way justice
could be done.

1711
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:37,110
He paid the just penalty for his crime.

1712
01:46:51,627 --> 01:46:52,727
Mother.

1713
01:46:53,834 --> 01:46:55,104
What are you going to do?

1714
01:46:55,614 --> 01:46:57,014
You can live.

1715
01:46:57,038 --> 01:46:59,200
Live?

1716
01:47:16,007 --> 01:47:17,807
It is justice.

1717
01:47:26,307 --> 01:47:27,900
It is justice.

1718
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:29,800
It's your justice, Father.

1719
01:47:31,814 --> 01:47:32,814
Mother!

1720
01:47:34,326 --> 01:47:35,326
Mother!

1721
01:47:37,746 --> 01:47:38,746
Mother!

1722
01:47:46,593 --> 01:47:47,593
Vinnie!

1723
01:47:47,966 --> 01:47:51,321
She had Father's pistol.
Get a doctor.

1724
01:47:51,332 --> 01:47:54,600
Orin!
No, it's too late. She's dead.

1725
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:56,820
Why, why did she, Vinnie?

1726
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,013
I drove her to it.

1727
01:47:59,326 --> 01:48:02,056
She couldn't forgive me.
Why did I boast of killing him, why?

1728
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:03,130
Be quiet.

1729
01:48:03,050 --> 01:48:04,970
Why didn't I let her believe
the burglars killed him?

1730
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:06,205
Then she would've forgiven me.

1731
01:48:06,215 --> 01:48:08,801
Then she would have turned from him
and turned to me...

1732
01:48:09,111 --> 01:48:11,821
I murdered her.
Shhh. Be quiet, Orin.

1733
01:48:11,839 --> 01:48:13,939
I've got to find her.

1734
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,280
I've got to make her forgive me.

1735
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:25,000
Orin...

1736
01:48:25,631 --> 01:48:27,880
You still have me, haven't you?

1737
01:48:27,999 --> 01:48:29,720
I love you.

1738
01:48:29,732 --> 01:48:31,660
I'll take you away.

1739
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:33,370
I'll help you forget, Orin.

1740
01:48:55,992 --> 01:48:57,322
Say, Vinnie.

1741
01:48:57,337 --> 01:48:59,317
Did you hear a gun go off?

1742
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:02,740
I want you to go for Dr. Blake.

1743
01:49:03,956 --> 01:49:05,900
Tell him that Mother has killed herself

1744
01:49:05,912 --> 01:49:08,500
in a fit of insane grief over
Father's death.

1745
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,930
Will you remember to tell him that?

1746
01:49:13,145 --> 01:49:17,088
Ayeh, I'll tell him.

1747
01:49:17,098 --> 01:49:19,033
Anything you say, Vinnie.

1748
01:50:14,944 --> 01:50:15,944
Orin.

1749
01:50:19,072 --> 01:50:20,510
Orin, we're home.

1750
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:34,050
Seth. You can bring our things up
after you've put up the horses.

1751
01:50:34,075 --> 01:50:35,075
Ayeh.

1752
01:50:48,789 --> 01:50:50,559
What are you afraid of, Orin?

1753
01:50:50,576 --> 01:50:54,266
This is the test.
You've got to face it, Orin.

1754
01:50:55,585 --> 01:50:57,545
Hazel and Peter are waiting inside.

1755
01:50:58,453 --> 01:51:00,153
Don't you want to see Hazel?

1756
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:02,330
Why don't you look at the house?

1757
01:51:03,647 --> 01:51:04,647
Orin.

1758
01:51:05,243 --> 01:51:06,600
I want you to look at it now.

1759
01:51:06,603 --> 01:51:07,970
Do you hear me?

1760
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:17,300
Well.

1761
01:51:17,316 --> 01:51:19,726
You don't see any ghosts, do you?

1762
01:51:22,132 --> 01:51:23,132
No.

1763
01:51:24,502 --> 01:51:26,172
Let's go in.

1764
01:51:31,188 --> 01:51:34,838
It was here she...
the last time I saw her alive.

1765
01:51:34,856 --> 01:51:36,616
That's all passed and finished.

1766
01:52:26,024 --> 01:52:28,324
Why do you look at me like that?

1767
01:52:28,691 --> 01:52:30,941
I've done my duty to you.

1768
01:52:31,428 --> 01:52:33,258
That's finished and forgotten.

1769
01:53:19,276 --> 01:53:20,276
Mother!

1770
01:53:21,444 --> 01:53:23,234
Mo... What...

1771
01:53:23,844 --> 01:53:24,844
Orin.

1772
01:53:25,444 --> 01:53:27,334
Orin, what is it?

1773
01:53:28,253 --> 01:53:29,900
She's not here.

1774
01:53:29,919 --> 01:53:31,869
She's not anywhere.

1775
01:53:32,471 --> 01:53:34,541
Orin, will you be quiet.

1776
01:53:34,553 --> 01:53:37,550
Well, let her go, then.
I'm not her son any more.

1777
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:39,960
I'm Father's. I'm a Mannon.

1778
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,536
Stop it. Do you hear me?

1779
01:53:43,547 --> 01:53:45,347
Don't be angry, Vinnie.

1780
01:53:45,862 --> 01:53:47,700
I'm not angry, dear.

1781
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:50,000
But do get hold of yourself.

1782
01:53:51,587 --> 01:53:54,117
You frighten me
when you act so strangely.

1783
01:53:57,006 --> 01:53:59,500
I want to talk to you
before we see Peter and Hazel.

1784
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,252
Won't you be happy to see Hazel
again?

1785
01:54:03,269 --> 01:54:06,339
Their friendship and love will help us
more than anything to forget.

1786
01:54:07,002 --> 01:54:08,003
Forget?

1787
01:54:08,624 --> 01:54:11,224
I thought you'd forgotten long ago,
if you ever remembered.

1788
01:54:11,237 --> 01:54:15,727
Love. What right have I or you
to love?

1789
01:54:15,735 --> 01:54:17,805
Every right.

1790
01:54:17,832 --> 01:54:21,030
Mother felt the same about him.

1791
01:54:22,050 --> 01:54:24,750
You've no idea how like Mother
you've become, Vinnie.

1792
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:26,583
I mean the change in your soul.

1793
01:54:26,591 --> 01:54:29,131
I've watched it ever since we sailed
for the East.

1794
01:54:29,143 --> 01:54:33,000
It's as if her death had set you free to...

1795
01:54:33,421 --> 01:54:35,221
to become her.

1796
01:54:36,537 --> 01:54:38,217
What's come over you, Orin?

1797
01:54:38,224 --> 01:54:41,264
You haven't had one of these
morbid spells since we left the islands.

1798
01:54:41,295 --> 01:54:45,065
I had to get you away from the islands.
My brotherly duty.

1799
01:54:45,088 --> 01:54:47,668
If we had stayed there much longer...
I don't know what you're talking about.

1800
01:54:47,673 --> 01:54:49,833
I only went there for your sake.
Yes...

1801
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:50,800
But afterwards...

1802
01:54:50,842 --> 01:54:53,152
You promised me you weren't going to talk
any more morbid nonsense.

1803
01:54:53,366 --> 01:54:54,926
Come sit down.

1804
01:54:58,634 --> 01:55:01,700
I want you to start again by facing
all your ghosts

1805
01:55:01,712 --> 01:55:04,100
so that you can rid yourself
of your silly guilt.

1806
01:55:05,405 --> 01:55:07,200
Who murdered Father?

1807
01:55:08,401 --> 01:55:10,001
Brant did, for revenge.

1808
01:55:10,128 --> 01:55:11,500
Who murdered father?

1809
01:55:12,801 --> 01:55:13,910
Answer me.

1810
01:55:14,628 --> 01:55:16,800
Mother was under his influence.
That's a lie.

1811
01:55:17,206 --> 01:55:19,566
It was he who was under hers.

1812
01:55:19,578 --> 01:55:22,428
She betrayed Father and murdered him,
didn't she?

1813
01:55:24,034 --> 01:55:25,034
Yes.

1814
01:55:25,178 --> 01:55:26,918
And if we'd done our duty, under the law

1815
01:55:26,921 --> 01:55:28,661
she would have been hanged, wouldn't she?

1816
01:55:30,874 --> 01:55:32,370
Yes.
But we protected her.

1817
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:35,560
She could have lived
but she chose to kill herself.

1818
01:55:35,589 --> 01:55:37,639
It was an act of justice.

1819
01:55:37,845 --> 01:55:40,155
You had nothing to do with it.

1820
01:55:40,372 --> 01:55:42,100
You see that now, don't you?

1821
01:55:44,392 --> 01:55:45,472
Tell me.

1822
01:55:47,008 --> 01:55:48,118
Yes.

1823
01:55:48,128 --> 01:55:52,011
And your feeling of being responsible
for her death
was only your morbid imagination.

1824
01:55:52,324 --> 01:55:53,974
You don't feel it now.

1825
01:55:53,986 --> 01:55:55,556
You'll never feel it again.

1826
01:55:57,063 --> 01:55:58,183
No.

1827
01:55:58,290 --> 01:55:59,390
There.

1828
01:56:00,784 --> 01:56:03,900
There, you see you can do it
when you make up your mind to.

1829
01:56:07,482 --> 01:56:08,722
Now, don't cry.

1830
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:11,020
You ought to feel proud.

1831
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,800
You've proven that you can laugh
at all your ghosts from now on.

1832
01:56:17,444 --> 01:56:18,744
Shhh. Someone's coming, Orin.

1833
01:56:20,293 --> 01:56:24,413
Well. We might as well
begin making ourselves useful.

1834
01:56:26,324 --> 01:56:27,544
Vinnie.

1835
01:56:29,761 --> 01:56:30,761
Peter.

1836
01:56:32,148 --> 01:56:34,428
You've grown so like your...

1837
01:56:36,136 --> 01:56:38,300
Gosh, you look wonderful, Vinnie.

1838
01:56:39,505 --> 01:56:41,355
Gee, but you've changed.

1839
01:56:42,163 --> 01:56:44,833
You haven't gone and changed,
have you?

1840
01:56:45,251 --> 01:56:47,741
You ought to know I'd never change...

1841
01:56:47,756 --> 01:56:48,876
with you.

1842
01:56:49,585 --> 01:56:52,290
You haven't said you're glad to see me.

1843
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:55,670
Well I...
You know how much I...

1844
01:56:56,485 --> 01:56:58,765
Vinnie, you look so darned pretty and...

1845
01:56:58,999 --> 01:57:00,800
and healthy.

1846
01:57:00,804 --> 01:57:03,145
Your trip certainly did you good.

1847
01:57:03,155 --> 01:57:05,600
I used to be an awful old stick,
didn't I?

1848
01:57:05,613 --> 01:57:07,613
Who said so? You were not, but...

1849
01:57:07,827 --> 01:57:10,057
you just didn't use to...

1850
01:57:10,076 --> 01:57:11,636
dress like that and...

1851
01:57:11,644 --> 01:57:14,200
I was dead then.

1852
01:57:16,905 --> 01:57:19,005
Oh, Orin, I didn't see you.
How are you?

1853
01:57:19,025 --> 01:57:22,125
Orin, didn't you hear Peter?
Don't be rude.

1854
01:57:22,256 --> 01:57:23,966
Oh, give him a chance.

1855
01:57:23,971 --> 01:57:25,861
I'm darned glad to have you back,
Orin.

1856
01:57:25,875 --> 01:57:27,200
Thanks, Peter.

1857
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:30,230
Vinnie's still the same
bossy old fuss-buzzer, isn't she?

1858
01:57:30,243 --> 01:57:31,973
Always trying to teach me manners.

1859
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:33,610
Say, hasn't she changed, though?

1860
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:35,720
I hardly know her.

1861
01:57:36,297 --> 01:57:38,147
Maybe it's that dress.

1862
01:57:38,157 --> 01:57:40,647
Ask her why she gets herself up
like Mother.

1863
01:57:40,993 --> 01:57:43,253
I can't see why...

1864
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:44,280
yet

1865
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:46,440
And I don't think she knows herself,
but...

1866
01:57:46,450 --> 01:57:50,760
it'll prove to be a strange reason,
I'm certain of that when I do discover it.

1867
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,520
Don't mind him, Peter.

1868
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:56,187
She's grown romantic, too, imagine that.

1869
01:57:57,297 --> 01:57:59,447
Influence of the islands, eh, Vinnie?

1870
01:58:00,122 --> 01:58:02,382
They turned out to be her islands,
not mine.

1871
01:58:03,493 --> 01:58:06,753
I guess I'm too much of a Mannon
to turn into a pagan, after all.

1872
01:58:06,991 --> 01:58:10,111
But you should have seen Vinnie
with the men.

1873
01:58:10,216 --> 01:58:12,300
Orin, how can you?

1874
01:58:12,304 --> 01:58:15,234
Handsome and romantic-looking,
weren't they, Vinnie?

1875
01:58:15,248 --> 01:58:18,448
Especially the fellow they called
Avahanni.

1876
01:58:18,464 --> 01:58:21,624
Oh... she fell in love with the islanders.

1877
01:58:21,633 --> 01:58:23,543
I was afraid that if we stayed there
much longer

1878
01:58:23,556 --> 01:58:27,406
I'd find her dancing in the moonlight
under the palm trees as naked as the rest.

1879
01:58:27,428 --> 01:58:28,988
Orin, don't be disgusting.

1880
01:58:29,296 --> 01:58:31,356
I wasn't as blind as I pretended to be.

1881
01:58:31,367 --> 01:58:33,500
You don't deny that Avahanni fell in love
with you, do you?

1882
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:34,933
Stop talking like a fool.

1883
01:58:34,944 --> 01:58:39,366
What will Peter think?
He knows you're only teasing, but...

1884
01:58:39,377 --> 01:58:40,937
you shouldn't go on that way.

1885
01:58:40,947 --> 01:58:44,000
Why don't you go and find Hazel?
Here now, let me have a look at you.

1886
01:58:45,208 --> 01:58:47,080
Oh, don't stand like a ramrod.

1887
01:58:47,096 --> 01:58:49,376
You'd really be very handsome if you
shaved off that silly beard

1888
01:58:49,386 --> 01:58:51,500
and didn't carry yourself like a tin soldier.

1889
01:58:51,514 --> 01:58:53,711
Not so much like Father, eh?

1890
01:58:53,727 --> 01:58:56,711
More like a romantic clipper captain,
is that it?

1891
01:58:57,428 --> 01:58:58,878
That's enough of that.

1892
01:59:00,004 --> 01:59:01,700
Now run along and find Hazel.

1893
01:59:01,727 --> 01:59:04,177
She's probably waiting for you,
too shy to come and look for you.

1894
01:59:04,186 --> 01:59:06,400
You seem mighty anxious
to get rid of me.

1895
01:59:12,008 --> 01:59:13,808
What's come over him?

1896
01:59:15,022 --> 01:59:16,122
He's sick, Peter.

1897
01:59:16,195 --> 01:59:19,525
It's what the war did to him.
and Father's death and on top of that...

1898
01:59:19,534 --> 01:59:21,114
Mother's suicide.

1899
01:59:21,126 --> 01:59:22,900
It'll be all right, Vinnie.
Don't you worry.

1900
01:59:22,905 --> 01:59:24,280
Do you still love me?

1901
01:59:25,002 --> 01:59:27,222
I was afraid you didn't love me.

1902
01:59:27,234 --> 01:59:28,810
Oh, I do.

1903
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:30,900
I've thought of you so much.

1904
01:59:30,909 --> 01:59:33,749
Things were always reminding me
of you.

1905
01:59:33,751 --> 01:59:37,151
The ship and the sea,
everything that was honest and clean.

1906
01:59:37,174 --> 01:59:39,744
Even the natives on the island.

1907
01:59:42,558 --> 01:59:45,300
Gosh, you certainly have changed.

1908
01:59:46,115 --> 01:59:49,200
But, say, what about that native
Orin talked about, that er...

1909
01:59:49,208 --> 01:59:50,559
what's his name?

1910
01:59:50,567 --> 01:59:52,500
Avahanni?
Yes.

1911
01:59:52,514 --> 01:59:55,284
He made me think of you, that's it.

1912
01:59:55,291 --> 01:59:58,200
He made me dream of marrying you
and everything.

1913
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:02,636
Oh, I loved those islands.

1914
02:00:02,648 --> 02:00:04,628
They set me free.

1915
02:00:04,634 --> 02:00:08,014
There was something mysterious and
and beautiful there.

1916
02:00:09,506 --> 02:00:12,500
Good spirits coming out of the land
and the sea.

1917
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:14,790
They made me forget death.

1918
02:00:14,804 --> 02:00:17,774
There was only this world,
the wind and the surf,

1919
02:00:17,796 --> 02:00:20,100
the natives dancing innocent and free.

1920
02:00:20,109 --> 02:00:22,339
Without knowledge of sin.

1921
02:00:23,999 --> 02:00:26,049
Oh, but I'm gabbing like a chatterbox.

1922
02:00:26,056 --> 02:00:27,750
I like you this way.

1923
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,800
You never used to say a word
unless you had to.

1924
02:00:30,917 --> 02:00:32,787
Hold me close to you.

1925
02:00:32,796 --> 02:00:35,656
I want to feel love.
Love is all beautiful.

1926
02:00:40,069 --> 02:00:41,589
We'll be married soon, won't we?

1927
02:00:41,593 --> 02:00:44,453
And live out in the country
away from people and their evil talk.

1928
02:00:44,474 --> 02:00:47,774
We'll make an island for ourselves on land
and have children and love them

1929
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:51,009
and teach them to love life so they'll
never be possessed by hate and death.

1930
02:00:51,019 --> 02:00:52,650
Oh, bless you, Peter.

1931
02:00:56,687 --> 02:00:58,400
I'm afraid we're not wanted, Orin.

1932
02:00:58,413 --> 02:01:00,703
So, that's your game, by God!

1933
02:01:01,835 --> 02:01:02,835
Well.

1934
02:01:05,568 --> 02:01:07,758
Don't look so solemn, fuss-buzzer.

1935
02:01:07,768 --> 02:01:10,100
I was only trying to scare you...

1936
02:01:10,104 --> 02:01:11,364
for a joke.

1937
02:01:13,475 --> 02:01:16,465
I suppose congratulations are in order.

1938
02:01:48,098 --> 02:01:52,128
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

1939
02:01:53,036 --> 02:01:54,886
Is that what you're demanding, Father?

1940
02:01:55,396 --> 02:01:57,556
You sure you want the whole truth?

1941
02:01:57,596 --> 02:01:59,916
What will the neighbors say?

1942
02:02:03,226 --> 02:02:05,906
A ticklish decision for you,
Your Honor.

1943
02:02:07,321 --> 02:02:08,321
Orin.

1944
02:02:22,894 --> 02:02:23,894
Orin.

1945
02:02:26,004 --> 02:02:27,680
Orin, please open the door.

1946
02:02:31,147 --> 02:02:33,017
Why did you lock yourself in?

1947
02:02:33,024 --> 02:02:35,654
I was reading Father's law books.

1948
02:02:35,665 --> 02:02:38,285
He wanted me to take up law,
if you remember.

1949
02:02:40,992 --> 02:02:43,577
You've acted very strangely
these last few weeks.

1950
02:02:43,588 --> 02:02:47,158
Locking yourself in here with the
shutters closed.

1951
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:50,688
And the lamp on, even in daytime.

1952
02:02:50,697 --> 02:02:53,477
I hate the daylight.
It's like an accusing eye.

1953
02:02:54,196 --> 02:02:57,846
We've renounced the day,
in which normal people live.

1954
02:02:57,997 --> 02:02:59,660
Or rather, it's renounced us.

1955
02:02:59,664 --> 02:03:01,174
Now you're being stupid again.

1956
02:03:01,184 --> 02:03:04,164
I find artificial light more appropriate
for my work.

1957
02:03:04,175 --> 02:03:06,900
Man's light. Not God's.

1958
02:03:06,918 --> 02:03:10,318
Man's feeble striving to understand
himself.

1959
02:03:10,327 --> 02:03:12,620
To exist for himself in the darkness.

1960
02:03:12,630 --> 02:03:14,900
It's a symbol of his life

1961
02:03:14,916 --> 02:03:20,611
A lamp burning out
in a room of waiting shadows.

1962
02:03:20,622 --> 02:03:24,140
Your work? What work?

1963
02:03:25,450 --> 02:03:28,520
Studying law of crime and punishment.

1964
02:03:30,036 --> 02:03:32,776
All right, if you won't tell me.

1965
02:03:34,005 --> 02:03:36,635
Oh, it's so close in here!
it's suffocating!

1966
02:03:46,547 --> 02:03:48,747
It's black as pitch tonight.

1967
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:51,100
There isn't a star.

1968
02:03:53,304 --> 02:03:56,334
Darkness without a star
to guide us.

1969
02:03:56,769 --> 02:03:58,759
Where are we going, Vinnie?

1970
02:03:58,764 --> 02:04:01,454
Oh, I know you think
you know where you're going, but...

1971
02:04:01,498 --> 02:04:04,358
there's many a slip, remember?

1972
02:04:04,378 --> 02:04:06,544
Be quiet!
Can't you think of anything but...

1973
02:04:08,055 --> 02:04:10,635
I'm sorry.
I'm terribly nervous tonight.

1974
02:04:11,452 --> 02:04:13,342
I'm worried about you, Orin.

1975
02:04:13,359 --> 02:04:15,219
I'm thinking about your health.

1976
02:04:21,425 --> 02:04:24,215
I'm afraid there's not much hope
for you on that score.

1977
02:04:24,223 --> 02:04:26,673
I happen to feel quite well.

1978
02:04:26,696 --> 02:04:29,616
How can you insinuate such horrible...

1979
02:04:31,239 --> 02:04:33,369
But you're only trying to rile me.

1980
02:04:33,394 --> 02:04:35,400
And I'm not going to let you.

1981
02:04:35,403 --> 02:04:37,953
I'm glad you're feeling better.

1982
02:04:37,979 --> 02:04:40,939
The long walk we took with Hazel
must have done you good.

1983
02:04:41,356 --> 02:04:43,876
Why is it you never leave me
alone with her?

1984
02:04:43,886 --> 02:04:47,180
You wanted me to marry her.
Now we're engaged
you never leave us alone for a minute.

1985
02:04:50,293 --> 02:04:54,000
I know the reason.
You're afraid I'll let something slip.

1986
02:04:55,224 --> 02:04:57,444
Can you blame me,
the way you've been acting?

1987
02:04:58,264 --> 02:04:59,264
No.

1988
02:04:59,644 --> 02:05:01,500
I'm afraid myself.

1989
02:05:01,512 --> 02:05:03,642
I've no right in the same world
with her.

1990
02:05:04,256 --> 02:05:07,756
Yet, I feel myself drawn to her purity.

1991
02:05:07,850 --> 02:05:12,370
Her love makes me feel less vile
towards myself.

1992
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,500
And yet at the same time
a million times more vile,

1993
02:05:16,547 --> 02:05:17,960
that's the torment.

1994
02:05:19,162 --> 02:05:21,512
She's another lost island now.

1995
02:05:22,921 --> 02:05:26,051
When I see love for a murderer
in her eyes

1996
02:05:26,064 --> 02:05:32,590
my guilt crowds up in my throat
like poisonous vomit

1997
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:35,677
and I long to spit it out.

1998
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,618
And confess.

1999
02:05:38,634 --> 02:05:41,564
That's what I live in terror of.

2000
02:05:41,576 --> 02:05:43,556
Were you hoping you could escape
retribution?

2001
02:05:44,161 --> 02:05:47,381
Confess and atone to the full extent
of the law.

2002
02:05:47,394 --> 02:05:51,700
That's the only way we can wash
the guilt of our mother's blood
from our souls.

2003
02:05:51,708 --> 02:05:52,978
Will you stop!

2004
02:05:52,983 --> 02:05:55,383
Ask our father, the judge.

2005
02:05:55,393 --> 02:05:57,923
He knows.
Over and over and over.

2006
02:05:57,935 --> 02:06:00,575
Will you never lose your stupid
guilty conscience?

2007
02:06:00,593 --> 02:06:03,953
How can you love that vile woman so?

2008
02:06:03,970 --> 02:06:06,140
When you know all she wanted
was to leave you without a thought
and marry that...

2009
02:06:06,156 --> 02:06:10,500
Yes! Exactly as you were planning
to leave me now and marry Peter.

2010
02:06:10,784 --> 02:06:13,822
I bet you'll stop your tricks
when you know what I've been writing.

2011
02:06:14,563 --> 02:06:16,190
What have you written?

2012
02:06:16,698 --> 02:06:18,500
That frightens you, does it?

2013
02:06:18,533 --> 02:06:19,763
I've got to know.

2014
02:06:22,172 --> 02:06:24,500
Well, I suppose I might as well tell you.

2015
02:06:25,834 --> 02:06:30,134
At his earnest solicitation,
as the last male Mannon -

2016
02:06:30,149 --> 02:06:31,922
thank heaven for that, eh! -

2017
02:06:32,732 --> 02:06:35,550
I've been writing the history
of our family.

2018
02:06:36,256 --> 02:06:37,420
What kind of history?

2019
02:06:37,429 --> 02:06:40,276
The true history of the family crimes.

2020
02:06:40,286 --> 02:06:44,402
Beginning with grandfather Abe,
all of the crimes including ours.

2021
02:06:44,416 --> 02:06:47,762
I've tried to trace to its secret
hiding place

2022
02:06:47,772 --> 02:06:51,400
the evil destiny behind our lives.

2023
02:06:51,403 --> 02:06:54,297
If I can find it clearly in our past,
I may be able to foretell

2024
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:56,527
what fate is in store for us, Vinnie.

2025
02:06:56,543 --> 02:06:59,700
But I haven't dared predict that.
Not yet.

2026
02:07:00,085 --> 02:07:03,380
But I can guess.
Orin.

2027
02:07:05,393 --> 02:07:10,073
I found you the most interesting
criminal of us all.

2028
02:07:10,097 --> 02:07:12,100
How can you say such
dreadful things?

2029
02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:14,430
You know that behind all that pretense
about Mother's murder

2030
02:07:14,464 --> 02:07:17,128
being an act of justice was your
jealous hatred.

2031
02:07:17,138 --> 02:07:18,762
You wanted Brant for yourself.

2032
02:07:18,770 --> 02:07:20,600
That's a lie! I hated him.

2033
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,669
After you found out he loved Mother,
yes.

2034
02:07:24,071 --> 02:07:26,181
But we'll let that pass

2035
02:07:27,592 --> 02:07:31,588
and come to what I've written
about your adventures on our lost islands.

2036
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:33,210
Or should I say...

2037
02:07:33,716 --> 02:07:35,516
Adam Brant's islands.

2038
02:07:35,686 --> 02:07:38,383
Stop it! I warn you.
I won't bear it much longer.

2039
02:07:38,393 --> 02:07:41,453
Oh, what a paradise
the islands were for you, eh?

2040
02:07:42,664 --> 02:07:46,180
All those handsome men staring at you.

2041
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:50,120
With your strange beautiful hair.

2042
02:07:50,943 --> 02:07:52,903
That was when you finally
became pretty.

2043
02:07:52,992 --> 02:07:54,202
Like Mother.

2044
02:07:54,258 --> 02:07:57,738
You knew that they all desired you,
didn't you?
They filled you with pride.

2045
02:07:57,747 --> 02:07:59,880
Especially Avahanni.
And you wanted him.

2046
02:07:59,888 --> 02:08:01,120
No!
Don't lie.

2047
02:08:01,128 --> 02:08:03,780
What did you do when you stepped away
with him that night when I was sick?

2048
02:08:04,747 --> 02:08:06,760
I kissed him good night, that's all.

2049
02:08:06,970 --> 02:08:08,730
In gratitude.

2050
02:08:08,747 --> 02:08:10,517
So you kissed him.

2051
02:08:10,523 --> 02:08:11,823
And that's all.

2052
02:08:11,835 --> 02:08:15,180
And what if it wasn't?
You vile, common...

2053
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:16,200
I'll kill you and...

2054
02:08:16,308 --> 02:08:19,188
No, but you're lying, aren't you?

2055
02:08:19,196 --> 02:08:22,556
Tell me you're lying, Vinnie.
Yes, yes, it was a lie.

2056
02:08:22,561 --> 02:08:24,431
How could you believe I...

2057
02:08:24,449 --> 02:08:26,060
Oh, Orin.

2058
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:28,750
Something made me tell you that
against my will.

2059
02:08:28,762 --> 02:08:31,002
Something rose up in me
like an evil spirit.

2060
02:08:35,717 --> 02:08:37,537
Ghosts.

2061
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:40,400
You never seemed so much like Mother
as you did just then.

2062
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:42,100
Oh, no, don't talk about it.

2063
02:08:42,113 --> 02:08:44,046
Let's forget it ever happened.

2064
02:08:44,056 --> 02:08:45,300
Forgive me.

2065
02:08:45,304 --> 02:08:46,830
Please forget it, Orin.

2066
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:48,770
All right.

2067
02:08:48,785 --> 02:08:50,575
If the ghosts will let us forget.

2068
02:08:52,082 --> 02:08:53,900
I believe you about Avahanni.

2069
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,550
But you were guilty in your mind
just the same.

2070
02:08:57,568 --> 02:08:59,070
Stop torturing me.

2071
02:08:59,229 --> 02:09:01,879
I've warned you. I warn you again.

2072
02:09:01,881 --> 02:09:04,531
I can't bear it much more.
I won't.

2073
02:09:04,581 --> 02:09:06,451
Then why don't you murder me?

2074
02:09:06,543 --> 02:09:08,773
I'd help you plan it just as we
planned Brant's

2075
02:09:08,799 --> 02:09:10,339
so there'd be no suspicion on you.

2076
02:09:11,076 --> 02:09:13,400
I loathe my life.
Orin!

2077
02:09:13,405 --> 02:09:16,285
Don't you see?
I'm now in Father's place.

2078
02:09:16,295 --> 02:09:17,600
You are Mother.

2079
02:09:18,708 --> 02:09:23,113
That's the evil destiny out of the past
that I hadn't dared predict.

2080
02:09:23,123 --> 02:09:25,253
I'm the Mannon you're chained to.

2081
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:28,134
Won't you be quiet, for heaven's sake!

2082
02:09:29,554 --> 02:09:32,471
Take care, Orin.
You'll be responsible if...

2083
02:09:32,891 --> 02:09:33,961
If what?

2084
02:09:33,979 --> 02:09:37,359
If I should die mysteriously
of heart failure?

2085
02:09:37,371 --> 02:09:39,741
Leave me alone.
How can you be so horrible?

2086
02:09:39,763 --> 02:09:41,863
Don't you know I'm your sister
who loves you?

2087
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:43,383
Who'd give her life to bring you
peace?

2088
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:45,191
I don't believe you.
I know you're plotting something.

2089
02:09:45,201 --> 02:09:48,643
But I warn you. I won't stand
your leaving me for Peter.

2090
02:09:48,663 --> 02:09:51,840
And if I should die...
Oh, stop having such thoughts.

2091
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,300
You're like a devil towards me.

2092
02:09:55,514 --> 02:09:57,300
I won't listen.

2093
02:09:57,318 --> 02:09:58,958
I won't.

2094
02:10:00,049 --> 02:10:01,619
Don't cry.

2095
02:10:01,626 --> 02:10:04,616
The damned don't cry.

2096
02:10:06,325 --> 02:10:07,655
Go away.

2097
02:10:07,665 --> 02:10:09,200
I want to be alone.

2098
02:10:09,208 --> 02:10:11,566
Finish my work.

2099
02:10:33,277 --> 02:10:36,500
Oh, why does he keep putting
his death in my head?

2100
02:10:37,606 --> 02:10:39,600
He'd be better off if he were dead.

2101
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:43,300
Why hasn't he the courage to...

2102
02:10:48,011 --> 02:10:49,931
Don't let me have such thoughts.

2103
02:10:50,544 --> 02:10:52,164
You know I love Orin.

2104
02:10:52,186 --> 02:10:54,400
Show me the way to save him.

2105
02:10:54,411 --> 02:10:57,041
Please, please.

2106
02:10:59,003 --> 02:11:01,373
Vinnie! Oh, Vinnie!

2107
02:11:07,292 --> 02:11:08,600
Oh, Vinnie.

2108
02:11:08,604 --> 02:11:11,474
Yes?
That darned idiot of a cook
is throwing fits again.

2109
02:11:11,492 --> 02:11:15,404
Went down the cellar and said
she felt ghosts creeping behind her.

2110
02:11:15,414 --> 02:11:18,012
You better come and get her
calmed down

2111
02:11:18,027 --> 02:11:19,443
or she'll be leavin'.

2112
02:11:21,253 --> 02:11:22,483
I'll talk to her.

2113
02:11:33,101 --> 02:11:35,601
See who it is, Seth.
Ayeh.

2114
02:11:42,696 --> 02:11:44,626
Hazel, Peter.
Hello, Seth.

2115
02:11:44,637 --> 02:11:47,218
Is Vinnie here?
Ayeh.

2116
02:11:49,228 --> 02:11:51,528
You can just wait in the settin' room.

2117
02:11:54,727 --> 02:11:57,022
You set down and I'll tell her
you're here.

2118
02:11:57,032 --> 02:11:58,899
She'll come as soon as she kin.

2119
02:12:02,477 --> 02:12:05,287
I'll just say hello to Vinnie
then run along to the Council meeting.

2120
02:12:06,692 --> 02:12:09,762
I hate this house now.
Oh, sit down.

2121
02:12:12,076 --> 02:12:13,677
I hate coming here.

2122
02:12:13,688 --> 02:12:16,011
If it wasn't for Orin, I...

2123
02:12:17,133 --> 02:12:19,183
Why does Vinnie keep him
shut up here?

2124
02:12:19,192 --> 02:12:22,772
Oh, so that's what you've got
against her, huh?

2125
02:12:22,795 --> 02:12:24,070
Don't be silly.

2126
02:12:24,084 --> 02:12:27,564
I simply think and I'd say it to her face
that she's a bad influence for Orin.

2127
02:12:28,522 --> 02:12:30,700
He scares me at times.

2128
02:12:32,017 --> 02:12:33,277
And Vinnie...

2129
02:12:34,492 --> 02:12:36,590
I've watched her looking at you.

2130
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:38,710
There's something bold about her.

2131
02:12:38,726 --> 02:12:40,755
Look, if you're going to talk
like that...

2132
02:12:41,766 --> 02:12:43,650
You ought to be ashamed, Hazel.

2133
02:12:43,660 --> 02:12:45,122
Well, I'm not.

2134
02:12:46,132 --> 02:12:48,552
And I'm going to make her let him
visit us.

2135
02:12:48,564 --> 02:12:52,054
Well, I think it's a darned good notion.
She needs a rest from him, too.

2136
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:53,920
Vinnie doesn't think it's a good notion.

2137
02:12:53,940 --> 02:12:56,350
But I'm going to make Orin promise to...

2138
02:12:56,372 --> 02:12:58,572
to come over tomorrow
no matter what she says.

2139
02:12:58,593 --> 02:13:01,005
Don't get angry now over nothing.

2140
02:13:01,025 --> 02:13:03,030
I'll help you get your way with Vinnie.

2141
02:13:03,556 --> 02:13:05,966
Gosh, I'll do anything to help you
get Orin well.

2142
02:13:06,578 --> 02:13:09,828
As long as Vinnie's tied down to him
we can't get married.

2143
02:13:11,037 --> 02:13:13,817
Do you really want to marry her now?

2144
02:13:13,832 --> 02:13:16,477
Why do you ask such a fool question?

2145
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,041
I don't know, Peter.

2146
02:13:21,053 --> 02:13:23,171
What in the dickens
is the matter with you, Hazel?

2147
02:13:23,181 --> 02:13:26,377
Here, what are you crying for?

2148
02:13:35,288 --> 02:13:36,628
Hello, Orin.

2149
02:13:37,648 --> 02:13:39,028
Where's Vinnie?

2150
02:13:39,081 --> 02:13:40,490
Seth went to call her.

2151
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:46,450
I've got to talk to Hazel alone.

2152
02:13:46,968 --> 02:13:49,811
All right.
You don't have to put me out.

2153
02:13:49,822 --> 02:13:52,412
Tell Vinnie I had to go along,
but I'll come straight back.

2154
02:13:52,424 --> 02:13:54,038
I won't be long.

2155
02:14:02,583 --> 02:14:04,223
Listen, Hazel...

2156
02:14:05,934 --> 02:14:07,454
I want you to do something.

2157
02:14:09,221 --> 02:14:10,511
Take this.

2158
02:14:10,524 --> 02:14:12,254
Don't let her see it.

2159
02:14:12,268 --> 02:14:16,000
I want you to put it in a safe place
and never let anyone know you have it.

2160
02:14:16,017 --> 02:14:17,760
What is it, Orin?
You mustn't ask me.

2161
02:14:17,770 --> 02:14:19,910
And you must promise
never to open it

2162
02:14:19,924 --> 02:14:21,944
unless something happens to me.

2163
02:14:21,964 --> 02:14:23,157
What do you mean?

2164
02:14:23,167 --> 02:14:25,326
I mean, if I should die.

2165
02:14:25,336 --> 02:14:26,336
Orin.

2166
02:14:26,991 --> 02:14:29,900
Or, if she tries to marry Peter,

2167
02:14:29,909 --> 02:14:33,591
the day before the wedding
I want you to make Peter read
what's inside it.

2168
02:14:33,601 --> 02:14:36,152
You don't want her to marry Peter?
No.

2169
02:14:36,162 --> 02:14:39,272
She can't have happiness.
She's got to be punished.

2170
02:14:40,001 --> 02:14:41,000
And...

2171
02:14:42,175 --> 02:14:45,215
Hazel, you mustn't love me any more.

2172
02:14:45,232 --> 02:14:50,482
No! The only love I can know now
is the love of guilt for guilt.

2173
02:14:50,494 --> 02:14:52,500
Which breeds more guilt.

2174
02:14:52,503 --> 02:14:55,963
Until you get so deep in the bottom
of hell that...

2175
02:14:55,981 --> 02:14:58,151
there's no lower you can sink.

2176
02:15:00,114 --> 02:15:02,130
And you rest there in peace.

2177
02:15:02,147 --> 02:15:04,177
Orin, don't talk like that.

2178
02:15:04,188 --> 02:15:06,219
I know something's worrying you.

2179
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:08,652
I've had such a strong feeling that...

2180
02:15:08,662 --> 02:15:11,200
it would relieve your mind
if you could tell me what it is.

2181
02:15:14,202 --> 02:15:15,202
Yes...

2182
02:15:15,530 --> 02:15:18,150
Yes, I want to be forgiven.

2183
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:19,750
I want to confess.

2184
02:15:21,864 --> 02:15:23,966
No, I can't. Don't ask me.

2185
02:15:24,577 --> 02:15:28,427
Orin, Vinnie told Peter herself
what it is.

2186
02:15:29,999 --> 02:15:31,511
What did she tell?

2187
02:15:33,152 --> 02:15:37,200
About how you quarreled with
your poor mother the night before she...

2188
02:15:38,317 --> 02:15:40,727
and how you've brooded over it until...

2189
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:42,720
you blame yourself for her death.

2190
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:46,830
I see... So in case I did tell you...

2191
02:15:46,854 --> 02:15:49,274
Oh, she's cunning.

2192
02:15:49,295 --> 02:15:51,745
But not cunning enough this time.

2193
02:15:51,753 --> 02:15:54,663
Remember what I gave you
and do exactly what I said with it.

2194
02:15:56,598 --> 02:15:58,098
Oh, Hazel...

2195
02:15:58,375 --> 02:16:02,335
If you love me help me get away
from here
or something terrible will happen.

2196
02:16:02,345 --> 02:16:04,065
That's just what I want to do.

2197
02:16:04,083 --> 02:16:06,443
You come over tomorrow
and stay with us.

2198
02:16:06,453 --> 02:16:08,683
Do you suppose for a moment
she'd ever let me go?

2199
02:16:08,694 --> 02:16:10,800
Haven't you a right to do
as you want to?

2200
02:16:11,407 --> 02:16:12,507
Yes.

2201
02:16:14,490 --> 02:16:17,000
I could sneak out when she wasn't watching...

2202
02:16:17,131 --> 02:16:20,551
and then you can hide me and when
she comes for me
you tell her I'm not there.

2203
02:16:20,572 --> 02:16:22,182
I won't do any such thing.

2204
02:16:22,816 --> 02:16:24,700
I don't tell lies, Orin.

2205
02:16:24,714 --> 02:16:26,490
You better get out of here.

2206
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:27,900
Don't let anyone see
what I have given you.

2207
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:29,132
Go home and lock it up.

2208
02:16:29,142 --> 02:16:31,035
Oh, how can you be so scared
of Vinnie?

2209
02:16:31,045 --> 02:16:32,045
Shhh.

2210
02:16:35,628 --> 02:16:36,950
Where's Peter?

2211
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:38,500
Seth said he was here with you.

2212
02:16:38,521 --> 02:16:40,341
He had to go to a Council meeting.

2213
02:16:40,354 --> 02:16:41,450
He'll be right back.

2214
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:44,000
Has he been gone long?

2215
02:16:44,005 --> 02:16:45,345
Not very long.

2216
02:16:46,684 --> 02:16:49,655
My, but you two look mysterious.

2217
02:16:49,666 --> 02:16:52,083
Why, Vinnie, what makes you think...
You're hiding something.

2218
02:16:53,193 --> 02:16:55,730
Hazel's invited me over to their house.

2219
02:16:55,740 --> 02:16:57,450
And I'm going.

2220
02:16:57,461 --> 02:16:58,853
He's coming tomorrow.

2221
02:16:58,863 --> 02:17:00,523
It's kind of you.

2222
02:17:00,544 --> 02:17:01,730
But he can't go.

2223
02:17:01,738 --> 02:17:02,850
Why not?

2224
02:17:02,999 --> 02:17:05,000
I don't wish to discuss it.

2225
02:17:05,013 --> 02:17:07,754
Orin's of age.
He can go where he pleases.

2226
02:17:07,768 --> 02:17:09,509
I'll ask you to please mind
your own business.

2227
02:17:09,516 --> 02:17:12,600
It is my business. I love Orin.

2228
02:17:12,607 --> 02:17:15,401
I don't think you love him at all
the way you've been acting.

2229
02:17:15,416 --> 02:17:17,701
Hazel, you said you ought
to go home.

2230
02:17:17,714 --> 02:17:21,000
I think you'd better go now
and leave me
to fight this out with Vinnie.

2231
02:17:21,304 --> 02:17:23,191
All right, Orin.

2232
02:17:23,201 --> 02:17:25,821
We'll expect you tomorrow
and have your room ready.

2233
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
After the way you've insulted me,
Vinnie,

2234
02:17:29,022 --> 02:17:32,183
I hope you realize there's no longer
any question of friendship between us.

2235
02:17:32,193 --> 02:17:33,800
What are you hiding behind your back?

2236
02:17:35,202 --> 02:17:36,900
Have you given her what you've written?

2237
02:17:36,917 --> 02:17:37,917
Answer me.

2238
02:17:38,496 --> 02:17:41,082
What if I have?
You traitor, you coward.

2239
02:17:41,092 --> 02:17:43,272
Give it to me. Do you hear?

2240
02:17:43,282 --> 02:17:44,862
Vinnie, how dare you speak to me
that way!

2241
02:17:44,872 --> 02:17:46,562
You shan't leave this house
until you...

2242
02:17:46,571 --> 02:17:49,031
Orin, think what you're doing.

2243
02:17:49,051 --> 02:17:50,841
Tell her to give it to me.
No.

2244
02:17:50,852 --> 02:17:54,052
Think sanely for a moment.  You can't do this.
You're a Mannon.

2245
02:17:54,462 --> 02:17:56,412
It's because I am one.

2246
02:17:56,423 --> 02:17:58,933
For Mother's sake, you can't!
You loved her.

2247
02:17:58,944 --> 02:18:01,944
A lot she cared. Don't call on her.

2248
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:04,855
For my sake, Orin.
You know I love you.

2249
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,820
Make Hazel give it up and
I'll do anything.

2250
02:18:06,827 --> 02:18:08,048
Anything you want me to.

2251
02:18:09,268 --> 02:18:10,828
Do you really mean that?

2252
02:18:10,839 --> 02:18:11,839
Yes.

2253
02:18:14,602 --> 02:18:15,900
Give it to me, Hazel.

2254
02:18:22,926 --> 02:18:26,781
I suppose we can't expect you
tomorrow now.

2255
02:18:26,801 --> 02:18:29,022
No. Forget me.

2256
02:18:29,042 --> 02:18:31,742
The Orin you loved was killed
in the war.

2257
02:18:31,764 --> 02:18:36,091
Remember him, not his rotting ghost.

2258
02:18:37,501 --> 02:18:38,501
Goodbye.

2259
02:18:40,004 --> 02:18:41,264
Please go.

2260
02:18:55,925 --> 02:18:58,965
Do you realize the promise you made
means giving up Peter?

2261
02:18:59,570 --> 02:19:01,640
Yes.
And never seeing him again?

2262
02:19:01,659 --> 02:19:03,400
Yes.

2263
02:19:07,505 --> 02:19:11,600
But how will I make you keep
a promise that I forced out of you?

2264
02:19:11,618 --> 02:19:13,670
Oh, I know you, Vinnie.

2265
02:19:13,773 --> 02:19:15,853
You'll always be plotting
how to break it.

2266
02:19:16,779 --> 02:19:19,279
The only thing in your way now
is my life.

2267
02:19:19,289 --> 02:19:21,389
Orin, don't talk like that.

2268
02:19:21,394 --> 02:19:24,224
You'd do anything now
to get rid of me.

2269
02:19:24,836 --> 02:19:26,900
I said I knew you, but...

2270
02:19:27,102 --> 02:19:28,300
do I?

2271
02:19:29,312 --> 02:19:32,722
There are times when you no longer
seem to be my sister at all.

2272
02:19:32,745 --> 02:19:34,933
Or Mother, but...

2273
02:19:36,044 --> 02:19:38,000
some stranger.

2274
02:19:38,196 --> 02:19:41,300
with the same beautiful hair.

2275
02:19:44,510 --> 02:19:46,400
Perhaps you're Marie Brantôme.

2276
02:19:46,430 --> 02:19:49,211
And you say there are no ghosts in this house.

2277
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,180
Orin!

2278
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:52,900
You're insane.

2279
02:19:55,713 --> 02:19:59,553
Vinnie, there's only one way out
of this hell.

2280
02:19:59,561 --> 02:20:02,761
Let's go now and confess and pay the penalty

2281
02:20:02,735 --> 02:20:05,260
and find peace together.

2282
02:20:05,770 --> 02:20:07,710
Please.

2283
02:20:08,542 --> 02:20:10,712
No, you coward!

2284
02:20:10,728 --> 02:20:12,166
There's nothing to confess.

2285
02:20:12,177 --> 02:20:13,577
There was only justice.

2286
02:20:15,185 --> 02:20:16,515
You hear her?

2287
02:20:16,539 --> 02:20:21,000
You'll find Lavinia Mannon harder
to break than me.

2288
02:20:21,013 --> 02:20:23,768
You'll have to haunt her
and hound her for a lifetime.

2289
02:20:23,778 --> 02:20:25,948
I hate you!
I wish you were dead!

2290
02:20:25,956 --> 02:20:28,999
You have no right to live.
You'd kill yourself if you weren't
a coward.

2291
02:20:29,634 --> 02:20:32,433
Vinnie!
I mean it! I mean it!

2292
02:20:34,249 --> 02:20:36,219
You mean it.

2293
02:20:37,789 --> 02:20:40,339
Another act of justice, eh?

2294
02:20:42,074 --> 02:20:44,804
Only it would be justice now.
You're Mother.

2295
02:20:44,995 --> 02:20:47,945
Yes, she's speaking now,
through you.

2296
02:20:47,958 --> 02:20:51,660
Yes, it's the way to find my island.

2297
02:20:51,670 --> 02:20:53,660
My lost island.

2298
02:20:53,686 --> 02:20:56,906
Death is an island of peace, too.

2299
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:59,100
Mother will be waiting for me.

2300
02:20:59,401 --> 02:21:02,170
Mother, you know what I'll do.

2301
02:21:04,490 --> 02:21:06,510
I'll go down on my kness and...

2302
02:21:07,538 --> 02:21:09,348
ask your forgiveness and say...

2303
02:21:12,665 --> 02:21:13,755
I'll say...

2304
02:21:16,564 --> 02:21:18,911
I'm glad you found love, Mother.

2305
02:21:19,922 --> 02:21:21,755
I'll wish you happiness.

2306
02:21:21,766 --> 02:21:22,966
You and...

2307
02:21:24,481 --> 02:21:26,101
and Adam.

2308
02:21:31,819 --> 02:21:33,119
Mother.

2309
02:21:36,164 --> 02:21:37,444
No, Orin!

2310
02:21:37,457 --> 02:21:40,000
Get out of my way, can't you?
Mother's waiting.

2311
02:21:40,011 --> 02:21:41,011
Orin!

2312
02:21:42,932 --> 02:21:44,882
That's Peter. Shut up, now.

2313
02:21:47,596 --> 02:21:49,316
Hello, Orin.
Hello, Peter.

2314
02:21:51,621 --> 02:21:54,651
Vinnie's just had a quarrel with Hazel.
She's all upset.

2315
02:21:54,668 --> 02:21:56,588
That sister of mine. Where is she?

2316
02:21:56,590 --> 02:21:57,830
Gone home.

2317
02:21:57,847 --> 02:22:00,047
Vinnie, don't you pay any attention
to her.

2318
02:22:00,065 --> 02:22:01,907
You take her in there and comfort her.

2319
02:22:01,947 --> 02:22:04,593
I'll go into the study and clean
my pistol.

2320
02:22:04,603 --> 02:22:06,833
Glad you came back, Peter.

2321
02:22:06,851 --> 02:22:08,661
You can keep Vinnie company.

2322
02:22:14,186 --> 02:22:15,686
Orin!

2323
02:22:16,556 --> 02:22:17,556
Orin!

2324
02:22:17,855 --> 02:22:19,790
He's a darned fool
to monkey with a pistol in his state.

2325
02:22:19,805 --> 02:22:20,883
What's the matter with him?

2326
02:22:20,893 --> 02:22:22,276
Peter!

2327
02:22:22,376 --> 02:22:23,716
Hold me close to you.

2328
02:22:23,728 --> 02:22:25,448
Nothing matters but love, does it?

2329
02:22:25,458 --> 02:22:27,518
No price is too big, is it?

2330
02:22:27,523 --> 02:22:29,410
Oh, I must have peace.

2331
02:22:29,420 --> 02:22:31,100
No one has the right to keep anyone
from peace.

2332
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,770
Shouldn't I get that pistol
away from him?

2333
02:22:32,776 --> 02:22:33,776
Oh, won't it be wonderful?

2334
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:35,591
Once we're married, together in our home
away from here?

2335
02:22:35,601 --> 02:22:37,531
Oh, we'll be so happy.

2336
02:22:37,547 --> 02:22:39,437
I want to be happy, Peter.

2337
02:22:39,443 --> 02:22:41,313
I love everything that grows simply.

2338
02:22:41,323 --> 02:22:43,853
Up toward the sun,
everything that's straight and strong.

2339
02:22:43,861 --> 02:22:48,711
I hate what's dark and warped
and eats into itself and dies for a lifetime
in darkness.

2340
02:22:48,742 --> 02:22:51,442
I can't bear waiting and waiting
and waiting...

2341
02:22:52,604 --> 02:22:53,604
Orin.

2342
02:22:54,857 --> 02:22:55,857
Orin!

2343
02:22:55,917 --> 02:22:56,917
Orin!

2344
02:22:58,136 --> 02:22:59,340
I'll break in through the window.

2345
02:23:03,496 --> 02:23:04,826
Orin...

2346
02:23:04,999 --> 02:23:07,336
forgive me.

2347
02:23:37,322 --> 02:23:39,012
Why do you look at me like that?

2348
02:23:39,023 --> 02:23:41,700
Wasn't it the only way to keep
your secret?

2349
02:23:41,898 --> 02:23:45,133
I'm through with you forever now.

2350
02:23:45,144 --> 02:23:47,744
I'm Mother's daughter,
not one of you.

2351
02:23:47,753 --> 02:23:50,210
I'll live in spite of you!

2352
02:23:50,217 --> 02:23:52,527
Vinnie, did you see?

2353
02:24:16,368 --> 02:24:17,468
Seth.

2354
02:24:17,688 --> 02:24:20,300
Ayeh?
Take these and put them inside.

2355
02:24:20,305 --> 02:24:22,155
I want the house to be filled
with flowers.

2356
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,448
Oh, Vinnie, I, uh...

2357
02:24:41,489 --> 02:24:45,949
I seed you settin' out here on the steps
when I got up at five this mornin'

2358
02:24:45,961 --> 02:24:48,621
and every mornin' since Orin...

2359
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:52,020
Ain't you gettin' no sleep?

2360
02:24:52,051 --> 02:24:58,231
How'd you like if I was to haul one of them
sofas out here for you to lay down on?

2361
02:25:01,262 --> 02:25:03,044
I'm waiting for Peter.

2362
02:25:05,755 --> 02:25:08,915
Why didn't you tell me to go
in the house and lie down?

2363
02:25:09,536 --> 02:25:11,886
You understand, don't you?

2364
02:25:12,191 --> 02:25:16,422
You know there's no rest in this house
that Grandfather
built as a temple of Hate and Death!

2365
02:25:16,444 --> 02:25:21,164
Don't you try to live here, Vinnie!
You marry Peter and git clear!

2366
02:25:21,173 --> 02:25:22,763
I'm going to marry him.

2367
02:25:22,775 --> 02:25:26,000
And I'm going away with him
and forget this house
and everything that's happened here!

2368
02:25:26,055 --> 02:25:28,335
That's talking, Vinnie.

2369
02:25:28,356 --> 02:25:33,000
I'll close it up and leave it in the sun
and rain to die.

2370
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:35,033
The Mannons will be forgotten.

2371
02:25:35,055 --> 02:25:37,955
I'm the last and won't be one for long.

2372
02:25:38,056 --> 02:25:39,800
I'll be Mrs Peter Niles.

2373
02:25:40,948 --> 02:25:42,418
Then they're finished.

2374
02:25:42,427 --> 02:25:43,700
Thank heaven.

2375
02:25:45,416 --> 02:25:46,710
Oh, Vinnie.

2376
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:48,500
Here's Hazel coming.

2377
02:26:12,309 --> 02:26:14,779
It won't take me long to say
what I've come to say, Vinnie.

2378
02:26:15,883 --> 02:26:20,000
It's a lie about Orin
killing himself by accident! I know it is!

2379
02:26:20,881 --> 02:26:23,500
I should think you'd be the last one
to accuse Orin...

2380
02:26:23,512 --> 02:26:26,155
I'm not accusing Orin.
I'm accusing you.

2381
02:26:26,177 --> 02:26:27,680
You drove him to it.

2382
02:26:29,697 --> 02:26:32,447
What would Orin think of you coming here
on the day of his funeral

2383
02:26:32,457 --> 02:26:35,060
to accuse me of the sorrow
that's afflicted our family?

2384
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,550
All right, Vinnie.

2385
02:26:37,561 --> 02:26:39,911
I won't say anything more.

2386
02:26:40,939 --> 02:26:45,059
But I know there's something
- and so do you -
something that was driving Orin crazy.

2387
02:26:46,371 --> 02:26:47,411
Poor Orin.

2388
02:26:50,894 --> 02:26:52,200
Don't do that.

2389
02:26:55,013 --> 02:26:56,400
I'm sorry.

2390
02:26:57,604 --> 02:26:59,600
I didn't come to talk about Orin.

2391
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:01,500
What did you come for?

2392
02:27:01,518 --> 02:27:02,800
About Peter.

2393
02:27:02,845 --> 02:27:04,030
You leave Peter and me alone.

2394
02:27:04,050 --> 02:27:06,630
You're not going to marry Peter
and ruin his life, you can't!

2395
02:27:06,642 --> 02:27:10,522
Don't you see you'll only drag him
into this terrible thing, whatever it is?

2396
02:27:10,544 --> 02:27:12,364
There is no terrible thing.

2397
02:27:12,383 --> 02:27:14,513
Oh, Vinnie, you've got to be fair
to Peter.

2398
02:27:14,536 --> 02:27:16,980
You've got to consider his happiness,
if you really love him!

2399
02:27:16,996 --> 02:27:18,018
I do love him.

2400
02:27:18,028 --> 02:27:19,815
He fought with Mother last night.

2401
02:27:19,825 --> 02:27:21,810
The first time he ever did
such a thing.

2402
02:27:21,826 --> 02:27:23,750
He left home and went to the hotel.

2403
02:27:23,770 --> 02:27:26,560
He said he'd never speak to Mother
or me again.

2404
02:27:27,489 --> 02:27:28,922
You've changed him.

2405
02:27:28,933 --> 02:27:33,710
We've always been so happy before.
It's broken Mother's heart.
All she does is sit and cry.

2406
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:36,550
Oh, Vinnie, you can't do it!

2407
02:27:36,570 --> 02:27:39,900
You will be punished if you do!
Peter will get to hate you in the end!

2408
02:27:40,013 --> 02:27:42,553
No!
Do you want to drive him to do
what Orin did?

2409
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,320
He might, if he ever discovered the truth!

2410
02:27:45,330 --> 02:27:48,710
What truth, you little fool?
I don't know, but you know.

2411
02:27:48,738 --> 02:27:53,120
Look in your heart and ask your conscience
before God if you ought to marry Peter!

2412
02:27:53,140 --> 02:27:55,010
Yes, before God, before anything.

2413
02:27:56,420 --> 02:27:59,880
You leave me alone. Go away
or I'll get Orin's pistol and kill you!

2414
02:27:59,892 --> 02:28:02,110
You are wicked.

2415
02:28:02,116 --> 02:28:04,026
I believe you would.

2416
02:28:04,537 --> 02:28:07,000
Vinnie, what's made you like this?

2417
02:28:07,706 --> 02:28:09,100
Go away.

2418
02:28:09,104 --> 02:28:11,243
All right, I'll go.
But remember one thing.

2419
02:28:11,263 --> 02:28:13,963
You owe it to Peter to let him read
what Orin wrote in that envelope.

2420
02:28:14,184 --> 02:28:16,700
Orin asked me to make him read it
before he married you.

2421
02:28:16,705 --> 02:28:18,433
I've told Peter about that,
Vinnie.

2422
02:28:20,444 --> 02:28:22,234
I know you're suffering.

2423
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:26,216
And I know your conscience
will make you do what's right.

2424
02:28:27,312 --> 02:28:28,930
And God will forgive you.

2425
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:38,000
I'm not asking God or anyone
to forgive me.

2426
02:28:38,117 --> 02:28:39,814
I forgive myself.

2427
02:28:46,424 --> 02:28:49,800
Oh, I hope there's a hell for the
good somewhere.

2428
02:30:05,544 --> 02:30:09,900
The dead... why can't the dead die?

2429
02:30:44,412 --> 02:30:45,412
Vinnie.

2430
02:30:47,852 --> 02:30:49,652
Sit down, Peter.

2431
02:30:53,042 --> 02:30:55,920
Vinnie, you look so terribly worn.
Haven't you slept?

2432
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
We'll be married soon.

2433
02:31:03,049 --> 02:31:05,910
The first thing is to get you away
from this house.

2434
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:06,920
Yes.

2435
02:31:07,333 --> 02:31:09,062
Love can't live in it.

2436
02:31:09,072 --> 02:31:11,820
We'll go away and leave it alone
to die.

2437
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:15,600
And we'll forget the dead.
We can't move too far away
to suit me!

2438
02:31:17,403 --> 02:31:20,488
I hate this town now and everyone
in it.

2439
02:31:20,499 --> 02:31:23,239
I never heard you talk
that way before.

2440
02:31:23,561 --> 02:31:25,161
So bitter.

2441
02:31:26,374 --> 02:31:28,734
Some things would make anyone bitter!

2442
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:33,600
You've quarrelled with your mother
and Hazel on account of me.

2443
02:31:33,805 --> 02:31:35,141
How did you know that?

2444
02:31:36,151 --> 02:31:37,661
Hazel was just here.

2445
02:31:37,672 --> 02:31:41,400
The darned little fool!
What did she have to tell you that for?

2446
02:31:41,917 --> 02:31:43,517
She doesn't want me to marry you.

2447
02:31:43,550 --> 02:31:45,190
The little sneak!  What right has she...?

2448
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,040
You won't pay any attention
to her, I hope.

2449
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,360
No, no.

2450
02:31:53,567 --> 02:31:58,777
She and Mother suddenly got a lot of
crazy notions. But they'll get over them.

2451
02:31:58,796 --> 02:32:01,800
If they don't,
I'm through with both of them.

2452
02:32:04,001 --> 02:32:05,480
Peter.

2453
02:32:06,389 --> 02:32:08,300
Let me look at you.

2454
02:32:08,319 --> 02:32:10,591
Are you beginning to suspect me?

2455
02:32:10,601 --> 02:32:12,800
Are you wondering what it was
Orin wrote?

2456
02:32:12,812 --> 02:32:15,642
Of course not. Don't I know Orin
was out of his mind?

2457
02:32:15,653 --> 02:32:18,366
You swear you'll never suspect me
of anything?

2458
02:32:18,377 --> 02:32:19,507
What do you think I am?

2459
02:32:19,544 --> 02:32:21,854
Nothing can keep us from being happy,
can it? You won't let it, will you?

2460
02:32:21,864 --> 02:32:23,274
Of course I won't.

2461
02:32:23,282 --> 02:32:26,082
Now I'm glad I destroyed
what Orin wrote.

2462
02:32:28,092 --> 02:32:29,644
You destroyed it?

2463
02:32:29,655 --> 02:32:31,645
I burned the envelope, yes...

2464
02:32:31,653 --> 02:32:35,400
Oh, Peter. I want to get married
right away. I'm afraid.

2465
02:32:35,409 --> 02:32:37,350
Would you marry me now, this evening?

2466
02:32:37,360 --> 02:32:39,560
Marry me today, Peter.
I'm afraid to wait.

2467
02:32:39,570 --> 02:32:41,543
But, Vinnie, we can't.
It...

2468
02:32:42,053 --> 02:32:44,500
It wouldn't look right
on the same day that Orin was...

2469
02:32:46,009 --> 02:32:48,051
Out of respect for him...

2470
02:32:49,001 --> 02:32:51,611
I don't see why you're so afraid to wait.

2471
02:32:51,628 --> 02:32:54,144
Nothing can happen, can it?

2472
02:32:55,355 --> 02:32:58,535
Was there anything in what Orin wrote
that would stop us?

2473
02:32:59,348 --> 02:33:01,900
The dead coming between...

2474
02:33:02,312 --> 02:33:04,122
They always would, Peter.

2475
02:33:04,144 --> 02:33:07,311
You trust me with your happiness!

2476
02:33:07,322 --> 02:33:10,782
But that means trusting the Mannon dead,
and they're not to be trusted with love!

2477
02:33:11,994 --> 02:33:15,514
I couldn't bear to watch your eyes grow bitter
and hidden from me the way they are now.

2478
02:33:16,625 --> 02:33:18,475
Wounded in their trust of life.

2479
02:33:19,256 --> 02:33:21,086
I love you too much!

2480
02:33:22,137 --> 02:33:25,065
What are you talking about, Vinnie?
Why did you burn that envelope?

2481
02:33:25,085 --> 02:33:27,655
You make me think there was something...
No, nothing. No!

2482
02:33:27,662 --> 02:33:29,512
Don't think of that, not yet.

2483
02:33:29,527 --> 02:33:32,977
I want a little happiness.
I've earned it, I've done enough.

2484
02:33:32,984 --> 02:33:34,700
Listen, Peter.

2485
02:33:34,712 --> 02:33:36,172
Can't you be strong?

2486
02:33:36,192 --> 02:33:40,500
Can't you be simple and pure?  Can't you
forget sin and see that all love is beautiful?

2487
02:33:43,114 --> 02:33:44,564
Oh, hold me close.

2488
02:33:44,578 --> 02:33:47,638
Want me so much you'd murder anyone
to have me.

2489
02:33:47,659 --> 02:33:50,100
Our love will drive the dead away.

2490
02:33:50,103 --> 02:33:52,243
It will shame them back into death.

2491
02:33:52,264 --> 02:33:54,734
Oh, love me, Adam...

2492
02:33:56,356 --> 02:33:57,311
Adam!

2493
02:33:57,411 --> 02:33:59,800
Oh, why did I call you Adam?

2494
02:33:59,804 --> 02:34:02,700
I never heard that name before,
outside of the Bible.

2495
02:34:04,715 --> 02:34:06,725
Always the dead between.

2496
02:34:06,731 --> 02:34:09,251
Vinnie!  You're talking crazy!  You don't
know what you're saying!

2497
02:34:10,674 --> 02:34:12,644
I can't marry you, Peter.

2498
02:34:12,659 --> 02:34:15,000
There's no use trying any more.

2499
02:34:16,484 --> 02:34:18,364
You mustn't ever see me again.

2500
02:34:20,072 --> 02:34:21,272
Go home.

2501
02:34:21,308 --> 02:34:23,768
Make it up with your mother and sister.

2502
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:25,700
Marry someone else.

2503
02:34:25,708 --> 02:34:28,138
I can't have love.

2504
02:34:29,056 --> 02:34:32,000
Vinnie! What's changed you like this?

2505
02:34:32,037 --> 02:34:34,122
Is it what Orin wrote?

2506
02:34:34,134 --> 02:34:36,370
What was it?
I've got a right to know, haven't I?

2507
02:34:36,390 --> 02:34:40,020
He acted so queer when he talked
about the islands.

2508
02:34:40,030 --> 02:34:42,920
Was it something to do with that native,
that Avahanni?

2509
02:34:43,631 --> 02:34:44,931
Peter!

2510
02:34:47,845 --> 02:34:49,275
All right. If you must know.

2511
02:34:49,294 --> 02:34:51,374
It was Avahanni.

2512
02:34:51,383 --> 02:34:55,713
Oh, no, Vinnie. You couldn't.
I don't believe you.

2513
02:34:56,427 --> 02:34:57,790
Why shouldn't I?

2514
02:34:57,800 --> 02:34:59,460
I wanted to learn love.

2515
02:34:59,483 --> 02:35:01,490
Love that wasn't a sin.
I did, I tell you.

2516
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:04,800
Mother and Hazel were right about you.

2517
02:35:04,804 --> 02:35:07,124
You are bad at heart.

2518
02:35:07,535 --> 02:35:10,465
No wonder Orin killed himself.

2519
02:35:11,479 --> 02:35:14,779
I hope you'll be punished.
I...

2520
02:35:22,670 --> 02:35:25,770
Peter!
It's a lie. I didn't.

2521
02:35:32,696 --> 02:35:34,300
Goodbye, Peter.

2522
02:35:44,707 --> 02:35:49,607
"Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you

2523
02:35:49,778 --> 02:35:55,478
Way-ay, my rolling river

2524
02:35:56,623 --> 02:36:02,323
Oh, Shenandoah, I can't get near you

2525
02:36:03,344 --> 02:36:09,000
Way-ay, I'm bound away

2526
02:36:09,408 --> 02:36:11,458
I'm not bound away.

2527
02:36:11,466 --> 02:36:13,400
Not now, Seth.

2528
02:36:14,303 --> 02:36:16,190
I'm bound here.

2529
02:36:16,196 --> 02:36:18,336
To the Mannon dead.

2530
02:36:22,247 --> 02:36:23,400
Vinnie!

2531
02:36:24,363 --> 02:36:26,500
Don't go in there, Vinnie!

2532
02:36:26,578 --> 02:36:28,948
Don't be afraid.

2533
02:36:28,978 --> 02:36:31,000
I'm not going the way Mother
and Orin went.

2534
02:36:34,088 --> 02:36:36,900
I'll never go out or see anyone!

2535
02:36:36,904 --> 02:36:41,454
I'll live alone with the dead
and keep their secrets.

2536
02:36:41,472 --> 02:36:46,742
And let them hound me till
the curse is paid out
and the last Mannon is let die!

2537
02:36:47,257 --> 02:36:50,900
I know they'll see to it
that I live for a long time.

2538
02:36:50,910 --> 02:36:54,820
It takes the Mannons to punish themselves
for being born!

2539
02:36:54,852 --> 02:36:56,532
Ayeh.

2540
02:36:56,548 --> 02:36:59,818
And I ain't heard a word
you've been sayin'.

2541
02:36:59,999 --> 02:37:03,379
You go now and close the shutters.

2542
02:37:03,396 --> 02:37:05,880
And nail them tight.
Ayeh.

2543
02:37:09,078 --> 02:37:11,400
And throw out all the flowers.

2544
02:37:12,030 --> 02:37:13,280
Ayeh.

2545
02:38:17,156 --> 02:38:24,701
