2
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,437
They're coming. Run!

3
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,152
- No. Come on, this way.
- I think I see them, Mr. Glenn.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,612
- To the water.
- They're heading for the beach.

5
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,866
- Down by the beach.
- Look out. Run.

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,281
No. Doc, no!

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,542
- Don't stop moving.
- They're down there, Mr. Glenn.

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,418
- There they go.
- Okay.

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,874
- Lay down.
- Hurry up.

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,835
Lay down or I'll shoot you, goddamn it.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,294
- Hurry up.
- Lay down!

12
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,295
That's right, shoot them!

13
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,395
I give up, Mr. Glenn. Please

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,018
- Shut up, Henri.
- Please, don't hit me. Please.

15
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,359
Clean him up. Take him to the hole.

16
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,861
And call the press.

17
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,655
Dateline, San Francisco.

18
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:07,239
Alcatraz was the scene last night
of a dramatic escape attempt.

19
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,403
Four desperate prisoners
were apprehended...

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,823
...on the rocky beach below the prison.

21
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,493
The recently completed
Golden Gate Bridge serves as a backdrop

22
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,163
So near, yet so far from freedom
the surviving escapees. . .

23
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:23,004
...Henri Young and Rufus McCain,
are escorted back to lockup...

24
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,216
...while their less-fortunate cohorts
are destined for the morgue.

25
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,930
The body of Doc Barker,
son of the infamous Ma Barker...

26
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,187
...lies bullet-riddled,
cooling on a steel gurney...

27
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,269
...attended by a triumphant guard.

28
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,399
The squad of jubilant correctional officers
who foiled the escape...

29
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:47,032
...congratulate each other
and reluctantly show their battle scars.

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,911
A proud Warden Humson ,
supervisor of three penitentiaries...

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,415
...Folsom, San Quentin and Alcatraz,
and confidant of J. Edgar Hoover...

32
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,542
...congratulates his troops.

33
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,999
Uphold the honor of Alcatraz.

34
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,373
Humson returns to his duties...

35
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,292
...as the inmates are sent
through metal detectors...

36
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,429
...cells are searched,
extra guards are called up

37
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:13,388
...and Alcatraz goes on full alert
to forestall any additional trouble.

38
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,887
As public interest reached a frenzy...

39
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,477
Warden Humson
and Associate Warden Glenn...

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,359
...left the island in the bay
for a press conference...

41
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,236
...headed for the San Francisco City Hall...

42
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,774
...which was inundated
with a veritable plethora of reporters...

43
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,946
...from around the globe,
all gathered to hear the official reaction.

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:39,539
Associate Warden Milton Glenn
introduces Warden John Humson.

45
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,580
Warden Humson will now make
a brief statement...

46
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,465
...and if you please,
no questions at the end.

47
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,796
Thank you.

48
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,260
I just want to reassure...

49
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,921
...the American people that...

50
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,308
...Alcatraz is an escape-proof prison.

51
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,764
They have nothing to fear.

52
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,184
The inmates, McCain and Young...

53
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,225
...will be brought up on escape charges.

54
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:06,066
There will be time in solitary confinement.

55
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,777
Privileges will be taken away from them.

56
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,285
And the whole rehabilitation process
will begin.

57
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,185
"To restore to a state of physical,
mental and moral health...

58
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,816
...through treatment and training. "

59
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,990
Hello.

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,279
Hello, hello, hello.

61
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,080
Eleven times eleven...

62
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,086
...121.

63
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,874
Twelve times twelve...

64
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,506
...144.

65
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,348
Thirteen times thirteen...

66
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,640
...169.

67
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,144
Fourteen...

68
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,018
When Henri Young
began his rehabilitation...

69
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,439
...I was in my first year of law school
at Harvard.

70
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,667
How long?

71
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,150
Alcatraz was opened...

72
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,570
...as a federal penitentiary
in the spring of 1934.

73
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,115
In the era of the gangster,
it was opened more for the publicity value...

74
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,750
...than the incarceration level.

75
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,121
Alcatraz was the most feared prison
in the world...

76
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,960
...and the most expensive.

77
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,626
There were only so many AI Capones
and Machine Gun Kellys...

78
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,216
...so the prison had empty cells.

79
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,006
In order to justify the costs...

80
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,096
...the government took incorrigibles
from other prisons...

81
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,183
...men that had committed smaller,
more petty crimes...

82
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,190
...men like Henri Young.

83
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
Hallowing be thy name.

84
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,858
Our Father who art in heaven...

85
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,399
...hallowing be thy name.
Our Father...

86
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,818
Prior to 1938...

87
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,203
...there had been five escape attempts.

88
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,487
No one had made it.

89
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,124
The reputation of Alcatraz as being
unescapable was secure.

90
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,831
Six inmates had died.

91
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,417
The ones who didn't die
sometimes wished they had.

92
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,138
The federal guideline
regarding solitary confinement states

93
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:32,401
...that the maximum stay for an inmate
shall not exceed 19 days.

94
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,415
Our Father who art in heaven...

95
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,826
...hallowed be thy name.

96
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,667
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

97
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,753
...on earth, as it is in heaven.

98
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,965
Give us this day our daily bread...

99
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,846
...and forgive us for our trespasses...

100
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,760
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

101
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:11,183
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

102
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,191
Amen.

103
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,560
Thank you, gentlemen.

104
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,547
Alcatraz is a half-mile
off the coast of San Francisco.

105
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,431
There were 276 inmates...

106
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,970
110 guards, with their wives
and children stationed on the island.

107
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,106
And the associate warden, Mr. Glenn.

108
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,070
This is the story of Henri Young
as I know it.

109
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:06,320
October 2nd, Game 2, 1936 World Series.

110
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,241
American League Yankees versus
the National League New York Giants.

111
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:15,334
The Yankees...
The Yankees score 18 runs, a series record.

112
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,216
Every single man in that lineup hits
at least once.

113
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,504
Every single man in that lineup scores
at least one run.

114
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,376
Daddy.
- Hello. Hello.

115
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,133
Have you been a good boy?
Here, take Daddy's lunchbox.

116
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,340
We'll go see Mommy.

117
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,503
Good news, Henri.

118
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,760
It's over. You're out of the hole.

119
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,091
You stink, boy.

120
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,898
I did it. I made it.

121
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,655
Unh, come on.

122
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,940
- Did good.
- I made it.

123
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,490
I did it. I did it. I did it.

124
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,746
Unh, come on now. Unh.

125
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,952
You did good.

126
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,789
The only other survivor
of the escape attempt was Rufus McCain.

127
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,797
He had betrayed his fellow inmates
by tipping off the associate warden.

128
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,300
McCain was rewarded
and left in the general population.

129
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,507
Henri Young was sent to solitary.

130
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,967
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey.

131
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,929
Okay, okay, okay.

132
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,138
GLEN
Henri.

133
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:07,649
Some men are broken
by the laws that they break.

134
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:14,493
Unable to resist the forces
that are pulling them down.

135
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:19,205
Other men live by the rules...

136
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,366
...that society has set down.

137
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,836
You're not one of them.

138
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:43,347
Henri, I have a job to do here at Alcatraz.
Do you know what that is?

139
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:47,518
To protect you from yourself.

140
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,772
You were among the selected sinners
the state set apart...

141
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,361
...so that you could simmer in scum.

142
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,533
The good people of the United States
have decided...

143
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,039
...that you are better off here.

144
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,080
I had nothing to do with that decision.

145
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,958
But where I play a part in your life is
to make sure that you stay here.

146
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,011
That you rehabilitate yourself...

147
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,305
...become a model prisoner...

148
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,720
...a better human being.

149
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,928
That's my job, Henri.

150
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,641
You, too, have a job.

151
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,395
And trying to escape...

152
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,028
...is not one of the duties
of your job description, if you follow me.

153
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,156
In life, Henri...

154
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,069
...for every action...

155
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,332
...there is a definite and distinct reaction.

156
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,417
Action...

157
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,423
-...reaction.
- Yes, Mr. Glenn.

158
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,051
Now, if you escape, action:

159
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,012
I lose my job.

160
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,515
I have a family...

161
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,552
...that I will not be able to provide for!

162
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,433
I'm not done yet, Henri.

163
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,231
Now, knowing this information, Henri...

164
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,267
...can you tell me...

165
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:15,071
...why you would possibly
want to escape...

166
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,109
...and jeopardize my family?

167
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,789
I've done nothing to you but my job.

168
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,417
And instead of letting you learn
by breaking the rules...

169
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,756
...I feel I need to show you
how to obey them.

170
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,173
Tolerance.

171
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,173
Tolerance for pain.

172
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,475
My tolerance of you.

173
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,514
But tolerance can be mistaken
for kindness...

174
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,933
...and kindness can be mistaken
for weakness.

175
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,979
And we can't have weakness,
can we, Henri?

176
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,897
I understand. I'll-- I'll-- I'll be good.

177
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,737
I'm not gonna try and run again.

178
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,574
- No, you won't, Henri.
- Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

179
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,784
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

180
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,157
Action, reaction, Mr. Glenn.

181
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,999
- Action, reaction.
- Action, reaction.

182
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,164
Good.

183
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,549
Good.

184
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,753
Good.

185
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,770
Take him to the hole.

186
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,351
Clean him up, take him to the hole.

187
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,016
Christmas, 1939...

188
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,685
...I celebrated visiting with my brother.

189
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,605
Henri Young celebrated in Alcatraz.

190
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,152
Stop it!

191
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,403
Get in here.

192
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,032
Please, no, no, no.
Please, don't put me back.

193
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,410
Please, don't put me back.
Don't put me back.

194
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,788
No. I don't want to. I don't want to.

195
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,871
No. No. No!

196
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,537
--ivy

197
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,497
- They sound great.
- Nice.

198
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,381
Merry Christmas.

199
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,713
- Very good, children.
- Really sounded good.

200
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,924
Standing round a flagpole

201
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,430
And he caught himself a head cold

202
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,263
Been singing it over and over.
I can't get him to shut up.

203
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,927
It gets on your nerves, you know?

204
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,936
In January of 1941...

205
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,097
...I had passed the bar exam.

206
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,268
Henri Young was in his third year
of rehabilitation.

207
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,435
No, Mr. Glenn!

208
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,444
Welcome to Alcatraz, gentlemen.

209
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,234
Step off the boat and onto the dock.

210
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,282
Eyes straight ahead at all times.

211
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,702
There was one boat
named after Warden Humson...

212
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,998
...which handled traffic to and from Alcatraz.
In the morning and afternoon...

213
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,964
...it shuttled the school children
to San Francisco for classes.

214
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,300
It was also used to transport prisoners
to the island.

215
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,388
Whenever possible, having children and
prisoners on the boat at the same time...

216
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,428
...was avoided.

217
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,348
Don't look at the children.

218
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,062
I'll take the kids into the city...

219
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,148
...and we'll go shopping.

220
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,440
Honey, can I call you back?
The warden's here.

221
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,073
- Good morning, warden.
- Good morning.

222
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,036
- When did you arrive on the island?
- About 20 minutes ago.

223
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,245
Good.

224
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,081
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

225
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,038
Mr. Glenn...

226
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,332
...I've been going over
the rotation figures...

227
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,752
...in the solitary-confinement cells.

228
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,841
Is there something wrong, sir?

229
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,133
Well, I don't know.
I don't think this can be right.

230
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,471
What's that, sir?

231
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,011
Well, here, 244.

232
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,807
According to this, he's been in there
since March of '38.

233
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,021
I don't believe there's been
an attitude change...

234
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,185
...with regard to 244, sir.

235
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,026
He's not like the other inmates.

236
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,485
But that's over three years.

237
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,151
He masterminded the escape attempt
in '38.

238
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,195
And there hasn't been an attempt since.

239
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,366
If you let those animals believe
that escape is possible...

240
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,082
...heh, you might as well stick in
a revolving door.

241
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,121
I think he has learned his lesson.

242
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,299
Come on, Henri. Let's go.

243
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,218
Henri Young had been rehabilitated.

244
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,978
I was now a public defender
in San Francisco.

245
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,639
We would meet in three days.

246
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,058
Eat, Young!

247
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,821
You know the rules.
You don't eat, you go to solitary.

248
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,108
Now, get with it!

249
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,657
Two times two is four.

250
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,821
Two times three is six.

251
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,160
Two times four is...

252
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,084
...eight.

253
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,665
Two times five, 10.

254
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,795
Twelve times eight...

255
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,843
...ninety-six.

256
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,268
Hey, Henri, McCain,
he put you in the hole.

257
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,981
Put you in the hole.

258
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,272
McCain's still here. Look.

259
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,190
McCain put you in the hole.

260
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,404
Put you in the hole.

261
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,116
McCain, put you in the hole.
Put you in the hole.

262
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:39,618
Get them back.
Get them back against the wall now.

263
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,669
- What happened?
- I don't know.

264
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,288
The United States of America...

265
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,699
.... Henri Young.

266
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,994
Charged with murder in the first degree.
Approach the bench.

267
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,465
Charged with murder in the first degree.

268
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,545
"Henri Young, Rufus McCain,
in there, striking and wounding...

269
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,055
...sharp steel instrument,
to wit, a spoon."

270
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,091
A spoon. A spoon? Heh.

271
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,884
This can't be right.

272
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,270
That's right.
- If you say so.

273
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,352
"To wit, a spoon,
about four inches in length...

274
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,564
...which, striking and wounding,
described as foresaid...

275
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,070
...caused the said Rufus McCain
thereafter...

276
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:57,860
...to wit, on June 11, 1941 to die."

277
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,620
Trial set one week from Thursday,
June 22.

278
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,247
This court stands adjourned.

279
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,346
I know you can do it.

280
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,805
The fourth at Pimlico, the derby.
Come on, boy.

281
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,811
You can do it. You've got four furlongs.

282
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,847
Don't be cursing this streetcar.

283
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,893
Pick them up and lay them down.
Let those legs just pump like pistons.

284
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:36,485
Yes. Come on. The spirit is willing.
I can see it in your eyes, boy.

285
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,820
Aw, come on.

286
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,235
Pump and go.

287
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,995
Remember Jesse Owens
at the '36 Olympics?

288
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,704
Ha-ha-ha.
Maybe tomorrow, sonny boy.

289
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,433
Watch it, buster.

290
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,586
- Sorry, counselor.
- Jeez.

291
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,714
Gosh, you all right? Heh.

292
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,375
Mary, I'm sorry.

293
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,302
I'm sorry. Mary. you okay?

294
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,550
- Stop that now.
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

295
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:46,058
If Henkin saw us, he wouldn't think twice
about suspending me or you.

296
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,718
- All right.
- Fix your tie.

297
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,432
Why?

298
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,597
You need to look good
when you thank Henkin.

299
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,859
Thank Henkin? What do I wanna thank
Henkin for? The man's a cretin.

300
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,191
- He's given you a case.
- Case of what? Scotch?

301
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,482
Yes, James, a case of Scotch.

302
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,868
What, you mean an actual case
where I stand in front of a jury?

303
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,030
- Federal murder one, no less.
- Henri Young.

304
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,871
He's a convict who killed another convict
in front of 200 witnesses.

305
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,660
What? Wow.

306
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,294
Was it self-defense?

307
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,876
- With a spoon.
- What with a spoon?

308
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,339
That was the murder weapon.
Your client used the spoon to kill the man.

309
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,845
There weren't any
forks or knives available? Great.

310
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,801
My first case, I can't possibly win.

311
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,844
Do this one for the experience for the next
time when maybe your guy didn't do it.

312
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,056
You could learn a lot.

313
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,347
Go see your client
and make nice to Mr. Henkin.

314
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,232
- I'll see you tonight?
- Maybe.

315
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,901
Mr. Henkin, uh...

316
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,279
I wanna thank you very much
for your confidence in me...

317
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,532
I don't have any confidence in you.
The guy is guilty.

318
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,911
A monkey could try the case
and not make it any worse than it is.

319
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,912
- I see.
- Remember that.

320
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,369
- Thank you, sir.
- A monkey.

321
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,869
Heh. I guess I'm a monkey.

322
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,939
James Stamphill here to see Henri Young.

323
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:18,226
I need you to sign a release.

324
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,152
- It's a nice day, huh?
- Yeah, great.

325
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,561
Where are you going?
I wanna go into the cell, talk to my client.

326
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,067
What, are you nuts?

327
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,728
I'd like to speak to him face to face.

328
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,939
Well, ahem...

329
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,152
...you've already signed the release.

330
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,163
It's your life.

331
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,005
Hi.

332
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,676
So, then, Mr. Young, is it?

333
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,672
You're Mr. Young, is that correct?

334
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:35,019
Mr. Young. That is your name, isn't it?
Henri Young?

335
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,934
Why don't I just assume that's your name
until you tell me differently. How's that?

336
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,194
Mr. Young, I will be acting
as your defense attorney.

337
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,697
My name is James Stamphill
and anything you tell me...

338
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,860
...will be protected under the rules of
confidentiality and privileged information...

339
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,701
...of the attorney-client relationship.
So feel free to answer my questions...

340
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,207
...in a totally honest
and forthright fashion.

341
00:26:57,366 --> 00:27:01,746
Now, just for the record,
your name is Henri Young, right'?

342
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:08,590
Mr. Young, this isn't an admission of guilt.
It's just your name.

343
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,590
You speak English?

344
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:17,557
Yeah, you do speak English.
It says so right here in the file.

345
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,980
Okay.

346
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,647
Mr. Young, I am your attorney...

347
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:33,661
...but I'm not gonna be able to provide
much of a defense if one of us is catatonic.

348
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,702
You see, we both have to at least
be able and willing to answer up...

349
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,163
...when our name is called, you know?

350
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,168
Can you hear?

351
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,982
Mr. Young?

352
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,022
You okay, Mr. Young?

353
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,531
Henri Young was born in Kansas in 1913.

354
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:16,032
His parents died 10 years later,
leaving Henri to raise his younger sister.

355
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:21,997
At the age of 17, Henri went into
a local store to try to get a job.

356
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,121
He was refused work.

357
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,835
Out of desperation, he reached
into the cash register and took $5.

358
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,298
The store also doubled
as the town's post office.

359
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:39,430
Henri was tried and convicted
of the federal crime of mail robbery.

360
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:44,477
Henri's sister was taken
to live in an orphanage.

361
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,485
He would never see her again.

362
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,323
Eleven years later,
Henri would kill Rufus McCain.

363
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,933
Mr. Young, you went and killed a guy...

364
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,398
...so you're not catatonic.

365
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,694
So I know that you can talk.

366
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,526
Or at least, I don't know...

367
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,694
...maybe you could write something,
huh?

368
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,409
You wanna write something? Write here.

369
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,752
Something. Just...

370
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,540
Look, you wanna give it a try?
You wanna write?

371
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,839
Just something, please.

372
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,476
Mr. Young, you're looking at me.

373
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,558
You hear me, don't you?

374
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,855
If you don't wanna answer my questions,
maybe we can start with something else.

375
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,567
What do you want, Mr. Young?
There has to be something.

376
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:17,825
It can't be to sit there, because if you do,
they're gonna stick you in the gas chamber.

377
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,985
Do you understand that?

378
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,583
Look...

379
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,546
...Mr. Young, I've read your file.

380
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,932
I am trying to help you.

381
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,139
That's all I'm trying to do.
I just want to help you.

382
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:51,100
Maybe there are extenuating circumstances
in your case.

383
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:57,357
Getting sentenced to Leavenworth
for stealing $500, that's extenuating.

384
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,149
Now, isn't it?

385
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:05,160
Look, Mr. Young, you have to understand,
I'm on your side.

386
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,575
- Five dollars.
- What, Mr. Young?

387
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,837
It was $5, not $500.

388
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,498
Bingo. I knew you had it in you.
Now, come on, Mr. Young...

389
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,292
...why did you kill Rufus McCain?

390
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,596
Come on, come on. You just talked.
Don't do this again.

391
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,349
Come on. No, no, don't quit now.
Come on, you just talked.

392
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,727
Why did you kill McCain?

393
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,315
Huh?

394
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,851
What? Huh?

395
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,149
- What are you saying?
- How...?

396
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,313
How? How? How?

397
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,948
Are you saying "how"?

398
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,450
- How.
- How...

399
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,326
- How?
- How...

400
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,579
- How...
- How...

401
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,708
How. What are you, a fucking Indian?
Come on, don't quit now. How what?

402
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,494
- How is...?
- How is... How is...

403
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,755
You wanna know how somebody is?
I'll find out.

404
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,335
How is...

405
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,500
- Who? How--?
-...DiMaggio.

406
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,843
DiMaggio. How is DiMaggio?

407
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,925
What, is he a prisoner over at Alcatraz?

408
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,638
How is DiMaggio doing this year?

409
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,022
DiMaggio, the baseball player?

410
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,858
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

411
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,236
How is Joe DiMaggio doing this year?
That's what you're asking me?

412
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,817
Yeah. Yeah.

413
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,111
Yeah.

414
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,530
Yeah.

415
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,454
Mr. Young...

416
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,202
...I don't really follow baseball.

417
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,538
You know?

418
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,429
Excuse me, Mr. McNeil?
I'm James Stamphill.

419
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:49,639
Yes?

420
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,974
- I'm counsel for Henri Young?
- Yes.

421
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,981
I was wondering if I could talk to you
about a continuance?

422
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,733
- No.
- You don't understand.

423
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,815
He just sits. I can't get him to speak.

424
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,231
Maybe he's practicing for the gas chamber.
Tell him to take deep breaths.

425
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,776
Heh. Seriously, you won't even consider
a joint motion in the interest of justice?

426
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,072
Are you old enough to be a lawyer?
- Yes, sir, I am.

427
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,707
No joint motion for a continuance...

428
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:16,291
...no psychiatrist,
and trust me, pal, no plea bargain.

429
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,172
Your boy's gonna suck the pipe.
I don't know who you pissed off...

430
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,631
...to get this piece-of-shit case
and I don't care. No breaks.

431
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,064
Mr. Young, DiMaggio is having
a great year.

432
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,443
Last year, he was American League
batting champ with a .352 average...

433
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,947
...which was just a little bit off the year
before when he had a .381 average.

434
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,733
Now, the Yankees,
they too had a good year.

435
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,998
"New York defeats Chicago 4-0,
led by jolting Joe DiMaggio hitting .400."

436
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,955
Four hundred. That's pretty good,
isn't it?

437
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,792
June 17, 1941...

438
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,801
...our friend DiMaggio hits safely
in 32 straight games.

439
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,133
Twelve more and he will tie the record
held by Wee Willie Keeler...

440
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,640
...who set the mark in 1897
for the Baltimore Orioles.

441
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:13,678
Joe Louis emerges the victor
in what some consider to be...

442
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,346
...the toughest win of his career.

443
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,313
Here we go.
Here's some entertainment news.

444
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,948
Betty Grable. See?

445
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,370
It says here, she, uh...
She finished filming--

446
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,499
- How old are you?
- What, Mr. Young?

447
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,500
How old are you?

448
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:41,497
Me, I'm 24.

449
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,587
I think I am too.

450
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:52,591
No, you're, uh...

451
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,968
You're 28.

452
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,773
Mr. Young?

453
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,989
Would you like me
to keep reading to you?

454
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,532
Henri?

455
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,622
This ought to make you
a little bit more comfortable, Henri.

456
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,400
First, the defense requests a new jury.
Having been eliminated from this process--

457
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,855
Three new members.

458
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,817
And that's it. Next?

459
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:52,401
Your Honor, the defense respectfully
requests a continuance of 60 days...

460
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,242
-...so I may confer with my client.
- Your Honor, he doesn't need 60 days.

461
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,374
The facts in this case are so clear,
six minutes would do it.

462
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,910
My client has been almost catatonic
since I met him.

463
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,751
- Yesterday was the first day--
- He wasn't so catatonic...

464
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,588
...that he couldn't walk over and
slit a guy's throat in front of 200 witnesses.

465
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,677
Mr. Stamphill, is it your contention
that the defendant is insane?

466
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,307
Is that what you mean by "catatonic"?

467
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,552
Approach the bench, counselor.

468
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,019
Is this laying the groundwork...

469
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,026
...for a "not guilty by reason
of insanity" plea?

470
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,691
I don't know yet.

471
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,981
I haven't even spoken
to him about the case.

472
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,115
- The first I've got--
One week, counselor.

473
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,778
Then you will either come in
and tell me you are ready to come to trial...

474
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:40,449
...or you will come in here with a request
for a competency hearing.

475
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,164
But, Your Honor--
- One week.

476
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,538
This court is in recess.

477
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,186
Mr. Young, you and me,
we've gotta talk now.

478
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,647
Would you like a cigarette?

479
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,152
No, thanks.

480
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,897
That shit will kill you.

481
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,738
That's kind of funny.

482
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,993
That shit will kill you.

483
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,498
I'm gonna die in that gas chamber anyway,
so that's kind of a joke, huh?

484
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,125
What's this about Nazis? We at war?

485
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,499
No, not yet, Mr. Young.

486
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,004
- It's brand-new.
- What?

487
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,257
- Mr. Glenn told me.
- The associate warden?

488
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,885
He says it's brand-new.
He said they're gonna try it out on me.

489
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,594
No.

490
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,853
Henri, you only have a week.

491
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,764
You've got to talk to me. Okay?

492
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,399
Why did you kill Rufus McCain?

493
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,396
Henri, why did you kill Rufus McCain?

494
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,939
HQW?

495
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,701
How could you not know about baseball?

496
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,914
You said, "I don't follow baseball."

497
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,995
- How could you not?
- Why'd you kill Rufus?

498
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:08,708
Over and over, it must have been
maybe a year, maybe more, I don't know.

499
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,747
All I did was hear them in my head.

500
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,134
What? What are you talking about?
Are you talking about McCain?

501
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,714
I'm talking about baseball.

502
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,221
I'm talking about
the great American pastime.

503
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,349
I went over every game
I ever heard on the radio.

504
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,556
I mean, I went over every game
I ever heard.

505
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,187
Just playing them over and over
in my head.

506
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,977
You had all those games to go to
and you didn't even care.

507
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,111
Henri, I'm talking about Rufus McCain.

508
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,945
And I'm talking about three fucking years
they had me in that bucket!

509
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,737
Three fucking years!
Without any fucking light even!

510
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,873
You had all those games to listen to!

511
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,289
You don't even know
what DiMaggio hit this year.

512
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,963
What kind of asshole are you?

513
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,796
Calm down, boy.

514
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,964
Do you know the average length
of time an inmate would be in solitary?

515
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,177
Nineteen days.

516
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,890
- I understand, but he killed a man.
- Young did more than three years.

517
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,556
- Three years in total darkness.
- That's tragic, but he took a life.

518
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,601
Your brother's gonna tell you
you're not gonna get him off.

519
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,737
My brother is the best lawyer
I know. Somebody to tell me...

520
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,694
...we've got a chance
for some kind of insanity plea.

521
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,609
Your brother's not gonna give a damn.

522
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,823
Your client is a two-time loser.

523
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:27,036
This case is much more
about you than him.

524
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,292
He has no future.

525
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,125
This is your first time in the spotlight.
It's what you worked for.

526
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:39,466
This case is a lost cause,
so you must handle it like a lost cause.

527
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,396
Maybe you're right, but the guy's
not exactly Al Capone, you know.

528
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,682
No. No, he isn't.

529
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,146
All they had him on
was income tax evasion.

530
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:58,314
Your boy, they got on murder one.

531
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,986
Hi. How are you?

532
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,822
Hi, Henri.

533
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,201
Hey, listen.

534
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,829
You're not mad at me
for blowing up at you yesterday?

535
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,082
Because, you know, nobody talks back.

536
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,867
Mad at you? No, I'm not mad at you.

537
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,787
And I'll get the hang of it.
I got a sense of humor.

538
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,456
We gonna have some good times
before this is through.

539
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,751
You know how to play cards?
Could you get some?

540
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,511
Look, look, look, I set this up for you.
Here, sit down.

541
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,343
How much light got into the cell
you spent three years in?

542
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,678
Like when you offered me that cigarette.

543
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,139
I said, no, that shit will kill you.
That was pretty good.

544
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,522
Henri, you gotta help me
if I'm gonna defend you, okay?

545
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,353
Yeah, sure, sure.
- All right.

546
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,648
Look here.

547
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,524
Did you kill this man here?
Rufus McCain?

548
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,360
I must have. I'm here.

549
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,200
I don't remember it,
but everybody saw me, so, yeah.

550
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,790
- But you don't remember it?
- No. But so what?

551
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,041
Did you want to?

552
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,374
You know, once there was this spider
that crawled over me.

553
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,038
It was like having company.

554
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,084
I looked for him again. I couldn't find him.
He had a way out.

555
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,547
McCain was the reason
you landed in the bucket.

556
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,587
One hundred forty-two times 93. Ask me.

557
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:08,509
- How long after you came out of the hole--?
-13,206.

558
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:12,016
Thirteen thousand. You mean, days?
What are you talking about'?

559
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,431
That's the answer, 142 times 93.

560
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,771
- Henri, concentrate on what I'm saying.
- I know what you're saying.

561
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:21,063
- How long was it?
- I don't know. Okay? I don't remember.

562
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:25,075
Hey, what's this new girl
I've seen in the papers? This Ingrid Berger?

563
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,486
She's some kind of looker.
You seen the movies?

564
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:30,747
- Goddamn it. I want you to think.
- I don't wanna think!

565
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:36,162
I spent three goddamn years in the dark,
smelling my own shit and piss...

566
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,954
...doing nothing but thinking.

567
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,919
I hate thinking.

568
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,598
I'm sorry, Henri.

569
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,350
I'm sorry.

570
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,517
I'm just trying to help you.

571
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,106
Hey, you got a girl, right?

572
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,609
- Yeah.
- Take your jacket off.

573
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,866
- What?
- Let me smell it.

574
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,073
You were easier to understand catatonic.

575
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,782
- What's she like?
- Who?

576
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,495
Your girl. That's perfume on your jacket
Let me smell your jacket.

577
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,831
Look, I'll make you a deal.

578
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:21,373
I'll give my jacket, pants,
whatever you want. Sports, girls, whatever.

579
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,292
But you gotta tell me just one memory
about something I ask.

580
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,176
- Deal?
- Sure.

581
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,636
Okay.

582
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,430
I never been with a girl, you know.

583
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,947
Let me try it on.

584
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,113
How long was it
that you went without any daylight?

585
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,244
Did they ever let you out
for any exercise?

586
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,581
- Aah! Please, don't hit me.
- Merry Christmas.

587
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,619
- Get the tear gas.
- How long I been in here?

588
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,584
- You're out of the hole.
- I made it. I did it.

589
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,967
It's Christmas, 1940.
You've been down there two years.

590
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,677
Two years.

591
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,804
I did it.

592
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,592
Two fucking years.

593
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,640
I made it. I made it.

594
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,352
I'm not too crazy, am I?

595
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,437
I did it. It's over.

596
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,101
Nothing's over, Henri.

597
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,646
Thirty minutes exercise,
that's all you get.

598
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:31,990
No!

599
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,279
You don't want it, we take you back.

600
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,823
No, no. I want it.

601
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,787
I want it.

602
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,912
I'll be good. I'll--

603
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,926
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

604
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:58,679
...the defendant, Henri Young,
is accused of murder in the first degree.

605
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:03,271
It is your responsibility as a juror
to deal with truth.

606
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,858
Rufus McCain was murdered
by Henri Young.

607
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,821
Mr. Stamphill, the public defender,
will play upon your sympathies.

608
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:17,080
He will use every trick in the book. Why?

609
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,536
To avoid the gas chamber.

610
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:24,705
The United States of America will demand
that you return a verdict of guilty...

611
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:28,341
...so that this... This animal...

612
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,503
...will receive the punishment commanded
by the Bible.

613
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:36,099
An eye for an eye. A life for a life.

614
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:40,603
For if ever there was a man
guilty of murder...

615
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,855
...it is Henri Young.

616
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:47,777
And if ever a man deserved
to die for that crime...

617
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,279
...it is the accused.

618
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:57,283
Thank you very much, Mr. McNeil.

619
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:03,042
Mr. Stamphill, are you prepared to make
your opening statement at this time?

620
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:07,297
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury.

621
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:12,927
When I was a kid, my heroes
weren't Babe Ruth or Lou Gehrig...

622
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,053
...they were Clarence Darrow, Emile Zola.

623
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,012
In other words, I have waited
for this moment all of my life.

624
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:21,428
To stand like I am right now
in front of a jury of 12 good people...

625
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:25,144
...to plead the case of an innocent man
who's been unjustly accused.

626
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,809
The only problem is he did it.

627
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,819
I know it, the prosecutor, Mr. McNeil,
knows it.

628
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:35,154
Henri doesn't know it because he can't
remember it, but he won't deny he did it.

629
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:38,661
All those witnesses the prosecutor's
going to bring forth will tell you.

630
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,823
Henri Young killed Rufus McCain.

631
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,665
So now that we all know that,
why don't we find the man guilty...

632
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,955
...and gas him because that's
what we all know is going to happen?

633
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,624
- Right, Henri?
- What?

634
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:57,343
There's only one problem that's gonna keep
us from wrapping this up in record time.

635
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:01,180
Henri Young did not act alone.
They haven't caught all the killers.

636
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,719
There was a co-conspirator.

637
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:06,480
It is because of this co-conspirator,
whom we shall name in this courtroom...

638
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,188
...that Henri Young is innocent
of the crime of murder.

639
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,351
What?

640
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,896
Objection, Your Honor. I must protest.

641
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,484
I kind of figured you would.

642
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,524
Your Honor, this is absurd.

643
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:20,571
Before the counselor is allowed to waste
this court's time and this jury's time...

644
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:25,412
...I would request that he supply some proof
or evidence of this co-conspirator.

645
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,918
Mr. Stamphill,
can you bring forward evidence...

646
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,045
...of the existence of a co-conspirator?

647
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:34,129
Not at this time, but it is my intention to
during the course of the trial.

648
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:38,047
He's not going to provide such proof
because no proof exists.

649
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,466
This man spent three years
in solitary confinement...

650
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,556
...during which time
no one had any influence over him...

651
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,893
...because no one had
any contact with him.

652
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,854
He came out of solitary.
He went directly to a shower.

653
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:55,272
Then he went directly to a haircut.
Then he went directly to the dining hall...

654
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,408
...where one convict had said
one sentence to him.

655
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,160
Your Honor, this does not
a co-conspirator make.

656
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,573
I'm inclined to agree with the prosecution,
young man.

657
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,992
Unless you can justify
that line of defense...

658
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,911
...I will sustain
the prosecution's objection.

659
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:14,127
The district attorney, with his own words,
has just made my case for me.

660
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,418
That'll be the day.

661
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:21,681
Your Honor, for three years,
three long, torturous years...

662
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,719
...no one and nothing had any influence
whatsoever over Henri Young.

663
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,387
No one and nothing.

664
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,023
This was a man whose only crime
was to steal $5 from a local post office...

665
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,310
...so he could feed his starving sister.

666
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,229
He came to Alcatraz a petty criminal...

667
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,070
...who had never harmed or attempted
to harm another human being in his life.

668
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,953
And he came out of the dungeon
a vicious, barbaric, maniacal murderer.

669
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,739
A man who had been put
into a kind of psychological coma.

670
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,159
Within an hour of coming out
of that hellhole...

671
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,579
...he did what would have been unthinkable
to him three years before.

672
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:53,962
Unthinkable.

673
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,466
His only thought was murder.
His only instinct was murder.

674
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,343
His first act was murder.

675
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:03,097
Now, he himself was a murder weapon,
but the hand that held that weapon...

676
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,850
...and plunged it into the throat of
Rufus McCain belonged to someone else.

677
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,684
I point to the associate warden, Mr. Glenn,
the warden, Mr. Humson...

678
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,440
...and the institution Alcatraz,
and say, "I accuse."

679
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,523
Objection.
- I accuse them individually and collectively.

680
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,359
I accuse Alcatraz of the torture
of Henri Young.

681
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,984
I accuse Alcatraz of the murder
of Rufus McCain.

682
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,780
Silence! This court will come to order.

683
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,744
Clear the courtroom.

684
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,455
Henri Young is not going to be
the only defendant here.

685
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,961
No. Alcatraz is on trial.

686
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,831
I will address your objection
tomorrow morning.

687
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,208
Henri Young, on trial for his life...

688
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,673
...is seen leaving
the San Francisco courthouse...

689
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,966
...followed by his young and now very
popular public defender, James Stamphill.

690
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:49,102
Stamphill has accused the infamous Rock
of torture...

691
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,139
...using the tagline,
"crimes against humanity."

692
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:57,811
Stamphill has turned the once-quiet trial
of a convict killing into a media circus.

693
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,230
In most cases, they do get better.

694
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:04,697
And in the case of Henri Young, uh...

695
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,115
...this happens not to be true.

696
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:10,373
Young is a noisemaker.

697
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:14,331
Some prisoners have a problem
when they're in, uh...

698
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,961
...ahem, solitary.

699
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,546
All we do
is try to discourage misconduct.

700
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,426
This is the first verbal attack...

701
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:24,508
...on the jewel of the prison system.

702
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,050
This bastion that houses evil
opened in 1934.

703
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,310
It brought gangsters like Capone...

704
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:36,350
...Machine Gun Kelly and Henri Young
close to the magical city by the bay...

705
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,065
...less than one half-mile
from world-famous Fisherman's Wharf.

706
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,480
We went to the streets
to find out public opinion.

707
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:46,321
That's ridiculous. You can't put a place
on trial. It's a prison for prisoners.

708
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,579
Now the murderers are accusing
the wardens of this and that.

709
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,614
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

710
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,033
Warden Humson seems like a good guy.
I like him.

711
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,248
If that place wasn't here,
I wouldn't live here.

712
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,254
- You think it's too close?
- I think it's perfect.

713
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,462
He's innocent until proven guilty
and he'll get a fair trial.

714
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,719
But nonetheless, he's a murderer.

715
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,221
This grizzly evidence bears mute witness...

716
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,929
...to the brutal crime perpetrated
by Henri Young.

717
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,093
Note the spoon.

718
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,183
Can a prison be put on trial?

719
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,849
Judge CIawson's ruling tomorrow
may clear the way...

720
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,689
...to put Alcatraz on trial.

721
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:25,948
"The warden can be relied upon
to carry out the instructions of the bureau...

722
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:30,486
...that no brutality or inhumanity
shall be practiced.

723
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,782
Sustained food and medical attention
shall be given."

724
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:37,543
And we have wholeheartedly
followed those instructions.

725
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,953
Thank you.

726
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,167
So many opinions being expressed.

727
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,630
We attempted to get a statement
from the recent graduate of Harvard

728
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,386
...assigned to defend Henri Young.

729
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,640
Why don't we just keep the trial
in the courtroom? Thank you.

730
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,718
I would like to address a few words...

731
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,602
...to the counsel for the defense.

732
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,139
Mr. Stamphill, you are hereby
put on notice...

733
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,479
...that this court has no interest
in newspaper headlines...

734
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,736
...and will not be swayed by them.

735
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,367
And I further admonish that counsel's
attempts to try this case in the press...

736
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:13,200
...and not before this court,
will put him in the utmost peril.

737
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,162
Is that clear, Mr. Stamphill?

738
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,450
Yes, Your Honor.

739
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,748
Well, good.

740
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,289
Bailiff, approach the bench.

741
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:27,255
Before I hand down my ruling
on Mr. McNeil's objection...

742
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:31,013
...I would like to address a few words
to the counsel for the defense.

743
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:35,426
While I cannot give legal advice
and sit on the bench at the same time...

744
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:40,190
...I will express grave concern
with the defense's strategy.

745
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,191
Counselor, I strongly recommend
you walk a straight line...

746
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,102
...in terms of your defense.

747
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:50,025
Anything you state in this courtroom
will be evaluated not only by the jury...

748
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,363
...but very closely scrutinized by myself.

749
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,700
- Is that understood, Mr. Stamphill?
- Yes, Your Honor.

750
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,078
Very well.

751
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,043
Prosecution's objection is overruled.

752
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,751
Mr. Stamphill, you may pursue
your line of defense...

753
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,132
...concerning the penitentiary
at Alcatraz...

754
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,966
...and I will rule on any objections
on a point-by-point basis.

755
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,381
- Exception.
- Noted.

756
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,141
Mr. McNeil, you may call
your first witness.

757
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,395
Prosecution calls Terrence Swenson..

758
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,181
Court calls Terrence Swenson..

759
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,316
Witness shall remain standing...

760
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,611
...until sworn in.

761
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,742
Put your hand on the Bible.

762
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:37,996
Cut it out.

763
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,578
Swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth...

764
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,164
...in the matter before this court,
so help you, God?

765
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:46,627
So help me God.
- You may be seated.

766
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:51,715
Mr. Swenson, as a guard at Alcatraz,
did you know Henri Young?

767
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:55,598
- Yes, sir.
- Could you point him out for us?

768
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,554
That's him right over there, sir.

769
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,812
Thank you, Mr. Whitney. Thank you.

770
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,395
Now, on the morning of June 11, 1941,
where were you?

771
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:10,025
I was on duty in the dining hall.
And everything was normal.

772
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,610
And I saw the defendant--

773
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,946
- Henri Young.
- That's correct.

774
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,783
I saw him standing over Rufus McCain.

775
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,073
He lifted up his chin and...

776
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,788
- Heh. Excuse me, I'm nervous.
- That's all right.

777
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,124
And he plunged a metal object...

778
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:30,086
...which I later learned was a spoon,
into McCain's throat.

779
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:33,962
He then ripped it open.

780
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,801
Did the defendant ever appear...

781
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,636
...to be ranting or raving?

782
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:38,970
No, sir.

783
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,977
Mr. McKeon, was he frothing at the mouth?

784
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,353
No, sir.

785
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:46,982
Did he in any way give the impression
of one who was insane?

786
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:50,441
Objection. This man is not
a qualified psychiatrist, as far as I know.

787
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,649
Sustained.

788
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:55,988
So it appeared to you that it was a cool,
calculated and deliberate act?

789
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,323
- Objection.
- Overruled.

790
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,328
The witness may answer the question.

791
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,741
Yes, sir. Young did it,
just as cool as a cucumber.

792
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,456
Thank you. No further questions.

793
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,964
This court will reconvene after the holiday...

794
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,045
...9 a.m., July 5th.

795
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,427
All rise.
- You should have played cards with me.

796
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,630
Alcatraz.

797
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:21,266
It was built by the military
during the Civil War.

798
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:26,021
In May of '33, the War Department
abandoned the island.

799
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,651
It was leveled, all except for the lower floor,
which is now used for storage.

800
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,904
I have to get access to the lower level...

801
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,282
...because that's where the dungeons have
gotta be located.

802
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:41,947
The only guard on record to be fired
or dismissed during Henri's solitary time...

803
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,114
...was Derek Simpson.

804
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,908
Locate Simpson.

805
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:50,250
The prison opened in June of '34
under Warden Humson.

806
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,256
He insisted on a high level
of guards to prisoners.

807
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,509
Glenn was the first appointee.

808
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,424
Mr. Henkin.

809
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,464
First, you work for me.

810
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,475
- I was just on my way.
- Let me finish.

811
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:07,058
You work for me, which means
when I call you, you drop everything.

812
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:10,225
You return my call or you will cease
to work for me.

813
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,395
I don't care if you're holed up
with Rita Hayworth. Understand?

814
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,734
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

815
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,285
Now, what the hell
you think you're doing with this trial?

816
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,740
Trying to defend my client.

817
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:25,201
Then why don't you defend him
for chrissake?

818
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,913
Knock down the charges,
say it was a crime of passion...

819
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:31,045
...or figure out how
you're gonna cross-examine witnesses...

820
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:35,458
...instead of this psychological coma crap
that doesn't mean anything in a court of law.

821
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:38,377
But, sir, I think it does.
As long as this is my case--

822
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:43,425
Fair enough. I tried to talk reasonably
to you, but you're not going for it...

823
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,594
...so you're not handling this case anymore.
Done.

824
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,558
Mr. Henkin...

825
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,646
...they're printing my opening statement
in 250 newspapers across the country.

826
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:56,312
If you wanna take me off this because
you're afraid of taking on Alcatraz...

827
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,946
...that's your choice.

828
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:01,609
But I'm just gonna go to Jerry Hoolihan
and tell my side of the story.

829
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:06,155
If you wanna play hardball, sir,
I'll play hardball too.

830
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,295
I'm trying to be your friend, James.

831
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,127
Do you know who the warden
of Alcatraz is?

832
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,793
He is the most respected warden
in this country...

833
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,462
...dealing with
the world's hardest criminals.

834
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,598
If you try to make Humson
look like a Nazi...

835
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,430
...they will eat you for breakfast.

836
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:39,150
Henri, you are gonna die if I can't
get corroboration about what goes on there.

837
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:42,533
I need names. Names of men
who'll come and testify.

838
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,865
What makes you think
these men are gonna come and testify?

839
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:48,030
Maybe you got some friends
you don't know about.

840
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,830
- You wanna play cards?
- I can get a court order. Make them testify.

841
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,462
What's your court order do for them
back on the Rock'?

842
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,999
Mr. Glenn gonna kill them, that's what.

843
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,169
This is the only chance we've got.
We're talking about your life.

844
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:05,215
For a smart guy, you're awful slow.
I'm already dead. I told you that.

845
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,305
You know, you can't change Alcatraz
It just is.

846
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,811
So why fight it?

847
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:14,974
I see you standing up in court preaching.
I don't even know what you're talking about.

848
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,518
Justice. I'm talking about justice.

849
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,528
Jim, I killed him, they saw it,
they gonna kill me.

850
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,610
Nothing you say
gonna make any difference.

851
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,276
So I don't see
what you got to get so excited about.

852
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,197
This trial doesn't interest you at all?
You don't care about it in the slightest?

853
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:33,869
Well, you know, you look like
you're having a good time, so I mean...

854
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,002
No, I don't care.

855
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:40,712
Main thing is, I got a friend my age
to talk to till they gas me.

856
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:45,550
I'm not your friend, Henri, I'm your attorney.
I'm trying to save your life. Guard.

857
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,932
You know, I had a sister...

858
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:51,594
...but I ain't seen her
since they put me in jail.

859
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,013
I got nothing. I got nobody.

860
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,399
I don't need a lawyer. I need a friend.

861
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:01,107
And this so you can prove something
to some guy named Darrow or something...

862
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:05,445
...you're not doing that for me.
Hey, hey, you wanna do something for me'?

863
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,860
Let's play cards.

864
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,410
You go ahead and play cards.
I got a case to try.

865
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,576
Jim. Jim, Jim? Where are you going?

866
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,165
Where are you going? Hey.

867
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,305
I'm Henri Young's attorney.

868
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,090
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

869
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,761
I'm gonna call prisoners to the stand
to testify about life on Alcatraz.

870
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,600
I wanna know where the dungeons are.

871
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,015
What solitary time
in those dungeons is like.

872
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,275
I want the jury to know and understand.

873
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:43,278
You tell them to get caught
robbing a bank. They'll find out.

874
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,273
I'm done talking.

875
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,294
Mr. Murphy, if we can get
decent treatment for you...

876
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,256
...it makes decent treatment possible
for everyone.

877
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:10,969
If we ignore cruelty in one place,
it makes it more acceptable everywhere.

878
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,475
I ain't gonna do shit for you.

879
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,432
You can't get me no good time
knocked off.

880
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,347
You can't get me no privileges.

881
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,141
You can't even get me
seconds at dessert.

882
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:25,814
If I testify for anybody, I testify for the DA.
He's got some juice here.

883
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:32,490
Mr. Baker, could you tell me anything...

884
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,778
...about Henri Young?

885
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,243
Don't know Henri Young.

886
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:40,457
Could you tell us anything
about Mr. Glenn?

887
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:44,832
Warden Glenn has always been
good to me.

888
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,211
Have you ever been in the dungeons?

889
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,756
Ma'am, I don't know nothing
about no dungeons.

890
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:56,302
That's all, ma'am. I gotta go now.

891
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,690
Fuck you.

892
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,065
Did Mr. Glenn tell you...

893
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,852
...not to cooperate with me?

894
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,565
Fuck you.

895
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,231
Where are the dungeons located?

896
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,401
Don't take my fucking picture.

897
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,407
Did you know I can get a writ
of habeas corpus...

898
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,372
...that can force you to come
and testify in a court of law?

899
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,629
Fuck you.

900
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,460
Thank you very much for your time.

901
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,546
Don't mention it.

902
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:32,087
And you, sweetheart?

903
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:35,053
I'd like to fuck you.

904
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,860
Well, I hope your day has been fruitful.

905
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,490
I don't see your photographer.
Is he still taking pictures?

906
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,578
He's trying to.

907
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,243
We're not receiving a great deal
of cooperation.

908
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:07,085
It almost seems someone spoke to the
prisoners and told them not to talk to us.

909
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:10,421
There's no conspiracy.
No one talked to them.

910
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,588
Maybe it's because they are
dangerous people who belong here.

911
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,847
They have no interest
in you or your case.

912
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:19,385
I would like to see the dungeons.
- I'm sorry? Dungeons?

913
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,971
The old Citadel, the sub-level of the prison.

914
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:26,768
That's mostly storage,
a few solitary cells. No dungeons.

915
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,233
I would like to see
the solitary-confinement cells.

916
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,989
I would love to show those cells to you,
but I can't.

917
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:37,528
They're an insurance risk to visitors in case
of a riot. We won't be able to protect you.

918
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,617
Thank you for your concern.

919
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,032
I could show you
the exercise yard, though.

920
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,202
You have papers.

921
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,417
Yes, I have papers.
So you can cut the good-guy act.

922
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:52,756
Mr. Stamphill, the fact is I do consider
myself as one of the good guys...

923
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:57,139
...and perhaps more than you,
I know what the bad guys are like.

924
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,800
No, no, no. I'd like to read them. Please.

925
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,636
Thank you.

926
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:05,476
That is a court order...

927
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:09,109
...instructing you to permit us access
to the solitary-confinement cells.

928
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,487
And allow the photographer, Mr. Kelly,
to take pictures of the same...

929
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:15,445
...to be used as exhibits in the trial
of People v. Young.

930
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,655
You are also instructed
to hand over to us...

931
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,617
...the complete medical
and disciplinary files as to therein.

932
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,453
If you refuse to do so...

933
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:26,368
you will have to appear in court
and show just cause.

934
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,885
Why don't you take
Miss McCasslin out for some air?

935
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,548
- I was instructed not to leave you alone.
- I don't care.

936
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,843
You may be used to these conditions
but obviously she's not.

937
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,352
We've already been searched.

938
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,515
Why don't you take her outside?
Or else we can go right to Glenn.

939
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:51,231
All right. All right. No more photos.

940
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,153
You all right?

941
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,528
Thanks, Mike.

942
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:55,905
I just need some air.

943
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,430
My God.

944
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:45,247
Listen, my name's James Stamphill.
I'm Henri Young's attorney.

945
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,954
I can force them to let you out
so you can testify...

946
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,959
...in San Francisco in a court of law.

947
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:54,248
You just have to give me your name.
I promise I will do what I said for you.

948
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,762
Hey, James, she's okay.

949
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,772
Just needed some air.

950
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:18,272
Can we go now?
- Feeling any better?

951
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,278
I guess I'll make it.

952
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:28,073
- Did you get anything?
- I got three names.

953
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,409
Let's go.

954
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,083
Where did Stamphill get
the three names on this list?

955
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,008
I don't know, Mr. Henkin.

956
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,215
You think you can trust these cons?

957
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,801
They're smart enough
to look after their interests.

958
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:47,183
They told Glenn your boy James said
he'd get them out of solitary...

959
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:50,186
...as long as they testify for the defense
and lie on the stand.

960
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:51,392
That's a lie.

961
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,306
He wanted to find one convict willing--

962
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,692
Mary, Mary, this is goddamn bribery.

963
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:59,855
It's prejudicing a witness. Conduct that
could get you disbarred. It's gone too far.

964
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,274
Fire him. And I don't care how you do it.

965
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,195
- Why do you have to make it be like this?
- Because Henri Young is my client.

966
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:08,614
- It's my job to defend him.
- Not anymore.

967
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:09,827
What?

968
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,163
He's already been notified
that Henkin wants you off the case.

969
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,420
- Henri will never go for it.
- He went for it.

970
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:19,128
- He's been assigned another attorney.
- Who?

971
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,424
Me.

972
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,087
Me. Henkin assigned me to the case.

973
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:27,133
He said I could take it or be fired.
I didn't have any choice.

974
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,302
- A choice to stab me in the back?
- Not stabbing you in the back.

975
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:33,267
- I'm trying to save your job and mine.
- What about Henri?

976
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,058
What about, there's more to being a lawyer
than profit?

977
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:39,023
I don't have a brother
who's a partner in a big law firm.

978
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:42,906
There aren't any other jobs
waiting out there for me either.

979
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,863
The only option I had was to do
what he told me to do.

980
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,904
- What could I have done, James?
- I'll see you, Mary.

981
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,393
What we need to do is establish exactly--

982
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:15,556
We have a lot of work to get to today,
if you don't mind.

983
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,974
Stop that, Mr. Young.

984
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,893
Jesus Christ, all I was doing was looking.

985
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,902
I wanna set you straight about the way--

986
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,735
You set me straight
the minute you walked in here.

987
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,276
- Mr. Young--
- Please, call me Henri. Please.

988
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:31,913
Mr. Young, I am not here to satisfy
any sexual fantasies that you may have.

989
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,455
You're not?

990
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,703
No, I'm your attorney.

991
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,668
Well, they're gonna kill me anyway.

992
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,958
You're not gonna do me any good
as an attorney.

993
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,092
You might as well be good for something.

994
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:48,881
- Mr. Young, I can't--
- Please, please, call me Henri, can't you?

995
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:52,259
I just wanna hear a lady call me Henri.

996
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,972
Can't you, please, please?

997
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,270
Just once.

998
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,976
Please?

999
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:05,440
- Henri, listen, we have so--
- Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's it. That's it.

1000
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,279
Now I'm gonna touch you just a little.

1001
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,745
- Just a little.
- Are you crazy?

1002
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:14,577
Yeah, sure. It's not gonna hurt you
to let me touch you.

1003
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,583
Don't make me call the guard.
We're running late on this--

1004
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,290
Stop that.

1005
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,001
Stop.

1006
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,257
Stop that. Stop that.

1007
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,634
What? I'm not touching you.
I'm touching me.

1008
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,213
Guard? Guard?

1009
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:34,760
You have a problem, ma'am?

1010
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,848
Did he do anything?

1011
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:45,274
- No. No.
- You let me know if he does.

1012
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,279
No, I'd like to leave now, please.

1013
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,716
He wants to see you in there.
- What?

1014
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,630
He wants to see you in there.

1015
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:44,713
So why'd you wanna meet here?
Neutral territory?

1016
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,377
So you wanna be my lawyer again?

1017
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,005
Why? What happened to the other one?

1018
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,425
I don't know if I want her.

1019
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,889
Since I had her, I mean.

1020
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,729
She was good, though.

1021
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:05,438
She was everything I wanted
my first experience to be.

1022
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,399
You know, I was just talking
and she came over.

1023
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:12,236
- She started touching me right on my--
- That's great. That's great, Henri.

1024
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,237
Jim, I'm just playing a joke on you.

1025
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,081
I know she was your girlfriend.

1026
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:28,089
I remember from the smell of that perfume
on your jacket.

1027
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,546
So, lawyer...

1028
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,845
...you wanna come back?

1029
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,893
I resigned.

1030
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:45,690
So I guess that means
I'm in private practice now, huh?

1031
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,319
I could have had her though.

1032
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,024
Of course...

1033
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,865
...she don't play cards.

1034
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,160
After I got arrested...

1035
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,792
...they took my little sister away.

1036
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:10,712
They put her in a home or a orphanage...

1037
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,466
...I don't know.

1038
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:16,801
I don't know what happened to her.
Never saw her again.

1039
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,182
My parents died when I was 7.

1040
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,967
It was just me and my brother...

1041
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,762
...and he didn't know anything
about raising a child...

1042
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,473
...so he sent me off to boarding school.

1043
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,563
I did get to come home on holidays.

1044
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,194
And he put me through law school...

1045
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:36,028
...then got me the job
at the public defender's office.

1046
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:40,320
He always wanted me to do well.

1047
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:44,916
We had a plan until you came along
and messed everything up, Henri.

1048
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:49,379
I wish I had been able to take care
of my little sister, you know?

1049
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:53,462
I mean, family's family, right?

1050
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,174
Henri, I'm sorry you're here.

1051
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,929
Hey, this here's paradise
compared to my last home.

1052
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:06,350
So how about the case?
You wanna talk about that a little bit now?

1053
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,685
You never give up, do you?

1054
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,690
Okay, what about the Redskins?

1055
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:16,902
How do you think they're gonna do
against the Yankees this year?

1056
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:20,489
Jim, the Redskins are a football team.

1057
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,995
Yankees are a baseball team.

1058
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:26,408
Personally, I think the Redskins
would kick the shit out of them.

1059
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,587
Henri, I'm trying.

1060
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,377
I know.

1061
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,877
This is gonna be
a private conversation, Byron.

1062
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,421
It never took place, all right?

1063
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,966
- Is that all right with you, Thurgood?
- I'm the one who suggested it.

1064
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:44,759
That brother of yours...

1065
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,803
...is making quite a little name
for himself.

1066
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,846
We've even heard his name
in Washington.

1067
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,311
My brother has resigned from the case.

1068
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:54,398
Well, he was hired back again last night.

1069
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,562
What do you mean,
he was hired back again?

1070
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,902
Byron...

1071
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,244
...since you made partner,
your work here has been stellar.

1072
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,746
- I would hate to see anything--
- What are you trying to say?

1073
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,704
This administration is not going to allow...

1074
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:11,870
...public attention to be diverted
from all the good it's done...

1075
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,915
...by some kind of a witch hunt
in the Justice Department.

1076
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,675
I'm just telling you what the score
is, Byron.

1077
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:20,257
It's up to you to take care of him.

1078
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:25,175
Why would J. Edgar Hoover care
about what happens to Henri Young?

1079
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,558
Grow up, James.

1080
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,515
He doesn't care
about what happens to Henri.

1081
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:33,775
He cares about Alcatraz,
the Justice Department...

1082
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,685
...Humson, the administration.

1083
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,480
He can't have some kid
from the PD's office-

1084
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:40,944
I'm not a public defender anymore.

1085
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,950
Don't play games. You know the point.

1086
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:47,114
Yeah. The point is I'm trying to do
what's right. I'm talking about justice here.

1087
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,410
You're disgusted about what happened
on Alcatraz. So am I.

1088
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:56,958
But if you tear the whole system down,
what does that say about America?

1089
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,966
We're wrong.

1090
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:01,465
We can't be wrong.

1091
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:06,633
The world is fighting right now
to preserve our system, our way of life.

1092
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,767
You can't attack it blindly.

1093
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:13,272
Byron, we're talking about one man here.
It's not that big of a deal.

1094
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:16,568
- You're under surveillance.
- What?

1095
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:20,317
Everyone is watching you.
Tell me how you plan to continue.

1096
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:26,320
You have to realize, no one will talk.
Everyone has been gotten to.

1097
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,580
I have somebody.

1098
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,241
Who?

1099
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:34,953
I can't tell you.

1100
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:39,174
- So now you don't trust me?
- Byron, you're my brother. I love you.

1101
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,463
I need your help.

1102
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,431
L-- I can't do it, Byron.

1103
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,187
I'm sorry, but I can't.

1104
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,186
I can't.

1105
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:11,073
James, as a consolation...

1106
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:15,243
...please don't put Humson on the stand.

1107
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,169
Why?

1108
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,956
Humson was handpicked by Hoover.

1109
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:25,094
It would save a lot of embarrassment
if you were to avoid Humson.

1110
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,764
I'll think about it.

1111
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:31,889
Thank you.

1112
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,768
I'm sorry, Byron.

1113
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,364
Yeah?

1114
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,875
Mr. Stamphill?

1115
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,751
Yeah. Yeah, this is James Stamphill.

1116
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,754
This is Derek Simpson.
Remember we talked before?

1117
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,041
Right, right. Of course.
Of course, I remember.

1118
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,630
Have you made your decision?

1119
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:06,965
I've been thinking...

1120
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:10,428
...about what we were talking about
and I'd like to be a witness.

1121
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,179
Wonderful.

1122
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,390
Now, you do understand that
you'll have to testify in court under oath...

1123
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,806
...about the brutality you witnessed
at Alcatraz.

1124
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,019
Yes, I know that.

1125
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,559
Particularly in reference to Henri Young.

1126
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,611
I know some things.

1127
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,732
Mr. Simpson, do you hold
any sort of grudge...

1128
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,242
...against Warden Humson
or Associate Warden Glenn?

1129
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,778
No.

1130
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,906
Why don't I just come over
and we can speak in person?

1131
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:37,621
Yes. I'm in Chinatown.

1132
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:43,961
It's an alley called Scotland Court.
The number there is 964.

1133
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,510
Mr. Simpson, are you in here?

1134
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,808
Mr. Simpson, are you all right?

1135
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:15,746
You all right?

1136
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:19,284
Mr. Simpson,
you still wanna be a witness?

1137
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:35,258
- Who's she?
- She's a court reporter.

1138
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:39,937
- What happened to your face?
- My face had a little accident this morning.

1139
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,519
Listen, Henri, we need to get
one more deposition...

1140
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,104
- No.
-...regarding the beatings you received.

1141
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,144
Your eye, your leg. Everything.

1142
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,691
Henri, remember when you told me
you'd never been with a woman before?

1143
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,576
Henri, this is Blanche.
Blanche, this is Henri.

1144
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,032
Nice to meet you, Henri.

1145
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:59,790
You got about four minutes before
the next guard arrives, so you gotta hurry.

1146
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,246
Now, I can't leave the room.

1147
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:04,582
I'm just gonna be over here in this corner.
I'll turn my back.

1148
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,167
We can get acquainted.

1149
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,799
Come on, honey, we don't have all night.

1150
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:18,016
Thanks, Jim.

1151
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,519
You're a good friend.

1152
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:23,389
Boy.

1153
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:33,949
- Um-- Thanks. Hi, Charlie.
- Hey.

1154
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:35,200
What's the story?

1155
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,112
The attorney and a reporter inside
with the prisoner.

1156
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:39,326
Is he shackled?

1157
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,741
Yeah. Other than that,
everything's pretty quiet.

1158
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,248
Sweetie, you have to get it up first.

1159
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:52,385
That's like trying to stick an oyster
into a slot machine.

1160
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,591
Give me that.

1161
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:00,927
Aw, I-- I ca--

1162
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,141
- I can't.
- You can.

1163
01:18:03,304 --> 01:18:06,308
- Yeah, you can.
- I can't. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1164
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:09,147
The 5 bucks you owe me.
- For what?

1165
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:13,235
What, you didn't listen?
Louis knocks Nova out in the sixth round.

1166
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:16,651
- That bum.
- Yeah, yeah. Give me the money.

1167
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,034
- I can't.
- You can.

1168
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,117
I can't. I can't. I can't.

1169
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:21,781
- You can.
- I can't.

1170
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,881
Adios, Charlie.

1171
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,792
All right, kid.

1172
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:35,628
You know what?

1173
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,967
It's gonna cost extra, you know.

1174
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,971
Just do what you have to do.

1175
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:19,805
I can't.

1176
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,635
I'm sorry.

1177
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,140
I can't.

1178
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,024
Hey.

1179
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,819
Hey, we only had a few minutes.

1180
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:45,741
You got another guy in the room.
That's okay.

1181
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:53,706
Hey. Shh.

1182
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,009
Aw, shh, baby.

1183
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,379
Hey. Shh.

1184
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:03,807
Your Honor, the defense calls...

1185
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:06,719
...associate warden, Mr. Milton Glenn.

1186
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:23,740
Do you swear to tell the truth...

1187
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,245
...and nothing but the truth?

1188
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,998
- So help me God.
- You may be seated.

1189
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:41,963
As associate warden, you are responsible
for the day-to-day running of the prison...

1190
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:44,006
-...are you not?
- You could say that.

1191
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,971
You must be familiar with the dungeons.

1192
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:47,180
Dungeons?

1193
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:48,845
I'm sure you've heard of them.

1194
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,810
Some prisoners refer to the lower levels
as dungeons.

1195
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:55,643
They refer to bread and water
as piss and punk.

1196
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,358
Mr. Glenn, the dictionary definition
of a dungeon is:

1197
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,865
"A close, dark prison or vault,
commonly underground."

1198
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:06,404
Now, the walls of those cells measure
6 feet by 9, and the roof is 5 to 6 feet tall.

1199
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:09,198
- Would you call that close?
- As a matter of opinion, no.

1200
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:12,335
- Are there any light fixtures?
- No, but there aren't any books.

1201
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:15,121
Your Honor, the defense
offers these photographs...

1202
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,710
...as defense exhibit B, C, D, E and F.

1203
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,047
How much light comes in
with no window when the door is closed?

1204
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,510
- Not much.
- How long was Henri held in such a cell?

1205
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:25,923
I don't know exactly.

1206
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:29,594
Three years and two months.
I have the records here, if you'd like to see.

1207
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,979
- That sounds right.
- Three years and two months.

1208
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,812
In that time, how often was Henri Young
allowed outside for exercise?

1209
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:40,480
Mr. Stamphill, I do not believe that
the exercise time of an inmate is relevant.

1210
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,193
Well, I do. Answer the question.

1211
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:43,403
Objection.

1212
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,034
Objection overruled.
- Henri Young tried to escape.

1213
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:49,572
Now, when a criminal escapes from prison,
he doesn't go job-hunting.

1214
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,459
He robs somebody or kills somebody.
We do all we can to discourage escape.

1215
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:57,713
In three years and two months, how often
was Henri allowed outside for exercise?

1216
01:21:57,871 --> 01:22:01,341
- I do not believe men sentenced--
- Answer the question I'm asking.

1217
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,094
How often was he allowed outside
for exercise?

1218
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,846
Objection. Badgering the witness.

1219
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,256
Objection overruled.

1220
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,801
Mr. Glenn, you will answer that question.

1221
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,349
Young man, I do not recall.

1222
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:14,889
Heh. You don't know?

1223
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,025
Surely a half hour a year
isn't too difficult to recall, now, is it?

1224
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:21,437
Mr. Stamphill, there is no place
in my courtroom for sarcasm.

1225
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,903
Sorry, Your Honor. Mr. Glenn,
I have here a list with 32 names on it.

1226
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:29,195
Now, these are all men who were prisoners
at Alcatraz during your tenure. Correct?

1227
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:31,409
I can't remember the name
of every prisoner.

1228
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:33,700
I have committal papers
with your signature...

1229
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,539
...as well as the late Dr. Wendell Kiley.

1230
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:38,329
We'd like this to be marked
defense exhibit G.

1231
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:42,671
All of these men were taken off Alcatraz
in straitjackets and placed in institutions.

1232
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:46,007
- Is that correct?
- Objection. The question is immaterial.

1233
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:50,801
Immaterial? Your Honor, I'm saying in lay
terms that Alcatraz drives people insane.

1234
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:52,809
It has already done so in 32 instances.

1235
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,892
If not true, the witness ought to have
the opportunity to say so.

1236
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:58,182
If it is true, it is most material...

1237
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:01,227
and the jury ought to be privy
to that knowledge.

1238
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,942
- Objection overruled.
- Thank you.

1239
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:09,531
Now, is it not true that these men
were taken off Alcatraz in straightjackets...

1240
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:14,073
...and placed in mental institutions and you
and Dr. Wendell Kiley signed the papers?

1241
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,709
- True.
- Is it not also true that of these 32 men...

1242
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:21,168
...28 of them had never before set foot
inside a mental institution?

1243
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,004
- Ha-ha-ha. I don't know.
- I have their records if you'd like to see.

1244
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,043
- Well, I'll take your word for it.
- Okay.

1245
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:29,089
Here are men who came to Alcatraz
legally sane...

1246
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:32,929
...were subjected to the conditions
of Alcatraz, then deemed to be insane.

1247
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,093
- Is that correct?
- Yes, but you can't say...

1248
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,933
...that one causes the other.

1249
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,725
Well, insanity's not a virus, is it?
It's not something we're all going to catch.

1250
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:43,519
Objection, Your Honor.
The witness is not a psychiatrist.

1251
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,153
Objection sustained.

1252
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:49,950
Mr. Stamphill, confine your questions
to areas of Mr. Glenn's expertise.

1253
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:53,783
Very well. Mr. Glenn's expertise.
Have you ever beaten a prisoner?

1254
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,198
No, that would be illegal.

1255
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:56,866
- Not even when provoked?
- No.

1256
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:00,332
You've never hit, kicked,
used a blackjack or straight razor?

1257
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:03,088
You've never punched a prisoner
in your entire career?

1258
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:05,215
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

1259
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,376
Confine yourself
to one question at a time.

1260
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:11,923
Is it not true that you ordered two guards
to throw Henri down a steel flight of stairs?

1261
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:14,308
That you smashed his face
with a blackjack?

1262
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:18,061
That you took a straight razor, sliced open
his ankle, hobbling him for life?

1263
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,813
That's the truth, isn't it?

1264
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:22,566
- Objection.
- The witness has already testified...

1265
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,476
...he didn't beat any prisoners.

1266
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:28,147
Are you aware that, in a federal court
system, perjury is a crime?

1267
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,156
You could spend time in prison.

1268
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,317
I would remind you, young man...

1269
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,486
...Henri Young is the one on trial here,
not me.

1270
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:37,623
I am a public servant.
I am not the bad guy.

1271
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:43,254
I will not be treated the same way as
this lying, murdering, two-time loser!

1272
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,789
Silence, Mr. Glenn.

1273
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:50,007
Mr. Stamphill, you are perilously close
to contempt of this court.

1274
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:53,968
You will proceed with caution.
Is that understood?

1275
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:57,676
Temper, temper.

1276
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,643
Well, would you care to withdraw
any testimony?

1277
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:06,652
You wouldn't want somebody to come along
and testify to the contrary, would you?

1278
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:12,234
No. I would not withdraw any testimony,
no matter what Henri Young has told you.

1279
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:16,074
I'm not talking about Henri Young.
Who would believe him?

1280
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:19,740
Mr. Simpson, did you ever
beat this man, Henri Young?

1281
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,954
Objection, Your Honor.
This has no bearing.

1282
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:25,542
No bearing? Your Honor, beatings have
a bearing on a man's state of mind.

1283
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,672
Three years of darkness has a bearing.

1284
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:29,833
Do we need to be psychologists
to know that?

1285
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,128
You know that, Your Honor.
I know you do.

1286
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,093
- Objection overruled.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1287
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,302
Mr. Simpson...

1288
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:38,718
...did you ever beat Henri Young
with a blackjack?

1289
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:39,931
Yes.

1290
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,892
Did you ever throw Henri Young
down a steel ?ight of stairs?

1291
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:45,183
- I did.
- You were ordered to do this?

1292
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:47,477
- Yes.
- Tell us the name of the man...

1293
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,442
...who was your superior,
who ordered you to do these things.

1294
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,072
- Mr. Glenn.
- Mr. Glenn.

1295
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:55,484
- You never went to Warden Humson?
- No, sir.

1296
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:58,905
Thank you very much. I won't ask
where you got your bruises. I know.

1297
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:00,243
Your witness.

1298
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:03,079
The prosecution would like to mark
for identification...

1299
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,960
...the employment records
of Mr. Derek Simpson.

1300
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:11,171
Do you recall, Mr. Simpson,
being suspended on November 4th, 1936...

1301
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:14,712
...and again on July 6th, 1937?

1302
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,006
- Yeah.
- Speak up, Mr. Simpson.

1303
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:19,095
Yes.

1304
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:24,309
Is it not a fact you were fired from your job
as a guard because you are a drunk?

1305
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,269
- Objection.
- That's not true.

1306
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:27,603
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1307
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:30,895
And that Mr. Glenn would not tolerate this
in a federal prison.

1308
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:33,689
Isn't it true, Mr. Simpson,
having cost you your job...

1309
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:36,779
...you would say just about anything
to get even with Mr. Glenn?

1310
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:39,111
The jury will disregard.

1311
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:41,780
...Mr. Simpson's testimony.

1312
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:46,619
Good afternoon. Mr. Stamphill,
Mr. Stamphill, is everything all right?

1313
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,971
You son of a bitch.
- What happened?

1314
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,054
You know what happened. You set me up.

1315
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:04,345
- What are you talking about?
- You took Simpson's picture.

1316
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:07,435
They never would have known to tear
Simpson down if you hadn't told them.

1317
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:09,770
Are you gonna hit me now, James?

1318
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,230
Go ahead.

1319
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:14,647
It's about time you grew up
and were a man.

1320
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:20,239
You're my brother.

1321
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:25,661
- You had me beaten up.
- James, that was not supposed to happen.

1322
01:27:25,824 --> 01:27:28,327
Only Simpson. You walked in,
it was bad timing.

1323
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,541
Bad timing?

1324
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:34,591
I'm putting Humson on the stand.

1325
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,799
Why, James?
Humson doesn't know anything!

1326
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:42,592
Man runs three prisons. He has to know
something. Unless he's never there.

1327
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,185
Son of a bitch.

1328
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,904
He was never there. Never there.

1329
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:57,530
You never saw him?

1330
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,660
No. You'd hear about
him visiting, but I never saw him.

1331
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:05,489
Now, your own brother did that to you?
Your brother did that to you?

1332
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:08,659
Yeah.
- Jesus, rich people are weird.

1333
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,372
Hey, he)'-

1334
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:14,915
You hear DiMaggio broke Keeler's record?
Forty-five straight games.

1335
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:17,004
Wouldn't it be great if he never stopped?

1336
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:20,546
Dock records show when he was here.
Every trip to Alcatraz is recorded.

1337
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,840
- I had to sign in that time I went.
- Hey, Jim.

1338
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,724
- What?
- We friends, huh?

1339
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,055
Yeah, sure.

1340
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:29,722
Is it over? I mean, you know? Is that all?

1341
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:32,858
Nothing more you're gonna do
with the trial, I mean?

1342
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:35,895
- Thought you didn't care.
- No, I don't care. I don't care.

1343
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:39,941
It's just, you know, long as you got shit
to throw at them, we can keep talking.

1344
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:41,904
But when it's over, it's over, huh?

1345
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:45,071
I'm not here to keep you entertained
until the executioner comes.

1346
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:47,080
- This trial isn't just a game.
- Hey, Jim.

1347
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:48,661
What?

1348
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:56,335
If I was on the outside-- I mean, you know,
if there was, like, a good fairy...

1349
01:28:56,498 --> 01:29:00,002
...and she waved a wand
and I was on the outside...

1350
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,796
...you and me, would we be friends then?

1351
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:06,809
- Yes.
- No, no, no, we wouldn't.

1352
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:10,267
You wouldn't have nothing to do with me.
You know it.

1353
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:13,523
What I can't figure out is why, you know.

1354
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:17,903
I mean, we both ain't got nobody else
and we're the same age, sort of.

1355
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:21,110
And if I'd have lived in your house...

1356
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:25,198
...and they'd have switched us
when we was babies...

1357
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,954
...I could have been just like you.

1358
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:29,865
If they stuck you down in the hole...

1359
01:29:32,075 --> 01:29:34,373
...you could be sitting here just like me...

1360
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:39,292
...asking how come we couldn't be friends
on the outside. You ever steal 5 bucks?

1361
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:48,509
Once, when I was a kid,
from my brother's wallet.

1362
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,644
What happened?

1363
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:56,725
He told me not to do it again.

1364
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:02,360
Why'd they put me in that hole
for three years?

1365
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:06,075
I could have been just like you.

1366
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,948
I'd just like to ask them, you know.

1367
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:27,138
Raise your right hand.

1368
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:31,931
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1369
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,436
So help me God.

1370
01:30:33,845 --> 01:30:35,768
You may be seated.

1371
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:44,694
Warden Humson, in a book you wrote,
you refer to the convicts as your children.

1372
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:49,028
That you liken your job to that of a parent,
providing for their physical needs...

1373
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,037
...and molding their character.

1374
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:53,494
Mm-hm. Yes, I wrote that.

1375
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:58,709
I have a record of a prisoner named Johnson
who did 500 days in the lower cells.

1376
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,043
The hole, the dungeon.

1377
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:05,962
This was a 10-year period for such offenses
as not finishing all the food on his plate...

1378
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:09,927
...having an extra pair of socks
in his cell, keeping an untidy cell.

1379
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:14,724
Um, smuggling food from the dining room,
crumbs, in fact, to a pet lizard.

1380
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,560
Is this what you mean
when you say "molding character"?

1381
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,976
No, no, no. You're twisting things here.

1382
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:26,148
The isolation cells were simply a tool
of a temporary nature...

1383
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:30,740
...for extreme cases
within the general population.

1384
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:35,703
Moreover, you make it sound like
the prisoner did 1500 days at one stretch...

1385
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:37,583
...for one infraction.

1386
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:40,040
That's not true.

1387
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:46,085
No. Prisoners were held
for 19 days at a time.

1388
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:47,844
- That's all.
- That's all.

1389
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:53,095
Perhaps you can tell me why Henri Young
did over 1000 days in the dungeon?

1390
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:55,977
Not 19 days, but 1000 days...

1391
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:59,640
...in total darkness with only 30 minutes
of daylight a year.

1392
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:01,683
Yes. But he tried to escape.

1393
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:06,276
You can't compare his offense with that of
a man who smuggled food to a lizard.

1394
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:09,612
Now, this was the first time a
sentence of three years had been imposed?

1395
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:10,946
It wasn't a sentence.

1396
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:14,158
It was an administrative decision
to place him there, uh...

1397
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,199
...for an undetermined amount of time.

1398
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:21,165
Why not a time limit? Doesn't that seem
a little bit inhumane? No time limit.

1399
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:23,295
Put simply, no.

1400
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:27,960
While we strive to prevent crime...

1401
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:31,221
...what shall we do with the man
who has committed it, hm?

1402
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:34,508
We aim to make him his better self.

1403
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:36,142
His better self.

1404
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,889
Well, I'm sure that Henri Young thanks you
for his better self.

1405
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:44,151
It's a fact you simply put Henri Young
in that dungeon and forgot all about him.

1406
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:45,985
Washed your hands of him.

1407
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:49,694
Henri wanted me to ask you why.
Why would you do that, sir? Why?

1408
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:52,530
- Objection, Your Honor.
- That's not true.

1409
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:55,366
I withdraw the question.
I apologize to the jury--

1410
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:58,577
It's not necessary that you apologize.

1411
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,835
Actually, Your Honor, it is.
You see, I made a mistake.

1412
01:33:01,993 --> 01:33:05,213
Warden Humson couldn't simply
have washed his hands of Henri Young.

1413
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:06,418
He couldn't have.

1414
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:09,334
Because he had absolutely no idea
he was there.

1415
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,595
Isn't that true, warden?
You are never there.

1416
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:14,677
And you permit Glenn to run that prison
any way he sees fit.

1417
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:18,594
I am there as much as I need to be.
I run three penal institutions.

1418
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:23,060
It's impossible to know every detail
of every inmate.

1419
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:25,100
I have the port authority records...

1420
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:28,190
...which you signed
every time you went to Alcatraz.

1421
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:32,529
You went seven times in '38,
five in '39, 10 in '40...

1422
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:36,740
...and only twice so far this year. Twenty-four
day trips in three and a half years...

1423
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:40,373
...while Henri Young was in that dungeon
over 1000 days.

1424
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:42,910
Twenty-four out of 1000 days.

1425
01:33:43,076 --> 01:33:45,204
That's as much as you needed
to be there?

1426
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,374
You knew nothing about a man
who was left to die in a dungeon...

1427
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,089
...for three and a half years, did you?
Absolutely nothing.

1428
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:55,222
In fact, you have never even met
Henri Young, have you?

1429
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:59,385
Right now, in fact, is the first time
you have ever seen this man. Look at him.

1430
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:02,307
That's him there. That's Henri Young.
Right there.

1431
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,347
- He tried to escape.
- He tried to escape.

1432
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:07,518
But the fact, the cold, brutal fact,
Warden Humson...

1433
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:11,439
...is that this man, who had never,
never before in his entire life...

1434
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:14,608
...harmed or attempted to harm
another human being, never...

1435
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:17,072
...was now a murderer.
That is a fact, is it not?

1436
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:19,658
- Yes. No, he tried to escape.
- It is equally a fact--

1437
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:22,495
You can't let them get away with this.

1438
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:24,910
If we let them get away with this,
where would we be?

1439
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:29,206
- What? Should we let murderers roam free?
- Henri Young was not a murderer.

1440
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:32,626
Henri Young was not a murderer
until Alcatraz got a hold of him.

1441
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:37,389
Now, the prison runs under your guidelines,
so you created the murderer, didn't you?

1442
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:39,265
Didn't you?

1443
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:43,603
He tried to escape.

1444
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:47,857
That's the thing, you see.

1445
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:53,901
Mr. Stamphill...

1446
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:56,782
...do you have any further questions
for this witness?

1447
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:01,321
- No, Your Honor.
- The witness may step down.

1448
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:03,285
But he tried to escape.

1449
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,334
I'd been trained all my life for that day.

1450
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:09,120
Control the witness, go for the kill.

1451
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,915
Win, victory.

1452
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:14,049
School prepared me well

1453
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:16,837
My brother, he had prepared me well.

1454
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:20,382
Years later, he and I would reconcile.

1455
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:23,226
Family's family, you know.

1456
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:29,100
Mary congratulated me,
but we'd already begun to drift apart.

1457
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:33,899
When you only try to win,
you sometimes lose sight of the goal...

1458
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:36,113
...which should have always
remained Henri.

1459
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:50,370
No way they're gonna
send you to the gas chamber.

1460
01:35:50,536 --> 01:35:52,834
Most is second-degree murder.
Maybe manslaughter.

1461
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:55,841
Ten years, if you get clemency,
and you'll walk.

1462
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,550
- You'll have your whole life in front of you.
- Monday morning...

1463
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:03,467
...I want you to get up to that judge
and tell him there's been a change of plan.

1464
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:06,887
I want you to get up there
and change my plea to guilty.

1465
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:10,815
- That's a joke, right?
- Not to me, it's not.

1466
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:12,567
I'm not doing it.

1467
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:16,525
What the hell have I been doing here?
Why have I been wasting my time?

1468
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,986
I never thought we'd win.

1469
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:21,071
I thought you wanted to fight.

1470
01:36:21,234 --> 01:36:24,363
I just wanted a friend.

1471
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:28,374
- Henri, I am your friend.
- No, you're not. No, you're not.

1472
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:30,706
It's always about you.
It's never about me.

1473
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,745
You don't understand.

1474
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,539
I already lost.

1475
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:39,212
You just keep talking and talking
and talking. And you never listen.

1476
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:42,256
You certainly don't know
what you're talking about.

1477
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:44,971
- You just don't know what it's like.
- What what's like?

1478
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,385
Alcatraz!

1479
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:51,102
Where do you think they're gonna send me
those 10 years you're talking about?

1480
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:53,392
They're gonna send me back to Alcatraz.

1481
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:56,903
- Henri, when it's over, you'll be alive.
- I'm Henri.

1482
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:00,733
I'm the one that's gotta do the time,
not you.

1483
01:37:00,898 --> 01:37:03,572
And I can't do it. I can't do it.

1484
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:06,409
I can't, all right?

1485
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,865
Listen, it's not worth it.

1486
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:11,159
It's not worth it.

1487
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,540
Nothing's worth going back there.

1488
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:15,000
Mm-mm.

1489
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:19,129
Sixty-seven thousand fans...

1490
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:21,260
...at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland...

1491
01:37:21,419 --> 01:37:25,845
...watching to see if Joe DiMaggio can keep
his 56-game hitting streak alive.

1492
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:30,308
Jim Bagby on the mound, works the count
to 1 and 1, runner on first base.

1493
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:32,472
Here's the pitch. Joe DiMaggio swings.

1494
01:37:32,638 --> 01:37:35,061
It's a ground ball hit out to short
to Lou Boudreau.

1495
01:37:35,224 --> 01:37:38,819
He ?ips it to Ray Mack for one out.
The relay to Grimes at first...

1496
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:41,231
...it's in time for a double play.

1497
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:44,617
Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak
is stopped.

1498
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:53,042
Yeah?
- Mrs. Rosetta Dial?

1499
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:10,385
Why are we in here, Jim?

1500
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:13,976
Maybe there are some things
worth fighting for, Henri.

1501
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,154
Henri?

1502
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:24,486
Do I know you?

1503
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:28,820
I'm-- I'm Rosetta, Henri.

1504
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:32,573
I'm your sister.

1505
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:37,040
Um...

1506
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:40,878
My, uh...

1507
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:44,673
My baby's name is Henri.

1508
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,635
You know, Mr. Stamphill says that--

1509
01:38:52,802 --> 01:38:55,601
I was...

1510
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:58,441
...beginning to think...

1511
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:03,021
...that you wasn't real. That I...

1512
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,528
...made you up in my mind.

1513
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,866
- I want you to come--
- Rosetta.

1514
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:16,418
I want you to tell Jim that I appreciate
him bringing you down here...

1515
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:20,376
...and knowing that you turned out okay.

1516
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:25,009
That means a lot. I want you to tell him,
come Monday morning...

1517
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:29,551
...he's gonna plead me guilty
just like I said.

1518
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:37,018
I wish I wasn't so scared of them,
Rosetta.

1519
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,893
I wish to God I wasn't.

1520
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:01,830
You take care of yourself now.

1521
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:08,040
You may call your
next witness, Mr. Stamphill.

1522
01:42:08,205 --> 01:42:10,207
Your Honor, be just a second.

1523
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:11,755
I'm your friend.

1524
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:14,466
On the outside,
I'd be lucky to consider you my friend.

1525
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:16,506
Therefore, I'm not gonna kill you.

1526
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,551
Are you going to call a witness
sometime today, counselor?

1527
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:21,390
Yes, Your Honor.

1528
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:25,147
If you wanna change your plea, you go up
there and do it. I'm not gonna do it.

1529
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:27,559
- Plead me guilty.
- I don't think you are guilty.

1530
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:29,443
- That doesn't matter.
- It does to me.

1531
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:32,572
Okay, counselor, I am very close
to finding you in contempt of--

1532
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:34,983
Your Honor, the defense calls
Mr. Henri Young.

1533
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,446
No.

1534
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:37,861
He just lost the case.

1535
01:42:38,027 --> 01:42:40,029
You wanna change your plea,
you go up there.

1536
01:42:40,196 --> 01:42:42,870
I repeat, I'm not gonna do it for you.

1537
01:42:44,617 --> 01:42:48,247
Counselor, unless--
He's coming, Your Honor.

1538
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:50,544
Go ahead, tell them.

1539
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:01,801
Tell them, not me.

1540
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:08,979
- You better ask me the right questions.
- I'll ask what I want.

1541
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:10,859
- And I'll answer what I want.
- Fine.

1542
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,110
Fine.

1543
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:19,949
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

1544
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:27,285
Stand up. Put your hand on the Bible.

1545
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:34,000
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth...

1546
01:43:34,166 --> 01:43:36,134
- ...so help you God?
- So help me God.

1547
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:39,342
- State your name for the records.
- Henri Young. Henri Young.

1548
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:41,132
Be seated.

1549
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:42,471
Your Honor--

1550
01:43:42,633 --> 01:43:44,556
Wanna wait until I've asked a question?

1551
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,847
- I haven't asked yet.
- He's trying to trick me.

1552
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:50,642
Please instruct the witness to refrain
from speaking until I ask a question...

1553
01:43:50,808 --> 01:43:52,981
...and then just to answer
the question I ask.

1554
01:43:53,144 --> 01:43:55,693
- He's your witness, counselor.
- He won't listen to me.

1555
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:58,734
- He trying to trick me. I just--
Silence, Mr. Young.

1556
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:03,322
Now, here's the way it works.
Mr. Stamphill will ask you a question...

1557
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,205
...and you may answer that question.

1558
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:09,744
However, Mr. Stamphill cannot coerce you
into testifying against yourself.

1559
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,583
Now, you do understand that?

1560
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:12,918
Yeah, I just want to--

1561
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:17,085
Did you and I have a conversation in which
you told me you wish to change your plea--?

1562
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:22,849
Mr. Stamphill, you will wait until
I have finished instructing the witness.

1563
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:25,430
That's okay.
That's the question I wanted him to ask.

1564
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,812
It is not okay.

1565
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:32,771
And I do not need you to tell me
what is or is not okay.

1566
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:35,861
In this courtroom,
I am the one who decides...

1567
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:39,024
...what is or is not okay.

1568
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:40,863
Okay?

1569
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:44,195
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Well, thank you very much.

1570
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:48,036
Counselors, approach the bench.

1571
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:54,671
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell is going on here?

1572
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:56,047
I'm just trying--

1573
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:59,427
I mean, your own defendant
is looking to me to protect him from you.

1574
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:00,677
So, what's going on?

1575
01:45:00,836 --> 01:45:03,214
I know, Your Honor,
it seems very strange but--

1576
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:07,101
As far as I'm concerned, you're an idiot
to put him on the stand for any reason.

1577
01:45:07,259 --> 01:45:09,762
Asking your own client
to testify against himself.

1578
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:14,025
It doesn't seem to make a lot of sense,
but the prosecution isn't objecting so--

1579
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:15,856
No, I'm not. Let him continue.

1580
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,361
Shut up.

1581
01:45:17,895 --> 01:45:19,989
- Stamphill--
- Enough damage has been done.

1582
01:45:20,147 --> 01:45:24,493
- I don't think I can mess things up any more.
- Yes, you can.

1583
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:28,539
All right. All right.
But you're on a very short leash, Stamphill.

1584
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:30,415
A very short leash.

1585
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:33,453
I will throw you in jail
for contempt myself.

1586
01:45:34,495 --> 01:45:38,250
Now, let's get this goddamn show
on the road.

1587
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:44,672
Don't let him rattle you, James.
I think you're doing a great job.

1588
01:45:46,423 --> 01:45:48,266
Mr. Young, stop playing with that.

1589
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:56,396
Now, do you or do you not wish
to continue testifying, Mr. Young?

1590
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:58,937
It's okay. He asked me the right question.

1591
01:45:59,770 --> 01:46:02,239
Counselor, you may proceed.

1592
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:08,697
Mr. Young, did you and I not have
a conversation last Friday...

1593
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:11,912
...which you told me
you wished to change your plea to guilty?

1594
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:15,207
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's...

1595
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:18,213
I wanna change my plea.
That's what I told you.

1596
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:21,876
I'm gonna ask you the single
most important question I can ask you.

1597
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:23,919
It's what this whole trial is about.

1598
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:26,801
Are you guilty of the murder
of Rufus McCain?

1599
01:46:26,964 --> 01:46:29,843
I wanna change my plea to guilty.
That's what I said.

1600
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:33,309
I didn't ask what you said you wanted to do.
I asked if you are guilty.

1601
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,893
Objection, Your Honor.
He's badgering the witness.

1602
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:38,809
- He's my witness, for chrissakes.
- I'm not your nothing.

1603
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:42,230
If the accused wants to enter
a plea of guilty, I don't know why--

1604
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:46,902
Silence. Mr. Stamphill,
you are skating on very thin ice here.

1605
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:50,613
Maybe, Your Honor,
but I'd like to get to the other side.

1606
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:56,369
Very well. You may proceed,
at your own peril.

1607
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:57,582
Thank you.

1608
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:04,092
Let me take this one step at a time.

1609
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:08,806
Mr. Young, we had a conversation
in which I told you...

1610
01:47:08,964 --> 01:47:12,389
...I felt with the way the trial was going,
the most you'd have to face...

1611
01:47:12,551 --> 01:47:16,055
...more than likely, would be
another 10 years. Maybe even less.

1612
01:47:16,221 --> 01:47:18,815
- You don't give a shit--
- Ten years, that's what I said.

1613
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,066
Yeah, yeah, but--

1614
01:47:20,225 --> 01:47:22,899
And then did you say to me,
that you were Henri...

1615
01:47:23,062 --> 01:47:25,656
...you were the guy
who had to do the time, not me?

1616
01:47:25,814 --> 01:47:28,818
You were the one back in Alcatraz
to do those 10 years, right?

1617
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:32,033
That's what I told you.
Why are you doing this to me?

1618
01:47:32,196 --> 01:47:36,042
Because, Mr. Young, if you change
your plea to guilty, they will execute you.

1619
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,247
You will die.

1620
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:38,535
So fucking what?

1621
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:40,420
I'd rather die than go back there!

1622
01:47:53,676 --> 01:47:56,395
- What did you say, Mr. Young?
- I said...

1623
01:47:57,763 --> 01:48:01,563
I said I'd rather die than go back there.
Can't you understand that?

1624
01:48:02,101 --> 01:48:05,571
Why, Henri? Why do you want to die?

1625
01:48:05,854 --> 01:48:07,572
Because.

1626
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:10,576
Because I'm...

1627
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:14,245
I'm scared of them.

1628
01:48:14,530 --> 01:48:17,704
I'm scared to go back there. I'm scared.

1629
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:19,709
I'm scared. I'm scared.

1630
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:23,088
Objection. He's finished--
I haven't finished anything.

1631
01:48:23,706 --> 01:48:25,424
Henri, look at me.

1632
01:48:25,582 --> 01:48:28,131
Henri, look at me. Look at me.

1633
01:48:28,293 --> 01:48:31,888
You were right. You were right,
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

1634
01:48:32,047 --> 01:48:34,926
I'm just talking to you right now.
Not the judge or the jury.

1635
01:48:35,092 --> 01:48:37,060
If you wanna die, we'll back you up.

1636
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:39,347
I swear to God,
I will fight these bastards...

1637
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:41,641
...so they will never do this
to anyone again.

1638
01:48:41,807 --> 01:48:43,935
You are not gonna die for nothing.

1639
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:46,524
The choice is yours, Henri.

1640
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:47,938
What do you wanna do?

1641
01:48:54,153 --> 01:48:57,032
I wanna stop being afraid.

1642
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:06,339
All right.

1643
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:42,500
Henri Young...

1644
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:47,289
...are you guilty of the murder
of Rufus McCain?

1645
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:10,692
I was the weapon...

1646
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:13,907
...but I ain't no killer.

1647
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:18,279
They're the murderers.

1648
01:50:29,081 --> 01:50:32,460
Bailiff, you may remove the prisoner.

1649
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:35,671
Escort the prisoner to the holding room.

1650
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:04,992
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1651
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:07,708
you have received your instructions.

1652
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:11,670
You may find the defendant guilty
of involuntary manslaughter...

1653
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:15,553
...which carries with it a maximum penalty
of three years...

1654
01:51:15,711 --> 01:51:18,260
...in which case the defendant
will be remanded...

1655
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:21,767
...to the custody of the warden
of Alcatraz.

1656
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:26,897
Or you may find the defendant guilty
of murder in the first degree.

1657
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:29,433
Without a recommendation for mercy...

1658
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,946
...that verdict will carry with it
a sentence of death.

1659
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:24,697
This court is now in session.

1660
01:52:25,364 --> 01:52:29,119
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
how do you find?

1661
01:52:29,451 --> 01:52:31,499
The defendant will rise.

1662
01:52:33,372 --> 01:52:34,498
We, the jury...

1663
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:36,338
...find the defendant, Henri Young...

1664
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:39,003
...not guilty of murder
in the first-degree...

1665
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:40,842
...and guilty of involuntary manslaughter.

1666
01:52:42,172 --> 01:52:43,674
Order. Order.

1667
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,887
Your Honor...

1668
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:47,803
...we would like permission
to address the court, if possible.

1669
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:49,313
Very well.

1670
01:52:49,471 --> 01:52:52,099
Your Honor,
we have this day signed a petition...

1671
01:52:52,266 --> 01:52:54,689
...which I would like to read to the court.

1672
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:59,023
"We would like the following to be read
into the record of this proceeding.

1673
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:02,944
Though we know it will have
no legal or binding effect...

1674
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:06,159
...we'd hope that it will have
a moral effect.

1675
01:53:07,406 --> 01:53:10,501
We, the members of the jury,
recommend and request...

1676
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:14,129
...an immediate investigation
by the proper federal authorities...

1677
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:18,043
...of the federal penitentiary
known as Alcatraz.

1678
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:22,509
We find this institution, its warden,
and associate warden...

1679
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:24,469
...guilty of crimes against humanity."

1680
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,553
Thank you. The jury is dismissed.

1681
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,563
This trial is concluded.

1682
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:34,726
All rise. The defendant
is remanded to the warden of Alcatraz.

1683
01:53:36,059 --> 01:53:37,527
News from San Francisco.

1684
01:53:37,686 --> 01:53:39,359
The Young trial concludes.

1685
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:42,070
The Rock will be investigated
as Young is vindicated...

1686
01:53:42,232 --> 01:53:45,406
...by a verdict
of involuntary manslaughter.

1687
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:47,913
As I walked out of the courtroom that day...

1688
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:52,126
...I did not fully realize how much
Henri and I had actually accomplished.

1689
01:53:52,284 --> 01:53:54,207
It all just happened so fast.

1690
01:53:54,369 --> 01:53:57,623
Henri, Henri, I'm gonna be up to see you
as often as I can.

1691
01:53:57,789 --> 01:54:00,759
And then you can bring
that Blanche back for a second shot, huh?

1692
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:02,669
Yeah, I'll try. See what I can do.

1693
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:04,088
No place like home.

1694
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:06,427
Henri, it's not over.

1695
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,719
It's not over. I'm gonna appeal
to have you moved to another prison.

1696
01:54:09,885 --> 01:54:13,105
I'm gonna file motions
to have your original case reopened.

1697
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:15,891
Henri and Jim, together again, huh?

1698
01:54:16,058 --> 01:54:18,436
That's right.
Henri and Jim, together again.

1699
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:21,939
- Henri and Jim, together again.
- Hey, Jim.

1700
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:26,281
I won, didn't I?
I mean, I really did something.

1701
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:27,569
I won.

1702
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,493
That's right, Henri, you won.

1703
01:54:30,906 --> 01:54:34,956
Hey, Jim, how many games
was DiMaggio's hitting streak?

1704
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:36,620
- Fifty-four?
- No.

1705
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:38,209
No, I got you.

1706
01:54:38,372 --> 01:54:39,715
It was 56, wasn't it?

1707
01:54:39,873 --> 01:54:41,125
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

1708
01:54:44,252 --> 01:54:46,471
I'll see you soon, Henri.

1709
01:54:47,005 --> 01:54:48,973
Take care of yourself.

1710
01:55:05,982 --> 01:55:08,155
The definition of victory is:

1711
01:55:08,318 --> 01:55:11,242
"Success in any contest or struggle.

1712
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:14,617
Engagement ending in triumph."

1713
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:28,221
That was to be the last time
I was to see Henri Young alive.

1714
01:55:29,047 --> 01:55:33,177
Before the court date was set for an appeal,
his body was found in a cell.

1715
01:55:33,969 --> 01:55:37,519
- He laid beneath a single word-

1716
01:55:38,473 --> 01:55:40,146
"Victory. "

1717
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:44,317
Henri Young taught me
the meaning of the word.

1718
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:58,706
He was the only man that I have known
who gave more than he asked.

1719
01:55:58,869 --> 01:56:01,668
All that he ever wanted was a friend.

1720
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:05,880
And I will always remember him
as one of the best friends I have ever had.

1721
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:13,384
Unlike many men that live much longer,
Henri Young did not die in vain.

1722
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:16,936
In the end, he was not afraid.

1723
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:20,649
He lived and he died in triumph.

1724
01:56:22,684 --> 01:56:25,028
If only we could all do that.

1725
01:56:34,196 --> 01:56:35,743
Welcome home.

1726
01:56:37,365 --> 01:56:39,413
I've missed you, Henri.

1727
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:46,421
Mr. Glenn...

1728
01:56:47,959 --> 01:56:52,135
...you can beat me,
you can put me back in that hole...

1729
01:56:52,297 --> 01:56:53,719
...whatever you wanna do...

1730
01:56:54,883 --> 01:56:57,102
...it doesn't matter to me.

1731
01:56:58,553 --> 01:57:00,271
Action:

1732
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:02,520
I won.

1733
01:57:03,141 --> 01:57:05,064
Reaction:

1734
01:57:05,268 --> 01:57:08,568
You can't ever take that away from me.

1735
01:57:23,161 --> 01:57:25,038
Take him to the hole.

1736
01:57:46,434 --> 01:57:50,735
Charles Dickens once said
that solitary confinement was inhumane.

1737
01:57:51,022 --> 01:57:54,276
Seven months later,
the Supreme Court agreed.

1738
01:57:54,442 --> 01:57:58,572
And as a result of the facts brought out
in the trial of The People v. Henri Young.

1739
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:01,867
...the dungeons of Alcatraz
were closed forever.

1740
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:06,083
Associate Warden Glenn was brought up
on charges of mistreatment.

1741
01:58:06,246 --> 01:58:10,547
He was found guilty. He would never work
in the penal system again.

1742
01:58:11,001 --> 01:58:13,754
I remained in private practice.

1743
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,264
I also became a baseball fan.

1744
01:58:17,716 --> 01:58:19,559
You did it, Henri.

1745
01:58:20,305 --> 01:58:26,194
