{33559}{33635}-I don't believe in aliens.|-I heard that!
{33638}{33724}To us, you are the alien.
{33727}{33792}If you must know,|I am from the planet you call Mars.
{33795}{33892}-And what, I'm from Uranus? I never-|-I was getting to you!
{33895}{33945}Don't get a crease in your Sputnik.
{33948}{34000}Please,|just introduce me to monkey boy.
{34003}{34100}This is my Zoot.
{34103}{34188}-A polymorphous Zootenex 3,000.|-Just look, don't touch.
{34191}{34272}-Your suit talks?|- Incessantly.
{34275}{34321}Corduroys talk,|nobody gives them grief.
{34324}{34372}- Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.|-Mars? Wait a minute.
{34375}{34467}There's no life on Mars.|We've sent probes.
{34470}{34555}I'd try to explain it, but you people|still think "E" equals "MC" squared.
{34558}{34656}-You're still trying to|analyze our rocks. Ha-ha!
{34659}{34744}Oh! Blasted sand particles.
{34747}{34823}They've completely crystallized|the vortex generator.
{34826}{34884}-Hey, do you mind?|- Tim!
{34887}{34928}-Now what?
{34931}{34987}-Thank God, an eyewitness.|-Eyewitness? Negative.
{34990}{35088}-You must tell no one.|-No offence, but your ship is|double-parked in my living room.
{35091}{35149}You're the biggest story|in the history of mankind!
{35152}{35216}There is intelligent life|out there in the universe!
{35219}{35260}I hope you're not including yourself|in that statement!
{35263}{35328}Tim, listen, I'm sorry to bother you|so early in the morning,
{35331}{35377}but I got a hold of your mail,|and I wanted-
{35380}{35465}Could you just- please, come here.|Take a look at that!
{35468}{35537}Aaah!
{35540}{35656}Tim, you definitely need a maid!|Oh, hello!
{35711}{35827}-Greetings.|-Oh, I'm sorry to catch you|in your... pyjamas.
{35830}{35917}-Pyjamas? - Where's the spaceship?
{35920}{35980}- Spaceship?|-Right here.
{35983}{36053}Oh, for the rummage sale!|Does it come with an action figure?
{36056}{36125}-You're looking at him.|-Oh. I don't believe we've met.
{36128}{36200}-No, don't touch him! He's a Martian.|-Tim, what's going on?
{36203}{36249}-I beg your- Mart- Martin?
{36252}{36312}-Yes. Martin.|-No, no, no, no!
{36315}{36372}-He's a- uh-|-Uncle!
{36375}{36452}-Martin.|-Oh.
{36455}{36528}-Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.|-He turns invisible, okay?
{36531}{36577}His suit talks-|he's got a talking suit.
{36580}{36628}He's got these things that|pop out of his head- You just-
{36631}{36688}-Show her. Go ahead.|Come on, give her the finger.|-Tim!
{36691}{36796}No, I didn't mean that.|I don't know what I mean. Forget it.
{36799}{36869}You'll have to forgive Tim, Mrs. Brown.|He lost his job last night,
{36872}{36920}and he's experiencing|a nervous breakdown.
{36923}{36973}Oh, poor dear.
{36976}{37024}-I hope it doesn't affect the rent.
{37027}{37096}-Don't worry,|I'm here to look after him.|-Ha!
{37099}{37191}He's very lucky to have|an uncle like you in his life, Martin.
{37194}{37284}And you, Mrs. Brown,|are like a brilliant quasar|in the black hole of my day.
{37287}{37363}Oh! Call me Lorelei.
{37366}{37433}Lorelei.|The sound of...
{37436}{37532}pure mountain spring water|from the centre of the Earth.
{37535}{37598}Oh, my.
{37772}{37841}Oh!
{37844}{37929}I obviously misconstrued a custom.|I apologize.
{37932}{38012}I'm from... New York.
{38015}{38083}No, actually, it's- It's fine.
{38086}{38172}It's perfect. 
{38175}{38243}-Oh, brother.|-Oh, Martin?
{38246}{38292}Yes, Lorelei?
{38295}{38436}Um, Mr. Brown... passed away|several years ago.
{38439}{38556}-I thought you might like to know that.|-Hmm.
{38559}{38647}Au revoir.
{38650}{38696}Hmm?
{38699}{38757}Just for the record,|a handshake will do for me.
{38760}{38808}You think that I actually enjoyed...
{38811}{38860}tasting that female's exoskeleton?
{38863}{38956}I merely used my data on|your primitive species to determine...
{38959}{39015}the optimum way|to avoid suspicion.
{39018}{39103}-Yeah, but what's the optimum|way to get home?|- Blotz!
{39106}{39211}I don't know, Zoot. Where on this|barbaric swamp of a planet...
{39214}{39291}can we find the makings|of an electron accelerator?
{39294}{39364}-Maybe your new girlfriend has one.|-Oh, that's very funny.
{39367}{39447}Excuse me. Fellas,|I don't mean to interrupt, but...
{39450}{39572}I-I, you know, I think I might be able|to help you find that electron thing.
{39575}{39615}We're toast.
{39620}{39683}I don't believe this.|You really think you can...
{39686}{39732}repair your ship|with all this junk?
{39735}{39789}Everything has been carefully chosen|for its potential to fashion...
{39792}{39852}a crude vortex electron accelerator.
{39855}{39925}Except for this.|A pooper scooper.
{39928}{39992}I have no idea what it does,|but it's fascinating.
{39995}{40103}Excuse me. Where are your|nuclear implosion couplers?
{40106}{40162}For a garden hose?
{40207}{40276}I'm never going to get off|this infernal planet.
{40279}{40331}The I.Q. of a pancake.
{40334}{40381}You're right. Humans are truly|the amoebas of the universe!
{40384}{40445}Yeah, this from a guy|who talks to his tin foil suit.
{40448}{40521}-Hey, what was that for?|-It wasn't me, it was Zoot.
{40524}{40621}-Come here a sec.
{40624}{40688}Listen, you've been on Earth,|what, all of ten minutes?
{40691}{40748}-It's not so bad here.|- That's what Neenurt said.
{40751}{40844}-Who?|-Exactly. One of my planet's|most gifted scientists,
{40847}{40908}and now he's gone without a trace.
{40911}{41000}He arrived on Earth in 1964,|and, I presume, was abducted|by your government.
{41003}{41053}I shudder to think what they did to him|in the name of science.
{41056}{41157}-What are they laughing at?|- Hey, space man!
{41160}{41232}-I've been discovered!
{41235}{41295}-Sorry about that.
{41298}{41337}-Oh, my-|-What happened?
{41340}{41393}They don't know anything.|They were just making fun of your-
{41396}{41477}Making fun. I'm one of|the best-dressed beings on my planet.
{41480}{41528}Yo, Elvis! Nice suit.
{41531}{41632}Well, Dorothy, I hate to tell you this,|but you're not in Kansas any more.
{41635}{41684}That's great.|The minute I turn my back,
{41687}{41744}you're getting into|someone else's pants!
{41747}{41819}I need to blend in,|and you stand out like a putt|stick at a blackbell convention.
{41822}{41868}I should have known|by the way you've been gawking...
{41871}{41920}at every T-shirt|and sweat pant we pass.
{41923}{42001}-Don't come apart at the seams!|-Why is Zoot always the last to know?
{42004}{42060}-All right, all right, all right!
{42063}{42153}-Martian footage, take one.|-Zoot, this is tearing me apart too.
{42156}{42223}I know I'm not what I used to be.
{42226}{42292}I mean, a stretch mark here,|a line stain there.
{42440}{42504}-Hey!|-Pervert!
{42507}{42579}It's not safe|for a woman around here!
{42582}{42629}I'm ready to blend in now.
{42740}{42819}-Outstanding.|-Martin, that outfit looks ridic-
{42822}{42885}-Stylin', bro!|-Thanks, bro.
{42888}{42936}Real cool.
{42939}{42985}I've got the touch on two planets.
{42988}{43043}I gotta get out more.|How did your Zoot take the-
{43046}{43100}Zoot, he's highly intelligent.|He understands.
{43103}{43184}Aaaah!|You used me, you buttonhole!
{43187}{43284}-Go and have your fling.|Colours fade! You'll see!
{43287}{43343}-Hello?|-Huh? Oh, incoming.
{43346}{43409}Hello?|Man.
{43443}{43492}Oh, geez!
{43495}{43560}Talk about a tacky suit!
{43563}{43608}-Tacky, huh?
{43659}{43725}Hey! Hey! What?
{43783}{43857}-Now turn the other cheek.|-Ow! Hey!
{43860}{43945}-Catch you later, Spanky.
{44050}{44103}All right, I'm bustin' out!
{44106}{44153}-There.|-Go ahead, try 'em all on.
{44156}{44236}See if I care.|Whoa!
{44239}{44324}If love is a crime, lock me up!
{44327}{44423}I'm guilty.|Look at her.
{44426}{44487}A perfect size six,
{44490}{44575}and never been worn!
{44578}{44680}Darling, don't speak.|Just come to me. 
{44683}{44772}Oh, this is crazy.|I'm a polymorph, and you're a polyester.
{44775}{44845}Yes, you're synthetic,|but I like that in a girl!
{44848}{44911}Give me some thread, baby!
{44914}{44992}-Oh, what's this, Velcro? Ohh!|-Zoot!
{44995}{45060}Ah! No, thank you, little girl,|I don't want to buy any cookies!
{45063}{45143}You lecherous leotard!|Have you no shame?
{45146}{45220}Look who's talking,|Mr. Clothes Horse!
{45223}{45317}Now, in you go, or you'll take|a long walk on a short hanger.
{45320}{45368}Coming in for a landing!|Flaps down!
{45371}{45463}-I said bag it, mister!
{45466}{45547}All right, all right, you don't|have to throw me in the hamper.
{45635}{45686}Dork.
{45747}{45816}-Next time, the dry cleaner.|-Bite these.
{45819}{45888}You- Blasted nurplex!
{45891}{45997}Oh, Venus, Neptune!
{46000}{46060}-Help me, Tim!|-Mm-hmm.
{46063}{46128}Tim, it's a little blue one!
{46131}{46193}No!|Give me that,
{46196}{46257}you age-impaired little blotz.
{46260}{46308}Mine! Gum!
{46311}{46388}-Mine! Nurplex!
{46580}{46641}Why wouldn't you give|the kid a piece of gum?
{46644}{46727}Okay, sure, right.|Here, have one.
{46730}{46783}-Come on, let's go. No, no, come on.|-What are you doing?
{46786}{46836}-What are you doing?|-Trust me.
{46839}{46883}-Not the finger! Don't do the finger!|-Try some.
{46886}{46941}-Why?|-You don't want to try Martian gum?
{46944}{47043}-No, not particularly.|-Afraid, Earthling?
{47215}{47276}You know what, that is not bad.
{47279}{47396}-The centre's got|a nice little zing to it.|-Notice anything different?
{47399}{47464}Hmm, no.|No, not really.
{47467}{47543}What time do you have?
{47546}{47592}Aaaah!
{47595}{47667}Aaaah!
{47670}{47744}-Spit, spit, spit.
{47812}{47944}-Everything okay in there?
{47947}{48037}-Zipper trouble.|-Yeeow.
{48104}{48180}This "gum", as you call,|allows me to take on the outward|appearance of a human being.
{48183}{48231}On you, it has the reverse effect.
{48234}{48305}Oh, so that's what you|really look like.
{48308}{48380}Don't be disgusting.|That was Fluvian Nurplex.
{48383}{48452}-Oh.|-We carry many different planets.
{48455}{48576}If you think that was bad,|this is Veenox Seven.
{48579}{48675}-Oh, well, that's-|-Don't ever mess with a Veenox Seven.
{48678}{48766}When it comes to Veenox Seven,|just say no.
{48872}{48920}Me man got fire
{48923}{48988}Me so on fire|feeling hot, hot, hot
{48991}{49057}All right, come on, the rest of you,|come on up on stage!
{49060}{49141}The sun, while you can get it.|The sand, the surf.
{49144}{49215}Usually, the beach conjures up|images of our youth,
{49218}{49319}but come on down to Sunset Pier today,|and your contraceptions of-
{49322}{49372}-Preconceptions!|-Contraceptions.
{49375}{49419}-Preconceptions!|-Felix!
{49422}{49477}I said preconceptions!|I swear, preconceptions!
{49480}{49564}-Billy! Billy!|-Preconceptions!|I know I said preconceptions!
{49567}{49640}I should listen to my parents|and be a doctor. I hate this!
{49643}{49704}-Ooh!
{49707}{49772}-Are we still rolling?|-Nobody said "cut."
{49775}{49841}-Feeling hot, hot, hot|-What do you think?
{49844}{49892}I think your bathing suit|should have a top.
{49895}{49955}Cut! Cut! Cut!
{49958}{50041}-Felix!
{50044}{50100}Felix is toast.
{50103}{50167}If Tim doesn't get here soon,|we could all be looking for work.
{50300}{50387}Wait here.
{50390}{50436}What is the meaning|of this divergence?
{50439}{50509}-I gotta see some friends.|-Negative! Exclamation point.
{50512}{50577}We're wasting valuable time.|My ship must-
{50580}{50667}Look at that!
{50670}{50720}Do you have any idea|how fortunate you are?
{50723}{50797}The only water we get back on Mars|has to be squeezed from rocks.
{50800}{50879}-Well, surf's up, dude.|-Tim, I'm so glad you came.
{50882}{50944}-Hurricane Brace hit again.|-Oh, okay. Uh, Martin?
{50949}{51000}-I gotta go. I'll be right-|-Lizzie!
{51003}{51060}How nice to see you again.
{51063}{51133}-Have we met?|-Of course!
{51136}{51212}Not. How nice to see you again|for the first time.
{51215}{51277}I'm Tim's Uncle Martin.
{51280}{51401}-Oh, I-
{51443}{51502}-I, uh-
{51579}{51676}-What was that?|-I must find nourishment.
{51679}{51744}-That came from your stomach?|-Stomachs.
{51747}{51824}Oh, he is- He is such a kidder.
{51827}{51880}Listen, I'll be with you|in couple minutes, okay?
{51883}{51944}You just- I'll be right over.|Tell her to-
{51947}{52012}We gotta get you- ah!
{52119}{52169}Excuse me, could I have|a double dip-
{52172}{52229}actually, make that a triple dip,|chocolate chip, please.
{52232}{52321}-Yes, sir.|-Tim, I need nourishment,|not coloured buckets of frozen lard.
{52324}{52400}Look, this is very|nutritious food here on Earth.|We eat this for breakfast.
{52403}{52487}Tim, you don't need to try poison|to know that it kills.
{52490}{52563}Here, take this.
{52566}{52628}Give me five minutes, okay?|I have to go to the news van.
{52631}{52703}Blecch!
{52706}{52788}- Felix!|-I said "preconceptions", I swear!|Preconceptions!
{52791}{52885}You unprofessional little man!|All you have to do is come up|with the dumb things I say!
{52947}{53068}-Billy!|-Brace! Brace!
{53071}{53160}-You'd rate this tantrum?|-About a seven-five on the Brace scale.
{53163}{53277}-I'll talk to Felix.|-You never told me about your uncle.
{53280}{53341}Are you-
{53344}{53436}Look, I'm glad you beeped me. We really|need to talk. This is really big.
{53439}{53497}-I know.|-You do?
{53500}{53556}Yes. Look, I've been thinking, and...
{53559}{53651}our friendship really means a lot to me,|and I don't want to screw that up.
{53654}{53708}-Okay.|-So I think it would be better...
{53711}{53808}if we just pretended that nothing|ever happened between us last night.
{53811}{53879}-What happened last night?|-Exactly!
{53882}{53936}I'm not sure I understand what-
{53939}{53987}Me either.
{54110}{54185}I guess we're both a little confused,|huh, Tim?
{54284}{54349}-Easy, easy.
{54352}{54441}I thought you were her. She's terrible,|Tim. How did you last so long?
{54444}{54492}She's a little high-maintenance,|but she's okay.
{54495}{54608}-Oh, lust is blind.|-Do we still have that hidden camera|stuff somewhere?
{54611}{54715}You're sitting on it.|Why?
{54718}{54780}-Here, let me help you with this.|-Would you please?
{54783}{54852}-These words are way too big.|-Huh? Humidity?
{54855}{54917}-Hot.|-Oh, oh, oh, oh.
{54920}{54975}Wave for everybody!
{54978}{55096}By God, if I were only 40 years older,|I'd be right there with 'em!
{55163}{55209}- Miss Channing?|-Hmm?
{55212}{55298}-Could I have a word with you, please?|-Okay.
{55347}{55422}I've already signed it.
{55456}{55512}Come on, who are you guys, huh?
{55799}{55845}Okay, guys, you're all set.
{55848}{55896}-Where's Brace?|-I don't know. She took off.
{55899}{55956}She quit!|And her dad gonna blame me!
{55959}{56012}Hey, what's going on|over there?
{56015}{56108}-Uh, Billy, put that in my car.
{56111}{56163}-I gotta go.|-Call me!
{56166}{56216}Martin!
{56475}{56544}-I like it!|-Martin!
{56638}{56739}Tim, you're here!|You've got to save me from myself!
{56742}{56872}It's intoxicating.|Ooh, cookie dough!
{56875}{56968}-I need to get you back to the home!
{56971}{57036}All they give him there is Jell-O.|There we go.
{57139}{57195}Cookie dough!
{57540}{57598}Martian footage, take two.
{57819}{57879}-Chubby Hubby hangover, huh?
{57936}{58000}I swear, I'll never|touch that stuff again.
{58003}{58072}One scoop's too many,|and a million aren't enough!
{58075}{58152}So, how's it coming, anyway?
{58155}{58207}Oh, I converted a blow dryer,|two elastic bands...
{58210}{58283}and an Acme Bug-Away insect bomb...
{58286}{58332}into a temporary electron accelerator.
{58335}{58392}-Is it working?|-Not at all, but on the positive side,
{58395}{58444}your garage is now cockroach-free.
{58447}{58509}Blasted rental!
{58512}{58569}-This is a rental, is it?|-My regular ship is in the shop...
{58572}{58632}for its mid-millennium tune-up.
{58635}{58695}Where's your, uh, you know,|your suit, Zoot... thing.
{58698}{58776}Oh ho, washing up.
{58779}{58840}-Owwww! Spin me, mama!
{58843}{58909}So nice, so good
{58912}{58968}Five more minutes, Zoot,|then into the dryer.
{58971}{59048}You're bringing me down, man!
{59051}{59155}What I wouldn't give|to shed this grotesque human facade...
{59158}{59252}and let the cool Earth waters|caress my Martian skin.
{59255}{59335}-Oh!|-So why don't you?
{59338}{59396}Why not, indeed?
{59399}{59468}-Move over, Zoot!|-Martin, I meant-
{59471}{59543}I meant out in the hot tub, out back.|It would be private, by yourself.
{59546}{59620}You mean spit out my Nurplex...
{59623}{59680}and revert to Martian form|right outside your domicile?
{59683}{59768}-Exactly.|-Oh, do you think that's safe?
{59771}{59828}Oh, yes, of course it's safe.
{59831}{59893}-I'll do it!|-Good. Let's go.
{59896}{59943}Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
{59946}{60000}-Tim? Thanks.|-Yeah?
{60003}{60049}It's just a hot tub, Martin.|No big deal.
{60052}{60100}I don't mean just that.|I know I must have...
{60103}{60179}created complete havoc with your|simple life since the moment I arrived.
{60182}{60265}Anyway, I just wanted to say...|thank you.
{60383}{60445}Hello!
{60448}{60515}Hello!|Would somebody please...
{60518}{60566}come and tell me|what's going on here?
{60636}{60700}All right, Miss Channing.
{60727}{60792}Do you know what this is?
{60795}{60841}This has been|positively identified...
{60844}{60904}by my team of experts|as your cigarette.
{60907}{60999}It was discovered|at the site of a U.F.O. crash!
{61002}{61068}-What?|-And on it are trace elements...
{61071}{61165}of what we believe|to be alien DNA.
{61168}{61259}-Alien?|-Oh, don't play dumb with me!
{61262}{61332}You are an alien...
{61335}{61402}inhabiting the body of a woman!
{61456}{61536}A very, very attractive woman.
{61539}{61584}Oh, please.
{61587}{61655}Dr Coleye, we've run the tests|on the other cigarette.
{61658}{61704}It's human DNA.
{61707}{61784}Oh.|So sorry.
{61787}{61896}An honest mistake.|So, Miss Channing,
{61899}{61956}do you have any idea|how alien DNA...
{61959}{62015}ended up on your cigarette?
{62018}{62124}I might. First of all,|let's talk about what's in this for me.
{62127}{62253}The safety of this entire planet|may depend on what you say to me.
{62256}{62331}There's nothing in it for you!
{62334}{62417}-Dr Coleye.
{62420}{62504}May I call you... Doctor?
{62507}{62576}Think about it.|When this story breaks,
{62579}{62684}you will be the most|famous scientist in history.
{62687}{62796}You will be on the cover|of Scientific... whatever.
{62799}{62924}You will be the man|that proves that aliens exist.
{62927}{63051}And I will be the woman|who tells the world your story.
{63102}{63156}We'll do it together.
{63159}{63228}Okay.
{63935}{64020}-Tim?
{64023}{64073}What are you doing up there?
{64076}{64136}My Uncle Martin's in the hot tub,
{64139}{64192}and I'm... watching.
{64224}{64310}Oh.
{64342}{64411}What a strange family.
{64414}{64500}You can, uh-|You can sleep here.
{64503}{64565}-You guys do sleep, don't you?|-Oh, most definitely.
{64568}{64644}Oh, great.|We have something in common.
{64647}{64696}You're very kind, Tim O'Hara.
{64699}{64812}-No, just very tired.|-Ohh, enjoy your rest cycle.
{64815}{64876}-I'll do the same.
{64879}{64932}I could use a little shut-eye.
{64935}{64992}- So could I.
{65060}{65124}-Rise and shine!|-Yeah, yeah right.
{65127}{65173}What's on tap for today, Tim O'Hara?
{65176}{65225}I feel like a million radix.
{65228}{65280}Hey, it's still tonight.|You've been asleep for 30 seconds.
{65283}{65368}Thirty seconds?|Wow, I really was tired.
{65371}{65436}What are we waiting for?
{65439}{65524}There's a whole metropolis out there|just waiting to be discovered!
{65527}{65573}No, not in the middle|of the night, there isn't.
{65576}{65636}I feel like ice cream,|and there's no time like the present.
{65639}{65743}Hello? Why aren't they open?
{65746}{65840}-What's wrong with this planet?|-I told you they don't open till 10:00.
{65843}{65917}-I could be first in line.|-They aren't gonna let you in|when they do open,
{65920}{65994}not after that little stunt|you pulled yesterday.
{66106}{66212}-We call that breaking and entering.
{66215}{66321}Ah, the smell of moist air.
{66324}{66416}I'll never forget this.|Your ocean!
{66419}{66483}Ice cream!
{66486}{66541}This primitive planet|may not compare to Mars,
{66544}{66596}but it's not the rotten rock|I thought it was.
{66599}{66652}Don't look now,|but I think we're being followed.
{66655}{66704}Impossible.|My acute sensory perception...
{66707}{66753}would have detected that immediately.
{66756}{66829}Now it's working.
{66832}{66877}Hey! Hey, buddy!
{66880}{66933}-What are you doing?|-I've been discovered!
{66936}{66988}-I'm doomed!|-No, no, no, just calm down.
{66991}{67037}It's probably|just some tourist or something.
{67040}{67124}Besides, even if you did get caught,|you'd probably be, you know, welcomed.
{67127}{67191}Welcomed?|Tim, where do Earthlings put...
{67194}{67265}their most beautiful|and rare animals?
{67268}{67316}If I don't get that spaceship fixed,|I'm finished,
{67319}{67367}just like Neenurt.
{67370}{67433}Can you fix it?|'Cause I'm dyin' here.
{67436}{67500}I need a drink, is what I need.
{67555}{67620}Yeah.|Downy the hatch.
{67716}{67795}-What was that?|-What in blazes?
{67798}{67864}-What is it?
{67867}{67937}Oh, blotz!
{67940}{68012}Zoot, an I.S.S.!
{68204}{68289}-Blasted rental!
{68292}{68384}-Owww! Spin me, mama!
{68387}{68471}-So nice, so good
{68619}{68695}Uncle Martin, what are you-
{68912}{68963}-Tech department.|- Hi, it's me.
{68966}{69037}-Oh, hi.|-What are you doin'?
{69040}{69103}Uh, research.
{69106}{69188}Have you ever got into your head how-|how you felt about somebody,
{69191}{69292}and then something they said or did|just suddenly changed your mind?
{69295}{69357}Well, yeah, I-
{69360}{69413}Could you come over?
{69416}{69492}Please, I really need to see you.|It's important.
{69495}{69575}Sure. Could you give me|like a half an hour?
{69578}{69675}- You're the best, Lizzie.|-Okay, see ya!
{69678}{69724}Oh, my gosh.
{69873}{69948}-Martin?
{69951}{70012}-I'm not like you.
{70015}{70079}I need more than|twelve seconds of sleep.
{70082}{70184}All I need is one lousy|electron accelerator...
{70187}{70233}for a vortex generator.
{70236}{70300}But can I build it?|No.
{70303}{70372}You'll do it. You just gotta|give yourself a little time, that's all.
{70375}{70460}Time! I have no time!
{70463}{70511}I just discovered|that this blasted rental...
{70514}{70571}is equipped with an I.S.S.!
{70574}{70641}-Yeah, what's that?|-Interstellar Safety System.
{70644}{70712}A detonation mechanism|designed to prevent...
{70715}{70795}advanced technology|from falling into the wrong hands.
{70798}{70880}It's timer activates automatically|at the point of a crash.
{70883}{70944}Okay, wait,|I heard "detonation" somewhere in there.
{70947}{71036}If I don't take off by 9:00 tonight,|you'll hear a lot more than that.
{71039}{71135}-Uh, how much more?
{71138}{71212}-Uh-huh.|-Lublick.
{71215}{71335}-Uh, you b-
{71483}{71544}Ahhh!
{71626}{71721}I know you've done your best|to help me, but it's no use.
{71724}{71805}Oh, no.
{71808}{71900}I'm sinking into|a Martian depression.
{71903}{71961}Sinking? No, no sinking.|Come on, we gotta go fix this thing.
{71964}{72015}I'm falling apart, Tim.
{72018}{72066}Oh, no, you're not.
{72069}{72145}-Come on.
{72148}{72227}-Yes you are.|-On Mars, when we get depressed,
{72230}{72332}we literally fall apart!
{72335}{72395}-Okay, no problem.
{72398}{72456}Don't move, don't make it|any worse than it already is.
{72459}{72528}-What we're gonna do is|we're gonna put you back together.
{72531}{72604}Does it screw in?|It's not-
{72607}{72712}-Okay, just-aaah! No!|-I wanna go home!
{72715}{72773}-We're gonna put our heads together-
{72776}{72835}-Aaaah!
{72838}{72880}-Coming!|-Who's that?
{72883}{72934}-It's Lizzie!|-Lizzie? Oh, no.
{72970}{73016}You wait here.
{73019}{73072}-Where are you going with those?|-Just tidying up!
{73075}{73144}Give 'em back! Give me back my arms!|Give me back-
{73147}{73215}Why do I have to die here?
{73243}{73288}Hello?
{73291}{73348}-Yoo-hoo!|-Don't move.
{73351}{73393}Tim!
{73396}{73452}Does anything in this room|strike you as odd?
{73455}{73503}-Tim?
{73506}{73555}Just a minute!
{73558}{73600}-Aaah!|-Would you just be quiet?
{73603}{73680}Coming! Lizzie!|Oh, Br-Br-Brace!
{73683}{73740}Tim!|Are you decent?
{73743}{73831}Oh, yeah! Yes, I am. What a surprise!
{73834}{73892}-Yes, now get lost!|-What did you say?
{73895}{73972}Uh, I'm lost.|I mean, 
{73975}{74023}I'm at a loss|for how beautiful you look.
{74076}{74129}Hey, hey, hey, hey-
{74190}{74243}Now, Tim, I hope you're gonna|let me make it up to you.
{74246}{74296}Oh, no, you don't have to do that.|I mean, that-
{74299}{74432}Well, you know, that's up to you.|I mean, if that's-
{74494}{74552}I brought a little peace offering.
{74555}{74605}-Where are your wine glasses?|-No, no, no-
{74608}{74677}That's the bedroom.|No glasses up there.
{74680}{74728}Oh, well,|maybe I'll get a little tour later.
{74731}{74784}- Don't miss the bathroom!|-I'm sorry?
{74787}{74836}I have to go to the bathroom later.|Later.
{74839}{74904}Um, glasses are in the kitchen.
{74907}{74956}Why don't I go get them,|and you just...
{74959}{75009}kind of make yourself at home.
{75012}{75070}Okay.
{75122}{75192}-Fantastic apartment, Tim.|-Thank you very much.
{75195}{75247}-Ah, yeah, there we go.
{75250}{75336}Oh! What a slob!
{75492}{75556}Cut it out!
{75559}{75653}-Hey!|-Yes, let's fall in love
{75656}{75705}-Ooh!|-Why shouldn't we
{75708}{75787}-Fall in love|-Mmm, that's the spot.
{75790}{75856}Let's take a chance
{75859}{75955}-Ooh, yeah. Mmm.|-Why be afraid of it, ba-ba-doo-day
{75958}{76013}-Let's close our eyes
{76016}{76085}And make our own paradise
{76088}{76209}-Little we know|-Oh, oh, no, harder, like before.
{76212}{76285}-Ahhh.|-Oh, baby
{76288}{76352}-Where's the wine?|-Uh, uh-
{76355}{76445}Why shouldn't|we fall in love
{76448}{76509}-I'll get it.|-Now is the time for it|While we are young
{76512}{76575}Let's fall in love
{76578}{76625}You know, I asked Daddy|about giving you another chance.
{76628}{76680}Oh, oh, good!
{76750}{76841}-Here we go.|-Oh, lovely. Thanks.
{76907}{76976}Hmm. You know, I thought|that crash of yours...
{76979}{77032}might make a kind of|cute little story.
{77035}{77108}-Oh, really? Good. That's-|-Mm-hmm.
{77111}{77159}Ow, ow, ow, ow.
{77162}{77224}Cut it out!
{77227}{77280}-What was that?|-Uh, I didn't hear anything.
{77283}{77364}Tim, get rid of-
{77367}{77421}Are you all right?
{77424}{77508}Yes, I just-|I really have to go to the bathroom.
{77511}{77620}-Well, hurry back.
{77623}{77697}-Why shouldn't we fall in love|-Be a minute.
{77700}{77764}-Now's the time while we're young
{77767}{77855}Tim!|Get me outta here!
{77858}{77923}Stop making all that noise!
{77926}{77996}Tell her to stop punching me!|Besides, what are you doing...
{77999}{78047}letting that female|in your apartment?
{78050}{78125}I've been waiting a long time|to get Brace Channing into my apartment.
{78128}{78196}But you like Lizzie! I could tell|through your saliva exchange.
{78199}{78264}-Excuse me?|-Look, Tim, the other night,
{78267}{78315}when you were unconscious,|Lizzie came here.
{78318}{78380}-And you what, you kissed her?|-Yes- No, no-
{78383}{78435}Well, you did.
{78438}{78485}I did a molecular|identiclone of your body.
{78488}{78548}-What? You what?|-You'd never understand.
{78551}{78597}You people think E-mail is amazing.
{78600}{78664}The point is, while I was you,
{78667}{78736}I tapped into your subconscious,|and trust me, you like Lizzie.
{78739}{78804}That's why I thought it was okay|for you to kiss her.
{78807}{78861}I-I-I didn't kiss her, you did!
{79040}{79117}Bingo!
{79120}{79243}Tim? I let myself|in the back door.
{79246}{79312}Hello?
{79315}{79416}-Oh, isn't this nice?|-Lizzie, is that you?
{79419}{79505}Oh, you look, um, nice.
{79508}{79564}He's in the bathroom,
{79567}{79624}and he's all yours.
{79627}{79679}I got what I came for.
{79780}{79856}-Oh, this is great.|-Tim!
{79859}{79935}-We don't have a lot of time here!|-I'm confused, all right?
{79938}{80004}-Everything was going along fine|until you came along.|-Don't kid yourself.
{80007}{80076}Even a substandard species|such as yours has feelings.
{80079}{80176}Just slow down for one millisecond|and look into your heart.
{80179}{80236}Whose face do you see?
{80403}{80469}Look, Brace, I think-|Lizzie!
{80499}{80572}Whoa!|Lizzie, no, wait, wait-
{80575}{80651}-No, please!|-This better be good.
{80656}{80695}Oh, it is. It is.
{80698}{80765}Uh, remember that guy|I was with at the pier yesterday?
{80768}{80842}-Your Uncle Martin.|-He's not my uncle.
{80845}{80893}He's a Martian!
{80896}{80939}-Yeah.
{80942}{81029}-You are such a jerk!|-No, no, no. He's a Martian!
{81032}{81105}It's the truth. In fact,|he's the one who kissed you, not me.
{81108}{81150}-Really?|-Yeah.
{81153}{81211}His head's in my sink right now.
{81214}{81282}-Get some sleep. You look awful.
{81285}{81361}-Lizzie-|-And if there was anything kinky|on that videotape,
{81364}{81446}you better get Brace to give it back.
{81549}{81645}Fine!|Since when did I become a mechanic?
{81648}{81733}-Do I look like overalls?
{81814}{81862}Uncle Martin!
{81865}{81931}- Okay. Don't cut the red one.
{81934}{81995}-Or was it the blue one? -Ooh!
{81998}{82071}I can't see a thing down here!
{82074}{82122}Oh, thanks.
{82197}{82250}-Ow! Geez, that hurt!
{82253}{82303}-No!
{82306}{82366}Lady, please!|Put a sock in it! Quiet!
{82369}{82415}The baby's sleeping!
{82418}{82474}Martin, I told you.|We gotta get to the...
{82477}{82525}TV station before Brace does.
{82528}{82581}- Open the bag!|-Okay, okay.
{82584}{82638}- I can't breathe!|-I'm sorry.
{82641}{82707}-Where is that confounded Zoot?|-Zoot? Uh-
{82710}{82798}Zoot! Zoot! I think he's|in the middle of a spin cycle.
{82801}{82891}Leave him! Quick, Tim!|Get my arm out of the other bag!
{82894}{82954}-All right. Okay, okay, okay.|-Okay.
{82957}{83038}-Okay.|-Yes! Excellent! Toward the ship!
{83041}{83085}-Huh? What?|-Higher! Higher! Okay, here!
{83088}{83155}Here we go! Yes!
{83158}{83219}- Easy. Oh, no!
{83222}{83309}-Oh, no! Don't send me|to the shrink!
{83312}{83354}-Ohh!
{83357}{83425}-What was that?|-Uh-oh.
{83476}{83523}Sweetie-pie,
{83526}{83574}this is the most amazing footage|I've ever seen.
{83577}{83633}Felix!|O'Hara's tapes are going on the 6:00.
{83636}{83686}-Van Gundy, call the network.|-Yeah?
{83689}{83754}Brace is going out live|with the story of the century!
{83820}{83867}I'm feeling a little carsick!
{83870}{83918}-Oh!|-Sorry.
{83985}{84070}I can't take it any more.|I can't take it any more!
{84073}{84169}-We're running out of time.|Try and pull yourself together.|-Why? We're all doomed anyway.
{84172}{84255}Without my blasted electron accelerator,|the I.S.S. will blow!
{84258}{84310}I feel like a hacksaw murderer.
{84313}{84371}What the heck is|an electron accelerator anyway?
{84374}{84446}It's a simple low-amperage power source|that activates the main thrusters.
{84449}{84539}-Oh. Kind of like an alternator?|-What's an alternator?
{84542}{84614}-It, uh, turns over the engine in a car.|- A car?
{84617}{84679}That's it! That should work!|We're saved!
{84682}{84730}-Not quite.|-Yes, we are.
{84733}{84796}-Whoo-hoo! Ha, ha, ha.|-Listen, I've been-
{84799}{84866}I've been videotaping you.|I've got everything. I got the ship.
{84869}{84944}I got Zoot.|I even got you in your Martian form.
{84947}{85011}I was putting together a story,|and I was gonna get it on the air,
{85014}{85063}-but I couldn't do it.|-Why not?
{85066}{85106}Because I like you, Martin.
{85109}{85159}I like you. I-
{85162}{85208}And I'm sorry.|I-I just- I'm sorry.
{85211}{85292}I I- I apologize.|I shouldn't have lied to you.
{85295}{85362}-You're a good human, Tim O'Hara.|-Oh, oh, yeah. I'm a terrific-
{85365}{85414}Martin!|You're back!
{85417}{85468}And I like you too.
{85471}{85534}-Oh-ho!|-I've never had feelings before!
{85537}{85582}-Oh.
{85585}{85656}Now, let's go fix my ship.
{85659}{85708}Yeah, okay- No!|No, we got a problem- the tapes.
{85711}{85794}-Brace goes on with the|Martian story in five minutes.|-Oh, blotz.
{85797}{85886}Yeah, and I got to get these tapes and|get to Brace before she gets on the air.

{90417}{90486}-Oh. It's all right.|-According to Dr Elliot Coleye,
{90489}{90570}chief biologist and head researcher|for the SETI group,

{116679}{116762}Dead or alive,|he's staying with me!
{116765}{116806}Oh. Ohh! Ohh!
{116809}{116866}Whoa! Aah!
{116869}{116950}-Martin?|-I don't understand! I- I-
{116953}{117039}Coleye, you always were a little blotz.
{117042}{117123}- What?|-Neenurt!
{117126}{117214}Ha ha ha! I haven't heard that name|in a long time.
{117217}{117320}-Pronounced properly, anyway.|-You mean it was you all along?
{117323}{117447}I can't believe this!|I should have known! You're a Martian?
{117450}{117498}I was-|Uhh! Aah!
{117734}{117819}Waaah!
{117822}{117912}-Wait. You're the one I saw at the pier.
{117915}{117954}I was trying to get to you|before they did.
{117957}{118026}I've been trying|to hitch a ride home for 30 years!
{118029}{118110}What a beauty!|Oh, by the way,
{118113}{118168}I believe these belong to you.
{118171}{118238}My antennae.
{118241}{118322}I can't go home without these. I have a|hard enough time getting dates as it is.
{118325}{118419}Mine's always giving me trouble too.|And everything's in black and white.
{118422}{118502}-And those commercials-|"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz"-
{118505}{118588}That gum lost its flavour in '66.
{118591}{118659}All right. Let's go.|Let's go. Come on.
{118662}{118736}-Got to go. Farewell.|-Come back for a visit sometime.
{118739}{118802}Maybe.
{118805}{118875}I'm beginning to see a glimmer|of potential among you Earthlings.
{118878}{118970}One word of advice: You'll never|completely advance as a culture...
{118973}{119062}until you take care of your oceans|and do away with daytime talk shows.
{119121}{119174}Goodbye, you crazy lovebirds!
{119177}{119243}Ah, stop being such|a hysterical housecoat.
{119246}{119374}-See ya, Zoot.|-Rollin', rollin', rollin'|Keep them doggies rollin'
{119413}{119495}Aliens!
{119578}{119656}Wait! No!
{119659}{119710}Please! No! You can't!
{119713}{119780}Don't go! Come back!
{119783}{119870}No-o-o!
{119937}{119967}Aah!
{119970}{120024}What the-|Eeew!
{120027}{120110}Gum. Gum!
{120113}{120190}Wait, this is the alien gum!|Yes!
{120193}{120246}Wait, wait.|I wouldn't do that if I were you.
{120249}{120324}Well, you're not me, are ya?
{120369}{120416}I can learn more about them...
{120419}{120471}from their leftover-
{120474}{120524}Wha-|That's brilliant!
{120527}{120587}I can feel every molecule of my body...
{120590}{120639}starting to change!
{120753}{120800}Aah!
{120827}{120883}Oh, no.
{120981}{121040}Hold it! Don't move!
{121043}{121122}-No!|-Stop! Don't shoot!|Get the tranquillizer gun.
{121125}{121183}No, not that, you idiots!
{121186}{121267}-I'm not a Martian.|-We got him, boys.|Get the tranquillizer gun.
{121270}{121322}We've got one-|a real live Martian!
{121325}{121423}It's me. Coleye. No! No!
{121426}{121480}Aah!
{121483}{121548}The truth is out there!
{121551}{121635}We are not leaving until they|listen to us! We've got proof!
{121638}{121714}I saw one!|He cloned my body!
{121717}{121762}He could be anywhere by now!
{121765}{121822}The truth is out there!
{121825}{121871}The truth is out there!
{121874}{121954}So that's the story here|from Santa Barbara City Hall.
{121957}{122030}-I'm Bill Randall, KGSC.|-The truth, the truth,
{122033}{122096}the truth, the truth, the truth!
{122099}{122148}It's all I-
{122241}{122351}-Hey, sleepy. Brought you some tea.
{122427}{122534}Listen, I've been thinking. Now that|I really know what happened between us,
{122537}{122614}I think maybe we should just go back|to the way things used to be.
{122617}{122650}Mmm.
{122653}{122702}Our friendship really does|mean a lot to me.
{122705}{122788}Yeah, well, I've been thinking too,|and, uh,
{122791}{122844}I think I've got enough friends.
{123482}{123596}-One giant leap for man,|one step backward for Martians.
{123599}{123678}-Zoot?|-Hey, Tim, Lizzie! We're back!
{123681}{123770}-Zoot- 
{123773}{123848}Oh! Geez!|Call a skycap, for cryin' out loud.
{123851}{123902}-What's wrong?|-Nothing.
{123905}{123982}We've decided to stay here with you.
{123985}{124076}-Y-You what?|-I kept thinking how lonely|I was gonna be without you.
{124079}{124130}And since you said|you were gonna miss me,
{124133}{124215}I thought I'd save us both|the heartache of separation.
{124218}{124267}Ya-hah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
{124270}{124384}B-B-B-But, Martin, I can't miss you|if you don't go!
{124387}{124470}Exactly!|Isn't it wonderful?
{124473}{124554}Farewell, Neenurt!
{124557}{124615}Wait a minute, wait a minute.|Where's he going?
{124618}{124682}To Mars, of course!
{124799}{124867}-Whoo! -Wh-
{124870}{124932}Martin. Martin.|What are you doing?
{124935}{125019}Tim, since we'll be living together,|let's do something about this furniture.
{125022}{125084}-Living together? What do you mean-|-I say we get rid of this couch,
{125087}{125170}and buy a hyperbolic resting chamber|like normal beings have.
{125173}{125236}-No! No! You're not staying here.|-Hey, who wants ice cream?
{125239}{125310}-Tonight I'm craving praline swirl.
{125313}{125362}-Martin- You think this is funny?
{125365}{125410}You haven't seen him eat ice cream.|It's not pretty!
{125413}{125499}Rocky road! Rocky road! Rocky road!
{125502}{125552}-Martin, you can't- He doesn't sleep.
{125555}{125602}He doesn't let me sleep.|This can't happen.
{125605}{125658}I can't have a Martian for a roommate.
{125661}{125718}I can't. I just-
{125721}{125771}-Oh, maybe I can.
{125774}{125887}Zoot! We've got cookie dough.|Want some?
{125890}{125944}Zoot.|Zoot, where are you?
{125947}{126046}Bartender, a Mai "Tide", please.
{126049}{126123}Ah, Victoria's Secret.
{126126}{126206}You people know how to live!
{126209}{126268}Lycra.
