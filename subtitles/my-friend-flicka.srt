at a profit.

168
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:57,045
They´re good horses
with good blood.

169
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:59,547
Mm-hmm, all but
that albino strain.

170
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:02,483
They got a crazy streak
in them.

171
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:05,020
No use trying to sell them.

172
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:08,387
I wouldn´t even get back
the cost of raising them.

173
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,952
I´d rather shoot them.

174
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:15,464
I would, too, if they weren´t
so doggone fast.

175
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:19,593
I hoped to get one decent colt
out of that bunch.

176
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,502
Rob...

177
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:27,440
give Ken a colt.

178
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,772
Huh?

179
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:31,279
I want you
to give Ken a colt.

180
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:34,077
After that stunt
he pulled this morning?

181
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,175
You know
he didn´t mean to.

182
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:37,685
He doesn´t deserve a colt.

183
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:39,654
Won´t you ever
give him one?

184
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:41,656
Sure. I´ve been
expecting to.

185
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:44,056
If he pays attention
to his studies--

186
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:45,389
Uh-uh.

187
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,225
No.

188
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,457
That´s another thing.

189
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:51,967
That isn´t going
to get anzwhere.

190
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:54,697
Didn´t he study today?

191
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,672
He exposed himself
to his books.

192
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,198
Good heavens. Nothing I say to him
makes any impression.

193
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:03,142
He wants his own colt.

194
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:05,306
He can´t think
of another thing.

195
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:06,814
But that´s all backwards.

196
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:09,511
You don´t bribe children
to do their duty.

197
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:11,019
It´s not a bribe.

198
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,520
What would you call it?

199
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,523
I just have a feeling...

200
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:17,583
Ken isn´t going to
pull anything off.

201
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,093
It´s time he did.

202
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:21,426
Maybe a little thing
like this...

203
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,931
would turn the trick.

204
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,432
That isn´t a little thing.

205
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,334
It isn´t easy
to break and school a colt.

206
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:30,736
I won´t have a good horse
spoiled by his carelessness.

207
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:37,038
Rob, it´s important.

208
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:39,547
He´s got to succeed
at something.

209
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,049
What he needs is--

210
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:42,550
Is to snap out of it.

211
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:45,179
If you want
to put it that way.

212
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,189
He needs to grow up.

213
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:49,851
How would having
his own colt help?

214
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:51,359
Oh, you know.

215
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,292
Something of his own...

216
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,796
responsibility.

217
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,799
He´d have something real
that he cared about...

218
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,335
more than those things
he goes mooning about.

219
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:06,904
Don´t go.

220
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:13,548
I´d like
to give Ken a colt.

221
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:16,551
I´d like to get closer
to the boy somehow...

222
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,385
but every time I get set
for a get-together session...

223
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:24,051
he hands me a facer
like what he pulled today.

224
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,561
Rob, didn´t you
ever want anything...

225
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,689
more than anything else
in the world?

226
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:34,134
Yes. You.

227
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:44,403
You do understand.

228
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,584
[Whinny]

229
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:53,722
[Whinny]

230
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:53,178
[Humming]

231
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:55,375
Where´s Ken?

232
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:58,386
Probably looking
at the ducks on the landing.

233
00:19:58,454 --> 00:20:01,389
For Pete´s sake,
what ducks on what landing?

234
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:03,322
That old print of mine.

235
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:05,827
He likes
to look at them.

236
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:09,530
Gus says Rocket
broke away last night.

237
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,328
Thinks she´s got
a colt somewhere.

238
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:13,733
We´ll have to
look for her.

239
00:20:13,803 --> 00:20:16,101
I´ll find her.

240
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:18,106
Good. I´ll go with you.

241
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:20,608
Son, I´m taking back
yesterday´s order.

242
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,111
You can forget
that hour of study.

243
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:26,979
Thanks, Dad.

244
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,111
And, Ken...

245
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:32,518
I´m going to
give you a colt.

246
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:35,781
A colt?

247
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,600
A colt of my own?

248
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:46,930
Mm-hmm.

249
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:52,540
I´ll give it to you
a week from today.

250
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:55,702
That´ll give you time
to make your own choice.

251
00:20:55,778 --> 00:20:58,212
I can have any colt
on the ranch?

252
00:20:58,281 --> 00:21:00,272
- Ayearling?
- That´s right.

253
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:07,449
Gosh.

254
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:21,061
Jeepers, maybe I can have
the one I saw yesterday.

255
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,844
Come on,
you old jughead.

256
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:34,482
Come on there.

257
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,711
Oh, come on. Come on.

258
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:39,721
Oh, step on my foot,
would you?

259
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:41,154
Come on.

260
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:49,130
Why don´t you take Highboy
for your colt?

261
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,665
That chump?

262
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,969
Don´t think I´m riding Cigarette
because I want to.

263
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:56,504
It´s because
I have to.

264
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:58,005
Then how about Lassie?

265
00:21:58,074 --> 00:22:01,475
She´s as fast as anything
and black as ink.

266
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:07,344
Who said I wanted
a black horse?

267
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,179
How about College Boy?

268
00:22:09,252 --> 00:22:11,186
He´s smart like a fox.

269
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:15,190
I´m going to pick
a filly.

270
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:17,590
I know the one
I want, too.

271
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,093
I hope I find her.

272
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:23,331
Hey, don´t do that
again, Hildy.

273
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:24,832
Cigarette´s
kind of nervous.

274
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:26,630
She might kick you.

275
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:30,069
She better don´t.
I´ll kick her back.

276
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,171
Thanks, Tim.

277
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:39,509
OK.

278
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:41,345
Ready, Ken?

279
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,611
Yes, sir.

280
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:47,689
Don´t see why
I can´t go, too.

281
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:50,191
You´re a girl.
That´s why.

282
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:51,692
Check your cinch?

283
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,023
Yes, sir.

284
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:54,653
Let´s go.

285
00:22:56,098 --> 00:22:58,532
Ken, don´t you
want your hat?

286
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:00,034
Oh, thanks, Mom.

287
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:14,310
Don´t see why
I can´t be a boy.

288
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:17,610
Even you´re a boy...

289
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,949
I guess.

290
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:41,376
Maybe you think it´s funny,
giving you a colt...

291
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,878
when you deserve
a good hiding.

292
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:45,379
Flunking all your exams...

293
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:47,382
then pulling that stunt
yesterday.

294
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:50,442
Don´t think
I´m letting you off.

295
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,781
I´m not.

296
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:53,754
I haven´t gone soft.

297
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:56,223
Don´t get that
into your head.

298
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:59,227
I expect as much now
as I ever did.

299
00:23:59,295 --> 00:24:00,728
This isn´t any reward...

300
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:03,264
because you haven´t
won any reward.

301
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:04,924
This is a partnership.

302
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:07,936
One of these days,
I´ll need your help.

303
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:11,440
You have to be trained
so you can give it.

304
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:13,441
Every man needs training.

305
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:14,806
Discipline.

306
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:17,437
I got mine at West Point.

307
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:18,775
And how.

308
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:23,150
You´re going to
train that colt.

309
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:25,653
I´ll help you
with the first breaking...

310
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:28,656
but you´ll train it,
and it´ll train you.

311
00:24:28,724 --> 00:24:29,918
Yes, sir.

312
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:33,894
You and your mother
may have to care for this ranch...

313
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,396
without me pretty soon.

314
00:24:35,464 --> 00:24:36,897
Where will you be?

315
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:40,402
I may have to go back
into the army.

316
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:41,902
You understand,
don´t you?

317
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:43,063
Yes, sir.

318
00:24:43,139 --> 00:24:45,869
You make a good pony
out of that colt...

319
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,775
and let it make
a man out of you.

320
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:49,776
Yes, sir.

321
00:24:58,454 --> 00:25:00,388
I rode all through here
yesterday.

322
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:02,390
I didn´t leave
any colts behind.

323
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,393
If Rocket had a colt,
she wouldn´t leave it.

324
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:07,395
I saw a colt yesterday...

325
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:10,398
that got separated from
the bunch in the stampede--

326
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:13,492
a sorrel filly
with a cream mane and tail.

327
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:15,002
Sounds like
Rocket´s yearling.

328
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:16,060
Rocket´s?

329
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:18,698
The filly sired by Banner
last spring.

330
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:21,106
That´s what was
wrong with Rocket--

331
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:23,111
she missed
that little filly.

332
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,911
She´d very likely console herself
with a yearling.

333
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:38,527
Should pick up a track
around here someplace.

334
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:54,269
Hey, Boss!

335
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:09,623
A cat.

336
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:12,126
That´s a mountain lion,
all right.

337
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:13,627
Ja. A big one.

338
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:16,426
Haven´t had one around here
for a long time.

339
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:20,435
Good thing we got
the brood mares out of here.

340
00:26:20,503 --> 00:26:23,063
Maybe we better
look around that cave.

341
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:10,918
Well, it got
one of them.

342
00:27:10,986 --> 00:27:12,248
It´s dark brown.

343
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:13,913
It´s Rocket´s, I guess.

344
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:15,923
Tim was right.
She had one.

345
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:18,084
Didn´t she know
it was dead?

346
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,752
Yes and no.

347
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:21,763
Mares are funny
about death.

348
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:23,594
They´ll leave
a dead foal...

349
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,930
then remember it
and hunt for it.

350
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:28,435
Will the mountain lion
get any other horses?

351
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:32,099
Not now, Kenny.
They´re all out on the range.

352
00:27:32,174 --> 00:27:34,938
Can´t he get
the horse and colts there?

353
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,944
Not where there´s
no cover.

354
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:38,946
Their only chance
is surprise.

355
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:41,949
If a horse is off
by itself...

356
00:27:42,017 --> 00:27:45,214
a lion will jump on it,
bite through the spine.

357
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:46,447
Quick kill.

358
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:47,921
[Whinny]

359
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:09,743
It´s Rocket.

360
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,473
And her filly.

361
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:34,869
What a pretty
little flicka she is.

362
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:36,427
Flicka<
What does that mean?

Swedish for ::little girl.´´

364
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:47,946
Flicka. That´s
what I´ll call her.

365
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:48,949
My colt.

366
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,451
Your colt?

367
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,546
Yes, sir.
That´s the one I want.

368
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,282
Rocket´s filly, Ken?

369
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,452
Yes, sir.

370
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:04,564
I hoped you´d make
a wiser choice.

371
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,567
You know how I feel...

372
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:08,227
about Rocket´s
line of horses.

373
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:10,568
But she´s fast.
Rocket´s fast, too.

374
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:12,072
They´re my worst horses.

375
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:15,668
There´s not one among them
with any real sense.

376
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,914
The mares are hellions,
the stallions outlaws.

377
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:21,915
They´re untamable.

378
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:24,418
I´ll tame her.

379
00:29:24,486 --> 00:29:27,922
Nobody´s ever been able
to tame a one of them.

380
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,925
You want a horse
that´ll be a friend?

381
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:31,925
Yes, sir.

382
00:29:31,994 --> 00:29:34,588
You´ll never make
a friend of her.

383
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:37,427
Look what they did
to get back together.

384
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:41,492
No fence in the world
will ever hold them.

385
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,504
You better
change your mind.

386
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:44,884
No.

387
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:50,822
OK, Ken. I promised you could
make your own choice.

388
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,551
But remember--
Rocket´s loco...

389
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,321
and 1 0-to-1
the colt is, too.

390
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:58,830
But she may not be.
Banner´s her father.

391
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,195
All right.

392
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:03,758
We´ll bring her in
tomorrow or the next day.

393
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:33,031
It´s silly
to write horses´ names on things.

394
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,532
Horses can´t read.

395
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,795
People can read.

396
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,359
But Pop can´t.

397
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,702
Besides, you ain´t even
got a horse yet.

398

What do you mean
I haven´t got a horse?

Well, it ain´t here.

That´s Mr. Sergent.
He´s got lots of race horses.

He´s got
a fat belly, too.

405

Hey, Gus,
is Rob around?

Swell.

Glad to see you.
Sit down.

413

Rob, I´m shipping a carload of horses
to Los Angeles.

414
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:20,337
Maybe you´d like
to go in on the deal...

415
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,176
and share
the shipping expenses.

416
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:23,681

417

There´s room in the car
for four more horses.

Flicka´s loco...

420
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,724

Don´t say that, Hildy.

Well, ain´t her fault.

423
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:40,264
She can´t help it
if her mom´s crazy, can she?

424

Banner´s got sense.

425
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,562
She could be like her father,
couldn´t she?

When I do
something dumb...

anything like Rocket.

491
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:30,409
Get in there.

492
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,708
Shut the gate.

493
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,753
Get the truck.

494
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:49,967
Whoa. That´s it.

495
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:17,418
Sergent expects her
in good shape.

496
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:20,488
Try not
to skin her up.

497
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:22,830
Get her out of here.

498
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:36,447
Well, that´s that.

499
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,449
You mean that´s $500.

500
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,611
It´ll come in mighty handy,
won´t it?

501
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,325
Dad, look!

502
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,732
Oh, Rob.

503
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,511
That finished her.

504
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:21,050
Well?

505
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,617
She´s dead.

506
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,128
Poor old Rocket.

507
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,927
It´s too bad,
but these things will happen.

508
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,867
Just takes little lick
to kill horse.

509
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:37,441
There´s one thing
I can still do.

510
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,399
Hello, Williams?
This is McLaughlin.

511
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,900
OK. Thanks.

512
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:07,905
Look, Williams, I got
a load of horses for you.

513
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,406
Yeah, those albinos.

514
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:12,910
Yep. Every one of them,
Rocket´s whole tribe.

515
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:16,914
There should be some good
horseflesh among them.

516
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:22,249
All right, your own price.
Good.

517
00:40:22,321 --> 00:40:25,017
Yep.
There are nine of them.

518
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:29,927
Wait a minute.
There may be 1 0.

519
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:31,428
Ken, come here.

520
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:39,101
Here´s a chance to do
a sensible thing.

521
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:42,106
I want you to choose
another colt...

522
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:45,109
and let me sell Flicka
to Mr. Williams.

523
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:50,072
I´m asking for your sake
as well as mine.

524
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:53,379
What´s the use having
another Rocket?

525
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:55,044
You saw what happened.

526
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,054
I´m going to
tame Flicka.

527
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,384
That´s impossible.

528
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:00,721
Sometimes bad horses
get tamed.

529
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,386
You don´t want
a loco horse, do you?

530
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:04,895
I want Flicka.

531
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,396
Look at me.

532
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,899
Dad, please.
She´s mine.

533
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,568
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Williams.

534
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,073
I thought
there was one more.

535
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,076
No. There are only nine.

536
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,907
Right.
I´ll send them over.

537
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,911
So long.

538
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:12,495
Haw!

539
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:13,792
Haw!

540

Git!

541
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,170
Well, that´s that.

542
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:21,671
Sure is a wild one.

543
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,867
We´ll let her
think it over.

544
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:39,450
She´ll go right through
that wire.

545
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:40,684
She´ll never go over.

546
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:45,829
It turned her.

547
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,229
Dad, she has got sense.

548
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,466
Flicka!

549
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,475
I knew it,
that crazy--

550
00:42:58,543 --> 00:42:59,510
Rob, hurry!

551
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:08,652
Whoa, whoa!

552
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,652
Whoa.

553
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,655
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

554
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,918
There now.

555
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:28,103
Don´t think she´ll
pull out of it.

556
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,242
Maybe it´s
just as well.

557
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,177
Hadn´t been this way,
it would´ve been another.

558
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:37,875
A loco horse
isn´t worth the bullet...

559
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,213
it takes to shoot it.

560
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:43,278
Now easy, girl.

561
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:49,751
Flicka.

562
00:44:21,102 --> 00:44:24,037
Eat your dinner,
Kenny.

563
00:44:24,105 --> 00:44:26,096
Do I have to, Mom?

564
00:44:26,174 --> 00:44:29,075
You heard
what your mother said.

565
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:30,543
Flicka, she´s--

566
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:32,239
Let him go to her.

567
00:44:32,314 --> 00:44:34,544
He can´t do her
any good.

568
00:44:34,616 --> 00:44:36,982
Gus and Tim
dressed her cuts.

569
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:40,249
She snaps out of it,
she´s got water and oats.

570
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:12,520
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t
mean to hurt you.

571
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:15,522
Get well.

572
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,683
Please be all right.

573
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,624
Gee, she was pretty.

574
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:29,033
What do you mean ::was´´?

575
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:30,366
She is.

576
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:33,031
She´s beautiful.

577
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:37,340
I meant when she was
running back there.

578
00:45:44,052 --> 00:45:46,384
Say, Ken.

579
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:48,479
Tomorrow, if you want
to take care of her...

580
00:45:48,556 --> 00:45:50,649
I´ll do your work
for you.

581
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:54,661
Would you, Hildy?
Gee, that´d be keen.

582
00:45:54,729 --> 00:45:56,993
Sure.
I´ll exercise Cigarette...

583
00:45:57,065 --> 00:46:00,000
bring in the wood,
and dry the dishes.

584
00:46:00,068 --> 00:46:02,832
You can stay with Flicka
all the time...

585
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:04,496
except when
you´re sleeping.

586
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:06,506
Thanks, Hildy.

Gus, she´s going
to be all right, isn´t she?

00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:02,962
Pretty good chance...

591
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:05,056
if we could get her
to eat.

592
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:21,811
Maybe she
don´t like oats.

593
00:47:24,552 --> 00:47:26,486
I´ll get her
some hay.

Whoa.

595
00:47:50,512 --> 00:47:52,946
Don´t run away, Flicka.

Don´t be afraid of me.
I´m Ken.

597
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:01,251
This is hay.
You´ll like it.

598
00:48:01,322 --> 00:48:02,482
Have some.

599
00:48:02,557 --> 00:48:05,526
Take it easy.
She´s been scared pretty bad.

600
00:48:32,987 --> 00:48:35,956
She´s eating.
She´s going to get well.

601
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:37,651
Ja.
It´s good sign.

602
00:48:57,879 --> 00:49:00,313
Move her
to the calf pasture.

603
00:49:00,381 --> 00:49:02,975
There´s shade there
and a running stream.

604
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:04,518
And she´ll be alone.

605
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:06,076
I thought horses
like company.

606
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:08,816
Not her.
She´s a lone wolf.

607
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,656
She might jump out
of the calf pasture and get away.

608
00:49:12,727 --> 00:49:14,991
She won´t jump out.

609
00:49:15,063 --> 00:49:17,827
She won´t jump anything
for a long time.

The cuts are
all healed up...

all your time.

Well, not too close.

look at her...

It´s almost well.

655
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:32,023
She´s beautiful.

656
00:51:35,403 --> 00:51:36,335
Dad?

657
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:40,072
Do you think she´s...

658
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:41,233
loco?

659
00:51:41,309 --> 00:51:44,073
I´d have sworn it
by the way she´s behaved...

660
00:51:44,145 --> 00:51:45,908
ever since
she was born.

661
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,073
In fact,
we´ve never seen her...

662
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:49,912
except when she´s
looked terrified.

663
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:52,418
Every horse looks
wild in the eye...

664
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:53,749
when it´s terrified.

665
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:55,584
She tried jumping
that fence.

666
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:57,749
Anyone can try
the impossible once.

667

::It couldn´t be done...

did it anzway.´´

Maybe Flicka thought
she could do it.

We´ll forgive her
that one.

672
00:52:10,338 --> 00:52:12,272
Point is,
will she learn?

673
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,604
Can she learn?

674
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:16,870
Rocket couldn´t.
Or wouldn´t.

675
00:52:16,944 --> 00:52:20,744
Dad, maybe I´ll never
get her trained.

676
00:52:20,815 --> 00:52:23,215
Heavens, Son,
what have I been telling you...

677
00:52:23,284 --> 00:52:24,717
all these weeks?

678
00:52:24,786 --> 00:52:26,219
Didn´t you understand?

679
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:28,949
What did you think
loco meant?

680
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:31,719
Sort of goofy or wild--
hard to handle.

681
00:52:31,793 --> 00:52:34,523
Oh, no, Son.
Much more serious than that.

682
00:52:34,595 --> 00:52:36,529
There´s inherited insanity
among animals...

683
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:39,031
just as there is
among humans.

684
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,533
Bad blood carries on...

685
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:44,037
and albino blood isn´t safe
for any filly to have.

686
00:52:44,105 --> 00:52:45,402
But you said...

687
00:52:45,473 --> 00:52:48,067
maybe it´s just because
she´s been scared.

688
00:52:57,685 --> 00:53:00,119
She´s got
a very intelligent face.

689
00:53:00,188 --> 00:53:01,917
Much better
than Rocket´s.

690
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:04,624
Fine, delicate mouth.

691
00:53:04,692 --> 00:53:06,125
And such lovely eyes.

692
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:07,957
Mm-hmm.
Set far apart.

693
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:10,657
We´ll have to see
how she responds to training.

694
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:12,665
How can I train her?

695
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:16,066
All you can do
is try and win her confidence.

696
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:21,575
You know, Son,
if you take everything away...

697
00:53:21,642 --> 00:53:23,473
from a living creature--

698

Oh, I will, Dad.
I will.

Talk to her.

00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:25,803
The filly
sure did the trick.

818
00:59:25,872 --> 00:59:27,305
He´s a changed boy.

Flicka, I´ve got
something for you!

821
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,583
Look. Brand-new
saddle blanket.

822
00:59:42,655 --> 00:59:44,145
Tailor-made
especially for you.

823
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,191
Isn´t it keen?

824
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,490
When you grow up,
we´ll put it on you.

825
00:59:49,562 --> 00:59:52,497
Won´t even know you´ve
got a saddle on your back.

826
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:54,032
We´ll go riding
on the range...

827
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,068
fly like the wind.

828
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:58,302
Look.

829
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:00,236
Got your name on it.

830
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,648
Oh, Flicka, I didn´t
mean to scare you.

831
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,051
Honest, I didn´t.

Come back, Flicka.
Oh, please come back.

You don´t have
to have it.

834

I won´t ever ride you...

835
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:28,660
or put a saddle on you...

836
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:30,635
if you don´t
want me to.

837

my friend.

anything terribly?

Most everyone

Yeah, I wonder.

Maybe sometimes,
for a minute or two.

What is it
you want now, Ken?

855
01:01:35,568 --> 01:01:39,937
I do so want Flicka
to be all right and not loco.

Oh, perhaps she
isn´t loco, dear.

wanting won´t change it.

860

If she is, it´ll look bad
for her, won´t it?

861
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:55,478
Let´s see what happens
when we try to halter-break her.

862
01:01:55,555 --> 01:01:56,988
Does she have to be?

We´ve got to find out,
don´t we?

864
01:01:59,225 --> 01:02:00,317
I suppose so.

865
01:02:00,393 --> 01:02:02,827
As soon as she´ll
let you touch her...

866

we´ll have a try at it.

What if she
won´t let us?

868

She loves you,
doesn´t she?

Oh, yes.
I´m sure she does.

Well, that shows
she´s intelligent.

How does it, Mom?

872
01:02:15,908 --> 01:02:18,775
It´s just a way
of putting away fear.

Don´t you understand,
Ken...

874
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:24,949
that if you find love...

875
01:02:25,017 --> 01:02:27,952
if a person or an animal
finds love...

876
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,454
it´s the same
as finding safety.

877
01:02:30,523 --> 01:02:32,957
It´s comfort and
friendliness and help.

Everyone longs for it.

And if Flicka´s
found it...

01:02:36,529 --> 01:02:38,963
and yet doesn´t have
sense enough...

881

to know she´s found it...

882
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:43,627
and goes around being crazy
and silly with fear, then--

883
01:02:43,703 --> 01:02:45,671

01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:18,796
Ja, I think
you better.

978
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:57,933
She has got sense,
hasn´t she, Mom?

979
01:09:58,003 --> 01:10:00,437
She knows we´re helping her,
doesn´t she?

980
01:10:00,506 --> 01:10:03,270
Of course she does.
She´s a good little girl...

981
01:10:03,342 --> 01:10:06,277
and we´ll get her out of this
in no time.

982
01:10:18,023 --> 01:10:19,456
Slack off!.

983
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:25,829
Rip it!

984
01:10:29,468 --> 01:10:31,993
Dad, I´d like
to talk to you.

985
01:10:32,071 --> 01:10:33,038
What about?

986
01:10:33,105 --> 01:10:34,163
About Flicka.

987
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,231
For the love of Mike,
can´t you see I´m busy?

988
01:10:37,309 --> 01:10:39,209
Can´t be worrying
about that filly.

989
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:45,907
I´m sorry, Dad.

990
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:50,888
Just a minute, Ken.

991
01:10:55,928 --> 01:10:57,327
What is it, Son?

992
01:10:57,396 --> 01:10:58,328
Flicka worse?

993
01:10:58,397 --> 01:10:59,830
Dad, she´s so sick.

994
01:10:59,898 --> 01:11:02,332
Will you come down
and see her?

995
01:11:02,401 --> 01:11:04,835
Maybe you can
do something to help her.

996
01:11:04,903 --> 01:11:08,168
All right. I´ll come
have a look at her.

997
01:11:14,913 --> 01:11:16,346
She´s lying down again.

998
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:22,353
Good heavens.
What´s happened to her?

999
01:11:22,421 --> 01:11:25,185
She´s been getting
awfully thin.

1000
01:11:25,257 --> 01:11:26,383
Thin!

1001
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:28,858
I´m afraid she ain´t
going to pull out of it.

1002
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:31,361
Pull out of it?
She´s dead already.

1003
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,330
How long´s she been
like this?

1004
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:35,867
She´s been real sick
the last few days.

1005
01:11:35,934 --> 01:11:38,698
It´s the fever.
It´s burning her up.

1006
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:52,883
She´s going to die.

1007
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:55,317
We´ll have to put her
out of her misery.

1008
01:11:55,387 --> 01:11:56,649
Oh, no, Dad.

1009
01:11:56,722 --> 01:11:57,984
I´m sorry, Ken.

1010
01:11:58,056 --> 01:12:00,149
It isn´t fair
to an animal...

1011
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:02,489
to let it suffer
like this.

1012
01:12:10,903 --> 01:12:13,838
Pick a time when
Ken isn´t around.

1013
01:13:00,385 --> 01:13:01,317
Gus!

1014
01:13:05,891 --> 01:13:09,019
Gus, when are you
going to do it?

1015
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:13,827
I was--I was going
down soon now, Kenny.

1016
01:13:13,899 --> 01:13:15,332
Don´t do it tonight.

1017
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,833
Wait till morning.

1018
01:13:16,902 --> 01:13:18,335
Just one more night.

1019
01:13:19,404 --> 01:13:20,336
Gus.

1020
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:24,672
Well, in the morning,
then.

1021
01:13:24,743 --> 01:13:27,974
It´s got to be done.
Your father gave the orders.

1022
01:13:28,046 --> 01:13:31,675
I know. I won´t say
anything more.

1023
01:14:41,749 --> 01:14:42,841
[Dog Barks]

1024
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:44,144
Shhh.

1025
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,420
I´m coming, Flicka.

1026
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:49,922
I´m coming.

1027
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,330
Flicka?

1028
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,437
Flicka, where are you?

1029
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:34,530
Oh, my little Flicka.

1030
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:00,753
Give him one of these
every hour.

1031
01:17:00,821 --> 01:17:02,948
I´ll call to see him
tomorrow morning.

1032
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:15,101
He´s a very sick boy.

1033
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:17,103
It isn´t only
the cold and fever--

1034
01:17:17,171 --> 01:17:18,968
He had a shock,
Dr. Scott.

1035
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,006
Something happened--

1036
01:17:20,073 --> 01:17:22,974
He´s been sad about
a horse I gave him.

1037
01:17:23,043 --> 01:17:24,169
It´s been sick.

1038
01:17:24,244 --> 01:17:26,371
Oh, I see.

1039
01:17:26,447 --> 01:17:31,111
Well, you´d better have this
prescription filled right away.

1040
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:33,119
I´ll follow you
into town...

1041
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:35,052
and bring it
right back.

1042
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:36,054
Don´t worry.

1043
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:54,106
How is the little boy,
Missus?

1044
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:55,607
Gus, he´s so sick.

1045
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:57,906
Poor little boy.

1046
01:17:57,978 --> 01:17:59,468
[Thunder]

1047
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:03,809
Gus, is Flicka dead?

1048
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:08,548
No. Tim and me fixed her up
in a blanket sling.

1049
01:18:08,622 --> 01:18:10,055
She can´t stand alone...

1050
01:18:10,123 --> 01:18:12,057
but she drank
a bucket of water.

1051
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:15,060
Did Rob say you didn´t
have to shoot her?

1052
01:18:15,128 --> 01:18:17,562
No, but I
couldn´t do it.

1053
01:18:17,631 --> 01:18:22,125
When I found them
like that this morning, I--

1054
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,136
I know what you mean.

1055
01:18:24,204 --> 01:18:26,138
She´s got plenty
of strength.

1056
01:18:26,206 --> 01:18:29,869
Sometimes I think, Gus,
miracles can still happen.

1057
01:18:29,943 --> 01:18:32,878
It was the water
washing the fever out of her...

1058
01:18:32,946 --> 01:18:36,382
but it was Ken
giving her courage.

1059
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:39,248
All night that little fella
sitting by her...

1060
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:41,014
saying, ::Hold on, Flicka.

1061
01:18:41,088 --> 01:18:42,521
::I´m here with you.

1062
01:18:42,589 --> 01:18:44,352
The two of us together.´´

1063
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:48,093
I´ll tell Ken.

1064
01:18:48,161 --> 01:18:51,096
Maybe it will
help him get well...

1065
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:52,893
knowing she´s still alive.

1066
01:18:54,935 --> 01:18:56,869
There´s a storm
coming up, Missus.

1067
01:18:56,937 --> 01:18:59,201
I´ll stay here
if you need me.

1068
01:18:59,273 --> 01:19:00,706
Thank you, Gus.

1069
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:03,742
[Thunder]

1070
01:19:37,411 --> 01:19:39,504
I thought you´d
never get here.

1071
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,013
How is he?

1072
01:19:41,081 --> 01:19:42,514
Better. He´s been resting.

1073
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:45,017
Good. We need
some hot water.

1074
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:53,092
Did you do
as I told you?

1075
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,593
Boss, I couldn´t.

1076
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,687
I gave the order,
and you´ve had plenty of time.

1077
01:19:57,764 --> 01:19:59,322
I just couldn´t do it.

1078
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:00,832
Where´s the rifle?

1079
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:02,334
In the bunkhouse.

1080
01:20:02,402 --> 01:20:03,835
Go get it.

1081
01:20:11,044 --> 01:20:12,477
Oh, Rob, please don´t.

1082
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:13,979
He knows she´s alive.

1083
01:20:14,047 --> 01:20:15,981
He thinks she´ll get well.

1084
01:20:16,049 --> 01:20:18,483
Give him something
to hope for.

[Thunder]

1086
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:32,126
Would have been better
if she were shot weeks ago.

01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:34,599
It´s been nothing
but misery for everyone.

1088

Look what it´s done
to Ken.

1089

I wish you wouldn´t, Rob.

1090
01:20:38,672 --> 01:20:39,604
He needn´t know.

1091
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:40,901
He´ll hear the shot.

1092
01:20:40,974 --> 01:20:42,407
He´ll think it´s thunder.

1093
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:44,171
He´ll know
it´s the rifle.

I´m sorry, but...

1095
01:20:47,314 --> 01:20:50,340
it´s just no good
letting sick animals live.

01:23:24,704 --> 01:23:26,137
I heard a shot.

1122
01:23:26,206 --> 01:23:27,639
It was a mountain lion.

01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:29,140
Did you get him?

1124

I will before morning.

she´ll have to do it by herself.

1128
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:52,224
How´d he take it?

1129
01:23:52,299 --> 01:23:53,732
Well, he took it.

1130
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:58,396
He didn´t question it,

don´t tell him

She may be dead
by morning.

1135

If he knows she´s still alive,
he´ll be all upset again.

1138
01:24:24,598 --> 01:24:26,031
I won´t tell him.

1139
01:25:04,804 --> 01:25:05,998
[Nickers]

1140
01:25:06,072 --> 01:25:07,471
[Whinny]

1141
01:25:53,954 --> 01:25:55,353
Thanks, Flicka.

1142
01:25:56,423 --> 01:25:57,685
[Whinny]

1143
01:26:09,045 --> 01:26:10,273
Morning, Dad.

1144
01:26:12,082 --> 01:26:14,016
How do you feel
this morning?

1145
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:15,517
Much better, thanks.

1146
01:26:15,585 --> 01:26:19,021
Enough better to go out
in the warm sunshine?

1147
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:23,388
I guess so.

1148
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,893
It´s doctor´s orders.

1149
01:26:24,961 --> 01:26:27,896
Come on. I´ll help you
get dressed.

1150
01:26:54,724 --> 01:26:57,591
Dad...where are we going?

1151
01:26:59,129 --> 01:27:00,687
The calf pasture.

1152
01:27:00,764 --> 01:27:02,197
That´s right, Son.

1153
01:27:19,082 --> 01:27:21,107
[Whinny]

1154
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:28,255
Flicka.

1155
01:27:29,659 --> 01:27:31,718
It is Flicka.

1156
01:27:31,795 --> 01:27:33,456
But I thought--

1157
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:36,897
I didn´t shoot her.
I couldn´t.

1158
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:38,400
That shot you heard?

1159
01:27:38,468 --> 01:27:40,402
That was
the mountain lion.

1160
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:42,165
I killed him.

1161
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:43,796
Ohh.

1162
01:27:43,873 --> 01:27:46,273
Ohh.

1163
01:27:46,343 --> 01:27:47,605
Easy, Ken.

1164
01:27:47,677 --> 01:27:49,076
[Whinny]

1165
01:27:56,286 --> 01:27:57,480
Flicka.

1166
01:27:58,755 --> 01:28:00,916
[Whinny]

1167
01:28:05,328 --> 01:28:07,023
Oh, Flicka.

1168
01:28:18,308 --> 01:28:21,141
She did get gentle,
didn´t she, Dad?

1169
01:28:21,211 --> 01:28:23,202
Gentle as a kitten.

1170
01:28:25,048 --> 01:28:27,516
She´s given us
a lot of trouble, Son...

1171
01:28:27,584 --> 01:28:30,451
but she´s taught us some
important things, too.

1172
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:33,853
You, responsibility.

1173
01:28:35,191 --> 01:28:40,288
Me, there is such a thing
as hope beyond hope.

1174
01:28:40,363 --> 01:28:43,799
That sometimes, when things
are at their lowest ebb...

1175
01:28:43,867 --> 01:28:47,803
all we need do is have
a little more love...

1176
01:28:47,871 --> 01:28:51,329
a little more patience,
and a little more faith.

1177
01:28:52,305 --> 01:28:58,932
