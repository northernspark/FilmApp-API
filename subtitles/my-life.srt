2
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,846
"Star light, star bright.

3
00:01:55,848 --> 00:01:57,681
"First star I see tonight.

4
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:00,116
"I wish I may, I wish I might.

5
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,785
"Have the wish I wish tonight."

6
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,953
Dear, God, please, please,

7
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:09,958
I wish for there to be a circus in
my backyard tomorrow afternoon,

8
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,626
when I come home from school.

9
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:13,861
Not a fake circus,
a real circus,

10
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:17,064
with clowns and acrobats
and everything.

11
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,533
If you do this,
I'll tell everybody.

12
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:23,069
You'll be on television and
you'll be in the newspapers.

13
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:25,204
And you'll get
more money for church.

14
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:28,974
Please, God, please.
Make this come true.

15
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:37,749
All right now, children,
I want you to tear a page

16
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:38,583
neatly out of your notebooks,

17
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:42,353
and copy the address down just as
Bobbie's writing it here on the board.

18
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:45,055
All right? Oh, isn't
this exciting?

19
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:47,991
How many children have
relatives in the circus?

20
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:50,493
I bet your regular teacher
wishes she was here today.

21
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:56,065
And there's gonna be clowns, a
trapeze and horses and everything.

22
00:02:56,067 --> 00:03:00,135
All in your backyard. Hmph!
Isn't that thrilling?

23
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:03,204
Yeah. And everybody
from school gets in free.

24
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:04,338
Oh, that's nice.

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,141
Now, children, I want you to be sure
and write down the time, all right?

26
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:10,710
It's 3:30. Can you write that?

27
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,052
Hey, hey, son!

28
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:35,331
Are we going to see
the surprise?

29
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,877
What is this circus?

30
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,146
Where is the circus?
I don't know.

31
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:58,251
But it was supposed to be here.
It was supposed to come.

32
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:50,135
Hi. My name is Bob...

33
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:51,736
Oh, shit.

34
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,410
Hmm.

35
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,212
Okay.

36
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:07,347
Hi. My name is Bob Jones.

37
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,151
I was born in Detroit,
Michigan in 19... Damn!

38
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,056
Okay.

39
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:20,691
My, uh, my name...

40
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:24,394
I am, uh...

41
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:27,396
Bob Jones. Robert Jones.

42
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,433
Formerly Bobbie Jones.

43
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,234
Formerly,

44
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:37,804
Bobbie Ivanovich, actually.

45
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:39,772
I am, uh...

46
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:44,943
Those are my... This... That's who...
Oh, I hate this.

47
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,711
Okay, look. I'm just
gonna do this, okay?

48
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:53,117
Sorry if it doesn't all make sense, but, uh,
I may not have a lot of time here, so...

49
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,252
The fact is,

50
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,787
I'm supposed to be dying.

51
00:05:58,122 --> 00:05:59,421
Um, I've got a disease
called cancer.

52
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,889
There are a lot of
different kinds of cancer.

53
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:03,224
Mine started in my kidneys,
spread to my lungs.

54
00:06:03,226 --> 00:06:04,692
Now, I have a doctor,
nice enough guy,

55
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:09,763
says, uh, we're gonna try all
kinds of experimental therapies.

56
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:12,365
But the truth is he really
doesn't think I'm gonna make it.

57
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:18,637
I plan to prove him wrong. Now the
tricky part here is not that, uh,

58
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,974
I'm supposed to be dying,
but that, uh,

59
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,308
you're about to be born.

60
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,511
Okay? Here are some facts.

61
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,446
We all die.

62
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,948
Not pleasant, but we do.
It happens.

63
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,549
I could get hit
by a truck tomorrow.

64
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,350
Hopefully not a large truck.

65
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:38,719
I could, uh, be sleeping,

66
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:42,222
palm tree crashes through
the bedroom ceiling, kills me.

67
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:42,889
It's over. Could happen.

68
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:45,558
If something like that did happen,
it would really be a drag

69
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,163
because there are a lot of things
I wanna tell you and say to you.

70
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,764
Uh...

71
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,702
There's not a lot you can trust in this world.
There just isn't.

72
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:04,339
So I wanted to leave
you this videotape,

73
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,909
for better
or for worse, so that

74
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:12,580
you know something
about me, who I am.

75
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,115
Well, this is me.

76
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:20,587
Came into the world weighing 8
pounds, 9 ounces, 21 inches tall.

77
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:23,489
Eyes, blue. Hair, none.

78
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,925
Uh, let's... Look at this.

79
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:29,693
Oh, my goodness.

80
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:32,261
Look at this.

81
00:07:32,263 --> 00:07:35,864
It's amazing.
How is that possible?

82
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:39,934
Who the heck is this guy? He looks
like a loose kind of guy, doesn't he?

83
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:44,505
One of the members of the family who just
got out of a mental institution, I think.

84
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:48,475
Mmm, look at this. Looks
like the meat packers union.

85
00:07:48,977 --> 00:07:52,311
None of these people will ever
become a member of a dance troupe.

86
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:53,879
You can bet on that.

87
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:57,082
Oh. Here's a picture
of me and my mom, Rose.

88
00:07:57,084 --> 00:08:00,318
She said there were 12 tornadoes
in Detroit the day I was born.

89
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,154
Twelve tornadoes.
Four people died.

90
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:07,158
She always said
I was a natural disaster.

91
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,461
Oh, here you go. This is my dad.
Take note of that.

92
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:15,799
It's one of the few pictures
you'll see of my dad awake.

93
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:17,266
See what I mean? Look there.

94
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:22,170
To get my dad off the couch, you had
to say the sale light was on at Kmart.

95
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,843
Okay. These primitive
life forms you see here

96
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:34,013
are, uh, your relatives, actually,
grazing and foraging in Detroit.

97
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:39,251
They still live there, so the chance
of you seeing them are pretty slim.

98
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,621
I think it's important for you
to see this so that you realize,

99
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:47,058
you know, who you are isn't
necessarily all your fault.

100
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,926
You can blame it
on the gene pool.

101
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,994
Here's your grandfather
lightin' up a smoke.

102
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:55,965
Oh, there's me and your Uncle
Paul, my brother and your uncle.

103
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:58,334
As you can tell
from these movies,

104
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:02,905
the chances of a Nike contract
in your future are slim.

105
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,606
Sorry.

106
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:07,975
Oh, my Uncle Marco used to
pack us in his station wagon,

107
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:09,142
take us all these places.

108
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:11,544
And, uh, we used to go to this
place, this amusement park.

109
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:14,580
That was called the Screamer,
right there, that roller coaster.

110
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:16,481
And my Uncle Marco
thought it was a good idea

111
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:20,685
to put me on this thing and said
I was gonna have a lot of fun.

112
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:24,388
Stupidest thing I ever did.
Thought I was gonna die.

113
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,457
That's where I first learned
the meaning of the word fear.

114
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:31,127
First and last roller coaster ride
you're lookin' at right there.

115
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:35,564
Here's another shot of your Uncle Paul.
He used to be a schoolteacher, Paul.

116
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:40,368
Taught social studies. Now he
works for my dad, junk dealer.

117
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,803
We don't talk too much anymore.
I hate these things.

118
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:47,040
I hate other people's home movies.
I hate my own home movies.

119
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:50,643
And I always did.

120
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,857
Eleanor called today.

121
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:08,827
She wanted to know if I'd be
treasurer again this year.

122
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:11,596
What'd you say?

123
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:17,535
What could I say? "I can't. I'm going
fishing for the next 150 years."

124
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:20,303
Very funny.

125
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:25,308
You know, it's something we're
gonna have to tell people.

126
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,012
Yeah. Don't forget to tell
me when that is, okay?

127
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:33,615
Amazing, isn't it?

128
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:37,718
There's just no appropriate
etiquette for this.

129
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,255
Yeah, you'd think Hallmark would
have come up with something by now.

130
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:46,392
You know, "Due to an
unexpected terminal illness,

131
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:49,762
"Bob Jones regrets
to inform you..."

132
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:52,664
Or you can leave it
on your answering machine.

133
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,832
"Hi, this is Bob Jones.
I'm dead right now.

134
00:10:54,834 --> 00:11:00,270
"But if you leave your name, number
and time that you called..."

135
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:10,145
Here.

136
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:13,814
Water. I hate this.

137
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:18,584
Oh, I hate this.

138
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,185
Hey.

139
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,762
Son of a bitch.

140
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:34,997
This is ridiculous.

141
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,166
I don't have time for this.

142
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:40,366
Okay.

143
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:44,269
Call her up. Tell Cynthia we got
her a spot on the <i> Today Show.</i>

144
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:44,969
Yeah. She'll be happy.

145
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,638
They're gonna do it at her house.
Yeah. Hey, you know what?

146
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,409
Tell her to do something with that kitchen.
Rent some groceries or something.

147
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,810
Yeah. Okay. Hold on a minute.

148
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:56,079
Got any messages for the office?
Mmm-mmm.

149
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,548
All right, see you in a minute.

150
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:04,320
Hey. Equal time. Now can we talk for a minute?
This is important.

151
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:09,758
I spoke with Robin yesterday
about that Chinese healer.

152
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,593
Don't give me that look.
He helped her father.

153
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:13,328
Oh, hon, a healer. Come on.

154
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,298
I may have cancer,
but it's not in my brain.

155
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,399
Besides, you know what they
say about Chinese healers.

156
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:25,304
They heal you. You feel fine. Half hour
later, you need to be healed again.

157
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,674
Hon, listen to me.

158
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:34,345
Eight percent of all people on
Interleukin-2 have total remission.

159
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:36,847
Survival for people
on laetrile is around 6%.

160
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:41,585
I figure if you add up all the percentages
of all the things I'm trying,

161
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:46,289
I've got about a 122%
chance of survival here.

162
00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:50,526
Come on. Don't give up
hope on me, babe.

163
00:12:54,298 --> 00:12:55,363
Okay, um,

164
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,932
tell George to go over to Oshman's
and pick up some baseball bats,

165
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:03,003
gloves and t-shirts and balls and stuff
and send 'em over to Randy Spikes.

166
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:05,505
Tell him to get his kid
in little league.

167
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:07,273
We'll worry about
the contracts later.

168
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,007
That's so sweet.

169
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,610
Yeah, I'm a wonderful human being.
All right, what next? Uh, telegram.

170
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:18,216
Hey! George, come on in. Gimme a
minute, would you? Get the door.

171
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:19,883
Thanks.

172
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:22,218
Hey, how'd it go?
You finish it up?

173
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,452
It's not gonna work, Mr. Jones.

174
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:26,354
It's just not happening. Maybe
I'm not the person to do this.

175
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:30,458
No, no. You wanted to be a filmmaker, right?
This is your shot.

176
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,592
I know. I'm sorry.

177
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:32,960
Maybe you need a professional,

178
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:34,394
someone who knows
how to open people up...

179
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,963
No, no. You're great.
You're the man, George.

180
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:38,064
I'm sure. Let me see the tape.

181
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,566
You got the tape.
Let me see it.

182
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:42,467
It's not very good.
I don't think...

183
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:44,402
Come on. Come on.
Let's go look at it.

184
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:45,603
Okay.

185
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:49,073
<i>Oh, hold on.</i>
<i>I left my lens cap on.</i>

186
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:52,209
<i>All right, I'm ready. Rolling.</i>

187
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:53,143
<i>What exactly does he want?</i>

188
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:55,979
<i>Just a few words. Things
you remember about him,</i>

189
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:58,147
<i>funny moments,</i>
<i>things like that.</i>

190
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:00,282
<i>What's he want this for?</i>
<i>I don't know exactly.</i>

191
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:05,487
<i>I think it's some kind of a surprise.
He doesn't want his wife to know.</i>

192
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,889
<i>Has anyone else done it?</i>
<i>Brenda.</i>

193
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:12,426
<i>Look, why don't you get somebody
else to do this first, okay?</i>

194
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:17,129
<i>Bob Jones is one of the great
men in public relations.</i>

195
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:21,533
LA Magazine <i> rated him one of the
top-10 most powerful men in the field.</i>

196
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:27,472
<i>He's charming, clever, funny,
a real wheeler-dealer.</i>

197
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:28,172
This is good.

198
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:30,107
<i>What about personal stuff?</i>

199
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:33,476
<i>Personal?</i>

200
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:37,580
<i>Yeah. Whatever you talk
about outside the office.</i>

201
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,150
<i>Sports, movies.</i>
<i>Come on. You know.</i>

202
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:43,285
<i>He loves the Raiders.</i>

203
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:45,787
There. I love the Raiders.
Okay. Good, good.

204
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:48,422
<i>I've known Mr. Jones</i>
<i>for five months now,</i>

205
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:52,259
<i>and he's the best boss</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

206
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:53,826
<i>Ever.</i>

207
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:56,328
<i>He never complains</i>
<i>when I disconnect him,</i>

208
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,433
<i>or lose a call or give him</i>
<i>the wrong phone message.</i>

209
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:05,270
<i>He's very compassionate, and...</i>

210
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,873
<i>I just think</i>
<i>he's a really great guy.</i>

211
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,810
<i>Can I do it one more time?</i>
<i>One more, I swear.</i>

212
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,212
<i>I'll get it right.</i> We
did it four times.

213
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,980
Four times? Yeah.

214
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,114
<i>You sure it's off?</i>

215
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,915
Oh, no. I didn't
know this recorded.

216
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,784
<i>Well, the truth is, I mean, um...
</i> I wanna see this.

217
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:27,522
<i>I don't really know him. I don't
know if anybody really knows him.</i>

218
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:28,923
<i>I mean, um, including himself.</i>

219
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:33,060
<i>He's not exactly what</i>
<i>you'd call an examined life.</i>

220
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,927
<i>Well, God, this is tricky.</i>
<i>I mean, uh...</i>

221
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:39,231
<i>I mean, the truth is he's
really a product of his own PR.</i>

222
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,031
<i>What do you mean?</i>

223
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:44,835
<i>Well, I mean, like, his MBA. He told everybody
he went to the University of Michigan.</i>

224
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:50,273
<i>In fact, he graduated from Wayne State.
Only spent one semester at Michigan.</i>

225
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,474
<i>Oh, he's brilliant</i>
<i>with resumes.</i>

226
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:57,178
<i>His name's not even Jones. It's,
uh, Ivanovich or something.</i>

227
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,512
<i>Why is that light blinking?</i>

228
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:00,847
<i>I think it means</i>
<i>the battery's charged.</i>

229
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:01,347
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

230
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:04,950
<i>This is terrible. Isn't there
anything nice you could say?</i>

231
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:08,053
<i>Go ahead. Start it. I'll
talk about his charity work.</i>

232
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:12,957
<i>He'll like that.</i>
<i>Okay. I'm ready. Rolling.</i>

233
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:16,626
I didn't know that recorded.

234
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:19,295
No, that's okay.
It's all right.

235
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:21,596
Good job, man.

236
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:22,964
I'm really sorry, Mr. Jones.

237
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,765
What? It's good.
It's very good.

238
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,433
It's terrific.
Don't worry about it.

239
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:28,301
That's the idea.

240
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:51,789
Thanks, Sandy.

241
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:56,727
Rosemary asked us to dinner, but
don't worry, I didn't commit.

242
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,462
And Dr. Califano's
office called.

243
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,697
They wanna see us on Friday.

244
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:02,665
Test results.

245
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,133
Are you listening?

246
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:06,801
I can't eat any of this.

247
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,636
Well, how about some plain chicken?
We can ask them to boil it.

248
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:14,174
Yeah, but I'm gonna throw up all over the table.
I can't eat this.

249
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:17,644
Okay. What about some plain rice?
That shouldn't upset your...

250
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:20,613
Gail, come on.
We didn't come here for me.

251
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:22,948
You been craving
Cuban food all week.

252
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,416
Just order.

253
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,357
I, um...

254
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,593
I wanted to tell you
something else.

255
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:37,760
I'm having another ultrasound.

256
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:41,630
Not right away, down the road.
I'd like you to be there.

257
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,298
Wait. Before you reject
this, just listen.

258
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,801
I think it would be good for you. It
will give us a picture of the baby.

259
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:53,507
You'll be able to see it. We might
even find out if it's a boy or a girl.

260
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,443
We could choose a name,

261
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:59,278
buy clothes.

262
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,949
I need to share this
with you, Bob.

263
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:09,752
Don't make me go through it alone, please.
It's our baby.

264
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:14,022
Don't pretend it away.
I'm not pretending it away.

265
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:17,992
I'm setting up trust funds.
I'm preparing for its future.

266
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:19,960
What kind of pretending
is that?

267
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:21,494
Damn it.

268
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:25,363
Bob, please.

269
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,665
Love us.

270
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:42,878
Doris. Wow! Look at this.

271
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,613
Green sludge
and my mother-in-law,

272
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:45,513
together in the same room.

273
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:48,115
Boy, it doesn't get much
better than this, does it?

274
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:48,682
Hiya, Bobbie.

275
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,417
What'd you do,
wake up at the crack of dawn?

276
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,952
Oh, beautiful morning.
Just felt like a drive.

277
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:53,953
I wanted to visit my daughter.

278
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:57,022
Really? She didn't call you to tempt
you with leftover Cuban food?

279
00:18:57,024 --> 00:19:00,158
I'm too old for temptations,
Bob, especially leftovers.

280
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,395
Well, here's to many such fine mornings.
Down the hatch.

281
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:05,863
God, how can you drink that?

282
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:10,567
Not too bad really when you
get to that chewy center.

283
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:14,036
Mmm. It's really good.
That's disgusting.

284
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:14,770
Really? Yeah.

285
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,571
Sorry. Sure you
don't want some?

286
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,573
Thanks. Maybe next time.

287
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,407
Might not be a next time, Do.

288
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,511
Mmm. You know,
you married a saint.

289
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,748
I know. It's the
balance of nature.

290
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,816
Together, we almost
make a normal person.

291
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:34,253
I called your parents this morning.
You're kidding.

292
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:37,289
What'd you do that for?
Somebody had to.

293
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,790
I told them you were
having tests.

294
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,258
They were grateful to know.
You should call 'em

295
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,761
I talk to them all the time. I
just called them, when was it?

296
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:48,599
Four months ago, when we found out I was pregnant.
You didn't say two words.

297
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,700
Your mom sounded concerned.

298
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:51,733
Concerned?
If she loves me so much,

299
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:55,670
why doesn't she get on an airplane
and come on out here and see me?

300
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,405
Fly? She doesn't
love God that much.

301
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:58,773
You should call her.

302
00:19:58,775 --> 00:19:59,874
Why? We have one conversation.

303
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:02,376
I don't need to keep having
it over and over again.

304
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:03,477
Be grateful they're there.

305
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:07,948
Look. I spent 20 years
trying to get out of Detroit.

306
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:09,949
I don't need to go back.

307
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:12,818
Paul's getting married.

308
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:15,153
You're kidding.

309
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:16,286
To whom?

310
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:21,591
I don't know. Anya something.
Your mom said she was lovely.

311
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:22,391
Anya. Yeah, that's perfect.

312
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:26,395
Probably in food services or
sanitation, somethin' like that.

313
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:29,898
It's April 21st. I thought
it might be nice if we went.

314
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,299
You mean we're invited?

315
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:37,102
Look. Forget it. I'll probably
be dead by that time anyway.

316
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:41,505
Great. Then we'll have the perfect
excuse of not showing up.

317
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,509
Come on. We haven't
been there in four years.

318
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Will you at least
think about it?

319
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:50,680
I'll see.

320
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,981
We need family, Bob.

321
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:55,351
It's true. If it wasn't for
my mom, who would I have?

322
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:57,019
Hmm?

323
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,488
You'd have me.

324
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:05,258
We got the lab
reports back this morning.

325
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,994
I'm sorry, Bob.
They don't look very good.

326
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:11,697
There's been no reduction
in tumor size or density.

327
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:14,966
And based on your response
to the Interleukin therapy,

328
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:17,902
I can't recommend
further treatment.

329
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:20,003
We're losing ground, Bob.

330
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:25,074
The tumor's growing, and I think you
have to face things as they are.

331
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,943
Of course, we'll continue
to monitor everything.

332
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:29,978
You could still have
three or four months.

333
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,714
I think you should
aim for that.

334
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,683
Four months.

335
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,685
You have a spring
to look forward to.

336
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:44,656
The symptoms won't be too bad. We
have drugs to manage the pain.

337
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:56,200
What if I wanna do
the treatment again?

338
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:58,035
What if I elect to do it?
Are you gonna stop me?

339
00:21:58,037 --> 00:21:59,803
Are you gonna get
a court order to stop me?

340
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:01,471
I can't believe
you're asking this.

341
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:02,872
The Interleukin
nearly killed you.

342
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:07,877
It was touch and go for six hours.
And it didn't work.

343
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,985
Come on.

344
00:22:18,854 --> 00:22:22,322
I'm still in the game
here, man, you know?

345
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:24,456
Come on. One more.

346
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,125
I mean, there are
a lot of other therapies.

347
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:32,296
Lot of other, uh,
treatments... Right?

348
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:35,365
Bob, don't make this any more
painful than it has to be.

349
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:40,703
You don't have a lot of time left.
Don't waste it in futile searches.

350
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:44,606
Medicine has got
some terrible limitations.

351
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:48,776
And I wish there were
something more I could say.

352
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:52,512
There just aren't any words.

353
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,177
...Thursday at 2:00 PM.

354
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,811
Mr. Jones...

355
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,685
Who the hell do
you think you are?

356
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:39,255
You think you can take away
my hope like that?

357
00:23:39,323 --> 00:23:41,022
Let me tell you something.

358
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:44,692
That's all I have. Got it?

359
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:48,061
That's all I have.

360
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,563
I'm gonna beat
this thing, Gail.

361
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:29,334
I'll beat it.

362
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:31,369
I know.

363
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,878
Look at this. This is crazy.

364
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,814
We're gonna be lucky if we get
out of here without getting hit

365
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:44,881
by a wrecking ball.

366
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,883
Just close your eyes.

367
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,317
Let's go home.

368
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,652
No, we're not going anywhere. Robin's
father had pancreatic cancer.

369
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:54,455
Now he doesn't. That's all
I need to know. Come on.

370
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,559
Look at this. How can they fix bodies?
They can't even fix their own hallways.

371
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:03,062
That's what we're gonna find out.
Okay.

372
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:05,898
Here. 202.

373
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:31,656
Which of these things doesn't
belong here? Pick two.

374
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:34,958
Here. Read something.

375
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,632
Oh. Thanks.

376
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:47,168
Oh, good. Sports. Great.

377
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,110
I feel better already.
Let's go.

378
00:25:57,745 --> 00:25:59,878
Mr. Jones?

379
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,968
Take off your shoes
and lie down.

380
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:53,931
How you doin'?

381
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:57,901
Look. Just so you know. I'm
looking for a miracle here, so...

382
00:26:57,969 --> 00:26:59,835
Do you believe in miracles?

383
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,903
I will if this works.

384
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,306
Uh-huh. Very bad stomach, huh?

385
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,574
You take too much Rolaids.

386
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:11,843
Yeah, I do.
How'd you know that?

387
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:15,879
It fell out of
your pocket. Half empty.

388
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,415
Pretty good.

389
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:26,955
Mmm-hmm.

390
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:31,826
You had your appendix
out a long time ago.

391
00:27:39,969 --> 00:27:41,902
You were a child.

392
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:44,704
Yes?

393
00:27:44,772 --> 00:27:46,571
Four or five?

394
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,905
Five.

395
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:51,041
Five. That's what I thought.

396
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:07,156
Aha. The tumors are here.

397
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:09,791
In the lungs. Two of them.

398
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:11,626
Very big.

399
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,701
Mmm-hmm. The disease
comes from the kidneys.

400
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,136
Very sick.

401
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,706
You just get comfortable.

402
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:29,608
I work.

403
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,441
You must relax. Relax.

404
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:43,644
I am relaxed.

405
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:45,412
Where's Gail?

406
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:47,647
What is that? That hurt.

407
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:48,280
You fight me.

408
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:51,116
You make it hard for me to do.

409
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:55,653
You hold too much anger inside.
It poisons you.

410
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:58,422
I'm not holdin' on to anything.

411
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:04,961
Do you want to carry so much
pain into your next life?

412
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:09,098
My next life?

413
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,333
The last second of your life

414
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:14,903
is the most important
moment of all.

415
00:30:14,905 --> 00:30:17,605
It's everything you are,

416
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,238
ever said,

417
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,108
ever thought,
all rolled into one.

418
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,277
That is the seed
of your next life.

419
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:36,720
Until that last moment,
you still have time.

420
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:39,088
You can change everything.

421
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,991
You can let go of your fear.
You can let go of your anger.

422
00:30:44,994 --> 00:30:47,995
I'm not angry, okay?

423
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:53,633
He's a quack.
A total charlatan quack.

424
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,034
You didn't feel anything?

425
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:56,702
Yeah, I felt
the urge to get out.

426
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:58,837
Guy actually smelled my wrist.

427
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,671
How about that?

428
00:30:59,673 --> 00:31:03,508
Kept telling me how angry I
was, stupid son of a bitch.

429
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,276
What else did he say?

430
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:05,943
Eh, I had no faith.

431
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:08,578
A bunch of bullshit. Life is
always trying to talk to me.

432
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,947
Life is always sending
me invitations.

433
00:31:10,949 --> 00:31:13,883
Yeah, I'd like to know what
invitation life sent me.

434
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:16,952
You got one to your
brother's wedding.

435
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:19,587
I don't think
that's what he meant.

436
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:28,061
Man, come on.

437
00:31:35,336 --> 00:31:37,736
What the hell has
gotten into you?

438
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:41,906
Reincarnation?

439
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:44,275
I just wanna know
if you believe in it.

440
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:45,375
I don't know.

441
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:47,276
Put it on the ballot,
I'll vote for it, okay?

442
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,279
Why? I don't know. I just been
thinking about it lately.

443
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:52,981
Thinking about it?
What's to think about?

444
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:54,716
Come on, Bob.

445
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:55,983
You make, uh, what, 250 a year?

446
00:31:55,985 --> 00:31:58,952
You're in the top one
percentile in the country.

447
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:02,088
Stop contemplating the
afterlife and enjoy this one.

448
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,056
I mean, don't you ever think,

449
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:06,792
you know, what this all is?

450
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,560
Why you're here,
who you really are?

451
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:10,328
You never think about that? No.

452
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:10,961
Never? No!

453
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:13,663
What is with you all of a sudden?
You're a philosopher?

454
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,533
I took philosophy in college.
It got me nowhere.

455
00:32:21,138 --> 00:32:23,038
Are you happy? Come on, Bob.

456
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,906
No, wait a minute.
Listen to me.

457
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:26,741
When is the last time you said,

458
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:30,010
"You know, I'm really happy"?

459
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:33,980
Okay. I was really happy when I
was beating you at racquetball.

460
00:32:33,982 --> 00:32:36,449
I am really happy right
now taking this sauna.

461
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:41,854
I have been happy all day up until
this ridiculous conversation.

462
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:43,989
You okay? Yeah.

463
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:45,823
Why? I mean,
why did you ask me that?

464
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:48,358
Because you're acting a
little weird in your old age.

465
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,327
You gotta learn to stop
tormenting yourself so much.

466
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:52,928
Turn it off.

467
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,248
Hello.

468
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,083
Hi. Carol Sandman?

469
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:19,186
Sandman? Boy, that
was a long time ago.

470
00:33:19,188 --> 00:33:21,421
Who are you? What's
with this camera?

471
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:22,622
Uh, I'm Bob.

472
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:25,658
I'm, uh, Bob Ivanovich?

473
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:29,160
Bobbie? Hi. Do you remember me?

474
00:33:29,162 --> 00:33:31,829
Oh, my God. Bobbie?

475
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:33,496
I don't believe this.

476
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:36,999
What are you doing here?
How did you find me?

477
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:38,900
Uh, do you remember
Tony Farantino?

478
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:39,467
Tony.

479
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:41,168
I ran into him, and he told
me you lived out here.

480
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:45,038
Oh, my God. This is so amazing.
I mean...

481
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,206
It's got to be, what,
25, 30 years?

482
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,974
Look at you.
You're all grown up.

483
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:50,375
Body hair and everything.

484
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:53,311
I just can't believe this.

485
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:55,313
It's so amazing.

486
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:57,481
I mean, how can you
not remember anything?

487
00:33:57,483 --> 00:33:59,883
You lived right next door
to me, for crying out loud.

488
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:02,151
I know. I must have
repressed everything.

489
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:04,820
I mean, I remember
your parents vaguely.

490
00:34:04,822 --> 00:34:05,754
And I remember your brother.

491
00:34:05,756 --> 00:34:07,689
Oh, he's married now.
He has three kids

492
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:09,791
and he owns a gun shop
in San Antonio.

493
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,160
Really? It's so good to see you.

494
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:13,761
Thanks. I've got
two kids myself.

495
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:15,662
I know it looks
like a lot more.

496
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:16,929
My oldest, Mara,
is in preschool,

497
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:19,464
and Sophia is probably gonna
wake up any minute now

498
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:21,299
so you'll meet her. Thanks.

499
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:23,567
Well, Gail and I
are having our first one.

500
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:26,536
Oh, Bobbie, that's so exciting.
A little Bobbie.

501
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:29,238
It is very exciting. In fact,
that's what the tape is for.

502
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,710
I wanted to make something to show him
or her, whomever it's going to be,

503
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:35,911
you know, who I was.

504
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:37,479
That's a great idea.
That really is.

505
00:34:37,481 --> 00:34:40,782
Yeah. There's only one problem.
I can't remember anything.

506
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:42,917
Oh, come on. Sure you can.
Uh-uh.

507
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:47,688
You don't remember how you and me
used to laugh together for hours?

508
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,288
No.

509
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,989
Oh, and we used to sit in my
bedroom and listen to Petula Clark

510
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:53,859
sing <i> Downtown</i> over and over
again, and you would dance.

511
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:56,895
I danced? I was a dancer.
You danced.

512
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,097
Oh, and you were so funny. You
were always making up stories.

513
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:04,201
Like once you tried to convince us
that your dad was a secret FBI agent.

514
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:07,337
You remember that? Oh, well, my
dad was an secret FBI agent.

515
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,338
That part was true.

516
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,808
And how when you grew up,
you were going to famous?

517
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,508
No, I don't remember.

518
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,042
And you always
had these dreams.

519
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,610
And I mean, look at you.

520
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:17,678
You made it happen.
It's really amazing.

521
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,779
Well, I mean, I don't know...

522
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:21,681
You did. Kind of, yeah.

523
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:25,885
Oop, here we go. Baby time.

524
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:29,554
That's good.
That looks natural.

525
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:31,489
Yeah? Doesn't feel natural.

526
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:32,556
Oh, it just takes
a little practice.

527
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:36,059
You're gonna be a really great father.
I can tell. Really.

528
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:38,261
Yeah, what do you know
that I don't know?

529
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,296
Here. Let's trade.

530
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:43,532
Here you go. Yeah. Got it?

531
00:35:43,534 --> 00:35:46,001
Yeah. There we are.

532
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,567
There we are.

533
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:49,269
You know what my Uncle
Rudy always used to say?

534
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:52,272
He said the best thing parents
can do for their kids

535
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:53,373
is just love each other.

536
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,308
"Kids need to marinate
in love," he said,

537
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:00,179
"And after about 16 years,
they're really juicy."

538
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,046
That's great.

539
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:03,848
See, I knew I needed
to see you for something.

540
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,984
Well, seek and ye shall find.
Yeah.

541
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:09,453
I never been much of a seeker.

542
00:36:09,455 --> 00:36:10,320
Hey, what are you
talking about?

543
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:12,822
You're here, you found
me, didn't you?

544
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:15,191
It's really great
to be here, Carol.

545
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:47,321
Okay. Uh, music.

546
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:49,856
This is actually a pretty
important subject.

547
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:51,791
Uh, try to stay with the classics.
I would say, uh,

548
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:57,429
Stones, Elvis, Stevie Wonder, James
Brown always. Anything Motown.

549
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:59,164
Uh, don't get into any
trendy music, you know?

550
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:04,936
Anything where a guy would set
himself on fire, I would avoid.

551
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:07,571
Your mother is going to be
of no help in this area.

552
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:10,040
She will try to fill your
head with show tunes.

553
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:10,840
If she starts singing...

554
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:14,243
<i>¶ Some enchanted evening</i>
<i>you will meet... ¶</i>

555
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:15,911
Turn and run
the opposite direction.

556
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:20,548
Otherwise, you're gonna have <i> South
Pacific</i> coming out your nostrils.

557
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,050
Uh, Temps. Temptations.

558
00:37:23,052 --> 00:37:23,717
Can't lose.

559
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,152
You can't lose with the Temps.
Uh, Smokey...

560
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:31,323
What next?

561
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:36,127
<i>All right, now, this is a little
bit of a delicate subject.</i>

562
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:41,065
<i>Someday your mom may want
to get married again.</i>

563
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:43,400
<i>And this might make you
feel a little strange</i>

564
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:44,467
<i>or even a little angry,</i>

565
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:48,637
<i>like maybe she's</i>
<i>being disloyal to me.</i>

566
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:52,807
<i>Well, let's think this over.</i>

567
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:57,911
<i>Your mom is a pretty</i>
<i>wonderful person.</i>

568
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:03,315
<i>She's funny and nice</i>
<i>and pretty and smart.</i>

569
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:04,949
<i>She married me, didn't she?</i>

570
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:08,652
<i>And she might also get lonely,
and maybe she'll meet some guy</i>

571
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:11,621
<i>who's a really nice guy</i>
<i>and you really like him,</i>

572
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,389
<i>and he plays baseball with you,</i>

573
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,958
<i>and takes you to Lakers games.</i>

574
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,728
<i>And don't worry about me</i>
<i>being jealous 'cause...</i>

575
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,063
<i>Well, I might be</i>
<i>a little jealous,</i>

576
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:26,300
<i>'cause he'll be doing all the
things that I wanna do with you.</i>

577
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:30,203
<i>But if he's smart,</i>

578
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:32,605
<i>he won't ever try</i>
<i>to take my place.</i>

579
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:35,407
<i>'Cause you know and I know</i>

580
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:41,112
<i>that I'm your dad, and that's
never gonna change, ever.</i>

581
00:38:41,114 --> 00:38:44,348
<i>I'm not saying this is
going to happen for sure.</i>

582
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,150
<i>I'm just saying if it happens,</i>

583
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:49,385
<i>I wanted you</i>
<i>to know how I feel.</i>

584
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:53,956
<i>I mean, we both want
your mom to be happy.</i>

585
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,691
<i>Don't we?</i>

586
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:02,597
Why didn't you tell me?

587
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,268
I couldn't.

588
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:13,738
Well, I wish I could
tell you that I love it,

589
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:17,808
that I admire what you've done.

590
00:39:20,846 --> 00:39:22,545
But mostly I...

591
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:25,814
It just really hurts me, Bob.

592
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,085
I know maybe it
shouldn't, but it does.

593
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,821
Why can't you tell me
these things?

594
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:37,023
Why is it you can tell
all this to a camera,

595
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:40,626
you can open your heart
to a machine?

596
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,928
I'm flesh and blood.

597
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,764
I'm here for you anytime.

598
00:39:47,533 --> 00:39:50,967
Your silence isn't
protecting me, Bob.

599
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:54,502
I feel like
I've already lost you.

600
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:58,772
Like we've lost each other.

601
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:01,240
What do you want me to say?

602
00:40:01,242 --> 00:40:04,543
Don't say anything.
Just hear me.

603
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:08,847
Bob, I need you. I need you too.
I can't do this alone.

604
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:10,882
I need you to be there.

605
00:40:16,187 --> 00:40:17,986
How can I be there?

606
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:19,988
Let me inside.

607
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:23,924
Share what you're feeling.

608
00:40:27,796 --> 00:40:29,962
That's all I need.

609
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,084
Bob! Bob, it's all right.

610
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:58,287
It's all right.
It's okay. I'm here.

611
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,355
Hey, it's all right.

612
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,825
I don't wanna die.

613
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,726
Don't let me die, Gail.

614
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,494
No, it's okay.

615
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,896
It's okay.

616
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:28,281
I wanna live.

617
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:32,451
I know.

618
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,460
I wanna live.

619
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:46,196
If you want to know the truth,

620
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:48,598
I'm surprised you came back.

621
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,367
If you wanna know
the truth, so am I.

622
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:53,035
Most people like you come once.

623
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:55,237
Then never see them again.

624
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:57,138
My wife talked me into it.

625
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,039
Oh, she's very good woman.

626
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,507
Yeah, she is, very good.

627
00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:03,343
That's why I married her
as a matter of fact.

628
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:05,178
It's not enough
to marry goodness.

629
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,447
You have to find it
in yourself.

630
00:42:08,982 --> 00:42:10,982
Try and relax.

631
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:14,051
I am relaxed.

632
00:42:14,253 --> 00:42:16,219
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

633
00:42:29,534 --> 00:42:31,667
What the hell are
you doing to me?

634
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:34,970
That was good.
I got some poison out.

635
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:37,292
Now I can see more clearly.

636
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:42,543
Your anger is very
deep and very old.

637
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:45,378
Who you been talking
to, my wife?

638
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,812
I talk to nobody.

639
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,680
I just listen to your heart.

640
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:53,751
But if you listen to it,
you will not need me.

641
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:57,621
Your heart is crying out.

642
00:42:58,056 --> 00:42:59,422
Forgive.

643
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,493
Forgive who?

644
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:08,496
I don't have anybody
to forgive.

645
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:13,234
Here we are, winging our way
across the breadbasket of America,

646
00:43:13,236 --> 00:43:15,703
on our way to
picturesque Detroit.

647
00:43:15,705 --> 00:43:20,507
Now, do you wanna know why we're
making this epic 2,000 mile journey?

648
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:25,712
Let me put on your mom, who
will explain to you why. Mom?

649
00:43:25,714 --> 00:43:29,716
Tell your child why it is we're
going back to the one place

650
00:43:29,718 --> 00:43:31,350
I tried hardest
to get away from.

651
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:37,723
Because your Uncle Paul is getting
married, and they invited us to come.

652
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,158
Oh, because this video
wouldn't be complete

653
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,827
without showing where
your father used to live.

654
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:47,932
Right. Because your father
needs to see his family.

655
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:52,169
You want more? No. See?

656
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,371
Here we are with the
Detroit Police Department

657
00:43:54,373 --> 00:43:59,342
on a secret raid in a hotel room
in suburban drug-infested Detroit.

658
00:44:01,746 --> 00:44:03,078
Here's the suspect over here,

659
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,746
lying flat,
passed out on the bed.

660
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:08,750
Begin undercover operation. Let's
go right under the covers.

661
00:44:08,752 --> 00:44:11,786
Ooh. Suspect has good legs.

662
00:44:12,722 --> 00:44:14,621
And a really big tummy.

663
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:17,657
Bob, what are you doing, hmm?

664
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:18,257
Open your eyes.

665
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:20,292
I want to see if your
pupils are dilated.

666
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:23,228
Oh, come on.
Go shoot something useful.

667
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,997
You don't mind, do you, honey?

668
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,497
You take your pills?

669
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:30,066
Fully medicated, babe.

670
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,435
Just drive carefully.

671
00:44:35,604 --> 00:44:38,104
Joking. See you. Oh!

672
00:44:39,173 --> 00:44:41,640
Oh. Am I bleeding?

673
00:44:52,486 --> 00:44:53,885
Hmm.

674
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,559
It's so small.

675
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:25,839
Mommy! Mommy! Oh, it's okay.

676
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:27,907
It's okay. I'm Bob Jones.

677
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:29,341
Er, Ivanovich. I lived here.

678
00:46:29,343 --> 00:46:31,376
This used to be my house.

679
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:35,112
Years ago. It's okay, really.

680
00:46:48,894 --> 00:46:52,028
Do you mind... Sure. Go ahead.

681
00:47:35,106 --> 00:47:35,571
Hi.

682
00:47:35,573 --> 00:47:38,507
Did you used to sleep
up here, too?

683
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:40,708
Yeah. When I was little,

684
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:42,009
about your age.

685
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:43,443
In my bed?

686
00:47:43,812 --> 00:47:45,444
No. No, I had my own bed,

687
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:48,680
right here against the wall,
right by the window,

688
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:52,350
and the people who lived
over here were called Sandman.

689
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:55,586
That's the Robinsons,
they live there, now.

690
00:47:55,588 --> 00:47:57,020
Oh, yeah?

691
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:59,755
My brother's bed used
to be right over there.

692
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:02,724
We used to talk all night long.

693
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:04,392
You want to see where I hide?

694
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:05,693
Sure.

695
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:15,234
Ah.

696
00:48:15,569 --> 00:48:17,435
I used to hide in here.

697
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:19,804
It's a good hiding
spot, isn't it?

698
00:48:19,806 --> 00:48:21,205
Yeah.

699
00:48:27,978 --> 00:48:28,509
Bobbie?

700
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:30,611
What are you doing in there?

701
00:48:30,613 --> 00:48:32,846
What is all this
about a circus?

702
00:48:32,848 --> 00:48:35,081
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

703
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,248
Are you lying to me?

704
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:36,915
You're the liar.

705
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:40,518
You said you were gonna
take us to the circus.

706
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,118
You promised.

707
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,087
No, Bobbie. I did not promise.

708
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:45,254
I said I would try.

709
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,123
You promise things,
but you never do them.

710
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,058
What is it you want, Bobbie?

711
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,260
You want food on the table?

712
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:52,860
People have to work.

713
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:54,595
That's all you ever do.
You always work.

714
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:58,565
You're never, ever home. You
never do anything with us.

715
00:48:58,567 --> 00:49:00,967
I hate you. I hate you.

716
00:49:02,503 --> 00:49:05,570
I never heard that story before.
How come you never told me?

717
00:49:05,572 --> 00:49:07,271
I totally forgot about it.

718
00:49:07,273 --> 00:49:10,674
I must have blanked it out
or something. How's this?

719
00:49:10,842 --> 00:49:12,508
Can you imagine?

720
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,243
I invited my entire class

721
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:17,311
to a circus in my back yard.

722
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:20,314
Why would I do
something like that?

723
00:49:20,316 --> 00:49:22,149
Maybe for attention.

724
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,016
Yeah, maybe.

725
00:49:24,518 --> 00:49:25,517
I mean,

726
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:26,818
I really thought
it would be there.

727
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,922
I thought I'd go home and there'd be a circus there.
I really believed it.

728
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:33,424
<i>¶ Someday I'll wish upon a star</i>

729
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:37,194
<i>¶ And wake up where</i>
<i>the clouds are far behind me.</i>

730
00:49:37,196 --> 00:49:38,061
Why are you doing that?

731
00:49:38,063 --> 00:49:39,662
<i>¶ Where troubles</i>
<i>melt like lemon drops</i>

732
00:49:39,664 --> 00:49:42,064
<i>¶ Away upon the chimney tops.</i>

733
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:42,764
Okay. All right.

734
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:43,664
<i>¶ That's where you'll find me</i>

735
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:48,168
<i>¶ Somewhere over the rainbow</i>
<i>bluebirds... ¶</i>

736
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:50,670
The people are
gonna be, like...

737
00:49:50,672 --> 00:49:51,570
...next door.

738
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:54,405
You're a believer.

739
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,642
It's so weird.

740
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:03,412
I don't even know
who that person was.

741
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:06,748
Oh, come on.
Sounds just like you.

742
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,782
What do you mean?

743
00:50:07,784 --> 00:50:09,917
You're still a ringmaster.

744
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:11,551
Bob Jones, public relations,

745
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:14,887
except instead of wishing for
circuses, you're creating them.

746
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:18,156
You got 20 rings all going
at the same time.

747
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,158
It's really sweet.

748
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:22,525
Hmm.

749
00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:25,561
In some ways you're
still just that little boy.

750
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:52,886
"Star light, star bright.

751
00:50:54,122 --> 00:50:56,455
"First star I see tonight.

752
00:50:58,025 --> 00:51:00,625
"I wish I may, I wish I might.

753
00:51:00,893 --> 00:51:03,460
"Have the wish I wish tonight."

754
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:07,864
Please, God,

755
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:12,701
just let me live long
enough to see my child.

756
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:18,206
That's all I'm asking.

757
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,017
How do I look?

758
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:31,519
I feel fat.

759
00:51:31,754 --> 00:51:33,320
Don't worry about it.

760
00:51:34,022 --> 00:51:35,755
They'd love you.

761
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,322
Come on.

762
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:45,529
Bobbie! Oh, my God!
Gail and Bobbie! Oh!

763
00:51:45,531 --> 00:51:48,064
Rose, come here! Mr. Hollywood.

764
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:50,099
How are things in movie land?

765
00:51:50,101 --> 00:51:51,200
Bobbie! Bobbie!

766
00:51:51,202 --> 00:51:53,702
Come here. Give me a kiss!

767
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:56,604
Gail, look at that tummy.

768
00:51:56,606 --> 00:51:58,138
I know.

769
00:51:59,674 --> 00:52:00,739
Bobbie, how are you?

770
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:03,241
You're gonna be
a grandfather, huh?

771
00:52:06,913 --> 00:52:08,946
I'm glad to look at you.

772
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:10,713
Gail!

773
00:52:25,428 --> 00:52:27,928
Two words. Weight Watchers.

774
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,431
I thought instead of having a wedding
I'd be having a nervous breakdown,

775
00:52:31,433 --> 00:52:34,033
because my husband
wasn't at the church.

776
00:52:34,035 --> 00:52:36,301
He and the best man got lost.

777
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:37,335
He always got lost.

778
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:38,803
You remember.

779
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:40,504
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you

780
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:42,806
but I have a wedding
to attend to tomorrow.

781
00:52:42,808 --> 00:52:44,140
Let's go, honey.
It's getting late.

782
00:52:44,142 --> 00:52:46,942
Ooh, it is getting late.
Goodbye, everybody.

783
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:48,109
Bye-bye. Bye.

784
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:48,676
Hey, Bob,

785
00:52:48,678 --> 00:52:51,512
don't you ever come out from
behind that thing, huh?

786
00:52:51,514 --> 00:52:52,779
Nah.

787
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:53,779
Just kidding.

788
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:58,150
Okay, hi. My name is Paul.
I'm your uncle,

789
00:52:58,152 --> 00:52:59,518
your father's baby brother,

790
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,888
the one he hasn't talked to
in nearly two years.

791
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,689
Got that in there.

792
00:53:04,691 --> 00:53:09,026
And this is my fiancee,
Annie. Annie Stasiuk.

793
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:09,726
Not for long.

794
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,062
And over there is her
parents, Lida and Nestor.

795
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,797
I'm Lida. I'm Nestor.

796
00:53:18,736 --> 00:53:21,303
This is my dad,
your grandfather,

797
00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:23,638
Bill Ivanovich. Dad, wake up.

798
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,041
Wave away that smoke
and say hello.

799
00:53:27,643 --> 00:53:28,808
Hello?

800
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:31,443
Okay.

801
00:53:31,445 --> 00:53:32,977
This is Rose.

802
00:53:32,979 --> 00:53:34,278
This is your grandmother.

803
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,647
It's my mom. Come on, Rose,

804
00:53:36,649 --> 00:53:38,382
say something to the camera.

805
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:40,384
I've got nothing to say.

806
00:53:40,386 --> 00:53:42,953
Stop hiding behind that thing.

807
00:53:42,955 --> 00:53:44,354
Let us see you.

808
00:53:44,356 --> 00:53:46,489
Turn it off, already. Ma, Ma.

809
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:47,523
It's not a lineup.

810
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:49,324
You're not in the mafia,
are you?

811
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,926
Turn it off.

812
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,161
God, my back is killing me.

813
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:56,429
I gotta get out of this stuff.

814
00:53:57,064 --> 00:53:57,962
So scary.

815
00:53:57,964 --> 00:54:01,832
Smartest thing I ever did
was get away from here.

816
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:03,400
They really love you, though.

817
00:54:03,402 --> 00:54:05,769
Underneath it all,
you can feel it,

818
00:54:05,771 --> 00:54:07,137
you really can.

819
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:10,039
What are you feeling with,
your feet?

820
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:12,040
Poor Paul.

821
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:14,776
He had his chance
to escape. He blew it.

822
00:54:14,778 --> 00:54:15,777
It was his choice.

823
00:54:15,779 --> 00:54:17,111
If he would have
only listened to me.

824
00:54:17,113 --> 00:54:20,814
You know, there are thousands of
great jobs in LA, great women...

825
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:24,284
Now he's stuck in the junk business
with my father. What a waste.

826
00:54:24,286 --> 00:54:24,884
Oh, come on.

827
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:29,288
You're here to make peace. Enjoy
them for what they are. Accept them.

828
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,989
They're yours.

829
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:52,210
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

830
00:54:52,212 --> 00:54:57,448
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

831
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:02,820
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

832
00:55:03,222 --> 00:55:07,891
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

833
00:55:07,893 --> 00:55:13,296
<i>¶ Hallelujah</i>

834
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:21,237
<i>¶ Hallelujah ¶</i>

835
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:26,809
Lord, our God, crown them
with glory and honor.

836
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:11,943
Wow! Come on!

837
00:57:46,277 --> 00:57:49,411
Hey, Bobbie. Bobbie, come on!

838
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:51,679
No, no.

839
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:53,613
Aw, go on!

840
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:56,882
I'm doing this. Dance with me, Bobbie.
Come on.

841
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:27,145
I can't breathe.

842
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:28,779
It's okay.

843
00:58:46,264 --> 00:58:48,631
Four tornadoes, I said, not 12.

844
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:52,001
The day you were born,
there were four tornadoes.

845
00:58:52,003 --> 00:58:55,471
One in Hamtramck
and three in Detroit,

846
00:58:55,473 --> 00:58:57,439
and nobody was killed.

847
00:58:57,441 --> 00:58:59,941
You exaggerate things.

848
00:59:00,076 --> 00:59:00,774
Yeah, but you said...

849
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:04,444
All right, you said I was a born disaster, right?
I mean, that's a quote.

850
00:59:04,446 --> 00:59:08,047
Oh, when you were four, yes.
A holy terror.

851
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:09,681
How about when I was 10?

852
00:59:09,683 --> 00:59:11,516
You were different at 10.

853
00:59:11,518 --> 00:59:13,751
You used to disappear for
hours into the basement.

854
00:59:13,753 --> 00:59:17,888
You would play with your trains.
You had an erector set...

855
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,189
We never saw you.

856
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:23,459
Why? What happened?
Why did I disappear?

857
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:25,460
You, uh...

858
00:59:25,462 --> 00:59:28,396
You were ashamed of us by then.

859
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,898
You hid everything from us.

860
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:32,865
You didn't bring
your friends home.

861
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:38,637
One time, your mother came to the
school to talk to the teacher,

862
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:41,339
and you pretended
not to know her.

863
00:59:41,341 --> 00:59:43,441
Not to know your own mother.

864
00:59:43,443 --> 00:59:44,942
She cried for two days.

865
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:46,910
Dad, come on.
It's my wedding day.

866
00:59:46,912 --> 00:59:50,747
What'd I tell you? Every time we
get together this shit happens.

867
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:52,982
Well, what do you think...

868
00:59:52,984 --> 00:59:55,417
I mean, why do you
think I did that?

869
00:59:55,419 --> 00:59:57,719
It was a long time ago.

870
00:59:57,721 --> 01:00:00,254
You always thought
you were too good for us.

871
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:02,055
That was your problem.

872
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,525
I think that...

873
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,759
I...

874
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:10,928
I think your kid should know

875
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:13,931
that his father was too
good for his own family,

876
01:00:13,933 --> 01:00:17,200
that the first chance
he gets, he runs away.

877
01:00:17,202 --> 01:00:21,771
He changes his name,
and he doesn't ever come back.

878
01:00:22,774 --> 01:00:25,508
You know, you're
changing the subject.

879
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:26,742
I'm sorry I brought it up.

880
01:00:26,744 --> 01:00:31,446
I'm not changing anything. You're the
one who changes things, "Jones".

881
01:00:31,448 --> 01:00:33,581
What's the matter?
You don't like my name?

882
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:36,483
Your father's name?
Your grandfather's name?

883
01:00:36,485 --> 01:00:39,919
I'm sorry. Please, Dad.
Just forget it, you know...

884
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:42,955
Change everything.
You run from everything.

885
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:44,856
You know what?

886
01:00:45,158 --> 01:00:46,891
I never ran.

887
01:00:47,026 --> 01:00:49,559
I never ran. I left!

888
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:51,160
You know why? I wanted a life.

889
01:00:51,162 --> 01:00:53,529
You can't have
a life with your family?

890
01:00:53,531 --> 01:00:58,867
If it wasn't for your wife, for her
phone calls, you'd be a dead man to us.

891
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:00,201
That's the truth!
What do you want me to do?

892
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:04,238
You want me to call and listen to
this same stuff over and over again?

893
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,841
Why would I do... Why would
any rational person do that?

894
01:01:07,843 --> 01:01:10,176
A man who loves
his family calls them.

895
01:01:10,178 --> 01:01:13,379
Oh. Dad, he really
does love you.

896
01:01:13,681 --> 01:01:15,080
Not in my book.

897
01:01:15,082 --> 01:01:16,081
Don't tell me...

898
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,515
Don't tell me about love, okay?

899
01:01:17,517 --> 01:01:21,652
You know why? Now
shut up for a minute.

900
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:25,288
I've lived in Los Angeles
10 years.

901
01:01:27,592 --> 01:01:30,059
You never came to see me once.

902
01:01:32,963 --> 01:01:36,264
You never saw what kind
of business I made,

903
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:37,998
what kind of life I live,

904
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,467
so don't tell me about love.

905
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:43,937
Come on, Bobbie.
You know Mom doesn't fly.

906
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:44,837
What about trains?

907
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:47,406
It's too far.
I can't go that far.

908
01:01:47,408 --> 01:01:48,974
See? Exactly.

909
01:01:49,676 --> 01:01:51,075
See?

910
01:01:51,077 --> 01:01:53,177
Now, maybe when
the baby is born.

911
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:55,512
Yeah. Right. Right.
Then I can come.

912
01:01:55,514 --> 01:01:57,514
You know what? Forget it.

913
01:01:57,516 --> 01:02:01,584
We'd just hack over the same shit anyway.
It's boring.

914
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:19,833
How do people's
lives come to this?

915
01:02:24,406 --> 01:02:27,140
I gotta tell you
something, Bobbie.

916
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:31,176
I love you.

917
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,446
I really do, but...

918
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:38,148
You can be

919
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:41,951
a stuck-up, arrogant son of a
bitch sometimes. You know that?

920
01:02:41,953 --> 01:02:43,152
I mean, you stopped
talking to me

921
01:02:43,154 --> 01:02:46,588
'cause I make a career
choice you don't approve of.

922
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:47,589
What kind of bullshit is that?

923
01:02:47,591 --> 01:02:50,058
That's not true, Paul.
You rejected me.

924
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,027
Oh, man, I rejected
Los Angeles.

925
01:02:53,496 --> 01:02:56,363
I couldn't live
your life out there.

926
01:02:56,498 --> 01:02:59,632
I needed my family.
I needed my friends.

927
01:03:00,201 --> 01:03:01,567
All you cared about
was business.

928
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,735
I was out there two weeks.

929
01:03:03,737 --> 01:03:07,038
We had dinner, what, twice?

930
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,640
Even then I felt like a client.

931
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:13,843
You could've had a job
starting at $60,000 a year.

932
01:03:13,845 --> 01:03:15,778
Instead, you chose
the junk business.

933
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,815
Scrap metal, Bobbie.
It's called scrap metal.

934
01:03:19,817 --> 01:03:22,651
It's junk.
It's always been junk.

935
01:03:22,653 --> 01:03:24,085
See, this is where we differ.

936
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:27,188
You always hated Dad
for being a junk man.

937
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:30,524
I always loved him
for being a hard worker.

938
01:03:30,526 --> 01:03:31,224
That's the difference.

939
01:03:31,226 --> 01:03:32,959
I never said I hated him.

940
01:03:32,961 --> 01:03:35,528
Yeah, Bobbie, you have.

941
01:03:36,364 --> 01:03:38,797
Well, okay,
let's forget the semantics.

942
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:42,400
Look, he's your dad
for God's sake. I mean...

943
01:03:43,169 --> 01:03:44,935
You used to bounce
up and down on his knee.

944
01:03:44,937 --> 01:03:47,370
You rode the train
together to Cleveland.

945
01:03:47,372 --> 01:03:50,840
I remember you used to talk about
that all the time as a kid,

946
01:03:50,842 --> 01:03:55,244
how he took you
on the Pullman car,

947
01:03:55,412 --> 01:03:56,244
just the two of you.

948
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:59,180
I still remember
the look in your eye.

949
01:04:00,983 --> 01:04:03,850
What happened
to that look, Bobbie?

950
01:04:07,388 --> 01:04:09,221
I don't know.

951
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:13,224
You know, it's funny,

952
01:04:13,993 --> 01:04:16,827
for all your complaining
about Dad,

953
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:21,164
I get the sense you're gonna
turn out just like him.

954
01:04:23,168 --> 01:04:25,701
Well, I gotta go in.
I really do.

955
01:04:25,703 --> 01:04:29,471
I'm leaving for my
honeymoon in half an hour.

956
01:04:46,623 --> 01:04:49,123
You gotta show it
to them too, Bobbie.

957
01:04:50,993 --> 01:04:52,726
Maybe one day.

958
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:56,930
They're not gonna be
around forever, you know.

959
01:05:07,876 --> 01:05:09,775
It's leaving.

960
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:13,244
Hey, wait!

961
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,846
What's the matter?

962
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:21,784
I blew it.

963
01:05:21,786 --> 01:05:24,720
Bob, come on. Come on.
The bus is leaving.

964
01:05:24,722 --> 01:05:26,121
I didn't resolve
anything, Gail.

965
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:28,990
Bob, come on. Let's go.

966
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,729
Are you all right?

967
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:39,198
This is my last trip home.

968
01:05:50,244 --> 01:05:52,210
It's not getting any better.

969
01:05:52,212 --> 01:05:55,112
You don't have to tell me.

970
01:05:55,114 --> 01:05:56,680
I can see.

971
01:05:56,682 --> 01:05:58,448
It's still there.

972
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,149
Right there.

973
01:06:00,151 --> 01:06:03,285
The anger. The fear.

974
01:06:03,487 --> 01:06:06,554
You are not
a very good student.

975
01:06:06,556 --> 01:06:09,490
Life is trying to teach you,

976
01:06:09,492 --> 01:06:11,158
but you don't listen.

977
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,827
Opportunities come
and you don't see them.

978
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:17,530
What are you talking about?
I did exactly what you said.

979
01:06:17,532 --> 01:06:20,799
I went to Detroit.
I went 2,000 miles.

980
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:22,100
I saw my parents.

981
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:24,769
I did not tell you
to see your parents.

982
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:28,405
I just said
you needed to forgive.

983
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:32,142
There is only one place
you need to go.

984
01:06:33,712 --> 01:06:34,977
Where?

985
01:06:34,979 --> 01:06:36,545
Your heart.

986
01:06:40,817 --> 01:06:43,150
Great. My heart.

987
01:06:45,154 --> 01:06:47,921
How exactly does one get there?

988
01:06:49,724 --> 01:06:52,991
Feel in the center
of your chest.

989
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,126
Imagine your finger
pushing into it,

990
01:06:56,128 --> 01:06:58,094
deeper and deeper.

991
01:06:58,096 --> 01:06:59,962
When you start to feel happy,

992
01:06:59,964 --> 01:07:03,532
you feel a sense of well-being,

993
01:07:03,767 --> 01:07:05,466
you are there.

994
01:07:05,468 --> 01:07:08,302
That is the place of love

995
01:07:08,304 --> 01:07:10,404
and forgiveness.

996
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,608
Go there. Soon.

997
01:07:18,045 --> 01:07:23,048
<i>¶ Some enchanted evening</i>

998
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:28,953
<i>¶ You may see a stranger</i>

999
01:07:30,222 --> 01:07:33,223
I'm seeing Dr. Mills tomorrow.

1000
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:37,426
I'm seeing Dr. Mills tomorrow.
I'm having the ultrasound.

1001
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,828
Just wanted to let you know.

1002
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,163
Oh. Okay.

1003
01:07:42,165 --> 01:07:45,933
<i>¶ You know even then</i>

1004
01:07:45,935 --> 01:07:50,237
<i>¶ That somewhere</i>
<i>you'll see her again and again</i>

1005
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:52,272
I'm sure everything's fine.

1006
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:57,376
Nice tune.

1007
01:07:58,512 --> 01:08:02,714
<i>¶ Some enchanted evening</i>

1008
01:08:03,283 --> 01:08:07,852
<i>¶ Someone may be laughing</i>

1009
01:08:07,854 --> 01:08:13,324
<i>¶ You may hear her laughing</i>
<i>across a crowded room ¶</i>

1010
01:08:13,326 --> 01:08:18,095
Does he belong to you? I found
him wandering in the hall.

1011
01:08:20,132 --> 01:08:21,064
Bob.

1012
01:08:21,066 --> 01:08:23,733
What are you doing here?

1013
01:08:24,202 --> 01:08:26,502
I was in
the neighborhood, so...

1014
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,671
I can't believe it. I...

1015
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:32,407
I can't believe you came.

1016
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,875
Come here.

1017
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:38,611
Oh, honey, thanks.

1018
01:08:39,113 --> 01:08:42,114
Are you changing
in your old age?

1019
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:48,519
Mr. Jones, I presume? Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Dr. Mills.

1020
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:49,620
Hi. How are you?

1021
01:08:49,622 --> 01:08:50,787
How are you, Gail?

1022
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:51,854
Oh, I'm fine.

1023
01:08:51,856 --> 01:08:56,959
Okay. Let's take a look at this
baby with the ultrasound machine.

1024
01:08:57,428 --> 01:08:58,894
It's been really active.

1025
01:08:58,896 --> 01:09:01,863
Perfectly normal.
This will be a little cold.

1026
01:09:01,865 --> 01:09:03,030
"A little cold"?

1027
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:07,934
Sorry. Would you like me
to videotape this for you?

1028
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,650
Yeah. Can you do that?

1029
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:13,704
Oh, wow.

1030
01:09:13,706 --> 01:09:16,273
Home movies before you're born.

1031
01:09:18,577 --> 01:09:21,978
Well, what do you think?

1032
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,747
What a beautiful profile.

1033
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:27,548
Oh, my God.

1034
01:09:28,484 --> 01:09:31,051
Oh, that's the heart.

1035
01:09:31,553 --> 01:09:32,485
Where?

1036
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:34,386
There. You see it?

1037
01:09:34,554 --> 01:09:37,421
That is a gorgeous baby.

1038
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:42,325
This is all very good.

1039
01:09:42,327 --> 01:09:44,026
You're in your 27th week,

1040
01:09:44,028 --> 01:09:46,395
and your baby's
right on schedule.

1041
01:09:46,397 --> 01:09:48,730
Look, it's sucking its thumb.

1042
01:09:48,732 --> 01:09:51,332
- That's what it's doing?
- Yeah.

1043
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,267
- My, oh, my.
- Look at that.

1044
01:09:54,269 --> 01:09:57,003
Do you wanna know
the baby's sex?

1045
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:01,106
Yeah. Right?

1046
01:10:01,174 --> 01:10:02,006
Yeah.

1047
01:10:02,008 --> 01:10:03,407
You have a son.

1048
01:10:03,976 --> 01:10:06,710
A beautiful,
healthy-looking son.

1049
01:10:06,712 --> 01:10:08,478
Oh, my God!

1050
01:10:08,947 --> 01:10:10,246
Really?

1051
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:12,281
How you know that?

1052
01:10:12,283 --> 01:10:15,083
Either that
or he's got three legs.

1053
01:10:18,421 --> 01:10:19,887
Geez.

1054
01:10:22,758 --> 01:10:24,424
A son.

1055
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:33,899
Geez, what are we gonna name him?
Did we even think of that?

1056
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,767
Mom wants to name him
after her father.

1057
01:10:35,769 --> 01:10:38,269
I'm drinking for two. Thanks.

1058
01:10:39,972 --> 01:10:42,272
Zachary? Are you crazy?

1059
01:10:42,274 --> 01:10:43,573
Zack.

1060
01:10:43,575 --> 01:10:46,976
Not me. No son of mine
is gonna be named Zack.

1061
01:10:46,978 --> 01:10:49,445
He'll get killed at school.

1062
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:51,747
What else starts with a Z?

1063
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:53,347
Zeus?

1064
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:55,649
Uh, Prometheus.

1065
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:58,318
Prometheus has a ring to it.

1066
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,552
Uh, Agamemnon.

1067
01:10:59,554 --> 01:11:00,754
Oh, cute.

1068
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:01,955
Odysseus.

1069
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:02,522
Uh...

1070
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:06,492
Forget the Greeks. Let's try
something, uh, Roman. Try Romans.

1071
01:11:06,494 --> 01:11:08,560
Roman, Roman... Julius.

1072
01:11:08,562 --> 01:11:10,895
Julius. Augustus. Augie.

1073
01:11:10,897 --> 01:11:12,663
Augie!

1074
01:11:12,765 --> 01:11:13,930
Jehoshaphat.

1075
01:11:13,932 --> 01:11:15,097
Something thinner.

1076
01:11:15,099 --> 01:11:16,698
Uh, Anorexis.

1077
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,332
That's a girl's name.

1078
01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:20,901
I didn't even know
that was a name.

1079
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:22,369
All right, uh, Morton.

1080
01:11:22,371 --> 01:11:24,571
Morton? That's terrible.

1081
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:25,471
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1082
01:11:25,473 --> 01:11:28,006
That was
a spontaneous emission,

1083
01:11:28,008 --> 01:11:29,607
so to speak.

1084
01:11:54,433 --> 01:11:57,367
You sure you want to do this?

1085
01:11:57,469 --> 01:11:59,168
I'm sure.

1086
01:11:59,336 --> 01:12:02,603
You're an amazing woman,
you know that?

1087
01:12:03,472 --> 01:12:06,206
I must be. I live with you.

1088
01:12:06,474 --> 01:12:08,841
Am I really that difficult?

1089
01:12:09,343 --> 01:12:11,443
Some things
you don't want to know.

1090
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:19,183
I love you.

1091
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:22,852
I love you, too.

1092
01:12:53,885 --> 01:12:55,150
Please, follow your shot.

1093
01:12:55,152 --> 01:12:57,085
Once you get in, box out.

1094
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,687
What do you do? Pump fake.

1095
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:01,055
Right. That way
you draw the foul.

1096
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:02,456
We have a lot of work
to do, tomorrow.

1097
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:05,959
We'll talk about boxing out
the man for the rebound.

1098
01:13:06,995 --> 01:13:09,028
Now, cooking spaghetti.

1099
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,962
Boil some water.

1100
01:13:09,964 --> 01:13:11,563
Salt it. Maybe
a little olive oil.

1101
01:13:11,565 --> 01:13:13,298
Slide the noodles in.

1102
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:16,000
You want them soft,
but not too soft.

1103
01:13:16,002 --> 01:13:17,301
Okay?

1104
01:13:17,736 --> 01:13:19,068
Now...

1105
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,503
Cooking in college.

1106
01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:24,138
Probably own one pot, right?

1107
01:13:27,076 --> 01:13:28,708
There you go, babe.

1108
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:32,712
There are basically two
schools of shaving, okay?

1109
01:13:32,714 --> 01:13:34,647
Down, like that,

1110
01:13:34,649 --> 01:13:36,815
or up, like that.

1111
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:42,620
Never, I repeat, never
sideways, like that. No.

1112
01:13:45,891 --> 01:13:48,691
Oh, a Raiders cap!

1113
01:13:49,093 --> 01:13:49,825
Oh, and look!

1114
01:13:49,827 --> 01:13:53,094
It's not for you, Bob.
Cutest little Raiders jacket.

1115
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:54,962
Oh, that's adorable!

1116
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:57,698
Thanks, guys. Wait a minute.
Look what else is in there.

1117
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:58,432
What?

1118
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,100
Oh, this, a jock.

1119
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:03,503
That's so sweet.

1120
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:07,273
Now let's try the same
breathing on our side.

1121
01:14:07,275 --> 01:14:08,173
Everyone turn over.

1122
01:14:08,175 --> 01:14:12,410
Daddies, this is a good time
to practice your massage.

1123
01:14:12,845 --> 01:14:16,813
Okay, now, daddies.
Keep it gentle but firm.

1124
01:14:16,815 --> 01:14:20,383
Very good.
Right on the lower back.

1125
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:22,551
Good.

1126
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,419
Is it working?

1127
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:26,620
No.

1128
01:14:26,622 --> 01:14:28,788
Oh, just what I needed to hear.

1129
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:31,890
Do you want me to stop?

1130
01:14:31,892 --> 01:14:33,291
No.

1131
01:14:33,293 --> 01:14:35,860
Careful. Don't hyperventilate.

1132
01:14:36,629 --> 01:14:39,563
So, tell me, is this breathing
all a load of crap?

1133
01:14:39,565 --> 01:14:42,432
Well, you know,

1134
01:14:42,434 --> 01:14:45,668
it's better than screaming.

1135
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:48,137
Oh. Great.

1136
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:57,443
Hurry. The line's not too long.

1137
01:14:57,445 --> 01:14:58,977
It's been over 30 years.

1138
01:14:58,979 --> 01:15:01,446
It's time I tried it
again, I think.

1139
01:15:01,448 --> 01:15:04,048
Well, maybe you should
start on the Tilt-A-Whirl.

1140
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:04,648
No, no, no.

1141
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:08,151
I'm going right into the core
of fear, the heart of darkness.

1142
01:15:08,153 --> 01:15:10,253
Wish I could go with you.

1143
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:13,456
Some things you just
gotta do alone, hon.

1144
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,096
Good luck.

1145
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:47,487
You ever been
on a coaster before?

1146
01:15:47,489 --> 01:15:50,857
Not since I was six.
I've been too afraid.

1147
01:15:51,025 --> 01:15:52,624
You're kidding.

1148
01:15:52,626 --> 01:15:54,826
And now you pick "the Serpent"?

1149
01:15:54,828 --> 01:15:58,362
If you really wanna
do it right, let go.

1150
01:15:58,964 --> 01:15:59,896
You crazy?

1151
01:15:59,898 --> 01:16:02,565
You won't fall out. Trust me.

1152
01:16:02,567 --> 01:16:05,935
This is what I trust.
Right here.

1153
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:08,436
Yeah!

1154
01:16:15,177 --> 01:16:16,776
Yeah!

1155
01:16:30,057 --> 01:16:31,122
How much more?

1156
01:16:31,124 --> 01:16:34,125
Plenty! Ha ha!

1157
01:16:34,794 --> 01:16:36,760
But... Oh!

1158
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:49,939
Just a few more drops,
but really great ones!

1159
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,520
You can let go now.

1160
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,957
My hero.

1161
01:17:15,595 --> 01:17:17,328
Hey, you did it.

1162
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:18,662
A snap.

1163
01:17:18,664 --> 01:17:21,765
Here you go. Thanks. Thanks.

1164
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:27,737
You know what today is?

1165
01:17:27,739 --> 01:17:28,804
No. What?

1166
01:17:28,806 --> 01:17:29,905
D-Day.

1167
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:31,306
"D-Day"?

1168
01:17:32,809 --> 01:17:34,542
It's death day.

1169
01:17:36,345 --> 01:17:38,945
I was supposed
to be dead by today.

1170
01:17:40,214 --> 01:17:41,746
Oh, Bob.

1171
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:46,083
We're living on borrowed time.

1172
01:18:52,784 --> 01:18:56,252
Okay, now, the important thing to
remember about jumping another car

1173
01:18:56,254 --> 01:18:59,288
is to put the cables
in the right place.

1174
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:01,623
Positive to positive.
Negative to negative.

1175
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:05,126
Or you can ground it here by
putting it on metal. Okay?

1176
01:19:05,128 --> 01:19:08,028
And don't go goofing around with these things.
Okay? They're not toys.

1177
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,797
All right? You don't, you
know, put 'em together,

1178
01:19:10,799 --> 01:19:12,632
they make some pretty cool
sparks, but don't do that.

1179
01:19:12,634 --> 01:19:15,534
Don't goose your buddies with
'em or anything like that.

1180
01:19:15,536 --> 01:19:16,368
Just ask your Uncle Paul.

1181
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:19,504
Ask him about the time
we were playing Frankenstein.

1182
01:19:22,742 --> 01:19:24,241
Sex.

1183
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,250
Walking into a room,

1184
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:36,619
correct way and the wrong way.

1185
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:37,453
Correct way. With confidence,

1186
01:19:37,455 --> 01:19:40,422
right to the person
you're about to address.

1187
01:19:40,724 --> 01:19:43,825
"Tom. Brian. Brian Jones."

1188
01:19:43,827 --> 01:19:45,359
Right there, okay?

1189
01:19:45,361 --> 01:19:45,992
One line.

1190
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:48,627
You can even start the handshake
up here if you want to.

1191
01:19:48,629 --> 01:19:51,463
You can go that early
if you want to.

1192
01:19:51,531 --> 01:19:53,063
Never.

1193
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:00,003
"Oh, hi."

1194
01:20:00,005 --> 01:20:01,237
Never. Okay?

1195
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:04,039
Now, if you can do this...

1196
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:06,708
"Hi, Brian. Brian Jones."

1197
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:09,010
Do it. But ever since Cary
Grant and Fred Astaire died,

1198
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:12,079
there are very few guys
who can pull that off.

1199
01:20:15,117 --> 01:20:16,549
Bob?

1200
01:20:16,617 --> 01:20:18,249
Huh? It's time.

1201
01:20:18,251 --> 01:20:19,083
What?

1202
01:20:19,085 --> 01:20:20,918
My contractions have started.

1203
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:21,852
I can't hear you. What?

1204
01:20:21,854 --> 01:20:23,753
I'm having contractions.

1205
01:20:23,755 --> 01:20:24,620
Your contraption, what?

1206
01:20:24,622 --> 01:20:28,457
We're having a baby. Now?

1207
01:20:31,495 --> 01:20:33,995
Oh, damn! What are you doing?

1208
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:35,396
I forgot the camera. Oh.

1209
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:37,131
This is great. That's it.

1210
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:40,601
Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay, okay. How you doin'?
Good. That's it.

1211
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:42,369
Can you turn this way
a little, honey?

1212
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:45,839
Turn that fucking thing off!

1213
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,510
Oh. I love you.

1214
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:53,412
I love you so much.

1215
01:20:53,414 --> 01:20:56,882
Oh. How's that?

1216
01:20:56,884 --> 01:21:00,919
Oh, great. Ooh, I... Ah.

1217
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:02,720
It's coming. Oh, my back!

1218
01:21:02,722 --> 01:21:05,155
You okay? You all right? Yeah.

1219
01:21:05,157 --> 01:21:07,991
Okay. Remember,
breathe, honey, breathe.

1220
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,892
That's it. Relax.

1221
01:21:09,894 --> 01:21:11,460
Relax. Just go with it.
Just go with it.

1222
01:21:11,462 --> 01:21:14,863
Let it happen. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Oh, I can't. It hurts.

1223
01:21:14,865 --> 01:21:17,732
Relax. Breathe,
breathe, breathe.

1224
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:21,268
Breathe, breathe, breathe, relax.
That's it.

1225
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:24,104
Shut up!
Okay, all right. Sorry.

1226
01:21:24,106 --> 01:21:27,273
- How's everyone doin'?
- I don't know.

1227
01:21:27,275 --> 01:21:29,775
Ah, yeah.

1228
01:21:29,777 --> 01:21:33,445
- Hi, Gail.
- Oh. Mmm.

1229
01:21:33,914 --> 01:21:36,147
How we doin'?
Well, everything's fine,

1230
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:38,916
but her contractions
are getting further apart.

1231
01:21:38,918 --> 01:21:40,918
We need for them
to be closer together

1232
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,686
and more regular to make progress.
Right.

1233
01:21:42,688 --> 01:21:45,422
I'd like to start pitocin,
which will increase

1234
01:21:45,424 --> 01:21:46,656
the strength and frequency
of the contractions.

1235
01:21:46,658 --> 01:21:48,591
Good idea. Good idea. Increase?
What do you mean, increase?

1236
01:21:48,593 --> 01:21:50,559
Are you crazy? What are you talking...
Are you nuts?

1237
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:52,928
It'll speed things along.

1238
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:53,895
It's gonna speed it up, honey.

1239
01:21:53,897 --> 01:21:57,298
Doc says it's just gonna
speed it up. Okay.

1240
01:21:59,168 --> 01:22:01,535
Hey, Doctor! How do you
think it's goin' in there?

1241
01:22:01,537 --> 01:22:04,471
Everything's just fine. No, seriously.
How do you think it's goin'?

1242
01:22:04,473 --> 01:22:07,173
Everything's just fine. Yeah?

1243
01:22:07,175 --> 01:22:10,643
Go back in. Help her relax.
Okay.

1244
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:20,884
Oh, I love you, honey.
I love you so much.

1245
01:22:20,886 --> 01:22:21,885
- Bob, grab your camera.
- What?

1246
01:22:21,887 --> 01:22:27,257
The baby's head is crowning. How often
do you get to see your baby being born?

1247
01:22:28,059 --> 01:22:29,425
- Can you hold her?
- Sure.

1248
01:22:29,427 --> 01:22:31,360
Okay, Gail.

1249
01:22:31,362 --> 01:22:36,798
I know that it hurts, I know that it's
hard, but I know you can do this.

1250
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,866
Oh, God!

1251
01:22:41,604 --> 01:22:45,072
Ahhh! The head is out.

1252
01:22:45,074 --> 01:22:47,107
Whoa!

1253
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:49,642
What about, uh...

1254
01:22:49,644 --> 01:22:51,710
You know... The rest?

1255
01:22:51,712 --> 01:22:55,513
Last time. I promise. No more than this.
We're almost there.

1256
01:22:55,515 --> 01:22:57,982
I'll need you to push one more time.
Where's the baby? What?

1257
01:22:57,984 --> 01:23:00,417
Push one more time. We have to
get this baby out. Not one more.

1258
01:23:00,419 --> 01:23:02,552
Yes, one more time. You can do it.
Not one more.

1259
01:23:02,554 --> 01:23:03,486
No, I don't have...
Honey, I can't!

1260
01:23:03,488 --> 01:23:04,587
Come on, honey. Yes, you can.

1261
01:23:04,589 --> 01:23:06,155
I know you can, come on.
You're doing marvelously well.

1262
01:23:06,157 --> 01:23:08,090
Push one more time.
Come on. Yes, you can.

1263
01:23:08,092 --> 01:23:10,859
Yeah, you can.
You're doin' so great.

1264
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:13,027
Oh, I need to...

1265
01:23:13,029 --> 01:23:16,563
Oh! One more. Just one more.

1266
01:23:16,565 --> 01:23:19,365
Ah. One more.

1267
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:34,212
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

1268
01:23:34,214 --> 01:23:37,448
Oh, my God.

1269
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:40,317
Where's the baby? Where is he?

1270
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:42,552
Oh!

1271
01:23:42,554 --> 01:23:45,187
Here's your handsome son.

1272
01:23:45,756 --> 01:23:47,956
Oh, hello!

1273
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,992
Hello, little one.

1274
01:23:50,994 --> 01:23:54,195
Yes. Oh.

1275
01:23:54,897 --> 01:23:57,530
Sweetheart.

1276
01:23:57,532 --> 01:24:00,099
You're so beautiful.

1277
01:24:02,036 --> 01:24:03,969
We have a baby.

1278
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:07,072
Grab your camera.

1279
01:24:07,474 --> 01:24:10,775
Oh.

1280
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:13,744
Hey.

1281
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,647
Here we are. Oh! Sorry, hon! Oh!

1282
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:21,417
Oh, sorry.
Here, could you do this?

1283
01:24:22,386 --> 01:24:26,855
Look through the thing
and just get my kid, my wife.

1284
01:24:26,857 --> 01:24:28,923
- Kid, wife.
- You did great.

1285
01:24:28,925 --> 01:24:33,994
Thanks. Oh, her.
Oh, you did great.

1286
01:24:33,996 --> 01:24:36,029
You did great. Hi, sweetie.

1287
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,032
Oh.

1288
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:43,334
He's gorgeous!

1289
01:24:44,804 --> 01:24:47,371
Thank you.

1290
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,155
- Come on.
- Oh, good burp.

1291
01:25:08,225 --> 01:25:11,659
He's drunk.

1292
01:25:11,661 --> 01:25:14,294
Been drinking.

1293
01:25:15,864 --> 01:25:17,763
Honey, he's just eaten.
He's gonna throw up.

1294
01:25:17,765 --> 01:25:19,931
No, no, no, no. He likes it.

1295
01:25:19,933 --> 01:25:23,234
Yeah. You like
your daddy, don't you?

1296
01:25:30,242 --> 01:25:32,275
Oops! What's that
you're puttin' on him?

1297
01:25:32,277 --> 01:25:34,010
It's just the soap.
Take it easy.

1298
01:25:34,012 --> 01:25:37,279
All right.
Ooh, ow, ooh! Yikes! Gee!

1299
01:25:37,281 --> 01:25:42,884
Easy! Easy there! Oh! Yo!

1300
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:46,253
Yeah. Yeah.

1301
01:25:46,255 --> 01:25:48,321
Yeah. Yeah.

1302
01:25:48,323 --> 01:25:50,189
Here we go. Okay. Come on.

1303
01:25:50,191 --> 01:25:51,190
Shit!

1304
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:53,392
Bob. Sorry. I'm sorry, honey.

1305
01:25:53,394 --> 01:25:53,959
Yeah.

1306
01:25:53,961 --> 01:25:55,694
Here we go. Smile. Smile.
Is he smiling?

1307
01:25:55,696 --> 01:25:57,162
One more. He's smiling.
Okay. Yeah!

1308
01:25:57,164 --> 01:25:58,062
Damn!

1309
01:25:58,064 --> 01:26:02,132
Honey. Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay. Here we go.

1310
01:26:02,134 --> 01:26:03,933
Get ready.

1311
01:26:03,935 --> 01:26:07,436
Okay. Okay. Okay. Ready?

1312
01:26:08,071 --> 01:26:10,037
Did it click? I didn't hear it.

1313
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:12,439
The red light on?

1314
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:14,207
Aw. Aw!

1315
01:26:14,209 --> 01:26:16,042
Sweetie, your hand.
I can't see his face.

1316
01:26:16,044 --> 01:26:18,644
Oh, sorry. Put it
in the other hand.

1317
01:26:18,646 --> 01:26:20,646
Wait a minute. Right. Yeah.

1318
01:26:20,648 --> 01:26:22,681
Oh. Oh. You can't... Oh.

1319
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:26,251
I'm sorry. Here. Wait.
Gimme... Okay.

1320
01:26:26,253 --> 01:26:29,320
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about that.

1321
01:26:29,322 --> 01:26:31,922
Here. If this makes you
feel any better, there.

1322
01:26:31,924 --> 01:26:35,825
How's that? Now we're even.

1323
01:26:35,927 --> 01:26:39,295
<i>¶ Da-da-da-da Da-da-da-da</i>

1324
01:26:39,297 --> 01:26:42,865
<i>¶ Da-da-da-da Whoo! ¶</i>

1325
01:27:06,122 --> 01:27:07,354
Bobbie!

1326
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:12,359
You gonna take every second
of this baby's life?

1327
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:16,829
Too much. You're a scallywag,
that's what you are.

1328
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,430
Say, "Bye, Daddy. Bye."

1329
01:27:23,169 --> 01:27:24,735
See? See how he can go around there?
You watching?

1330
01:27:24,737 --> 01:27:27,938
See, you can do that. Here, wait, wait, wait.
Gonna stop this thing. There.

1331
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:33,109
Right there. Right where that kid's feet go.
Right there, one in front of the other.

1332
01:27:33,111 --> 01:27:34,677
Watch, Brian. One. See?

1333
01:27:34,679 --> 01:27:39,048
Now one... Go ahead, do it. One
in front of the other. Go, go.

1334
01:27:44,055 --> 01:27:48,057
You think he'll sleep? Oh, yeah.
He's exhausted.

1335
01:27:48,059 --> 01:27:53,695
Yeah? Look at him.
I don't get it.

1336
01:27:54,431 --> 01:27:55,496
Why's he so happy?

1337
01:27:55,498 --> 01:27:59,433
It's not like he's got a Mercedes
and a great job or anything.

1338
01:27:59,435 --> 01:28:03,036
Maybe he's just happy
being alive.

1339
01:28:03,038 --> 01:28:06,572
Doesn't that make him some
kind of mutant or something?

1340
01:28:06,574 --> 01:28:07,739
That makes him your son.

1341
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:12,643
What does that mean?
He's learning it from you.

1342
01:28:18,017 --> 01:28:19,883
I love you, Gail.

1343
01:28:22,554 --> 01:28:25,054
I know.

1344
01:28:30,961 --> 01:28:35,463
See you in the morning.
Go to sleep.

1345
01:28:38,334 --> 01:28:40,967
Ah! Bob!

1346
01:28:40,969 --> 01:28:43,436
I'm afraid the cancer
has spread to the brain.

1347
01:28:43,438 --> 01:28:48,641
This is not uncommon with kidney cancer.
It's very opportunistic.

1348
01:28:48,643 --> 01:28:52,611
The miracle is that you've
managed to survive this long.

1349
01:28:52,613 --> 01:28:56,348
I don't know what has kept you
alive, but a man in your condition

1350
01:28:56,350 --> 01:29:00,218
should not be sitting
across from me right now.

1351
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:05,456
Traditionally, a brain tumor of
this size progresses very quickly.

1352
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:10,194
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

1353
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:13,830
There is really
very little time left.

1354
01:29:17,869 --> 01:29:20,069
What, a month?

1355
01:29:20,071 --> 01:29:23,005
Two? With luck.

1356
01:29:23,273 --> 01:29:25,473
We can hospitalize you
if you wish, but in truth,

1357
01:29:25,475 --> 01:29:28,242
hospice care can be
equally effective

1358
01:29:28,244 --> 01:29:31,578
and you can stay in the
comfort of your own home.

1359
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:34,213
I'll be happy to recommend
a service for you.

1360
01:29:34,215 --> 01:29:39,518
I should warn you that you will
probably develop muscle weakness.

1361
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,455
Walking and lifting things may
become difficult for you.

1362
01:29:43,457 --> 01:29:47,625
That's why it's a good idea to
have professional help around.

1363
01:29:47,627 --> 01:29:51,395
I'd also like
to begin a series...

1364
01:30:05,811 --> 01:30:08,411
That light.

1365
01:30:09,313 --> 01:30:11,413
I keep seeing that light.

1366
01:30:11,415 --> 01:30:14,716
What is it?
Why do I keep seeing it?

1367
01:30:14,718 --> 01:30:17,952
That is the light of the self.

1368
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:20,020
It is the source of life,

1369
01:30:20,022 --> 01:30:23,890
the source of all healing.

1370
01:30:23,892 --> 01:30:26,959
Does that mean it's working?

1371
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:29,895
Can it heal my tumor?

1372
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:34,165
It's going too fast.

1373
01:30:35,535 --> 01:30:38,702
So there isn't anything?

1374
01:30:38,704 --> 01:30:41,271
What can I do?

1375
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:48,677
Put your house in order.

1376
01:30:51,748 --> 01:30:54,381
Find peace.

1377
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:58,117
Oh, shit!

1378
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,886
Ow!

1379
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:03,154
Would someone get that?

1380
01:31:07,294 --> 01:31:09,894
Mom, can you get the door?

1381
01:31:20,372 --> 01:31:25,341
Does anybody hear that?

1382
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:29,778
Come on. That... Oh.

1383
01:31:32,849 --> 01:31:35,649
Well, no need to ask
who the patient is.

1384
01:31:35,651 --> 01:31:38,018
You're Bob, I assume? Yeah.

1385
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:41,421
And you're the wife. Are you Gail?
Yeah, I'm Gail.

1386
01:31:41,423 --> 01:31:45,892
I'm Theresa, the hospice nurse.
Dr. Altman referred me?

1387
01:31:45,894 --> 01:31:47,760
Oh, yeah. Can I come in?

1388
01:31:47,762 --> 01:31:50,696
Yeah. Sure.

1389
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:58,936
We're gonna need
a walker, aren't we?

1390
01:31:58,938 --> 01:32:01,171
I'll bring one over
this afternoon.

1391
01:32:01,173 --> 01:32:03,373
Now, Dr. Altman
filled me in on everything.

1392
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:08,678
I just want you to know we're gonna
help you in every way we can.

1393
01:32:16,087 --> 01:32:18,020
There we go. You got it. See?

1394
01:32:18,022 --> 01:32:21,390
Balance, lift, step.
Don't forget.

1395
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:24,191
Hey, this is hard.

1396
01:32:24,193 --> 01:32:27,093
Nobody said Olympic
training was gonna be easy.

1397
01:32:27,095 --> 01:32:28,561
Come on. You can do it.

1398
01:32:28,563 --> 01:32:31,931
You're doin' fine.
Just take your time.

1399
01:32:56,057 --> 01:32:58,090
No. Come on now. None of that.

1400
01:32:58,092 --> 01:33:03,161
We'll just lay you down in the
den, that's all. No big deal.

1401
01:33:04,564 --> 01:33:07,164
All right, that'll do it. That's
all there is to it. Thanks.

1402
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:10,033
Thanks. I'll show you out.

1403
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:11,634
Bye.

1404
01:33:49,406 --> 01:33:51,172
I want him in my bed.

1405
01:33:51,174 --> 01:33:54,742
You can stay
with him downstairs.

1406
01:33:55,711 --> 01:33:59,612
It's not the same. I know.

1407
01:34:03,985 --> 01:34:06,585
Oh, Mom.

1408
01:34:14,995 --> 01:34:20,164
So this friend of mine
introduces me to your mother.

1409
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:22,533
And at first,

1410
01:34:22,535 --> 01:34:25,936
nothing in me responded to her.

1411
01:34:26,405 --> 01:34:30,206
Maybe I was intimidated
by how beautiful she was.

1412
01:34:30,775 --> 01:34:32,975
I kept saying to myself,

1413
01:34:32,977 --> 01:34:36,011
"She's too tall, too skinny.

1414
01:34:36,013 --> 01:34:39,948
"She knows too much
about public relations."

1415
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:42,784
But she had, uh,

1416
01:34:42,786 --> 01:34:47,288
compassion,
and she was really open.

1417
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:52,726
Even then, though,
I didn't think it was love.

1418
01:34:53,095 --> 01:34:57,730
I just liked her.
I just really liked her.

1419
01:35:00,401 --> 01:35:02,901
She made me feel good.

1420
01:35:02,903 --> 01:35:07,605
And I felt whole, somehow.

1421
01:35:09,308 --> 01:35:12,709
Then one day I woke up,

1422
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:15,912
and I realized,

1423
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,683
I love this woman.

1424
01:35:21,452 --> 01:35:26,788
Just hit me. I just love her.

1425
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:35,328
So, I guess
what I've learned is,

1426
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:41,334
liking someone is just as
important as loving them.

1427
01:35:41,336 --> 01:35:46,472
And if you like somebody
long enough,

1428
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:49,241
and enough enough,

1429
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:52,510
you learn what love is, too.

1430
01:35:57,083 --> 01:36:00,517
So... That's it.

1431
01:36:00,952 --> 01:36:03,185
What do you think?

1432
01:36:03,187 --> 01:36:07,923
I... I think
I'm gonna throw up.

1433
01:36:08,892 --> 01:36:13,294
Really? Let me tell you about
this other girl in Detroit.

1434
01:36:13,296 --> 01:36:15,896
You!

1435
01:36:15,898 --> 01:36:19,232
Oh, sure. Now you
wanna kiss me.

It's the middle of the night.

1439

You gotta get some sleep.

1440
01:36:39,785 --> 01:36:43,653
I don't wanna go to sleep. What do
you mean you don't wanna sleep?

1441
01:36:43,655 --> 01:36:47,156
Just try.
Uh-uh. I don't want to.

1442
01:36:47,891 --> 01:36:51,359
Just a nap. How you
gonna keep your strength?

1443
01:36:51,361 --> 01:36:53,961
Strength?

1444
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:56,763
I can't even brush my teeth.

1445
01:36:56,765 --> 01:37:00,199
I know you're having trouble sleeping,
but could you turn it down a tad?

you're so beautiful.

- He's chunky.
- He looks strong!

1516
01:42:22,967 --> 01:42:25,367
He looks just like Bobbie
when Bobbie was a baby.

1517
01:42:25,369 --> 01:42:29,337
Yeah. He look like Bobbie.
Just look at you.

1518
01:42:29,339 --> 01:42:31,372
I can't believe
you got on a plane.

1519
01:42:31,374 --> 01:42:34,308
She was only conscious
for a part of it.

Oh, never mind. They're
making fun of your grandma.

1521
01:42:38,681 --> 01:42:41,648
Yeah. What?

1522
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:44,617

1529
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:33,358
You'll see.

1530
01:43:36,495 --> 01:43:38,161
Okay.

1532
01:43:45,935 --> 01:43:48,669
Oh!

1533
01:43:49,004 --> 01:43:51,371
Ah, hup! Hup!

1534
01:43:51,373 --> 01:43:54,173

1535
01:43:56,977 --> 01:43:59,444
What... What is this?
Who did this?

1536
01:43:59,446 --> 01:44:02,814
Your parents. They
wanted to do something.

1537

1538

01:44:35,278 --> 01:44:40,547
Toro, hup! No, no, down!
Hup! Hup! Hup!

1541
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:44,116
Where's Brian?

1542
01:44:44,118 --> 01:44:46,685
Here you go.

1543
01:44:59,065 --> 01:45:04,034
Don't forget this.
Don't ever forget this.

1544
01:45:09,241 --> 01:45:12,542
Hey, Brian?

1545
01:45:16,214 --> 01:45:18,948
I was just downstairs,

1546
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:22,718
thinkin' about some things.

1547
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:27,154
I thought
I'd come up here and...

1548
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:31,057
Have a talk with you,
man-to-man.

1549
01:45:34,862 --> 01:45:36,695
Listen.

1550
01:45:36,697 --> 01:45:40,598
This whole, uh, dying thing,

1551
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,300
not my idea.

1552
01:45:43,568 --> 01:45:48,037
Sometimes, stuff just happens.

1553
01:45:51,275 --> 01:45:54,342
You know, my brother was right.

1554
01:45:54,344 --> 01:45:59,046
I could've turned out
just like my father.

1555
01:46:01,116 --> 01:46:03,716
He was really a good guy,

1556
01:46:03,718 --> 01:46:08,620
but he worked all the time,
and he wasn't around too much.

1557
01:46:12,926 --> 01:46:17,762
You would've spent
your whole life being angry.

1558
01:46:18,765 --> 01:46:21,398
You don't wanna do that.

1559
01:46:23,835 --> 01:46:26,869
You'd have never
known me, Brian.

1560
01:46:27,071 --> 01:46:33,175
I don't want you
to feel bad about me dying.

1561
01:46:35,746 --> 01:46:40,181
Dying's a really hard way
to learn about life.

1562
01:46:40,616 --> 01:46:43,450
That's what happened.

1563
01:46:49,324 --> 01:46:53,693
Boy, I'm so grateful

1564
01:46:53,695 --> 01:46:57,363
for all this time
I've had with you.

1565
01:46:57,865 --> 01:47:04,703
'Cause it's absolutely the
happiest I've ever, ever been.

1566
01:47:11,878 --> 01:47:14,778
Nice to meet you, Brian.

1567
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:51,246
Good.

1568
01:47:52,983 --> 01:47:54,749
One more? No, no more.

1569
01:47:54,751 --> 01:47:58,519
No? Definitely not? Definitely.

1570
01:47:59,855 --> 01:48:02,155
Okay.

1571
01:48:10,565 --> 01:48:13,065
It's happening so fast.

1572
01:48:13,067 --> 01:48:14,366
It's a blessing.

1573
