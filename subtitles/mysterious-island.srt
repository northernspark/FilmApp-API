2
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,071
All right, get down.

3
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,288
- Where's his papers?
- They're all here.

4
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,083
Don't worry, Sergeant.
You'll find them all in order.

5
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,461
All right. Get in there!

6
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,505
Is that necessary?

7
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,425
- All I want is a nice, dry prison cell.
- Get moving!

8
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,819
Is the balloon still there, Captain?

9
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,203
It's whipping around a bit,
but still waiting for us.

10
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,163
We'll need your blanket, Neb.

11
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,456
Captain?

12
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,001
I think the kid is scared.

13
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,257
Well, aren't you?

14
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,975
- You want a hand with that?
- No, sir.

15
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,851
I've got them both almost through.

16
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:51,731
Captain, do you think that balloon will fly
in a big wind like this without busting open?

17
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,694
That's not the problem, Herbert. The
problem is whether it'll fly at all.

18
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,489
Captain?

19
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,994
We've never seen more than
the top of it over the houses.

20
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,621
What if there's a whole regiment guarding it?

21
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,416
We'll just have to fight
the whole regiment, Herbert.

22
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,186
Hey, Captain.

23
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,065
They're coming early.

24
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,654
Are we going through with it?

25
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,990
We've got no choice.

26
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,728
I see I shall have company. How charming!

27
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,022
Won't you introduce me to these gentlemen?

28
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,440
Come on, prisoner.

29
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,048
Get their clothes.

30
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,719
Here.

31
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,391
- Here are the keys.
- Now, you both know what to do.

32
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,518
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,478
Come on, get out of here.

34
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,295
Halt!

35
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,438
Hurry up!

36
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,942
Come on!

37
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,633
Wait!

38
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,023
Don't let me fall!

39
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,580
Lighten the basket. We've got to gain height.

40
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,811
You all right?

41
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,982
Hey, Captain.

42
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,675
All right, let's get this rebel out of here.

43
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,521
That's a mighty long drop.

44
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,899
You sure you know everything
about running this balloon?

45
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,235
Maybe this man could help us.

46
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,947
All right. Tie him up.

47
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,174
Now that we're up here, I suppose
we should introduce ourselves.

48
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,595
- Captain Cyrus Harding.
- Captain, look, food.

49
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,348
This is Neb. Union soldier.

50
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,853
- I'm Herbert Brown, Pennsylvania Infantry.
- Watch it!

51
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,480
Don't all crowd to one side.

52
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,736
I know what uniform that is.

53
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,530
You're a Union war correspondent.

54
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,699
Very observant, young man.

55
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,452
<i>Gideon Spilett, New York Herald.</i>

56
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:21,579
How much food is in that box, Neb?

57
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:26,876
Enough for five days, maybe. Four
if Mr. Spilett decides to stay.

58
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:30,129
That all depends, of course,
on where you're headed.

59
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,090
Wherever the wind takes us, Mr. Spilett.

60
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,095
Looks like your other guest is coming around.

61
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,683
You're my prisoner.
What's your name and rank?

62
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,186
Sergeant Pencroft.

63
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,771
Regiment?

64
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,776
Confederate Army. That's
all you'll get out of me.

65
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,988
Now listen, soldier. You
ever seen a burial at sea?

66
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,033
Well, you're dressed for one.

67
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,870
Only we're not over the sea. We're
over land, and about a mile up.

68
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,371
It's a long way up, Sergeant.

69
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,916
What these warriors are
trying to say, Sergeant...

70
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,461
...is that if you know anything about
running this thing, you can stay.

71
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,421
Otherwise...

72
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,092
I can work it.

73
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,970
Do you mean you can bring
this thing down when you like?

74
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,390
I can bring you down,
but not necessarily alive.

75
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,437
The way this wind is running, we'll
smash to a pulp when we hit land.

76
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,981
You offering parole?

77
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,858
That's all, rebel.

78
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,612
All right, then. Now hear my terms.

79
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,990
This gale is blowing due west.

80
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,536
Now, maybe we could come down
in your lines, and maybe in mine.

81
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,623
Whichever it is, nobody is anybody's
prisoner when we touch land.

82
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,124
Do you understand?

83
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,378
We all go our own way, and
we don't discuss politics.

84
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:59,260
Otherwise, Yankees, you can just let
this gale blow you to kingdom come.

85
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,181
All right, cut him loose.

86
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,851
Congratulations, Captain.

87
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,693
<i>This was just the beginning.</i>

88
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:20,865
<i>We escaped, but only into the clutches
of the greatest storm in American history.</i>

89
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,995
<i>Below us, when we could still see
through the patches of angry clouds...</i>

90
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,166
<i>...were smashed cities and
forests torn up by their roots.</i>

91
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>Then finally, the Earth
disappeared from our view.</i>

92
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:41,343
<i>We were prisoners of the wind,
helpless in the storm's mighty grip.</i>

93
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,056
<i>And we wondered how much
longer would we remain aloft?</i>

94
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,977
<i>Would we ever set foot on the Earth again?</i>

95
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,786
Hey, Captain...

96
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,414
Westward, Neb, still westward.

97
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,042
It's been four days.

98
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,261
Hey, looks like water.

99
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,890
It could be a lake.

100
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,101
Well, it's too big to be a river.

101
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,937
It's too big for either.

102
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,731
Must be the ocean.

103
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,568
Pencroft, take us down and
we'll have a closer look.

104
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,343
It can't be the Pacific.

105
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,303
It can't be anything else.

106
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:51,265
You mean we've been carried
clear across America?

107
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,641
It looks like it.

108
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,853
Captain, aren't we coming down awfully fast?

109
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,564
Pencroft, close the valve.

110
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:05,821
It's stuck!

111
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,869
We're going to hit the water and drown!

112
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,954
Can't you do something?

113
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,624
Get your hands off that rope!
It's caught across the opening.

114
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,334
Someone's got to get up there!

115
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,879
- I'm going up.
- No! Lighten the balloon.

116
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,797
Chuck out the rest of the sandbags.

117
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,594
Hurry, Captain. Hurry!

118
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,893
The valve, Captain!

119
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,190
Turn that valve, Captain!

120
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,493
Harder!

121
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,081
No, not that way!

122
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,708
No!

123
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:22,356
Thank you, Pencroft. I'm glad
I decided to let you stay.

124
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,567
Not you, Captain. It's this
valve bar you broke off.

125
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,862
- Hey, we're not dropping anymore.
- No, I got it closed.

126
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,491
You closed it permanently.
We can't get down anymore.

127
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,868
This was the only control we had.

128
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:35,470
Captain, the balloon, it's tearing open.

129
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,182
Everything! Throw out everything!

130
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,309
Throw out the food, too?

131
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,603
Food, clothes, everything loose.

132
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,777
We're still dropping, Mr. Spilett.

133
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,447
I suppose you'll want us to
volunteer to go over the side next.

134
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,034
Listen!

135
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,706
It sounds like waves breaking on the shore.

136
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,541
Land!

137
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,001
Where?

138
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,919
Dead ahead, there.

139
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,214
We'll never stay up long enough to get there.

140
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:14,342
Everybody up on the ring.
Cut the basket loose.

141
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,012
- What for?
- The man's right.

142
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:21,183
There might be enough gas in the
balloon to keep us afloat on the water.

143
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,685
Come on.

144
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,816
Get up there.

145
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,484
I can't.

146
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:36,698
Now look, you climb or you
drown, soldier. Now get up there!

147
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:46,124
All right. Now cut it off at these ropes.

148
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:25,914
Captain!

149
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,279
- I'm swimming in.
- You'd better not!

150
00:19:58,571 --> 00:19:59,989
That's the way I'm going.

151
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,282
No!

152
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:33,148
Captain Harding! Captain Harding!

153
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:39,028
Captain Harding! It's me, Neb.

154
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,509
Did you see anything, Neb?

155
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,887
No. How about you?

156
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,557
Nothing. We went about a mile
beyond where he dropped off.

157
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,226
- Not a sign.
- Maybe he's a bit further up that way.

158
00:21:10,351 --> 00:21:14,606
He'd have to be the best swimmer
in the world to get even this far.

159
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,108
- It won't hurt us to try.
- He's drowned.

160
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,611
You got no right to say that, do you hear me?

161
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,113
Maybe Spilett's seen
something from the rocks.

162
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:26,993
Oysters, gentlemen?

163
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:29,871
How come you're not looking
for the Captain, Mr. Spilett?

164
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:32,040
Because I'm looking for food instead.

165
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,959
Boy, did you ever see
oysters that size before?

166
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:38,004
- It's almost supernatural, isn't it?
- Look at him.

167
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:41,090
He's interested in food while
the Captain is still missing.

168
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,886
Take it easy, Neb. You won't
find him. Not alive, anyway.

169
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,263
I tell you he's drowned.

170
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,315
All right, Sergeant. Help yourself.

171
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,651
There. Get your health back.

172
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,112
- What, just raw like that?
- Sure. Why not?

173
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,530
No, thanks.

174
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,159
Come on, boy. Eat up! Come on!

175
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,912
Hey! Smoke!

176
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,383
Come on.

177
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:40,650
Captain Harding!

178
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,827
- Hey, Captain, are you all right?
- Yeah.

179
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:54,580
I knew you were alive,
Captain. Hey, didn't I tell you?

180
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,374
Didn't I tell you?

181
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:02,338
Neb, Herbert, you're all safe. Good.

182
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,049
Good morning, Captain. We missed you.

183
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,096
We would have found you sooner, Captain,
if you hadn't hidden out in these rocks.

184
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:14,016
- Didn't you bring me here?
- No, sir. We saw your fire.

185
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:20,022
I wasn't capable of lighting a
fire even if I'd had any matches.

186
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,108
And I hadn't.

187
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,444
None of us had, either.

188
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:27,113
I don't remember anything since I went under.

189
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,325
Obviously. Neb, he needs some hot food.

190
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,746
Bring some of those coals, and
I'll cook up a giant oyster stew.

191
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:41,043
Where do you think this fire came
from if the Captain didn't light it?

192
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,296
Of course he lit it somehow.

193
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:46,174
He just doesn't remember, that's all.

194
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,393
One giant oyster stew special, coming up.

195
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:01,981
- It smells good.
- It is, son.

196
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:04,567
Don't touch that, Captain.
It's the seasoning.

197
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,777
- What is it?
- Seaweed.

198
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:10,323
Captain, any idea where we are?

199
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:12,033
No.

200
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,161
That wind must have taken
us thousands of miles.

201
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:19,081
- Fiji, maybe.
- Or New Zealand. Anywhere.

202
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:24,212
Anywhere? On the other hand,
could be nowhere. Eh, Captain?

203
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,221
Gentlemen, we're going to climb that.

204
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,309
What for, Captain, the exercise?

205
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,770
No, for survival, Mr. Spilett.

206
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:44,732
From up there, we might be able to
see where we are and how to escape.

207
00:24:45,107 --> 00:24:47,235
Escape to where this time?

208
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:53,783
And on the way, we'll hunt and
forage. We need meat and vegetables.

209
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,327
And how will we kill the game?

210
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,955
You threw our only guns away.

211
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:01,290
- Herbert?
- Yes, sir?

212
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,586
- Have you still got your knife?
- Yes, sir.

213
00:25:06,754 --> 00:25:09,257
Good. Then you and Neb will be spear-makers.

214
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,718
Pencroft, you'll be the vegetable-finder.

215
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:15,429
I'm in the Confederate Army, not yours.

216
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:19,433
The arrangement was, once we landed,
I stopped being your prisoner.

217
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,936
The agreement was we'd go our own ways.

218
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:26,607
Either you come my way, under my
command, or you can fend for yourself.

219
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:30,111
All right.

220
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:32,863
- I'll find vegetables.
- Good.

221
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:38,786
And don't try and eat any of the food
you find until our cook has tasted it.

222
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:42,206
And who is ''our cook''?

223
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:44,542
You are.

224
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:48,504
I'm a civilian.

225
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:52,008
I don't have to take orders from
you, whatever army you're in.

226
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,803
That's legally correct, Mr. Spilett,
but I was under the impression...

227
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,888
...that you'd joined my command.

228
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,683
Joined? I was drafted.

229
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:05,980
Captain, why don't we turn this island
into a democracy and elect a leader?

230
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:10,067
One who won't keep escaping to
places which need escaping from.

231
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,406
Because all of us here are still at war,
and I happen to be the ranking officer.

232
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,701
Still at war! All right, I'll cook.

233
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:23,164
I thought you would, Mr. Spilett.

234
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:25,416
I'm the butcher man. I'll keep you busy.

235
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,752
Hey, take it easy.

236
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,424
<i>The landscape everywhere was a mixture
of the strange and the beautiful.</i>

237
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:37,470
<i>Volcanoes surrounded by
tropical palms and sandy beaches.</i>

238
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:41,140
<i>A riot of wonderful hues
and fantastic colours.</i>

239
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:45,186
<i>And except for that fire
we found on the first day...</i>

240
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:49,523
<i>...there was no evidence that
man had ever set foot here before.</i>

241
00:26:58,032 --> 00:27:03,662
<i>We saw birds, and many overgrown plants,
as if patches of nature had gone wild.</i>

242
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:12,296
<i>Ýt was a rugged trek upwards.</i>

243
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:15,299
<i>Our physical condition
caused us to tire readily...</i>

244
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:17,593
<i>...and we were never sure of our footing.</i>

245
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:14,316
<i>Then finally we came to the
shore of what must have been...</i>

246
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,277
<i>...the other side of the island.</i>

247
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:35,296
So help me, whales.

248
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:41,927
Those aren't whales. They're geysers.

249
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:48,308
Now we know where we can get a hot bath.

250
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:52,604
All right, gentlemen, we'll
make this our rendezvous.

251
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:56,567
Now, Mr. Spilett, I'll take Neb.
You take Pencroft and Herbert.

252
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:58,235
Take them where, Captain?

253
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:00,404
To hunt for food.

254
00:29:00,696 --> 00:29:01,905
Neb.

255
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,537
The animals will wait. Let's take a swim.

256
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:11,373
Come on, Pencroft.

257
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:47,451
Help me! Help me!

258
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,920
Get down here!

259
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,633
You almost got him.

260
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:15,604
Don't let him get away!
Pencroft, the rope. Come on!

261
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:25,447
Come on!

262
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,787
Pull it!

263
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,039
I'll get him.

264
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:43,382
Here, get hold of this.

265
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:58,272
Don't let him get away!

266
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:16,248
Hang on, Pencroft!

267
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,583
Try and turn it over on its back.

268
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:40,272
Look after him, Spilett!
Try and get it over the edge!

269
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:44,151
Heave!

270
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:04,755
That's the best crab I ever cooked.

271
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:09,676
We'd be more impressed, Mr. Spilett,
if you'd put it in the pot by yourself.

272
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:21,188
Dance!

273
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:28,236
Scoot in there. That a boy.

274
00:32:40,582 --> 00:32:42,292
That's a mighty big crab.

275
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:46,046
Captain, how do you suppose
it ever got that big?

276
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:49,674
- I'd like to know myself.
- From eating the giant oysters obviously.

277
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:53,303
- I guess I didn't help you much with it.
- You did all right, son.

278
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:55,305
No, I was scared.

279
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:58,183
It was the same with getting in the balloon.

280
00:32:58,266 --> 00:33:00,185
I couldn't move until I was shot at.

281
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:02,938
One shot, and my mind was made up, too.

282
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:05,982
You don't understand.

283
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:09,277
I ran away from a battle.
I've been running ever since.

284
00:33:10,237 --> 00:33:11,905
I got caught running away.

285
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:16,743
Son, your whole Union Army's
been running from mine...

286
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,495
...for the last three years.

287
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:22,499
Now we're running away from you.
You needn't feel special about it.

288
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:26,419
All right. We want to reach
that crater before nightfall.

289
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:38,616
Just once more around to the
top, Captain. Not too far.

290
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:40,535
Too far for me.

291
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:44,664
Oh, for the energy of youth.

292
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:48,376
Let's try a shortcut. Give me the rope.

293
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,879
You mean you're going to lasso that, Captain?

294
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:53,631
Mr. Harding, permit me.

295
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:57,010
With pleasure, Mr. Spilett.

296
00:35:01,848 --> 00:35:05,435
Don't you think you ought to stick
to newspaper writing, Mr. Spilett?

297
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,900
Hey!

298
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:16,071
I'm surprised you're so handy
with a rope, Mr. Spilett.

299
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:18,448
Now, you just watch a
good balloonist climb one.

300
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:22,035
You just watch a gentleman.

301
00:35:31,669 --> 00:35:33,421
Hey, he's doing it.

302
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:37,884
Good morning.

303
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:42,263
Look what we've got up here, giant mice.

304
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:46,643
There are some more.

305
00:35:48,561 --> 00:35:51,648
Come on, Spilett. We're going
to try and catch some goat.

306
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:54,734
Get up! Get up there!

307
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:23,346
We can build a corral
for these and keep them.

308
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:25,974
Yeah, there's nothing like
cheese made from goat milk.

309
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,143
- Would you like that, Captain?
- Very nice, Neb.

310
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:31,729
Hey, Captain, can you
see anything over there?

311
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:35,024
This is an island all right.
Nothing but water all around.

312
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:38,319
Hardly more than a volcano
pushed its way up out of the sea.

313
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,612
Harding!

314
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:41,447
- Harding!
- What?

315
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:45,410
Look out there. It's a small boat.

316
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:47,287
It must be.

317
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:51,541
- It seems to be only drifting.
- Maybe we could use it to get away.

318
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:10,101
She's beautiful.

319
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:12,854
Better than that, she's alive.

320
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:28,536
- How about this one, Captain?
- Yeah, she's alive, too.

321
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:39,255
Well, here's one that isn't.

322
00:37:55,146 --> 00:37:56,147
Thank you.

323
00:38:00,318 --> 00:38:01,486
I'm sorry.

324
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:02,862
Thank you.

325
00:38:08,409 --> 00:38:10,411
Will you have some of my soup, madam?

326
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:12,288
No, thank you.

327
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:14,707
Are you English?

328
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:18,628
No, ma'am. We're not
English. We're Americans.

329
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:21,047
It's made of shellfish.

330
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:23,716
A kind of French bouillabaisse.

331
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:26,094
There's only one kind of bouillabaisse.

332
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:29,263
- Auntie, you must have something.
- Leave me alone, child.

333
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,808
- Are you in charge?
- Yes, ma'am.

334
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,061
I take it that we're not in Marseilles...

335
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:37,772
...in spite of what the
gentleman offered us to eat.

336
00:38:37,855 --> 00:38:41,275
No, ma'am. We're somewhere in the Pacific.

337
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:43,778
On an island, to be exact.

338
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,450
But surely you weren't on our ship.

339
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:51,577
We came by balloon.

340
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:54,080
I beg your pardon?

341
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:55,790
I said, we came by-

342
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:59,001
Please don't talk nonsense.
I shall address myself to you.

343
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:00,753
But he's right, ma'am.

344
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:05,341
We were held in a Confederate prison and
escaped in one of their observation balloons.

345
00:39:05,424 --> 00:39:06,884
Yes, I'm quite sure of it.

346
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:10,346
But we can't possibly stay
here. How soon may we leave?

347
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:15,768
I'm not quite sure, ma'am.

348
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,773
My name is Lady Mary Fairchild.

349
00:39:20,982 --> 00:39:22,567
And this is my niece, Elena.

350
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:27,446
Ma'am. My name is Cyrus Harding. Captain
in the United States Army Engineers.

351
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,699
I take it you've met these others.

352
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:36,455
But where's the sailor who was on our boat?

353
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:39,917
I'm sorry to have to tell
you, ma'am, that he's dead.

354
00:39:42,128 --> 00:39:43,504
I see now.

355
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:48,467
Then how soon do you propose to leave?

356
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:50,595
Just as soon as we build a boat.

357
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:52,930
I hope it will be soon.

358
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,183
We were travelling home from Valparaiso.

359
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,687
My brother, who is Elena's
father, is British consul in Chile.

360
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:03,858
He didn't want her to make this voyage,
but I promised him she would be safe.

361
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:09,655
- How are you, my dear?
- I'm much better, thank you, Auntie.

362
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:12,241
But I think we're both a
little tired, don't you?

363
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:14,744
Yes, of course.

364
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:17,538
So if you will excuse us, gentlemen.

365
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,543
All right, gentlemen.

366
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,512
Gentlemen...

367
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:35,931
...we'll sleep out here.

368
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:39,685
Each of us will take a two-hour
watch on guard. I'll stand first.

369
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:41,479
- Neb, you next.
- Yes, sir.

370
00:40:41,646 --> 00:40:45,816
Tomorrow we'll find timber for the boat.
One of us will stay here with the women.

371
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:47,318
I'll stay.

372
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:49,487
I thought you'd volunteer for that.

373
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:52,031
- Neb, you'll stay.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:38,494
This is magnificent country.

375
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:41,747
A man could write an inspired
novel in a place like this.

376
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:45,709
Looks like a good stand of timber up there.

377
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:48,754
Supply of fresh water down here.

378
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,840
Pencroft, fill the cask.

379
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:52,383
Now look, I'm not...

380
00:41:54,385 --> 00:41:55,386
Yes, sir.

381
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:02,768
Maybe we ought to move over to this
side of the island permanently, Captain.

382
00:42:05,771 --> 00:42:07,648
You read my mind, Herbert.

383
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:11,277
I think we ought to take a look
down here on the beach first...

384
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:15,322
...to see if there's a good place
where we can build and launch the boat.

385
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:30,087
How do you expect to cut down
trees this size with a stone axe?

386
00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:33,299
By putting our backs into it, Mr. Spilett.

387
00:42:55,196 --> 00:42:57,156
What a spooky place this is.

388
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:59,241
Looks like someone hung down ropes.

389
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:00,910
No, those are vine creepers.

390
00:43:01,202 --> 00:43:04,288
They might have been hung
there all the same, to climb up.

391
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:08,250
- Who'd want to climb up there?
- Who saved the Captain? Who built his fire?

392
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:12,046
- Maybe it grew there naturally.
- Vines don't grow out of solid rock.

393
00:43:12,212 --> 00:43:14,632
Feels strong enough to take a man's weight.

394
00:43:15,132 --> 00:43:17,301
Now, you stay down here. I'll take a look.

395
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:11,058
''And so I have decided that a life
such as this is no longer worth living.

396
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:16,480
''I therefore bequeath all my
worldly possessions to whosoever...

397
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:18,565
''...shall discover my remains.

398
00:46:19,107 --> 00:46:23,153
''A curse upon the brigands who have
abandoned me to suffer and to die.''

399
00:46:24,112 --> 00:46:29,493
Signed, ''Thomas Ayrton. August 13, 1862.''

400
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:33,956
I'd trade all his worldly
possessions for one good axe.

401
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:36,917
I wonder why he never drank this up.

402
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,961
Probably was a teetotaller.

403
00:46:39,252 --> 00:46:41,546
It tastes... It smells mighty good.

404
00:46:41,672 --> 00:46:43,757
If you're looking for a story to write...

405
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,718
...there's a great one in that
diary for you, Mr. Spilett.

406
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:49,554
You know, Herbert, you're right.

407
00:46:51,223 --> 00:46:55,852
Thomas Ayrton, honest seaman, falls
in with a gang of cutthroat pirates...

408
00:46:56,186 --> 00:46:59,648
...and is cast away by them
on this mysterious island...

409
00:46:59,898 --> 00:47:03,193
...with his tongue cut out so
he won't reveal their secrets.

410
00:47:04,027 --> 00:47:06,655
Alone, he degenerates into animal savagery...

411
00:47:06,738 --> 00:47:09,282
...and finally, disgusted
with his bestiality...

412
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:11,576
...insane with hunger for the human company-

413
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,789
Just a minute now, Mr. Spilett.
Isn't all that just a little flowery?

414
00:47:15,956 --> 00:47:18,792
That's what the reading public wants today.

415
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:22,254
He hangs himself from the
rafters of a prehistoric cave.

416
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:25,257
The death of an ex-pirate.

417
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,884
''Yo-ho-ho, and
a bottle of rum!''

418
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:29,928
What's wrong with you?

419
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:32,097
Up the Jolly Roger!

420
00:47:32,347 --> 00:47:37,352
''Fifteen men on a dead man's chest''

421
00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:39,980
He's been swizzling this stuff.

422
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:43,400
This is our place, and everything in it.

423
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:46,737
Says so in his diary.

424
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,824
That's quite true, Pencroft.

425
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:53,660
This is ideal.

426
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:00,625
Perfect shelter, perfect safety.

427
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:05,505
And a fine place from which to carry
out our boat building operations.

428
00:48:05,714 --> 00:48:08,967
And, if I may say so, gentlemen...

429
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:12,554
...solid as a rock.

430
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:19,060
<i>We called our new place
''The Granite House.''</i>

431
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:22,230
<i>And our proudest achievement
was the construction...</i>

432
00:48:22,397 --> 00:48:25,358
<i>...of a homemade elevator.
A real engineering feat.</i>

433
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:30,572
<i>Ýt made it easier for us to bring
in whatever provisions we could find.</i>

434
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,117
<i>We attempted to equip the place
with as many modern conveniences...</i>

435
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:35,577
<i>...as we knew how.</i>

436
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:45,504
<i>The women added a few
welcomed, feminine touches...</i>

437
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,631
<i>...which turned the cave into a home...</i>

438
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:50,425
<i>...while we went off to
attend to the other work.</i>

439
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:55,847
<i>There was timber to cut, and
the boat which had to be built.</i>

440
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,475
<i>None of it was easy.</i>

441
00:48:59,017 --> 00:49:02,229
<i>We lived like primitive men,
using primitive implements.</i>

442
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:05,941
<i>But ingenuity and hard work
were our most valuable tools...</i>

443
00:49:06,107 --> 00:49:07,776
<i>...in our struggle to survive.</i>

444
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:15,325
<i>One tree down, but it took us days.</i>

445
00:49:16,284 --> 00:49:19,663
<i>And whatever we did accomplish,
we still lacked many things...</i>

446
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:21,831
<i>...that would make life bearable.</i>

447
00:49:22,165 --> 00:49:27,170
<i>And then, one afternoon, Neb found
something at the water's edge.</i>

448
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,011
Captain, these knots
are tied sailor-fashion.

449
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:37,430
Hey!

450
00:49:37,597 --> 00:49:40,141
- Look at that!
- Captain, rifles!

451
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,894
Breach loaders and ammunition!

452
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,522
Hey, Captain, what's in this box?

453
00:49:46,273 --> 00:49:48,358
It's a compass, charts...

454
00:49:50,026 --> 00:49:53,530
...and a sextant! We'll be
able to find out where we are.

455
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,157
There are hammers, saws, nails.

456
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:59,035
Hey, ladies, look at this.
Plenty of pots and pans.

457
00:50:00,161 --> 00:50:03,540
Also a looking glass. And hairpins.

458
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,419
Hey, a telescope! Man, there's
nothing this chest ain't got.

459
00:50:07,544 --> 00:50:10,088
Whoever packed this
certainly knew what we needed.

460
00:50:10,255 --> 00:50:12,799
And exactly what we ought to read.

461
00:50:14,884 --> 00:50:17,721
<i>''The Life and Adventures
of Robinson Crusoe.''</i>

462
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:26,980
Sorry.

463
00:50:27,063 --> 00:50:29,441
It's mighty nice of you
to do this for me, Elena.

464
00:50:29,524 --> 00:50:32,193
I intend to do it for all
of you. It's part of my job.

465
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:33,862
Captain Harding's order.

466
00:50:35,864 --> 00:50:37,115
Front, please.

467
00:50:41,536 --> 00:50:42,787
Mr. Spilett...

468
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:47,083
Thank you.

469
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,336
A few of the comforts of
civilization make life quite bearable.

470
00:50:50,462 --> 00:50:53,298
That depends on how many
comforts one's been used to.

471
00:50:53,381 --> 00:50:55,925
I'd say you'd never done
yourself badly, ma'am.

472
00:50:56,134 --> 00:50:58,428
Why should I? But don't let that mislead you.

473
00:50:58,595 --> 00:51:02,891
I'm the best shot in the county, and I
think I could outride you at any time.

474
00:51:03,057 --> 00:51:05,518
Probably outdrink you as well.

475
00:51:05,602 --> 00:51:08,730
That's something we must put to
the test at a later date, ma'am.

476
00:51:08,813 --> 00:51:11,316
At the moment, my main
comfort is your presence.

477
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:14,402
I'm not in much of a hurry
to leave this island now.

478
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:16,863
Well, I'm delighted to
have met you, Mr. Spilett.

479
00:51:16,988 --> 00:51:20,241
I'd be even more delighted
if I knew where we were.

480
00:51:20,825 --> 00:51:25,663
- Have you finished your calculations?
- Yes, ma'am. We're here.

481
00:51:26,247 --> 00:51:29,125
36 degrees south, 153 degrees west.

482
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:31,211
How interesting.

483
00:51:31,794 --> 00:51:35,465
Now I shall be able to say to my
friends, ''Do you know Mr. Spilett?

484
00:51:35,632 --> 00:51:39,469
''We ran into each other 36
degrees south, 150 degrees west.''

485
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:42,805
So much more intriguing
than the usual places.

486
00:51:43,806 --> 00:51:46,976
And of course, this large
body of land is New Zealand.

487
00:51:47,268 --> 00:51:50,396
New Zealand! How convenient.

488
00:51:50,522 --> 00:51:54,025
I have a cousin twice removed, he
serves in the Colonial Office there.

489
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:55,360
Really?

490
00:51:55,443 --> 00:51:59,030
In that case, ma'am, you'll be
delighted to know that you're only...

491
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:03,117
...one thousand eight hundred and...

492
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:07,288
...seventy-three miles away from him.

493
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:13,253
You work too hard, Captain.
Harder than any of us.

494
00:52:14,671 --> 00:52:16,714
Don't you ever think of anything else?

495
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:21,052
I will, ma'am, as soon
as we get off this island.

496
00:52:22,345 --> 00:52:26,808
Lady Mary, do you think that sea chest
could have come from your shipwreck?

497
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:30,561
I don't think so. Nobody had
any time to pack anything.

498
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:34,649
Captain, you seen this lettering?

499
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:40,571
''N-A-U...''

500
00:52:42,448 --> 00:52:43,283
<i>Nautilus!</i>

501
00:52:43,783 --> 00:52:45,535
Here, let me see that.

502
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:51,749
<i>You're right. It must be from the Nautilus.</i>

503
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,295
- You mean the submarine?
- Captain Nemo's ship.

504
00:52:55,712 --> 00:52:57,171
What a story that was.

505
00:52:57,297 --> 00:52:59,841
- Do you remember, Lady Mary?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

506
00:52:59,924 --> 00:53:02,093
Possibly it was during the hunting season.

507
00:53:02,427 --> 00:53:05,179
It made the headlines in New
York and London for weeks.

508
00:53:05,305 --> 00:53:07,682
This Nemo, with his...

509
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:10,601
...''submarine,'' did you call it?

510
00:53:11,978 --> 00:53:14,272
Was he a man of some notoriety?

511
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:16,649
He was a monster, a devil.

512
00:53:16,774 --> 00:53:19,318
What do you mean, he was
a devil? He was a genius.

513
00:53:19,444 --> 00:53:21,779
Any man who could live
under water like a fish-

514
00:53:21,863 --> 00:53:24,282
- Under what?
- Under water, ma'am.

515
00:53:24,365 --> 00:53:28,119
This submarine was powered with some
incredible method he'd invented himself.

516
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:30,747
Nothing on the surface could escape from it.

517
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:32,665
Precisely, Mr. Spilett.

518
00:53:32,832 --> 00:53:35,293
And he used it to destroy
ships without warning.

519
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,503
Only warships, Captain.

520
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,425
He had a kink about war, Lady Mary.
A very sensible kink. He hated it.

521
00:53:43,676 --> 00:53:46,846
Captain, what language is this?

522
00:53:50,141 --> 00:53:55,480
<i>It's Latin. ''Mihi libertas necessest.''</i>

523
00:53:56,856 --> 00:53:58,775
''I must have liberty.''

524
00:54:03,237 --> 00:54:05,156
Did he find it, Mr. Spilett?

525
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:08,493
His submarine was reported
lost off the coast of Mexico...

526
00:54:08,576 --> 00:54:11,245
...about eight years ago with all hands.

527
00:54:13,956 --> 00:54:17,585
This chest has been floating
in the sea for eight years.

528
00:54:18,085 --> 00:54:20,463
Do you really believe it has, Captain?

529
00:54:51,452 --> 00:54:52,912
I'm tired.

530
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:55,915
At your age? Ridiculous!

531
00:54:56,582 --> 00:54:58,376
I'm tired of working.

532
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:01,921
What do you want, a servant? So do I.

533
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:04,465
If you find one, send her to me.

534
00:55:04,674 --> 00:55:06,592
The next you can keep for yourself.

535
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:09,971
But in the meantime, we'll
go on working like the others.

536
00:55:10,846 --> 00:55:14,183
Mr. Spilett thinks we've been
overworked, too. He's gone fishing.

537
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,601
He has?

538
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:21,274
We better hope that Captain
Harding doesn't find out.

539
00:55:55,808 --> 00:55:58,936
Mary, run! Run!

540
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:10,531
Help!

541
00:56:21,751 --> 00:56:23,127
Hey, Neb, hold it.

542
00:58:02,685 --> 00:58:04,228
Come on, Pencroft!

543
00:58:04,478 --> 00:58:07,940
- I'll get him.
- No, wait, not here! You'll hit Herbert.

544
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,703
Are you all right?

545
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:32,673
I wonder how many minutes it
would take to cook in a slow oven.

546
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,267
Boy, it cuts like butter.

547
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:45,686
It tastes delicious, too.

548
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:49,940
I guess yesterday this bird would have
said the same thing about you, Mr. Spilett.

549
00:58:52,276 --> 00:58:54,069
What's the matter?

550
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,782
It might not have swallowed you, Mr.
Spilett, but it sure enough ate rocks.

551
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:01,619
- That doesn't look like a rock.
- No, it isn't.

552
00:59:01,952 --> 00:59:03,329
That's a bullet.

553
00:59:04,288 --> 00:59:06,582
None of us fired a shot at the bird.

554
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,002
No, I tried but the gun jammed.

555
00:59:10,711 --> 00:59:12,629
This is what killed it, all the same.

556
00:59:12,713 --> 00:59:15,799
- We'd have heard a shot, wouldn't we?
- Not necessarily.

557
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:19,470
It might've happened when the
bird crashed through the fence.

558
00:59:19,595 --> 00:59:21,722
I might have figured it wasn't my knife.

559
00:59:21,805 --> 00:59:24,516
It didn't feel right, the
way the bird fell under me.

560
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:28,354
You risked your life for me,
Herbert, and I'll never forget that.

561
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,689
Yes, that's right, Herbert.

562
00:59:30,898 --> 00:59:34,443
Had it not been for you, Mr. Spilett
would still be on the inside...

563
00:59:34,568 --> 00:59:37,780
...cutting out, instead of on
the outside cutting in, huh?

564
00:59:40,115 --> 00:59:43,577
<i>Lady Mary turned out to be quite
handy with a needle and thread.</i>

565
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:46,914
<i>She was able to make goatskins
into clothing for the men...</i>

566
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:49,458
<i>...and fashioned a trim garment for Elena.</i>

567
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:55,506
I don't know how I let you talk me into it.
Everyone's going to say it's far too short.

568
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:59,426
- Herbert won't.
- I'm certain he won't.

569
01:00:01,053 --> 01:00:02,554
Come here.

570
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:06,433
I've decided to marry him.

571
01:00:07,434 --> 01:00:08,936
And what has he decided?

572
01:00:09,228 --> 01:00:12,856
Don't sound so surprised. My mother
was already married by my age.

573
01:00:13,148 --> 01:00:15,150
That was on the Continent.

574
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:19,321
But don't you realise that we
may never get off this island?

575
01:00:19,488 --> 01:00:21,156
Then you'll have time to wait.

576
01:00:21,281 --> 01:00:23,784
- But Herbert doesn't want to wait.
- Doesn't he?

577
01:00:24,118 --> 01:00:26,912
- And neither do I.
- I'm afraid you'll have to.

578
01:00:27,371 --> 01:00:29,623
Go off and tend to your goats.

579
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:55,858
I'm going to ask Captain Harding to marry us.

580
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,112
That'd be wonderful, if he were
only a minister, but he's not.

581
01:01:00,487 --> 01:01:04,116
He's a captain, and captains
can marry people at sea.

582
01:01:05,492 --> 01:01:07,786
He's a land captain, not a sea captain.

583
01:01:08,036 --> 01:01:10,038
Well, we're on land, aren't we?

584
01:01:17,713 --> 01:01:19,089
Herbert.

585
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:22,551
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

586
01:01:22,885 --> 01:01:24,595
It looks like honey.

587
01:01:28,515 --> 01:01:29,516
It is honey.

588
01:01:29,975 --> 01:01:32,060
Did you ever visit a beehive?

589
01:02:08,138 --> 01:02:09,389
It's a honeycomb.

590
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:13,018
- It can't be. It's too big.
- It can't be anything else.

591
01:02:13,644 --> 01:02:17,064
Let's go get some seashells, and
we'll take some back for the others.

592
01:02:54,935 --> 01:02:56,686
Come on!

593
01:03:02,025 --> 01:03:03,652
Get in the honeycomb!

594
01:03:44,943 --> 01:03:46,278
What's it doing?

595
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:48,113
I don't know.

596
01:04:01,334 --> 01:04:02,836
It's sealing us in.

597
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:17,893
- Hey, Captain. A sail!
- We're going to be saved!

598
01:04:18,768 --> 01:04:20,520
They're right. Look.

599
01:04:20,729 --> 01:04:22,981
Captain, shall we light the signal fires now?

600
01:04:23,106 --> 01:04:25,108
- Yeah, come on!
- Hold it!

601
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,153
We'll take a look at it
through the telescope first.

602
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:31,031
What's the matter, don't
you want to be saved?

603
01:04:31,114 --> 01:04:34,117
It's coming this way,
whatever we do. Let's go!

604
01:04:35,201 --> 01:04:37,203
Come on, get up to Granite House.

605
01:04:51,217 --> 01:04:52,385
Hand me some more.

606
01:04:52,677 --> 01:04:53,637
What for?

607
01:04:55,555 --> 01:04:58,016
From the sea chest,
remember? I took these out.

608
01:05:33,927 --> 01:05:35,720
It's heavily armed.

609
01:05:38,223 --> 01:05:40,517
And it's flying the skull and crossbones.

610
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,853
Do you think it's the same pirates
Ayrton wrote about in his diary?

611
01:05:43,937 --> 01:05:47,023
It's the same ones who cut out
his tongue and left him to die.

612
01:05:47,107 --> 01:05:49,651
We wouldn't get much mercy
from them if they find us.

613
01:05:49,734 --> 01:05:52,070
You two get on the beach
and camouflage the boat.

614
01:05:52,153 --> 01:05:54,697
When you come back, get
this inside and out of sight.

615
01:05:54,823 --> 01:05:56,574
Spilett, stack the ammunition.

616
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:00,787
Elena's out there with
Herbert. We must get them back.

617
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:05,542
Don't worry. He's a soldier. If he sees a
gang of armed cutthroats, he'll take cover.

618
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:07,961
We're going to load and stack the rifles.

619
01:06:32,485 --> 01:06:33,486
Elena!

620
01:06:39,325 --> 01:06:40,702
Elena, are you all right?

621
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:47,876
What is it?

622
01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:50,503
It's some kind of ship.

623
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:53,882
I've never seen anything like it before.

624
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,009
Come on, let's get on it.

625
01:07:54,192 --> 01:07:55,401
Hello!

626
01:07:59,697 --> 01:08:01,407
Is anybody there?

627
01:08:04,243 --> 01:08:05,787
Come on.

628
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,341
Hello.

629
01:08:19,425 --> 01:08:20,677
Anybody there?

630
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:45,868
Let's take a look.

631
01:08:45,952 --> 01:08:47,995
- No, we'd better not.
- Come on.

632
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:53,543
<i>Herbert, didn't Mr. Spilett say the
Nautilus was sunk eight years ago...</i>

633
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:55,128
...off the coast of Mexico?

634
01:08:55,336 --> 01:08:56,754
Yeah, he did.

635
01:08:57,505 --> 01:08:59,132
Then what is it doing here?

636
01:08:59,799 --> 01:09:00,883
I don't know.

637
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:18,067
Herbert! Don't!

638
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:20,736
Let's get out of here.

639
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:57,315
How do we get out?

640
01:09:58,232 --> 01:09:59,650
Over there.

641
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:01,194
That wasn't there before.

642
01:10:01,319 --> 01:10:04,363
Maybe the tide came out or
something. Let's swim for it.

643
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:47,323
Neb.

644
01:10:51,744 --> 01:10:54,080
- How many are there?
- Only three.

645
01:11:04,548 --> 01:11:06,133
They're taking out casks.

646
01:11:07,927 --> 01:11:09,971
They must be going for water.

647
01:11:13,265 --> 01:11:14,684
We can take them, Captain.

648
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:17,853
And bring all the rest of
them ashore? No, thanks.

649
01:11:18,187 --> 01:11:20,147
We'll sit this one out quietly.

650
01:11:29,156 --> 01:11:32,576
- What are they doing now?
- They're going towards the boat.

651
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,371
- Do you think they'll find it?
- I don't know.

652
01:11:45,172 --> 01:11:47,049
Lady Mary, another rifle.

653
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:48,509
Yes, sir.

654
01:13:42,456 --> 01:13:45,542
Hey, Captain, look! It's sinking.

655
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:48,504
- What do you suppose happened?
- I don't know.

656
01:13:48,712 --> 01:13:50,714
Something must have blown up on her.

657
01:13:57,429 --> 01:13:59,348
Come on! We better get back fast.

658
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:27,209
Run, Elena.

659
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:51,692
Put that down.

660
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:56,905
All right, we'll split up.

661
01:14:57,114 --> 01:15:00,534
Spilett, you take the west
side. Neb, you go inland.

662
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,041
Very well, soldier.

663
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:12,212
Hang on to it if it gives you
comfort. Just don't throw it.

664
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:26,560
How do you do, Captain Harding?

665
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:28,645
I am Captain Nemo.

666
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,731
Nemo?

667
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:34,485
How did you know my name? Did you tell him?

668
01:15:34,651 --> 01:15:36,487
It wasn't necessary.

669
01:15:36,945 --> 01:15:41,658
I've known about you all for months,
now, from the day I carried you ashore.

670
01:15:41,992 --> 01:15:44,119
You were the one who built the fire?

671
01:15:45,412 --> 01:15:49,082
- The man who fired the mystery bullet.
- Someone had to kill that bird.

672
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:51,960
Her Ladyship's gun jammed.

673
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:55,464
Do join us, Lady Mary. I'm
not quite the ogre I appear.

674
01:15:55,798 --> 01:15:59,301
Do you usually dress up like
that to frighten young ladies?

675
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:03,430
No, not to frighten young
ladies. To breathe under water.

676
01:16:04,097 --> 01:16:06,558
You see, I do much of my work out there.

677
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,268
So we've heard.

678
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,355
Like sinking ships and drowning innocent men.

679
01:16:11,688 --> 01:16:15,901
Surely you don't object to my
having placed an explosive charge...

680
01:16:16,068 --> 01:16:18,403
...to that pirate ship to drown them, do you?

681
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:21,406
See, Harding, I told you he
was a genius and not a devil.

682
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:23,659
<i>Captain Nemo, I'm from the New York Herald.</i>

683
01:16:23,742 --> 01:16:26,411
- I reported your story eight
years ago- -I know you.

684
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:31,291
I've read some of your dispatches.
You specialise in war news, don't you?

685
01:16:31,542 --> 01:16:35,170
You supply the ink. The
soldiers supply the blood.

686
01:16:35,837 --> 01:16:39,341
- I bet that was his place we just came from.
- Yes.

687
01:16:39,883 --> 01:16:43,804
There's a big iron ship in a flooded
grotto. Elena and I were just aboard.

688
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:47,099
<i>- The Nautilus? Here?
- What's left of it.</i>

689
01:16:47,307 --> 01:16:50,185
- That means we can get
off- -No, you can't.

690
01:16:50,269 --> 01:16:55,065
If you hope to use my vessel to leave, don't,
because she can never take to sea again.

691
01:16:55,232 --> 01:16:57,693
Why have you stayed hidden
from us all this time?

692
01:17:00,904 --> 01:17:04,992
Because contact with my own
species has always disappointed me.

693
01:17:05,784 --> 01:17:11,290
Solitude gives me freedom of
mind and independence of action.

694
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,794
Why have you picked this particular
time to interrupt this solitude?

695
01:17:16,712 --> 01:17:18,255
I'll tell you.

696
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,467
Because your behaviour,
gentlemen, and ladies...

697
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:25,470
...in a struggle for survival,
has been quite admirable.

698
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:29,391
Now I am satisfied that I
can use your resourcefulness.

699
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:34,271
You see, that volcano is
on the verge of eruption.

700
01:17:40,694 --> 01:17:44,531
A catastrophe of nature will soon
turn this island into cinders.

701
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:48,201
In short, Captain Harding,
I need your help...

702
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,370
...as much as you need mine.

703
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:53,498
Only you don't have much
choice if you want to live.

704
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:58,086
Now you listen to me. We won't do
anything because of your threats.

705
01:17:58,253 --> 01:18:00,630
We have every intention of going on living.

706
01:18:00,964 --> 01:18:03,884
If, however, you'd care to
share the boat we're building...

707
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:05,927
...I think that might be arranged.

708
01:18:06,094 --> 01:18:09,181
Thank you, but it wouldn't
be finished in time.

709
01:18:09,556 --> 01:18:13,477
Also, it would be too small for my needs.

710
01:18:14,144 --> 01:18:19,024
Fortunately, the ship that will carry us
all into safety is already waiting for us.

711
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:21,735
Out there.

712
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:47,385
My last bottle.

713
01:18:48,178 --> 01:18:51,181
Another pressing reason for moving out soon.

714
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:56,478
Captain Nemo, if we ever do get off this
island, I'd like to write your life story.

715
01:18:56,603 --> 01:19:01,733
Yes. Whatever does a man do on an
island like this for eight years?

716
01:19:02,526 --> 01:19:06,029
It depends on the man. I
did what I've always done...

717
01:19:06,696 --> 01:19:10,158
...devoted my strength to
destroying the concept of warfare.

718
01:19:11,034 --> 01:19:13,286
Your profession, Captain Harding.

719
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:19,501
Considering the ships and crews
that you've sunk without mercy...

720
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,003
...you can't disturb my conscience.

721
01:19:22,712 --> 01:19:24,047
Can't I?

722
01:19:24,548 --> 01:19:26,716
What I did was in the name of peace.

723
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:33,181
Your war, like all wars,
glories in devastation and death.

724
01:19:34,266 --> 01:19:36,601
Well, my war will set men free.

725
01:19:37,394 --> 01:19:40,313
That's a struggle that belongs
to all men, don't you think?

726
01:19:40,397 --> 01:19:43,650
Just how have you been able to
carry out your crusade, Captain...

727
01:19:43,733 --> 01:19:46,820
<i>...without the Nautilus in operation?</i>

728
01:19:47,237 --> 01:19:50,574
A good question, Mr. War Correspondent.

729
01:19:51,032 --> 01:19:55,287
It will please Captain Harding to know
it did not entail the sinking of warships.

730
01:19:56,329 --> 01:20:01,084
So instead, I've been conducting
experiments in horticultural physics.

731
01:20:01,209 --> 01:20:02,627
Horti-what?

732
01:20:02,752 --> 01:20:07,882
Experiments that will guarantee
mankind an inexhaustible food supply.

733
01:20:09,217 --> 01:20:12,178
Yes. Surely you've seen the results.

734
01:20:12,429 --> 01:20:14,973
- Hey, that crab!
- And the honeycomb!

735
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:20,520
The giant oysters you devoured.
The bird that almost devoured you.

736
01:20:21,896 --> 01:20:25,525
<i>With the Nautilus, I was merely
attacking the weapons of war.</i>

737
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:31,531
But now I've conquered the causes:
famine and economic competition.

738
01:20:33,325 --> 01:20:38,705
Imagine, wheat growing 40 feet
high and sheep the size of cattle.

739
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:43,710
When I've delivered my designs
and apparatus to the world...

740
01:20:45,462 --> 01:20:47,255
...my work will be over.

741
01:20:47,339 --> 01:20:50,759
That's what you meant when you said
our boat wouldn't be big enough.

742
01:20:50,842 --> 01:20:52,844
- That is right.
- Now look.

743
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:56,097
You said that volcano was due
to erupt in the next few days.

744
01:20:56,598 --> 01:20:58,600
Have we got time to just sit and talk?

745
01:20:59,517 --> 01:21:03,438
Not really, but I should
like to if you don't mind.

746
01:21:03,772 --> 01:21:07,400
I want to make it clear to you that
there is more than saving our lives...

747
01:21:07,484 --> 01:21:08,985
...which interests me.

748
01:21:09,069 --> 01:21:12,739
I must take the results of
my work back to civilization.

749
01:21:12,989 --> 01:21:17,994
To do this, I realised I needed a
ship of size, like that pirate vessel.

750
01:21:18,244 --> 01:21:20,497
And that's why you sent her to the bottom?

751
01:21:21,164 --> 01:21:24,793
How would you dispose of a crew
of violent men in one stroke?

752
01:21:24,876 --> 01:21:28,129
Do you actually believe you
can refloat a ship of that size?

753
01:21:29,255 --> 01:21:32,842
I planted that charge to damage
her only in one small section.

754
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,471
I have the necessary equipment to raise her.

755
01:21:37,013 --> 01:21:40,600
And you all will supply the manpower.

756
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:45,438
To your very good health. You will need it.

757
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,693
Now, Captain Harding...

758
01:21:51,653 --> 01:21:55,198
...aren't you ready to
dance with the devil now?

759
01:21:57,283 --> 01:22:00,620
You show me the pumps and the
power to raise that ship...

760
01:22:01,204 --> 01:22:04,040
...and then you'll have
seven new waltz partners.

761
01:22:07,919 --> 01:22:09,295
Very well.

762
01:22:12,215 --> 01:22:13,258
Have a look.

763
01:22:31,234 --> 01:22:36,364
This bottle, like a ship, floats
because it is filled with air.

764
01:22:37,448 --> 01:22:41,119
Now, make a hole in either, as
I did in that pirate vessel...

765
01:22:41,786 --> 01:22:43,871
...the air is displaced by water...

766
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:49,085
...and the bottle, like the
ship, sinks to the bottom.

767
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:57,677
Therefore, when we've set a patch
over the damaged section of the hull...

768
01:22:58,469 --> 01:23:00,263
...we can pipe air into it...

769
01:23:00,972 --> 01:23:05,018
...through the pipeline,
which we construct from bamboo.

770
01:23:05,518 --> 01:23:09,230
The pressurised air entering here
drives the water out of the hold...

771
01:23:09,314 --> 01:23:13,985
...which becomes afloat, and as it does
so, the ship will rise to the surface.

772
01:23:14,193 --> 01:23:16,654
Fabricating the patch,
bolting it into place...

773
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:20,867
...making sure all sections of the hull
are airtight, including the hatchways...

774
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:23,578
...are the jobs you will
have to do under water.

775
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,289
I'll train you and equip you for it.

776
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:30,627
- Theoretically, it should work.
- Theoretically, we'll be dead if it doesn't.

777
01:23:32,337 --> 01:23:36,341
<i>Although Captain Nemo was
confident, Ý was extremely doubtful.</i>

778
01:23:37,383 --> 01:23:41,387
<i>Nevertheless, under his direction
we cut bamboo for the pipeline.</i>

779
01:23:42,305 --> 01:23:44,766
<i>Nemo told us where there were rubber trees...</i>

780
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:48,186
<i>...and the women gathered the
sap to seal the pipe connections.</i>

781
01:23:48,394 --> 01:23:51,272
<i>And we laboriously manufactured
a large wooden patch...</i>

782
01:23:51,481 --> 01:23:53,691
<i>...according to Nemo's specifications.</i>

783
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:58,196
<i>We were to use it to repair the
hull of the damaged pirate ship.</i>

784
01:23:58,571 --> 01:24:01,699
<i>Even Spilett worked hard
on the raft we would need.</i>

785
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:06,079
<i>Lady Mary and Elena arduously
applied the sealing substance...</i>

786
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:08,164
<i>...joining the lengths of bamboo...</i>

787
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:11,417
<i>...which had to be stretched
from the Nautilus' engine room...</i>

788
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:15,630
<i>...through tortuous rocky areas
to the water's edge and beyond.</i>

789
01:24:18,049 --> 01:24:21,719
<i>Then Nemo gave us underwater gear
that he kept aboard his submarine.</i>

790
01:24:22,303 --> 01:24:26,349
<i>The breathing apparatus had been
fabricated out of giant seashells.</i>

791
01:24:26,432 --> 01:24:30,228
<i>We had to learn how to walk with lead
- weighted shoes on the seabed...</i>

792
01:24:30,436 --> 01:24:33,147
<i>...and to withstand the
pressures of the water's depth.</i>

793
01:24:40,488 --> 01:24:43,991
<i>Nemo then showed us the incredible
electric gun he had invented...</i>

794
01:24:44,075 --> 01:24:46,786
<i>...for protection against
the dangers of the deep.</i>

795
01:25:23,322 --> 01:25:25,867
<i>By learning to breathe
and walk on the seafloor...</i>

796
01:25:26,284 --> 01:25:30,329
<i>...Nemo showed us the remains of an
ancient city and a forgotten civilization.</i>

797
01:25:31,163 --> 01:25:34,250
<i>We could see that once before
a volcano had erupted...</i>

798
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:39,422
<i>...decreeing the death of all who are now
entombed in this weird, sunken citadel.</i>

799
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:43,778
Herbert, these aren't finished here.

800
01:26:45,905 --> 01:26:49,533
Well, we ought to be able to
fit the patch tomorrow morning.

801
01:27:17,144 --> 01:27:19,438
Is that it? Is it starting now?

802
01:27:26,153 --> 01:27:29,490
I was wrong. There won't be enough time.

803
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:32,535
Man, look at it. It's terrifying!

804
01:27:42,628 --> 01:27:44,713
We've lost the race.

805
01:27:45,881 --> 01:27:49,093
Still, there is always a
small chance it will subside.

806
01:27:50,261 --> 01:27:54,014
<i>I suggest we take cover
in the Nautilus and hope.</i>

807
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:23,169
When the lava comes, we'll
just be trapped here, won't we?

808
01:28:23,252 --> 01:28:25,171
How soon will that be?

809
01:28:26,797 --> 01:28:28,716
Would it really help to know?

810
01:28:29,633 --> 01:28:32,803
Two hours. Two hours, then.

811
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:51,614
Aren't we able to do
anything to save ourselves?

812
01:28:52,948 --> 01:28:54,825
There's nothing that can be done.

813
01:28:54,909 --> 01:28:58,746
Is this the infinitely resourceful
genius you told me about?

814
01:28:59,163 --> 01:29:03,208
A man who says let yourself be trapped
and die without even lifting a finger.

815
01:29:05,377 --> 01:29:09,798
I don't believe nothing can
be done. I don't believe it!

816
01:29:11,717 --> 01:29:13,135
Lady Mary...

817
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:16,180
...I am a realist.

818
01:29:20,517 --> 01:29:24,021
Captain Harding, is he right?

819
01:29:24,563 --> 01:29:27,942
Have we worked so hard and
gone through all this...

820
01:29:28,025 --> 01:29:29,818
...to be told there's no hope?

821
01:29:29,902 --> 01:29:33,030
He is like you, a man
of faith, not of reason.

822
01:29:39,536 --> 01:29:40,913
Captain.

823
01:29:41,664 --> 01:29:43,499
Captain, come here, please.

824
01:29:50,506 --> 01:29:51,757
I've got an idea.

825
01:30:03,769 --> 01:30:05,604
Herbert, now look.

826
01:30:06,063 --> 01:30:09,316
Say this is the envelope of the
balloon that brought us here.

827
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,860
It would only take about
half an hour to repair.

828
01:30:11,944 --> 01:30:14,279
We attach it to the bamboo pipeline.

829
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:18,409
Then we place it inside
the hull of the sunken ship.

830
01:30:18,826 --> 01:30:20,869
It would take, what, another hour.

831
01:30:20,953 --> 01:30:22,996
<i>Then with the pumps of the Nautilus...</i>

832
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:26,417
...we force air into the balloon
cloth, creating a huge air bubble...

833
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:30,546
...and floats to the surface bringing
the ship with it. It must work.

834
01:30:30,629 --> 01:30:35,175
Just possible, if the fabric
will hold the pressure.

835
01:30:35,259 --> 01:30:37,344
If there's a chance, we've got to try.

836
01:30:38,303 --> 01:30:40,222
By heaven, it is a chance.

837
01:30:41,765 --> 01:30:44,059
Captain Harding, get
the underwater equipment.

838
01:30:44,143 --> 01:30:46,520
And you'd better take the women with you.

839
01:30:46,812 --> 01:30:49,773
I'll stay to operate the pump
and to assemble my equipment.

840
01:30:49,857 --> 01:30:52,526
When this needle zeroes,
I'll know the ship is afloat.

841
01:30:52,609 --> 01:30:54,695
Right, we'll be back for you.

842
01:35:56,329 --> 01:35:57,497
Pencroft!

843
01:36:01,418 --> 01:36:04,879
Neb, signal Nemo, or none
of us will get out of here.

844
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:37,245
The air's coming through,
Captain. Can you hear it?

845
01:37:35,512 --> 01:37:37,972
She's up! We've done it, Captain!

846
01:37:41,809 --> 01:37:43,353
All right, come on.

847
01:37:43,436 --> 01:37:46,356
We've got to get the women on
board and get back for Nemo.

848
01:40:16,214 --> 01:40:21,010
<i>We deeply regretted we could not save
the life of the man who had saved ours.</i>

849
01:40:21,093 --> 01:40:24,931
<i>A man who dedicated himself
to ending strife among men.</i>

850
01:40:26,098 --> 01:40:29,852
<i>And when we returned to civilization,
we all pledged ourselves to working...</i>

851
01:40:29,936 --> 01:40:34,690
<i>...for a peaceful and bountiful
world, as Captain Nemo would have it.</i>

852
01:40:35,305 --> 01:40:41,314
