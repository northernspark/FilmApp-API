00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,232
Who are you?

3
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,279
Hello, I'm Nancy Drew.
It's nice to meet you.

4
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,509
May I ask who you are?

5
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,878
- Guess.
- All right.

6
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,474
I'm guessing you two are working
with Lawrence McNabb...

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,676
...the locksmith,
he gives you the keys...

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,149
...and you're responsible
for the recent burglaries.

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,118
However, you should know
the DA is only interested in McNabb...

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,838
You two could make a deal with him.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,629
...and that Charlie the security guard
is about to walk through that door.

12
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,599
Hi.

13
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,678
Listen to me. I'll get Pastor Murray
to drop the charges...

14
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,876
...if you agree to
some kind of counseling.

15
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,473
Anger issues don't just go away.

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,473
- I don't need a shrink.
- Yeah, you do.

17
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,278
He gets cranky when he hasn't eaten.

18
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,953
I told him, "Go have a snack."

19
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,237
I said, "Before we get here,
you better have a snack."

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,511
Oh, one summer,
we're on Fire Island...

21
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,352
Hey... Not with that story again.

22
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,798
Hold on.

23
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,189
What's that?

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,198
My sleuth kit.

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,753
Flashlight, fountain pen, notebook,
magnifying glass, fingerprint powder...

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,638
...digital recorder...

27
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,269
...and one of Hannah's lemon bars.

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,549
Bess,
is Nancy okay?

29
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,153
Are you kidding?
She's loving it.

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,550
- Here he is.
- Nancy?

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,709
Hi, Ned.

32
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,677
I had this dream
during my nap today...

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,354
...you went to California,
met that guy on Smallville...

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,316
...and you got amnesia...

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,438
...and forgot you ever met me,
and then I turned into a squirrel.

36
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,036
Anyway, what do you think that means?

37
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,557
Um, Ned, can we talk about
this later? I'm just a little busy.

38
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,597
Y eah, sorry.
All right, okay.

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,113
Not appropriate, Ned.

40
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,952
You take naps?

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,114
What's going on?
Is she okay?

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,078
Hey, now don't worry.
I just talked with her. She's doing fine.

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,509
Nancy's my best man.

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,517
I mean, she would be
if she were on the force.

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,674
Fine. Therapy.

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,434
Great.
I'll call the DA back. Ha.

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,712
I just wanna thank you, Nancy Drew.

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,996
I've always heard
the nicest things about you...

49
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,879
...the way you solve mysteries
and you help people.

50
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,395
Steve?
Please don't thank her for turning us in.

51
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,311
I think Crankenstein needs
another lemon bar.

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,951
I thought the Crankasaurus
was extinct.

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,599
I don't know about this.

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,877
Well, I'm sorry, Cranky Doodle Dandy.

55
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,189
I can't do this.

56
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,793
Gary, we made a deal.

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,632
Deals go wrong.

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,995
Hey. Where is she?
We need her.

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,912
You take that side.

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,159
Hey, Gary, look.

61
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,713
Hey!

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,790
Let's get out of here.

63
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,872
It's Nancy!

64
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,755
Hi, everybody.

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,558
Hold it there.
Hold it right there.

66
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,152
Hold on, Nancy.
We got the fire department here.

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,675
That's all right, chief.
I'll be down in a jiffy.

68
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,990
Hang on, Nancy.

69
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,109
Are you okay?

70
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,719
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

71
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,792
In the sleuthing business,
this kind of thing happens all the time.

72
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,552
It really isn't a big deal.

73
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,233
It is a big deal.

74
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,757
I ran from the courthouse in the middle
of that eviction case, which the judge...

75
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,230
...he didn't appreciate.

76
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,669
Where is your car?

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,151
Around the corner.

78
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,590
Is now a better time?

79
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,228
Because I wanted to give you this.

80
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,472
Well, your hunch was right
on the nose, Nancy.

81
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,632
Just wish you could have
clued us in a little earlier.

82
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,789
Safe as usual.

83
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,949
All right, Nancy, right here.

84
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,235
Hi, Nancy.

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,079
Thank you.
Bye.

86
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,117
Nancy, what are we going to do
without you?

87
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,191
It's only for a few months.
I'll be back.

88
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,432
The image of your mother.
Do you remember her at all?

89
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,669
No.

90
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,549
She was such a lovely woman,
so kind and intelligent.

91
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,233
Just like you, Nancy.

92
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,232
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye-bye.

93
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,231
So long, Nancy.

94
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,393
Shall we all pray
for her safe journey to California?

95
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,118
Sure.

96
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,158
Dear Lord,
please watch over Nancy Drew...

97
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,278
...and protect her as she strives
to solve mysteries...

98
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,752
...that are beyond the abilities
of local law enforcement agencies.

99
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,469
Dad, I'm...

100
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,915
I want you to promise,
no more sleuthing...

101
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,308
...at least while we're in California.

102
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,792
You'll go to school, shopping,
spend some time with teenagers.

103
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,952
It's what you're supposed to be doing.
Give it a try.

104
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,949
You know, I've always picked cases
that help people.

105
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,553
- Others first.
- That's right.

106
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,836
But this one is a little different.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,470
If everything goes well,
I could start making some real money.

108
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,755
We have enough money, Dad.

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,592
I'll be the judge of that, thank you.

110
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,594
At any rate, I'm starting something new.
I can't be worried about...

111
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,438
How you doing, John?

112
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,672
Yeah, I'll meet you at the deposition
as soon as my train gets in.

113
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,229
Well, we don't have
an airport out here.

114
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,674
I wish I was kidding.

115
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,078
This is a terrible development.

116
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,073
What are you gonna do?
You have a mystery to solve in la-la land.

117
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,435
I'll figure something out.

118
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,749
I hope.

119
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,679
Ned.

120
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,071
With all the commotion,
I didn't get to give you this.

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,910
I needed a new compass.
The old one's wobbly.

122
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,274
Thank you.

123
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,317
In case I'm not with you
on your birthday.

124
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,435
That's so sweet.

125
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,716
Ugh, I just don't know
if I'll get to use it.

126
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,309
Why?

127
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,758
My dad let me choose the house we're
gonna live in, so I chose one with...

128
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,478
With a mystery.

129
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,229
But not just any mystery. One of the
greatest unsolved cases of all time.

130
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,389
Dehlia Draycott.

131
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,637
The movie actress.

132
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,360
Before your time.
Twenty-five years ago...

133
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,516
...at the height of her fame,
she disappeared for five months.

134
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,716
Nobody knew where.

135
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,589
And when she came back,
she threw a giant party.

136
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,798
She never went downstairs
to greet her guests.

137
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,672
She was found floating in the pool.

138
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,875
Dead.

139
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,749
Gee, that sounds like fun.

140
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,395
I know, right?

141
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,391
But I didn't tell my dad
about the house...

142
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,437
...and now he's not letting me
do any sleuthing.

143
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,558
There was a hostage situation.
I can kind of see his point, but...

144
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,393
Hi, Ned. Bye, Ned.
Gotta scoot, Nancy.

145
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,155
Mr. Drew.
Some pfeffernüsse, just in case...

146
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,709
...and some ginger cupcakes,
your favorite.

147
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,711
You're gonna get hungry,
I know it.

148
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,438
Nancy, hold on.
Thank you so much.

149
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,989
Bye, guys.
See you soon.

150
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,199
And have a safe train ride, okay?

151
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,349
I'll miss you.

152
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,431
Don't get hurt.
Please, you have to keep in contact.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,436
Um, Ned? Don't worry
about that guy from Smallville.

154
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,272
- He's not my type.
- Nancy.

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,035
You have a type?

156
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,909
Chief McGinnis!
I just wanna let you know...

157
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,036
...that I'm not sleuthing anymore. Bye.

158
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,070
Nancy Drew not sleuthing anymore?
I don't think so. Ha, ha, ha.

159
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,270
Hi, this is Carson Drew.
I'm running a little late.

160
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,716
Dad? Don't you think people who talk
on cell phones, um, miss things?

161
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,235
- Like what, hon?
- Like that woman in the street?

162
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,074
Uh, Mr. Drew? Nancy?

163
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,429
Yes.

164
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,279
Hi. Thank you so much
for not running me over.

165
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm Barbara Barbara,
of Barbara Barbara Realty.

166
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,034
You're here.

167
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,395
I'm gonna get right out of your way.

168
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,119
How do you love it?

169
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,832
Uh, gorgeous.

170
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,912
Welcome.

171
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,639
It's not exactly what I had
in mind, especially given the price.

172
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,109
Well, as I told your daughter
on the phone...

173
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,838
...you do pay a premium for my...

174
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,434
Oh, I am such an oaf.

175
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,431
Um, as you were saying,
you pay a premium...

176
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,830
...for history,
architectural significance.

177
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,719
I mean, Dad, look at this woodwork.

178
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,757
Yeah, what she said.
Who's this?

179
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,797
Dehlia Draycott, the great film legend.
This was her home.

180
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,598
Didn't your daughter tell you?

181
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,036
We've both been somewhat busy.

182
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,430
Oh, excuse me. Gotta... Yeah.

183
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,874
Hello?

184
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,433
Do you know what? With a little
tweaking, you could be adorable.

185
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,830
Um, thank you?

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,958
Yes, you're just a makeover
waiting to happen.

187
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,076
I'm gonna give you
the name of my stylist.

188
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,437
Oh, come on, let's go upstairs.
I can't wait to show you.

189
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,638
Did you hear something?

190
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,751
I suddenly got a chill.

191
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,759
Have a look around, if you want.

192
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,432
Don't be afraid.

193
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,390
Please don't be afraid of me.

194
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,079
I'm here to help you.

195
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,713
You don't understand, I want to...
I want to help you.

196
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,679
I love that.
They fall for it every time.

197
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,118
That's a projector.
Oh, it's from one of her old movies.

198
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,470
There are so many booby traps
all over this house.

199
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,359
People get so scared sometimes,
they wet their pants.

200
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,751
Where's the gift shop?

201
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,912
That's the spirit.

202
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,390
Miss Barbara Barbara, I know I called
asking for a house with a mystery...

203
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
...but things have changed, and...

204
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,790
It's complicated,
but we're gonna need a different house.

205
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,715
Honey cheeks.
Read the fine print.

206
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,236
No refunds, no exchanges.

207
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,871
And besides, you know, there's nothing
else available, in your price range.

208
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,149
I'm gonna use the gents',
then run to that deposition.

209
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,398
Watch this.

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,638
Something just happened
in the bathroom...

211
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,155
...which I am at a loss to explain.

212
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,590
The house has a haunted theme.

213
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,792
It's like a theme park.
It's so fun, right, Dad?

214
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,389
No.

215
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,789
Oh, did I mention?
There's a strange caretaker.

216
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,678
He lives in an apartment down the hill.

217
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,359
What's your name?

218
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,830
Leshing. Let me know
if there's anything I can do for you.

219
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,752
Nancy Drew.
Thank you very much.

220
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,474
Leshy?
We need to talk about the lawn.

221
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,873
Dad?

222
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,677
Mr. Leshing?

223
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,552
Someone stole my moccasins
and an important folder.

224
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,915
Mysteries just find you, don't they?

225
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,718
I'm letting the professionals
handle this one.

226
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,394
I'm on hold with the L.A.P.D.

227
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,279
Calling the police to solve a crime.

228
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,759
I like it.

229
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,390
It's been 57 minutes.
They must be having a busy night.

230
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,595
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.
- I'm fine!

231
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,797
A favorite pair of moccasins
and a Pee Chee folder have been stolen.

232
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,757
Please send an officer over
immediately.

233
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,349
Someone must have told a joke
over at the precinct.

234
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,309
Yeah. That's it.

235
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,388
Because it would be irresponsible...

236
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,790
...for a police department
to laugh at a crime.

237
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,948
You're right.

238
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,233
Dad?

239
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,391
- Hello?
- Leshing, this is Nancy.

240
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,711
I needed to prove your whereabouts.
Go back to sleep.

241
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,157
Someone's in the house.

242
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,753
How did you get here so quickly?

243
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,998
If you're accusing me...

244
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,594
The attic.

245
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,949
How is it possible for someone
to be in the attic...

246
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,793
...and escape
while we're coming up the stairs?

247
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,109
Is there another staircase?

248
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,512
No.

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,672
Do you believe in ghosts, Mr. Leshing?

250
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,079
I am a ghost.

251
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,750
The Four Seasons isn't haunted.
What do you say?

252
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,151
Dad, you hate hotels.

253
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,111
Spa treatments.
Room service.

254
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,114
These books must have been Dehlia's.

255
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,949
May I borrow some?

256
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,831
If it were up to me, I wouldn't
let anybody in the house, period.

257
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,070
But you're paying the rent,
so do what you want.

258
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,468
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

259
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,119
Good night.

260
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,197
I like him.

261
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,230
So turns out there's a mystery
here after all.

262
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,916
Dad, that mystery stuff is so boring
to me now. I've completely moved on.

263
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,835
That was really just a phase, you know,
like papier-mâché or puppets.

264
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,673
It's over, done, finished, gone forever.

265
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,114
Got it.

266
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,676
Z, I'm sorry to have vanished like I did.

267
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,831
I know you have been looking for me.

268
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,275
Something important
happened last week.

269
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,831
I can't be the Dehlia I was anymore.
I'm writing a new will.

270
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,675
I need to make provisions
for someone else. D.

271
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,352
D is Dehlia, but who's Z?
Who's the "someone else"?

272
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,309
No.

273
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,799
You' re not sleuthing.
No, sirree.

274
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,758
You' re just reading a letter
that happens to be a major clue...

275
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,672
...in a fantastically famous mystery.

276
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,592
That means nothing to you.

277
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,830
You're gonna go to bed
and be reasonable, Nancy.

278
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,117
You're going to a new school.
You're gonna make wonderful friends.

279
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,556
You're a normal teenager.
You really are.

280
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,233
Yeah.

281
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,469
Yes.

282
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,755
The quadratic formula:

283
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,195
Negative-B plus or minus
the square root of B-squared...

284
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,193
...minus four A-C, all over two A.

285
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,270
I only had enough time
for 12 flying buttresses.

286
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,237
But in actuality, there are 26.

287
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,710
Then I'll be brief.
O happy dagger!

288
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,869
Thank you. Please.

289
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,191
This is thy sheath.
There rust, and let me die.

290
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,828
The show is Pippin.
And I just wanted your name.

291
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,116
Hey, baby. How you doing?

292
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,873
- Hi.
- Hello.

293
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,234
Hi, I noticed you were wearing
penny loafers.

294
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,551
Did your podiatrist suggest them
or are you being ironic?

295
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,073
I like old-fashioned things.

296
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,912
Oh, we've noticed.

297
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,917
Penny loafers are practical.

298
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,756
Well, we may be on the brink
of a penny loafer fashion moment...

299
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,159
...or not.

300
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,434
That was awesome.

301
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,479
- Give that cupcake back.
- Shut up.

302
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,032
Come on.

303
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,036
That's a good cupcake.

304
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,317
Principal Fineman, I feel strongly...

305
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,950
...students should be given a more
nutritious alternative in the cafeteria.

306
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,109
Perhaps a salad bar.

307
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,189
A salad bar. Terrific idea.

308
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,999
Hi. I think the principal
wants to yell at me or something?

309
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,230
Let's see. Oh, yes.

310
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,676
There may be lead paint in
the shed next to the volleyball courts...

311
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,878
...but I can't be certain until
the lab report comes back.

312
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,395
Lead paint.
That's bad, right?

313
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,109
Very bad.

314
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,350
But there's no need to panic.

315
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,879
Finally, I urge you
to offer a course in CPR.

316
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,917
I noticed it wasn't
part of your curriculum.

317
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,435
I'm certified and I have found
great peace of mind...

318
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,431
...knowing I may
save a life someday.

319
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,399
So hot, so hot, so hot, hot!

320
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,070
Yeah, we know we're hot
Sorry that you're not

321
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,435
We go
Ching, ching, ching, ching

322
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,957
Cha-ching, where's the money?
Cha-ching, where's the money?

323
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,349
Oh, my God!
Corky!

324
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,875
Oh, my God. No, no, no.
No, my brother's choking!

325
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,637
My brother's choking!
Does anyone know CPR?

326
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,199
Does anyone know CPR?

327
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,790
I do. I know CPR.

328
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,837
Excuse me.

329
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,072
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

330
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,752
Oh, my God.

331
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,239
Oh, you idiot!

332
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,394
You were supposed to kiss her.
Lip-lock. That was the plan.

333
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,838
I'm looking forward to the journey.

334
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,230
And I don't care
if a woman unaccompanied...

335
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,994
...is considered to be shameful.

336
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,314
I've done nothing wrong.
My heart is...

337
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,358
Yes? Your heart is?

338
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,999
Cut.

339
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,915
I'm sorry.

340
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,672
Well, I don't know how much more time.

341
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,510
And action.

342
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,833
I'm looking forward to the journey...

343
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,389
...and I don't care that...

344
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,518
- I feel sick. I need to stop.
- Cut.

345
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,072
What are you doing?

346
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,352
I'm sorry.

347
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,188
The door was unlocked.

348
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,511
The shutters had rusted closed,
and the bulbs were all burnt-out.

349
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,318
Oh, leave it on.

350
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,472
I haven't been here
since the night she...

351
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,036
You were here the night she died?

352
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,272
How long did you work for her?

353
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,919
Year I got out of the service,
I went to work at the studio.

354
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,792
They sent me over here
to project a film for her...

355
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,952
...and she asked me to stay
and take care of her, so I did.

356
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,436
That was 1971.

357
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,634
When she disappeared,
did you know where she was?

358
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,313
No.

359
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,271
She never married
and she seemed to be very private...

360
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,831
...but there must have been a...
There must have been a man...

361
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,629
Someone she loved?

362
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,118
Every man who met her
fell in love with her.

363
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,759
It just couldn't be helped.

364
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,032
I just don't know
if she ever felt love herself.

365
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,278
Hi. Yeah, I'm sorry
about the weirdness the other day.

366
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,035
I have to say,
my feelings were a little bruised.

367
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,034
But, thank you, Corky.
An apology is the sign of a gentleman.

368
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,918
Inga roped me into the shenanigans.

369
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,753
She's my sister,
but I also think she might be the devil.

370
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,559
Also, you know, I thought
if you gave me mouth-to-mouth...

371
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,871
...it would be a fantastic way for us
to get to know each other.

372
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,996
The truth is, you're awesome.

373
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,839
By the way, did you know
there's a mystery to this house?

374
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,359
I know.

375
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,468
I only recently discovered...

376
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,471
...that movies aren't shot
from beginning to end.

377
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,471
So I took the last movie
she ever made...

378
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,871
...and reassembled the shots
in the order they were photographed.

379
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,989
Okay.

380
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,552
I just noticed something strange.

381
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,872
The last month before she disappeared,
she's only shown from here up.

382
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,552
Maybe she was pregnant.

383
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,958
She didn't have any kids.
Never married and no kids.

384
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,792
It's just a hunch.

385
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,590
Also, the photograph in this magazine
is dated just after her reappearance.

386
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,193
There's an X on her robe.

387
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,920
I believe that insignia will tell us
where she was hiding.

388
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,992
I've called the hospitals and hotels
that include the letter X...

389
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,071
...but so far, nothing.

390
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,516
I need to talk to someone
who's an expert in clothing.

391
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,549
Oh, and one more thing.

392
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,910
She's often with this man,
but he's always obscured.

393
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,669
A hand at the edge of a picture,
a silhouette...

394
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,637
...even a blur.

395
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,268
I think she called him Z.
I have to find out who this man is.

396
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,915
I just have to solve this case.

397
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,789
What do you think?

398
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,835
I think the ability to sleuth
is an attractive quality in a woman.

399
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,677
Hey, don't they have a Costume
Department on the set of every film?

400
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,798
Yeah, but you should know
that movie people are kind of crazy.

401
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,439
Oh, goodness.
How crazy can they be?

402
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,589
Really crazy.

403
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,749
Dude, are we on yet?

404
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,831
No, I gotta be on one more...

405
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,909
You' re fine.

406
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,594
- Oh, I just had a question.
- And I'm all out of answers.

407
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,955
You look '50s. Go to set.

408
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,190
- But I was just wondering if maybe...
- Now!

409
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,998
Here we go. Okay, we're moving.

410
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,152
We're moving, people.
We're on our way.

411
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,231
We are moving!

412
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,755
MAN Hey, guys,
this is good. They got the feed up.

413
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,397
All right, let's just shoot the rehearsal.
Has anybody seen Mr. Fancy-Pants?

414
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,676
Right here, you idiot.

415
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,671
Ah, nickname, I love a nickname.

416
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,115
It's not a nickname, Andy.
It's not a nickname.

417
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,872
You really are an idiot.

418
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,553
All right.
Copy that. On our way.

419
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,392
Okay, we're shooting the rehearsal!

420
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,279
Stop with the bowing.
Excuse me, sir. No, sir. No, I...

421
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,750
By the way, it's "action,"
not "begin the acting."

422
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,035
When you're right, you're right.

423
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,189
Action.

424
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,794
Locking it up! Last looks, everybody.
Last looks.

425
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,871
- Walking away. Walking away.
- Quiet, please.

426
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,349
And we're rolling.

427
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,555
Rolling!
We're rolling!

428
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,439
You're cute.
Thank you.

429
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,235
Okay, you hate crime, and action!

430
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,311
Hold him right there, boys.

431
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,831
Spider Weintraub.
As I live and breathe.

432
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,237
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney...

433
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,799
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but...

434
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,997
- What?
- I'm sorry. This just feels inauthentic.

435
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,149
Feels what?

436
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,356
Well, the scene takes place
in the '50s...

437
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,953
...but you're reading Miranda
to the suspect.

438
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,478
Excuse me. Why in the name of sweet
Christmas is this tiny person talking?

439
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,478
Well, reading of Miranda
upon arrest wasn't law until '63.

440
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,914
Is that right?

441
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,911
The scene is still delicious, either way.

442
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,952
- What's your name, hon?
- Uh, Nancy Drew.

443
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,318
I'm Bruce.

444
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,278
All right, I'll tell you what, why
don't you direct the movie, Nancy Drew?

445
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,919
Oh, my God!

446
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,308
Should we cut?

447
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,994
Listen, Nancy, would you consider,
you know, directing this film?

448
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,109
Because we can
get rid of this guy in a second.

449
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,159
Is there a law against common courtesy
in Los Angeles?

450
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
Courtesy is so awesome.
I'm really into it.

451
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,553
In my book, courtesy counts.

452
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,915
I'd like to read that book, Nancy.

453
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,509
It's not an X.
They're palm trees.

454
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,395
Okay. What does that mean?

455
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,758
The insignia on her robe.

456
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,079
It's, um...

457
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,959
Something Palms.

458
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,032
Oh, now I get it.
Just kidding, I don't.

459
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,637
Southern Pines.
California Hot Springs. No.

460
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,555
Twin Palms Bungalows and Spa.

461
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,033
There was a fire some 20 years ago
and all the records were burned.

462
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,518
And on top of that,
I'm afraid our guest list is confidential.

463
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,873
Where's the closest hospital?

464
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,308
All the children born in one week
24 years ago?

465
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,278
Yes. Well, all the ones given up
for adoption.

466
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,159
The birth mother,
she may have left money for the child...

467
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,151
I'm sorry, but those records
are sealed.

468
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,231
Only a court order
can open those records.

469
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,119
And only by a child seeking a parent.
Are you the child?

470
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,269
No.

471
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,119
But, um, thank you, anyway.

472
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,590
Here's a blondie for your trouble.

473
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,358
Did...? Did you make these?

474
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,990
No. Hannah, our housekeeper
back in River Heights, did.

475
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,879
She sent over a tin.
She's a wonderful baker.

476
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,789
It's so weird.
My mother made these when I was a kid.

477
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,554
I haven't had one in years.

478
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,309
It's so perfectly moist.

479
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,589
Come here.

480
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,679
The county recommends a pediatrician
to new adoptive parents.

481
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,997
The doctor's files aren't sealed.
This might help.

482
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,232
- Thank you.
- And you didn't get that from me.

483
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,713
Ha. Twenty-four years ago.
Wow, that is so long ago.

484
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,518
Yes. It would have been
a first appointment, a newborn.

485
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,468
I know it seems a little "disorganisized"
but I know where everything is.

486
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,839
Ow.

487
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,918
Right there. Here it is.
There were two newborns that week.

488
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,196
No, make that three.

489
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,830
Oh, but I don't think
I can release any information.

490
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,989
Let me call headquarters.

491
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,276
Ha, ha, maybe that's them. Hello?

492
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,429
Hey, girl. It's Jimmy.

493
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,036
Oh, Jimmy. Yeah, no, I was looking
for it, then I found it. I found it.

494
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,872
I did find it and it's...

495
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,713
That's not it, but it's pink.
And it wasn't...

496
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,598
No, it wasn't where
I thought it was...

497
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,354
- I think it's yellow.
- Because I put it somewhere else.

498
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,910
Yeah. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I'm gonna have to call you ba...

499
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,991
I'm gonna have to call you back.

500
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,312
Ha. Nice try, squirt. Nice try.

501
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,752
Hello, I'm looking for Jane Brighton.

502
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,555
Are you Jane Brighton?

503
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,319
Are you Martine Dahlberg?

504
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,993
Yeah. Why?

505
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,197
I was just wondering,
were you adopted?

506
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,554
Are you Susan Thabit?

507
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,950
Were you adopted?

508
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,315
- Are you Martine Dahlberg?
- Yes.

509
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,515
Were you adopted?

510
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,189
Hello...

511
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,395
Can I help you?

512
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,232
Sorry, no.

513
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,389
No.

514
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,679
No.

515
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,915
Hello?
Um, is there a Jane Brighton here?

516
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,516
Ugh, that depends on who's asking.

517
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,636
Were you adopted?

518
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,838
Yeah.

519
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,752
Who are you?

520
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,592
You're who I'm looking for.

521
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,269
I am?

522
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,709
Hi.

523
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,348
You're kidding.

524
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,670
Did your parents tell you
that you were adopted?

525
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,231
It wasn't hard to figure out.
I mean, I didn't look anything like them.

526
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,317
My mother passed away,
and then my father...

527
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,394
I had to get away from him.

528
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,036
Uh, I left home early.

529
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,518
Dehlia Draycott.

530
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,116
Dehlia may have made a
provision for you.

531
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,748
If we prove you're her daughter,
there may be some money.

532
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,072
Is this some kind of a practical joke?

533
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,879
Oh, no. I don't joke.

534
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,751
I get that a lot.
I'm 12, but I skipped a few grades.

535
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,512
Because you were ahead academically?

536
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,319
Heck, no. There just wasn't
any action in junior high...

537
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,675
...so my dad made a few calls.

538
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,912
Anyway, I was wondering
if we could do, like, a dinner thing?

539
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,230
Like, Saturday-ish?
Not a date.

540
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,356
Corky, you've been really nice to me...

541
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,670
I'll show you the sights.
We'll have a few laughs.

542
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,717
...but there's this guy
in River Heights.

543
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,314
Oh, ouch. Okay.

544
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,392
Well, you still need to eat,
and it's not a date.

545
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,551
Okay. Seeing as how it's not a date...

546
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,110
What was th...?
Go. Go, go, go.

547
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,474
That car, it almost hit us.

548
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,916
Hurry! Go, go, go!
Hey!

549
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,679
I wonder who tried to kill us.

550
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,435
Yeah, I'm wondering that too.
In fact, I'm kind of freaking out about it.

551
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,558
Well, usually when someone
tries to kill me...

552
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,234
...it's because I'm onto something.

553
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,436
Oh, you have a cut.

554
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,672
There were dealer plates on the SUV.

555
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,115
I made note of the make,
year and model.

556
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,796
Plus, the damage sustained from hitting
the barrier could help us identify it too.

557
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,071
You're just not like the other girls,
Nancy.

558
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,472
Hello?

559
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,349
Do not look into this
Dehlia Draycott business.

560
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,796
If you proceed, you will be harmed.
Do you understand?

561
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,551
We' re not interested
in mudslide insurance...

562
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,075
...but, um, thank you for calling.
Have a nice day.

563
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,389
Whoa, what's this?

564
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,552
I apologize, sir.
Allow me to introduce myself.

565
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,792
My name is Nancy Drew.
It's very nice to make your acquaintance.

566
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,150
I've been trying to set up
an appointment, but...

567
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,279
Posture, eye contact.
Pay attention, people, that's breeding.

568
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,955
I was just wondering if I could have five
minutes to discuss something with you.

569
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,634
Any time at all.
Here's my card.

570
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,398
Thank you.

571
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,551
It's about one of your clients,
a movie star.

572
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,917
Ha, ha, all my clients
are movie stars, muffin.

573
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,548
Well, I may have found
some evidence suggesting that...

574
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,359
- Astonishing.
- Um, It may imply that...

575
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,953
Absolutely astonishing.

576
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,715
As I was saying...

577
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,871
I'm very disappointed, senator.

578
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,476
Well, as you know,
you do owe me a favor or two.

579
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,116
Well, talk to somebody else
on your staff.

580
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,918
Maybe they can help you out on this.

581
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,748
Jane? Are you there?

582
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,677
Hi. I saw the lawyers who represent
the estate today and they...

583
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,671
It's all right.
I don't need any help.

584
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,794
What? Don't you wanna know
if you're Dehlia's daughter?

585
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,150
Just leave us alone, okay?

586
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,312
You seem like a really nice person.
I'm sorry.

587
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,714
The will is in the Chinese box.

588
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,957
So there is a will.

589
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,716
See for yourself.

590
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,950
Miss Draycott collected chinoiserie.

591
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,954
Last year, the owner sold off the most
valuable pieces, against my wishes.

592
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,350
Do you remember
the name of the dealer?

593
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,394
You ask a lot of questions.

594
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,315
Is it this place? I noticed the ad
was circled. Do they have the box?

595
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,238
Let me tell you something, young lady.

596
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,710
Everyone who has tried to piece
this thing together has run into trouble.

597
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,195
Hello?

598
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,115
So you should be getting an early
birthday present/reward thing...

599
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,716
...for going along with my
"no sleuthing while in California" thing.

600
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,275
Dad, you shouldn't have.

601
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,829
- I don't really deserve it.
- Yes, you do.

602
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,354
I know it hasn't been easy for you...

603
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,590
...and this'll make me feel less guilty.

604
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,398
But what is it?

605
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,028
Uh, just walk outside.

606
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,270
Hi. My sister dropped me off
and now she won't go away.

607
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,229
Leave!

608
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,312
My roadster.
Dad, how did you get it here?

609
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,959
Happy almost-your-birthday.

610
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,675
Ned.
You drove this all the way here?

611
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,468
Uh, yeah, it wouldn't fit
in my suitcase.

612
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,518
Huh, I've missed this car so much...

613
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,830
...and you.
I've missed the car and you.

614
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,509
Oh, Ned, Corky. Corky, Ned.

615
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,956
Ned is my...

616
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,429
...really good friend
from River Heights.

617
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,797
River Heights, right.
That's in one of those fly-over states.

618
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,111
Wait. Did I interrupt something?

619
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,630
Yes, actually. You did.

620
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,509
Hello?

621
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,194
- Hello? Nancy?
- Oh, Dad. Thank you so much.

622
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,873
We have to go.

623
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,796
Corky's going on a date with her?

624
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,839
Whoa, Nancy Weirdo has,
like, two dates.

625
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,629
Oh, that other one is cute.

626
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,872
I don't usually go for the
just-back-from-slopping-the-hogs type...

627
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,112
...but, ha, he's cute.

628
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,354
Hello.
Would you like to order some drinks?

629
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,715
I'll have a glass of milk, please.

630
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,158
Ah, milk. How refreshingly wholesome.
I'll have the exact same thing.

631
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,589
Who is this person?

632
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,911
Nancy and I met,
and things just clicked.

633
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,754
We laugh, we talk.
We keep it real.

634
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,195
- Keep it real?
- We're basically best friends.

635
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,157
It's funny
that she never mentioned you.

636
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,631
Hey, buddy, she wants your drink order.

637
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,075
Um, can I get an iced latte?

638
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,875
hNo latte in Chinese restaurant, silly.

639
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,558
Yeah, silly.
No latte in the Chinese restaurant.

640
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,709
Don't talk to me.

641
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,792
All right.
Wow, this is fun, huh?

642
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,474
Ned and I have known
each other since second grade.

643
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,552
He helped me solve the mystery
of the missing chalkboard erasers.

644
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,475
It was a janitor.

645
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,234
Oh, fantastic.

646
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,919
Oh, my gosh.
How funny.

647
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,390
Here we are and here you are.
Hi, what's your name?

648
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,549
Ned?

649
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,359
You're not sure?

650
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,432
No. I mean, yes, I'm sure.

651
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,589
Why are you here?

652
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,479
Why are you here?

653
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,629
Why are you here?

654
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,952
Hey, hey, guys, don't gang up on me.
I'm sensitive.

655
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,230
Hello. I'm looking for a box.
That is, one in particular.

656
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,469
What kind of box?

657
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,709
Chinese?

658
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,394
Well, you've come to the right place.

659
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,793
So this is why
you wanted Chinese food.

660
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,396
What are you guys doing in here?
This is so nonlinear.

661
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,994
Everybody pick a row.
Check inside each box.

662
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,759
We're looking for a will.

663
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,673
- Wait, what's over there?
- Hey.

664
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,114
Ned, did you see this box yet?

665
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,549
Nothing there.

666
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,916
No, no, no. Don't... Don't touch.
Corky.

667
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,396
Hey, watch the top.
That is very expensive.

668
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,195
Hey there. Come here.
You see this? It's big.

669
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,078
Put that down.

670
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,159
What? You think you're funny?
Do you think you're funny?

671
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,072
So not cute.

672
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,075
There is one more.

673
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,393
So, Nance, what's the deal
with you and Ned?

674
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,629
Do you hear something?

675
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,030
No, I mean, are you two like a thing?

676
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,278
Excuse me,
I have to defuse this bomb.

677
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,193
Ugh, no kidding.
Love is a battlefield.

678
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,958
Nancy.

679
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,314
That's the SUV
that tried to run us down.

680
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,629
The side's damaged. Come on.

681
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,711
What was that?
Are you okay? What was that?

682
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,077
- Hurry, we're losing them.
- Oh, so you meant literally a bomb.

683
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,595
What was that?
What was that? Are you okay?

684
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,749
Hello?

685
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,834
They turned up that street!

686
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,195
Hold on. I thought we were
driving away from them.

687
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,679
That's why I got in the car.

688
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,433
- Buckled up?
- I'm fine.

689
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,637
Buckling up.

690
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,515
Say we do catch up with them,
what happens then?

691
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,429
Seriously.

692
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,353
It gets my goat when
someone tries to kill me. It's so rude.

693
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,272
But it only makes me
wanna try harder.

694
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,555
Then let the horses run.

695
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,075
We will go the posted speed limit
and no faster.

696
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,753
Everybody in the universe
drives over the speed limit, Nancy.

697
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,514
Nancy is trying to say
the ends do not justify the means.

698
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,159
Your means will lose them.

699
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,073
It's important to judge the ends
and the means independently...

700
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,229
...to do what's right.

701
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,039
Didn't you promise your father
that you wouldn't sleuth?

702
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,788
Aren't you breaking that promise?

703
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,716
What are you gonna do?

704
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,590
I have to stop working on this case.

705
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,432
I have to stop and be normal.

706
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,795
What's this?

707
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,833
Oh, just normal stuff.
Normal teenage stuff.

708
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,550
Okay. Carry on.

709
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,679
- He just pinched me!
- Deal with it.

710
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,673
If we're gonna baby-sit him,
we should get paid.

711
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,118
Ned, why is your shirt all wrinkled?

712
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,518
Because my closet's 6 inches deep.

713
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,554
That's not possible.
How could...?

714
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,549
Show me.

715
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,390
What are you guys doing?

716
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,675
"Hey, Corky.
We're super glad you asked.

717
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,512
Would you like to tag along? "

718
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,153
Seriously. Oh, God.
What is going on?

719
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,909
I just fell down.

720
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,954
But I'm fine.

721
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,440
I still don't know what's going on.

722
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,875
Whenever you feel like letting me know.

723
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,630
A secret passageway.

724
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,593
So this is how the intruder
has been getting upstairs.

725
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,352
This is nuts.

726
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,592
Ned, will you get my flashlight?
It's in my kit.

727
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,952
Wouldn't this be considered sleuthing?

728
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,318
Who are we kidding?
I can't stop.

729
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,034
Once I find the will
and determine the identity of Z...

730
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,317
...I'll tell my father everything.
He'll understand.

731
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,313
I mean, how else
am I gonna help Jane?

732
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,829
It's important.

733
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,069
Don't you think?

734
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,709
Yeah.

735
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,555
What was that?

736
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,157
I think we just had an earthquake.

737
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,475
Hello?

738
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,432
Nancy.

739
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,591
Are you all right?

740
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,749
Where are you?

741
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,236
I'm in the basement.

742
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,831
Do you see anything?

743
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,838
I found a tunnel and I'm going in.

744
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,514
If I'm not back in 10 minutes,
something bad's happened.

745
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,991
I don't think that was a joke.

746
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:30,636
I lay there on the ground
Who will wind the clock when I'm away

747
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,589
Hi.

748
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,836
A tunnel in the laundry room.

749
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,195
What the hell is that all about?

750
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,590
John Leshing.
He's a tenant in this building.

751
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,876
He's the caretaker
of the Dehlia Draycott estate.

752
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,190
If anyone knows about the tunnel,
he does.

753
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,318
That man has always
given me the willies.

754
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,790
The drowning-kittens type.
You know what I mean?

755
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,269
Hi. These are for you two.

756
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,194
- Here you go.
- Okay.

757
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,151
These are for you two.

758
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,352
I hope you attend.

759
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,756
I know that she's weird,
but we have to go.

760
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,194
Why?

761
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,352
Ned, my future husband,
is gonna be there.

762
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,591
Jane? It's me, Nancy.

763
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,150
I was wondering if you and Allie
wanted to come to a party.

764
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,034
Oh, my goodness.

765
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,714
Wow, guys, your streamers look great.

766
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,438
Let's see yours.

767
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,910
Yeah, yours are all right.

768
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,351
Downloading's cool...

769
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,798
...but nothing sounds like vinyl.

770
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,997
You couldn't be more right
if you tried, Nancy.

771
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,109
Yeah.

772
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,069
- Hi.
- Hi.

773
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,800
I brought a few friends.
I hope you don't mind, all right?

774
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,279
No.

775
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,752
Oh, I didn't get the memo
about it being a retarded theme.

776
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,035
Hey, Ned.

777
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,235
Hi.

778
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,868
Oh, can I take your coat or...?

779
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,314
Okay.

780
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,668
Um, refreshments
are in the dining room.

781
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,400
We'll be having a taffy pull later, guys.

782
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,871
Come on in.
Hi.

783
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,951
Refreshments in the dining room.

784
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:15,636
Oh, hello.
Hi. Oh, you look lovely.

785
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,031
Leshing, come quick!

786
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,354
So did you grow up in River Depths?
Tell me about it. Is there a river?

787
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,034
River Heights.
Uh, yeah, there's a river.

788
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,398
Oh, I knew that. I totally knew that.
How did I know that? Ha, ha, ha.

789
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,198
Hey. Hey.

790
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,588
Oh, you wanna dance, right?

791
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,435
Hi.

792
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,110
Oh, I just wanted to ask you if you knew
about the secret passageway.

793
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,078
I think you got your answer.

794
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,874
Are you Z?

795
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:13,636
Miss Drew, I suggest you rejoin
your guests and enjoy the party.

796
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,478
Hold on.

797
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,949
Hello?

798
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,475
I warned
you, drop this Draycott business.

799
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,629
Who is this?

800
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,433
- Please, stop calling here.
- Nancy?

801
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,672
Oh, hi, Dad.
Where are you?

802
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,319
I'm going to be even later

803
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,038
to your party than I said.
I'm sorry, honey.

804
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,555
Is everything all right?
Sounds a little crazy there.

805
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,711
Y eah, everything's totally mellow.

806
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,953
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely. Hurry home.

807
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,957
Happy birthday, Nancy.

808
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,949
Back off, man.

809
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,512
Somebody call 911.

810
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,558
You! You know CPR, come on,
do something. Trish is choking!

811
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,876
This is not a joke.

812
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,755
Out of the way, out of the way.
Coming through.

813
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,480
Oh, my God. Do something,
do something. Somebody call 911!

814
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,993
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

815
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,039
Does she have any allergies?

816
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,033
She's insanely allergic to peanuts,
but she didn't eat anything.

817
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,158
I had a peanut butter cookie,
and we were making out.

818
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,639
Oh, my God.

819
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,791
I need a knife and a ballpoint pen.

820
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,992
Here.
Here you go.

821
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,675
Everybody, unless you've had
advanced emergency medical training...

822
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,956
...you must never attempt this
on your own.

823
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,119
Holy crap.

824
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,748
You know, I have to admit...

825
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,914
...I thought you were some insane,
freak, idiot person before, but you're not.

826
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,229
You're pretty terrific.

827
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,030
Anyone can learn
emergency medical procedures.

828
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,509
Uh, I'm talking about
how great the party was.

829
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,511
Saving Trish's life was fantastic also.

830
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,274
Anyways, I'd like to take you
and your little friend Ned out shopping.

831
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,112
You really do need a decent outfit.

832
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,397
What happened?

833
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,518
It was a lively party.
Almost everyone had a good time.

834
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,750
I take it you're Nancy's father.
That's right.

835
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,831
We responded to a complaint
from a neighbor.

836
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,835
Dad, this is Sergeant Billings.

837
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,878
No, no, no.
Let me say something.

838
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,829
You had a wild party.

839
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,356
You blew it out when Dad was MIA.

840
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,114
Damage was done.
Things went amuck. I get it.

841
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,989
Congratulations.

842
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,354
Getting rowdy is part of being
a normal, non-sleuthing teenager.

843
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,230
All right. That's a first.

844
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,435
Come on. Come on.

845
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,671
Hi. Obviously someone here
needs a little help with their look.

846
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,876
Oh, it's not that bad.

847
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,996
Oh, please, it's a fashion teardown.

848
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,709
You have some nice pieces.
They're just not really working together.

849
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,153
Me? I was talking about her.

850
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,675
Oh, sorry.

851
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,872
Wow, where did you get that dress?

852
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,434
Um, I made it from one
of my mother's patterns.

853
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,832
Oh, it is just darling.
I love the sincerity.

854
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,592
I have to take your picture.

855
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,992
You know what? I just remembered
how much I really hate this store.

856
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,949
Excuse me?

857
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,473
I wish you could stay longer.

858
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,676
My mom said if I stayed
past the weekend...

859
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,114
...that she'd turn my room into a den.

860
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,589
Really?

861
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,911
Anyway, Nancy,
I just want you to know...

862
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,752
...that I'm not interested
in that Inga person.

863
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,156
In fact, she scares me.

864
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,949
And that if you like this Porky guy...

865
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,559
Corky.

866
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,358
...it's all right with me.

867
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,633
Ned, he's 12.

868
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,315
You just seem to really like
having him around.

869
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,999
Ned, can I ask you a question?

870
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,835
Can you tell when a girl
is thinking how much she likes you...

871
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,310
...wondering if you like her, thinking
how important it is how you feel...

872
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,313
...before she says anything more
about how she feels about you...

873
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,438
...because she's already saying
how she feels in her own way?

874
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,828
Can you repeat the question?

875
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,709
Your cab's here.
Sorry to see you go, Ned.

876
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,552
I'll, uh, see you soon.

877
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,233
Bye, Ned.

878
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,075
Jane, are you all right?

879
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,836
No. Child Protective Services, they...
They took her. They took Allie.

880
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,030
They said I was an unfit parent,
but it isn't true.

881
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,191
I didn't do any
of the things that they said.

882
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,035
Uh, come in, come in.

883
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,631
You're always able to help people.

884
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,789
I can certainly try.

885
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,632
Why don't you come
downtown tomorrow?

886
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,598
I will. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

887
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,036
Sure. What's the connection?
How did you two meet?

888
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,078
I'm Dehlia Draycott's daughter.

889
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,319
You're what? Wait.

890
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,916
Dad, it's so late.
Jane's tired and so am I.

891
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,390
Let's go over all this in the morning,
in the promising light of a new day.

892
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,913
Right.
Have you been sleuthing?

893
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,311
Dad, do you really think
I've been sleuthing?

894
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,954
- That's not answering my question.
- You're not answering mine.

895
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,229
- Your what?
- What?

896
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,389
- What?
- What?

897
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,039
I'm going to bed.

898
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,831
Good night.

899
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,720
Uh, listen, I have to tell you
something.

900
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,759
Right after you first found me, someone
came to my apartment. Uh, a man.

901
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,879
He said if I ever tried to prove that I was
Dehlia's daughter, that I would regret it.

902
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,600
That's why I was afraid
to talk to you that time.

903
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,753
- What did he look like?
- He was big...

904
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,151
Dark hair. Scary.

905
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,315
And he had one pale blue eye
and one very, very dark.

906
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,992
Someone is filing grievances
against you, but I don't know who yet.

907
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,913
But it isn't true.
None of it happened.

908
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,310
How can they just take a kid
away from its mother?

909
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,995
I believe you. And I think a judge
will too. It just takes time.

910
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,628
We'll get her back.
I promise you.

911
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,112
Now, is there anyone
who might have something against you?

912
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,674
Dad, look,
there's something I need to tell you.

913
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,159
It has to do with this whole...

914
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,912
Carson!

915
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,069
Nancy.

916
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,755
After Jane's little revelation, I found out
who the lawyer for the estate was...

917
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,148
...and I gave him a call.

918
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,519
He and I are going to talk privately.
Do you have your car?

919
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,071
Down the block.
What are you two...?

920
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,516
Dinner, tonight.
I've got a lot of questions...

921
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:21,194
...and I think you
just might have the answers.

922
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,276
Feel like some hot cocoa?

923
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,638
...Channel presents
The Life and Death of Dehlia Draycott.

924
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,234
It's so weird.
I never used to think about her at all...

925
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,879
...and now I see her everywhere.

926
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,236
What if I am an unfit mother?

927
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,914
I don't know what I'm doing.
No one taught me what to do.

928
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,069
Jane...

929
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,630
Nancy, I don't think you understand
what it's like growing up without a mom.

930
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,954
Actually, my mother died
when I was very young.

931
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,673
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

932
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,038
I didn't know.

933
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,558
You've been so nice to me.

934
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,158
Sometimes,
I think I can remember her.

935
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,470
But I never know
if what I'm remembering...

936
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,029
...is something I saw in a picture...

937
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,838
...or just made up.

938
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,717
She's, um...

939
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,032
She's a mystery.

940
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,750
Someone in the village told me

941
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,593
that the will is in the Chinese box.

942
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,033
Wait a minute.

943
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,994
What are we looking for?

944
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,999
A clue.

945
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,639
It's empty.

946
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,758
You must make the dragon bow.

947
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,709
The will.

948
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,359
I must've fallen asleep when I heard this.

949
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,714
I've finally found it.

950
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,271
Dehlia used a clue
from one of her movies...

951
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,317
...to show someone
where to find the will.

952
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,471
Now all I have to do
is make the dragon bow.

953
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,993
Okay, you lost me at "dragon."

954
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,154
I'll be back later.

955
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:29,228
Hello? Hello, Mr. Louie?
Are you in there?

956
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,954
Hello?

957
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,438
I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner...

958
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,272
...but this means so much
to two of my friends.

959
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,873
It's fine.

960
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,952
It's the will.

961
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,400
If you want it, you can have it.

962
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,551
Huh, thank you so much.

963
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,999
"I give all my property and assets
to my daughter born July 28th, 1981."

964
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,798
I knew it.

965
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,997
Dad. I have to talk to you.

966
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,639
What number are you calling from?

967
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,518
My cell phone.
The one you gave me.

968
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,999
I didn't give you a cell phone.

969
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,869
Honey?

970
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,838
I have to get off this phone.
Everything's fine. See you tonight.

971
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,513
Nancy...

972
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,195
So they're the ones
who've been breaking in.

973
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,630
Oh, Mary, you're exaggerating.

974
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,189
No one blames you for Henry's death.

975
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,109
Least of all Jezebel.

976
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,999
You've got to stop.
It's not your fault, Mary.

977
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:28,230
You do believe that, don't you, baby?

978
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,436
You don't think I was born bad,
do you?

979
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:44,430
I could never care
if you were. Mary, I love you.

980
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,359
Go check on her.

981
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,715
Wait. I want to see this part.

982
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,269
Kids will love it
just for making chocolate pasta

983
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,998
for those delicious desserts.

984
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:21,550
Besides pasta, you can also make
pie crust, cinnamon rolls...

985
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,789
She's not there.

986
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,749
- Look again.
She's not there.

987
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,393
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

988
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,671
Go get her!

989
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,233
Hey!

990
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,919
Hey.

991
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,437
She's getting away! Jump!

992
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,998
Go, go, get the car.

993
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,511
You idiots.

994
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,193
Right there.

995
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,192
- Hi, Dad.
- Are you okay? What happened?

996
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,871
Just your run-of-the-mill car accident.

997
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,592
I swerved out of control
because, um...

998
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,154
Because men were chasing me.
I've been working on a case.

999
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,515
Uh, I'm gonna give you two
some time.

1000
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,432
Thank you.

1001
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,828
- I started to tell you today.
- You could have been killed.

1002
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,989
Do you realize that?

1003
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,790
- I was just trying to do the right thing.
- This is a very dangerous city.

1004
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,555
- The world is not like River Heights.
- I know.

1005
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,917
I mean, I tried to be normal.
I really tried.

1006
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,356
I just start working on something
and I can't stop.

1007
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,558
I wonder where you got that from.

1008
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,917
I mean, the idea of a girl out there
without her mom...

1009
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,797
Dehlia wanted to leave Jane the estate,
and I found the will.

1010
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:03,033
Like you always say, "Others first."

1011
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,191
I just wish that
you'd talked to me about this.

1012
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,231
I'll be okay, Dad.
We'll work it out. You're my guy.

1013
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,549
- Hey, kiddo.
- Mr. Biedermeyer.

1014
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,598
Uh, your father and I were going over
some business when we heard.

1015
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,479
I hope you're all right.

1016
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,715
I'm fine.

1017
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,189
Good.

1018
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,113
He's offered me some consulting work.
I can do it from home...

1019
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,192
...so we can go back to River Heights.

1020
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,918
And he pays a lot.

1021
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,278
You know, I couldn't help but
overhear before about the mystery.

1022
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,829
- Did you ever find the will?
- I did.

1023
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,468
Dehlia used one of her movies as a clue.

1024
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,789
It was hidden...

1025
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,394
...in the secret compartment
of a Chinese box.

1026
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,154
Nancy always gets
to the bottom of things.

1027
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,551
Well, my firm would certainly
be interested in seeing that will.

1028
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,076
You know, Mr. Biedermeyer
wasn't always just Dehlia's lawyer.

1029
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,708
He was her manager as well,
from the start.

1030
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,154
He made her who she was.

1031
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,111
Then he brought her account
to his law firm, and...

1032
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,511
Well, it's time to sign
on the dotted line.

1033
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,032
That's, uh, quite a signature.

1034
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,033
It's my middle initial.
For Zachary.

1035
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,077
Z.

1036
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,112
Where is the will?

1037
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,679
Where is it, honey?
Do you know?

1038
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,998
You know, this is a little awkward.

1039
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,513
His firm stands to lose
more than a little income...

1040
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,035
...if the money from the will
really does go to Jane.

1041
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,951
Dad, we have to get out of this car now.

1042
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,993
Why?

1043
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,833
Excuse me, sir,
can you please stop the car?

1044
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,509
Nancy!

1045
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,593
Nancy!

1046
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,515
Dad, get away from them!

1047
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,318
Excuse me, miss?

1048
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,040
Oh, hello, honey.

1049
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,390
Oh, the phone's over there, honey.

1050
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,998
Sergeant Billings.

1051
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,958
Do you know if a Dashiel Biedermeyer
rented in this building?

1052
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,158
No. No, he owns it.

1053
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,873
He owns the house you're in too.

1054
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,758
He's a very rich man.

1055
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,199
There she is.

1056
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,476
Um, is there a back door anywhere?

1057
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,915
Yes, honey, right over there.

1058
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,640
Tell Sergeant Billings
to send a car to the house.

1059
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,079
Get her!

1060
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,478
Open up!

1061
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,075
Open this door!

1062
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,877
- Break it down.
- Come here.

1063
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,635
Where's the will?

1064
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,438
I don't think I should say.

1065
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,830
It's my insurance
that you won't hurt me.

1066
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,636
I'll squeeze it out of you.

1067
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,233
Tell me something first.

1068
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,589
I'm just really curious.

1069
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,228
Why did you kill Dehlia?

1070
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,834
After she gave up the baby,
she went kind of crazy.

1071
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,709
She was gonna quit the business
and run off with that caretaker.

1072
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,950
He was the father.

1073
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:14,272
Whatever. She was my only client.
She was gonna fire me.

1074
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,793
I spent 20 years of my life
building up her career.

1075
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,871
I got mad.
I reacted violently.

1076
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:23,271
I felt kind of bad about it for a while,
but I'm okay with it now.

1077
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,910
Leshing is Jane's father.

1078
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,195
Does he know about the baby?

1079
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,351
It doesn't matter!
Now where is the will?

1080
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,789
It's right here.

1081
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,193
Come here.

1082
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,318
Give it to me!
Give me the will!

1083
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,918
Ah, ah, ah, just do it.

1084
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:18,869
If you shoot me, it'll leave all
sorts of evidence. Very messy.

1085
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,632
Strangulation leaves
a traceable handprint.

1086
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,639
What do you suggest?

1087
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:31,789
The best way to kill me?

1088
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,637
Hm, let me think about that...

1089
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,995
Enough of this crap.

1090
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,713
Put the gun down.
Hey!

1091
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,279
I'm just
really curious. Why did you kill Dehlia?

1092
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,799
After she gave up the baby...

1093
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,393
...she went kind of crazy.

1094
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,312
She was gonna quit the business and...

1095
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,754
Oh, my God!

1096
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,149
Nancy?

1097
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,236
Oh, my gosh,
you won't believe what's happened.

1098
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,871
Hey, Mr. Biedermeyer. Inga Veinshtein.
I'm in water polo with Courtney.

1099
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,679
Your granddaughter.

1100
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,755
Yeah. I remember you.

1101
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,190
Hey, Lurch, digging a hole
or something?

1102
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,875
- Here. Okay. We had to show you this.
- Oh, my goodness!

1103
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,519
It's called "The New Sincerity."

1104
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,911
Yeah, I'm on the forefront.

1105
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,389
I see something I think is cute,
I start wearing it...

1106
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,391
...and in like five seconds,
it's a total trend.

1107
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,675
Penny-loafer fashion moment.

1108
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,034
Oh, I need to borrow that coat.

1109
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,552
Leshing, thank you so much.

1110
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,473
You're welcome. Nancy.

1111
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,510
There's something you should know.
It's about Jane.

1112
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,509
She's your daughter.

1113
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,631
Hey, you with the shovel.
No. It's him.

1114
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,949
Have you seen my father?

1115
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,348
It's a party!

1116
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,750
Nancy, darling, are you okay?

1117
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,069
Oh, good, good.

1118
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,151
- Oh, hi, honey. How are you?
- Hi, Mr. Drew.

1119
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,158
I was locked in a trunk. What happened?
Are you okay?

1120
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,309
Yeah, I'm fine.

1121
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:15,513
Okay, let's get him up.
All right, easy, easy, easy.

1122
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,240
Looks like my new job
might not work out now.

1123
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,356
Yeah. Maybe not.

1124
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,716
So, what exactly happened?

1125
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:26,519
Dad, do you really wanna know?

1126
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:27,749
Yeah.

1127
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,909
Do I?

1128
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,638
I don't know what to say.

1129
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:39,117
Nancy, I want you to know
I appreciate how hard it was...

1130
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,873
...for you to do the right thing.

1131
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,313
I'm very proud of you.

1132
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,394
You know, Barbara Barbara
Realty would be delighted...

1133
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,915
...to continue to rent
this property for you.

1134
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,274
Thanks, but no, thanks.

1135
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,510
Well, what are you gonna do
with this place?

1136
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:06,639
I'm gonna live here, with my kid
and anyone else who needs a place.

1137
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,598
Well, I think maybe you and I
should talk this over before you make...

1138
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,115
Feel free to leave at any time.

1139
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,514
Allie. Allie. Come here.

1140
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,633
There it is.
Just like clockwork.

1141
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,789
What?

1142
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,635
Postpartum depression.

1143
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,632
You're sad the case is over.

1144
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,756
That's ridiculous.
I'm glad it all worked out.

1145
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,669
You're only happy
when there's trouble.

1146
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,516
This I know for sure.

1147
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,958
But that's who you are
and it's all right with me.

1148
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,559
Ned, that's so sweet.

1149
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,997
- Nancy?
- Yes?

1150
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,720
Phone call.
Long distance from Scotland.

1151
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,078
Something about the Loch Ness monster
and some missing diamonds.

1152
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,597
Another case.

1153
01:29:54,305 --> 01:30:00,922
