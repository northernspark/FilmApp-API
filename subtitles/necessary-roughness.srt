{4203}{4268}The Texas State|Fighting ArmadiIIos
{4272}{4397}were the greatest coIIege team|in history; now, they're history.
{4401}{4488}The commission slapped Texas State|with a list of infractions,
{4492}{4592}including recruiting violations,|steroid abuse,
{4596}{4688}illegal payments to players|and, of course, grade tampering.

{5066}{5174}Thanks for joining us.|What's the Iatest on the ArmadiIIos?
{5178}{5291}The penaIties against Texas State|wiII set an exampIe.
{5295}{5339}And the pIayers?

{5441}{5535}- WiII they get new pIayers?|- They must be reaI students.
{5539}{5626}No more schoIarships,|no more monkey business,

{6286}{6407}- l'm finished with football.|- Total control. No pressure to win.
{6411}{6505}- Run a clean programme.|- Last time they fired me!
{6509}{6600}The boosters fired you.|We don't have them any more.
{6604}{6700}We need a man who'll bounce|a player if he takes money.
{6704}{6754}You need an image.
{6758}{6845}l'm offering you the opportunity|to show the world this can be done.
{6849}{6939}You know, your way? Think about it.
{7526}{7575}Get used to it!

{8001}{8078}Good to see you, Wally.|Come on.
{8082}{8159}l thought you'd be pleased,|working together again.
{8163}{8265}Why should l be pleased?|l could coach my own team.
{8269}{8332}Coaching football|in London doesn't count.
{8336}{8430}lt was a good deal. With only|one personal hygiene class.
{8434}{8519}By the way, l understand|you're off the sauce.
{8523}{8617}Don't change the subject.|l shouldn't be second banana.
{8621}{8725}l'll give you free hand.|Stick to defence, offence is mine.
{8729}{8795}You're the big 'O',|l'm the little 'd'.
{8799}{8844}Don't start with me.
{8848}{8948}Your trouble is you bottle|things up, it's not healthy.
{8952}{9010}Something on my mind, l say it.
{9014}{9104}Sometimes it's best|to keep your mouth shut.
{9108}{9225}l suppose l should learn|to dress nice and kiss ass.
{9229}{9300}At least l'm not taking nitro pills.
{9304}{9398}- You tell Purcell about that?|- He didn't ask.
{9402}{9452}Good to be back, huh?

{16258}{16341}Hell, you're throwing those kids|to the wolves!
{16345}{16493}You expect me to get the shit kicked|out of me? What's that gonna prove?
{16497}{16551}Maybe you're right.
{16555}{16650}Maybe you should stay here|with your high school trophies
{16654}{16770}and wonder just how great|you might've been.
{16826}{16892}l'll tell you one thing...
{16896}{17040}...l never saw anybody|fire that football the way you did.
{17162}{17278}l can't interfere on this one.|Dean Elias calls the shots on education.
{17282}{17357}You might consider|kissing his ass a little.

{17558}{17606}Call me a stick-in-the-mud,

{17714}{17788}So do l. l couldn't agree more.

{18676}{18803}Guess l won't be putting you down|for season tickets, huh?

{42022}{42114}Don't worry.|l don't give free rides, Dean.
{42118}{42226}Phillip. And l don't give|free rides either.
{42253}{42320}Hold all calls.
{42338}{42425}You're a special person|here at TSU, l mean that.
{42429}{42547}Harvard, ''The Washington Post'',|yet you chose to come back to me.
{42551}{42601}l meant to say 'us'.
{42605}{42715}That's why you won't disappoint|someone who sees a future in you...
{42719}{42757}...Suzanne.
{42780}{42862}- That's very nice.|- Yes, l know.
{42866}{42973}- Sometimes l can be nice.|- l'm so late. Excuse me.
{42977}{43082}Even in these past few days...|Something of a kinship!
{43120}{43192}And l know you feel it, too.
{43216}{43309}This thing about to happen here|is really funky.
{43313}{43377}Check out a supernova.
{43381}{43480}That's an explosion that|jacks up a star's luminosity
{43484}{43594}to 1 0 to 45th power joules, and|when that happens, cop some shade!
{43598}{43688}l know what you're thinking:|''Will this help me get a job?''
{43692}{43794}No. But they made me watch|this film, so now you must.
{43905}{43962}Class over! Get out!
{43966}{44042}Next time, chapter 8 on gravitation.
{44191}{44289}Mr Paul Blake. The Armadillos' man.|l've been reading about you.
{44293}{44360}What is your interest|in Celestial Mechanics?
{44364}{44497}- lt was either this or Home Ec.|- You took the easy way out, huh?
{44501}{44578}On the farm, you spend nights|staring at the sky.
{44582}{44676}- What for? Praying for rain?|- Something like that.
{44680}{44771}There was an Andre Krimm,|played tackle, Lincoln High.
{44775}{44839}All-State. Big, ugly guy.
{44843}{44913}Bringing back some old memories.
{44917}{44964}You want the story?
{44968}{45113}l got a scholarship for football and|chemistry, but Coach didn't see it.
{45117}{45185}''l didn't want|no chemistry professor!''
{45189}{45260}''Take basket weaving|and kick some butt.''
{45264}{45333}Doesn't look like|you dropped chemistry.
{45337}{45471}BS in five semesters. Masters|in one year. l'm halfway to my PhD.
{45475}{45561}- l'm not bragging.|- Doesn't sound like it...too much.
{45565}{45618}Just a little bit!
{45622}{45714}- You've got a year of eligibility left.|- For football? Get outta town!
{45718}{45800}Stand here and tell me|you don't miss it.
{45804}{45891}l miss some parts.|Going both ways this year?
{45895}{45951}That's the plan, yeah.
{45955}{46048}Look, Andre, we really need you.
{46068}{46166}Man, it's been a long time|since l kicked some butt.
{46170}{46236}l'll see you in class.
{46333}{46406}OK, Banks. Ready? Hut!
{46449}{46557}You're supposed to be hitting|the sled, not humping a butterfly!
{46561}{46671}l want you mean, l want you nasty,|l want you to eat raw meat!
{46675}{46729}Get your ass outta here!
{46733}{46771}All right, next!
{47066}{47189}Andre does not eat raw meat,|'cause Andre is a vegetarian.
{47231}{47294}Eat whatever you want, Andre.
{47435}{47479}Hi, sports fans!
{47483}{47630}Chuck here to bring you coverage|of today's game on campus radio.
{47634}{47752}The ArmadiIIos are getting ready|to kick off their 1 0-game season.
{47756}{47847}l'm all alone,|thanks to the broadcast blackout.
{47851}{47938}The nation's press will miss out|on one hell of a game...
{47942}{48017}...or at least a noble effort.
{49510}{49573}Here come the Texas Bobcats!
{49630}{49673}Come on!
{49876}{49973}The Bobcats came|with a squad of 1 19 pIayers.
{49977}{50126}Over 1 4,000 faithfuI fans drove up in|their Winnebagos and pick-up trucks.
{50175}{50213}Go!
{50319}{50469}And now, here are aII 1 7 of your new|Texas State Fighting ArmadiIIos!

{51010}{51050}- Gentlemen.|- Listen up.
{51054}{51154}Give me 1 00%. Just give me 1 00%.
{51158}{51210}The last time the team took the field,
{51214}{51316}they won a national championship|but lost their self-respect.
{51320}{51376}l want you to get it back.
{51432}{51478}All right!
{51482}{51532}Way to go, guys!
{51567}{51670}- Not much of a crowd.|- We have the home field advantage.
{51674}{51716}The Alamo was the home field!
{52163}{52244}WiIkerson takes the baII|at the five, on the right side.
{52279}{52369}And he is greeted by three Bobcats.|Too bad.
{52373}{52454}He onIy had eight men Ieft to beat.
{52458}{52537}Keep it simple.|Our bread-and-butter play.
{52541}{52606}Brown right, 22 trap. Go ahead!
{52610}{52690}The Bobcats' defence is anchored|by 'Doberman' Harris,
{52694}{52822}AII-American despite missing|two games due to...rabies shots.
{52826}{52899}Hey, High School!
{52903}{53010}Oh, doggy breath!|Bad doggy, bad doggy!
{53046}{53087}Blue, 42.

{53617}{53670}Get the hell out of there!
{53674}{53722}Again, run it.
{53752}{53825}Bobcats! Bobcats!
{53858}{53955}The ArmadiIIos have 2nd down|on their own 1 6.
{54112}{54211}They run the baII again|but onIy Iost two yards.
{54215}{54272}Nice pIay, guys!
{54333}{54371}Third down coming up.
{54375}{54468}Blake's the only Armadillo alive|when the Beatles were together.
{54547}{54623}Again.|Well, they haven't run it yet!
{54696}{54756}OK, guys, quiet down.
{54828}{54925}- Brown, right, 22 trap.|- We just ran that.
{54929}{54977}They're gonna kill us.
{54981}{55062}- They're looking for that one.|- They haven't seen it!
{55066}{55193}- Let's save that for later.|- All right, just settle down.
{55269}{55302}Screw it!
{55306}{55412}Straight up pass blocking.|Fly pattern.
{55416}{55506}Square in, square in. On two, ready?
{55510}{55550}Break!
{55610}{55719}Third down and Iong situation.|Let's see what the 'DiIIos do here.
{55723}{55818}PauI BIake comes to the Iine.|He takes the snap.
{55822}{55884}He's back fast!
{55935}{56064}- He goes deep! He's got a cannon!|- What the hell's that?
{56068}{56181}Featherstone has a step!|He's aII aIone!
{56220}{56309}He's got...|Oh! In and out of his hands!
{56313}{56351}Damn!
{56355}{56422}Oh, no, no, no!
{56686}{56776}- He was wide open. We'll get it.|- Blake, sit down.
{56780}{56872}Popke! You're going in for Blake!
{56876}{56951}l called a running play, not a pass.
{57385}{57460}McKenzie to punt for the ArmadiIIos.
{57488}{57596}Not much of a hang time.|They got a piece of that one!
{57680}{57796}- Send in your defence.|- Samurai?
{57816}{57925}The ArmadiIIos send in their|defence, Eric 'Samurai' Hansen.
{57929}{58063}They're pIaying Iron Man footbaII,|pIaying both offence and defence.
{58067}{58149}The Bobcats, however,|have a fresh squad on the fieId.
{58186}{58249}50 down!
{58295}{58347}Double wing! Double wing!
{58351}{58462}- Double wing! Double wing!|- Motion left! Motion left!
{58466}{58563}- Hey, that's my man!|- l got him! l got him!
{58567}{58679}The ArmadiIIos are giving StiIIman|quadrupIe coverage to the right.
{58683}{58740}Moses is wide open!
{58744}{58800}It's a touchdown!
{58930}{58974}Move, 45!
{59057}{59095}Set!
{59108}{59154}Hut! Hut!
{59158}{59242}Popke's in for BIake,|with a distinctive throwing styIe.
{59246}{59312}Blow the whistle! Blow the whistle!
{59544}{59629}lt'll be a long day|but a good one, right?
{59901}{59951}Boo!
{60044}{60150}PauI BIake has not come back|into the game. I'm sure...
{60358}{60444}Just tell Dean Elias l called.|Thank you.
{60511}{60581}l'd appreciate it. Yes, please.
{60604}{60668}l'll be here. Thank you.
{60672}{60743}- How are you?|- Got a second?
{60747}{60795}Of course, of course.
{60799}{60902}- l think we ought to talk.|- My door's open to my players.
{60906}{61006}- lncluding the ones you bench?|- Even the ones l threw off my team.
{61010}{61055}Sit down, Blake.
{61131}{61212}- l'll give you everything l got...|- lt's not enough.
{61216}{61315}You've ten other guys with you.|l need what they've got, too.

{61395}{61510}l just want to play, Coach.|You want me to hand-off, l'll do it.
{61514}{61635}- lt's your team.|- No, no, it has to be your team.
{61639}{61750}You want me to hang out|with them? Be their pal?
{61754}{61822}l can't tell you how to do that.
{61826}{61938}You'll have to work that out|for yourself.
{62003}{62128}''The crowd seemed taken with|the bull-dogging skills of favourite,''
{62132}{62208}''handsome Wyatt Beaudry|of Comanche Gap,''
{62212}{62307}''who finished eighth|in the steer-wrestling event.''
{62311}{62406}l suppose that qualifies|as a lead for a story, Wyatt.
{62410}{62519}You've got all five 'Ws': what, when,|where, why and especially who.
{62523}{62598}As in ''Who gives a shit?''
{62654}{62788}lf we could move along...|the next one is by Mr Blake.
{62818}{62954}''Gennero's return to the Texas State|Fighting Armadillos was marred''
{62958}{63077}''by a 65-0 shellacking|by the Southwest Texas Bobcats''
{63081}{63155}''at TSU Stadium on Saturday.''
{63175}{63222}That's a solid opening.
{63226}{63339}Sure. He had a great view|from the bench!
{63343}{63416}''This contest wasn't|about one football game.''
{63420}{63566}''lt was a test of one man's ideals.|The Armadillos did that man proud.''
{63570}{63697}''Ed Gennero...|he won because they played.''
{63852}{63931}Dean EIias here, Coach.|Tough outing Saturday.
{63935}{64027}- Thought you had them!|- It was a Iearning experience.
{64031}{64131}- They need a IittIe conditioning.|- Took the words out of my mouth.
{64135}{64287}I can heIp. How about a scrimmage|with a state institution?
{64291}{64396}- Thank you, Dean.|- PIease, Coach. I'm a giver!
{64400}{64452}Cheerio!
{64757}{64875}- l got a funny feeling about this.|- Don't worry, Wally.
{64879}{65004}Dean Elias assured me that|we're dealing with real sportsmen.
{65104}{65160}How do you do?
{65164}{65305}As loyal fans, we're pleased|to help you in your time of need.
{65309}{65394}We look forward|to a spirited workout.

{66081}{66124}Blue, 32!
{66160}{66260}l want you to know something.|l believe you're all innocent.
{66264}{66353}l mean that. l feel a lot of love|on this field today.
{66736}{66808}Come on, you're offside!
{66812}{66916}You know, l usually play tennis|instead of football.
{67179}{67283}- What are you in for?|- Computer fraud.
{67476}{67581}l don't feel so good.|l think l swallowed a finger.
{67594}{67627}Yeah!
{68063}{68157}Wally, come on. Get up.|People are watching!
{68161}{68249}lf this wasn't frigging Astro Turf,|l'd dig my grave!
{68253}{68345}Blakeman pitches to Sarge.|Sarge bumps into his own man!
{68349}{68411}lt's a fumble. Fumbalaya!
{68415}{68491}Sargie 'Fumbalina' Wilkerson|fumbles the ball!
{68495}{68582}Watch the ball.|Concentrate, McKenzie!
{68744}{68840}Looks Iike the ArmadiIIos|may not break the jinx today!
{68844}{68925}They won't break|into that 'W' coIumn.
{68929}{69004}It's sad that in every game|there has to be a Ioser.
{69094}{69141}Bring it up more!
{69145}{69253}The ArmadiIIos are Iooking for|anything to keep their spirits up.
{69257}{69345}Come on, lron Men! Don't give up!

{69432}{69507}Move it, l said! Get it on!
{69511}{69582}Get it on! Move it!
{69653}{69729}They drop their seventh|heartbreaker of the season.
{69733}{69791}A squeaker, 35 - 1 2.
{69795}{69823}Damn!
{69909}{69950}Shit!
{70037}{70166}The ArmadiIIos are 0 - 8,|with two games Ieft in the season.
{70190}{70270}Wyatt, you dumb cowboy asshole!
{70274}{70376}lf you opened a hole for once,|you'd know who to block!
{70380}{70439}- Blame me.|- Right!
{70443}{70506}You couldn't catch a cold in Alaska!

{71105}{71180}lt's not his fault.|The whole team sucks.
{71184}{71252}- Hey, bitch!|- Hey, hey!

{74453}{74512}What are you thinking about?
{74516}{74611}lf l wanted a big brother,|l wouldn't have killed mine!
{74615}{74701}You don't want to mess with us.|We're nobodies.
{74705}{74781}You guys are undefeated, 8 - 0.
{74809}{74890}We'll just take our party|somewhere else.
{74931}{74993}OK...OK.
{75012}{75077}Tell you what l'm going to do...
{75118}{75252}...l'll buy you a beer, and we can|forget this incident. lt's on me.
{75426}{75489}Now it's on you.
{75501}{75562}Guess you wanted a light beer.
{75566}{75736}Maybe you better buy me a keg.|Or put a spigot in that fat Buddha!
{75752}{75790}Easy.
{75811}{75961}We were getting along so good,|and now you insult my centre.
{75965}{75998}My centre!
{76060}{76128}This is my throwing hand here.
{76199}{76234}Shit!
{76310}{76367}He bought you a beer!
{76735}{76819}- You all right?|- Great until a chair hit me.
{76900}{76994}Sheriff?|Yeah, it's Billy Bob's again.
{77460}{77535}You finally threw something|that connected!
{77539}{77636}Next time we invite you out,|keep your white butt at home!
{77640}{77744}l thought you said|you wanted to 'partay'.
{78911}{78988}What took you so long, Dean?
{78992}{79078}l'm Dean Elias,|l heard about the brawl on my beeper.
{79082}{79164}So...where's the brawl?
{79168}{79326}- Brawl? There ain't no brawl.|- ''There isn't any brawl.''
{79330}{79421}- There ain't no brawl?|- You hard of hearing?
{79425}{79524}Buy the sheriff a coffee,|l'll take care of this, huh?
{79528}{79578}That's a good idea.
{79601}{79695}Don't get yourself in 'no' trouble,|you hear?
{79725}{79764}Let's go.
{79800}{79865}'Any' trouble.
{79869}{79989}Hurts when they poke you|in the chest like that, doesn't it?
{80023}{80130}l don't think|you get the idea, Elias.
{80134}{80288}lf our boys get caught in a brawl,|that means the Colts get caught.
{80292}{80426}You don't get elected sheriff|by embarrassing the pride of Texas.
{80524}{80607}For a quarter, you can jump in.
{80627}{80726}Another game, another time,|Coach Gennero.
{80851}{80897}Blake!
{80901}{80951}Let's talk.

{81392}{81445}We're just blowing off steam.
{81449}{81582}You can't afford to act like normal|students. You can't blow off steam.
{81586}{81687}Dean Elias is looking|for any excuse to bury us.
{81723}{81772}Coach, l'm sorry.
{81776}{81846}You'll never win unless|you control your team.
{81850}{81960}- l'm just trying to...|- Just answer one thing for me.
{81964}{82039}Who threw the first punch?

{83431}{83516}l went because l thought|that's what he wanted.
{83520}{83659}l'm trying to read this man's mind.|Should l protect him? Drink with him?
{83663}{83711}Thanks.

{85532}{85617}You have no idea|what you did to me!
{85621}{85729}Wait a second.|ls this all about a grudge?
{85733}{85787}A grudge?

{85915}{85995}l made my friends|drive past your farm.
{85999}{86102}l used to call and hang up.|l was nuts about you.
{86106}{86178}Can we take a walk?
{86457}{86556}We play the Jayhawks Saturday|and we have no kicker.
{86560}{86625}- We'll find a kicker.|- Where?

{86723}{86821}- Wally, this way.|- No, let's get some air.

{92104}{92183}The ArmadiIIos have put|on a tremendous defence,
{92187}{92262}not aIIowing a touchdown|in three quarters.

{92360}{92463}that the homecoming queen|runner-up is in satisfactory condition,

{92743}{92816}But in a typhoon,|it's anybody's game.

{96064}{96185}- Field goal. On the snap. Ready?|- Break!
{96204}{96268}BIake wiII spot for a 34-yard try.
{96272}{96331}All right, Miss, let's go!
{96373}{96443}Hey, sugar! Don't get nervous!
{96458}{96597}- That the only way you can score?|- Shut up or you'll anger me!
{96610}{96706}CIock's stopped|with just three seconds Ieft.

{98563}{98614}A reaI confidence booster!
{98618}{98715}The Iast game of the season|on Saturday night.
{98872}{98998}Can you believe that? One man|between me and a touchdown!
{99002}{99086}- l blew it!|- Paul, you tied.
{99090}{99146}We could've won!
{99150}{99250}lt's the best the team|has played all season.
{99285}{99374}- Are you trying to cheer me up?|- Yeah.
{99420}{99526}God! Suzanne, how could you?|l'm shocked!
{99530}{99634}You're a highly regarded faculty|member and l'm disappointed.
{99638}{99711}Phillip, it's none of your concern.
{99715}{99796}Excuse us,|we're having a conversation.
{99800}{99863}Conversations have words,|not tongues.
{99867}{99918}Let me handle this.
{99922}{100035}- Will you jeopardise your career?|- We're consenting adults.
{100039}{100104}So were Bonnie and Clyde!
{100108}{100207}- Mind your own business. Tell him.|- Don't pressure me.

{100306}{100406}- Get lost!|- Would you stay out of this!
{100476}{100549}Why don't you just tell him?
{100581}{100629}Fine.
{100668}{100709}Paul...
{100805}{100871}l was... All right!
{100903}{100943}That was easy.
{100947}{101038}Out! Everybody out!|Get out of the shower!
{101042}{101119}Lucy's got to shower, man! Get out!
{101123}{101234}Come on, Lucy's got to shower!|Have some respect!
{101532}{101636}Have some respect!|l can't believe you guys!
{101859}{101998}This is silly. l'm not going|across campus for a shower.
{102002}{102073}l'm an Armadillo, like the others.
{102077}{102171}You're an Armadillo,|but not like the others.
{102317}{102381}You're OK, Manu.
{102538}{102651}Would you do me the honour|of escorting you to Edison's party?
{102655}{102743}All right,|but don't try to carry me in.

{103525}{103623}Excuse me, can everyone|quiet down, please?
{103627}{103717}My father would like|to say a few words.
{103833}{103990}Boys, you played a hell of a game|against a major college tonight!
{104068}{104223}Those jackets look great. Just|a token of the alumni's appreciation.
{104227}{104342}So wear them with pride.|Keep up the good work.
{104346}{104463}Stand up, let's see those jackets.|1 00% cashmere!
{104607}{104718}What's going on here?|Take the jackets off, party's over.
{104722}{104795}This team will not accept gifts.
{104799}{104881}That's how it starts,|but not this team!
{104885}{104944}Leave the goddamn jackets.
{104948}{105028}This is a private party.|Let's talk...
{105032}{105107}Dad, can you do me a favour?
{105121}{105200}Can you just|butt out of this one, OK?
{105204}{105284}- We'll talk about this later.|- Yeah.
{105288}{105393}- Guys, let's go.|- Take it easy, they're just kids.

{105500}{105555}lt's not about me.
{105584}{105714}lt's not about them, though it should|be. They've been killing themselves.
{105718}{105835}No, it's about you trying to prove|something to the world.
{105839}{105975}- Relax and let them feel good!|- l can't and neither can you.
{105979}{106055}Get it through your head,|high school is over.
{106059}{106122}You want to be a leader? Grow up!
{106126}{106210}- Tonight doesn't change the rules.|- Rules?
{106232}{106315}- You and your fucking rules!|- Knock it off!
{106319}{106401}Nobody's going to get hurt here.|Go home.
{106427}{106551}That's a hell of a good idea, Coach.|ln fact, l quit.
{106555}{106623}Guys, let's go. Pack it up.
{106627}{106729}- Let's go, guys.|- Guys, let's get out.

{106798}{106888}- l did what l had to do.|- lt's my team, too.
{106892}{107018}You de-ball them in front|of everyone. You are wrong!
{107388}{107469}- How about a lift?|- Where you headed?
{107473}{107545}Anywhere but here. Let's go.
{107549}{107649}Suit yourself.|You're on your own getting back.
{108284}{108352}l hate that station. My dad owns it.
{108356}{108468}l never want to see another building|with his name on it.
{108472}{108579}- Too bad you got mid-terms.|- No, l don't.
{108603}{108703}What'll my dad do|when someone flunks me?
{108707}{108783}What? You've been keeping up OK.
{108787}{108887}Two cheerleaders do my homework,|but l got to take the test.
{108891}{108985}When he finds out l didn't pass,|he'll buy me a grade.
{108989}{109066}You know what that could do|to the team.
{109070}{109210}lf you're sick of him covering,|that's fine. Work harder, that's all!
{109214}{109273}You can't just walk away.
{109287}{109351}Well, you did.
{109424}{109497}How'd l wind up with Jiminy Cricket?
{109501}{109612}Hey, Paul, what are you doing?|l can't go back there.
{109616}{109701}Relax. Maybe we'll both|learn something.
{109824}{109909}l've never passed anything|on my own before.
{109913}{110007}lt's about time you saw|the inside of the library!
{110011}{110084}- Meet your new tutor.|- Andre?
{110088}{110214}Relax, l have programmes|to accelerate your learning,
{110218}{110294}by linking mnemonic memory aids|with visual cues.
{110298}{110420}- l don't know what to say.|- Say goodbye to the daylight!
{110500}{110608}Just keep thinking,|''The ball is my friend.''
{110928}{111057}Edison's studying with Andre.|We'll have to practise without him.
{111117}{111226}- Not worried about Saturday?|- lf he doesn't pass, he's out.
{111230}{111327}The rest of the team|will back him up.
{111331}{111431}We pull together,|Saturday'll take care of itself.
{111493}{111585}Take them out. lt's your team, son.

{113342}{113397}What are you talking about?
{113401}{113488}Decide how serious|your commitment to academics is.
{113492}{113612}Your emotions may allow you to give|the players grades they didn't earn.
{113616}{113750}l'll regrade them objectively, and|when l'm finished, they're finished!
{113754}{113828}Fine, Phillip. Take the exams.
{113832}{113976}lf you change even one grade,|you can face an academic review!
{113980}{114053}Don't cross me, Suzanne.
{114057}{114122}Up yours, Phil!
{114174}{114229}She called me Phil.

{116918}{117005}l never lost a game in high school.
{117009}{117059}Not one.
{117100}{117150}lt was a great feeling.

{117253}{117317}l still dream about it.
{117364}{117471}l'd love to give those guys|that feeling just once.
{117475}{117619}They work so hard,|they don't deserve to go out losers.
{117623}{117703}You remember what you wrote|about that game,
{117707}{117816}how Gennero won|'cause his team played.
{117820}{117980}You've built something great|with these kids. They'd die for you.

{125242}{125323}- Come on!|- He's across the fieId.
{125327}{125450}- Where's the flag?|- He's going. One man Ieft to beat.
{125484}{125599}He's in the end zone.|I'm waiting for a fIag.
{125603}{125744}There's no fIag. There shouId be.|That puts the CoIts ahead 7 - 0.
{125748}{125876}A 96-yard touchdown couId give|them a faIse sense of confidence
{125880}{125955}going into the second minute of pIay.
{126010}{126080}Front left! Front left!
{126084}{126225}- Hit somebody there!|- l'm gonna rip your head off... !

{126657}{126739}Number 55! Throw a block at him!
{126743}{126875}- l'll run over your ass, fat boy!|- Three, 25! Set!
{126925}{127080}That's the fourth sack on BIake,|and the CoIt fans are eating it up!
{127084}{127155}Sit down. Keep a lid on it!
{127213}{127275}l'm gonna kill you! You're mine!
{127279}{127320}Set!
{127324}{127376}Hut! Hut!
{127499}{127602}Flat-top's making this|a personal grudge against Blake.
{127606}{127711}- We got him next time.|- No sweat. On the next one.
{127893}{127927}Oh, God!
{127931}{127988}How about a flag on that?
{127992}{128088}- Was it Flat-top again?|- Yeah.
{128092}{128179}We ought to block him|some time tonight, huh?
{128228}{128306}- Where are you going?|- None of your business.
{128310}{128378}Back to the seats!
{128382}{128473}You've made a serious|career mistake, my friend!
{128715}{128850}Oh, what a disappointment!|Third touchdown for the CoIts.
{129051}{129105}That makes it 2 1 - 0.
{129109}{129213}The ArmadiIIos are traiIing|by onIy three touchdowns.
{129217}{129334}ln the half-time extravaganza,|the marching band plays a tribute
{129338}{129424}to gun racks and open beverages,|legal only in Texas.
{129516}{129597}All right, guys, gather round.
{129691}{129790}So...we're losing 21 - 0.
{129834}{129942}But l think we got a shot|at beating this team.
{129946}{130030}lf, like Coach Gennero said,
{130034}{130133}we develop a cohesive|offensive strategy.
{130137}{130197}Popke, my notes.
{130247}{130327}- What's the coverage?|- A double-double.
{130331}{130420}Double-double...it doesn't matter.|McKenzie?
{130424}{130525}You're cutting off your outside|route. Cut inside for the dump-off.
{130529}{130589}And linemen, come on!
{130593}{130740}You've got to give Blake four seconds|to throw the goddamned ball!
{130744}{130883}Now, let's analyse|what's been working for us.
{130960}{131076}Not a goddamned thing's been|working for us! Like this suit!
{131080}{131184}And this stinking tie!|lt doesn't work for me!
{131188}{131265}You know how to play|winning football?
{131269}{131390}You play like Ed Gennero played!|He gave his life for this team!
{131394}{131494}He was a 1 40-pound halfback|and played like a wild man!
{131498}{131586}No! Like a goddamned|rampaging beast!
{131590}{131743}So you go out and tear their fucking|heads off and shit down their necks!
{131747}{131810}Let us pray!
{132021}{132146}The ArmadiIIos are moving|the baII this haIf. 4th down, punt.
{132150}{132229}McKenzie is deep to kick the baII.
{132233}{132267}Set!
{132320}{132451}A fake punt! BIake throws a bIock,|setting Edison free.
{132455}{132542}He's got a waII of bIockers now!
{132546}{132638}- He's going aII the way!|- Go, go, go!
{132662}{132710}Touchdown!
{132714}{132768}He's in for six!
{132772}{132806}All right!

{133043}{133161}Way to go!|Lucy? Get in there, kick that ball.
{133165}{133295}The press booth is going nuts|as Lucy kicks the extra point.
{133332}{133417}We're within three touchdowns|of taking the Iead...
{133421}{133500}What is it, Doc? ls it bad?
{133504}{133555}Hiatal hernia.
{133559}{133646}A rupture in the diaphragm|puts pressure on the pulmonary cavity,
{133650}{133702}causing angina.
{133706}{133815}- ls it fatal?|- lndigestion? Only in Mexico.
{133819}{133879}A passing situation for the CoIts.
{133949}{134025}Big sack by Manumana the SIender,
{134029}{134140}who does his ''I'm gonna get|some poi'' ceIebration dance!
{134157}{134303}The 'DiIIos get the baII with|four minutes Ieft in the third quarter.
{134312}{134404}- Brown right...|- Wait, they've seen the game films.
{134408}{134560}They know you'll never go to me,|and l'm wide open. l'll catch it.
{134626}{134746}- Big play! Let's go!|- Make it work! Make it work!
{134782}{134879}The ball is my friend.|The ball is my friend.
{134958}{135068}- Featherstone's off to the races!|- Not to Stonehands!
{135072}{135174}He's wide open,|but that's nothing new!
{135220}{135296}Can he catch the baII?
{135423}{135482}He caught it! Oh, my God!
{135486}{135577}Featherstone caught the baII!|It's a touchdown!
{135581}{135644}It's 2 1 - 1 3.
