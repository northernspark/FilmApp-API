(MAC AND KELLY MOANING)

3
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,895
MAC: Okay, it's happening.
It's spontaneous.

4
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,455
This... Who saw this coming?
I did not see this coming.

5
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,775
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, let's do it.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,295
Okay. It's happening.
It's totally happening.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,455
BOTH: Whoo!

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,655
What a twist.
Oh, yeah. Okay.

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,455
This is so spontaneous.

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,655
We're having sex one minute...

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,135
Who knows what's
gonna happen next?

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,735
Who knows what we'll be
doing in 10 minutes?

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,808
Okay.
This is crazy!

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,975
We're doing this on
the dining room...

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,764
I've never had sex on a dining
room chair in my whole life.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,335
(MOANING) This is amazing.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,615
I'm taking you to
Boner Town, bitch.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,615
Don't call me "bitch!"
Okay. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,007
I'm taking you to
Boner Town, love. Okay.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,969
(CONTINUES MOANING)

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,562
Baby? Baby?

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,335
She's totally
fucking looking at us.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,575
Hey, baby.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,735
She knows what's happening.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,815
She totally knows
what's happening.

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,815
(LAUGHS) She can't see anything.
She just sees shapes.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,735
She sees shapes fucking each other,
is what she sees. She can...

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,615
She's fine.
She just sees shapes.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,695
It's like bouncing balls.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,295
My bouncing balls.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,935
She's fine. She's fine.
You know what?

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,455
Let me turn her around.
Let me turn her around.

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,575
Okay. Okay.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,815
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, little girl.

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,535
Gonna turn around now.
Gonna look at the wall now.

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,655
Let's go.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,160
Okay. There you go.
Love you, sweetie. Okay.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,175
Okay! Let's do it.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,201
We're back.
We're back in business.

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,375
Okay. Okay.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,722
We are back.
It's happening. Okay.

42
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,135
(BOTH MOANING)

43
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,695
MAC: Oh, God. She keeps
turning... Turn around.

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,055
Just look that way.
Just turn around.

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,175
Why is she... Okay.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,655
I think it's over.

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,735
We still did that.

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,575
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay. We still did that.

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,535
Hello.

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,607
What are you doing
in your Jumperoo?

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,855
This never happened.

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,695
We're gonna finish that.
We will finish that.

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,535
FYI, we're gonna
do it in every room.

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,535
And this time,
I'm going to ejaculate.

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,210
Just because we have
a house and a baby

56
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,845
doesn't mean that
we're old people.

57
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,375
No. Fuck old people.

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,055
Old people don't
fuck like we just did.

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,695
Baby, I nearly came.

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,215
This is like <i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,455
I know! What's
nice about the house

62
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,535
is that it looks like every
penny we have is inside of it.

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,891
So, at least it looks like it.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,375
It's legitimate, right?

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,925
Neighbors. Hey.
Hi.

66
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,575
Hey.
Oh. Gay couple.

67
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,329
There's a gay couple.
Gay couple.

68
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,329
They seem like a nice couple.
They're so happy.

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,935
That's awesome!
Dream!

70
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,775
It is. Well,
it's the second dream.

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,055
First dream, Taco Bell opens next door.
That would be fucking dope.

72
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,735
Hi!
Hi!

73
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,331
Hey. It's a fabulous
neighborhood.

74

(STELLA CRYING
ON BABY MONITOR)

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,375
Oh, she's awake.
Really?

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,135
She's awake.
Okay.

77
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,295
Okay.
Uh... Well, bye.

78
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,367
Okay. Bye. Love you.

79
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,535
Love you. Bye.
Have a good day.

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,615
Can I come?

81
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,721
(LAUGHS) Kidding.

82
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,280
No, we'll have a great day! We'll
have a great day. Okay. Bye!

83
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,801
I love you!

84

BILL: Uh-oh. Mac attack.

85
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,121
MAC: Hey!

86
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,295
Hey, there he is.

87
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,415
Hey.

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,655
I need that
Mendelson file by 4:00.

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,935
Okay, yeah.

90
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,255
And this is not your Bro, this
is your boss talking. (CHUCKLES)

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,855
I'll have it to you
by 3:30. How's that?

92
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,415
Mac!
Okay.

93
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,441
Mac!

94
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,615
What?

95
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,971
Wait. Hold on.

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,606
Whoo!

97
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,807
Okay!

98
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,295
(PANTING) Oh, jeez, it's so far.

99
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,882
Hey, we gotta go work on that
thing we were discussing.

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,055
What thing?
What's going on?

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,163
We have to go work
on that joint file.

102
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,735
Of course. The joint file.

103
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,175
You guys are doing a joint file?

104
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,295
We have a joint file together.

105
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,935
JIMMY: Yeah. We're pretty
deep into it. It's tight.

106
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,815
It's pretty thick.
It's a big file.

107
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,649
Pretty fat file.
It's dank.

108
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,975
We should blaze through
it, probably. Yeah.

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,295
Yeah, we gotta file that
for the THC Corporation.

110
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,685
Okay.

111
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,131
Because we are in the weeds.

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,975
How's Stella?
She's a cute baby.

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,015
It's nice.

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,615
I think I realized for the first
six months, everything is fucked.

115
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,055
Everything changes completely.
Yeah.

116
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,775
You're like, "My life is over!
Everything's different!"

117
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,375
"Everything I could do,
I can't do anymore."

118
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,335
But now, I realize that that's
all gonna go back to normal.

119
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,335
You sure about that?
She can start drinking soon.

120
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,135
They make these little strips that
test your tit milk for alcohol.

121
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,495
She puts them on her tits?

122
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,615
Yeah, she puts them on her tits.
Her tits are huge right now.

123
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,135
Are they really?
But I can't touch them.

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,055
She won't even let me see
them, is what's fucked up.

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,135
What?
When we have sex,

126
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,655
she leaves a wife-beater on.

127
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,455
It's like having sex
with Tony Soprano.

128
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,535
You're the <i>goomah</i>
in this situation.

129
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,561
Yeah, it's fucked up.

130
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,855
You are the only one of our friends
that has a house and a kid.

131
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,935
Yeah.

132
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,255
It's like you're, like, 10 years
older than everyone, you know?

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,327
You're divorced.

134
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,481
The point is...

135
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,935
It's Jimmy time.
You know what I mean?

136
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,575
And the girls,
when you're dating...

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,015
Yeah?
Holy shit!

138
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,883
See, we missed out
on the whole, kind of,

139
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,895
sex-Tech bubble,
you know what I mean?

140
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,695
Now they got Sex Book
and Fuck Friends and...

141
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,535
There's this thing called
Grindr, which is just...

142
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,015
Your phone beeps when there's
someone horny near you.

143
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,495
It's kind of amazing.

144
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,966
It's mostly guys, but I'm gonna
find a girl pretty soon.

145
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,695
JIMMY: You're up.

146
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,881
Oh, oh! Oh!

147
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,041
Hey.

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
What are you guys
doing out here?

149
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,335
There are the girls.
KELLY: Hi.

150
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,215
How's it going, sweetie?
Good.

151
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,446
What's happening?

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,135
There you go.

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,935
She's excited to see you.

154
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,895
Wait, wait. Hey.

155

(BABBLES)

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,495
Man, parenting is easy.
Look at that!

157
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,895
Yeah, two hours a day.

158
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,921
Yeah.

159
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,255
This is delightful. This
is awesome, this thing.

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,095
We should get one of

Could've been anyone.

635
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,935
Could have been anyone. Any one of
these people could have called.

636
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,415
We're not gonna
get caught for this.

637
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,444
Anyone would do this.
This isn't because we're old.

638
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,535
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh!

639
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,975
Oh, shit!
Oh, no!

640
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,295
MAC: Oh, no! Oh, fuck!

641
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,455
KELLY: Oh, no.

642
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,135
He sold us out.

643
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,495
Fuck, they're coming up the driveway.
Oh, shit, they're coming.

644
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,522
Oh, shit. They're right there.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

645
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,135
MAC: Just go, you answer it.
KELLY: You answer it.

646
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,095
You answer!
You are gonna answer.

647
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,122
You do it.
You do it. You do it.

648
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,775
We're just getting dressed!
I'm naked!

649
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,575
No, I see you guys right there.
One moment.

650
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,045
Act like you just woke up.

651
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,328
(BOTH YAWNING)

652
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,006
Hey.

653
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,326
WATKINS: Hello, are you Mac?

654
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,683
Yeah. What's happening?

655
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,450
You called about your neighbors?

656
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,320
No.

657
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,927
No.

658
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,175
I have a call, it's from Mac Radner.
That's you. Right?

659
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,335
Yeah. How do you
have that information?

660
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,681
We have caller ID.
We're cops.

661
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,642
Everybody has caller ID.
You're Mac Radner.

662
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,895
Okay, yes.

663
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,935
You called us.
Why did you call us?

664
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,203
I called the cops because
you were being noisy, man.

665
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,015
And I tried to get you to
stop, and you wouldn't stop.

666
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,175
They won't stop partying!

667
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,295
Officer, you know how it is.

668
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,375
We're just trying
to get to sleep.

669
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,855
We have a little baby.
We have a baby.

670
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,689
Mac's working in the morning.
We got jobs.

671
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,524
They were at the party
with us just last night.

672
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,569
Did you party with this kid?
We don't party with them!

673
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,735
We shouldn't be in trouble. We
haven't done anything wrong.

674
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,855
We have a baby.
We're parents.

675
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,484
Well then,
what do you call these?

676
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,249
<i>I'm too fucked up!
Ahhh! Ahhh!</i>

677
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,409
WATKINS: Well, it looks like you
guys were partying with him.

678
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,721
You party pretty heavy.

679
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,175
That's a joke photo!

680
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,375
It's a joke?
That's a joke!

681
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,655
It's not a good joke.

682
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,975
Okay, you know what?
Let's end this.

683
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,015
I'm sorry.
I rescind the complaint.

684
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,135
You can go.
No noise complaint.

685
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,844
You know the boy who cried wolf?

686
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,375
You're that boy.

687
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,535
Okay, I cried wolf.
Never call us again.

688
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,608
Never call you again?
You're the fucking police.

689
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,575
Look, man, we're sorry.

690
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,735
You were being noisy.

691
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,295
We tried to call you.
I don't know what to say.

692
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,055
We called you five times,
you didn't answer us.

693
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,735
You made a promise
to me last night.

694
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,135
We were pissing.
We crossed streams.

695
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,735
Don't worry about it, you know?

696
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,127
"Hey, I'm Batman."
You know? Right?

697
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,535
No, we're done with that, Bro.

698
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,335
We're still cool, man. We're still cool.
We're sorry.

699
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,175
I'm not mad.

700
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,123
I'm just disappointed.

701
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,248
Hey, come on.
Wait, let's just...

702
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,801
MAC: What's that?

703
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,641
Those are for you.

704
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,246
What the fuck?

705
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,920
Oh.

706
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,615
TEDDY: You shouldn't have
called the cops, Bro!

707
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,926
Okay.

708
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,695
(ALL SHOUTING) Okay, very good.

709
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,775
Very good.

710
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,535
KELLY: Okay.
Congratulations.

711
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,135
You better put that
in the recycling bin.

712
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,161
All of it.
All of it.

713
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,484
PETE: It's like Edward Scissorhands.
Do you like it?

714
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,130
It's a really expensive bush!

715
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,561
I'm sorry, I felt inspiration.
What was I supposed to do?

716
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,643
I'm about to rip this
shit out of the ground.

717
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,215
(GRUNTING)

718
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,765
Fuck this bush!
Fuck that bush, man!

719
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,410
Fuck this bush!
Fuck that bush!

720
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,688
Harder, man. Yeah,
really get in there.

721
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,171
Oh! Oh!
God damn it! Kelly!

722
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,005
Whoa. Hey, man,
buy him dinner first.

723
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,121
Fuck this bush!

724
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,655
(GROANS)

725
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,727
ALL: Oh!
Shit!

726
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,415
Okay. Ha-ha.

727
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,363
Sorry, man. Sorry my ball
just got in your face.

728
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,366
(BOTH MOANING)

729
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,163
I love you.
Baby.

730
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,006
Oh, God.

731
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,605
I can't believe
this is happening.

732
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,055
It's finally happening.

733
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,366
(ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY)

734
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,289
What the fuck?
Oh, my God!

735
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,090
Oh, no! Oh, no!

736
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,175
We can't be the only people
in the neighborhood

737
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,335
who are sick of
this bullshit, you know.

738
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,800
We've gotta get
everyone on our side.

739
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,175
We could lead a revolution.

740
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,201
Oh, no.

741
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,295
They're buying off the whole
neighborhood with their slave army.

742
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,483
Oh! Mrs. Haywood,
you're better than that.

743
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,290
I can't sell your house.

744
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,527
Why?
Well,

745
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,722
because the only
people who would want

746
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,842
to live next to a frat
house is a frat house.

747
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,935
Oh, the university
might be interested.

748
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,855
I know the Spanish department
is looking for a new building.

749
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,615
Only thing, if you
sell to the university,

750
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,086
I'd say, optimistically,
you're looking

751
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,726
at losing about
half your investment.

752
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,375
MAC: Half of all of our...

753
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,895
We put all of our money in.
This is all of our money.

754
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,055
We can't lose half.

755
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,535
But you keep half.

756
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,215
We don't need that!
What is that?

757
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,455
Sold!

758
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,215
And you keep making
money no matter what!

759
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,890
Real estate is a fickle bitch.

760
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,295
Okay, maybe it's
best you just go.

761
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,695
Thank you for coming.
Okay.

762
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,801
That was not helpful.

763
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,206
Well, okay.

764
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,325
What are you wearing?
What is this?

765
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,970
What are you doing?
Yeah.

766
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,770
We're throwing
a Robert De Niro party.

767
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,328
Should be pretty fucking loud.

768
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,847
It's probably gonna go
pretty fucking late, too.

769
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,361
I'm <i>Taxi Driver</i> De Niro.

770
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,244
Yeah, I'm <i>Meet the Fockers</i>
De Niro.

771
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,641
I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.

772
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,644
Who painted that mole on your face?
Did you do that yourself?

773
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,848
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did, Focker.

774
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,001
Who are you?

775
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,364
Oh, I'm Sam Jackson, you know,
from Jackie Brown.

776
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,086
Hoo-ah!

777
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,406
ALL: Hoo-ah!

778
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,175
That's AI Pacino.
That's not even... Yeah.

779
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,247
<i>Scent of a Woman.</i>

780
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
ALL: Hoo-ah!

781
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,720
There's no consistency here.

782
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,484
You're all over the place
with your references.

783
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,775
You're upsetting Jinxy cat.

784
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,246
Just stop doing this
stupid shit! We're sorry.

785
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,880
Hey, when you called the cops, you
violated the circle of trust, Focker.

786
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,042
We're sorry we
called the cops, okay?

787
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,401
Are you talking to me?

788
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,607
MAC: Yes.
KELLY: Yes.

789
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,815
Are you talking to me?

790
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,935
Yes!
Yes!

791
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,095
No, you talking to me.

792
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,455
Are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

793
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,775
I don't see anyone else here.

794
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,926
I don't see anyone
else here, either!

795
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,215
We're trying to talk to you.

796
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,655
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides..."

797
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,695
What the fuck are you doing? That's
the wrong Sam Jackson speech!

798
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,615
Are you talking to me,
or are you talking to him?

799
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,735
(OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS)

800
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,735
Just get off!
Are you talking to me?

801
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,895
Shut the fuck up!

802
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,975
You get the fuck out of here.

803
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,001
Stop it!

804
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,481
Hey. What's nice
is in a few years,

805
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,887
we'll have a third
person to help us do this.

806
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,081
Hey.

807
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,329
What do you got there, sweetie?

808
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,526
Is that a balloon?

809
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,491
Did you find a balloon?

810
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,569
Oh, shit! That's
not a balloon!

811
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,046
Oh, Jesus!
(SCREAMS)

812
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,730
Oh, God! Oh, no!

813
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,211
Help! Help!

814
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,408
Get the fuck...
Get out of my way! Move!

815
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,409
Doctor! Doctor!
Oh, God!

816
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,685
All right.
Hey.

817
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,364
Your baby

818
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,290
has HIV.

819
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,526
(GASPS) Oh, my God.

820
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,603
Is how bad this could have gone.

821
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,686
The condom was unused.

822
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,135
(MURMURING) Are you fucking
kidding me?

823
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,084
Who the fuck says that
to a couple of parents?

824
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,687
Hey! Ma'am!

825
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,921
Chill out, Chill out!

826
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,366
They are dangerous
to the neighborhood!

827
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,895
There's a clear
focus going on here.

828
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,335
I heard they burned
down their last house.

829
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,203
And they were
reprimanded for that.

830
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,489
We have a very strict three-strike
policy at this school.

831
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,490
So, they have one strike. If they
get two more, then they're out.

832
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,815
A strike?

833
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,815
Well, listen,
the way I do my job is,

834
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,335
you know, I'm always thinking
about the headlines, right?

835
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,215
So, "Duke Lacrosse Team Rapes
Stripper." Bad headline.

836
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,969
"Fraternity Keeps Couple Awake"?

837
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,168
That's not really
even a headline.

838
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,408
I don't even think it would
make the local police blotter.

839
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,403
Get ready to read
the headline of the century.

840
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,564
Extra, extra!
"Baby Swallows Condom!"

841
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,370
That's disgusting!
Exactly!

842
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,925
It's the frat's condom!
That's the frat's condom!

843
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,645
I have a headline for this.

844
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,007
"Fraternity
Practices Safe Sex."

845
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,401
That's a good headline. I could
get a raise off that headline.

846
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,971
I got a headline for you.

847
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,331
"Mean Dean Doesn't Realize That
Frat Is Bad For Everyone."

848
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,527
It's really not.

849
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,095
It's very poorly worded. I don't think
that would ever make it to print.

850
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,281
I don't know where
you went to school.

851
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,807
I went here, okay?
That's why I'm dumb!

852
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,042
You know what? I just thought
of another headline.

853
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,403
"Negligent Parents
Allow Baby to Swallow Condom."

854
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,004
What'd you say?
It's not a good headline.

855
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,961
Here's a headline. How
about, "Go Fuck Yourself"?

856
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,121
That's what you get.

857
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,535
This is our home!
It's our home!

858
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,895
This is our little cub on our
lawn with a condom in her mouth.

859
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,763
Oh, my God.
I'm a mama bear.

860
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,000
Yes, you are.
You know what?

861
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,015
I'm gonna act all
docile and then...

862
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,495
(BOTH ROARING)

863
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,602
My claws are out!
I'm gonna fucking get them!

864
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,531
(HISSING)
Fuck these fucking guys!

865
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,335
They don't know who
they are fucking with.

866
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,124
They think I'm
just a regular dad

867
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,055
and then you know what happens?

868
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,415
Boom! Boom!

869
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,647
Teddy's dead!
Pete's dead! Scoonie's dead!

870
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,121
Fuck you!
No, no.

871
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,645
I'll fucking kill them!
No, no.

872
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,290
Boom!
No.

873
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,925
I'm buying a fucking gun!
No, you're not!

874
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,242
I'm not buying a gun!
You're right, it's a bad idea.

875
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,495
Bad call.

876
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,655
What about one of those
small prostitute guns?

877
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,125
No. You're not buying a gun.

878
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,646
(EXHALES) Fuck!

879
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,095
What can we do?
That fucking Dean.

880
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,202
What woman is named "Dean"?

881
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,164
She's not named "Dean."
That's her job.

882
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,244
What?
That's what "dean" is here.

883
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,615
No.
Yeah.

884
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,135
Really?
What did you think?

885
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,535
I thought that was her name.
No.

886
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,641
Oh, no.

887
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,649
What do they call it in Australia?
"Chancellor."

888
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,325
No, she's the chancellor.

889
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,643
Oh, my God.
I was so rude to her.

890
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,649
I don't know what to do.
What do we know?

891
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,135
What didn't we have in college?

892
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,685
I didn't have any money.

893
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,921
I had no money either.
We had no money.

894
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,161
They're broke.
They don't have any money.

895
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,924
We fuck with their house.
They can't afford to fix it.

896
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,446
Yes.
They have to move.

897
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,846
Yeah, fuck them!
Fuck them!

898
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,081
We're gonna fucking fuck them!
Fuck them!

899
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,203
We are going to fuck them!
Fuck them!

900
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,681
(BOTH SCREAMING)

901
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,571
(ALL GROANING)

902
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,684
So the water came out of here?
Yep.

903
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,371
This is gonna ruin us.

904
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,335
I mean, the foundation is flooded.
We can't pay for this shit.

905
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,015
They're gonna condemn the house.

906
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,495
Okay, well, on that note,

907
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,045
maybe we should clean up and not

908
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,685
stand here with our
dicks in our hands.

909
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,964
"Dicks in our hands."

910
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,449
Dicks in our hands.

911
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,529
Dicks in our hands.

912
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,049
Dicks in our hands.

913
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,362
Dicks in our hands.

914
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,086
Teddy, how much time we got?

915
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,403
Just a couple minutes, and
then we pour in the latex.

916
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,642
We've got Delta Psi dildos
we can merchandise.

917
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,282
Oh, God, I can't keep
my boner much longer.

918
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,335
We're supposed to have boners?

919
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,044
Yeah.
Nobody wants a limp dildo.

920
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,007
You don't know that. People
could want it for after.

921
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,562
Like, for cuddling,
and it's like a love...

922
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,410
Okay, you're right.
It's just a limp dick.

923
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,251
Hey, you boys
have to go digital.

924
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,925
Look at that
3-D printer go.

925
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,041
Look at it go!

926
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,286
That's awesome.

927
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,601
ELECTRONIC VOICE: <i>Penis completed.</i>

928
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,415
Now I can go to class
while my dick prints.

929
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,441
Where did you get that?

930
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,085
Got it at my architecture lab.
Pretty cool, right?

931
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,655
Wow. Man, you should
go to class sometime.

932
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,015
We have excellent facilities
that, like, no one uses.

933
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,042
All right, let's pull these bad
boys off and see what we've got.

934
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,255
We're good?
Yeah.

935
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,361
GARF: Let's do it.

936
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,495
This is like Christmas.
Oh!

937
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,601
Wow.
Whoa.

938
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,695
Hey, you know, I think the
clay is stuck to my pubes.

939
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,085
Why do you have pubes?

940
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,935
Wait. You guys shaved?

941
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,644
Dude, I texted you.
I said, "Shave."

942
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,895
I thought we were taking pictures.
I cleaned up a little, but...

943
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,967
Not your face.

944
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,641
Oh, God.

945
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,881
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

946
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,280
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

947
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,575

00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,801
<i>I kind of miss the rush
of messing with the frat.</i>

1421
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,525
I have to go. She's awake.

1422
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,489
<i>Okay, call me after.
Call me soon.</i>

1423
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,165
TEDDY: Hey, neighbor.

1424
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,255
Ooh!

1425
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,406
(ALL LAUGHING)

1426
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,367
Okay. Are you ready?

1427
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,090
Me and Kelly,
we have found a way

1428
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,850
to give the frat
their last strike.

1429
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,570
Get them out of here forever!
Out!

1430
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,215
Why are we doing this? Didn't
we already win? Remember?

1431
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,575
"Bros before hos," that whole thing?
It's over!

1432
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,695
They're still fucking there!
There's beer cans on the lawn.

1433
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,775
They're barbecuing.

1434
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,975
So?
"So?"

1435
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,206
It smells delicious in here.

1436
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,975
Try living next to it.
Try living next to it!

1437
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,570
Hey, you guys don't
want to go back to your

1438
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,295
boring ass lives as parents.
That's what it is.

1439
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,295
I'm surprised and
shocked, honestly,

1440
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,924
that it is so hard
to convince you,

1441
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,655
of all people,
that this is a good idea.

1442
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,727
What?

1443
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,771
One of those childs is
having sex with your wife.

1444
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,008
It's fine. We're divorced.

1445
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,015
Jimmy! Wake up!
Wake up, man.

1446
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,175
His dick is this big!

1447
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,335
"Hey, homie. I'm gonna fuck
your wife with my giant dick."

1448
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,725
"Oh, my God,
this is amazing."

1449
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,295
"Oh, my God, homie.
It feels so good."

1450
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,575
"Oh, homie."
"Wow. Oh, my God."

1451
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,215
"It feels so good, homie."
"What are you doing later?"

1452
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,287
"Oh, homie, let's do it.
Oh, God, homie."

1453
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,495
"That's amazing."

1454
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,775
Okay, enough! Stop imitating!

1455
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,768
I get it!
He's got a huge dick!

1456
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,007
And her vagina, "Bye!"
It's ruined!

1457
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,255
MAC: Destroyed. Gone!

1458
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,015
It's like when you lend
a fat friend your shirt,

1459
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,407
and it comes back, and it's
all stretchy and flappy!

1460
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,565
Sagging all over the place!
It'll be like this.

1461
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,046
I'm in!
MAC: Yes!

1462
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,215
Nice! Nice! Great!
Awesome, awesome!

1463
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,571
What's the plan?
Okay, okay.

1464
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,125
We've been thinking.
What gets frats

1465
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,840
kicked out of schools
more than anything?

1466
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,366
Rape!

1467
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,647
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1468
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,175
Hazing scandals.
Hazing scandals!

1469
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,215
Yes!
Hazing scandals!

1470
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,295
Hazing scandals!
Yes!

1471
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,175
You should've said it
before you let me answer.

1472
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,328
We need all that equipment
you bought to spy on Paula.

1473
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,211
I didn't...
(LAUGHS) What?

1474
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,406
Just stop.

1475
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,280
MAC: Look, you just take
these spy glasses.

1476
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,090
They look totally
like normal glasses.

1477
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,695
You wear them
into the frat house.

1478
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,255
Teddy's gonna start
pushing you around

1479
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,735
and fucking with you,
like he always does.

1480
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,415
Like I've seen him
do a million times.

1481
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,895
At that moment,
you just push back.

1482
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,855
Okay? Just push back.

1483
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,535
The rest will
take care of itself.

1484
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,085
He'll haze
the fucking shit out of you.

1485
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,690
It'll all get
caught on this camera.

1486
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,042
Delta Psi is gone,
you're a free man.

1487
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,975
Those guys are my brothers.

1488
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,095
KELLY: Your brothers?

1489
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,135
Do you think your brothers would
really treat you like that?

1490
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,241
Think about what
they've done to you.

1491
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,646
They dehumanized you.

1492
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,643
They treated you like shit.
They degraded you.

1493
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,325
JIMMY: You're an animal.
They called you Assjuice.

1494
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,441
Assjuice.

1495
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,055
KELLY: Assjuice.
MAC: Assjuice.

1496
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,815
JIMMY: Subhuman.
KELLY: Assjuice.

1497
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,604
ALL: Assjuice. Assjuice.

1498
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,728
Assjuice. Assjuice.

1499
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,123
Assjuice! Assjuice!
Assjuice! Assjuice!

1500
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,408
You better eat this
fucking dog food, now!

1501
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,927
(SCREAMING)

1502
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,001
PETE: What's the lesson?

1503
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,249
BOYS: Don't go to sleep!

1504
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,364
This is your destiny, Assjuice.

1505
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,401
Assjuice!

1506
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,761
ALL: (CHANTING)
Assjuice! Assjuice! Assjuice!

1507
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,530
<i>Assjuice! Assjuice!</i>

1508
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,655
I don't know.

1509
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,800
JIMMY: Everyone breaks, Bro.

1510
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,126
Biology.

1511
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,611
That's from <i>Zero Dark Thirty.</i>

1512
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,170
You guys don't get it.

1513
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,444
I've gone through hell.

1514
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,444
I'm not gonna throw
that all away now.

1515
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,127
You know how many BJs
I've been promised?

1516
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,880
Infinite BJs.

1517
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,368
Infinite. Infinite.

1518
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,210
Infinite BJs.

1519
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,010
Delta Psi forever, ya bish.

1520
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,522
We'll give you $1,000.

1521
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,285
Okay. I'm in.

1522
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,726
Nice!

1523
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,015
Nice! That was good!
JIMMY: That was good. That was really good.

1524
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,530
That was good.
That was sexy, too.

1525
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,925
He looks like J.J. Abrams.

1526
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,846
MAC: You look good. It looks okay.
I think it's okay.

1527
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,001
You're never gonna forget this!

1528
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,004
<i>Move, elephants!
Move! Keep marching.</i>

1529
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,844
March!

1530
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,689
<i>March, march, march, elephants.</i>

1531
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,086
I'm not doing this anymore.

1532
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,255
Get back in line, Assjuice!

1533
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,281
<i>Get back in line!</i>

1534
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,409
Fuck you.
I am not an elephant!

1535
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,735
<i>What did you just say to me?</i>

1536
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,046
<i>I am not an elephant!</i>

1537
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,560
He's doing it.
He's doing it.

1538
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,405
<i>I'm a human man!
I have dignity!</i>

1539
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,403
<i>We all have dignity!</i>
Yes, Assjuice, yes!

1540
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,281
<i>Our names are not Fuckhead,
or Jizzface, or Lea Michele.</i>

1541
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,720
Lea Michele from Glee?
That's actually funny.

1542
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,880
Yeah, that's really funny.

1543
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,167
It's Evan.

1544
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,731
And Brendan.

1545
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,401
And Juan.

1546
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,449
<i>So, fuck you.</i>

1547
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,250
<i>Haze me. Say it.</i>

1548
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,050
Say it! Come on!
Say it, Teddy.

1549
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,846
<i>I will haze you until your
fucking face falls off!</i>

1550
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,923
ALL: Yeah!

1551
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,450
That's great. Okay, okay.
We did it.

1552
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,095
<i>You're in so much fucking trouble.
Come with me, pledge.</i>

1553
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,121
ASSJUICE: <i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1554
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,606
Fuck him up, Teddy.

1555
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,448
I'm sorry.
I'll do anything.

1556
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,841
What's going on, Gary?

1557
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,042
<i>Are you okay, man?
You seem distraught.</i>

1558
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,895
"You seem distraught"?

1559
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,255
<i>I mean, you've always been, in my
opinion, like, our strongest pledge,</i>

1560
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,575
<i>and now you're talking back.</i>

1561
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,886
ASSJUICE: <i>I'm scared.
You're scared?</i>

1562
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,215
<i>I'm fucking scared, man.
I'm tired all the time.</i>

1563
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,415
<i>Fucking tired.
I miss my mom.</i>

1564
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,255
Oh, no, Assjuice.
<i>Breaking? The guy was right.</i>

1565
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,295
<i>Everybody breaks.</i>

1566
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,775
<i>Okay. I'll tell you what.</i>

1567
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,375
<i>You go up to my room.</i>

1568
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,880
<i>Lock the door,
draw yourself a bath. Relax.</i>

1569
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,451
(GASPS) "Draw yourself a bath"?

1570
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,728
<i>Catch up on some Z's,
okay? Take a nap.</i>

1571
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,375
<i>Full season of Girls
up there in the DVR.</i>

1572
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,811
We never planned for nice.

1573
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,251
<i>Thanks for talking to me,
brother. All right?</i>

1574
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,001
You can always come to me with
this kind of stuff, all right?

1575
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,961
You're doing a great job.
See you upstairs.

1576
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,885
(BOTH IMITATING EXPLOSIONS)

1577
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,360
<i>I'm sorry, guys.
He's too good of a dude.</i>

1578
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,485
No!
<i>Teddy!</i>

1579
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,975
<i>What's up?
Yeah, one more thing.</i>

1580
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,001
No more thing!

1581
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,168
<i>These glasses,
there's a camera in them.</i>

1582
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,407
ALL: No!

1583
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,567
Oh, my God!

1584
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,886
The asset's gone rogue.

1585
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,055
Shit, he's still talking.

1586
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,135
ASSJUICE: <i>Your neighbors
got me to wear them,</i>

1587
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,455
<i>so they could
film you hazing us,</i>

1588
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,015
<i>so the fraternity
would get dissolved.</i>

1589
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,044
<i>And this isn't the first time. No, no,
no, no. They flooded the basement.</i>

1590
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,931
<i>They got Brother Pete to
hook up with Sister Brooke.</i>

1591
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,215
<i>I'm so sorry, man.</i>

1592
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,655
<i>It's okay.
They've been after us for weeks.</i>

1593
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,175
No!
He's telling him everything!

1594
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,804
Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ, guys!

1595
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,285
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1596
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,601
MAC: Wait.

1597
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,335
He's looking at us.

1598
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,203
What are you doing?
He's looking at us.

1599
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,924
<i>You guys just crossed
the fucking line. You're dead.</i>

1600
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,601
We're dead?

1601
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,135
(YELLS)

1602
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,175
Oh, God! Oh, my God!
That was scary.

1603
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,531
Come on, guys.
Jesus.

1604
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,689
<i>How do you turn these off?</i>

1605
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,365
ASSJUICE: <i>It's on the side.</i>

1606
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,885
(SINGING) <i>We're gonna
go to the shops</i>

1607
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,522
<i>Then we're gonna
go to Mommy and Me</i>

1608
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,042
<i>And see all those
bitches that I hate</i>

1609
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,886
<i>It's gonna be really boring</i>

1610
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,367
<i>But we'll get out of the house!</i>

1611
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,681
KELLY: <i>I think the frat has broken into
the car and stolen all of the airbags.</i>

1612
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,251
Airbags?
<i>Yeah.</i>

1613
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,084
That's so weird.
Is anything else missing?

1614
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,605
<i>No!</i>
Okay.

1615
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,805
<i>Why would they just break in
and steal the airbags?</i>

1616
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,760
I don't know. We should
file a police report...

1617
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,491
(GROANING)

1618
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,605
What the fuck?

1619
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,806
Oh, shit!

1620
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,171
Found the airbags!

1621
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,246
There's three left!

1622
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,801
Fuck!

1623
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,241
Two left!
(JIMMY GROANING)

1624
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,770
Jimmy, are you okay?

1625
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,601
I'm fine!

1626
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,604
It wasn't as bad as
it seemed. I'm fine.

1627
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,524
Delta Psi has the upper hand!

1628
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,406
We went too far now.
This is dangerous.

1629
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,615
We did not go too far.

1630
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,655
Now is when we get
them back even more.

1631
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,444
Do you see what they fucking did to me?
We don't stop now!

1632
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,807
So, what it's gonna be next? They're
gonna break into the house?

1633
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,015
No. No.

1634
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,691
You need to grow up, okay?
Our family is in danger.

1635
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,680
I need to grow up?
Yes, you need to grow up.

1636
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,975
One of us has got to be the
adult in this relationship.

1637
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,255
You should take responsibility.

1638
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,442
That's not only offensive,
but it's fucking stupid.

1639
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,449
It's offensive that I'm saying
that you should be smart?

1640
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,371
Yes, it's offensive that I have
to be the smart one all the time!

1641
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,975
I'm allowed to be
just as irresponsible as you.

1642
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,287
Well, that's how it works!
I'm the dumb guy,

1643
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,895
and you're the woman
who's supposed to

1644
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,415
stop the dumb guy
from doing dumb shit!

1645
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,575
Haven't you ever seen
a fucking Kevin James movie?

1646
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,815
We can't both be Kevin James.
I'm Kevin James!

1647
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,655
I have a little bit
of Kevin James in me.

1648
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,775
Well, we can't both...

1649
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,962
Clearly, you're the one who knows
better, so you should know better.

1650
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,295
You know that I'm not like that,
and I've never been like that.

1651
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,890
Well, maybe you should be.
That's never been me.

1652
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,411
Just because I'm
a mom doesn't mean

1653
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,055
that I'm gonna change who I am.

1654
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,295
Well, just because I'm a father,

1655
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,975
it doesn't mean I can stop doing
mushrooms with teenagers.

1656
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,001
Fine!
Fine!

1657
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,135
Good.
Good, then.

1658
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,003
Okay, Kevin, I don't think
we're a good team anymore.

1659
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,295
The team is breaking up.
Yep.

1660
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,209
This worked before
we had Stella, but...

1661
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,010
Now it doesn't.
It doesn't work anymore.

1662
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,400
Yeah, because
someone refuses to grow up.

1663
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,575
Fine. Okay.
Fine then.

1664
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,329
You go find your
nagging wife that you

1665
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,295
want to find,
and I'll go find a real man.

1666
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,855
Fine! Good to know.
Fine.

1667
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,201
I don't feel safe here,
just in case you didn't know.

1668
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,446
Well, that's crazy.

1669
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,695
I'm gonna take our child and go.

1670
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,055
Oh, yeah? Well,
that's ludicrous,

1671
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,050
because this is perhaps the
safest place on the planet,

1672
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,321
just so you know!

1673
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,975
You're kidnapping our baby!
Asshole!

1674
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,615
Don't kidnap our baby!

1675
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,369
I'm gonna put out
an AMBER fucking Alert!

1676
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,249
Enjoy the house by
yourself, you child!

1677
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,005
This is safer
than the White House!

1678
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,211
(GROANING)

1679
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,370
Dude, we missed the airbag!

1680
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,164
Kelly, there's one left!

1681
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,165
It could be anywhere!

1682
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,291
Ow!

1683
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,203
Hey, man, do you think, maybe we're
going, like, way too far with this?

1684
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,655
I mean, as a child
of divorce, I just...

1685
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,251
I can't help it,
I sympathize with them.

1686
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,563
Well, my parents love each other,
and I think it's hilarious.

1687
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,931
(SCREAMS)

1688
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,921
Fuck!

1689
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,921
Fuckers! Fuck!

1690
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,127
<i>Shalom,</i> Mac.

1691
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,615
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

1692
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,766
How's it going?
I'm sorry.

1693
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,455
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1694
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,606
I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.

1695
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,855
I love you, I'm sorry.

1696
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,255
I was so stupid.

1697
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,095
What a stupid
fucking fight to have.

1698
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,326
No, I was stupid.
I'm really, really sorry.

1699
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,775
I'm so sorry.
It was so dumb.

1700
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,455
It was really dumb.
I love you so much, okay?

1701
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,815
Do you still like me?
I miss you. I love you.

1702
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,966
Do you still like me?
Yes, I still like you.

1703
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,684
Okay, good. I love you.
Okay.

1704
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,600
She's so crazy.

1705
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,926
She's still behind you.

1706
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,009
Hey.
Hi.

1707
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,645
Lame, isn't it, Pete?

1708
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,880
Whoa.

1709
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,606
You're really
villaining out in here.

1710
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,169
What's lame?
What's going on?

1711
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,888
Lame that we're on probation.

1712
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,295
We're not gonna
end up on this thing.

1713
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,175
That is kind of lame, but also
kind of meaningless, right?

1714
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,615
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1715
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,975
No, man. I just mean, like,
you're the President, you know?

1716
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,095
If you want to be up there so
bad, just put your picture up.

1717
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,135
No one's gonna stop you.

1718
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,288
Because then I didn't earn it.

1719
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,175
It doesn't mean anything
if you don't earn it.

1720
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,645
Who cares?

1721
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,685
"Who cares?"

1722
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,884
Are you kidding me?

1723
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,529
You're the VP, man.

1724
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,655
We have wanted this
since we were freshmen.

four years ago, okay?

All right?

like, adults now.

is even gonna matter.

you're so obsessed

01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,535
with that old couple
next door, all right?

1745

remind you of the future.

Old people?

1881
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,324
Thumbsucker! Let me see the
letter from the school, man!

1882
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,455
Our school's
insignia is in Latin.

1883
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,095
This is in Jewish!

1884
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,775
What?
We're not off probation!

1885
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,006
The old people
have the upper hand.

1886
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,295
We got to get
everyone out of here!

1887
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,415
We got to get everybody...

1888

They're fucking hootie-hooing.

KELLY: What does that mean?

1894
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,495
That means they know
the cops are coming.

1895
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,249
I don't get it! MAC: It's
from an Outkast song.

1896
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,055
BOTH: (SINGING) <i>Born and
bred up on the street top</i>

spot And forever hollerin'</i>

<i>Yo, cops be robbing niggaz
blind With the dollars...</i>

1900
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,215
Okay, okay, we fucking get it!
I get it. I get it.

1901
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,855
That's the song. How could
they know that's happening?

1902
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,006
How do they know
something's wrong?

1903
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,175
It's because of the Hebrew.

1904
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,204
I put a little Hebrew in the school
sign, you know, like a coded game.

1905
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,655
What?
What?

1906
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,175
Check this out.
Inside the school seal,

1907
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,575
I put <i>sof hamisschak,</i> which
is Hebrew for "game over."

1908
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,251
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
Why did you do that?

1909

Stop hitting me.
MAC: That's so stupid!

1910
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,855
No! No, no!
It's like a wink, you know?

1911
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,535
Like at the end of a heist,
you leave your calling card.

1912
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,215
It's like,
"They got us again."

1913
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,049
One big difference,
the heist isn't done!

Fuck me! Shit! They're sending
Garf out to talk to him.

He's so charming,
he'll get the cop to leave.

No, no. There was,

we were coming.

Look, we're in a nice neighborhood.
We want to be good neighbors.

01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,615
I think I like old people shit
better than young people shit now.

2195
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,801
I love brunch.

2196
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:03,095
Oh, it's the best!

2197
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,535
And I get really excited when I
smell freshly ground coffee.

2198
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,895
Me, too, because it's awesome.

2199
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,335
Like, way too excited.

2200
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,495
I want a tomato garden.
How's that?

2201
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:15,775
I love going to The Container
Store and buying containers.

2202
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,881
Me, too.

2203
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,735
I love our hand soap
that's shaped like seashells.

2204
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,886
Why?

2205
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,135
It smells like lemongrass.

2206
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,685
Me, too.

2207
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,095
Do you think
we'll be good parents?

2208
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,964
I think we'll be good
at it and bad at it.

2209
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,487
BOTH: Whoa! (LAUGH)

2210
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:37,055
You know, when we had Stella, I
was afraid of missing the party,

2211
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:40,402
but then I realized
that we are the party.

2212
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,088
This is the only party
I want to be at.

2213
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,165
You're gonna make me cry.

2214
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,611
Don't cry.

2215
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,091
Oh, my God.

2216
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,330
Where did you get that?

2217
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,522
I brought it into bed with us.

2218
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,163
I also got some
ranch dipping sauce.

2219
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,935
Oh, my God.
Mmm-hmm.

2220
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,575
That's the best idea.

2221
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,806
Yeah.

2222
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,206
Mmm!

2223
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,370
TEDDY: Welcome
to Abercrombie.

2224
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,643
Come inside. Check out
some board shorts.

2225
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,770
Hey. Mac!

2226
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,855
Hey, dude.
What's up, man?

2227
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,015
What up, man?
How's it going?

2228
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,520
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

2229
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,015
You're one of those guys!

2230
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,335
I am, yeah.
Yeah.

2231
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,295
It's a pretty good gig.
Yeah.

2232
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,575
You'd be surprised, I actually
meet a shit-ton of girls here.

2233
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,815
Not that surprised.

2234
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,251
Your body basically
looks like a giant arrow

2235
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,775
pointing right
towards your dick.

2236
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,815
Oh, my God. Thank you.
No problem, man.

2237
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,808
I think that's a compliment.
It is a compliment.

2238
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,126
We went nuts.

2239
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,495
It escalated very quickly.

2240
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,763
It escalated to a really crazy place.
That was really nuts, man.

2241
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,895
How are the guys?

2242
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,735
They're all great. They got
a big house off campus.

2243
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,735
Pete's a fancy architect,
designing buildings and stuff.

2244
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:59,255
How's the rest of post-college
life treating you?

2245
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,975
It's good, man.
I'm having fun.

2246
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,895
I realize I probably should
have studied a little bit more.

2247
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,251
Little bit. (LAUGHS)

2248
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,975
But I'm going to night school
to get my degree, so...

2249
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,764
Awesome, man.
Yeah.

2250
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,735
Well, it's still
really good to see you, man.

2251
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,895
Great to see you too, buddy.

2252
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,001
All right, brother.
Good to see you.

2253
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,455
Bring it in for the real thing.

2254
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,655
Nice, okay.
Good to see you, dude.

2255
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:21,603
You know what?
While I'm here...

2256
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,130
I've always wanted to do this.

2257
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,135
All right. Wow,
you're really going for it.

2258
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,730
I'm doing it.
Oh, man.

2259
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,775
So, is it our posture?
Why do we look so different?

2260
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,935
I don't know, man.
Just be free.

2261
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,455
Just kind of let it out.
Okay.

2262
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,641
I feel free.

2263
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,441
(LAUGHS)

2264
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,405
Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.
Can we take your order?

2265
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:43,735
Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.

2266
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,895
Abercrombie, Fitch.

2267
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,255
Welcome to Abercrombie & Fitch.
How you doing?

2268
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,575
Can we take your order?

2269
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,095
We're a great team.
Thanks.

2270
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,560
You make the store
more approachable.

2271
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,615
What does that mean?

2272
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,655
(STAMMERS)

2273
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,815
It's like, I make...

2274
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,255
I'm a more obtainable goal.

2275
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,850
Yeah, you're like
the relaxed-fit jean guy.

2276
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,644
Yeah.
I'm the relaxed-fit jeans.

2277
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,935
I made some blue meth.
It's Gatorade.

2278
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,135
Oh, perfect! Great.

2279
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,575
She's all ready to go.

2280
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,615
This is gonna be
the best calendar yet.

2281
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,815
Look at that, sweetie.

2282
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,335
All right. Let's do it.

2283
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,335
Who's my little Heisenberg?
You are!

2284
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,486
She's a little meth head.

2285
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:20,775
No, she just makes it.

2286
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,086
(COMPUTER RINGING) Oh...

2287
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,169
Hey. Look who it is.
JIMMY: <i>What's up, dude?</i>

2288
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,050
<i>We're at Burning Man!</i>

2289
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,815
<i>Burning Man!</i>

2290
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,001
KELLY: Hey!

2291
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,366
<i>You guys should come here.</i>

2292
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,363
<i>Bring Stella! You can bring kids!
Bring Stella!</i>

2293
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,815
MAC: No.
No, we're making a Stella calendar.

2294
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,015
Yeah, we got six months left.

2295
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,175
She's Heisenberg.
She's Walter White.

2296
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,202
KELLY: See?
<i>You're such a lame-o!</i>

2297
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,295
<i>Don't be so fucking lame!
Totally lame.</i>

2298
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:44,375
<i>It's awesome!</i>

2299
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,765
<i>It only gets better and better!</i>

2300
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,089
I feel completely comfortable
missing that party. Okay.

2301
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,335
We gotta go, okay?
KELLY: We gotta go.

2302
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,055
Yeah, have a good one.
Try not to die.

2303
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,415
What should we do next?

2304
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,015
Don Draper. Yeah.
MAC: Yeah, Don Draper.

2305
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,724
Let's get the leading
men out of the way.

2306
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,364
I love you.
I love you.

2307
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,055
We love you.
We love you.

2308
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,764
Little Walter White.
Baby.

2309
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,804
JIMMY: Sof hamisschak.
<i>It means "game over."</i>
