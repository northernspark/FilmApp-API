00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,707

00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:38,749

00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,040
ls he clean?
- He's clean.

00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,374
Bring him back...

20
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,457
Open it...

21
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,707
This is not mine
l don't own this taxi..

22
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,499
Bingo boys we got him!
- This is not my cab.

23
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,332
They're not yours? You're driving
around with weapons in your taxi..

24
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,832
and you don't know whose they are..
- No... they're not mine...

25
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,165
We know who owns the cab..
Get rid of him...

26
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,790
Sir... there has
been some mistake sir...

27
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,165
some confusion sir...

28
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,749
Sir l finished work at 9'o
clock in the night sir...

29
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,665
and l went straight up from work...

30
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,457
l have no idea...

31
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,040
l've been arrested for what sir?

32
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,582
On what charges sir?

33
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,040
Omar Aijaz...

34
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,999
So you're from Delhi?

35
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,499
Sir you don't need to do
these bonding exercises with me

36
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,874
Sir.. l don't have a clue how
that stuff landed in my cab...

37
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,415
or who put it there...
why am l here?

38
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,874
This is an FBl lnterrogation room...

39
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,374
and it's me who asks questions...

40
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,415
When did you first visit America?

41
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:03,665
l want a lawyer.

42
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,165
You're not getting one.

43
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,457
What?
- You've been detained...

44
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,749
Which means that you may
want to talk to someone...

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,374
but you can't...
you're not allowed to.

46
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,915
The Patriot Act empowers
me to detain a suspect

47
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:26,665
in order to prevent
an act of terrorism..

48
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,957
Terrorism?

49
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,082
What does that mean?

50
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,790
What do l have to do with terrorism?

51
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,707
We'll soon find out...

52
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,499
So start talking... when was
your first visit to America?

53
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,457
September 1 999.

54
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:50,999
99... exactly two years before 9/1 1 ?

55
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,957
What do you mean?

56
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,707
Just answer the question...

57
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,332
Why did you come to America?

58
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,165
l got a scholarship...

59
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:08,582
For my Masters at New
York State University...

60
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,374
Two years at the university..
you must have had friends...

61
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,874
Name them.

62
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,082
Yohann... Anil...
Kevin.. Sarah... Harminder..

63
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,374
And...

64
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,624
And?

65
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,290
You forgot one.

66
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,249
Who?

67
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,999
Sam... your dearest friend.

68
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,290
Why did you hide his name?

69
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,415
l didn't... l just
did not remember him..

70
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,957
Didn't remember?

71
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,040
You've been brought here
only to talk about him..

72
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,832
How can you force me?

73
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,582
l hope it doesn't come
down to that, my friend.

74
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,874
l need a lawyer.

75
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,124
Forget it.
- This is illegal!

76
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,582
You must remember
one thing my brother..

77
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,374
you're not talking
to a damn policeman..

78
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,790
you're dealing with the FBl...

79
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,124
lf we need to break the law...

80
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,540
for this country's safety..
we do it..

81
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,874
Okay...

82
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,957
We have recovered AK-47s..

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,165
and plastic
explosives from your taxi...

84
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,957
so you don't talk about legality...

85
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,707
That is not my stuff...

86
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,165
Then prove it!

87
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,915
Sir... please... listen to me...

88
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,249
Tell me about Sam...

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,290
What does Sam have
to do with all this?

90
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,832
l haven't seen him in 7 years...

91
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,707
Why haven't you seen him?

92
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,290
l haven't seen a lot
of people in 7 years..

93
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,665
And what is it that you
want to know about him?

94
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,540
Every damn thing...

95
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,207
Let's start from the beginning...

96
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,957
and try not to
forget anything this time.

97
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,832
l was born in Delhi...

98
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,207
No... no... cut Delhi...

99
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,790
cut lndia...

100
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,457
Start from America...

101
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,832
My first day at the university...

102
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,040
New York State Uni?ersity...

103
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,999
Thank you...
- Sure... have fun...

104
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,624
lt was my first trip out of lndia...

105
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,707
l was nervous...

106
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,957
l didn't have a clue
who to talk to...

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,540
or what to talk about.

108
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,040
This was a different world for me...

109
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,290
Hi... l'm Maya.

110
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,457
Hello...

111
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,082
You are Omar... right?

112
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,957
How do you know my name?

113
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,499
And you're from lndia...

114
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,040
How do you know all this?

115
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,332
l also know that
you're one semester late..

116
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,957

117
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,082
You speak Hindi?

118
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,957
l speak Hindi...
l even watch Hindi films..

119
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,582
don't like them much
but l have to..

120
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,874
my mother you know...

121
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,957
she'd dump my dad in a
second for Shah Rukh Khan.

122
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,457
Anyway... you're looking
for your lecture room..

123
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,124
come with me...

124
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,290
Thanks...

125
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,124
Let me introduce myself again.

126
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,999
My name is Maya, and l'm
your student counsellor..

127
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,624
that's how l know all this.

128
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,707
l had your admission file.

129
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,790
But there are so many people here...

130
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,790
How did you find me?

131
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,457
lt's not that
difficult really to find..

132
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,790
a good looking lndian
boy fresh off the boat..

133
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:15,124
a crisp shirt neatly tucked
into his terricot trousers..

134
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,082
l'm kidding.. your
file had a photograph.

135
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,624
See you later Matt..

136
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,165
Where are all these guys going?

137
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,165
The annual challenge...
- What's that?

138
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,915
lt's a college
tradition where a new student..

139
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,832
challenges the college champion..

140
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,457
in a bizarre race.

141
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,624
Why bizarre?

142
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:38,249
See for yourself...
and meet the challenger...

143
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,624
He's our classmate...

144
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,332
and loves to be the
centre of attention... c'mon..

145
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,374
The race starts as soon as the
clock tower strikes twel?e...

146
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,499
no one has e?er completed the
race before the twelfth gong..

147
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,374
come on!

148
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,624

00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,124

Dude... l told you l'd win...

166
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,249
Aren't you happy?
- Of course...

167
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,790
Then give me a hug...

168
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,915
Ah... have a shower first..

169
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,374
Sure... come baby...

170
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,957
Keep dreaming dude...

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,165
come... you give me a hug...

172
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,290
Hi l'm Sam...

173
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,790
Hi... l'm Omar... l have just come...

174
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,999
Really... with just a hug?

175
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,957
c'mon... give him a break...

176
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,582
Just kidding Omar..
Welcome to New York

177
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,249
Thank you.
- c'mon...

178
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,957
How was he as a student?

179
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,207
lmpressive... good at sports...

180
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,707
spoke well... got good grades...

181
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,540
he had just one problem...

182
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,332
people found him arrogant...

183
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,207
Arrogant?

184
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,040
l guess he was...

185
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,499
How did you become friends?

186
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,707
Maya reached college at 7.50...

187
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,999
l would get there 5
minutes before her and wait..

188
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,374
l used to look out for her..

189
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,749
and we went to class together.

190
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,415
Hey Omar!

191
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,082
After a few days,
this became a routine..

192
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,457
l liked spending those
1 0 minutes with her...

193
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,290
Just her...

194
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,207
Maya..

195
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,957
Now what?

196
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:13,374
Every time l ask you about Sam,
you start talking about Maya.

197
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:19,499
Sir... you said... you
need all the details...

198
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,374
l'm doing just that...

199
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,749
Ya... go on... continue...

200
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,790
Hi... what's going on?

201
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:39,999
What else... the attention seeker
seeks attention... and gets it..

202
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,999
Sam plays chess?

203
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,082
Yup... thinks he's a grandmaster...

204
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,790
claims that no one can beat him..
that's his challenge...

205
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,040
checkmate!

206
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,165
Do you want to take three
moves back and play again?

207
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:05,957
Three moves back?

208
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,665
l'm giving you a chance...

209
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,374
Show off...

210
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:11,957
You still win...

211
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,790
c'mon guys... anybody? c'mon...

212
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,332

213
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,749
can l try?

214
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,749
Sure...

215
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,290
Are you sure?

216
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,957
check...

217
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,249
l don't need the third move Sam...

218
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,249
checkmate!

219
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,749
Dude... How did you do that?

220
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,915
Superb man!

221
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,582
Show me.. show me again...
- Our friendship started with chess...

222
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,124
and soon l became
a part of his gang.

223
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,707
Yes!

224
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,124
Touch down!

225
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,499

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,165
our time is about to come

237
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,749

241
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,790
We have passion..

242
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,749
Great run... Omar...

243
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,665
we have passion in our li?es

244
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,874
Dude... you're learning fast...

245
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,957
Nothing much to learn...

246
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,457
just catch the ball and run...

247
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,874
Fine... you start this time...

248
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,040
What kind of game is this...

249
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,374
You hold the ball in your
hand and call it football..

250
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,082
who the hell piles on like that...

251
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,999
all on one guy...
you're not playing kabaddi.

252
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,957
Honestly... e?en l find this
game very strange but Sam likes it..

253
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,874
That's why he gets
everyone here each weekend..

254
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,874
Yeah... he almost
got me killed there..

255
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,665
No. He likes you. He doesn't
ha?e too many lndian friends..

256
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,999
Why?

257
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,124
He's just so American in his ways.

258
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,749
He's been living here
since he was 4 years old.

259
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,457
His father is a professor...
an expert on lndian culture...

260
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,957
that's why he's so fluent in Hindi...

261
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,957
otherwise he would ha?e
been totally American..

262
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,999
Like you?

263
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,707
l look American to you?

264
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,207
You surely look American...

265
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,290
your attitude is definitely American

266
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,790
but you manage to
speak decent Hindi...

267
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,249
Mom...

268
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,124
She spoke only in Hindi
to me since l was small...

269
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,790
she loves to talk about lndia...

270
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,832
ln fact... you should
come home sometime..

271
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,582
she'll really like you...

272
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,915
Somewhere.. a certain

273
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,499
melody begins

274
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,124
Along our paths look..

275
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,457
there are marvels in all their glory

276
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,957
Us.. just us in this world

277
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,332
Everywhere

278
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,457
To brighten our dreams
we have found a reason

279
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,957
Somewhere.. a certain

280
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,165
melody begins

281
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,332
Along our paths look..

282
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,540
there are marvels in all their glory

283
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,874
Us.. just us in this world

284
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,332
Everywhere

285
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,457
To brighten our dreams

286
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,624
we have found a reason

287
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,499
What if this..

288
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,832
is not true

289
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,040
what is it then..

290
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,999
that is true

291
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,540
Hey friends.. on your own terms

292
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,957
on the pages of your hearts

293

294
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,707
Hey friends.. to worry about results

295
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,082
ls not what this age does

296
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,957
then why have any fear at all

297
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,290
We have passion..

298
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,999
We have passion in our lives

299
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,499
We have passion..

300
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:00,665
We have passion in our hearts

301
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,874
We have passion..

check out those broads... dude...

303
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,249
Broad... what a strange word...

304
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,165
l mean... doesn't broad mean wide...

305
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,874
then how can that be a girl?

306
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,249
Okay... what do you
call sexy girls in Delhi?

307
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:37,082
We call them Maal... Katto...

308
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,707
That sounds pretty cool... Katto...

309
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,749
Katto!

310
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:42,957
Totta...

311
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,124
Tota... But Tota is a parrot...

312
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,582
Not tota my dear... totta... totta...

00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,957
Hey Friends.. lets live
this moment to it's fullest

337
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,290
lt seems now

338
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,499
Our time is about to come

339
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:58,165
Hey friends.. if you
belie?e in yourself

340
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,457
then life is beautiful

341
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,332
Tomorrow beckons you

342
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:06,374
We have passion..

343
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,582
we have passion in our li?es

344
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:16,124
We have passion..

345
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,082
we have passion in our hearts

346
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,707
We have passion..

347
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,957
we have passion in our li?es

348
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,540
We have passion..

349
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:38,624
we have passion in our hearts

350
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,540
l don't know how those two years...

351
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,290
flew by with Sam and Maya...

352
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,832
time just went by..

353
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,415
That's Zaheer... from Pakistan...

354
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,249
came from Quetta...
stayed there for two years...

355
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,957
and has been in
New York for 8 years..

356
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:12,874
he's an illegal immigrant...

357
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:18,832
Malik... also from Pakistan..
came via Germany..

358
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:22,415
Yaqub... from Bangladesh...

359
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:28,124
Yaseer... Afghan... he's a mute.

360
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,082
All are suspected terrorists...

361
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,124
members of a South
Asian sleeper cell..

362
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,957
we found clues from a hard disk...

363
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,707
that we got in a
Middle East operation.

364
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,624
Why are you showing me all this?

365
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:47,207
Because they all work
for the same person..

366
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,332
you've been working for...
Your friend... Samir Sheikh..

367
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,499
for whom you were transporting guns

368
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,999
in your taxi yesterday.

369
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,665
Am l right? Am l right? Am l right?

370
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,165
You're mad!

371
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,874
This is what you show me
after all that bullshit..

372
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,790
Samir's a terrorist..
l'm a terrorist..

373
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:07,999
and you are completely crazy!

374
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:09,957
you admitted that this
man is your friend..

375
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,374
he runs a sleeper cell in New York...

376
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,332
you are and always have
been his accomplice...

377
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,915
We recovered arms from your taxi..

378
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,082
You're talking nonsense...

379
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,790
neither was l transporting guns
in my cab..

380
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,832
nor can Samir be
running a Sleeper cell..

381
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,207
You have lost it...
you've gone mad...

382
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,790
Where were you transporting
those guns and explosives?

383
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,082
prepare an answer to that question
in your 6 by 6 cell tonight..

384
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:34,540
or you're in deep shit my brother.

385
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,999
Sir... listen to me...

386
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:44,957
You're framing me...
l'm not a terrorist..

387
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:48,624
and neither can Sam be one...

388
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,374
Where were you transporting
those guns and explosives?

389
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:58,082
prepare an answer to that question
in your 6 by 6 cell tonight..

390
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:02,457
The Patriot Act empowers
me to detain a suspect

391
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:03,999
l want a lawyer.
- You're not getting one.

392
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:08,332
We have recovered AK-47s and
plastic explosives from your taxi..

393
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,707
so you don't talk about legality...

394
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:13,290
for the same person you've been
working for... Samir Sheikh...

395
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,832
Your friend... you admitted
that this man is your friend..

396
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,124
he runs a sleeper cell in New York...

397
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,040
you are and always have
been his accomplice...

398
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,499
Why haven't you seen him in 7 years?

399
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:22,915
Welcome to New York.

400
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,082
Omar... Omarr...

401
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,874
One more... one more...

402
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,624
c'mon Another one...

403
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:43,874
Sam... c'mon... Sam... photo...

404
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,665
Sam... dude...

405
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:56,957
Sam...

406
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:01,374
Totta...

407
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,249
Totta?

408
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,790
Keep at it dude... Totta!

409
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,790
c'mon let's go...
c'mon, c'mon let's go..

410
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:16,999
What happened?

411
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:18,957
Nothing...

412
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,790
Then why did we come out
so suddenly..

413
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,707
l didn't like the music..

414
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:28,624
ls that all...

415
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,915
Life is just a dream..

416
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:40,082
And in a dream.. what's a fantasy...

417
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:43,415
and what is real..

418
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,874
Look... lt's raining...

419
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,624
lt's cold.

420
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,832
Whatever my heart..

421
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,707
told me to do.. l did

422
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,749
just that

423
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:57,874
Whatever my heart..

424
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,332
told me to do.. l did

425
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:03,249
just that

426
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:07,707
Someday at leisure l will wonder

427
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:11,165
was it wrong or right

428
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,790
What?

429
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,874
can you help a poor
man with some change?

430
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,124
Ya sure...

431
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,957
Omar, what are you doing?
Let's leave.

432
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,707
Your bag and earrings... quick...

433
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:24,290
Give me your bag and earrings...
quick...

434
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,665
What the hell do you
think you are doing?

435
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,874
l think l need to ask
you that question...

436
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:32,999
Don't mess with me man...

437
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,249
Omar... grab him from the back..
l'll get his hands..

438
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,082
Hey what did you say?
- Sam... Maya's with us..

439
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,790
Sam! Hey!

440
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,749
There's nothing in that bag...

441
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,207
Sam..

442
00:29:58,583 --> 00:29:59,790
Sam...

443
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:05,832
Oh my God! Sam... are you okay?

444
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,499
Omar listen... call somebody..
call an ambulance..

445
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,915
Wake up Sam.. please wake up!

446
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:12,040
l love you Sam!

447
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,207
Listen to me..

448
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,457
Stay with me okay.. stay with me..

449
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,290
Baby.. l love you baby.

450
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,999
Why do you do these things..

451
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,374
Because l love you Maya..

452
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,915
l love you too baby.

453
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:29,540

454
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,499
What you never uttered..

455
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,415
is what l always heard..

456
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,540
for no reason

457
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:41,665
l began to weave dreams..

458
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:56,582
What you never uttered..

459
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,624
is what l always heard..

460
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,624
for no reason

461
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,332
l began to weave dreams..

462
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,624
Don't know how

463
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:11,415
our lives got torn apart..

464
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,957
this town of mine..

465
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,582
was no longer mine

466
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,540
Away from my love
- Omar.

467
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:23,124
l kept walking away

468
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,624
for no reason

469
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:29,957
l began to weave dreams..

470
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,624
Are you alright, Omar?
l didn't see you after that night.

471
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,707
You disappeared from the hospital.

472
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:43,124
Yes... sorry. college
is coming to an end..

473
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,540
l had to pack some things...

474
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:52,249
You know when l met
Sam for the first time..

475
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,707
l found him rather odd...

476
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,999
He thought the world of himself...

477
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:05,957
but then, l don't know how,
l started to like him..

478
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:14,249
and l realised it
that night when l saw

479
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,832
him in that state...

480
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,999
l think l'm in love with him...

481
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:35,499
Yes, l heard they discharged
him the next day... that's great.

482
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,374
You haven't met him yet?

483
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:41,165
No... like l said...
l was packing some stuff..

484
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:46,415
What are you packing that
doesn't let you meet your friends?

485
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:54,415
Maya... l don't belong to
this place... like Sam and you..

486
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,540
l must keep everything
with a lot of care..

487
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:03,040
..and in any case you're
here to take care of him..

488
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,665
Why are you being so strange Omar?

489
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,165
l'm sorry... l'm in a strange mood...

490
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:12,332
college is about to end..
that's why maybe..

491
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,540
Only college is coming to an end..
not our friendship...

492
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,624
Yes... but l don't
know why l feel like

493
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,540
a lot more is coming to an end...

494
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:26,749
lt seems that night
really shook you up..

495
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:32,165
Yes Maya, it sure did.

496
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:35,790
Listen... its okay.

497
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,040
l know Samir is a little crazy but...

498
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,874
You always called him
crazy and l thought that..

499
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:43,957
What?

500
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:49,290
Why didn't you tell me Maya..
that you and Sam..

501
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,832
Omar... you?

502
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:11,457
lt was chaos!

503
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,457
Oh my God!

504
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:23,832
A plane had crashed into one tower
of New York's World Trade centre

505
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,207
lt was chaos!

506
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,415
We just saw another one..

507
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,790
Another plane just flew
into the second tower.

508
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:48,957
l can't believe this.

509
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,790
This raises.. this has
to be deliberate folks..

510
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,457
Oh my God!

511
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,374
Skyline of Manhattan
has changed forever..

512
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,124
New York's twin towers are gone.

513
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:37,290
This is awful..

514
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:58,790
We have passion.. we
ha?e passion in our lives

515
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:16,374
We have passion.. we
ha?e passion in our hearts

516
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,707
No one realized it at that time...

517
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:23,665
but that one day
changed our lives... fore?er.

518
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,749
l left New York that evening..

519
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,665
and moved to Philadelphia...

520
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:40,290
l don't know where
Sam and Maya are...

521
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,624
They're married now...
and they have a son...

522
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,207
l want to belie?e you...

523
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:04,040
but then l can't deny the truth...

524
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:13,249
Truth is... that neither me
nor Samir are terrorists...

525
00:37:14,916 --> 00:37:20,457
Sir, by now you should know
that he wasn't like that...

526
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,082
Don't defend Samir...
just speak for yourself...

527
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:25,374
we have enough evidence
against him...

528
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,124
Then why don't you go and get him...

529
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,249
why have you kept me here?

530
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,790
l've told you a thousand times...
those are not my guns...

531
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,957
lt doesn't matter if you tell
me a hundred thousand times...

532
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,249
or you shout all day...
who is going to hear you...

533
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,832
how are you going to prove it?

534
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,415
Okay...

535
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,165
then someday you will
find yourself blindfolded...

536
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,124
seated in a plane...

537
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,332
And dumped in a
prison in some place...

538
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:56,124
that you will never know about...

539
00:37:56,541 --> 00:38:00,999
which country, town or
jungle that's going to be...

540
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,749
will be a mystery for me as well...

541
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,415
What do you want?

542
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,874
l want to help you...
you're not letting me...

543
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,249
lf you can't help yourself,
no one else can..

544
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:15,290
How? l swear l don't know a thing...

545
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:19,165
Why don't you arrest him...
l honestly don't know...

546
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,207
You can do one thing...

547
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:30,499
Why don't you go back
to Sam... as a friend...

548
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,749
...but at the same time work for
us... give us information about him.

549
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:39,499
This is probably the only way
you could prove your innocence...

550
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,582
this is the only chance.

551
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,457
Oh... so that was your idea...

552
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,207
that's what you want me to do...

553
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,165
that's why you planted
those weapons in my cab...

554
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,874
l'm sorry...

555
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:12,457
l won't do it... is that clear?

556
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:19,540
You have no idea what
these people could do to you...

557
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,249
You're in detention...

558
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:25,707
soon you will forget how to
walk straight or talk right...

559
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,499
you will want to sleep
but won't be allowed to...

560
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,332
is that clear?

561
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,249
l won't betray my friend...

562
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,290
l'm not asking you to betray anyone...

563
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,582
l'm just saying co-operate with us...

564
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:42,540
if you do, you will be
helping this country...

565
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,665
then l can tell my seniors
that they should be lenient

566
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,165
with a boy who is helping
us unco?er a sleeper cell...

567
00:39:50,916 --> 00:39:52,540
are you getting me?

568
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,082
Spare a thought for
your 70 year old father...

569
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,415
all alone in a single room at

570
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,249
Lajpat Nagar... do you
realize what might happen..

571
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,707
when the news spreads in lndia

572
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:04,874
that Omar Aijaz is a terrorist?
What he will go through?

573
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:09,082
What about Maya?
That poor girl doesn't

574
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,749
even know that her husband is a...

575
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:15,290
Don't you want to help her?

576
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,290
Think about it...

577
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:27,874
l'll see you tomorrow.

578
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,874
The usual.. make it double...

579
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:07,957
Thanks.

580
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,707
You think this idea of
yours is going to work?

581
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,624
Maybe... are you scared?

582
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,624
Are you what?

583
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:24,165
Scared...

584
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:30,749
You know Roshan, its been fifteen
years and l still can't understand..

585
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,582
that damn accent of yours...

586
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,582
l'm on this case
because l'm a South Asian...

587
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:37,207
so you need me to
speak the way l do...

588
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,915
and Gibson... fifteen years...

589
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,540
1 5 years.. you can't
say my name properly.

590
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,832
lts not Rowshaen... its Roshan.

591
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,832
Ya... Ya...

592
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:55,290
You know... l've put my ass on the
line for this crazy idea of yours...

593
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,499
if this goes bad... it means there

594
00:41:57,583 --> 00:42:00,707
will be a terrorist attack that
we knew about and did nothing...

595
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,707
that makes us accomplices...

596
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:06,999
Look at it this way...
if it works...

597
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:09,790
you become a hero.

598
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,249
And what if it doesn't?

599
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,207
Then we both are screwed...

600
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,374
What?

601
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,124
Screwed... as in...

602
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,790
ls anybody there?
can you listen to me?

603
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:29,749
Hello! l need to speak to somebody...
c'mon get somebody here...

604
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,874
l want someone right now...
right here...

605
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,665
can you listen to me?

606
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:37,957
Why the hell are you
screaming at this hour?

607
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:39,124
l need to speak to the officer.

608
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,332
You gotta wait till the morning.

609
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:41,915
l can't wait...
l want to speak to him now...

610
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,415
Why me?

611
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:55,207
lf you need an infiltrator
to go to Sam....

612
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,207
...you have your people... why me?

613
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:03,207
ls this why you've
called me at this hour?

614
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,582
Yes.

615
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,957
Who do you think
could stay with Sam and

616
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,957
Maya in their house... besides you?

617
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:21,415
What am l going to tell them?

618
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:25,665
where was l for 7 years...
what was l doing...

619
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,582
And why have l come to them now?

620
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:30,040
You're friends with Sam and Maya...

621
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,249
they have no reason to doubt you...

622
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,249
we'll give you a back story...
a new identity...

623
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:42,249
so don't worry about it...

624
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,832
you just have to say yes...

625
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,124
Alright...

626
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,374
Yes?

627
00:43:56,458 --> 00:44:00,040
Alright... l'll do it.

628
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:02,707
Good... good...

629
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:10,207
Now let's go to sleep... ya?

630
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,707
Just a minute officer...

631
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:21,457
l have agreed not because
l'm keen to help the FBl...

632
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:26,624
it's only to prove that
Samir and l are not terrorists...

633
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,915
Works for me!

634
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,207
Thanks...

635
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,957
What a friendship!

636
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:49,290
You must have fired many guns?

637
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,749
Oh yes... l would shoot
balloons during Diwali fairs.

638
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:57,624
Then you must be a good shot.

639
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,332
Relax! Relax your elbows...

640
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,665
control your breath when you fire...

641
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:26,874
l'm going there as their friend,
so why do l need all this?

642
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,915
Because... when you tell him
that you want to work with him...

643
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:35,332
he will definitely test you... and
l don't want you to fail the test.

644
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,957
No one in the FBl
knows of this operation...

645
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:40,874
besides me and my senior.

646
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:01,499
Hi... we booked a room
in the name of Omar Aijaz.

647
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:03,207
Let me check sir...

648
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,290
Are you with Northwest chemicals?

649
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:12,290
That's right.

650
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,749
Okay..

651
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,207
Omar... it's very
important for this mission..

652
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,249
that you stay in Samir's house...

653
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,290
l don't want you to appear hasty...

654
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,290
but shift in with them at
the first opportunity...

655
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:35,124
Okay... so two of my
men will come to you..

656
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:38,332
at 1 0 tomorrow morning...
they'll take you to a school...

657
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,415
Sam and Maya's son
goes to that school...

658
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,624
Maya will be there to pick him up...

659
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,874
Here... spare keys... just in case...

660
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,457
You do have a driver's license...
right?

661
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,790
No... can we cancel the mission?

662
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,999
Don't ask me stupid questions...

663
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:05,749
Do you see those kids at the gate...

664
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:09,957
What else will l see there?

665
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:12,499
No, the boy with the
blue and yellow bag...

666
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,374
that's Maya's son...

667
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:21,957
She'll be at the entrance
after she parks her car...

668
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,499
you'll see her as she
comes to the entrance...

669
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:27,790
she's there... she's there...
can you see her?

670
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:31,790

671
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:34,749
There she was...
revealed to me again

672
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:37,957
Memories came rushing back

673
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:41,165
My eyes began to water

674
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,749
with the smoke of yesterday

675
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,749
Your condition is nothing like mine

676
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,124
Why in this joy

677
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,374
am l still feeling pain

678
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,332
why am l beginning to again create

679
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,124
that world

680
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:02,832
That world

681
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:04,707
away from where

682
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:07,249
l had long walked away

683
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,332
Once again these memories

684
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:13,124
have made a new beginning

685
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:16,290
A moment of the past

686
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:19,165
Still made my heart ache

687
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:22,290
for no reason

688
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:25,290
l began to weave dreams..

689
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:28,249
What you never uttered..

690
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:31,249
is what l always heard..

691
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,332
for no reason

692
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,040
l began to weave dreams..

693
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,582
Have you lost your mind?

694
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,790
lf he backs out... l'll
hand over the case to you...

695
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:51,249
l'll give you all the
evidence l have on Samir Sheikh...

696
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:53,415
l'll shoot that terrorist...

697
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:56,415
and l will do it like tomorrow.

698
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:21,249
lf you're right about
Samir running a sleeper cell...

699
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,957
Then?

700
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,957
Then... you have to
promise me something...

701
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,457
What promise?

702
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,832
That... you won't kill Samir...

703
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:36,832
lf you can convince
him to surrender...

704
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,165
then l can promise you that...

705
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,040
l guarantee that.

706
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:51,415
Okay...

707
00:49:52,791 --> 00:50:06,457
let's do it.

708
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,374
Hello...

709
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,457
Yes..

710
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:26,540
Hello..

711
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,332
Make a turn ahead and try again...

712
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:30,332
and keep talking to me
on the phone...

713
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,999
Yes... l just made a turn...
she's coming towards me...

714
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,457
lf she doesn't see you... at least
she'll recognise your voice...

715
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,207
Ya... she's right in
front of me... relax...

716
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,874
Oh yeah... l'll see you this
evening... for sure... l promise...

717
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,249
She didn't see me...

718
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:51,749
c'mon speak louder on
the phone... concentrate...

719
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:54,957
Listen l'm trying my best...
give me one chance... please...

720
00:50:55,625 --> 00:51:02,040
Omar... Oh my God! l can't believe
it's you... what are you doing here?

721
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,665
Wow! lt's been so long...

722
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,082
l know!

723
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:10,082
Oh... this is Danyal... my son...

724
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:12,082
Are you serious?

725
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:15,957
Hi Danyal... l'm Omar...

726
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,415
Hi Omar.

727
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,332
His looks just like Samir...

728
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:22,457
he has your eyes...

729
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,624
but otherwise...
he's just like Samir...

730
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,624
Really?
- Ya!

731
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,999
But l didn't marry Samir...

732
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,540
Look at your face!

733
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:49,582
you're talking like you were at our
wedding... you just disappeared...

734
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:52,915
Where is Samir?

735
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:55,332
l can't believe l let
you talk me into this...

736
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:05,499
Stop walking around
on this damn thing...

737
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,499
Mark... l brought you up
here to show

738
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,499
you how much effort
goes into this...

739
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,207
Six of my men will be
sticking to your

740
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,082
walls for the next six days...

741
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:16,374
6 days? l' can't have
these spidermen

742
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,499
crawling around my
windows for 6 days...

743
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:20,040
Why don't you hire more boys?

744
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,999
More boys means more money Mark...

745
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,499
Your rates are too high...

746
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:25,957
Nobody does as
complete a job as us Mark...

747
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,957
you know that. Think about it.

748
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,374
Alright... just get me
down from here alright...

749
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:31,665
Excuse me...

750
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,207
Yes Maya...

751
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:35,874
Samir... l want you
to talk to somebody...

752
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,332
Hi Samir...

753
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:41,874
Who is this?

754
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:43,332
How are you buddy?

755
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,457
Omar!

756
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,374
Sam... everything had
changed after 9/1 1 ...

757
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:55,290
you know how it was...

758
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:01,707
people stared at me on the
streets like l was a terrorist...

759
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:07,374
l was scared... after
that l went back to lndia...

760
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:11,499
when l tried to return...
l was denied a visa...

761
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:14,915
they didn't like
my name it seems... Omar.

762
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:21,082
l tried for months...
then l just gave up...

763
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,540
and now l'm finally here...
after years.

764
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:25,999
That's great.

765
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:28,749
And the moment l reached...

766
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,874
l bumped into you guys...
lsn't that strange?

767
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,374
Very strange.

768
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:39,665
l'm doing fine at the hotel...

769
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,290
and anyway my company will give me..

770
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,332
a service apartment in
two weeks... l'm okay.

771
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:44,624
Nothing doing...

772
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,415
you're going to stay
right here with us...

773
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,249
at least till you
get your apartment...

774
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:52,040
No Sam... l'm good at my hotel...

775
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,707
Okay... do as you like...

776
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,249
l can't force you...

777
00:53:58,416 --> 00:54:02,290
come on... now you're upset.
Okay fine... l'll stay here.

778
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,290
No... if you're happy there then
l don't want to disturb you...

779
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,457
What happened?

780
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,915
Omar doesn't want to stay with us...

781
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:12,249
he's happy at his hotel...
- Really?

782
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:16,790
Hey... Now both of you are upset...

783
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,124
okay fine... l'll
shift here tomorrow...

784
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:19,915
Good... so it's final...

785
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:21,415
you're gonna stay with us.

786
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,957
come now... it's 1 o'clock...

787
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:25,207
let's go to sleep... we
all have to work tomorrow...

788
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:29,749
Not yet... l need to
settle an old score with him...

789
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,165
come on... You can't
take so much time...

790
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:51,790
What is going on here?

791
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:57,124
This is the limit now...
something is happening everyday now...

792
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:59,832
when the hell will
you guys stop all this?

793
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,957
You guys... what do you mean?

794
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,165
You guys... you Americans...

795
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:08,040
when will you learn that
this is not the way...

796
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:12,290
You seem to be very
interested in these issues?

797
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:16,124
Why wouldn't l be? lt
affects all of us...

798
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,415
don't you get affected?

799
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:25,665
Yes l do Omar... but what can we do
about it? lt's not in our control.

800
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:29,499
come on... l think if we want to...
then we can do a lot...

801
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:33,749
and l don't believe that
you're talking like such a loser...

802
00:55:34,625 --> 00:55:36,124
Loser?

803
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,957
Yes! You had strong opinions
about things in college...

804
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,749
you took a stand on everything...

805
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:44,915
even when it was not necessary...
and look at you now...

806
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,874
What are you trying to say... Omar?

807
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,374
That we should go and
fight for these issues?

808
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,499
Are you crazy?

809
00:55:55,958 --> 00:56:00,165
Sometimes l feel like...

810
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,415
Like what?

811
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,540
That one day... l'll just lea?e aside
everything and... just one day Sam...

812
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,290
One day... what?

813
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,499
Forget it... lets go to sleep.
come...

814
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:17,915
And this...

815
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,749
This? We can finish
this in the morning...

816
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:24,082
anyway you were losing...

817
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:55,874
Omar... my office is a block ahead...

818
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:58,249
yours is two blocks away...

819
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,832
Omar... come over if
you're free for lunch...

820
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:12,332
Sure... What about you Sam?

821
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:14,082
l'm sorry guys...
l have a lunch meeting.

822
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,624
Hey Maya, by the way...
what exactly do you do?

823
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,790
Let's meet for lunch...
l'll tell you everything... See you...

824
00:57:29,333 --> 00:57:30,957
That's my office building...

825
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:32,832
Which floor?
- 1 8th...

826
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,665
Nice... let me come with you...
l have time for a cup of coffee.

827
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,499
Let me settle in first.

828
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:42,290
l mean.. l'm just 3 days old there.

829
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,624
l'm still an outsider...
you know what l mean...

830
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:47,832
Okay, never mind.
See you this evening.

831
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,207
See you... bye.
- Bye.

832
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:22,915
Good morning Mr. Aijaz... Your 9.30
appointment is waiting for you.

833
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,374
Ya... l'll just be there.

834
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,540
What happened Sam?

835
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,665
You forgot this in the car...

836
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:33,374
Thanks... how about coffee?

837
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:37,790
No... your appointment
waits for you... See you..

838
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:43,332
Tota!

839
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,915
Welcome back Omar...

840
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,957
Too much cheese on pasta.

841
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,582
My wife is an ltalian..

842
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,290
20 years... l have been telling her..

843
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:31,374
don't overdo the cheese...
l hate pasta...

844
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,207
there are some things in life
that you just cannot digest...

845
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:36,749
can you come to the point please.

846
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,832
Oh... you want me to
come to the point?

847
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,415
Ya...

848
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:46,124
This... take this with you when
you shift to their house today...

849
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:52,665
keep one in the living room
and one stays in your pocket...

850
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:57,665
What is it?

851
00:59:58,166 --> 00:59:59,915
Micro transmitters.

852
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,332
This degrading job of
spying on my friends...

853
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,957
either l do it my
way or no way at all...

854
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,999
first your James Bonds
in those black SUVs...

855
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:12,790
and then this...
whatever you call it.

856
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:14,999
We can call it quits
right here right now...

857
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:17,790
Go ahead... arrest me...
slap me with your charges...

858
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,832
and get one of your own
cronies to do this job... l mean it!!

859
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,957
You could have said this without
smashing those transmitters...

860
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:47,540
They were Americans...
FBl... l was blindfolded...

861
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:51,082
it was a 9 or 1 0 hour long flight...
then a two hour drive...

862
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:53,124
then they stopped... got us down...

863
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:57,749
that's what l remember...
l had to climb a lot of stairs...

864
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:00,540
after which l was left alone...

865
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:05,665
..then some people came
and untied my blindfold...

866
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,999
come... it's okay.

867
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:17,874
Please continue Zilgai.

868
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,415
Three months later l was dumped...

869
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,415
at the detention centre right here.

870
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,665
What did they do to you
in detention?

871
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:30,040
What else... they would
forcibly strip us naked...

872
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:31,957
and assault us.

873
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,624
They would handcuff
us to the ceiling..

874
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,915
and keep us hanging that
way for up to 40 hours...

875
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:42,082
then... they would put
a hood on us...

876
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:49,415
and urinate on it... on our face...

877
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,957
they didn't let us go
to the toilet...

878
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,999
We were forced to relieve
ourselves... in our clothes...

879
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:06,915
Then... they'd say - your mother...
your sisters... are whores...

880
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,957
they would abuse us...

881
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:14,165
Then they would get a dog collar...
and tie it around our neck.

882
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:15,707
They would pull us by that leash...
all day long...

883
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:17,415
and grill us for 20
hours at a stretch...

884
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:26,374
cooperate with us... cooperate with
us... that's what they would say...

885
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,999
or else we'll send you to a place

886
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:31,582
from where you will never return...

887
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,082
Who was this man, Maya?

888
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:42,874
Zilgai... works with Samir...

889
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,124
Thanks.

890
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:48,082
he is a suspected terrorist...
l mean.. he was..

891
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,749
they illegally
detained him after 9/1 1 ...

892
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,249
His statement has been
presented at least 5 or 6 times,

893
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:56,957
but no one has bothered.

894
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:00,832
We're representing his case
against the government agencies...

895
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:03,707
he's pretty distressed...

896
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,957
You are doing a great job Maya...

897
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,582
But... there's injustice
happening against people..

898
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:14,499
and we human rights
workers can't stop the damage...

899
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,082
it gets pretty depressing sometimes.

900
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:19,540
Sorry.

901
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:20,915
'Trouble'

902
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:27,165
Hello... - Hey! You're
ha?ing lunch with Maya...

903
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:29,749
That's great... isn't it?

904
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,957
How do you know that?

905
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,665
Never ask an FBl
officer that... okay...

906
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:42,957
remember the gun l gave you...
don't forget...

907
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:44,540
you remember what it's for, right?

908
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,582
Yes, l remember...

909
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:50,124
l'm at your hotel.
l've made the payment.

910
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:52,707
So you can check out in the evening.

911
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:28,374
Wow
- Danny... Danyal...

912
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:31,540
cool... right dad?

913
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:32,957
Danny!

914
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,082
Where did you find this?

915
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:44,415
Go play with Mummy! And listen...

916
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,957
don't tell her about the gun...
okay?

917
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:47,999
Okay...
- Go.

918
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:03,374
What's this Omar?

919
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:05,165
Where did you find it?

920
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,749
l found it in Danyal's hands...

921
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:08,624
What is this doing here?

922
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:11,790
Relax Samir... it's mine...

923
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:14,790
Relax... what do you mean relax...

924
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,832
why do you need a gun?

925
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,707
l don't feel safe here Samir.

926
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,999
lt's for my safety.

927
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,540
Safety? What are you
talking about Omar?

928
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:30,707
You wouldn't know
what l want to do...

929
01:05:31,791 --> 01:05:33,040
What?

930
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,290
Relax Sam... l still
ha?en't done anything...

931
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:38,582
What are you talking about Omar?

932
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:45,499
But yes... given a chance
l will go that way... once...

933
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:47,040
Have you gone crazy...

934
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:48,582
What are you guys doing?

935
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:51,290
l've been waiting for you...
dinner is ready...

936
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:54,457
Danyal's hungry and
l'm hungry... c'mon...

937
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,040
Get rid of this Omar.

938
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:07,915
l've hinted to him that
l want to be a terrorist...

939
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,290
yesterday l planted
that gun at his place...

940
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:12,499
he reacted like he's
ne?er seen a gun before.

941
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:15,457
Predictable...
he'll do exactly that...

942
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:20,540
Why? lf he is
operating a sleeper cell..

943
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:21,957
then wouldn't he say
something to me...

944
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,624
and even in his house there's
nothing remotely suspicious...

945
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:28,915
What do you think... he'd have
a jihad poster on his walls?

946
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:32,540
Have you met any of his friends yet?

947
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:34,165
What friends?

948
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,207
The ones whose
photographs l showed you...

949
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:40,040
No! that's exactly what l'm saying...
this is all nonsense...

950
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:44,665
Samir is not a terrorist...
please leave him alone... and me!

951
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:50,957
Do you think it's easy to
infiltrate a sleeper cell?

952
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,249
lf you were not his friend...

953
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:56,624
he wouldn't have let you
come even this close to him...

954
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:00,874
FBl has great
expectations from your friendship...

955
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,415
give one more push.

956
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:13,207
Thanks Bill. l'll send
you the memo tomorrow.

957
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:14,832
Let's go.

958
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,249
Thanks for coming Samir...
or l would have lost my way...

959
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,082
You're welcome... but why does your

960
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:23,874
company have a warehouse
at such a strange place?

961
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,290
Warehouses are
usually at such places...

962
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:28,582
just had to check it out once...

963
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,290
Omar l'm worried about you...

964
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:32,040
you talk about strange
things these days...

965
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:34,832
Hey man... you guys
want to buy some stuff?

966
01:07:34,916 --> 01:07:35,999
No... we are fine...

967
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:37,332
l've got some pure cocaine...

968
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:39,665
and l'll give you a
really good deal...

969
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,624
No... we are good... excuse us...

970
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:43,374
come.

971
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:46,457
l said take it man...

972
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:49,999
Okay... give me some...

973
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,415
What's up with you guys?

974
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,332
first you say you don't
want it then you say you do...

975
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:56,124
Nothing mister... l just want to

976
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:57,374
l want no trouble.

977
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:58,874
You are shady man.

978
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,749
Are you with the cops man... huh?
Are you with the cops?

979
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:01,957
No relax... l'm not...

980
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,082
c'mon gi?e me all

981
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,249
Ok... Ok...

982
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,082
Both of you...

983
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,665
Shit! Wha...

What the hell is wrong with you?

985
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:01,040
You killed him?

986
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,165
How long will we tolerate all this?

987
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,374
Tolerate what Omar?
He was a mugger...

988
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:07,915
But why did he only stop us?

989
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:11,499
Because... we were the only two
idiots there... don't you get it?

990
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:14,124
No Sam... it's not that simple...
l don't know man...

991
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,999
Are you out of your mind Omar?

992
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:25,332
Look Omar... l don't know
what you're up to...

993
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,290
or what you've gone through...

994
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:30,957
but l don't want this in my life...
l have a family...

995
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:34,540
Samir...

996
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,582
You'll have to leave my house...

997
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,790
Samir... what are you..
- Tomorrow.

998
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:44,457
l will explain to Maya that
you had to leave for training.

999
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:50,540
but you won't return after that...

1000
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:53,915
l don't want you in my life Omar.

1001
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,374
l don't want you.

1002
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,915
c'mon... c'mon... get up...

1003
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:30,207
O?er acting fool!

1004
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:41,957
c'mon run, run... Maya... ball...

1005
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:44,957
c'mon... c'mon...

1006
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,915
l did it...

1007
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:48,915
Ready?
- Ready...

1008
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:52,874
And it's a strike! You're out...

1009
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,790
No... but you were throwing so fast..

1010
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:58,999
and it went down before
l was close to the ball...

1011
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:00,624
it was like... you threw it...

1012
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,915
...and it went pfuuuu...
right under... - Okay...

1013
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:07,582
You know... in
college l always thought...

1014
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:10,707
you'd be the first
amongst us to get married.

1015
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,165
That could have happened had
l run after that villain...

1016
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:16,707
What?

1017
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:20,040
Don't you remember
that Hindi movie scene?

1018
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:21,665
No?

1019
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:25,249
The villain snatched the heroine's
bag... the hero chased him down...

1020
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,290
so the heroine went with the hero...

1021
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:30,582
and here l am...
still a secondary hero...

1022
01:11:32,291 --> 01:11:33,874
c'mon catch it...

1023
01:11:36,416 --> 01:11:38,999
No...

1024
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:44,915
No..

1025
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:54,124
Yesss...

1026
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:01,707
Hey l saw that... don't spoil him...

1027
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:03,874
Sorry to be a spoilsport Omar...

1028
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:06,665
it's time to leave for the airport...

1029
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:09,665

1033
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,499
Bye!

1034
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:20,832
Bye daddy!

1035
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:23,374
Bye daddy!
- Bye sweetheart. Bye

1036
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:09,790
What is this place Sam?

1037
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:33,249
That's Zaheer... from Pakistan...

1038
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,082
Malik... came via Germany

1039
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:57,249
Yaqub... a Bangladeshi...

1040
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:07,915
Yasir... Afghan...

1041
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,165
You know how close we've
come to our mission...

1042
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:29,874
why didn't you buy
the detonators from...

1043
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,999
who you were asked to buy them from?

1044
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:42,957
lf l give five hundred
thousand dollars to somebody...

1045
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:45,457
Then l keep track of
what he is doing.

1046
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:50,249
Who are these new suppliers?

1047
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:59,040
They're Russians...

1048
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:04,165
l'll return the money...

1049
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,290
l had to give it back to someone
or they would have killed me...

1050
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:12,040
l'll pay it back l swear...

1051
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,832

1053

Russian friends curious about us...

1054
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:24,957
they're asking about us
all over town.

1055
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,665
lsn't that dangerous?

1056
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:31,249
Samir... please don't do this..

1057
01:15:33,083 --> 01:15:35,790

1058
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:43,124

01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,665
Shoot him Omar.

1066
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,665
You wanted a chance right?

1067

How this all American dude like me..

1072

1073
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:17,582
Omar, 9/1 1 changed the world..

1074
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,290
So how could it spare me..?

1075
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:28,457
Ten days after 9/1 1 ..

1076
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,874
l was on my way to
meet Maya in Washington..

1077
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,249
Mr. Samir Sheikh..

1082
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:50,457
We're aware of your schedule sir..

1083
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,082
Where exactly are we going?

1084

Who are you? Give me
my clothes back!

1087
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:46,374
Did you take these pictures
in August?

1088
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:47,540
Screw you.. l'm not talking..

1089
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,290
Did you take these pictures
in August?

1090
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,249
How did you get these?
What's this about?

1091
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:53,290
What specific reason did you have..

1092
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,374
taking pictures of
the World Trade center?

1093
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,749
These are for my paper on
architecture at the university.

1094
01:19:57,833 --> 01:20:00,457
They're pretty specific photos for
a school paper.. don't you think?

1095
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02,499
They're supposed to be..

1096
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:05,457
And we'?e got you

on the 5th of September.. right?

1098
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:12,290
Yes.. that's for my cousin..
what does that ha?e to do with this?

1099
01:20:13,666 --> 01:20:17,540
Mr Sheikh.. we think you're a
suspect in a terrorist attack.

1100
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:20,832
What! Are you insane!
What rubbish is this?

1101
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,415
l want my lawyer..

1102
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:25,415
Answer what's being asked..

1103
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,707
You can't do that!

1104
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:32,624
Listen to me.. please understand..
l'm an American..

1105
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,207
l want my lawyer..

1106
01:20:34,708 --> 01:20:38,124
l want my lawyer..
l want my lawyer.. now!

1107
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:39,999
On the basis of some photographs...

1108
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,499
...l had clicked of
the World Trade centre..

1109
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:46,290
during college and one airline ticket
they tried to label me a terrorist..

1110
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:56,749
l never knew then..

1111
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:01,207
but the FBl had detained
1 200 people..

1112
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,249
like me and put them
in different jails..

1113
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:09,207
We had just one thing in common..

1114
01:21:10,541 --> 01:21:11,624
Our religion..

1115
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:29,249
Who did you take
these photographs for?

1116
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:30,415
l told you..

1117
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,165
ask my professor..

1118
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:35,624
Who did you take
these photographs for?

1119
01:21:40,208 --> 01:21:41,624
They would beat us..

1120
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:44,040
and scream at us..

1121
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:50,165
over and over again..

1122
01:21:57,458 --> 01:22:00,040
Listen to me.. this is a mistake..

1123
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,374
l'm an American..

1124
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:24,124
Leave the cloth on him
for the night.

1125
01:22:24,208 --> 01:22:27,290
No.. no.. don't leave me
like this.. take this off..

1126
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:31,290
take this off.. take
this off.. take this off..

1127
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:35,874
you bastard take this off..

1128
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:39,082
lt seemed we would
ne?er make it out of here..

1129
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:44,290
for months we lived in that
detention centre like animals..

1130
01:22:47,208 --> 01:22:51,207
Listen to me.. this is a mistake..

1131
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,915
Wake up.. here's your food..

1132
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:56,124
Don't you want to
fight for your dignity..?

1133
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,040
When you get out of here,
go to the Brooklyn market..

1134
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:04,624
and ask for New
York's best brown bread..

1135
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:12,665
Brooklyn market.. New York's
best brown bread.. remember this..

1136
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:14,207
Lights out.

1137
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:38,540
And finally.. nine months later..

1138
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:41,374
l was one of the four people..

1139
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:45,624
released by the FBl
for lack of evidence..

1140
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:15,999

1141
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:25,290
come.. walk along with me

1142
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:30,082
Why do you seem so frightened

1143
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:34,124
come.. walk along with me

1144
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:37,957
Why do you seem so frightened

1145
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,707
come let me hide you

1146
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:46,165
in my arms

1147
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:50,957
come let me build a dream

1148
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:54,540
in your eyes

1149
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:56,749
Now that l'm beside you

1150
01:27:56,833 --> 01:27:59,374
and l'm one with your soul

1151
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:02,957
l'll pick the agony from your way

1152
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,957
Every passing moment

1153
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,290
This love deepens even more

1154
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,915
What happened?

1155
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:40,249
Let's get married.

1156
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:41,415
What..?

1157
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:43,332
Will you marry me?

1158
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,082
No.. Maya.. what are you..

1159
01:28:45,166 --> 01:28:46,249
c'mon Sam

1160
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:49,290
This is the first time in history
that a girl is down on her knees...

1161
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:52,790
asking a boy.. please
don't spoil the moment..

1162
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:00,957
Why not..?

1163
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:03,874
Because l'm not the same person
that l used to be in college..

1164
01:29:03,958 --> 01:29:05,457
l don't care Samir..

1165
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:07,874
l will be viewed with
suspicion all my life..

1166
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:10,207
because of what happened to me.

1167
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:11,499
l don't care..

1168
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:13,540
l don't care.. what happens to me..

1169
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:15,624
as long as we're together..

1170
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:18,540
Don't stop as you walk along

1171
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:20,582
lf you are stopped tomorrow

1172
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:24,415
by the shadows of the past

1173
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,999
l'm with you always

1174
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:29,915
You are never alone

1175
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:33,290
ln your loneliness

1176
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:39,457
Don't stop as you walk along

1177
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:42,415
lf you are stopped tomorrow

1178
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,582
by the shadows of the past

1179
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:47,707
l'm with you always

1180
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:50,665
You are never alone

1181
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,582
ln your loneliness

1182
01:29:53,666 --> 01:29:55,665
Now that l'm beside you

1183
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:57,665
and l'm one with your soul

1184
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:01,790
l'll pick the agony from your way

1185
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:05,915
Every passing moment

1186
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:10,374
This love deepens even more

1187
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:14,290
come.. walk along with me

1188
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:18,832
Why do you seem so frightened

1189
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:22,582
come.. walk along with me

1190
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:26,749
Why do you seem so frightened

1191
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:31,707
come let me hide you

1192
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:35,124
in my arms

1193
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:39,957
come let me build a dream

1194
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:43,457
in your eyes

1195
01:30:43,541 --> 01:30:45,749
Now that l'm beside you

1196
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:47,749
and l'm one with your soul

1197
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:51,915
l'll pick the agony from your way

1198
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:56,207
Every passing moment

1199
01:30:56,291 --> 01:31:00,332
This love deepens even more

1200
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:02,457
Now that l'm beside you

1201
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:04,415
and l'm one with your soul

1202
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:08,582
l'll pick the agony from your way

1203
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:12,707
Every passing moment

1204
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:17,040
This love deepens even more

1205
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:39,582
Maya tried her best..

1206
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:42,957
but something had died inside me..

1207
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:45,957
l couldn't remember anything..

1208
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:49,082
couldn't concentrate on anything..

1209
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:52,332
l would tremble while speaking..

1210
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:54,999
l was good for nothing..

1211
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:58,624
l didn't know what to do?

1212
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:00,665
Alright.. and there you go.

1213
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:02,415
Hi can l help you..

1214
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,832
Hi.. can l have two
turkey sandwiches..

1215
01:32:03,916 --> 01:32:05,832
Sure.. would you like
white or brown bread?

1216
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:09,749
White or brown bread?

1217
01:32:09,916 --> 01:32:13,374
**When you get out of here, go to
the Brooklyn market and ask for..**

1218
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:16,374
New York's best brown bread..

1219
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:19,624
Don't you want to
fight for your dignity..?

1220
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:25,165
Brooklyn market and ask for
New York's best brown bread..

1221
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:28,665
Thank you..

1222
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:37,124
l want New York's best brown bread..

1223
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:40,915
3.45..

1224
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,332
Yes?

1225
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:31,082
l want New York's best brown bread..

1226
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:36,707
New York's best brown bread..

1227
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:39,040
3.45..

1228
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:54,957
Thank you..

1229
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:02,332
How much for this?

1230
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:09,457
But l went back..

1231
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:14,374
again and again..

1232
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:18,290
New York's best brown bread..

1233
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:19,665
3.45..

1234
01:35:21,458 --> 01:35:22,707
Thank you..

1235
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:25,290
New York's best brown bread..

1236
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:26,499
3.45..

1237
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:29,374
Thank you..

1238
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:32,040
New York's best brown bread..

1239
01:35:32,916 --> 01:35:33,999
3.45..

1240
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,749
New York's best brown bread..

1241
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:37,082
3.45..

1242
01:35:58,375 --> 01:35:59,749
Who told you about the bread?

1243
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:02,832
l was at the metropolitan detention
center and this old man was there.

1244
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:04,290
What old man?

1245
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:05,874
l don't know his name.

1246
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:08,832
He never spoke except once when
he told me about the brown bread..

1247
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:10,540
What took you so long to come?

1248
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:12,832
They kept asking me questions..

1249
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,207
and l kept answering them..

1250
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:19,832
l told them everything..
they had a different world..

1251
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:22,874
they had another motive..

1252
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,957
but they were giving me a
chance to fight for my dignity..

1253
01:36:28,208 --> 01:36:32,540
and that's what l was
looking for.. that's all l needed..

1254
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:40,957
l decided to tell Maya everything..

1255
01:36:42,416 --> 01:36:44,457
l had decided my course of action..

1256
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:47,665
and she was free to choose hers..

1257
01:36:48,958 --> 01:36:50,499
But when l got home..

1258
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:57,290
l'm pregnant. l'm so excited!

1259
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,124
That moment l decided at
that l will keep Maya..

1260
01:37:01,208 --> 01:37:04,082
and my child away from
this new world of mine..

1261
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:07,499
l became the Sam
from college for Maya..

1262
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:10,207
because Samir had
found his purpose..

1263
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:22,082
Yes Maya..

1264
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:29,582
No.. Omar's meeting got cancelled..
we're coming back together..

1265
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:34,957
Yes.. we're coming home.. okay bye..

1266
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:38,915
Maya doesn't know anything?

1267
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:42,582
She shouldn't either..

1268
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:48,957
But that guy Zilgai.. he was
with Maya.. is he with you as well?

1269
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,082
No.. he's just
employed in my company..

1270
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,540
he's extremely emotional..

1271
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:00,040
not quite the right man
for such work.

1272
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:04,457
c'mon let's go home..

1273
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:12,624
Shoot him.. l want my lawyer.. now!

1274
01:38:12,708 --> 01:38:15,207
Shoot him Omar..
they hit us all night..

1275
01:38:15,291 --> 01:38:18,540
how did he become a terrorist..
how can you do this to me..

1276
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:26,999
they kept shouting.. again
and again.. like animals..

1277
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:53,540
Why would you do that?

1278
01:38:53,958 --> 01:38:56,540
You are providing the
technical know-how and the workers..

1279
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:59,707
and you want just 30 per cent of
the profits. What's the catch?

1280
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:01,874
Let's just say l'm a man
in a hurry..

1281
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:05,499
l need to be at least 1 0 years old
in this business..

1282
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:07,415
to even qualify for the bidding..

1283
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,540
and l'm just 4 years
into this business.

1284
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:13,332
But your company has been
around for generations..

1285
01:39:13,583 --> 01:39:14,915
and you've got a clean reputation

1286
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:16,207
So l become your front?

1287
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:18,540
And make money and
bounce back Steve..

1288
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:20,374
let's face it.. the
recent accidents on..

1289
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:22,374
..your site haven't been
great for your business..

1290
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:24,415
you are on the verge of a shutdown..

1291
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,207
this is your chance to get back..

1292
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:30,374
You are not doing this to help
me out.. so what's the real deal?

1293
01:39:32,625 --> 01:39:34,999
These buildings are
prestigious Steve..

1294
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:37,540
they mean more than
money to me in the long run.

1295
01:39:37,916 --> 01:39:39,957
l pay 70 per cent of the costs..

1296
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:44,207
you keep 70 per cent of the profits..
can't get better than this.

1297
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:51,374
Okay Sam.. l'll call you.

1298
01:39:52,541 --> 01:39:54,624
You did the right
thing at the right time..

1299
01:39:55,541 --> 01:39:58,749
Right thing.. l killed a
man who l didn't even know..

1300
01:39:58,833 --> 01:39:59,915
how is that the right thing?

1301
01:39:59,958 --> 01:40:02,040
lf you hadn't.. his own
people would have killed him..

1302
01:40:02,125 --> 01:40:04,040
if they spared him.. we
would have killed him..

1303
01:40:04,125 --> 01:40:05,874
because had he been alive..

1304
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:08,540
he would have been responsible for
many deaths.. and you know this now.

1305
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:12,457
Why didn't you tell me that you
had detained Samir.. for 9 months?

1306
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:13,999
Because l didn't want you
to sympathise..

1307
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:15,749
..with Samir when you met him..

1308
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:18,540
because nothing..
nothing justifies terrorism.

1309
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:21,540
How easily you said that..

1310
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:25,415
do you ha?e any idea what
these guys went through?

1311
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:28,832
And after all that..
9 months later you tell them..

1312
01:40:28,916 --> 01:40:30,207
sorry kids..
we made a small mistake!

1313
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:31,374
lf someone commits a mistake..

1314
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:33,207
does that justify Samir
becoming a terrorist? ls it?

1315
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:34,749
After being tortured the
way they were in detention..

1316
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:37,540
no sane man can
remain what he used to be.

1317
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:39,290
Precisely..
that's what l'm saying..

1318
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,915
Samir was not a terrorist..

1319
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:43,999
but he is one now.

1320
01:40:44,916 --> 01:40:45,999
Yes..

1321
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:50,165
but it's you who have
made him a terrorist.

1322
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:54,665
Him and all the others..
ha?en't you?

1323
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,040
Omar.. l am a Muslim..

1324
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:06,999
and it hurts me to see
another Muslim go astray..

1325
01:41:08,833 --> 01:41:12,874
this clich has been repeated over
50 times that lslam favours peace..

1326
01:41:13,458 --> 01:41:17,957
but in reality if you favour lslam..
then you favour peace.

1327
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:21,832
Yes l agree that this country
has committed a lot of excesses..

1328
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:24,832
a lot of mistakes.. and we must take
responsibility for these faults..

1329
01:41:25,375 --> 01:41:28,749
but you cannot overlook the
positive values of this nation..

1330
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:32,749
l'm a Muslim and
yet l have been given

1331
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:35,374
responsibility for a
sensitive case like this.

1332
01:41:36,083 --> 01:41:37,957
That is only possible here..

1333
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:41,540
you shouldn't forget that we
arrived here as immigrants..

1334
01:41:41,625 --> 01:41:43,290
and now we have found a place here..

1335
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:45,332
we've got our freedom..

1336
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:50,040
and its to protect this
freedom that l'm doing all this..

1337
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:54,540
Omar.. we have come half way.

1338
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:56,957
This hostility towards Muslims..

1339
01:41:57,041 --> 01:41:58,749
that you sense in this
corner of the world..

1340
01:41:58,833 --> 01:42:00,499
or probably any
other part of the world..

1341
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,374
it's now up to a Muslim to transform

1342
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:04,582
that to sense of goodwill..

1343
01:42:07,041 --> 01:42:09,332
maybe you and l are
here to do just that..

1344
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:15,832
Alright.. is your crew ready?
- Yes..

1345
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:17,749
we'll get a third level
up on the scaffolding..

1346
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:19,749
get your guys working
on the brick today..

1347
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:22,540
there are those 20 windows
for you to do right over here..

1348
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:24,332
you guys can handle that today?

1349
01:42:26,541 --> 01:42:28,374
we need to scale it back down..

1350
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:30,124
otherwise we're going to
overshoot everything..

1351
01:42:30,208 --> 01:42:31,749
so dig up this foundation..

1352
01:42:31,833 --> 01:42:35,290
get back to work on
this section right here..

1353
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:25,540
Samir.. yes l'm done
with the meeting..

1354
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:29,124
l will see you in 40 minutes..
okay cool.. bye..

1355
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:35,665
Don't fail us..

1356
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:39,040
find out what is
their plan.. and when..

1357
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,290
l don't know what or when it is..

1358
01:43:43,291 --> 01:43:45,165
but l know Samir..

1359
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:49,624
whatever it is and
whenever it happens..

1360
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:52,457
it will shake up all of you..

1361
01:44:33,416 --> 01:44:34,915
Sam.. Steve here..

1362
01:44:34,958 --> 01:44:36,124
Hi Steve..

1363
01:44:36,541 --> 01:44:39,832
Listen.. l assume you heard
about the accident on my site today?

1364
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:41,749
Yes Steve.. l know
you're servicing those..

1365
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:43,749
important buildings very soon..

1366
01:44:43,958 --> 01:44:45,665
l'll send my workers across to you..

1367
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:48,915
Sam.. listen it's the only
opportunity l ha?e left..

1368
01:44:48,958 --> 01:44:50,207
l'm counting on you..

1369
01:44:50,291 --> 01:44:51,957
Trust me.. l won't let you down..

1370
01:44:53,291 --> 01:44:54,749
Ya and l'll give you
all the details of..

1371
01:44:54,833 --> 01:44:57,374
the workers for that
building's security clearance..

1372
01:44:57,583 --> 01:45:00,707
l'll personally supervise
the job.. See you soon..

1373
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:02,832
Who are you talking to..?

1374
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:05,040
l'll have to call you back..
ya.. thanks.. ya..

1375
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:09,415
Russians. They're saying that
Yaqub gave them two instead of three.

1376
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:12,082
Tell them they will get
the remaining money today..

1377
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,707
l want to meet them today..
do you understand..

1378
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:20,165
Show me your phones guys..
show me your phones..

1379
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,207
we've been planning
this for five years..

1380
01:45:22,291 --> 01:45:24,665
and now we're really
close to our objective..

1381
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:28,540
From now on l'll handle
all the dealings, you got it?

1382
01:45:29,041 --> 01:45:30,124
Omar..

1383
01:45:30,958 --> 01:45:32,207
your phone..

1384
01:45:35,666 --> 01:45:39,207
these phones are really dangerous..
anyone can locate us.

1385
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:46,124
l'll give you new
phone numbers tomorrow.

1386
01:45:58,208 --> 01:45:59,540
You got the money?

1387
01:45:59,833 --> 01:46:01,915
You said 300 thousand dollars

1388
01:46:02,458 --> 01:46:04,457
and my man gave you
that money in cash.

1389
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:06,207
Now you want more?

1390
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:09,332
Last week.. gas sold
for 4 dollar a gallon..

1391
01:46:09,375 --> 01:46:12,749
this week it's 4 dollars and a half..

1392
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:16,540
you still buy, don't you?
So prices change.

1393
01:46:16,625 --> 01:46:19,457
They told me.. you
guys are a dedicated lot..

1394
01:46:19,541 --> 01:46:22,540
you could spend any amount of
money to further your cause..

1395
01:46:22,625 --> 01:46:24,332
go to any extent.

1396
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:27,249
Yes.. you are right..
we can go to any extent.

1397
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:39,332
Don't shoot him!

1398
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,582
He will guide us to the detonators..

1399
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:06,957
How could l call you when
he had thrown away my phone?

1400
01:47:07,041 --> 01:47:09,040
And you told me not to
keep a record of your number..

1401
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:11,707
l have not sent you
there to sleep at night..

1402
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:15,874
if the police get a whiff
of what he did last night..

1403
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:20,207
then our whole operation is
finished.. we're finished.

1404
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:23,957
Why has he changed your phone..
what is he up to?

1405
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:25,165
l don't know..

1406
01:47:27,208 --> 01:47:31,499
Then please find out.. quickly..
and tell me..

1407
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:36,624
and don't call me with your new
phone.. Samir could be tracking it.

1408
01:47:37,291 --> 01:47:41,124
That's great.. you track my old
phone.. he tracks the new phone..

1409
01:47:41,208 --> 01:47:42,832
what the hell do l do
with these goddamn phones?

1410
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:58,082
This was a small example..

1411
01:47:58,708 --> 01:48:01,957
what we will deal with is
going to be way more powerful..

1412
01:48:03,166 --> 01:48:04,832
And executed just as easily.

1413
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:10,624
With this phone.. but how?

1414
01:48:10,875 --> 01:48:15,415
Exactly how l showed you Zaheer..
don't ask me dumb questions.

1415
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:21,457
These phones will be
used as detonators..

1416
01:48:21,541 --> 01:48:24,624
when c4 plastic
explosives are stuck on them..

1417
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:28,249
then l can trigger
these with my phone..

1418
01:48:28,958 --> 01:48:32,040
and this phone stays with me.

1419
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:33,874
But why?

1420
01:48:35,458 --> 01:48:37,749
But where and when?

1421
01:48:40,583 --> 01:48:42,582
You don't need to know
that right now.

1422
01:48:47,666 --> 01:48:50,374
Zilgai don't worry..
we'll take this case further..

1423
01:48:50,458 --> 01:48:52,124
they cannot deport you..

1424
01:48:52,833 --> 01:48:55,040
this is just a normal routine.

1425
01:48:55,666 --> 01:48:58,332
No Maya.. this is
neither normal.. nor routine..

1426
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:00,249
this is happening because
my skin colour is different..

1427
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:02,957
my face is different
and my name is different.

1428
01:49:03,041 --> 01:49:04,332
Don't be silly Zilgai..

1429
01:49:04,375 --> 01:49:06,957
all of you have developed
this persecution complex.

1430
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:11,165
l know they have been
wrong with you once..

1431
01:49:11,666 --> 01:49:14,582
but that doesn't mean
they are your enemies..

1432
01:49:15,791 --> 01:49:17,249
Those circumstances were difficult.

1433
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:19,624
Am l responsible if the
circumstances were difficult..

1434
01:49:20,791 --> 01:49:23,124
you are lucky
if you think that way..

1435
01:49:23,708 --> 01:49:28,832
but l have to live and
face this insult everyday.

1436
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,249
At times..

1437
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,915
l feel like..

1438
01:49:40,416 --> 01:49:42,749
Feel like what.. Zilgai?

1439
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:46,999
There come the bastards..
goddamn cops..

1440
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:48,832
to harass us.

1441
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,374
They won't do any such thing..
don't get excited..

1442
01:49:51,458 --> 01:49:53,415
Must be a routine check
or something.

1443
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:55,707
Why were you driving so fast?

1444
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:06,874
can l have your name please?

1445
01:50:07,041 --> 01:50:08,290
Mohammed Hanif Zilgai..

1446
01:50:08,375 --> 01:50:10,790
Father's name Latif
Mohammed Zilgai.. anything else?

1447
01:50:10,875 --> 01:50:12,790
License and registration
please sir..

1448
01:50:12,875 --> 01:50:15,249
Why officer...
we do no any mistake...

1449
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:17,374
Zilgai... just do as he says...

1450
01:50:17,458 --> 01:50:19,457
Maya.. l know the
worth of these bastards...

1451
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:21,957
Excuse me sir. Licence
and registration please...

1452
01:50:22,041 --> 01:50:23,707
Sorry officer... what's this about?

1453
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:26,624
l'm just doing my job ma'am...
you guys ran a traffic light...

1454
01:50:26,708 --> 01:50:29,249
Would really appreciate if your
friend here would just cooperate...

1455
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:30,749
Uh.. okay.. sure

1456
01:50:32,875 --> 01:50:34,207
Here.. take this..

1457
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:38,540
l told you.. they'll
harass us.. bastards.

1458
01:50:38,916 --> 01:50:40,999
Don't overreact Zilgai..
just shut up.

1459
01:50:42,875 --> 01:50:44,749
Sir.. would you please
step out of the car please..

1460
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:46,040
What's your problem now..
leave me alone..

1461
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:48,249
Out of the car and keep your
hands where l can see them.

1462
01:50:48,333 --> 01:50:49,874
Officer.. is this really necessary?

1463
01:50:49,958 --> 01:50:51,040
l think you are over reacting.

1464
01:50:51,125 --> 01:50:52,332
What the..!

1465
01:50:52,375 --> 01:50:54,332
Ma'am l advise you to stay
in the car.

1466
01:50:54,375 --> 01:50:55,624
Maya.. stay in the car..
l'm used to this..

1467
01:50:55,708 --> 01:50:58,624
Why are you used to it then?
Officer, is this really necessary?

1468
01:50:58,708 --> 01:51:00,332
Listen he doesn't
understand English!

1469
01:51:00,375 --> 01:51:03,207
That's fine.. turn around
face the car.. do it now!

1470
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:05,749
Why did you come out?

1471
01:51:05,833 --> 01:51:08,124
Shut up Zilgai.. now
let me do the talking..

1472
01:51:08,458 --> 01:51:09,624
just doing my job ma'am..

1473
01:51:09,708 --> 01:51:12,040
you had to go and turn
this whole thing around.

1474
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:22,915
She's clear..

1475
01:51:23,375 --> 01:51:25,207
can we go now officer.. please.

1476
01:51:31,625 --> 01:51:32,915
l'm sorry..

1477
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:20,332
Bye baby.
- Bye.

1478
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:23,124
Bye
- Bye..

1479
01:52:26,583 --> 01:52:28,249
Just a week after the
mayor had released..

1480
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:30,457
reports showing a decrease
in crime related incidents..

1481
01:52:30,541 --> 01:52:31,624
in downtown New York,

1482
01:52:31,708 --> 01:52:33,790
a police officer has
been murdered in the city.

1483
01:52:33,958 --> 01:52:35,457
ln a shocking incident,
a Sergeant..

1484
01:52:35,541 --> 01:52:37,707
of the New York Police
Department was found..

1485
01:52:37,791 --> 01:52:40,415
dead last night under
gruesome circumstances.

1486
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,290
Apparently his neck was broken.
The motive is unknown.

1487
01:52:44,041 --> 01:52:45,374
What happened Maya?

1488
01:52:46,416 --> 01:52:47,624
Omar..

1489
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:49,332
Oh God!

1490
01:52:51,333 --> 01:52:52,374
Zilgai!

1491
01:52:52,958 --> 01:52:54,790
The commissioner has promised
to track down the killer..

1492
01:52:54,875 --> 01:52:56,457
Within the next 48 hours.

1493
01:52:57,791 --> 01:52:58,874
What?

1494
01:53:00,541 --> 01:53:01,624
Zilgai!

1495
01:53:40,708 --> 01:53:41,874
Hey!

1496
01:53:45,708 --> 01:53:48,332
Get down on the ground!

1497
01:53:55,625 --> 01:53:56,874
Stop!

1498
01:53:57,958 --> 01:53:59,290
Freeze!

1499
01:54:03,333 --> 01:54:04,499
Get down!

1500
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:05,832
Down!

1501
01:54:13,875 --> 01:54:14,957
Stop!

1502
01:55:03,708 --> 01:55:06,249
Freeze.. He's over here..

1503
01:55:08,125 --> 01:55:10,957
Just relax..
get down on your knees..

1504
01:55:11,041 --> 01:55:13,582
Keep your hands where
we can see them.

1505
01:55:41,333 --> 01:55:42,874
Just relax..

1506
01:55:55,625 --> 01:55:57,624
No!!

1507
01:56:47,541 --> 01:56:52,040
How the hell did this happen?
Where's Maya?

1508
01:56:52,125 --> 01:56:55,957
She's at the police station..
for some questioning..

1509
01:56:57,875 --> 01:56:59,957
The mission is off.
- What?

1510
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:03,082
There's no other option..

1511
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:06,374
Zilgai was employed in
my maintenance company..

1512
01:57:06,416 --> 01:57:08,540
Maya was also
fighting his legal case..

1513
01:57:08,625 --> 01:57:12,165
would you want the police to
arrive here in their investigation..

1514
01:57:12,416 --> 01:57:14,165
while we're planting bombs..

1515
01:57:15,916 --> 01:57:17,874
it's risky to do
any such thing now..

1516
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:21,957
instead we'll begin
work on the new contract..

1517
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:24,124
of that building starting tomorrow.

1518
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:27,415
Mission cancelled!

1519
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:28,582
You're joking right..?

1520
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:30,249
Wrong.. it's me who
has become a joke..

1521
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:32,582
for days l've been
spying on my friends..

1522
01:57:32,666 --> 01:57:36,165
l've been lying to them..
l've even murdered a man..

1523
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:39,374
to uncover something that
will never be revealed now.

1524
01:57:39,708 --> 01:57:41,790
We've made a mistake
once by detaining him..

1525
01:57:42,041 --> 01:57:45,374
if we arrest him this time
without foolproof evidence..

1526
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:47,665
the human rights people
will create a huge scene..

1527
01:57:48,583 --> 01:57:50,999
that's why l need you
even more than before.

1528
01:57:51,625 --> 01:57:55,415
l think now Samir will wait.

1529
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,332
For what..?

1530
01:57:57,375 --> 01:57:59,374
For the NYPD to cool down..

1531
01:58:00,208 --> 01:58:02,290
this country has forgotten
even the Kennedy assassination..

1532
01:58:02,375 --> 01:58:03,915
this guy was just an ordinary cop..

1533
01:58:04,583 --> 01:58:08,957
and after that..
Samir will rise again.

1534
01:58:14,166 --> 01:58:15,624
Excuse me..

1535
01:58:18,208 --> 01:58:19,957
l'll pay the bill and come.

1536
01:58:39,375 --> 01:58:42,499
Omar.. Omaaar..

1537
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:51,415
Sorry Maya.. l'm in
an office meeting..

1538
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,832
l can' talk..

1539
01:59:21,875 --> 01:59:23,165
Taxi!

1540
01:59:45,541 --> 01:59:46,832
Maya?

1541
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:04,957
Who are you?

1542
02:00:07,708 --> 02:00:08,915
You scared me Maya..

1543
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,207
Who are you..?

1544
02:00:10,291 --> 02:00:12,582
Maya.. you know who l am..
give me the gun..

1545
02:00:12,666 --> 02:00:14,540
Are you here to hurt Samir..?

1546
02:00:14,875 --> 02:00:16,665
Why would l hurt him?

1547
02:00:16,916 --> 02:00:19,249
What will l achieve by
doing that? Sam is my friend.

1548
02:00:19,333 --> 02:00:22,374
Omar.. stop it! Stop pretending.

1549
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:27,540
We both know who Sam is
and what he does.

1550
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:30,957
What..?

1551
02:00:31,041 --> 02:00:35,707
Yes Omar..
l know what Samir is doing..

1552
02:00:38,083 --> 02:00:39,540
Does he know that you know this?

1553
02:00:39,625 --> 02:00:41,582
No.. answer me first.

1554
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:45,082
Why did you lie that you
were not on the 20th street..

1555
02:00:45,166 --> 02:00:48,624
who was that man with you..
he's with the cops right?

1556
02:00:48,875 --> 02:00:51,540
l saw him at
Zilgai's accident site too..

1557
02:00:52,458 --> 02:00:54,082
Maya listen..

1558
02:00:54,166 --> 02:00:56,499
What do you want to do to Samir?

1559
02:01:00,041 --> 02:01:04,207
Maya.. first let's get out of here..
l'll tell you everything..

1560
02:01:04,291 --> 02:01:06,957
No.. tell me now..

1561
02:01:07,041 --> 02:01:08,415
Maya.. do you honestly
belie?e that..

1562
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:10,957
l will let anything
happen to you or Sam?

1563
02:01:11,041 --> 02:01:14,249
No.. let's get out of here and
l will tell you everything..

1564
02:01:14,333 --> 02:01:16,957
Maya l promise you..
You can't do this to me..

1565
02:01:17,041 --> 02:01:18,665
Please.. l beg of you..

1566
02:01:18,750 --> 02:01:20,290
Please put the gun down..

1567
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:23,874
please..

1568
02:01:23,958 --> 02:01:25,457
You have to trust me Maya..

1569
02:01:27,583 --> 02:01:30,415
lf you knew.. then why
didn't you stop him?

1570
02:01:30,666 --> 02:01:32,832
Because Samir didn't tell me..

1571
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,374
l found out.

1572
02:01:34,958 --> 02:01:39,999
l always felt that if he's
not sharing it with me..

1573
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:43,832
then he'll give it up
one day and come back..

1574
02:01:47,166 --> 02:01:53,207
each day l lived with the
fear that he would tell me..

1575
02:01:54,416 --> 02:01:56,915
because as long as he hides it..

1576
02:01:57,958 --> 02:02:00,999
l have a hope that he
will one day leave it all..

1577
02:02:02,375 --> 02:02:04,749
and that's the hope that
l have been living on..

1578
02:02:05,458 --> 02:02:07,582
and l can do anything for it.

1579
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,332
Then help me Maya..
we can bring him back.

1580
02:02:11,375 --> 02:02:12,790
How can l help you?

1581
02:02:12,875 --> 02:02:18,582
You work for the FBl, the same people
who stripped Samir of his dignity.

1582
02:02:18,666 --> 02:02:22,249
Please Maya.. Samir has aborted his
operation after Zilgai's incident..

1583
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:24,665
this is our only chance..
We can get him off this track..

1584
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:25,874
Maya.. trust me.. please.

1585
02:02:25,958 --> 02:02:27,290
How can l trust you?

1586
02:02:27,791 --> 02:02:29,374
Why should l trust you..?

1587
02:02:33,375 --> 02:02:34,707
Because.. l..

1588
02:02:40,916 --> 02:02:43,374
you know how l feel about you..

1589
02:02:44,416 --> 02:02:47,374
and l don't want anything
to happen to you or Samir..

1590
02:02:47,958 --> 02:02:51,207
Maya.. please trust me..
l'm here to help Samir..

1591
02:02:52,083 --> 02:02:53,415
Please trust me..

1592
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:56,165
Help me.

1593
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:05,874
l need a guarantee.. in writing..
from the FBl..

1594
02:03:06,541 --> 02:03:08,707
that they won't kill Samir.

1595
02:03:11,875 --> 02:03:13,624
How could you tell his wife?

1596
02:03:14,125 --> 02:03:17,374
What kind of undercover operation
is this.. undercover from who?

1597
02:03:17,458 --> 02:03:19,999
The only people who don't seem to
know what's going on here is us..!

1598
02:03:20,083 --> 02:03:21,707
Gibson.. he had to tell her..

1599
02:03:21,791 --> 02:03:24,040
And now you want
amnesty for this terrorist?

1600
02:03:24,125 --> 02:03:25,790
When he's called off the
attack he was planning..

1601
02:03:25,875 --> 02:03:26,957
FBl can't kill him for nothing..

1602
02:03:27,041 --> 02:03:30,624
Look sonny.. you don't tell me
what FBl can and cannot do..

1603
02:03:30,708 --> 02:03:32,374
That's the problem with you

1604
02:03:32,458 --> 02:03:35,040
Americans.. you just don't listen to
anyone.. What's he saying? - Nothing..

1605
02:03:35,125 --> 02:03:37,957
You have my personal guarantee..
you will get that letter..

1606
02:03:38,041 --> 02:03:40,707
but Maya will have to come to the
FBl office tomorrow to meet me..

1607
02:03:40,791 --> 02:03:42,957
Look Roshan.. you better
know what you're doing..

1608
02:03:43,041 --> 02:03:46,582
Ya.. she's coming to meet us.. ya..

1609
02:03:47,041 --> 02:03:50,665
Okay.. happy..?

1610
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,915
l don't trust this man..

1611
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:59,665
Okay.. and now let's see how much
you can eat.. wow.. you like it..

1612
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:05,290
see this.. ya.. c'mon c'mon..
suck it in..

1613
02:04:19,708 --> 02:04:22,332
lt's okay Maya.. it's okay..

1614
02:04:24,625 --> 02:04:25,874
Don't worry.

1615
02:04:30,208 --> 02:04:31,415
Poor Zilgai..

1616
02:04:32,375 --> 02:04:33,874
couldn't handle the pressure..

1617
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:35,124
Ya..

1618
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:38,457
Where's Omar?

1619
02:04:39,458 --> 02:04:40,540
l don't know..

1620
02:04:40,625 --> 02:04:43,040
Dad made me pasta mamma..

1621
02:04:44,875 --> 02:04:46,415
He loves his pasta.

1622
02:04:51,375 --> 02:04:53,624
Hey.. there you are..
where were you?

1623
02:04:53,708 --> 02:04:57,749
Ya.. l went to the police
to find out about Zilgai..

1624
02:04:58,083 --> 02:04:59,582
And what did they say?

1625
02:05:00,791 --> 02:05:02,374
lt's an open and shut case for them..

1626
02:05:02,458 --> 02:05:07,540
a frustrated illegal immigrant commits
murder in a moment of madness..

1627
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:08,957
that's just about it..

1628
02:05:09,041 --> 02:05:10,665
Okay.. Danny.. time to sleep..

1629
02:05:11,375 --> 02:05:12,915
Night-night mamma..

1630
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,624
Mommy is coming in 5 minutes.

1631
02:05:14,708 --> 02:05:17,374
That's the aeroplane..

1632
02:05:19,791 --> 02:05:20,957
Say goodnight..

1633
02:05:21,041 --> 02:05:22,540
Goodnight Danyal..
- Night-Night mamma.

1634
02:05:22,625 --> 02:05:24,082
Good night my lo?e..

1635
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:32,040
Maya you will have to
go to the FBl office..

1636
02:05:32,125 --> 02:05:33,624
tomorrow to meet their
senior officers.. okay

1637
02:05:33,708 --> 02:05:34,832
Why?

1638
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:37,582
Maya they want to meet you
before giving the guarantee letter..

1639
02:05:39,250 --> 02:05:43,290
Samir has cancelled the mission..
this is our only chance..

1640
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:51,290
we can show him the letter.. maybe
he gives it all up when he sees it..

1641
02:05:52,625 --> 02:05:54,332
Maya.. did Samir tell you about..

1642
02:05:54,375 --> 02:05:57,082
the new project that
we're starting tomorrow..

1643
02:05:57,166 --> 02:05:58,540
Really?
- Ya.

1644
02:05:58,625 --> 02:06:00,040
That's great.

1645
02:06:00,125 --> 02:06:01,707
l'm really excited about it..

1646
02:06:02,458 --> 02:06:05,790
for a new project..
for a new beginning..

1647
02:06:05,875 --> 02:06:07,790
That's true..
- cheers!

1648
02:06:07,875 --> 02:06:09,332
a new beginning.

1649
02:06:42,041 --> 02:06:43,082
Morning..
- How you doing?

1650
02:06:43,166 --> 02:06:44,332
Good.
- Alright..

1651
02:06:49,291 --> 02:06:50,874
Hello Steve. Hey it's William..

1652
02:06:51,125 --> 02:06:52,874
are you sending up
any new guys today?

1653
02:06:53,416 --> 02:06:55,374
Okay.. okay.. thank you.

1654
02:07:01,083 --> 02:07:02,332
Go ahead..

1655
02:07:22,041 --> 02:07:24,040
This is what makes our
company special Omar..

1656
02:07:24,125 --> 02:07:26,499
we clean everything from
the roof to the sewer..

1657
02:07:36,958 --> 02:07:38,124
Morning

1658
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:41,415
She has to understand this..

1659
02:07:42,541 --> 02:07:43,624
She's here..

1660
02:07:46,458 --> 02:07:47,874
Hi Maya.. l'm Roshan

1661
02:07:48,333 --> 02:07:50,582
lt was you that day.. with Omar.

1662
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:52,540
Ya.. it was me..

1663
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:04,374
Eric.. Danny.. you guys take
that side. We will take the front.

1664
02:08:13,125 --> 02:08:15,707
This is it.. the main
drainage pipe of this building..

1665
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:19,374
You're sure..?

1666
02:08:21,291 --> 02:08:22,624
We'll know soon..

1667
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:58,082
What's that? - This brush basically
cleans up all blockages in the pipe..

1668
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:14,374
But.. so far he's done nothing
that makes him a terrorist..

1669
02:09:14,875 --> 02:09:16,707
and it's possible that he
may never do any such thing..

1670
02:09:16,791 --> 02:09:18,624
you're just assuming
that he is up to something.

1671
02:09:18,708 --> 02:09:21,374
Had it been just an assumption
l wouldn't have called you here..

1672
02:09:21,875 --> 02:09:23,624
lt's more than a guess, Maya.

1673
02:09:25,041 --> 02:09:27,332
That's why we need your help..

1674
02:09:27,375 --> 02:09:35,249
l'm ready to help.. but l need a
guarantee that you won't kill Samir..

1675
02:09:35,666 --> 02:09:37,249
l'm prepared to give
you that guarantee..

1676
02:09:41,625 --> 02:09:42,749
What was that Zaheer..?

1677
02:09:42,833 --> 02:09:45,040
You get the letter.. l'll sign it..

1678
02:09:45,208 --> 02:09:46,332
Alright..

1679
02:10:04,208 --> 02:10:07,665
Samir is a genius.. that's a brilliant
way to send up c4 explosi?es..

1680
02:10:07,958 --> 02:10:09,124
What does that mean..?

1681
02:10:09,208 --> 02:10:11,457
That means.. that the
plan was never cancelled.

1682
02:10:12,708 --> 02:10:13,915
What building is it?

1683
02:10:14,416 --> 02:10:15,915
That, only God knows..

1684
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,874
No, l need to know
which building it is.

1685
02:10:19,916 --> 02:10:21,124
Stop..

1686
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:13,082
Ya..
- Samir is doing something today..

1687
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:15,457
there's a bomb planted in
a building somewhere here..

1688
02:11:21,875 --> 02:11:26,374
Hello.. Omar.. hello..

1689
02:11:41,958 --> 02:11:44,374
Hello.. hello..

1690
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:48,457
Hello..
- Yes..

1691
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:50,624
What building is it? - l don't know
which building it is...

1692
02:11:50,708 --> 02:11:52,957
but there's a bomb planted
in a building here somewhere..

1693
02:13:32,958 --> 02:13:34,165
Hello.
- Omar..

1694
02:13:34,250 --> 02:13:36,165
Yes Maya..
- l saw Samir here...

1695
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:37,374
What?

1696
02:13:37,875 --> 02:13:40,582
Where did you see him?
- At the FBl building...

1697
02:13:41,541 --> 02:13:42,665
What!!

1698
02:13:43,333 --> 02:13:45,332
Omar.. hello?

1699
02:14:00,333 --> 02:14:02,540
c'mon Omar.. tell me.. tell me..

1700
02:14:02,625 --> 02:14:04,374
l know which building it is.

1701
02:14:05,416 --> 02:14:07,040
Sir! Sir.. stand back..

1702
02:14:07,125 --> 02:14:08,582
l need to meet agent Roshan..

1703
02:14:08,958 --> 02:14:10,874
Tell your guards to let me in first..

1704
02:14:10,958 --> 02:14:12,290
We don't have time.. tell me quick!

1705
02:14:12,375 --> 02:14:13,707
l just need to meet him
for a minute..

1706
02:14:13,791 --> 02:14:14,874
What is he saying?

1707
02:14:14,958 --> 02:14:16,040
Let me in first..

1708
02:14:16,125 --> 02:14:17,499
l don't have time.. tell me..

1709
02:14:17,958 --> 02:14:19,624
FBl Headquarters!

1710
02:14:19,708 --> 02:14:21,499
All of you are sitting on the bomb!

1711
02:14:23,708 --> 02:14:24,957
We are the target!

1712
02:14:25,041 --> 02:14:26,249
What?

1713
02:14:27,458 --> 02:14:29,707
We have to evacuate.. now!

1714
02:14:30,041 --> 02:14:33,332
Move! Move! Go.. go!

1715
02:14:38,541 --> 02:14:40,124
How do you know it's this building?

1716
02:14:40,250 --> 02:14:41,874
Because Samir is in this building..

1717
02:14:41,958 --> 02:14:43,374
he's cleaning your windows.

1718
02:14:43,416 --> 02:14:46,582
And he's using the same
phone bomb l told you about..

1719
02:14:51,541 --> 02:14:53,499
Send snipers.. we'll shoot
him before he blows us..

1720
02:14:53,583 --> 02:14:55,290
Shut up Gibson!

1721
02:14:55,875 --> 02:14:59,790
l can stop Samir.. if you give me
a chance to speak to him please..

1722
02:14:59,875 --> 02:15:00,957
Why will he listen to you..

1723
02:15:01,041 --> 02:15:02,957
Because he doesn't know
that Maya is also here...

1724
02:15:03,041 --> 02:15:05,082
maybe if l tell him
that he will believe me..

1725
02:15:05,166 --> 02:15:06,624
..please don't waste time..

1726
02:15:06,708 --> 02:15:08,415
Okay.. let's go.. come on..

1727
02:15:16,250 --> 02:15:17,332
Move it!

1728
02:15:22,291 --> 02:15:23,374
Sam..

1729
02:15:24,958 --> 02:15:26,040
Omar..

1730
02:15:26,125 --> 02:15:27,540
You can't press that trigger Samir..

1731
02:15:27,625 --> 02:15:28,957
What are you doing here?

1732
02:15:29,041 --> 02:15:33,249
Sam.. l am an undercover FBl agent..

1733
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:37,624
What?
- l will explain everything...

1734
02:15:37,708 --> 02:15:41,332
just give me the trigger..
we don't have much time..

1735
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:54,082
What happened to you before won't
happen again.. please trust me..

1736
02:15:54,250 --> 02:15:55,374
Trust you?

1737
02:15:55,916 --> 02:16:00,249
l could have planted these bombs
anywhere Omar.. on any soft target..

1738
02:16:00,333 --> 02:16:02,582
l need the choppers
in here right now..

1739
02:16:02,958 --> 02:16:05,874
l need the snipers
in here.. let's move!

1740
02:16:05,958 --> 02:16:08,374
But my fight is with the FBl..

1741
02:16:09,208 --> 02:16:11,499
so that they think
twice before labeling..

1742
02:16:11,583 --> 02:16:13,374
..just about anyone a terrorist..

1743
02:16:17,291 --> 02:16:18,915
How will that help Sam?

1744
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,540
You'll blow this building up..

1745
02:16:21,958 --> 02:16:26,040
and they will detain ten more
Samir Sheikhs in that investigation..

1746
02:16:26,125 --> 02:16:28,874
and they will undergo
exactly what you went through..

1747
02:16:28,958 --> 02:16:32,249
this will never end Sam.

1748
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,374
What did you do Omar?

1749
02:16:56,416 --> 02:17:00,165
Sam.. give me the trigger..
l promise you nothing will happen..

1750
02:17:00,250 --> 02:17:02,499
Yes Omar.. nothing will happen..

1751
02:17:03,083 --> 02:17:05,874
but only till the time
that l have this trigger..

1752
02:17:06,625 --> 02:17:09,082
they know if they shoot me..

1753
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:11,624
l will press the trigger.

1754
02:17:12,750 --> 02:17:16,374
you screwed it all up Omar..
you screwed it all up.

1755
02:17:16,458 --> 02:17:19,040
No Sam.. l have a letter..

1756
02:17:19,125 --> 02:17:23,499
Yes.. and these are your postmen..

1757
02:17:25,333 --> 02:17:29,582
don't be stupid Omar..
you know how this will end.

1758
02:17:35,250 --> 02:17:37,374
Sam you can't press the trigger..

1759
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:39,165
l promise nothing will happen Sam..

1760
02:17:39,250 --> 02:17:41,124
Maya is in this building Sam..

1761
02:18:13,833 --> 02:18:16,374
Sam..

1762
02:18:17,833 --> 02:18:19,415
Give me that trigger..

1763
02:18:20,083 --> 02:18:25,332

it is.. we'll make it alright..

1764
02:18:25,375 --> 02:18:28,082

1765
02:18:28,833 --> 02:18:32,457
please.. l promise nothing is going
to happen.. give me the trigger..

1766
02:18:34,291 --> 02:18:37,165
l kept you away from this
world for so many years..

1767
02:18:37,875 --> 02:18:43,374
only to be able to come back
everyday to you and Danyal..

1768
02:18:43,541 --> 02:18:47,249

Just come back.. just
leave this.. please..

1771
02:18:53,041 --> 02:18:56,832
That's what l wanted Maya..
to come back home for good..

1772
02:18:58,375 --> 02:19:03,082
to you.. l didn't want you to know..

1773
02:19:03,250 --> 02:19:05,707
Sam you haven't done
anything so far..

1774
02:19:05,791 --> 02:19:08,415
Sam listen to me..
look at me.. look at me.

1775
02:19:09,250 --> 02:19:10,415
No Maya..

1776
02:19:12,375 --> 02:19:14,165
there's nothing left for me now..

1777
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:17,332
Nothing's over baby..
nothing's over.. please..

1778
02:19:17,375 --> 02:19:20,707
just leave this.. all
of this.. listen to me..

1779
02:19:21,083 --> 02:19:23,082
Danyal needs you..

1780
02:19:24,708 --> 02:19:28,665

1781
02:19:30,458 --> 02:19:31,832

1782
02:19:34,166 --> 02:19:35,415
l love you..

1783
02:19:47,375 --> 02:19:48,707
Sam..

1784
02:19:51,333 --> 02:20:07,749
Sam!

1785
02:20:23,375 --> 02:20:25,040
Fire!

1786
02:20:25,541 --> 02:20:34,915
No!

1787
02:22:19,416 --> 02:22:22,874
That jersey no 3.. your
son plays like a real pro!

1788
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:24,624
Man!

1789
02:22:25,250 --> 02:22:26,374
Thank you.

1790
02:22:46,250 --> 02:22:47,332
Safe!

1791
02:22:56,958 --> 02:22:58,707
For how long will
you not speak to me?

1792
02:23:03,875 --> 02:23:09,374
congratulations.. l read in the
papers.. you got a commendation..

1793
02:23:12,958 --> 02:23:15,249
Omar.. it's not me or
you that killed Samir..

1794
02:23:16,750 --> 02:23:19,165
the path that Samir chose is
responsible for his death..

1795
02:23:21,500 --> 02:23:25,957
And Maya..? What was her fault?

1796
02:23:26,041 --> 02:23:27,540
No one was at fault Omar..

1797
02:23:28,083 --> 02:23:29,624
everyone was right
where they were..

1798
02:23:31,333 --> 02:23:32,832
its just that the time
was not right.

1799
02:23:34,708 --> 02:23:38,499
And in such times people make
wrong choices and so do countries..

1800
02:23:38,958 --> 02:23:41,415
Both suffer, the
people and the country.

1801
02:23:42,458 --> 02:23:43,749
That's what happened.

1802
02:24:28,541 --> 02:24:31,999
What did we get out of this
undercover operation of yours?

1803
02:24:34,208 --> 02:24:35,999
Two of my friends end up dead..

1804
02:24:36,875 --> 02:24:40,790
and you get a medal. What else?

1805
02:24:42,416 --> 02:24:47,499
The day you have an answer
to this is the day we'll talk.

1806
02:24:50,541 --> 02:24:52,707
The answer is in front of you..

1807
02:24:57,375 --> 02:24:59,874
A Muslim boy whose
father was a terrorist..

1808
02:25:00,125 --> 02:25:01,957
is playing in an American team..

1809
02:25:02,625 --> 02:25:05,499
and they're hailing him as a hero..

1810
02:25:06,208 --> 02:25:09,749
that's what we got..
that's what we achieved.

1811
02:25:13,541 --> 02:25:15,624
This is a new generation Omar..

1812
02:25:15,708 --> 02:25:17,832
it's come away from
the memories of 2001 ..

1813
02:25:18,416 --> 02:25:20,999
and l think we should also move on..

1814
02:25:22,916 --> 02:25:24,457
it's high time.

1815
02:25:31,583 --> 02:25:33,665
l told you.. l'm the champ!

1816
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:35,749
Yes champ.. you are the champ.
Give me a five..

1817
02:25:35,958 --> 02:25:37,207
Who's that?

1818
02:25:42,875 --> 02:25:44,207
He's an old friend.

1819
02:25:44,291 --> 02:25:46,874
Who.. your friend or Papa's friend?

1820
02:25:48,958 --> 02:25:52,249
Well.. let's say..
l'm your friend champ..

1821
02:25:52,416 --> 02:25:53,582
High five?

1822
02:25:55,791 --> 02:25:57,040
Are you hungry champ?

1823
02:25:57,583 --> 02:25:58,874
Yeah.. let's go..

1824
02:25:58,958 --> 02:26:00,249
Alright let's go then..

1825
02:26:00,333 --> 02:26:02,124
Aren't you coming?

1826
02:26:10,791 --> 02:26:12,499
Of course Danyal.. he is coming..

1827
02:26:12,583 --> 02:26:14,165
Great.. lets go..

1828
02:26:14,458 --> 02:26:15,915
Do you like Pasta?

1829
02:26:16,375 --> 02:26:18,499
What baby?
- Do you like pasta?

1830
02:26:22,208 --> 02:26:23,624
Yeah..

1831
02:26:24,375 --> 02:26:26,165

1832
02:26:28,625 --> 02:26:29,874
