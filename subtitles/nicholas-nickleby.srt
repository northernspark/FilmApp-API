2
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:39,181
What happens when the light first pierces...

3
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:41,921
the dark dampness
in which we have waited?

4
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,103
We are slapped and cut loose.

5
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,385
If we are lucky,
someone is there to catch us...

6
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:53,906
and persuade us that we are safe.

7
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:57,989
But are we safe?

8
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:01,396
What happens if, too early,
we lose a parent?

9
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:06,483
That party on whom we rely
for only everything?

10
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:11,675
Why, we are cut loose again...

11
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:14,642
and we wonder, even dread...

12
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,543
whose hands will catch us now.

13
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:25,272
There once lived a man
named Nicholas Nickleby.

14
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:28,082
Unambitious in business...

15
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,159
he devoted himself
to the happiness of his family.

16
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,266
But he is not the Nicholas Nickleby
you have come to hear about.

17
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:37,629
That Nicholas Nickleby is here.

18
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:03,136
The most important journey of your life...

19
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:05,455
will be to find her.

20
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:08,409
Nicholas had a younger sister, Kate.

21
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:10,682
Here she is again.

22
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:12,591
And here.

23
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:14,955
Goodness, how it goes.

24
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,727
For their father,
these children were a divine burden.

25
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:22,182
Never had money meant less to him...

26
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:24,955
and never had he needed it more.

27
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:27,682
His wife said:

28
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:28,818
Speculate.

29
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:32,727
Since it was well known
that Mr. Nickleby's brother, Ralph...

30
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:34,318
many years his senior...

31
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:37,545
had made his fortune in London
by just this method...

32
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:42,545
so Nicholas Nickleby,
who had never speculated...

33
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,000
speculated.

34
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:48,136
It is a particular sort of triumph...

35
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:51,409
that bankers
have made the word "speculation"...

36
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:53,455
synonymous with "adventure"...

37
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:57,045
when, indeed, it means only
that one may gain a great deal...

38
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:59,318
or one may lose a great deal.

39
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:02,818
Alas, for Mr. Nickleby, it meant the latter.

40
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:07,955
Four stockbrokers
took villa residences in Italy...

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,682
and 400 nobodies were ruined.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,318
Eliminating all he had saved...

43
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:16,955
as well as any wish to earn it again...

44
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,318
Mr. Nickleby took to his bed...

45
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:23,136
until he surrendered
to the one certainty of life...

46
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:27,000
which no amount of speculation
can prevent.

47
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:29,409
What shall we do?

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,409
Here is Nicholas Nickleby again.

49
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,045
19 years old...

50
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:53,318
and head of his family.

51
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,318
Come here.

52
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:16,136
Said he would join me at the tavern.

53
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,000
Turnips and carrots!

54
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,727
Mind your back, miss.

55
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,727
Please, Mr. Nickleby, do you wish my father
to go to debtor's prison?

56
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,955
Where your father sleeps, Miss Bray,
is of no concern to me.

57
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,409
Father tells me the interest
is what makes the debt so unmanageable.

58
00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:06,182
- Could you not stop it?
- Tell him...

59
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:10,136
to repay the loan.
That will stop the interest right away.

60
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:30,136
You must bear up against sorrow, ma'am.

61
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,545
I always do.

62
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,409
Mine was no common loss.

63
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,182
It was no uncommon loss.

64
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:40,273
Husbands die every day.

65
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,727
And wives.

66
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:44,409
Brothers also.

67
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:46,545
Yes, and puppies, too.

68
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:50,682
Ma'am, you did not mention
what my brother's complaint was.

69
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:54,136
We feel he died of a broken heart.

70
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:56,182
Pooh, there's no such thing.

71
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,273
Indeed, if you have no heart to break.

72
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:03,273
In your letter, you said
the creditors had administered...

73
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:04,955
and nothing was left for you?

74
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:06,864
We tried to sell the house...

75
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:09,545
but no one seemed to want
a little home like ours.

76
00:08:09,682 --> 00:08:12,864
So you spent what little remained
coming all the way to London...

77
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,136
to see what I could do for you?

78
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:18,318
It was your brother's dying wish...

79
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:20,727
that you might do something
for his children.

80
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:23,409
How is it, when a man dies
without property of his own...

81
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,682
he thinks he has the right
to dispose of others'?

82
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:28,136
What a feckless, inconsiderate man.

83
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:31,045
Our father, your brother, had a noble heart.

84
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:32,955
Which beats no more.

85
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:35,591
You, girl...

86
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:38,682
you haven't been brought up
too delicately...

87
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,409
to apprentice at some boarding school,
have you?

88
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:42,318
Uncle...

89
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,273
I will try to do anything
to gain me a home and bread.

90
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:53,545
Now that I think of it, I know a dressmaker
who may have some work.

91
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,545
You, boy, have you ever done anything?

92
00:08:58,545 --> 00:08:59,591
No.

93
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:02,182
Noggs, where's the morning paper
I left on my desk?

94
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,000
- On my desk.
- Bring it to me.

95
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:05,682
"Bring it to me."

96
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:07,045
Stop parroting me.

97
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,591
I wish I was a parrot. I'd fly away.

98
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,818
I wish you were a parrot, too.
I'd wring your neck.

99
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:15,864
- Read that.
- What is it, Nicholas?

100
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,818
An advertisement.

101
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:21,591
"Education at
Mr. Wackford Squeers' Academy."

102
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,727
Oh, no.

103
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:31,136
"Dotheboys Hall, at the delightful village
of Dotheboys, in Yorkshire.

104
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:33,591
"Youth are clothed, boarded and booked...

105
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,955
"instructed in all languages,

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,409
"mathematics, orthography,
the use of globes and single stick.

107
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:43,045
"Diet unparalleled.
An able assistant wanted.

108
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:45,455
"Annual salary £5.

109
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:47,591
"Master of Arts preferred."

110
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:51,318
I'm not a Master of Arts.

111
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,682
That can be got over, I believe.

112
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,591
But it is such a long way off.

113
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:59,864
If I am fortunate enough to be appointed,
what will become of those I leave behind?

114
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:03,136
It will be my immediate care
to place your mother and sister...

115
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:06,318
in some sphere of life
in which they may become independent.

116
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,409
I will not forget what you have done
for me this day, Uncle.

117
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,545
Nor shall I.

118
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:23,955
Any chimneys to sweep?

119
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:28,864
There he is. He's the man with one eye.

120
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,864
Though the popular prejudice
runs in favor of two.

121
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,545
- Is this one inch milk and the rest water?
- Aye, sir.

122
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:38,864
Here's richness.

123
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:41,318
When I say "one," you may take a drink.

124
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:44,045
When I say "number two,"
the boy next to you may take it...

125
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:47,409
and so on, till all five boys
have been nourished.

126
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:50,818
But work fast.
We leave when the coach horn blows.

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,182
Number one.

128
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:53,955
Number two.

129
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,273
Number three.

130
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:58,682
Number four.

131
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,273
Number five.

132
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:03,545
Out you go.

133
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:08,318
Subdue your appetites,
and you've conquered human nature.

134
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,545
Yorkshire coach leaves in five minutes!

135
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:13,727
Wait by the coach in a straight line.

136
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:16,955
Squeers, this is the boy I told you about.
My nephew.

137
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:20,136
I am most grateful for the opportunity
to serve, sir.

138
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:22,182
- Mr. Squeers.
- Mrs. Shaygar.

139
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:25,409
Could you give those to Henry?
Tuesday is his birthday.

140
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:28,864
Delighted, my dear.
The boy's happiness is our prime concern.

141
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,273
Three inside, two little ones up top.

142
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:36,682
Get up behind. If a boy drops off the back,
that's £20 a year lost.

143
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:42,682
If he is the schoolmaster,
what kind of school can it be?

144
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:44,864
I hardly know.

145
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:48,818
Bless you both.

146
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,545
Goodbye.

147
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:59,545
Someday, we will once again
share the protection of the same roof...

148
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,727
and revive the happiness denied to us now.

149
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:05,591
I promise.

150
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,864
Young man.

151
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:18,409
Forgive me. I know the world.

152
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:20,409
Your father didn't...

153
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:23,409
or he wouldn't have done me a kindness
without hope of a return.

154
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:26,955
You don't, or you wouldn't be bound
on such a journey.

155
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,727
If ever you should need help
or shelter in London...

156
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:33,818
Oh, dear. I once thought I never should.

157
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:38,818
They know where I live,
at the Sign of the Crown in Golden Square.

158
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:40,682
You can come at night.

159
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,545
- Once, nobody was ashamed.
- Ashamed?

160
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:46,955
Where are you, Nickleby? Up.

161
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:50,864
If you should go near Barnard Castle,
there's good ale at the King's Head.

162
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,591
Say you know me,
and I'm sure they won't charge you for it.

163
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:55,818
And...

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,318
you may say "Mr. Noggs" there...

165
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:02,045
for I was a gentleman then.

166
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,318
I was.

167
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:15,136
- Walk on.
- Goodbye, Nicholas.

168
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,955
Whoa!

169
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:48,045
Smike!

170
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,045
Is this Dotheboys Hall?

171
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,545
No need to call it a hall up here.

172
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,955
We call it that in London,
because it sounds better.

173
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,409
Hurry, lad!

174
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:27,591
Where the devil were you?

175
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:29,182
Please, sir...

176
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,955
I fell asleep over the fire.

177
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,409
Missus said I might go in there for a warm.

178
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:38,409
You'd have been a deuced deal
more wakeful out in the cold.

179
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:44,409
Is that my Squeery?

180
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:53,409
The crime of my dead eye, my love...

181
00:14:53,455 --> 00:14:55,864
is that I can't see you twice.

182
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,545
- How's the pig?
- Just as you left her.

183
00:14:58,682 --> 00:14:59,591
And the boys?

184
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,000
Young Braithwaite's had a fever.

185
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:04,045
Third time this year.

186
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:07,864
I say it's obstinacy,
and we beat it out of him.

187
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:11,727
No one can cure an illness
quicker than you, my love.

188
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,318
This is the new man, Mr. Nickleby.

189
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:20,545
- I hope you're not hungry.
- I am.

190
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:22,045
Of course you are.

191
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:24,955
I've got a nice hot stew
for you here, Squeery.

192
00:15:25,455 --> 00:15:27,318
And there's bread on the table.

193
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:32,409
I brought the letters to the boys,
I'll read them in the morning.

194
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:35,182
- I'm doing the brimstone first.
- Of course you are.

195
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:39,818
Grand piece of meat in that, Squeery.
Put the heat back in you.

196
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,409
Aye, it will.

197
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:43,955
- How was your journey, my pet?
- Dreadful.

198
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,727
- Was it perishing?
- Torture.

199
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,864
What?

200
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:55,955
Have you...

201
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:59,000
Did anybody...

202
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:03,045
Has nothing been heard...

203
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:07,000
about me?

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,273
Not a word, and never will we.

205
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,182
But count your blessings.
You've been here all these years...

206
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,182
and not a penny paid after the first six.

207
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,682
No clue as to who you belong to,
and still I feed you.

208
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,455
That's cause for joy.

209
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,455
And here's more cause for joy.

210
00:16:30,273 --> 00:16:31,545
Little Wackford.

211
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:36,545
Father!

212
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:40,545
Look what your pa brought you.

213
00:18:17,318 --> 00:18:18,455
"Dear Kate...

214
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:21,682
"My first morning here began with the news
that the pump had frozen...

215
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,591
"but events soon distracted me. "

216
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,591
- Smike!
- Who are you after?

217
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:29,136
It's brimstone morning,
and I can't find the school spoon.

218
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,318
We purify the boys' blood
now and then, Nickleby.

219
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,955
Purify, fiddlesticks!

220
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,727
We give the boys brimstone and treacle,
Mr. Knuckleboy...

221
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:42,409
because if we didn't,
they'd always be ailing.

222
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:47,000
It spoils their appetites and comes cheaper
than breakfast and dinner.

223
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:50,591
You might say it does them good
and us good at the same time.

224
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:52,591
Smike!

225
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,136
- Where's the school spoon?
- Please, ma'am.

226
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:00,727
Please.

227
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,727
Don't contradict your mistress.

228
00:19:11,273 --> 00:19:12,409
Take it.

229
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,409
Take it. Be thankful.

230
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:19,136
A most invaluable woman that.
I don't know her equal.

231
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:20,455
Nor I.

232
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:22,318
- No, please!
- Take it.

233
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,136
And thank me for it.

234
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:25,727
She does things for them boys...

235
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:29,409
that I don't believe half the mothers going
would do for their own sons.

236
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,409
- I should think they would not, sir.
- No.

237
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:35,864
"Mr. Squeers' return from London
is a great event...

238
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,045
"as he brings the boys news from home. "

239
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,682
Bolder, come here.

240
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:45,818
No letters.

241
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,182
But I saw your father in London.

242
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,955
He was £2.10 short in his payments.

243
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:52,455
One...

244
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,045
two, three...

245
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,545
- Four...
- Five, six.

246
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:00,955
But the good news is, we'll keep you on.
Smike, take him out.

247
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:04,136
Letter for Cobbey. Stand up.

248
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,318
Your grandmother's dead.

249
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:11,818
Your uncle's took to drink.

250
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:15,182
That's all the news your sister sends,
except for eight pence...

251
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,045
which will just cover the square of glass
you broke last week.

252
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:20,545
"After this, classes began. "

253
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,136
Where's Graymarsh?

254
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:24,591
Please, sir, he's cleaning
the back parlor window.

255
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,955
Perfect. C-L-E-A-N, "clean."

256
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:30,045
Verb, active, "to make bright."

257
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:31,682
"Winder," a casement.

258
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:34,818
"Win": W-l-N, "der": D-E-R.

259
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:37,545
When the boy knows this,
he goes and does it.

260
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:38,682
Where's Dorn?

261
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:41,545
- Please, sir, he's weeding the garden.
- To be sure.

262
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:46,136
"Bot": B-O-T, "tin": T-l-N, "ney": N-E-Y.

263
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:48,818
"Bottiney." Noun, substantive.

264
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:52,045
Knowledge of plants,
which he's applying right now.

265
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:54,682
That's our system, Nickleby.
What do you think of it?

266
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:55,682
It's useful.

267
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:57,955
"And so went the day.

268
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:02,455
"I very much hope I can be of service here. "

269
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:14,318
Are you cold?

270
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,045
You're shivering, poor fellow.

271
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,409
There.

272
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:33,818
Oh, dear, my heart.

273
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:38,045
I feel lost here, too.

274
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:41,591
But we must always hope.

275
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:44,591
Hope?

276
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:49,545
Do you remember the boy who died here?

277
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:51,455
I was not here.

278
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:53,136
What of him?

279
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,318
I was with him that night.

280
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:03,318
He began to see faces around his bed
that came from home.

281
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:10,318
He said they smiled and talked to him.

282
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:16,000
At last, he died...

283
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,409
lifting his head to kiss them.

284
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:26,727
Yes?

285
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:32,864
What faces will smile on me when I die?

286
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,455
Who will comfort me that long night?

287
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,455
They cannot come from home.

288
00:22:42,818 --> 00:22:46,000
They would frighten me if they did,
for I shouldn't know them.

289
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:52,591
There is no hope.

290
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:56,727
- No hope for me at all!
- What's the matter, love?

291
00:22:56,864 --> 00:22:59,545
Tilda's getting married to John Browdie.

292
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:02,591
I'll be the only girl in the county
who hasn't posted my banns.

293
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,682
John Browdie's no catch. I hate him.

294
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:07,182
Eat your breakfast.

295
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,455
I'll never eat again.

296
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,864
How do you like Mr. Knuckleboy?

297
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:14,318
I hate him, that's how I like him.

298
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,591
He's a nasty, stuck-up monkey.

299
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:20,545
He needs his pride brought down.

300
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:24,045
I'll leave that to you, my love.
There's not a woman in all England...

301
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,000
can bring a person's pride down
quicker than you can.

302
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:30,455
Thank you, Squeery.

303
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:33,864
Who's Mr. Knuckleboy?

304
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,318
The new teacher.

305
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:39,591
A smile like a sugar-drop,
and the straightest legs I've ever seen.

306
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:44,864
The word for "window"...

307
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
- Is "fenêtre", F-E-N-E...
- Oh, father.

308
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,864
I beg your pardon.
I thought my father was here.

309
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:57,045
- I'm so foolish, I'm sure.
- Not at all.

310
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:02,000
Again, the word for "window" is "fenêtre."

311
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,409
I'm sure I am foolish.

312
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:10,045
It's just my pen is in need of...

313
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:16,000
mending.

314
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,045
May I be of service?

315
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:22,000
No, I just couldn't.

316
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:23,864
All right.

317
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:27,955
Tilda!

318
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:34,000
- What is it, Fanny?
- I am engaged!

319
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:38,864
To whom?

320
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:42,136
- To the new schoolteacher.
- The speed of it!

321
00:24:42,545 --> 00:24:43,682
What's he said?

322
00:24:44,045 --> 00:24:48,591
We don't need language.
If you could have only seen his looks.

323
00:24:48,682 --> 00:24:50,545
Did he look at you like this?

324
00:24:51,727 --> 00:24:55,273
If he did, you're engaged.
That's how John looked at me.

325
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,955
Hope it was better than that.
Thee'd have run to the hills.

326
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,182
Hush, John! So, when is the day?

327
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:04,545
We just need a final declaration to settle it...

328
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:07,182
but he's shy in the way of words.

329
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:09,727
Fanny, I'm so happy for you.

330
00:25:54,273 --> 00:25:56,455
Have you read The Pilgrim's Progress?

331
00:26:29,591 --> 00:26:31,955
"The Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan.

332
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:37,182
"As I walked through the wilderness
of this world, I lighted on a certain"...

333
00:26:37,273 --> 00:26:39,591
What do you think you're doing?

334
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:43,682
Get on with your work!

335
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:49,000
Don't give me that high-and-mighty look.

336
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:51,136
He don't pay.

337
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:54,136
Therefore, he works.

338
00:27:04,545 --> 00:27:05,591
Ladies.

339
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:13,545
Quick, I must do something
to engage his sympathy...

340
00:27:13,682 --> 00:27:16,182
and bring him to the declaration.
Should I choke?

341
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:19,136
I think fainting might be more romantic
than choking.

342
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:24,682
Mr. Nickleby, help!

343
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:32,318
- What's happened?
- I think she was undone by your coldness.

344
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:35,182
Was I abrupt?
My mind, I'm afraid, was on other matters.

345
00:27:35,182 --> 00:27:36,818
I'm sure it wasn't deliberate.

346
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,682
It's just that with all the feelings
so nearly expressed between you of late...

347
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:49,682
If I caused any distress,
I reproach myself most bitterly, but...

348
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,273
This is most awkward, but...

349
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:58,545
- Does your friend think I'm in love with her?
- Does she think so? Of course.

350
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:00,955
But I've made no such declaration.

351
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:03,682
Your eyes said what your mouth could not.

352
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:07,045
Perhaps my mouth should say
what my eyes have not.

353
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:10,045
I have scarcely seen the young lady
three times...

354
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:14,000
but should I have seen her 30 or 30,000,
it would be the same.

355
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:17,273
I have not one thought,
hope or wish connected with her...

356
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:20,273
unless it be part of the picture
I keep in my mind...

357
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:23,682
of one day being able to turn my back
upon this accursed place...

358
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:27,955
and never to think of it again
with any feeling but loathing and disgust.

359
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:32,591
Refused by a teacher...

360
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,864
picked up by an advertisement.

361
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:38,455
He's insulted not just you,
but the whole house of Squeers.

362
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,591
He's proud. I said so from the start.

363
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,136
He must be wounded.

364
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,318
I hate him like poison!

365
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:49,000
Where is Smike? We need wood.

366
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:52,864
He's with Mr. Nickleby.
He waits on him hand and foot.

367
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:02,136
He must not have enough to do.

368
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:06,955
We must think of how better
to occupy our Smike.

369
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:22,682
They are so hard on me.

370
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:25,545
But for you...

371
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,591
they would kill me.

372
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:35,045
I fear they may be killing you because of me.

373
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,455
You will do better when I am gone.

374
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:41,682
Gone?

375
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,955
Are you going?

376
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:48,000
I would go tomorrow if I could.

377
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:51,727
Tell me...

378
00:29:52,818 --> 00:29:54,682
is the world as bad as this place?

379
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,955
Oh, no.

380
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:59,682
Should I ever meet you there?

381
00:30:00,955 --> 00:30:02,955
- Why, yes, I'm sure at some...
- No.

382
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:04,864
Tell me.

383
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,682
Tell me that I should be sure to find you.

384
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:13,455
You would.

385
00:30:15,136 --> 00:30:17,318
And I would help you and aid you...

386
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,318
and not bring fresh sorrow on you,
as I have done here.

387
00:30:32,182 --> 00:30:33,682
He is not here, sir!

388
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:39,682
Show yourself!

389
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,455
Who knows where he is?

390
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,182
Please, sir, I think he's run away.

391
00:30:54,682 --> 00:30:57,818
And what possible reason
would any boy have...

392
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,273
to run away from my establishment?

393
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,182
Do you think he's run away?

394
00:31:03,273 --> 00:31:04,591
I hope so!

395
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:06,045
Squeery...

396
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:10,045
we best go find him.

397
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:20,864
But if you lift one finger...

398
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:24,045
to stop what's about to begin...

399
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:29,455
you and I will fall out in a way...

400
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:33,318
that will spoil your beauty.

401
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:43,727
Take pattern by Smike if you dare, boys!

402
00:31:45,818 --> 00:31:49,000
You'll see what he'll get for hisself
when he's brought back.

403
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:53,318
For brought back he will be.

404
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:57,955
You go the north way, Squeery,
I'll take the west.

405
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:05,273
Mr. Squeers!

406
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,273
Please!

407
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:10,591
I beg you, forgive the boy!
He is not in his right mind.

408
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:13,136
That will soon be the least of his problems.

409
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,318
Father, please don't let them find him.

410
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,136
If they do, let him be dead...

411
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,136
his last breath a free one.

412
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,318
Does he have him? Is it Smike?

413
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:53,318
Is she back with him?

414
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:55,864
Then you do not have him.

415
00:33:56,455 --> 00:33:57,545
Thank God.

416
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,545
Squeery!

417
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:22,727
We have him!

418
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:30,182
Is every boy here?

419
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,273
Get back!

420
00:34:34,318 --> 00:34:35,864
And you.

421
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:49,000
Have you anything to say?

422
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:53,682
Please, sir, spare me.

423
00:34:54,682 --> 00:34:56,545
I'll spare you.

424
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:04,136
I'll flog you to within an inch of your life,
and I'll spare you then.

425
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:14,591
Stop!

426
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,409
This must not go on.

427
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:23,045
I will not allow it.

428
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:27,545
You dare to challenge my authority!

429
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,000
Stay back!

430
00:35:30,682 --> 00:35:32,591
Touch him at your peril!

431
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,318
I will not stand by and see it done.

432
00:35:36,273 --> 00:35:38,000
You will do as you're told!

433
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:42,591
If you raise the devil within me, the
consequences shall fall on your own head!

434
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:44,545
Once I begin, God help you!

435
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:50,955
Stop!

436
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:57,727
No, please, wait!

437
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:05,409
I do not know why,
but I am going to show you...

438
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,000
what you have never shown any boy
in this room.

439
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:12,545
Pity.

440
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:52,000
Wait. I say, wait!

441
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,682
I've come from the schoolhouse.

442
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:04,318
Mr. Squeers says he was attacked.
Beaten, and nearly senseless.

443
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:08,182
When he said it was thee who did it,
I knew thee must not be allowed to leave...

444
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:09,682
We will not be stopped!

445
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:13,273
...without my shaking your hand,
and saying to thee, "Job well done."

446
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,409
Give us thee hand, will you?

447
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,545
Whoever heard the like of it?

448
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:19,591
I only wish...

449
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,318
I could've been there to see it myself.

450
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,727
What do thee mean to do now?

451
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,864
- I don't know.
- How much cash has thee got?

452
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:36,136
- Not much. But I'll find...
- Take what you need.

453
00:37:36,182 --> 00:37:37,864
- I could not.
- Please.

454
00:37:40,273 --> 00:37:42,955
Every boy in that room
would add to it if he could.

455
00:37:43,864 --> 00:37:45,318
Thank you.

456
00:37:46,273 --> 00:37:49,318
Here, and take this bit of timber, too,
to help thee on.

457
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:51,864
You keep a good heart.

458
00:37:52,864 --> 00:37:54,409
God bless thee!

459
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,818
Beating the schoolmaster!

460
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:03,682
God, it's the best thing
I've heard in 20 years.

461
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:17,545
Tomorrow...

462
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:20,182
where will you go?

463
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,545
Perhaps to Liverpool.

464
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:25,273
I could find work on a ship.

465
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:30,273
Do not be anxious.

466
00:38:31,182 --> 00:38:33,955
Before I do anything,
I will get you to your home.

467
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:35,591
Where is it?

468
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:42,455
You are my home.

469
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:44,864
Smike!

470
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,545
Please, may I go with you to the sea?

471
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,864
I will be your faithful,
hard-working servant. I will.

472
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:53,682
I promise I will.

473
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:56,273
I want only to be near you.

474
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:05,591
The word which separates us
shall never be said by me.

475
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,045
And I promise you, from this night forward...

476
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,545
the world shall deal by you as it does by me.

477
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:25,045
Do you have a family...

478
00:39:26,273 --> 00:39:27,955
or are you alone, as I am?

479
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:30,409
I have a mother and a sister.

480
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,045
Dear God!

481
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,591
If he has sent me here,
what has he done to Kate?

482
00:39:38,136 --> 00:39:39,455
I'm grateful that you came.

483
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:41,455
It is a boon to a single man...

484
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,545
to have such a lady as yourself
for my hostess.

485
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,273
I know little of how these things
are done in London.

486
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,455
Surely one of the other ladies
would be more adept.

487
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:53,000
You are the only lady present.

488
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:57,136
By the time I was finished,
she couldn't escape.

489
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:07,591
Have you thought about the investment
I brought you?

490
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,818
It has its merits and its risks.

491
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:14,818
You know, Nickleby, I've noticed
you never seem to touch your wine...

492
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:16,455
while we drink and drink.

493
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:18,455
I like to keep a clear head.

494
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:20,273
Yet you pour us so much.

495
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,182
I must say, it is a pleasure
having your niece with us.

496
00:40:23,182 --> 00:40:26,682
He must have designed that, too,
to soften you into speculating.

497
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:29,182
If I could see someone
as winning as Miss Nickleby...

498
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:31,045
when I talk business with her uncle...

499
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,727
I can think of no other place
I'd rather talk business.

500
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:36,455
No other place on Earth.

501
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:38,682
Hear, hear!

502
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:44,000
Gentlemen, I feel
we are boring Miss Nickleby.

503
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:46,727
Look, she can barely raise her eyes.

504
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:52,000
The poor dear girl simply cannot understand
why no one here is making love to her.

505
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:55,682
She gasps! I have uncovered her secret.

506
00:40:57,318 --> 00:40:59,000
You misunderstand me.

507
00:40:59,045 --> 00:41:01,273
In fact, I'll hold any man £50...

508
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:06,000
that Miss Nickleby can't look in my face
and tell me that she wasn't thinking so.

509
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,864
Done!

510
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:12,136
Pray, do not make me the subject of bets.

511
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:14,591
Uncle, please!

512
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:17,318
Why not, if the gentlemen insist?

513
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:19,182
It's a minute's work.

514
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:23,818
Just lift your eyes and tell me that
you're not hoping I would make love to you.

515
00:41:26,955 --> 00:41:29,273
Get your money ready, gentlemen.

516
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:33,818
She's not going to say it,
because she wants me to make love to her.

517
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,409
Can you, girl?

518
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:41,136
Can you say that you don't wish me
to make love to you?

519
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,727
Hush, my dear.

520
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:14,045
Don't mind it, now.

521
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:16,136
Then let me go.

522
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:18,955
Let me leave this place.

523
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,000
You must dry your eyes first.

524
00:42:23,727 --> 00:42:25,591
Let me raise your head.

525
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,045
There.

526
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:47,000
Uncle...

527
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:51,864
what have I done
that you should subject me to this?

528
00:42:57,318 --> 00:42:59,318
I didn't know it would be so.

529
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:14,864
Can you remember
when you first came to Mr. Squeers'?

530
00:43:15,182 --> 00:43:17,545
Surely you did not
find your way there alone?

531
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:19,136
I could not have.

532
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:22,318
I was brought by a small, withered man.

533
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:24,000
I was afraid of him.

534
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:27,182
But then they made me more afraid of them.

535
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,455
Tremendous. Positively tremendous.

536
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:45,591
That'll be a double encore
if you take care, boys!

537
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:49,045
Don't you concur?
Was that not the very picture of excitement?

538
00:43:49,682 --> 00:43:50,955
It was very good.

539
00:43:52,136 --> 00:43:54,136
- Although...
- Although?

540
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:58,455
They might be better matched
in terms of size.

541
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:01,591
How are you to get up the sympathies
of the audience...

542
00:44:01,727 --> 00:44:05,273
if there isn't a little man
contending against a bigger one?

543
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,455
I confess, I had not considered that.

544
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:10,682
We have had a long day's walk
without much...

545
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:11,864
Without much?

546
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:14,045
Food.

547
00:44:14,455 --> 00:44:15,591
Dear me.

548
00:44:15,682 --> 00:44:19,682
Let it never be said
that any man went hungry here or here...

549
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:21,591
when he was with Vincent Crummles.

550
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:23,682
Boys, set the table at once!

551
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,455
We shall adjourn to the dining room.

552
00:44:27,273 --> 00:44:29,864
My friend and I
shall try for a berth on a ship.

553
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:35,864
Does no other profession suggest itself
to a young man of your figure and bearing?

554
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:39,000
- I think the sea offers a great many...
- What about the stage?

555
00:44:39,045 --> 00:44:41,591
- The stage?
- The theatrical profession!

556
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:45,864
I am in the theatrical profession myself.
My wife is in the theatrical profession.

557
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:48,409
My children are in the theatrical profession.

558
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:51,045
I had a dog that lived and died in it...

559
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:55,000
and the pony that pulled us here today
is third generation.

560
00:44:55,545 --> 00:44:57,864
His mother could fire a pistol...

561
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and get in bed wearing a nightcap.

562
00:45:00,182 --> 00:45:01,136
But...

563
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:03,864
there is tragedy in the family.

564
00:45:05,045 --> 00:45:07,682
- In the pony's family?
- Yes.

565
00:45:08,591 --> 00:45:10,545
The father drank.

566
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:13,045
Ended up in the circus...

567
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:15,955
drinking port wine with the clowns.

568
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,682
Got greedy, couldn't quit...

569
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:22,591
and choked on the bottle.

570
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:28,545
At any rate, I'd love
to bring you and your friend out.

571
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:30,455
He has a capital countenance!

572
00:45:30,545 --> 00:45:32,045
Why, as he is now...

573
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:35,455
he would make such an apothecary
in Romeo and Juliet...

574
00:45:35,545 --> 00:45:38,273
that he would be certain
of three rounds of applause...

575
00:45:38,273 --> 00:45:41,136
the minute he put his face
out of the practicable door!

576
00:45:41,182 --> 00:45:43,000
- And you!
- Me?

577
00:45:43,455 --> 00:45:46,955
- You were born for the lamps!
- No, sir, I think...

578
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:50,273
You could be useful in a hundred ways.
You could write plays!

579
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,455
I dare say, I could scribble something,
now and then.

580
00:45:54,545 --> 00:45:58,455
Whatever you write, please include a pump
and two washing tubs.

581
00:45:58,545 --> 00:46:00,409
I just bought them at a sale.

582
00:46:00,818 --> 00:46:02,591
Could I live by such a trade?

583
00:46:03,273 --> 00:46:06,864
Like a prince!
With your own salary, and your friend's...

584
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:10,591
and your writing, you could make £1 a week!

585
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:13,545
With a good run of houses, double that.

586
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:17,136
Then I accept, and happily!

587
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:20,273
Arise, young man.

588
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:22,864
You've been transformed!

589
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:25,273
You went to sleep a wretch...

590
00:46:25,318 --> 00:46:27,182
you awake an actor!

591
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:38,318
- Mrs. C, could I have a word?
- What is it now, Mr. Folair?

592
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,864
About my roar.

593
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:44,136
There are two options available to you.
A rugged...

594
00:46:44,182 --> 00:46:45,318
My dear.

595
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:50,136
I've made another discovery.

596
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:54,818
Messieurs Nickleby and Smike,
may I present Mrs. Crummles.

597
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:58,318
Welcome to our family of players!

598
00:46:58,864 --> 00:47:02,182
We were just about to rehearse
the climax of our drama.

599
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:04,182
Will you watch with us...

600
00:47:04,818 --> 00:47:06,545
and feel with us?

601
00:47:08,727 --> 00:47:11,591
Ladies and gentlemen, places, please.

602
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:16,727
I must warn you,
Folair has been hopeless today!

603
00:47:23,864 --> 00:47:27,000
Play the terror, but don't lose the joy!

604
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:30,864
Your trap!

605
00:47:31,136 --> 00:47:33,409
Mr. Folair, shut your trap!

606
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:40,955
Somebody forgot his spear.

607
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:46,318
The flames! And remember, they're hot!

608
00:47:47,136 --> 00:47:49,409
Oh, dear, it's almost too real!

609
00:47:50,182 --> 00:47:53,136
Remember, Mr. Folair, you are a savage...

610
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:55,045
not a demented fairy!

611
00:47:55,182 --> 00:47:57,409
Don't lose your theatricality!

612
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Ninetta, dear, would you move
that flower to your other hand?

613
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,818
Mr. Folair, there's a problem with your head!

614
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:05,955
Perfect!

615
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:10,318
Bravo!

616
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:12,727
Thrilling in the extreme!

617
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:14,864
Gentlemen...

618
00:48:15,136 --> 00:48:17,000
this is Miss Ninetta Crummles...

619
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:18,864
the Infant Phenomenon.

620
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,727
How old is she?

621
00:48:24,545 --> 00:48:26,591
She is 10 years of age, sir.

622
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:28,955
Not more?

623
00:48:31,273 --> 00:48:32,273
Not a day.

624
00:48:32,864 --> 00:48:33,818
- My dear?
- Yes?

625
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:37,182
It is of the utmost that I speak to you
about a great struggle...

626
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:41,727
which is taking place outside
this mortal temple we call the theater.

627
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:44,864
The contestants are
those aged combatants...

628
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:46,136
art...

629
00:48:46,682 --> 00:48:48,409
and commerce.

630
00:48:48,955 --> 00:48:51,591
And art, it would appear from the receipts...

631
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:54,455
is in its usual position of jeopardy.

632
00:48:55,818 --> 00:48:58,182
Might you and I have a word, à deux?

633
00:48:58,273 --> 00:48:59,955
Excusez-moi.

634
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,955
"Infant Phenomenon!"
"Infant humbug" is more to the point!

635
00:49:09,455 --> 00:49:12,682
She has been 10 for the past 8 years!

636
00:49:13,545 --> 00:49:16,727
They keep her on a diet of gin and water
to hold back her growth.

637
00:49:16,727 --> 00:49:19,318
- You don't say!
- I do say, sir. I do!

638
00:49:19,682 --> 00:49:23,182
That hammy sprawler keeps the rest of us
from doing our specialties.

639
00:49:24,273 --> 00:49:26,545
Mine is the Highland Fling.

640
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:29,273
Would you like to see it?

641
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:31,000
Please.

642
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,318
Ladies and gentlemen...

643
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:41,727
based on the receipts
Mrs. Crummles has shown me...

644
00:49:41,864 --> 00:49:44,273
Liverpool has little relish...

645
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:49,000
for high-minded theatrical entertainments
properly conducted.

646
00:49:49,591 --> 00:49:51,409
We must give them our pity.

647
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,955
Now, we must give them something
they will pay to see.

648
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,955
Romeo and Juliet.

649
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:04,136
But we have no Romeo.
Mr. Leadville's leg is broke.

650
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:08,727
I don't mind! I can manage!

651
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:11,864
Old friend...

652
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,136
it may be time
for you to move on from Romeo.

653
00:50:15,864 --> 00:50:16,818
Move on?

654
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:18,591
To what?

655
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,045
Lear?

656
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:24,545
Mr. Nickleby will take that part.

657
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:28,545
And do you not think his friend
would make a smashing apothecary?

658
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:36,818
His face practically erupts with drama!

659
00:50:37,864 --> 00:50:39,409
What an acquisition!

660
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:42,545
These speeches! Listen to this.

661
00:50:43,045 --> 00:50:45,727
"Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand...

662
00:50:45,818 --> 00:50:48,000
"that I might touch that cheek."

663
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,455
Are you worried
about how to memorize so much?

664
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:53,000
I am, and I have barely a word to say!

665
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:54,591
It is not only that...

666
00:50:54,682 --> 00:50:58,000
but a desire to know someone
to whom I could say such things.

667
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:03,182
My father told me that the great journey
of my life would be to find such a person...

668
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,318
but I'm nearly 20 years of age,
and I fear he may be wrong.

669
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:11,955
- I hope not.
- I hope not, too.

670
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,182
May I ask you why you were so upset seeing
that savage come through the trapdoor?

671
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,818
You asked me yesterday if I had a memory
about my life before Yorkshire.

672
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:28,318
There is but one thing I remember.

673
00:51:29,682 --> 00:51:31,591
It was the room in which I was kept.

674
00:51:33,682 --> 00:51:36,318
It was a lonesome room
at the top of a house.

675
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:39,727
There was a large black hook
that hung down from the ceiling.

676
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:43,136
Underneath it was a trapdoor.

677
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:48,409
I was so afraid of what might be
on the other side...

678
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:52,136
that there was not a single night
I did not cover my head in the bedclothes.

679
00:51:53,136 --> 00:51:56,682
So today, when a door so very like it
opened in the dark before me...

680
00:51:58,864 --> 00:52:01,000
I could not watch what came out of it.

681
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:03,409
Carry on.

682
00:52:10,182 --> 00:52:12,409
We have fallen on strange times.

683
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:13,864
Yes...

684
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,182
but wondrous strange.

685
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:32,682
- What's come then?
- I have.

686
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
- What else?
- A letter, marked:

687
00:52:38,409 --> 00:52:42,318
"Urgent, as well as extremely important."

688
00:52:43,545 --> 00:52:45,136
It's from the Squeers.

689
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:46,818
Wackford?

690
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:49,182
Doubtful. It's perfumed.

691
00:52:51,818 --> 00:52:53,818
"Dear Mr. Knuckleboy, sir.

692
00:52:54,182 --> 00:52:56,727
"My pa requests me to write to you.

693
00:52:56,864 --> 00:52:59,045
"The doctor's considering it doubtful...

694
00:52:59,136 --> 00:53:01,955
"whether he will ever recover
the use of his legs...

695
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:04,136
"which prevents his holding a pen.

696
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,318
"He was brought to this state
by your nephew...

697
00:53:07,409 --> 00:53:09,864
"who jumped upon my pa's body
with his feet...

698
00:53:09,955 --> 00:53:11,591
"and dashed him to the earth."

699
00:53:11,727 --> 00:53:14,273
"Dashed him to the earth."
Very nice, my dear!

700
00:53:14,727 --> 00:53:16,818
"He also attacked him with language...

701
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:20,045
"which I will not pollute my pen
with describing.

702
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:22,273
"He assaulted my ma...

703
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:26,318
"by driving her back-comb several inches
into her head.

704
00:53:26,591 --> 00:53:31,000
"We have a medical certificate that says,
if the comb had entered her skull...

705
00:53:31,182 --> 00:53:34,045
"the tortoiseshell
might have affected her brain.

706
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:37,318
"The monster then ran away...

707
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:40,045
"taking with him a boy
of desperate character...

708
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:43,818
"as well as a garnet ring
belonging to my nearly dead ma.

709
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,545
"Would you please send us money
compensating for its loss...

710
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,591
"in the amount of 22..."

711
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:50,864
- 4.
- 8.

712
00:53:51,864 --> 00:53:53,682
"£28.10.

713
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,864
"Remain yours, etc., Fanny Squeers."

714
00:53:57,955 --> 00:53:59,545
The boy has crossed me.

715
00:54:00,591 --> 00:54:03,864
- I did not expect otherwise.
- He's written as well.

716
00:54:04,727 --> 00:54:06,273
Pride, obstinacy.

717
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:10,182
A reputation for fine feelings
are all against it.

718
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,591
He's gone to Liverpool.

719
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:15,864
Taken some employment.

720
00:54:17,136 --> 00:54:19,000
Otherwise it's all excuses.

721
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:22,545
I predict he soon will be on some ship.

722
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:24,818
Gone.

723
00:54:26,955 --> 00:54:27,864
Forever.

724
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:37,727
Child...

725
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:42,136
forgive me. I have been remiss
in my attentions to you and your mother.

726
00:54:42,864 --> 00:54:46,455
I came to enquire whether you and she
would accompany me to the theater...

727
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:48,000
on Friday evening?

728
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,318
That is most kind of you, Uncle.

729
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:52,000
Very well.

730
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:53,864
I shall call for you.

731
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:03,000
She has accepted.

732
00:55:15,864 --> 00:55:18,045
I have a genuine interest in Shakespeare...

733
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:22,136
especially after having been
to that dear little dull house he was born in.

734
00:55:22,591 --> 00:55:24,182
How fascinating. May I?

735
00:55:24,727 --> 00:55:26,545
Nickleby? Is that you?

736
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:29,273
Nickleby, are you all alone?

737
00:55:29,864 --> 00:55:32,000
What luck!

738
00:55:38,045 --> 00:55:39,545
The drama begins.

739
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:45,864
Her eyes in heaven...

740
00:55:45,864 --> 00:55:49,545
would through the airy region
stream so bright...

741
00:55:49,864 --> 00:55:53,182
that birds would sing,
and think it were not night.

742
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:57,182
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

743
00:55:57,545 --> 00:56:00,273
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand...

744
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:02,182
that I might touch that cheek!

745
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:04,545
Ay, me!

746
00:56:04,955 --> 00:56:06,955
I should like to be your glove...

747
00:56:07,136 --> 00:56:09,455
as much to touch your cheek...

748
00:56:09,545 --> 00:56:11,591
as to grip your fingers.

749
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:14,182
Bravo!

750
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:20,136
- Don't hurry.
- Please do not detain me.

751
00:56:20,182 --> 00:56:22,955
Now, why do you keep up
this show of displeasure?

752
00:56:23,136 --> 00:56:26,273
Show? Nothing could be more sincerely felt.

753
00:56:26,955 --> 00:56:29,409
Indeed, you're prettier
when you are in a passion.

754
00:56:29,455 --> 00:56:33,591
I wish my brother were here. He'd be in a
passion from which you'd not soon recover.

755
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:36,591
Linger with me just a moment
as they extinguish the lights.

756
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:37,591
I will not.

757
00:56:37,591 --> 00:56:41,045
- Will you deny me everything I want?
- Lf everything you want is wrong.

758
00:56:41,136 --> 00:56:43,955
Please, let me rejoin my family.
My mother will be anxious.

759
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:48,000
Your mother, child, is already anxious
that you should find a proper prospect.

760
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,955
I would hazard that she is delighted
we are by ourselves...

761
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,455
and I imagine the longer we are gone,
the less anxious she will be.

762
00:56:54,591 --> 00:56:57,682
Do not mock me.
You do not consider me a prospect...

763
00:56:57,818 --> 00:57:00,273
but a plaything, and I consider you neither.

764
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,318
To treat me this way in a public place
could ruin my reputation.

765
00:57:04,727 --> 00:57:07,727
And every chance for a decent
and loving marriage will be gone.

766
00:57:07,818 --> 00:57:12,545
If it's privacy you want, let me give it to you.
But I'll have what I want and wait no more.

767
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:21,727
I have a genuine interest in Shakespeare.

768
00:57:22,045 --> 00:57:23,455
Mother, may we go?

769
00:57:23,682 --> 00:57:25,318
It was delightful to see you.

770
00:57:25,455 --> 00:57:27,727
- Mother, please.
- Is something wrong?

771
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:34,955
Uncle...

772
00:57:36,045 --> 00:57:38,545
I have been wounded past all healing...

773
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:42,000
and by your friends.

774
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:44,409
What can you mean? I have no friends.

775
00:57:44,682 --> 00:57:48,545
If they are not your friends, then more
shame on you for bringing me among them.

776
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:51,455
I see you have
some of the boy's blood in you.

777
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:54,955
I hope I have.

778
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:57,273
I should be proud.

779
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:02,000
You know what happened under this roof.

780
00:58:03,545 --> 00:58:05,591
Last night was far worse.

781
00:58:07,182 --> 00:58:09,045
You have influence with these men.

782
00:58:09,136 --> 00:58:11,727
One word from you would induce
them to desist.

783
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:16,273
What of it if an old man whispers
inanities in your ear on Monday?

784
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,591
Some other novelty
will spring up on Tuesday.

785
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:21,182
In the meantime, you must be practical.

786
00:58:21,455 --> 00:58:24,000
The money that allows me
to help you and your mother...

787
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:26,955
in some portion comes from these men.

788
00:58:29,955 --> 00:58:30,864
Uncle...

789
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:36,045
I am grateful
for all that you have done for us...

790
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:39,955
but do not mistake me.

791
00:58:40,864 --> 00:58:42,273
I am not a toy.

792
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:45,864
I will live with dignity.

793
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,409
If that means...

794
00:58:48,455 --> 00:58:51,455
that I must set up my mother
and myself on our own...

795
00:58:51,864 --> 00:58:53,955
and hide myself from your friends...

796
00:58:54,818 --> 00:58:56,409
I will do so...

797
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:01,000
knowing God will help us,
even if you will not.

798
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,273
If the boy drowns, or is lost at sea...

799
00:59:14,045 --> 00:59:15,864
this house could be hers.

800
00:59:18,136 --> 00:59:19,955
How pretty she would make it.

801
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:25,864
Dear girl, here. Take this.

802
00:59:26,455 --> 00:59:27,955
But I am not crying.

803
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:30,955
The handkerchief's for me.
The arm's for you.

804
00:59:32,727 --> 00:59:35,864
To hear you speak so bravely
and not give way before him...

805
00:59:35,955 --> 00:59:39,955
My admiration moves me to this.
Your brother, he'd be so proud.

806
00:59:43,136 --> 00:59:45,864
That's right, yes. Give way now.

807
00:59:47,273 --> 00:59:48,409
Noggs!

808
00:59:52,045 --> 00:59:56,318
You're not alone. I'll see you soon.
And so shall someone else.

809
00:59:57,864 --> 00:59:59,182
God bless you.

810
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:18,000
Again. "What ho! Apothecary!"

811
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:20,955
It's no use. I can't remember it.

812
01:00:21,045 --> 01:00:23,318
Smike, you can only fail by not trying.

813
01:00:24,682 --> 01:00:26,000
"Who calls so loud?"

814
01:00:26,045 --> 01:00:29,727
It is a crime that Mr. C has not found a spot
for my Highland Fling.

815
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,682
Romeo and Juliet
will not be the same without it.

816
01:00:32,818 --> 01:00:34,455
"Who calls so loud?"

817
01:00:34,455 --> 01:00:38,000
- May I tempt you with a humble offering?
- Please.

818
01:00:38,045 --> 01:00:41,955
The lamps are lit! Your public awaits!

819
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:45,727
Let us use our bodies like instruments...

820
01:00:45,864 --> 01:00:49,955
and quiver together until music comes out!

821
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:56,409
You will be wonderful. Just relax.

822
01:00:58,136 --> 01:00:59,182
Relax.

823
01:01:04,682 --> 01:01:06,136
"Who calls so loud?"

824
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:11,045
If a man did need a poison...

825
01:01:11,182 --> 01:01:14,000
here lives a caitiff wretch
who would sell it to him.

826
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,727
What ho! Apothecary!

827
01:01:26,409 --> 01:01:27,682
What ho?

828
01:02:05,545 --> 01:02:07,136
Who calls so loud?

829
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:10,682
Well done.

830
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:17,955
Mr. Nickleby?

831
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,955
- This just came.
- Thank you.

832
01:02:23,591 --> 01:02:26,000
If it is an offer from a competing company...

833
01:02:26,045 --> 01:02:29,000
I hope you honor it
with the respect it deserves...

834
01:02:29,273 --> 01:02:30,273
none.

835
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,545
Newman says Kate is in some sort of peril.

836
01:02:33,864 --> 01:02:35,955
He says we must come to London at once.

837
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,864
You leave us?
At the very moment of your triumph?

838
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,955
- I must, sir. It is a family drama.
- Those are always popular.

839
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,591
We shall miss you, Nicholas.

840
01:02:50,955 --> 01:02:53,545
Very well, we'll have posters
out in the morning...

841
01:02:53,591 --> 01:02:56,682
announcing positively
your last performance for tomorrow.

842
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,591
Then re-engagement
by popular demand for Friday.

843
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:04,318
And then, one absolutely
last-time-ever appearance...

844
01:03:04,455 --> 01:03:06,409
on any stage, Saturday...

845
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:11,318
with the possibility
of a second show to follow.

846
01:03:12,182 --> 01:03:15,545
No man has been more helpful
to me in my time of trouble than you...

847
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,864
but I must say that tonight
was my absolutely, positively...

848
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:20,864
final last performance.

849
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,727
There is an urgent family crisis.
I must be no less quick in responding to it...

850
01:03:24,818 --> 01:03:28,318
than you would be if the Infant Phenomenon
herself were in danger.

851
01:03:35,318 --> 01:03:37,455
There is only one response to that.

852
01:03:39,864 --> 01:03:42,818
Farewell, my noble, lion-hearted boy.

853
01:03:43,182 --> 01:03:45,955
- We shall never forget you.
- Nor we you.

854
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:49,182
And have you anything to say, my boy?

855
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:51,591
Who calls so loud?

856
01:03:57,818 --> 01:04:00,591
- Goodbye. Thank you.
- Farewell, dear friends.

857
01:04:00,864 --> 01:04:02,682
Ladies and gentlemen...

858
01:04:02,727 --> 01:04:06,045
if you found these goodbyes affecting...

859
01:04:06,136 --> 01:04:10,455
you will love our production
of Romeo and Juliet...

860
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:14,591
miraculously recast
with that great Italian actor...

861
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:16,682
whose name shall be revealed...

862
01:04:16,955 --> 01:04:20,409
only to ticket buyers
at tonight's performance...

863
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:23,455
but who promises,
in honor of the local tastes...

864
01:04:23,591 --> 01:04:26,818
to deftly insert into tonight's story...

865
01:04:27,682 --> 01:04:29,864
the Highland Fling.

866
01:04:40,818 --> 01:04:42,273
Mr. Noggs is in here?

867
01:04:42,682 --> 01:04:44,818
He said for us to wait for him here.

868
01:04:45,455 --> 01:04:47,318
Shall I get you something to eat?

869
01:04:47,455 --> 01:04:50,818
- It may be some time before Newman arrives.
- Yes, please.

870
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,455
Not as much as little Kate Nickleby!

871
01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:58,727
Tell us again what she said
in Nickleby's box.

872
01:04:58,818 --> 01:05:01,136
She said she wished
her brother were there...

873
01:05:01,136 --> 01:05:04,273
as he would be in a passion
that I would not soon forget!

874
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:09,727
Didn't she also say something about,
"If you press yourself further...

875
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,955
"I shall lose every hope
of a loving and decent marriage"?

876
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,591
I thought that was a bit much.

877
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,318
A word with you, sir.

878
01:05:20,273 --> 01:05:21,955
Will you step apart with me?

879
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:26,682
I see no reason to step in any direction
until you state your name and business, sir.

880
01:05:27,318 --> 01:05:31,136
My name is Nicholas Nickleby.
Miss Nickleby's brother.

881
01:05:31,591 --> 01:05:34,682
I denounce you as a liar
and impeach you as a coward.

882
01:05:34,955 --> 01:05:37,591
- You will tell me your name.
- Certainly not.

883
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,045
If there is a gentleman in this party...

884
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:44,409
he will acquaint me with the name
and residence of this man.

885
01:05:46,273 --> 01:05:48,136
Someone answer me!

886
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:51,273
My sister's good name is at stake!

887
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:53,591
This dog is bothering me.

888
01:05:53,682 --> 01:05:55,864
I am the son of a country gentleman...

889
01:05:56,045 --> 01:05:57,864
your equal in education and birth...

890
01:05:57,955 --> 01:06:00,864
and your superior, I trust,
in everything besides.

891
01:06:01,045 --> 01:06:05,591
It is as much in his name as it is in my own,
that I demand you answer for your conduct.

892
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:07,818
Here is my answer, sir.

893
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:11,818
Now, gentlemen.

894
01:06:12,545 --> 01:06:13,455
No!

895
01:06:19,682 --> 01:06:22,000
Come near my sister again...

896
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:24,318
and I shall not be so forgiving.

897
01:06:29,182 --> 01:06:31,864
The Exchange is now open for business.

898
01:06:56,727 --> 01:06:58,727
You are known to me now...

899
01:06:59,136 --> 01:07:01,409
every suspicion viciously confirmed.

900
01:07:01,682 --> 01:07:03,409
And you to me.

901
01:07:04,591 --> 01:07:07,136
I? What wrong have I done?

902
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:09,045
Did you not attack the schoolmaster?

903
01:07:09,182 --> 01:07:11,455
The monster was beating a crippled boy!

904
01:07:12,045 --> 01:07:14,136
You choose to restore that boy?

905
01:07:14,182 --> 01:07:16,727
No more than I would restore
a lamb to a wolf.

906
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:20,182
Then your appearance here
to beg my help is in vain.

907
01:07:21,864 --> 01:07:24,545
You mistake the point of this conference.

908
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:27,864
We knew no shame until we knew you...

909
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:30,455
and the degradations we have endured...

910
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:34,682
whether at Dotheboys Hall
or in the dark box of a theatre...

911
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:37,818
all trace their poisoned roots to you.

912
01:07:39,545 --> 01:07:41,591
You did not want us when we came...

913
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:45,000
and it shamed me to seek help
from someone unwilling to give it.

914
01:07:46,182 --> 01:07:49,727
Now our only shame is the blood
which binds our name to yours.

915
01:07:49,864 --> 01:07:53,682
Therefore, your brother's widow
and her children renounce you!

916
01:07:55,682 --> 01:07:59,955
May every recollection of your life cast
a terrifying darkness over your deathbed.

917
01:08:01,182 --> 01:08:03,545
How soon that day may come,
I cannot know.

918
01:08:03,591 --> 01:08:07,182
But I do know that in our life,
you live no more.

919
01:08:08,136 --> 01:08:09,045
I disown him.

920
01:08:09,864 --> 01:08:12,409
I would give good money
to have him stabbed...

921
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:15,182
and rolled into the kennels
for the dogs to devour.

922
01:08:15,273 --> 01:08:16,409
As would I.

923
01:08:16,455 --> 01:08:19,955
But I am sure he's left London
in fear of my retribution.

924
01:08:20,136 --> 01:08:22,727
Oh, indeed, sir, he has not.

925
01:08:23,455 --> 01:08:26,000
I saw him just now in the city...

926
01:08:26,045 --> 01:08:28,545
boasting of his triumphal attack over you.

927
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:30,000
I don't believe it.

928
01:08:30,136 --> 01:08:33,591
You were there last night, Lord Verisopht.
I wager you could believe it.

929
01:08:33,727 --> 01:08:35,591
I'll tell you what I believe.

930
01:08:36,818 --> 01:08:39,136
I believe you have
only yourself to blame, Hawk.

931
01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:40,273
What?

932
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:43,682
If you had only told him who you were,
as he asked.

933
01:08:44,682 --> 01:08:46,545
I was wrong, too, not to interfere.

934
01:08:46,545 --> 01:08:48,545
I did not sleep the night, thinking about it.

935
01:08:48,682 --> 01:08:51,727
Whatever mistakes were made,
were made by the boy.

936
01:08:52,682 --> 01:08:55,864
I am his uncle,
and even I can see that he is no good.

937
01:08:56,182 --> 01:08:58,818
He was defending the honor of his sister.

938
01:08:58,864 --> 01:09:01,818
That is the very definition of goodness.

939
01:09:04,045 --> 01:09:07,409
How can you not be proud of what
he's done in defense of your own niece?

940
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,455
You will be glad, my Lord, that I possess...

941
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:12,727
such an unsentimental view
when I am managing your investments.

942
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,409
Mr. Nickleby, I am no longer sure
I can make an investment with you.

943
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:24,682
- Because of my nephew?
- Because of your treatment of him!

944
01:09:25,273 --> 01:09:27,045
And his sister!

945
01:09:28,318 --> 01:09:31,136
When I think of her leaving
the theater that night...

946
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,182
I feel sick to recall it.

947
01:09:35,955 --> 01:09:39,000
Surely there is another way for me
to expand my fortune...

948
01:09:39,136 --> 01:09:41,545
than to enrich the tormentor...

949
01:09:42,682 --> 01:09:44,455
of these children.

950
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:11,136
I see, from your eyes, you remember me.

951
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:15,545
If the change you see in me,
from so long ago, does not move you...

952
01:10:15,682 --> 01:10:16,591
It does not.

953
01:10:16,682 --> 01:10:20,682
...then let the knowledge that I am
as helpless and destitute as a child.

954
01:10:20,682 --> 01:10:23,182
- Any man can earn his bread.
- How?

955
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:25,955
Would you show me the means?

956
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,864
I did, once.

957
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,136
Not again.

958
01:10:30,318 --> 01:10:33,409
It's 20 years and 5 months
since you and I fell out.

959
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:35,864
Do you remember the cause?

960
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:38,682
You claimed part of the profits
of some of my business...

961
01:10:38,682 --> 01:10:41,682
alleging that you had brought it to me.
When I refused you...

962
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:44,545
you threatened to reveal some...
What was it you said?

963
01:10:44,682 --> 01:10:46,682
Hold I'd gained over you in your absence.

964
01:10:46,727 --> 01:10:49,000
Rifling through my files, I suspect.

965
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,727
So I had you arrested
for an advance you had not repaid.

966
01:10:51,818 --> 01:10:54,591
£30. That's all I owed you.

967
01:10:54,864 --> 01:10:56,273
Indeed, it was more.

968
01:10:56,955 --> 01:10:58,545
There was the interest.

969
01:10:59,545 --> 01:11:03,045
Seven years I have been gone,
under the most crushing conditions...

970
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:06,545
to return as you see me now,
ready to renew my offer...

971
01:11:06,545 --> 01:11:09,455
but on terms much easier for you
than before.

972
01:11:10,409 --> 01:11:13,591
You will want this information.
I want only to eat and drink.

973
01:11:15,182 --> 01:11:16,409
Is that all?

974
01:11:17,455 --> 01:11:19,955
It depends on you whether that's all or not.

975
01:11:21,682 --> 01:11:24,682
Are you threatening now to tell others...

976
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,591
of whatever you learned
when you were my clerk?

977
01:11:28,182 --> 01:11:30,318
To be plain with you, Mr. Brooker...

978
01:11:31,182 --> 01:11:33,818
the world already knows
what sort of man I am...

979
01:11:35,727 --> 01:11:37,545
and I do not grow poorer.

980
01:11:38,455 --> 01:11:41,818
- You cannot stain a black coat.
- That's not what I meant.

981
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:44,409
Are those of your own name dear to you?
If they are...

982
01:11:44,455 --> 01:11:45,545
They are not.

983
01:11:45,545 --> 01:11:46,727
- But...
- But nothing.

984
01:11:46,864 --> 01:11:48,045
If we meet again...

985
01:11:48,136 --> 01:11:51,000
and you so much as notice me
with one begging gesture...

986
01:11:51,045 --> 01:11:53,591
you shall see the inside of a jail once more.

987
01:11:55,955 --> 01:11:58,455
That is my answer to your trash.

988
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,318
Mother...

989
01:12:03,818 --> 01:12:04,955
this is Smike.

990
01:12:05,273 --> 01:12:09,273
- How do you do, Mr. Pike?
- No, Mother, "Smike," with an "S."

991
01:12:10,273 --> 01:12:13,136
- How do you do?
- Very well, thank you, Mr. Spike.

992
01:12:15,455 --> 01:12:17,591
And this is our landlady, Miss Lacreevy.

993
01:12:17,682 --> 01:12:19,955
She is the artist
whose work fills these walls.

994
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:23,273
I do hope you will let me make
a miniature of you.

995
01:12:26,318 --> 01:12:29,591
Kate, this is my faithful friend
and fellow traveler.

996
01:12:30,591 --> 01:12:32,045
I have been so eager...

997
01:12:32,136 --> 01:12:34,864
to thank you
for being such a comfort to Nicholas.

998
01:12:40,955 --> 01:12:42,682
He is my only friend.

999
01:12:43,455 --> 01:12:45,545
I would lay down my life to help him.

1000
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:48,955
To a new beginning.

1001
01:12:49,182 --> 01:12:51,818
- To new subjects.
- To an end of villains.

1002
01:12:51,864 --> 01:12:54,136
To finding proper work as soon as I can.

1003
01:12:54,182 --> 01:12:57,682
- And to our extended family.
- Hear, hear.

1004
01:12:58,682 --> 01:13:00,045
Our family.

1005
01:13:22,818 --> 01:13:26,136
- Pork pie, mister?
- No, thank you.

1006
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:44,455
Are you well?

1007
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:45,591
Yes, I...

1008
01:13:47,455 --> 01:13:48,864
Only weary.

1009
01:13:49,182 --> 01:13:51,864
You look so pale and were still so long.

1010
01:13:53,182 --> 01:13:54,591
Forgive me.

1011
01:14:27,591 --> 01:14:29,591
There are many opportunities here.

1012
01:14:29,727 --> 01:14:33,045
Surely a fine-looking gentleman
is not reduced to such a necessity?

1013
01:14:33,045 --> 01:14:34,818
I look no finer than you, sir.

1014
01:14:34,864 --> 01:14:37,682
Yes, but I seek a worker, not work.

1015
01:14:40,545 --> 01:14:42,273
How did this come about?

1016
01:14:43,273 --> 01:14:44,818
Who's it for?

1017
01:14:45,818 --> 01:14:47,000
My father.

1018
01:14:48,136 --> 01:14:51,318
It's a bad thing for a young man
to lose a father.

1019
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:54,955
I feel more of a child
than when he was alive.

1020
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:59,136
And so I am obliged
to throw off my uncle's protection...

1021
01:14:59,182 --> 01:15:01,818
and take care of mother,
Kate, and Smike myself.

1022
01:15:02,455 --> 01:15:05,591
- But I grow desperate.
- Now, don't say another word.

1023
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:13,818
My boy.

1024
01:15:16,818 --> 01:15:19,545
My good sir,
would you be so good as to wait here?

1025
01:15:22,545 --> 01:15:24,591
- Brother Ned?
- Yes, brother Charles?

1026
01:15:25,045 --> 01:15:29,045
I've found someone for the position. We
should make inquiries into his statements.

1027
01:15:29,182 --> 01:15:32,136
If confirmed, I'm hopeful they will be,
we should assist him.

1028
01:15:32,136 --> 01:15:36,455
It's enough for me that if you say he should
be assisted, then we shall assist him.

1029
01:15:36,955 --> 01:15:39,409
He has a mother, sister,
and friend in need of support...

1030
01:15:39,545 --> 01:15:41,591
as well as the demands of his own stomach.

1031
01:15:41,727 --> 01:15:45,000
Compared to us, dear brother,
he appears to have no stomach at all.

1032
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:46,591
Frank, where are those cakes?

1033
01:15:46,682 --> 01:15:49,455
- Mr. Nickleby, my brother, Ned.
- How do you do, sir?

1034
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:52,136
Thank you, Frank.

1035
01:15:54,955 --> 01:15:57,409
- My friend.
- Thank you.

1036
01:15:57,455 --> 01:16:00,273
Would you give us a moment
to discuss your salary?

1037
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:01,727
Now then...

1038
01:16:01,818 --> 01:16:03,727
I suppose we should ascertain
his previous...

1039
01:16:03,818 --> 01:16:05,545
His previous stipend, of course.

1040
01:16:05,591 --> 01:16:08,545
Forgive me, sir, your previous salary was?

1041
01:16:12,545 --> 01:16:14,000
£1 a week, sir.

1042
01:16:14,682 --> 01:16:17,682
An annual salary of £52.

1043
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:20,182
That's rather an unsuitable
emolument for a boy.

1044
01:16:20,273 --> 01:16:22,591
For such a talented, prospective youth.

1045
01:16:27,864 --> 01:16:30,591
Mr. Nickleby, we would like to offer you
a position here...

1046
01:16:30,682 --> 01:16:32,591
working alongside our nephew, Frank.

1047
01:16:32,682 --> 01:16:34,818
Based on the feeling I had during our walk...

1048
01:16:34,818 --> 01:16:38,591
as well as by the rapidity
with which you ate that cake...

1049
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:42,727
we'd like to begin you on a salary
of £120 a year.

1050
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:49,136
Is it not enough?

1051
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:51,818
- We won't wait long before improving it.
- No.

1052
01:16:52,682 --> 01:16:55,318
It is the generosity of it that undoes me.

1053
01:16:56,818 --> 01:16:58,545
For the first time since Father died...

1054
01:16:58,545 --> 01:17:01,591
I feel we may at last be in a position
to find happiness.

1055
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:04,864
Thank you, both, a thousand times.

1056
01:17:10,182 --> 01:17:12,136
- Are you at home?
- Yes.

1057
01:17:12,273 --> 01:17:13,591
- To anybody?
- Yes.

1058
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:15,955
- To the tax gatherer?
- No.

1059
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,545
What about...

1060
01:17:20,455 --> 01:17:22,318
I'd know your face anywhere.

1061
01:17:22,409 --> 01:17:25,545
You'd know it better
if your nephew hadn't maltreated it.

1062
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:27,545
Who is this?

1063
01:17:27,955 --> 01:17:29,864
My son, little Wackford.

1064
01:17:30,591 --> 01:17:33,455
Indeed a specimen
of the Dotheboys's old diet.

1065
01:17:33,727 --> 01:17:35,591
A miracle of high feeding.

1066
01:17:36,273 --> 01:17:38,455
His flesh, his firmness.

1067
01:17:40,182 --> 01:17:41,182
No tears.

1068
01:17:41,864 --> 01:17:43,273
His oiliness.

1069
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:45,045
I'd expect nothing less.

1070
01:17:46,455 --> 01:17:49,682
And Mrs. Squeers, how is...

1071
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:54,318
Mrs. Squeers is as she always is.
A joy to all them as knows her.

1072
01:17:54,818 --> 01:17:57,727
One of our lads had an abscess last week.

1073
01:17:58,818 --> 01:18:01,727
To see her operate on him with a penknife.

1074
01:18:02,455 --> 01:18:05,318
And you? Have you recovered
from that scoundrel's attack?

1075
01:18:05,409 --> 01:18:06,409
Only just.

1076
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,136
Your nephew is a vicious animal.

1077
01:18:09,545 --> 01:18:11,545
That is why I asked you to come.

1078
01:18:12,136 --> 01:18:13,045
Noggs...

1079
01:18:13,136 --> 01:18:15,455
- See this package?
- It's big enough.

1080
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:17,545
Take it, please, at once.

1081
01:18:18,455 --> 01:18:20,727
"Take it, please, at once."

1082
01:18:21,136 --> 01:18:24,455
"At once, do you hear? If not sooner."

1083
01:18:26,455 --> 01:18:28,000
He may be a little mad.

1084
01:18:29,727 --> 01:18:31,955
I wanted to offer you...

1085
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:35,273
this as a recompense...

1086
01:18:35,955 --> 01:18:38,000
to your troubles, though...

1087
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:40,318
it seems foolish...

1088
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,727
if the boy is unpunished.

1089
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,591
He might come after you again.

1090
01:18:44,727 --> 01:18:46,727
Surely he's been punished by you.

1091
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:48,000
Our ties have been cut.

1092
01:18:48,136 --> 01:18:51,000
I'm not sure
that he views that as a punishment.

1093
01:18:52,318 --> 01:18:54,000
What about the other boy?

1094
01:18:54,136 --> 01:18:55,455
- Smike?
- Yes.

1095
01:18:57,136 --> 01:19:00,409
You said that my nephew
was quite attached to him.

1096
01:19:01,045 --> 01:19:02,682
What do you know of him?

1097
01:19:02,955 --> 01:19:05,864
Only that he came to us 12 or so years ago.

1098
01:19:05,955 --> 01:19:09,045
The money was paid at first,
and then it stopped.

1099
01:19:10,182 --> 01:19:12,182
But I kept the lad out of charity...

1100
01:19:12,318 --> 01:19:15,545
which coincided with a period
of usefulness on his part.

1101
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:17,682
- No parents then?
- No.

1102
01:19:17,682 --> 01:19:20,045
- No person with any claim on him?
- No.

1103
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:22,682
So he's yours.

1104
01:19:23,045 --> 01:19:24,409
And he's been stolen.

1105
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:26,864
Would it not be well within your rights
to take him?

1106
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,545
That would settle your score
with my nephew.

1107
01:19:30,455 --> 01:19:33,182
Wounding him, not through force...

1108
01:19:35,136 --> 01:19:37,000
but through his own affections.

1109
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:42,045
Capturing wayward boys
is something of a specialty.

1110
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,409
It's most kind of you
to join me on my errands.

1111
01:19:46,455 --> 01:19:47,727
Ribbons for sale.

1112
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:50,182
- Oh, dear.
- What is it?

1113
01:19:50,545 --> 01:19:51,682
Father used to tell me...

1114
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:54,682
there were girls who sold ribbons
on the streets in London...

1115
01:19:54,818 --> 01:19:58,318
and that if we ever came here,
he would buy me some as a remembrance.

1116
01:20:00,318 --> 01:20:02,182
Ribbons for sale.

1117
01:20:08,955 --> 01:20:10,045
How much, please?

1118
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:12,182
Twopence for the pink ones.
Penny for the others.

1119
01:20:12,273 --> 01:20:14,000
I'll take the pink one, please.

1120
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:16,545
Thank you.

1121
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:26,591
Help!

1122
01:20:28,273 --> 01:20:29,591
Somebody! Help!

1123
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,409
It's Smike. He's been taken.

1124
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:44,182
It must be the wretched Squeers.
He was with your uncle.

1125
01:20:44,318 --> 01:20:46,955
I didn't hear it all,
but they were speaking of Smike.

1126
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,409
- Newman, what shall we do?
- He stays at the Saracen's Head.

1127
01:20:52,318 --> 01:20:54,955
Squeers, but no Smike.

1128
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,318
It's John Browdie.

1129
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:02,727
Is John Browdie good or bad?

1130
01:21:02,818 --> 01:21:05,182
He gave me money
when he heard I'd beaten Squeers.

1131
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:07,682
He's very good.

1132
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:12,318
If it isn't...

1133
01:21:14,045 --> 01:21:16,955
- What are you doing here?
- Tilda and I are on our honeymoon.

1134
01:21:17,045 --> 01:21:20,318
Schoolmaster says this was a fine place
to stay. He's here as well.

1135
01:21:20,318 --> 01:21:23,000
I know. You remember the boy
that was with me that night?

1136
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:24,955
Crippled lad? Of course.

1137
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,409
We suspect that Squeers has taken him,
just this day, by force.

1138
01:21:28,545 --> 01:21:31,409
He's talked of nothing but revenge
since you left.

1139
01:21:31,591 --> 01:21:33,000
Could you find out if he has him?

1140
01:21:33,273 --> 01:21:36,182
Who do you suppose we've laid
our hands on, Wackford and me?

1141
01:21:36,273 --> 01:21:39,273
In London?
Not that hateful, horrible Mr. Knuckleboy?

1142
01:21:39,273 --> 01:21:40,955
No, but next door to him.

1143
01:21:41,045 --> 01:21:43,455
- Smike?
- Aye!

1144
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:45,727
Me and young Wackford, we grabbed him!

1145
01:21:46,136 --> 01:21:49,136
He was crying and begging me to let him go,
but I wouldn't.

1146
01:21:49,182 --> 01:21:51,045
What have thee done with him?

1147
01:21:51,545 --> 01:21:54,182
He's in the schoolmaster's room,
next to our room.

1148
01:21:54,318 --> 01:21:56,545
- What is the way in?
- You must go through the inn...

1149
01:21:56,682 --> 01:21:59,955
but the schoolmaster is sitting
in the front room, just by the stairs.

1150
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:01,727
Oh, dear, it's impossible.

1151
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I could distract the schoolmaster.
Thee could slip past and go up to my room.

1152
01:22:06,045 --> 01:22:08,545
There is a door
adjoining the schoolmaster's.

1153
01:22:08,545 --> 01:22:10,136
Go through it, get the lad.

1154
01:22:10,182 --> 01:22:13,864
I'll watch the stairs and again try
to distract him when thee come out.

1155
01:22:13,955 --> 01:22:16,727
May I offer an opinion
with regards to this scheme?

1156
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,591
It seems foolhardy, redolent of danger...

1157
01:22:20,818 --> 01:22:24,455
and doomed to failure.
Otherwise, I can find no fault with it.

1158
01:22:25,455 --> 01:22:26,818
It is for Smike.

1159
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:34,409
Schoolmaster, I couldn't trouble thee
to take the head of the table, could I?

1160
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,727
I'd like to propose a toast to thee...

1161
01:22:38,136 --> 01:22:42,727
and thy family.
To thee, Mr. Squeers and the lovely Fanny.

1162
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:44,409
Mr. Squeers...

1163
01:22:44,682 --> 01:22:46,591
I'd like to congratulate thee.

1164
01:23:24,818 --> 01:23:27,455
I think it's about time for a song.
Come on, Tilda.

1165
01:24:01,727 --> 01:24:03,727
Be still. Do not worry.

1166
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:09,409
Thank you.

1167
01:24:10,455 --> 01:24:12,318
You are the best and bravest friend.

1168
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:15,682
Hush. Lean forward. I shall untie you.

1169
01:24:16,409 --> 01:24:18,318
Grand singer, my wife.

1170
01:24:18,591 --> 01:24:21,273
Little Wackford,
you left our bedroom window open.

1171
01:24:21,318 --> 01:24:24,818
- I did not.
- Don't argue with me, piglet, go and shut it.

1172
01:24:31,682 --> 01:24:33,818
I thought I would have to go back.

1173
01:24:35,818 --> 01:24:36,818
Never.

1174
01:24:37,455 --> 01:24:41,273
But we are not free yet.
Speed and silence are of the essence.

1175
01:25:04,318 --> 01:25:07,273
- Thee talking about the same blacksmith?
- Aye, that's him.

1176
01:25:07,409 --> 01:25:09,864
Saw him the other day. I stuck up for thee.

1177
01:25:10,682 --> 01:25:13,682
He said thee weren't fit to live with pigs.
I said thee were.

1178
01:25:13,727 --> 01:25:16,727
Thank you kindly, John Browdie,
you're an honorable man.

1179
01:25:29,409 --> 01:25:30,955
Fine door, that.

1180
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,273
Quick. Squeers is outside.

1181
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:51,136
- It's been a grand day, John Browdie.
- That it has.

1182
01:26:01,864 --> 01:26:03,545
He was stolen?

1183
01:26:04,045 --> 01:26:05,682
Right from under you?

1184
01:26:06,045 --> 01:26:08,955
To be literal about it,
and I'm not sure this will dissipate...

1185
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:11,136
your very strong emotions on the subject...

1186
01:26:11,182 --> 01:26:14,000
but he was actually stolen
right from over me.

1187
01:26:14,682 --> 01:26:17,955
My nephew does not know the enemy
he has made in me.

1188
01:26:18,409 --> 01:26:21,045
I shall put his ruin
ahead of my own business!

1189
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:24,545
- Certainly done that already.
- What?

1190
01:26:24,818 --> 01:26:28,682
The bank sent a letter
saying you were short in your accounts.

1191
01:26:28,955 --> 01:26:30,727
Sir Mulberry also wrote.

1192
01:26:31,455 --> 01:26:34,545
- He declined your invitation to invest.
- Rubbish!

1193
01:26:35,818 --> 01:26:37,727
The boy is not invincible.

1194
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:41,455
People who wish to be thought of as good
are always weak!

1195
01:26:44,136 --> 01:26:47,136
I will listen to every rumor
and every rumble...

1196
01:26:48,545 --> 01:26:50,273
until I can strike him.

1197
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,136
And then I will strike him...

1198
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:58,273
until he can be struck no more.

1199
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:10,409
Now, my dear, you must...

1200
01:27:10,455 --> 01:27:13,818
I do entreat and beseech of you...
You must get up.

1201
01:27:16,955 --> 01:27:19,273
Please, a chair, place her here.

1202
01:27:20,136 --> 01:27:22,682
Not a word for your life, brother Ned.

1203
01:27:22,818 --> 01:27:25,136
Now, my dear sir, you must leave.

1204
01:27:25,818 --> 01:27:28,318
Is there no way I could be of service?

1205
01:27:28,864 --> 01:27:30,727
...to which they said no.

1206
01:27:30,864 --> 01:27:34,045
It has now been three weeks.
She's never come back.

1207
01:27:34,136 --> 01:27:36,455
And no one will tell me anything about her.

1208
01:27:36,545 --> 01:27:40,727
They never answer any questions on it,
and discourage the posing of others.

1209
01:27:41,273 --> 01:27:42,955
This distresses me.

1210
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,182
Nicholas, have you found
your matching half?

1211
01:27:48,136 --> 01:27:50,955
Then we must think of how to find her.

1212
01:27:51,409 --> 01:27:54,273
For when she knows you,
she will love you, too.

1213
01:27:55,318 --> 01:27:59,136
This is our nephew, Frank.
This is Mr. Nickleby's sister, Kate.

1214
01:27:59,591 --> 01:28:02,455
My uncle says you're quite a gardener.
May I show you around?

1215
01:28:02,591 --> 01:28:03,591
Please.

1216
01:28:04,591 --> 01:28:06,864
Mrs. Nickleby, would you excuse Nicholas?

1217
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:09,318
We have a small matter of business
to attend to.

1218
01:28:09,318 --> 01:28:10,818
Of course.

1219
01:28:13,318 --> 01:28:16,182
I never thought I'd find fault
with your brother's statements...

1220
01:28:16,273 --> 01:28:18,682
but he has described you
as exceedingly pretty.

1221
01:28:18,818 --> 01:28:22,545
May I offer the correction
that such a remark seems inadequate?

1222
01:28:22,727 --> 01:28:24,318
He has told me much of you...

1223
01:28:24,409 --> 01:28:27,182
and of how patient
you have been in teaching him.

1224
01:28:30,682 --> 01:28:33,318
Do you remember the young lady
who fainted in our office?

1225
01:28:33,455 --> 01:28:34,682
Fainted?

1226
01:28:35,409 --> 01:28:36,409
Yes.

1227
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,955
She is the daughter of a lady whom,
when she herself was young...

1228
01:28:42,136 --> 01:28:43,864
I loved very dearly.

1229
01:28:51,455 --> 01:28:54,864
You will smile, perhaps,
to hear an old man talk about such things.

1230
01:28:55,182 --> 01:28:56,409
I have no such inclination.

1231
01:28:56,455 --> 01:28:59,591
In fact, I'm eager to know
if she returned your affection.

1232
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,182
She made another choice.

1233
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:03,273
A man named Bray.

1234
01:29:03,955 --> 01:29:08,045
Inconsiderate of all obligations,
except to those of his own leisure...

1235
01:29:08,318 --> 01:29:11,318
he squandered his fortune, and then hers.

1236
01:29:12,318 --> 01:29:16,273
Finally, after 20 years of bitter unhappiness,
she came to me...

1237
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,136
sadly changed. She was dying.

1238
01:29:20,682 --> 01:29:23,818
And she asked us
to help her daughter, Madeline...

1239
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:26,182
should she ever seek our assistance.

1240
01:29:26,955 --> 01:29:29,273
But Madeline has sought
these past two years...

1241
01:29:29,273 --> 01:29:31,182
to earn her money on her own.

1242
01:29:31,273 --> 01:29:34,864
However, the demands for service
her father places upon her...

1243
01:29:35,455 --> 01:29:39,727
make steady, not to mention lucrative,
employment an impossibility.

1244
01:29:40,045 --> 01:29:42,682
She came to us,
that day you caught her from fainting...

1245
01:29:42,818 --> 01:29:45,864
and made the appeal,
asking only that her father never know.

1246
01:29:46,727 --> 01:29:48,682
So we came up with this scheme...

1247
01:29:49,045 --> 01:29:51,727
of which we are not unreasonably proud.

1248
01:29:52,409 --> 01:29:55,455
- It is a very good scheme.
- It's very good, indeed.

1249
01:29:56,273 --> 01:29:58,591
Madeline is an artist...

1250
01:29:59,045 --> 01:30:01,727
and we thought
that someone could make a feint...

1251
01:30:01,818 --> 01:30:04,591
of commissioning her paintings
for a high price.

1252
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,682
This allows her to stay at home,
where he needs her...

1253
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:11,136
And allows our involvement to be disguised.
He knows us.

1254
01:30:11,591 --> 01:30:14,545
We were hoping you would be the agent.

1255
01:30:35,318 --> 01:30:37,136
Madeline, who is this?

1256
01:30:37,727 --> 01:30:40,000
Who told a stranger we could be seen?

1257
01:30:40,591 --> 01:30:43,273
I'm here to purchase some paintings, sir.

1258
01:30:43,818 --> 01:30:46,045
- These three, please.
- Very well.

1259
01:30:46,182 --> 01:30:49,591
I want a newspaper, and grapes,
and another bottle of wine!

1260
01:30:49,682 --> 01:30:53,455
Yes, Father, very well,
I'll just finish with this gentleman.

1261
01:30:53,545 --> 01:30:54,818
I want it now!

1262
01:31:01,455 --> 01:31:02,864
Please, Father.

1263
01:31:03,864 --> 01:31:07,273
This purchase will help us
pay for the things you want.

1264
01:31:08,318 --> 01:31:11,455
This never happened
when your mother was alive.

1265
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:19,864
Sir.

1266
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:24,955
Pray, do not mention to my mother's
dear friends what has passed here.

1267
01:31:25,045 --> 01:31:29,409
Father has suffered so much,
and is worse than usual this morning.

1268
01:31:30,045 --> 01:31:34,409
You have but to hint at a wish,
and I would hazard my life to gratify it.

1269
01:31:38,136 --> 01:31:42,045
Have you ever had the sensation
of looking at someone for the first time...

1270
01:31:42,045 --> 01:31:45,136
and ever so quickly,
the past and future seem to fuse?

1271
01:31:45,182 --> 01:31:47,864
- The first time I saw you...
- At your uncle's.

1272
01:31:47,955 --> 01:31:51,182
And then, that day on the street by the wall.

1273
01:31:51,545 --> 01:31:54,818
- You remember.
- I felt such concern for you.

1274
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,409
And I for you.

1275
01:31:56,727 --> 01:31:58,318
Does that not mean something?

1276
01:31:58,455 --> 01:32:01,545
That we felt so much, so deeply,
before speaking?

1277
01:32:02,409 --> 01:32:04,273
And now that I know your history...

1278
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:07,545
I entreat you to believe,
I would do anything to help you.

1279
01:32:12,273 --> 01:32:13,955
Do you know Madeline Bray?

1280
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,591
Nigel Bray's daughter?

1281
01:32:15,591 --> 01:32:19,000
Indeed I do. She may be
the prettiest girl in all of London.

1282
01:32:19,136 --> 01:32:21,045
Bray owes me money.

1283
01:32:21,682 --> 01:32:24,136
What if I were to erase that debt...

1284
01:32:24,273 --> 01:32:27,409
in exchange for his giving you
his daughter's hand?

1285
01:32:28,273 --> 01:32:32,000
Would that put you in a better frame of mind
to consider my investment?

1286
01:32:33,409 --> 01:32:35,682
I should say it would secure it.

1287
01:32:40,818 --> 01:32:41,818
My...

1288
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:46,409
the canvas must blush, she flatters it so.

1289
01:32:47,182 --> 01:32:49,182
Are they not extraordinary?

1290
01:32:51,273 --> 01:32:54,409
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I was passing this way.

1291
01:32:54,545 --> 01:32:58,318
I remember your telling me on our walk
how much you like violets.

1292
01:32:58,955 --> 01:33:01,864
I thought I would bring some
for your mother...

1293
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:03,727
and all of you.

1294
01:33:04,273 --> 01:33:07,455
That is most kind of you. They're lovely.

1295
01:33:09,318 --> 01:33:12,045
Thank you.
Won't you stay and have supper?

1296
01:33:13,409 --> 01:33:14,818
Why, of course.

1297
01:33:30,591 --> 01:33:33,273
Smike, old friend, will you not join us?

1298
01:33:34,455 --> 01:33:36,318
I'm not hungry tonight.

1299
01:33:47,591 --> 01:33:49,727
You seem so melancholy of late.

1300
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:52,727
Do you fear Squeers might come again?

1301
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,455
It is not that.

1302
01:33:59,318 --> 01:34:00,591
Then what?

1303
01:34:01,318 --> 01:34:04,000
Speak of it, and let me help you if I can.

1304
01:34:11,318 --> 01:34:13,727
I will tell you the reason one day...

1305
01:34:15,182 --> 01:34:16,318
not now.

1306
01:34:20,318 --> 01:34:22,045
I hate myself for it.

1307
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,727
But I cannot help it.

1308
01:34:31,409 --> 01:34:33,591
Will you trust me to tell you later?

1309
01:34:34,455 --> 01:34:35,727
Of course.

1310
01:34:46,818 --> 01:34:48,591
My heart is very full.

1311
01:34:51,273 --> 01:34:53,182
You cannot know how much.

1312
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,318
I shall want two more in a week's time.

1313
01:35:25,682 --> 01:35:27,273
Is that possible?

1314
01:35:27,545 --> 01:35:30,818
- There won't be any more sales.
- Father.

1315
01:35:32,136 --> 01:35:34,136
Not since the news.

1316
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,182
News?

1317
01:35:37,864 --> 01:35:39,045
What is it?

1318
01:35:45,545 --> 01:35:48,136
- Can you not go see her and ask?
- No.

1319
01:35:48,455 --> 01:35:51,545
That would arouse suspicion
on her father's part.

1320
01:35:51,864 --> 01:35:54,818
She will come to us and tell us, I feel sure.

1321
01:35:55,045 --> 01:35:57,000
I shall ask my sister and mother.

1322
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,591
Their feminine sympathies
may shed some light.

1323
01:35:59,591 --> 01:36:02,136
There is no need. Your sister is here.

1324
01:36:02,682 --> 01:36:04,136
Forgive me...

1325
01:36:04,182 --> 01:36:08,318
but there is a matter about which
I am harboring the gravest concerns.

1326
01:36:08,591 --> 01:36:09,955
It is Smike.

1327
01:36:11,864 --> 01:36:13,045
Inhale.

1328
01:36:16,273 --> 01:36:17,318
Again.

1329
01:36:17,409 --> 01:36:18,591
He's gravely ill.

1330
01:36:18,591 --> 01:36:21,409
Every token of rapid consumption
is present.

1331
01:36:21,682 --> 01:36:25,591
His only hope depends upon
his being instantly removed from London.

1332
01:36:26,455 --> 01:36:29,818
- Devonshire's the best place.
- We come from Devonshire.

1333
01:36:31,182 --> 01:36:35,182
Whoever takes him should
prepare for the worst. He may never return.

1334
01:36:37,273 --> 01:36:38,591
Good evening.

1335
01:36:45,818 --> 01:36:46,864
Father...

1336
01:36:46,955 --> 01:36:51,045
I know I am stronger than when you left us,
but not strong enough to lose Smike.

1337
01:36:51,818 --> 01:36:55,409
If this is what that strength is for,
then I do not want it.

1338
01:36:55,864 --> 01:36:57,182
Not Smike.

1339
01:37:16,818 --> 01:37:18,318
This is my room.

1340
01:38:16,682 --> 01:38:19,727
Once, when Kate was very little,
she was lost.

1341
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:23,545
After hours of search,
we found her here, fast asleep...

1342
01:38:23,591 --> 01:38:25,455
before there was any grave...

1343
01:38:25,455 --> 01:38:28,000
protected from the sun by this tree.

1344
01:38:28,682 --> 01:38:33,273
Father took her up, still sleeping,
and told my mother that whenever he died...

1345
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:37,182
he was to be buried
where his dear little child had laid her head.

1346
01:38:40,591 --> 01:38:42,455
It is a beautiful tree.

1347
01:38:44,955 --> 01:38:46,545
It is like a home.

1348
01:38:58,409 --> 01:39:00,000
What is it?

1349
01:39:01,864 --> 01:39:04,864
Do you remember my telling you
of the man who took me to school?

1350
01:39:04,864 --> 01:39:07,273
I just now raised my eyes
towards that tree...

1351
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,727
and there, with his eyes fixed on me,
he stood!

1352
01:39:09,727 --> 01:39:11,682
Only reflect for a moment.

1353
01:39:12,545 --> 01:39:13,955
Granted that he is alive...

1354
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,455
and wandering around
so lonely a place as this...

1355
01:39:16,545 --> 01:39:18,682
so far from the public road...

1356
01:39:19,136 --> 01:39:23,136
do you think at this distance of time
you could possibly know the man again?

1357
01:39:23,864 --> 01:39:25,045
Anywhere.

1358
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:29,591
Let us go inside.

1359
01:39:44,045 --> 01:39:46,136
I've had such pleasant dreams.

1360
01:39:52,045 --> 01:39:55,182
You asked me some time ago
why I was so melancholy.

1361
01:39:57,182 --> 01:39:58,864
Shall I tell you why?

1362
01:39:59,273 --> 01:40:01,000
Not if it pains you.

1363
01:40:01,318 --> 01:40:04,136
I only asked that I might make you happier.

1364
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,045
I know.

1365
01:40:08,727 --> 01:40:10,045
I felt that.

1366
01:40:13,955 --> 01:40:16,591
You will forgive me, because...

1367
01:40:17,727 --> 01:40:19,455
I could not help it.

1368
01:40:27,182 --> 01:40:31,045
Though I would've died to make her happy...

1369
01:40:33,045 --> 01:40:35,545
it broke my heart to see.

1370
01:40:39,591 --> 01:40:41,545
I know he loves her dearly.

1371
01:40:42,682 --> 01:40:43,591
Kate.

1372
01:40:50,955 --> 01:40:52,409
I love her.

1373
01:41:00,727 --> 01:41:02,864
I procured a lock of her hair.

1374
01:41:04,045 --> 01:41:06,727
It hangs at my breast, in these ribbons.

1375
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,455
When I am dead...

1376
01:41:14,455 --> 01:41:19,045
would you please take it off,
so that no eyes but yours might see it?

1377
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:24,682
And when I am laid in my coffin...

1378
01:41:25,818 --> 01:41:28,318
and am about to be put in the earth...

1379
01:41:30,045 --> 01:41:34,318
would you hang it round my neck,
that it might rest with me forever?

1380
01:41:35,955 --> 01:41:38,045
On my knees, I pledge it.

1381
01:41:44,545 --> 01:41:45,727
Now...

1382
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:49,182
Now I can say it:

1383
01:41:52,409 --> 01:41:53,727
I am happy.

1384
01:42:45,273 --> 01:42:46,182
Newman.

1385
01:42:52,818 --> 01:42:54,864
Smike is gone.

1386
01:42:57,591 --> 01:42:59,273
Bless you, dear boy.

1387
01:43:02,818 --> 01:43:04,727
Thank God for you, Newman.

1388
01:43:05,318 --> 01:43:07,273
Always there to catch me.

1389
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:10,409
But what brings you here?

1390
01:43:10,409 --> 01:43:13,682
The young lady
for whom you've come to care so deeply...

1391
01:43:13,727 --> 01:43:16,000
- Is she in danger?
- She's to be married...

1392
01:43:16,136 --> 01:43:18,136
- To Sir Mulberry Hawk.
- What?

1393
01:43:18,455 --> 01:43:21,273
Before I tell you this,
promise you won't do anything rash.

1394
01:43:21,318 --> 01:43:22,818
Tell me.

1395
01:43:23,818 --> 01:43:25,591
It was your uncle. It was his idea.

1396
01:43:25,727 --> 01:43:28,682
I overheard it,
and I'm sure he did it to wound you.

1397
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,818
I've so much more to tell you about him
and your dear friend Smike.

1398
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:37,182
Your uncle doesn't know it yet,
but he has just lost £10,000.

1399
01:43:46,545 --> 01:43:47,727
What are you doing here?

1400
01:43:47,818 --> 01:43:51,273
I come to offer aid
to the unhappy subject of your treachery:

1401
01:43:51,318 --> 01:43:54,273
- Madeline Bray.
- Do you know her?

1402
01:43:56,545 --> 01:43:58,409
I beg you for a moment alone.

1403
01:43:58,818 --> 01:44:00,682
You were betrayed and sold for money.

1404
01:44:00,682 --> 01:44:04,955
This web is of my own weaving.
I know what I am doing and why.

1405
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,045
I know why, too.
It only deepens my esteem for you.

1406
01:44:08,182 --> 01:44:10,455
But you cannot degrade yourself
in your esteem...

1407
01:44:10,455 --> 01:44:13,682
by giving yourself away
as payment for another man's debt.

1408
01:44:14,045 --> 01:44:18,409
I will not disguise from you, sir,
that I have undergone some...

1409
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,955
pain of mind.

1410
01:44:23,864 --> 01:44:26,864
I do not love the gentleman.

1411
01:44:28,045 --> 01:44:31,591
This he knows,
and knowing, still offers me his hand.

1412
01:44:31,591 --> 01:44:33,727
By accepting, I can free my father...

1413
01:44:33,818 --> 01:44:36,455
Does your own happiness matter so little?

1414
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:39,318
Father is all that remains of my family.

1415
01:44:39,318 --> 01:44:42,409
That is why I have come to offer you
a place in our home.

1416
01:44:47,545 --> 01:44:49,591
You have been so good to me.

1417
01:44:51,409 --> 01:44:53,682
But I cannot leave Father.

1418
01:44:53,955 --> 01:44:55,864
He must come with you.

1419
01:44:59,318 --> 01:45:00,818
He is too proud.

1420
01:45:02,818 --> 01:45:04,273
I am proud, too...

1421
01:45:07,273 --> 01:45:08,955
to know someone...

1422
01:45:10,182 --> 01:45:11,455
so good.

1423
01:45:16,318 --> 01:45:19,455
Madeline, come at once. It's your father.

1424
01:45:21,727 --> 01:45:24,455
He wouldn't stir, even after I tapped him.

1425
01:45:46,045 --> 01:45:47,045
Come.

1426
01:45:48,273 --> 01:45:50,045
Let us leave this place.

1427
01:45:56,273 --> 01:45:57,818
My curse upon you.

1428
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:01,455
My bitter, deadly curse upon you, boy.

1429
01:46:01,682 --> 01:46:03,818
Your curse has no power over me.

1430
01:46:04,682 --> 01:46:07,455
The structures you raised
all through your misspent life...

1431
01:46:07,545 --> 01:46:09,455
are crumbling into dust.

1432
01:46:10,318 --> 01:46:12,000
This very day...

1433
01:46:12,136 --> 01:46:16,136
£10,000 of your hoarded wealth are gone...

1434
01:46:16,955 --> 01:46:18,727
in one great crash.

1435
01:46:19,136 --> 01:46:23,182
- How could you know such a thing?
- It is true, and you shall find it so.

1436
01:46:24,273 --> 01:46:25,864
Your day is done.

1437
01:46:26,682 --> 01:46:28,727
Night is coming fast for you.

1438
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:37,045
£10,000? Can that be true?

1439
01:46:39,136 --> 01:46:41,182
I've invested such a sum...

1440
01:46:41,682 --> 01:46:44,273
and I am waiting...

1441
01:46:45,955 --> 01:46:47,455
for news of it.

1442
01:46:50,136 --> 01:46:52,136
But he could not know that.

1443
01:46:57,455 --> 01:47:00,955
If he is right that you have lost the money...

1444
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,045
and the money that Bray owed you,
you shall not have my money now.

1445
01:47:06,182 --> 01:47:07,136
He is...

1446
01:47:10,455 --> 01:47:11,545
not right.

1447
01:47:14,955 --> 01:47:18,727
My life collapsed like a house of sticks
the day my father died.

1448
01:47:19,318 --> 01:47:23,273
I clung to my mother and sister,
then Smike and Noggs...

1449
01:47:23,864 --> 01:47:26,591
hoping, waiting for I knew not what.

1450
01:47:27,273 --> 01:47:30,545
I knew not what,
until that day when I opened my eyes...

1451
01:47:30,591 --> 01:47:33,682
and the darkness
was replaced with the sight of your face.

1452
01:47:33,727 --> 01:47:38,000
It was the island towards which
I'd been sailing, unguided, my whole life...

1453
01:47:38,045 --> 01:47:42,136
the dream my father had promised me
before I could even imagine its existence.

1454
01:47:44,455 --> 01:47:48,318
I have been happy for times,
little times, since he died...

1455
01:47:49,273 --> 01:47:50,955
but never at peace.

1456
01:47:52,455 --> 01:47:54,727
Not until I looked at your face...

1457
01:47:54,864 --> 01:47:57,409
and saw the universe in order behind it.

1458
01:47:57,545 --> 01:47:58,818
Nicholas...

1459
01:48:00,727 --> 01:48:04,727
I feel you know what it's like
to be without happiness...

1460
01:48:06,182 --> 01:48:09,045
but do you know what it's like
to be afraid of it?

1461
01:48:09,182 --> 01:48:10,955
To see the world...

1462
01:48:11,409 --> 01:48:16,136
as so conniving, you cannot take pleasure
in the appearance of something good...

1463
01:48:17,409 --> 01:48:19,455
because you suspect...

1464
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:24,136
it is only a painted drop
behind which other troubles lie.

1465
01:48:25,682 --> 01:48:27,455
That has been my life.

1466
01:48:28,955 --> 01:48:31,318
Every good thing has been a trick.

1467
01:48:33,545 --> 01:48:34,864
Until you.

1468
01:48:36,818 --> 01:48:39,136
Yet I am afraid to take your hand.

1469
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:43,409
What if you cannot or will not...

1470
01:48:43,864 --> 01:48:45,000
save me?

1471
01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:49,182
I can bear to be maltreated
by the greedy or the weak...

1472
01:48:50,682 --> 01:48:52,409
but to be let down...

1473
01:48:53,545 --> 01:48:55,955
- By an angel...
- I am not an angel.

1474
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:59,818
I live as far from that lofty perch as any man.

1475
01:49:00,045 --> 01:49:02,409
My temper alone, my impatience...

1476
01:49:03,455 --> 01:49:07,318
Perhaps I should not list all my faults,
in case I am too persuasive.

1477
01:49:07,318 --> 01:49:11,000
You are the one
who is so admirably able and strong.

1478
01:49:19,545 --> 01:49:21,727
I am tired of being strong.

1479
01:49:23,591 --> 01:49:24,727
As am I.

1480
01:49:25,455 --> 01:49:28,864
Weakness is tiring,
but strength is exhausting.

1481
01:49:32,182 --> 01:49:34,273
You see, I cannot save you...

1482
01:49:35,545 --> 01:49:37,318
for I need saving, too.

1483
01:49:39,818 --> 01:49:41,545
What are you proposing?

1484
01:49:42,455 --> 01:49:43,727
Only this:

1485
01:49:44,545 --> 01:49:48,000
that we save ourselves together.

1486
01:50:01,409 --> 01:50:04,864
Nicholas, please. Think of the others.
People might see.

1487
01:50:06,727 --> 01:50:08,045
I don't care.

1488
01:50:23,318 --> 01:50:24,455
Noggs?

1489
01:51:06,136 --> 01:51:07,273
My God.

1490
01:51:29,455 --> 01:51:31,318
Ten thousand...

1491
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,136
pounds.

1492
01:52:11,182 --> 01:52:13,273
Who bade you enter this house?

1493
01:52:14,045 --> 01:52:18,136
- I have no business with you.
- Alas, we have business with you.

1494
01:52:19,727 --> 01:52:22,955
We have come
to report a tragedy in your family.

1495
01:52:23,545 --> 01:52:25,818
- Has something happened to my niece?
- No, sir.

1496
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:28,182
Though we do bring news of a death.

1497
01:52:28,318 --> 01:52:30,864
Don't tell me it's her brother's death?

1498
01:52:31,818 --> 01:52:33,955
That would be too welcome to be true.

1499
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,273
Sorry to disappoint you, Uncle.

1500
01:52:36,455 --> 01:52:39,455
But it will not be the last unhappy
development for you this night.

1501
01:52:39,591 --> 01:52:40,955
You know nothing.

1502
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,455
Every word I will say to you
is based on information...

1503
01:52:43,545 --> 01:52:45,591
from an unimpeachable source.

1504
01:52:46,136 --> 01:52:47,318
This man...

1505
01:52:48,273 --> 01:52:50,682
who'd sell his soul for a drink?

1506
01:52:51,136 --> 01:52:52,727
This is a good beginning.

1507
01:52:52,727 --> 01:52:55,591
To tamper with a fellow like this,
whose every word is a lie!

1508
01:52:55,682 --> 01:52:57,545
Who made me a fellow like this?

1509
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,182
If I'd sell my soul for a drink,
why wasn't I a thief?

1510
01:53:01,318 --> 01:53:02,545
Swindler?

1511
01:53:03,455 --> 01:53:05,818
Here, you, Nickleby!

1512
01:53:08,182 --> 01:53:10,591
You say they tampered with me.

1513
01:53:11,682 --> 01:53:14,955
Who was it tampered
with the Yorkshire schoolmaster...

1514
01:53:15,545 --> 01:53:17,727
to take Smike away from them?

1515
01:53:21,045 --> 01:53:23,727
You're listening now, aren't you?

1516
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,727
You are an eavesdropping,
drunken scoundrel.

1517
01:53:29,273 --> 01:53:32,545
I deny the charge,
but ask regardless, what of it?

1518
01:53:33,727 --> 01:53:36,000
I'm back, Mr. Nickleby.

1519
01:53:39,545 --> 01:53:41,045
What have we now?

1520
01:53:43,136 --> 01:53:44,455
Do you know who this is?

1521
01:53:44,545 --> 01:53:47,000
We are satisfied
Mr. Brooker speaks the truth.

1522
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,455
A common thief.

1523
01:53:49,955 --> 01:53:52,136
A beggar. A convict!

1524
01:53:53,318 --> 01:53:55,273
Were you not once married?

1525
01:53:59,045 --> 01:54:00,000
What?

1526
01:54:12,409 --> 01:54:14,318
There's no crime in that.

1527
01:54:14,864 --> 01:54:17,455
But you desired the marriage
to be kept secret...

1528
01:54:17,545 --> 01:54:19,455
for if your wife's father had known...

1529
01:54:19,591 --> 01:54:23,409
he would have changed his will
and denied you his fortune.

1530
01:54:28,045 --> 01:54:31,045
Mr. Brooker also tells us
your wife had a child.

1531
01:54:32,273 --> 01:54:33,545
Your child.

1532
01:54:35,318 --> 01:54:38,955
Because the marriage was secret,
this, too, had to be kept secret...

1533
01:54:39,136 --> 01:54:40,409
and you sent her away.

1534
01:54:40,409 --> 01:54:42,455
Hush, my dear.

1535
01:54:43,045 --> 01:54:44,727
Don't mind it now.

1536
01:54:45,318 --> 01:54:47,136
Let me raise your head.

1537
01:54:50,455 --> 01:54:51,591
There.

1538
01:54:54,545 --> 01:54:57,409
So the child was put out to nurse, far away.

1539
01:54:59,182 --> 01:55:03,045
His mother never saw him,
and she grew tired of the deception.

1540
01:55:04,182 --> 01:55:06,455
So she eloped with another man.

1541
01:55:06,727 --> 01:55:10,000
Soon thereafter, she came into her money.

1542
01:55:11,182 --> 01:55:13,409
You, naturally, pursued her...

1543
01:55:14,136 --> 01:55:15,864
leaving me in charge of the boy.

1544
01:55:16,818 --> 01:55:20,409
I was told to bring him here, which I did,
keeping him in the garret.

1545
01:55:20,818 --> 01:55:22,727
Neglect made him sickly.

1546
01:55:23,955 --> 01:55:25,591
Mr. Brooker consulted a doctor...

1547
01:55:25,727 --> 01:55:29,318
who said he must be removed from the city
for a change of air...

1548
01:55:29,727 --> 01:55:31,182
or he would die.

1549
01:55:33,682 --> 01:55:36,409
But he did die. I know that.

1550
01:55:37,182 --> 01:55:38,864
At last I can say it.

1551
01:55:39,455 --> 01:55:43,455
I told you that the boy had died,
but he had not.

1552
01:55:45,591 --> 01:55:48,864
I had heard, like most men,
of Yorkshire schools.

1553
01:55:49,455 --> 01:55:52,318
So I took the child to one
kept by a man named Squeers.

1554
01:55:54,318 --> 01:55:57,409
I was able to pay the fees myself,
but then my troubles took over...

1555
01:55:57,455 --> 01:55:59,864
and I was sent away out of this country.

1556
01:56:00,136 --> 01:56:03,591
When I returned, nearly eight years later,
I sought you out.

1557
01:56:04,136 --> 01:56:05,727
But you repulsed me.

1558
01:56:06,273 --> 01:56:08,182
So I found out your clerk...

1559
01:56:08,273 --> 01:56:11,682
and showed him there were good reasons
for communicating with me.

1560
01:56:12,045 --> 01:56:13,318
I told him my story.

1561
01:56:13,318 --> 01:56:16,727
But just to be sure that the boy
I was thinking of was the same boy...

1562
01:56:18,136 --> 01:56:21,727
I went to Devonshire,
and knew at once that it was.

1563
01:56:24,682 --> 01:56:26,136
Did Squeers...

1564
01:56:27,182 --> 01:56:29,045
know who the child was?

1565
01:56:30,591 --> 01:56:31,545
No.

1566
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:34,591
I told him his name was Smike.

1567
01:56:47,045 --> 01:56:48,955
Then the crippled boy...

1568
01:56:52,455 --> 01:56:53,818
is my son.

1569
01:56:54,591 --> 01:56:56,955
Was your son.

1570
01:56:58,545 --> 01:57:02,455
That boy, whose loving cheerfulness
and sweetness of heart...

1571
01:57:02,545 --> 01:57:05,682
could have been
the life-saving comfort you need...

1572
01:57:05,955 --> 01:57:08,273
as all your fortune falls away...

1573
01:57:08,591 --> 01:57:11,000
that boy now sleeps in the ground...

1574
01:57:12,682 --> 01:57:14,045
by my father.

1575
01:58:46,409 --> 01:58:49,727
Nearer and nearer draws the time

1576
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,182
the time that shall surely be

1577
01:58:53,455 --> 01:58:58,136
when the Earth shall be filled
with the glory of God

1578
01:58:59,182 --> 01:59:03,591
as the waters cover the sea

1579
01:59:11,318 --> 01:59:12,591
Ring on.

1580
01:59:16,045 --> 01:59:18,682
For births that lead to early deaths...

1581
01:59:20,864 --> 01:59:23,955
for marriages made in hell...

1582
01:59:27,045 --> 01:59:29,591
and for the coming in of every year...

1583
01:59:30,727 --> 01:59:33,682
that brings this cursed world
closer to its end.

1584
01:59:40,136 --> 01:59:42,000
Would that it had come...

1585
01:59:46,409 --> 01:59:47,727
before tonight.

1586
01:59:59,864 --> 02:00:03,955
What can we do to work God's work

1587
02:00:04,455 --> 02:00:07,955
to prosper and increase

1588
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,955
the brotherhood of all mankind

1589
02:00:12,545 --> 02:00:15,682
the reign of the Prince of Peace?

1590
02:00:21,864 --> 02:00:25,455
What can we do to hasten the time

1591
02:00:25,818 --> 02:00:29,455
the time that shall surely be

1592
02:00:30,182 --> 02:00:32,182
when the Earth shall be filled

1593
02:00:32,318 --> 02:00:36,000
with the glory of God

1594
02:00:36,955 --> 02:00:39,000
as the waters

1595
02:00:39,045 --> 02:00:42,273
cover the sea?

1596
02:00:46,682 --> 02:00:50,591
In every life, no matter how full
or empty one's purse...

1597
02:00:51,409 --> 02:00:52,955
there is tragedy.

1598
02:00:53,273 --> 02:00:56,318
It is the one promise life always fulfills.

1599
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,409
Thus, happiness is a gift...

1600
02:00:59,955 --> 02:01:04,682
and the trick is not to expect it,
but to delight in it when it comes...

1601
02:01:05,318 --> 02:01:08,000
and to add to other people's store of it.

1602
02:01:09,273 --> 02:01:11,318
What happens if, too early...

1603
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,591
we lose a parent...

1604
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,818
that party on whom we rely
for only everything?

1605
02:01:18,818 --> 02:01:21,955
What did these people do
when their families shrank?

1606
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:26,545
They cried their tears,
but then they did the vital thing:

1607
02:01:27,318 --> 02:01:31,000
They built a new family, person by person.

1608
02:01:31,455 --> 02:01:34,864
They came to see
that family need not be defined...

1609
02:01:34,864 --> 02:01:37,727
merely as those
with whom they share blood...

1610
02:01:37,864 --> 02:01:41,273
but as those for whom
they would give their blood.

1611
02:01:42,409 --> 02:01:45,864
It is in that spirit
that we offer this heartfelt toast...

1612
02:01:46,455 --> 02:01:48,545
to the brides and grooms.

1613
02:01:49,727 --> 02:01:51,455
The brides and grooms.

1614
02:02:31,182 --> 02:02:34,136
We are going to live in the old house again.

1615
02:02:34,818 --> 02:02:37,455
And we will walk and sit here every day...

1616
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,273
soon, I hope, with our children.

1617
02:02:42,545 --> 02:02:44,682
We will always be with you...

1618
02:02:45,273 --> 02:02:47,955
and you with us, dearest Father...

1619
02:02:50,182 --> 02:02:51,455
and cousin.

1620
02:02:52,305 --> 02:02:58,820
