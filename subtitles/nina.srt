2
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,502
I would like my parents

3
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:47,539
to have their seats up front.

4
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,548
Dear, the whole town
has come to see you.

5
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,451
You're brilliant.

6
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,321
You don't wanna let them down.

7
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:02,988
Okay?

8
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,026
I'm not playing unless they do.

9
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,796
Interviewer: <i>Miss Simone,
you really the first</i>

10
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,832
ever to blend jazz,

11
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,035
classical, and blues, but

12
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,904
I believe
you call it black classical.

13
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,473
Who were your
musical influences?

14
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,842
Well, of course, I was trained

15
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,878
as a classical pianist
since I was three.

16
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,515
I started at Julliard
and that's where

17
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,117
I learned about Bach and Mozart

18
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,820
and Chopin, and
those are the artists

19
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,555
that I return to, you see?

20
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:27,326
Yes, and yet you
became a club singer.

21
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:30,128
After Julliard, I was
denied entrance

22
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,231
into the Curtis institute
because I was black.

23
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,736
I'd hope to continue studying,

24
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:42,007
playing classical music,
but I was not allowed to.

25
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,444
So I went to Atlanta
to try to make

26
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,381
to try to make some money,
so that I can apply again.

27
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,618
But they didn't
want a black woman

28
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,388
to play the piano, to
play classical music.

29
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,057
They wanted her to sing
because...

30
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,761
That's what we do, isn't it?

31
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,870
Lawyer: <i>I know you've come
a long way to be here,</i>

32
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,372
<i>unfortunately,</i>

33
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,575
whatever money miss Simone felt
was owed to her

34
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:17,976
simply isn't.

35
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,778
I wish it were different,

36
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,815
but we've reviewed as many of
your contracts as we could find

37
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,651
and it looks like
the royalties to your songs

38
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,253
were sold a long time ago.

39
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,921
He stole my money and I want it.

40
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,858
I sang those songs,
I lived that life,

41
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,093
that's my porgy money
and they're taking it from me.

42
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:39,097
Nina, this is a fight we've
been fighting for years.

43
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,266
It's over.

44
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,901
What are you
talking about, Henri?

45
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,202
Just what I said, darling.

46
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,071
Tell him to give
me my fucking money.

47
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,940
Excuse us, sir, let's go.

48
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,346
Give me my money.

49
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,914
Henry: Jesus Christ, Nina!

50
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,549
You tell them to
give me my money,

51
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,317
tell him to give me my money!

52
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,646
Sorry about this.

53
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,149
Whoa whoa whoa!

54
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,818
You're not going anywhere!

55
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,956
All the way back, let's go!

56
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,791
- Nina: Hey!
- Officer: Stop resisting!

57
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,326
Nina: Let me go!

58
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,528
No, no!

59
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,301
Doctor:
<i>She's a diagnosed alcoholic,</i>

60
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,902
diagnosed manic depressive,

61
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,771
diagnosed mild paranoia,

62
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:54,639
severe dysfunction
when off medication,

63
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,842
moderate to good
function when medicated.

64
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,677
When she was brought in,

65
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,513
she had a money belt
with $8,000 in it.

66
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,849
She had to be restrained.

67
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,952
The police are placing
her on a 24 hour hold.

68
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,454
After that, it's up to
her how long she stays.

69
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,956
Nurse 1: Who is she again?

70
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,023
Nurse 2: Nina Simone.

71
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,592
Oh, I know that name.

72
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,327
Who is that?

73
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:16,895
Never heard of her.

74
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,031
Clifton: Hello, miss Simone.

75
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,533
My name is Clifton.

76
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,372
Just gonna prep
you for your shot.

77
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,774
Wait wait wait, what is that?

78
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,543
Take your medication.

79
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,312
If you do, it'll take the flag

80
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,282
off your file,
you won't be restrained

81
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,418
for meal times, showers,
or recreation.

82
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,358
Where you from?

83
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,094
Chicago.

84
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,263
Well, welcome to California.

85
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,700
It's so nice here.

86
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,070
Miss Simone.

87
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,210
Nina: Go ahead,
I'm taking my meds,

88
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,546
I'm cooperating,
I'm a good patient.

89
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,147
Nurse: There.

90
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,790
<i>Would I sell you anything,
the way I look?</i>

91
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,693
Man on TV:
<i>Honey, you're right,</i>

92
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,762
<i>you're absolutely right.</i>

93
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,131
Clifton.

94
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,437
Where's my money?

95
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,273
The money they took
from me, where is it?

96
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,608
It's in the safe
with your other stuff.

97
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,843
Can you check on it for me?

98
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,779
Uh-huh.

99
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,080
Thanks.

100
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,285
You seem better.

101
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,187
Yeah?

102
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,124
Hey.

103
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,694
You know I'm famous.

104
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,262
What?

105
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,264
Do you know who I am?

106
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:02,801
Yeah.

107
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,169
Yeah?

108
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,672
I think my mother
used to listen to you.

109
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,345
Good.

110
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,717
I hope it's okay
for me to say this,

111
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,152
but nothing's really
keeping you here,

112
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,554
I mean you can leave.

113
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,357
You should leave.

114
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,475
Hi.

115
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:46,745
Took your advice.

116
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,580
I'm leaving.

117
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,983
- Wow.
- Mmhm.

118
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,085
Good for you.

119
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,559
I want you to come with me
to France as my assistant.

120
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,096
What?

121
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,998
I will pay you $2,000 a month,

122
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,167
plus room and board.

123
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,437
In return, you take
care of all my affairs.

124
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,574
You don't believe me, do you?

125
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,425
I can't take that.

126
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,260
I can't take this.

127
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,470
Nina: Plane leaves at 9 am.

128
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,310
Nina: It's France, baby!

129
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,379
France is better.

130
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,715
Better than this.

131
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,306
Will you get some champagne
and bring it upstairs?

132
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,845
This is all I could find.

133
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,114
Come on, let me see.

134
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,057
You want me to make the bed?

135
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,593
No, I'm too tired.

136
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,981
Clifton, I need a drink!

137
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:46,184
I was clean for 30 days
in that goddamn hospital.

138
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,652
I want a drink right now.

139
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,754
There you are,
and please do my bed.

140
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,489
You've been in it all day.

141
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,892
I know that, isn't
that what you do?

142
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:55,793
Okay.

143
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:57,695
Now, please get me
something to drink first.

144
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:58,529
There's nothing here.

145
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,564
Well, then go get something!

146
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,099
You need to eat something first.

147
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,334
Listen, motherfucker,
you work for me, okay?!

148
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,436
I pay you!

149
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,673
I'm not your patient, now please

150
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,441
go get me something to drink.

151
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,176
Then come upstairs
and do my bed!

152
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,846
Champagne!

153
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:39,938
Clifton: Hi.

154
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,307
Nina: Good morning.

155
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,009
I brought you some
food and your medication.

156
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,812
I didn't ask for any of that.

157
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,448
Well, you need it,
you can't take

158
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,216
your meds on an empty stomach.

159
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,119
You shouldn't drink
on an empty stomach.

160
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,523
Since when?

161
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,168
What are you waiting for?

162
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,737
Nothing.

163
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,007
Hey, hey, hey, take it with you.

164
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,009
I told you
I don't want it, baby.

165
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,826
Nina:<i> Motherfucker!</i>

166
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,627
Nina: <i>Stop watering down
my champagne!</i>

167
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,663
<i>You don't think I could
tell the difference?!</i>

168
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,666
<i>Expensive bottle of champagne,</i>

169
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,568
<i>motherfucker putting water
in it.</i>

170
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,006
Interviewer: <i>How do you manage
to balance these</i>

171
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,274
two different things,
you have beautiful,

172
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,677
tender love songs
and very intense,

173
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,545
angry political songs.

174
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,015
When I first
started singing which,

175
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,350
as you know, I
didn't want to do,

176
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,186
but I had to so that
I can make money,

177
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,323
back then I only sang about love

178
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,091
because I didn't
have it as a child.

179
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,661
Of course I'm black, so I had
to sing about that too.

180
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,132
And then I had to sing
about them both.

181
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,467
That's the only explanation
I have for that.

182
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,747
- Hi.
- Hi.

183
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,151
What is that?

184
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,652
Lunch.

185
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,421
You don't give up, do you?

186
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,889
I don't want lunch!

187
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,791
I want a drink, not that.

188
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,726
All right, well I'll
just leave it here.

189
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,927
No, take it with you.

190
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,063
Pills.

191
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,497
Don't want them.

192
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,067
Clifton: Make
sure you eat first!

193
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,817
I'll eat.

194
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,254
But I'm not gonna
take the drugs.

195
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,424
I don't like the way
they make me feel, baby.

196
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,992
They stabilize you.

197
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,928
I don't wanna be stabilized.

198
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,831
I wanna feel free, really free.

199
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,633
You can understand that.

200
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,870
Yeah I do, Nina.

201
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:27,672
I do.

202
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,642
All right.

203
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,012
All right.

204
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,681
Clifton: Nina.

205
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,318
What?

206
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,653
You have a daughter, right?

207
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,389
From your first marriage?

208
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,892
Yes I do.

209
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,027
Clifton: Where is she?

210
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,697
She's in New York.

211
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,832
She's grown now.

212
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,028
Nina:<i> Test.</i>

213
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,998
<i>This song is inspired by</i>

214
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,835
the most talented,
elegant playwright,

215
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:49,707
miss Lorraine "raisin
in the sun" Hansberry.

216
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:54,412
My muse, my
inspiration, my friend.

217
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,315
Baby, I wrote it for you.

218
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,918
No, you wrote it
because you had to.

219
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,988
Yes.

220
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,728
Come here.

221
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,258
Hello?

222
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:16,694
Henri: <i>This is Henri Edwards,
I'm Nina's manager.</i>

223
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,928
Oh, hey.

224
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,230
Henri: <i>I got
an offer from a club</i>

225
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,898
<i>in Paris for next Friday.</i>

226
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,068
<i>It'll pay a lot of money,
so make sure she's ready.</i>

227
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,670
She's not in any
condition yet to perform.

228
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,174
She's drinking, not
taking her medication.

229
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,809
Very volatile.

230
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,445
Henri: <i>Know that,
that's what she is.</i>

231
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:35,880
<i>She's a fucked up
alcoholic drug addict,</i>

232
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,682
<i>but people will still
pay money to see her.</i>

233
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,551
<i>I'll fax you the details, huh?</i>

234
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:41,952
<i>Make sure you get her there.</i>

235
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,028
This fucking manager
hands me a set list.

236
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,698
14 songs, I have to play
five, maybe six songs,

237
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,567
14 would take us
an hour and a half,

238
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:58,602
maybe even two, but it's
fucking Nina Simone, man.

239
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,870
I'm not gonna show this to her

240
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,192
because she will
actually kill me.

241
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,908
You know what, you
show it to her.

242
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,483
Just fucking do something, ,

243
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:13,818
I really do wish you good luck

244
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,919
'cause you're gonna
fucking need it.

245
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,120
Shit.

246
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,965
Man: This is for you?

247
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:33,971
Hi, Mr. Edwards, I'm Clifton,
Nina's assistant.

248
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,140
- Hi.
- Is Nina ready?

249
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,811
It's the playlist.

250
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,979
What?

251
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:43,914
It's too long for Nina.

252
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,016
She's acting up again?

253
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,320
The band isn't happy either.

254
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,856
Man: If they're not happy...

255
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,359
She'll be fine.

256
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,761
No, she won't.

257
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,198
Listen, if she cannot perform
an hour half, it's on you.

258
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,633
She's been performing
for 20 years.

259
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,101
She can do 10 songs.

260
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:07,037
It's 14, it's 14 songs.

261
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,440
Clifton, is that your name?

262
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:10,574
Clifton: Yeah.

263
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,613
Don't even pretend you have
the balls to stand up to me.

264
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,915
Or to her.

265
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,050
You take the playlist,
you put it on the piano,

266
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,519
you put her
in front of the piano,

267
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:24,088
you tell the band
to shut the fuck up.

268
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,094
What you don't understand
is she needs this gig.

269
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:32,596
Don't blow it for her.

270
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:34,899
Okay?

271
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,208
Nina!

272
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,327
- What are you doing?!
- Talk now, motherfucker!

273
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,649
My time here is over!

274
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,184
It's all fucking done!

275
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,886
Singing to corpses!

276
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,623
What are you looking at?!

277
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,191
Talk now, motherfuckers!

278
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,049
Clifton: You okay?

279
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,154
Thanks for taking your meds.

280
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,529
What happened, Nina?

281
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,933
Why are you here
and not in America?

282
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,337
Why do you keep your
money under your mattress

283
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,005
and not in a bank account?

284
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,147
Why are you playing

285
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,115
in front of 100 people
and not 20,000?

286
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,186
Too much loss.

287
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:16,860
I lost my family, my
people, my country,

288
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,530
my money, my dreams.

289
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,599
I lost it all.

290
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,108
Don't be afraid of me.

291
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,251
Interviewer: <i>You've been
an ex-patriot since 1970.</i>

292
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,321
Nina: <i>Being an
outspoken black woman,</i>

293
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,156
<i>I feared for my life in America.</i>

294
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,392
<i>That was my feeling then,</i>

295
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,095
but now I realize it's
only normal to want

296
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:53,797
acceptance for
one's own country,

297
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,834
for ones gifts that
god has given you.

298
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,770
And I'm tired of begging for it.

299
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,939
But you do get a lot of love

300
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,440
when you perform though,
I mean people,

301
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,775
of course they love you.

302
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:07,311
Yeah, I do, I get a lot of love.

303
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,812
But not enough.

304
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:31,702
Come on, wake up.

305
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,638
Wake up.

306
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,508
Let's go to nice.

307
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,645
You should see me in nice.

308
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,213
I'm a star in nice, come on.

309
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,048
Yes, yes, yes, let's go!

310
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,484
Come on, go!

311
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,705
This is my Clifton.

312
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,910
My dear friends,
let's make a toast.

313
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,344
To friends.

314
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:15,646
Guests: Cheers.

315
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:16,947
And to gatherings.

316
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,315
I only got water.

317
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,852
It's okay, you can toast
with whatever you want, baby.

318
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:23,854
You're with me.

319
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:28,525
Nina Simone.

320
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,564
Merci, Merci.

321
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,172
I'm shy.

322
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,418
All right.

323
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:56,928
Want me to take your shoes off?

324
00:30:58,457 --> 00:30:59,623
Take it off.

325
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,258
Nina.

326
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,426
Baby, come on, stop
with the bullshit

327
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:03,861
and just fuck me
already, come on.

328
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,095
- Nina, stop.
- Come on.

329
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,898
Stop.

330
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,470
Go get me Stefan
from the bar downstairs.

331
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,206
Go, faggot.

332
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,308
Get me a real man.

333
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,330
There's this beautiful
black boy in the valley.

334
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,807
Ask him if he'd like to
have dinner with us tonight.

335
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,673
Whatever you say.

336
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,581
Cheers.

337
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,737
Where the hell have you been?

338
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,339
I've been calling you.

339
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,110
What, are you packed already?

340
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:35,946
I'm not going back with you.

341
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,484
I'm gonna go get the bellhop.

342
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:41,785
I'm going home to Chicago.

343
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:43,787
- You're not going to Chicago.
- Clifton: Yes, I am.

344
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,155
We have a contract,

345
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:46,790
you don't break the contract.

346
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,725
Doesn't include
me being your pimp.

347
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:52,095
Pimp?

348
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,698
Think I need a pimp?

349
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,301
- Hmm?
- No.

350
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,370
I don't think you need a pimp.

351
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,944
Don't go, Clifton.

352
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,447
Take care.

353
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:13,784
Don't go.

354
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,155
Clifton!

355
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,657
Clifton.

356
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,011
Nina: Hello?

357
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,648
Cousier: <i>Nina,
it's doctor Cousier.</i>

358
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:32,515
Uh huh.

359
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,231
Cousier:<i> I've called you</i>
several times

360
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,133
<i>over the last few months and...</i>

361
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:37,687
<i>You need to know.</i>

362
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,824
<i>The results of the
biopsy are serious.</i>

363
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:42,886
<i>We need to do
something about it.</i>

364
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:44,828
<i>We need to do it soon.</i>

365
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,429
Okay.

366
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,353
Cousier: <i>You must
come in to see me, please.</i>

367
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,502
Bye.

368
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:17,661
Are you still sleeping?

369
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:20,664
It's 11 o'clock.

370
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,434
What about that job interview?

371
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:25,669
Did you go on it?

372
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:27,270
Not yet.

373
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:33,843
Yeah?

374
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,013
Shut the front door.

375
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:45,355
This where Clifton grew up?

376
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:49,025
Well, it's where the Clifton
tried to grow up.

377
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,162
Clifton's a good boy.

378
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,064
He is.

379
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,267
I just can't believe
you are in our house.

380
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,004
You know, I have all your music.

381
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,872
I do.

382
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:04,674
Growing up,
Clifton must've heard

383
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,676
these records a million times.

384
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,512
Nina Simone at Carnegie hall

385
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,880
and Nina Simone...

386
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:12,582
Let me see that.

387
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,285
I haven't seen this
in a long time.

388
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:17,253
Mother: <i>Nina Simone:
Silk and soul.</i>

389
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,423
This one.

390
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,295
I never ever took this
one off my record player.

391
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:27,731
It's got the song "four women".

392
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:31,935
Mom.

393
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,005
Mom, stop.

394
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,674
Honey.

395
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:41,211
This has got the song on
it that kept us marching.

396
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,746
"Mississippi".

397
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,616
Made me believe that
we had a chance.

398
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,153
Until we didn't.

399
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,557
President on TV: <i>America
is shocked and saddened</i>

400
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,260
by the brutal slaying tonight

401
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,496
<i>of doctor Martin Luther King.</i>

402
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,332
<i>I ask every citizen</i>

403
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,602
<i>to reject the blind violence</i>

404
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,271
<i>that has struck doctor king</i>

405
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:12,776
<i>who lived by nonviolence.</i>

406
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,078
Nina: Those motherfuckers.

407
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,914
Nina, what are you doing?

408
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,682
- I'mma kill them all.
- What are you doing?

409
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,184
What do you think I'm doing?

410
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:22,185
- The fuck you think I'm doing?!
- Nina, stop!

411
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:23,353
Stop, Nina!

412
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,688
Do what you do.

413
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,125
You do what you do.

414
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,995
You wanna have
dinner with me tonight?

415
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,430
- Mom: That sounds so nice.
- Mom.

416
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,831
Mom: Thank you.

417
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,000
Dad: Yeah, it
would be our pleasure,

418
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,735
and I know just the place.

419
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:57,947
I'm gonna sing a song for you.

420
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,949
All right, all right.

421
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,920
Clifton, go tell
them I want to sing.

422
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:12,962
Well, you're my manager.

423
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,499
I wanted to wait

424
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,261
until the entire family
was here to tell you.

425
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,603
Clifton is now my manager.

426
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,539
Shit, boy.

427
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:24,307
That's good, congratulations.

428
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:25,775
Why do you think
I came all this way?

429
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,177
You're now my manager.

430
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:37,453
Let's see if they recognize me.

431
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,192
Musician: Check that out, man.

432
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:48,264
Musician: Ladies and gentlemen,

433
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,033
it looks like we have
a legend in the house.

434
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:52,068
Nina Simone is here, and I think

435
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,937
she wants to do
something with us.

436
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,328
Musician: Nina Simone!

437
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,130
Nina Simone, people!

438
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:28,665
Mom: That gave me the chills!

439
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,500
Dad: That was really
something, miss Simone.

440
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:32,135
Mom: I love that song!

441
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:33,569
Dad: That was
really something, huh?

442
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:35,271
What you think?

443
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,440
Well, you played beautiful.

444
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,378
Is that what you think?

445
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,946
That you put a spell on me?

446
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:48,718
That's not enough.

447
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,691
He's already talking
like a manager.

448
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,362
A toast.

449
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,532
To Clifton Henderson,
the manager.

450
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,133
- Mom: To Clifton.
- Dad: To my son.

451
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,402
I'm happy he's got a job.

452
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,614
What's going on, Clifton?

453
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:21,718
What do you mean?

454
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,388
I mean what's going on?

455
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:29,659
Nothing's going on.

456
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,328
Nina Simone followed you

457
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,030
all the way here
from France, so come on baby,

458
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:36,733
you gonna tell me there
ain't nothing going on?

459
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,634
That's what I'm
telling you, nothing.

460
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:43,106
Mom: Well, from what
I see, she needs you.

461
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,261
Baby, no, no, no, please, I have

462
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,764
a headache all over my head.

463
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,170
Bring me some Nutella
and a spoon please.

464
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:34,657
What are you looking for?

465
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:36,492
Don't sneak up on me like that!

466
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,060
Where are my earrings?!

467
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,163
I have them.

468
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:41,430
You're lying!

469
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:42,665
You gave them to me

470
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,928
when we went through
the metal detector, remember?

471
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,373
Oh.

472
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,082
What am I supposed to manage?

473
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,019
What are you talking about?

474
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:05,721
Why am I back here, Nina?

475
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:11,928
I won't make it.

476
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:15,398
Yes you will.

477
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,600
You don't understand.

478
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:18,734
Then tell me.

479
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:25,007
It's so damn bright
in here, Clifton.

480
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:28,277
What is it with you and this
damn light all the time?!

481
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,013
I put the sheets up,
you take them down!

482
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,715
I don't like so much sunlight!

483
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:37,854
Nina.

484
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:41,524
I can make this happen,

485
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:44,760
but I need your help.

486
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,731
No.

487
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:53,636
I'll try.

488
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,380
Allison:<i> Hello?</i>

489
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,048
Hi, my name is
Clifton Henderson,

490
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,017
I represent Nina
Simone, I was calling...

491
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,185
Allison:<i> Fuck Nina Simone!</i>

492
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:10,486
<i>The last time she was here</i>

493
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,322
<i>is the last time
she will ever be here!</i>

494
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:14,964
<i>Tell that fucking diva
she can suck my...</i>

495
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:18,294
Craig:<i> Hello?</i>

496
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:22,124
Hi, this is Clifton Henderson,
I represent Nina Simone, i...

497
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:26,402
Nina: <i>Clifton, I can't find
any cigarettes!</i>

498
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,144
Mr. Edwards, thanks
for meeting me.

499
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:38,014
I appreciate it.

500
00:48:42,854 --> 00:48:45,922
As you probably know,
I'm Nina's manager now.

501
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,457
I heard, congratulations.

502
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:51,594
You know how much money I made
in the last five years?

503
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,429
Fucking nothing.

504
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,265
You're not gonna be her
manager, you're her nurse.

505
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,435
She's in bad shape physically,
financially, and mentally.

506
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:00,803
I understand that.

507
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:04,440
But here's my problem.

508
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,610
Locally, I just can't
get anyone to book her.

509
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,478
Henri: That's no surprise.

510
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,216
Look, I love her,
and she knows it.

511
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:17,954
But she's just not
a good investment.

512
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:21,958
Look, there's no
question a lot of people

513
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,261
wanna see Nina
Simone perform, me included.

514
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:26,495
I had a thought.

515
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:32,668
I was thinking about her going
back home to the states

516
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,538
and doing a free concert
in central park.

517
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,307
Bring the people back to her.

518
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,575
What do you think?

519
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,010
Henri: Central park?

520
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:43,946
Who do you think she
is, Barbra Streisand?

521
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:45,147
Why not?

522
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:46,749
Are you sleeping with her?

523
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,720
No.

524
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:52,722
All right.

525
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,578
Look, I'm not gonna help you,
there's nothing in it for me.

526
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,595
She's mean, crazy, drinks,

527
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,897
smokes, out of shape.

528
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,000
I understand.

529
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:05,668
Henri: Even her
voice isn't what it was.

530
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,071
All I need from
you is some advice.

531
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:14,343
She has to deliver truth again.

532
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,680
If she does, she can
do whatever she wants.

533
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:18,914
She's Nina Simone.

534
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,552
That's my advice, clean her up.

535
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:36,632
Clifton: Hey.

536
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:38,567
Hey, did you bring my ice cream?

537
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,735
Rum raisin?

538
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,437
No. How you feeling?

539
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,773
Nina: I'm fine. No ice cream?

540
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:48,911
Wanna go to the gym?

541
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,213
No!

542
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,381
Come on.

543
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:56,552
Like this, it's good
for your diaphragm.

544
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:03,159
Where are we going?

545
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,227
Nowhere. We're just walking.

546
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,529
That's stupid.

547
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,997
It's good for your heart.

548
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,331
Like that's gonna fix it.

549
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:13,636
I need a cigarette.

550
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,807
It's too sunny, I'm leaving.

551
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:19,975
Clifton: Nina!

552
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:24,246
That's it, all the
way back, here we go.

553
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,481
You got it.

554
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:33,189
Clifton: Where are you going?!

555
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:34,290
I'm exercising.

556
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:36,192
On my own.

557
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,433
Miss Laroche?

558
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,768
Hello, Mr. Henderson.

559
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,002
Hi, Clifton.

560
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:48,838
Come in.

561
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,374
Laroche: Miss Simone,
it's great to meet you.

562
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,510
It truly is.

563
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,152
So how do we get started?

564
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:06,055
Laroche:
Well, Mr. Henderson said

565
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:08,057
you just want
to get your voice in shape

566
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,126
and increase its
endurance and...

567
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,460
Who's paying you?

568
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:16,966
You are.

569
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,134
No, I'm not.

570
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:22,538
Stop this crap.

571
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:25,574
I told you get me a stage,
I will do the rest.

572
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,492
Clifton: Bonjour, this
is Clifton Henderson,

573
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,094
I represent Nina Simone.

574
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:46,495
Man on the phone:
<i>Is she sober?</i>

575
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,930
Of course she's sober.

576
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:48,964
No I'm not.

577
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:50,332
Man:<i> Because what I've heard is</i>

578
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:52,668
<i>she's still impossible
and sounds like shit.</i>

579
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,602
Clifton: No, no,
she sounds great.

580
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:54,503
<i>Yeah right, listen, I'm gonna</i>

581
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,038
<i>tell you something important.</i>

582
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,674
<i>Lose my fucking number
and never call here again!</i>

583
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,812
Hi, I represent
Nina Simone, I'm...

584
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:06,015
Woman:<i> Oh, we love her!</i>

585
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,650
<i>- Nina Simone!</i>
- Yeah.

586
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:09,351
Woman: <i>Will you please
hold a moment?</i>

587
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,519
Yeah, I'll hold.

588
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,954
Woman:<i> I will get our calendar.</i>

589
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:19,428
Clifton: Nina!

590
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,098
Nina, we gotta go.

591
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,134
Get in the water with me.
Come swim with me.

592
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:26,869
Nope, gotta go.

593
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,971
I don't wanna go,
you're such an old man.

594
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,105
Come on!

595
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,577
This is helping my headache.

596
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,080
We gotta go.

597
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:40,516
I worked really
hard to get this, Nina,

598
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,084
come on, out of the pool.

599
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,053
Okay.

600
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:45,821
Clifton: We have to go.

601
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:53,495
Ladies and
gentlemen, Nina Simone.

602
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:05,374
When you sing,

603
00:59:06,477 --> 00:59:07,876
I've never seen
anything like it.

604
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:12,781
Never felt anything
like it, I mean...

605
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:18,954
You're different.

606
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,989
You're just different.

607
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,224
I'm not different.

608
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,825
Yes you are.

609
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:25,561
Nina: I'm not different!
You think I'm different?

610
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,930
Do I look different to you?

611
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:32,200
I am me!

612
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,200
And the only time
anybody can ever deal with me

613
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:35,571
is when my power
is channeled through my music!

614
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,272
That's too motherfucking bad.

615
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,475
I know who I am,
I'm a black woman!

616
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:42,911
That's who I am.

617
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,181
I'm not different, motherfucker.

618
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:49,484
You're different.

619
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,086
You're pretty.

620
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:09,938
I'm sorry.

621
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,412
Many of your songs
are about freedom,

622
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:20,949
and I wonder, what
is freedom to you?

623
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:22,985
I'll tell you what
freedom means to me.

624
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,453
No fear.

625
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,123
I mean really,

626
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:30,792
no fear.

627
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:38,867
If I could have that half
of my life, no fear...

628
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:46,074
Interviewer: What are you
afraid of?

629
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,089
Hello?

630
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,659
How are you, lover?

631
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,827
Richard: <i>Nina,
can you imagine?</i>

632
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:09,331
First I've lit my shit
up with this crack pipe.

633
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:13,402
Now, this ms shit
is fucking me up.

634
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,139
Something's gotta get us, baby.

635
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:19,041
Richard: <i>Yeah, but
this shit is crazy.</i>

636
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:23,345
Man, I miss being on stage

637
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:28,350
<i>even though I was so scared
all the time, remember?</i>

638
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:31,353
Nina:<i> Yeah, I remember.</i>

639
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,707
Announcer:
<i>Village gate is proud</i>

640
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:54,543
<i>to present a very
talented lineup tonight</i>

641
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:57,713
<i>of music and soul!</i>

642
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:00,882
<i>But first, our young comedian
out of Illinois,</i>

643
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,752
<i>Mr. Richard Pryor!</i>

644
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:12,594
When you see a woman
standing across the hallway

645
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:14,096
and she's got a cigarette,

646
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:15,697
and you wanna light it,

647
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:18,066
but you forgot
where you put your matches,

648
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,401
and you're...

649
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:24,806
- Right?

650
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:29,344
I miss that shit,
I love it, man.

651
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:31,513
But enough about me.

652
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:32,981
<i>What's new with you, baby?</i>

653
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,450
I met a boy.
I have a boy with me.

654
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,020
You got the boys,
you got the girls.

655
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:42,357
He's different.

656
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:44,793
He doesn't drink.

657
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:48,263
He'll never hit me.

658
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,233
That means he's not fucking you.

659
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,471
You're right, he's not.

660
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,508
Nina: He takes care of me.

661
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,110
I keep pushing him away though.

662
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,114
Nina, you're
scared of something.

663
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:10,886
I am.

664
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:16,958
Clifton!

665
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,026
Clifton:<i> Yeah!</i>

666
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,694
Where are you?

667
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:21,897
Clifton: Right here.

668
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:26,968
Get me a studio.

669
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,570
I want to record some music.

670
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,506
Yeah.

671
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:33,909
Yup.

672
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,779
Hey guys.

673
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:39,047
Man: Hey.

674
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,317
Man: Hi, Nina.

675
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:50,926
- Yeah.
- At the chart, yeah?

676
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,494
- Okay.
- It's good to see you.

677
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:53,995
It's good to see you too.

678
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:55,664
- I hope it good to be seen.
- Thank you for coming.

679
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:58,533
Yes, yes, wanna start?

680
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,036
Man: Miss Simone.

681
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,674
Need anything?

682
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,242
- No, I'm good.
- All right.

683
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:15,016
Keep your eyes on me.

684
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,220
Just watch me when we start

685
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:19,621
and you're gonna be all right.

686
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:25,260
From the top.

687
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:43,311
So, we'll take it from the top.

688
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:51,253
Nothing too big.

689
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,956
...over here.

690
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,495
Okay boys, how's the
sound in the booth?

691
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:02,163
Sound technician:
<i>Sounds great, Nina.</i>

692
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:19,547
Oh.

693
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:20,849
Baby, it's okay.

694
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:25,687
You're used to me already?

695
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,490
Think that would be impossible.

696
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,004
You were great tonight.

697
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:47,042
It was fun.

698
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:48,043
So much fun.

699
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:49,144
Dance with me.

700
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,314
What?

701
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:54,082
You wouldn't swim
with me, dance with me.

702
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:57,585
...What, here?

703
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:58,687
Why not?

704
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:01,456
Okay.

705
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:09,030
Okay.

706
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:29,084
There's no music.

707
01:06:29,686 --> 01:06:31,019
We heard music all day.

708
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:41,696
Thank you for the dance.

709
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:51,823
Hello?

710
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:53,584
Cousier: <i>Hello,
I'm looking for Nina Simone.</i>

711
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,310
Who's this?

712
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:57,245
Cousier:
<i>This is doctor Cousier.</i>

713
01:06:58,281 --> 01:06:59,381
<i>Is she there?</i>

714
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:02,050
She's here, but she's busy.

715
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:03,585
Can she call you back?

716
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:07,889
Cousier: <i>Well, she was supposed
to call me back and did not.</i>

717
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:09,290
<i>It's important.</i>

718
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,329
Well, I take care
of all of Nina's affairs.

719
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:15,730
You can talk to me.

720
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,633
Cousier:<i> Okay, well then</i>

721
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,268
<i>there's certain things
you should know.</i>

722
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:31,046
Nina: I felt so
good after recording.

723
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,583
Why didn't you tell me?

724
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:36,818
Tell you what?

725
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:40,622
That was your doctor
on the phone.

726
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,592
A doctor I didn't know you had.

727
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:46,895
You were supposed
to come back in

728
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,730
to start your fucking treatment?

729
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,065
It's my life, Clifton.

730
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:51,433
It always has been.

731
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,402
If 30 years of alcohol, drugs,
and mental illness

732
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,004
have not killed me, this won't.

733
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,342
What?

734
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,278
I don't get it.

735
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:06,881
I have seen you go ballistic

736
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:08,750
over your pasta
not being al dente.

737
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:14,322
Would it make you
feel better if I did?

738
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:17,158
I'm tired, Clifton.

739
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:20,762
My pasta means more to me
than this fucking bullshit.

740
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,102
But I do like your
central park idea.

741
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:37,712
- Cousier: How are you?
- Good.

742
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:42,350
So...

743
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:46,020
Can I travel?

744
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,189
Where, and for how long?

745
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:51,659
America for a week?

746
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:54,162
A month?

747
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:58,099
Nina, the situation is critical.

748
01:08:58,101 --> 01:09:01,503
You waited a long time
to come in, too long.

749
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:04,506
You need surgery, Nina,
and you need it soon.

750
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:06,407
Do you understand?

751
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:09,711
Does it matter?

752
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:12,914
Really?

753
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:15,517
It matters to me.

754
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,586
And it matters to the people
who love you.

755
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:40,375
Cousier:<i> Scalpel.</i>

756
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,192
Around here is
a slight infection

757
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,360
started from the iv,
I just wanna watch it.

758
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,532
No, it's okay.

759
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:05,700
We'll watch it.

760
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,436
Yeah, but it is infected.

761
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:10,905
How do you know this?

762
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:14,108
I'm a nurse.

763
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:44,639
Clifton: We'll
get through this.

764
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:46,941
You're the strongest
woman I know.

765
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,314
Interviewer: <i>You
are a strong voice</i>

766
01:10:52,549 --> 01:10:53,881
<i>in the fight against
racial inequality.</i>

767
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:55,783
In fact, Eldridge cleaver
once said

768
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:57,685
that you are the soundtrack

769
01:10:57,687 --> 01:10:59,454
for the civil rights
movement in America.

770
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,422
Can you talk about
that a little?

771
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:04,292
Well, darling, I've had my heart

772
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:06,294
broken many times, and the death

773
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:08,396
of Martin Luther King
and of that movement

774
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:09,964
was one of them.

775
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,599
Why do you say that?

776
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,301
Do you feel the movement failed?

777
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:18,039
No, no I don't, I think
the United States failed.

778
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:23,211
My country failed my people,
my people failed me,

779
01:11:23,213 --> 01:11:24,846
and that's why I'm here.

780
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:27,315
Interviewer: Well, it
is our gain, I must say.

781
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:39,721
Quiet.

782
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:56,971
- That's good.
- Ow.

783
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,206
Okay, I gotta go.

784
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:00,908
I'll see you in a few hours.

785
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:03,544
I'm going to the pharmacy.

786
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:19,654
Girl on the tape:
<i>Hello, miss Simone.</i>

787
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,489
<i>My mother recently passed away.</i>

788
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:23,124
<i>I just wanted you to know how</i>

789
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,859
<i>important your music was to her.</i>

790
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,995
<i>I'm sending you a picture
you autographed for her</i>

791
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:29,997
<i>and a necklace
she used to wear back then.</i>

792
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:32,333
<i>This was my mother's
favorite song.</i>

793
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:34,869
<i>I made this for her
before she died.</i>

794
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:21,569
Girl on the tape: <i>Thank you
for all you meant to my mother.</i>

795
01:17:21,571 --> 01:17:23,471
<i>I hope you'll play
in America again.</i>

796
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:25,039
<i>I'd like to see you.</i>

797
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,166
Nina!

798
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:06,447
So, how are you feeling?

799
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:10,184
I'm broke.

800
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:14,622
I see, so you want
me to manage you again.

801
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:16,857
No.

802
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,293
Clifton's my manager.

803
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:20,628
So why are you here?

804
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:24,265
I wanna play in America again.

805
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,068
Clifton secured central park.

806
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:28,335
Aha, I see.

807
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:29,503
Nina: But he needs collateral.

808
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:30,604
Sure, I could help,

809
01:18:30,973 --> 01:18:32,453
I could make a call,
but why should I?

810
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:35,616
All the promoters think you're
a five star asshole, Nina.

811
01:18:40,349 --> 01:18:42,616
What does that have to do
with playing music, Henri?

812
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,618
Nothing, if you wanna play
in your living room,

813
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:47,154
you can be as big
an asshole you want there.

814
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,725
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm not saying no,

815
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:52,560
I'm saying show me
that you give a shit,

816
01:18:52,562 --> 01:18:54,595
show me you're
not gonna knife someone,

817
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:56,130
that you can handle it.

818
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,933
Nina: I can handle it!

819
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:01,268
Okay, okay, when
do you wanna play?

820
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:39,507
Clifton: There are
thousands of people out there.

821
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:41,342
