00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,832
I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.

3
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,933
Hard to believe.

4
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,502
My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

5
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:53,351
Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.

6
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,354
I think he's pretty proud of that.

7
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,956
I know I was.

8
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,960
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

9
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,658
Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,360
That's the younger Jim.

11
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,895
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.

12
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,464
I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.

13
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,535
Never missed a chance to do so.

14
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:24,174
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,084
Can't help but wonder
how they'd have operated these times.

16
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:33,023
There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.

17
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,426
My arrest and my testimony.

18
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,100
He killed a 14-year-old girl.

19
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,658
Paper said it was a crime of passion,

20
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,603
but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.

21
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,905
Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.

22
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:53,878
Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.

23
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,541
Said he knew he was going to hell.

24
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,016
Be there in about 15 minutes.

25
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,883
I don't know what to make of that.

26
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,185
I sure do don't.

27
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:09,987
The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.

28
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,725
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

29
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:18,500
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

30
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,871
But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out

31
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,400
and meet something I don't understand.

32
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,883
A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.

33
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,648
He'd have to say, "OK.

34
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,820
I'll be part of this world. "

35
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,261
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

36
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,426
He had some sort of thing on him,

37
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,063
like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something,

38
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,471
and a hose that run down his sleeve.

39
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,067
Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?

40
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,908
You got me. Well,
you can look at it when you get in.

41
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,417
- I'll be down there in a bit.
- Yes, sir, I got it under control.

42
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,174
- Howdy. What's this about?
- Step out of the car please, sir.

43
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,446
What is that?

44
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,886
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

45
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,690
- What is that for?
- Would you...?

46
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,792
Would you hold still please, sir?

47
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,793
You hold still.

48
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,737
Shit.

49
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,955
Agua.

50
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,018
Agua.

51
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,867
Agua.

52
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,709
I ain't got no water.

53
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,843
Agua.

54
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,480
Agua.

55
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,823
I told you I ain't got no agua.

56
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,003
Do you speak English?

57
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,379
Where's the last guy?

58
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:20,181
Último hombre, last man standing. There
must have been one. Where'd he go?

59
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,426
I reckon I go out the way I come in.

60
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,591
Hay lobos.

61
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,030
There ain't no lobos.

62
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,810
You stopped to watch
your backtrack.

63
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,721
Now shoot my dumb ass.

64
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,594
But if you stop,

65
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,655
you stopped in shade.

66
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,880
Yeah.

67
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,993
Hmm.

68
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,925
Mmm.

69
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,956
My place is wrong?

70
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,620
Yours is the first place
Danzer and Dora will look if they...

71
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,687
If they know.

72
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,796
- What's in the satchel?
- It's full of money.

73
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,100
That would be the day.

74
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,936
- Where'd you get the pistol?
- at the gettin' place.

75
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:40,439
- Did you buy that gun?
- No. I found it.

76
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,843
- Llewelyn.
- What? Quit your hollering.

77
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,443
What'd you get for that thing?

78
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,822
You don't need to know everything,
Carla Jean.

79
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,293
- I need to know that.
- Keep running that mouth of yours,

80
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,990
I'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

81
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,158
- Big talk.
- Keep it up.

82
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,328
Fine. I don't want to know.

83
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,363
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

84
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,170
That'll work.

85
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,852
All right.

86
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,997
- Llewelyn?
- Yeah?

87
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,670
- What're you doing, baby?
- I'm going out.

88
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,900
Going where?

89
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,876
A little something I forgot to do,
but I'll be back.

90
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,278
- And what're you gonna do?
- I'm fixing to do something

91
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,579
dumber than hell, but I'm going anyways.

92
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,187
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

93
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,389
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

94
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,759
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

95
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,290
- How much?
- Sixty-nine cents.

96
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,851
And the gas?

97
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,454
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

98
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,729
- What way would that be?
- Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

99
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,800
What business is it of yours
where I'm from...

100
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,401
...friendo?

101
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,072
- Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?

102
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,516
I was just passing the time.

103
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,655
If you don't want to accept that,
I don't know what else I can do for you.

104
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,130
- Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?

105
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,402
- Is something wrong?
- With what?

106
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,871
With anything.

107
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:54,105
Is that what you're asking me?
Is there something wrong with anything?

108
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,615
- Will there be anything else?
- You already asked me that.

109
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,546
- Well, I need to see about closing now.
- See about closing?

110
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,557
- Yes, sir.
- What time do you close?

111
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,889
- Now. We close now.
- Now is not a time.

112
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,090
- What time do you close?
- Generally around dark. at dark.

113
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,898
You don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

114
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,063
Sir?

115
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,802
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

116
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,875
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?

117
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,543
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?
I said, what time do you go to bed?

118
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,255
Oh.

119
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,485
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

120
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,118
I could come back then.

121
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,629
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

122
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,460
Yeah, you said that.

123
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,262
- Well, I got to close now.
- You live in that house out back?

124
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,404
- Yes, I do.
- You lived here all your life?

125
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:03,074
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

126
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,777
You married into it?

127
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:10,754
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

128
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,784
Raised a family there. In Temple.

129
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,956
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?

130
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:24,263
- If that's the way you want to put it.
- Well, I don't have some way to put it.

131
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,065
That's the way it is.

132
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:37,079
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

133
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:42,143
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

134
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,781
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't say.

135
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,183
- Call it.
- Call it?

136
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,389
- Yes.
- For what?

137
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,692
Just call it.

138
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,934
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

139
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,441
You need to call it.
I can't call it for you.

140
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,602
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- I didn't put nothing up.

141
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:10,205
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.

142
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,648
You just didn't know it.

143
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,743
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

144
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:20,121
1958. It's been traveling
22 years to get here.

145
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:24,925
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.

146
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,361
You have to say. Call it.

147
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,867
Well, look,
I need to know what I stand to win.

148
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,768
- Everything.
- How's that?

149
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:35,432
You stand to win everything. Call it.

150
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,945
All right. Heads, then.

151
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:48,980
Well done.

152
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,083
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?

153
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,218
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

154
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,252
Where do you want me to put it?

155
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,457
Anywhere not in your pocket.

156
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:04,992
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

157
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,598
Which it is.

158
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,850
Llewelyn?

159
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,453
What the hell?

160
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,822
- Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

161
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:34,332
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

162
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,696
Well, how come?

163
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:40,033
Look, right now it's midnight Sunday.
Courthouse opens nine hours from now.

164
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:44,201
Someone's gonna call in the number
on the inspection plate of my truck.

165
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,540
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

166
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,171
- How long do we...?
- What point would you quit

167
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,444
bothering to look
for your two million dollars?

168
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,712
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

169
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,448
Stand in the door and holler,
"Mama, I'm home!"?

170
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,820
- Llewelyn.
- Come on, pack your things.

171
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,724
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

172
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:07,954
Well, don't fall down apologizing.

173
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,263
Oh, baby, things happen.

174
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,194
Come on, I can't take them back.

175
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,622
Mind riding bitch?

176
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,840
- This his truck?
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,712
Got a screwgie?

178
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:06,483
- Who cut his tires?
- Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

179
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,455
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

180
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:16,725
- Where's the receiver?
- I've got it.

181
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,701
These are some ripe petunias.

182
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,637
Hold this, please.

183
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,212
Want it?

184
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,947
- Getting anything on this?
- Not a bleep.

185
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,718
All right.

186
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,219
Give me that.

187
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,733
- I thought it was a car afire.
- It is a car afire.

188
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,266
Wendell said there's something
in the back country too.

189
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,334
Step in there.

190
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,405
When's the county gonna start
paying rent on my horse?

191
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,576
- I love you more and more every day.
- That's very nice.

192
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,581
- Be careful.
- Always am.

193
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,350
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

194
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,289
Don't hurt no one.

195
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,392
If you say so.

196
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:56,430
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,864
We should've brought wienies.

198
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,872
That look like about
a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

199
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,171
- It could be.
- I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

200
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:10,237
- The old boy shot by the highway?
- Yes, sir. His vehicle.

201
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:14,513
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway,

202
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:20,024
swapped for his car, now here it is and
he's swapped again for God knows what.

203
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,491
That's very linear, sheriff.

204
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,725
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,891
- Then there's this other.
- Yeah.

206
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,164
- You ride Winston.
- You sure?

207
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:37,504
Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything
happens to Loretta's horse out here,

208
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:41,033
I can tell you, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

209
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:45,981
It's the same tire tread coming back as
going. Made about the same time too.

210
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,211
You can see the sipes real clear.

211
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:54,022
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

212
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,854
I know this truck.

213
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,489
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

214
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,398
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

215
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,336
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

216
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:11,171
- I kindly doubt it.
- O.K. Corral is just yonder.

217
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,008
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

218
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,281
This is just
a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

219
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,618
Yup. Appears to have been
a glitch or two.

220
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:33,186
- What calibers you got there, sheriff?
- Nine-millimeter.

221
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,392
Couple of.45 ACPs.

222
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:40,198
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

223
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,040
How come the coyotes
ain't been at them?

224
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,202
I don't know.

225
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,951
Supposedly, a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

226
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,487
These boys appear to be managerial.

227
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,851
I think we're looking at more
than one fracas. Execution here.

228
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,326
Wild West over there.

229
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:09,733
- It's that Mexican brown dope.
- Oh, these boys is all swole up.

230
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,668
So this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

231
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,602
Then, whoa, differences, and...

232
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,673
- Might not even a been no money.
- That's possible.

233
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:23,043
- But you don't believe it?
- No.

234
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,412
Probably I don't.

235
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,146
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, sheriff?

236
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,925
If it ain't,
it'll do till the mess gets here.

237
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,798
Yes, sir?

238
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,936
- I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
- Did you go up to his trailer?

239
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,914
- Yes, I did.
- Well, I'd say he's at work.

240
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,951
- Do you want to leave a message?
- Where does he work?

241
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,078
I can't say.

242
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,982
Where does he work?

243
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:50,551
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

244
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,822
Where does he work?

245
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,930
Did you not hear me?

246
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,060
We can't give out no information.

247
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:25,356
- Why all the way to Del Rio?
- I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

248
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,366
- You can't afford one?
- I don't want to register it.

249
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,130
- Look, I'll call you in a couple days.
- Promise?

250
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,192
Yes, I do.

251
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:39,308
- I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.
- I got a good one. Oughta even out.

252
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,778
Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

253
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,747
- Mama's gonna raise hell.
- Mm-hm.

254
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,807
She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

255
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:50,684
- Well, you should be used to that.
- I'm used to lots of things.

256
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,724
- I work at Wal-Mart.
- Not anymore, Carla Jean.

257
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,691
You are retired.

258
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,660
- Llewelyn?
- Yes, ma'am?

259
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:04,394
- You are coming back, ain't you?
- I shall return.

260
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,438
Sheriff's department!

261
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,435
Look at that lock.

262
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,579
- We going in?
- Gun out and up.

263
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,191
- What about yours?
- I'm hiding behind you.

264
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,287
Sheriff's department!

265
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:01,252
- I believe they done lit a shuck.
- I believe you're right.

266
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,459
- That from the lock?
- Probably must be.

267
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,193
- So when was he here, sheriff?
- I don't know. Oh...

268
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,758
- Now that's aggravating.
- Sheriff?

269
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:17,741
- Still sweating.
- Oh, sheriff! We just missed him!

270
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:22,075
We gotta circulate this on radio.

271
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,374
All right.

272
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,507
What do we circulate?

273
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,484
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

274
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:39,788
- Oh, sheriff, that's aggravating.
- I'm ahead of you there.

275
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:45,634
Think this boy Moss has got any notion
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches

276
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,638
- that are hunting him?
- I don't know. He ought to.

277
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:56,773
He's seen the same things I've seen and
it certainly made an impression on me.

278
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,352
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

279
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,685
Someplace cheap.

280
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,287
- You tell me the option.
- Do what now?

281
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:15,992
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

282
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:20,565
I'm just one person,
so it don't matter the size of the bed.

283
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,680
This is Roberto's
Automotive. I'm not in right now.

284
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,476
Please leave a message.

285
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,334
- Hello?
- Is Llewelyn there?

286
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:37,841
Llewelyn? No, he ain't.

287
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,842
You expect him?

288
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,710
Now why would
I expect him? Who is this?

289
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:54,724
- May I help you?
- Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans?

290
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,157
Shoulder, size 11?

291
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,889
- I'll check.
- You all sell socks?

292
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,455
- Just white.
- Well, white's all I wear. Bathroom?

293
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,724
Don't stop.
Just ride me up past those rooms.

294
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:35,823
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

295
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,198
I wanna see if someone's here.

296
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,700
Keep going. Don't stop.

297
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,747
I don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here.

298
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,749
It's all right.

299
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:56,514
Why don't I just set you down
right here and we won't argue about it?

300
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,886
- Take me to another motel.
- Let's just call it square.

301
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,085
You're in the jackpot,
and I'm trying to get you out of it.

302
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,219
Take me to another motel.

303
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,711
Lab reports from Austin
on that boy by the highway.

304
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,975
- What was the bullet?
- Wasn't no bullet.

305
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,178
- Wasn't no bullet?
- Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

306
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:09,192
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

307
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,386
No, sir.

308
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:14,591
You said entry wound in the forehead,
no exit wound.

309
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,929
- Yes, sir.
- You telling me he shot this boy

310
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,333
and then went digging around
with a knife?

311
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,736
- Sir, I don't wanna picture that.
- I don't either.

312
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,139
Can I freshen that there for you,
sheriff?

313
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,145
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

314
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,943
Ranger and the DEA
are headed back out to the scene.

315
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,610
Gonna join 'em?

316
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,245
Any new bodies accumulate out there?

317
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,650
- No, sir.
- Well, then I guess I can skip it.

318
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,474
- Twelve-gauge. You need shells?
- Yeah, double-ought.

319
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:04,378
- Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.
- Y'all got camping supplies?

320
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:07,747
Tent poles. You already have the tent?

321
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,581
Well, something like that.

322
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,520
Give me the model number on the tent,
I can order poles.

323
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,990
- Never mind. I want a tent.
- What kind?

324
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,050
The kind with most poles.

325
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,109
- Could I get another room?
- You wanna change rooms?

326
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,848
No, ma'am, I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

327
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,413
- Another additional?
- Yes, ma'am.

328
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,857
And do you have a map of the rooms?

329
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,589
Well, yeah, we had a sorta one.

330
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,523
Oh, thank you.

331
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,894
How about 38?

332
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:06,636
Well, you can have the one right next to
yours if you want, 137. It ain't took.

333
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,771
- No, 38 will be fine.
- Well, that's got two double beds.

334
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,406
How'd you find that?

335
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,786
You shouldn't be doin' that.

336
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:41,381
Even a young man like you.

337
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:45,121
- Doin' what?
- Hitchhiking.

338
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,596
Dangerous.

339
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,147
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

340
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:17,751
Yes, sir, I know him every which way.

341
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,193
When did you last see him?

342
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,753
Uh...

343
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,994
...November 28th, last year.

344
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,333
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

345
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:33,235
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

346
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:38,805
I remember dates, names, numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

347
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,646
Got a loose cannon here.

348
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,155
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party is out his product.

349
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,090
- Yes, sir.
- This account will give up

350
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:53,459
$1,200 in any 24-hour period.
That's up from a thousand.

351
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:57,694
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

352
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:59,860
OK.

353
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:03,702
- Just how well do you know Chigurh?
- What do you wanna know?

354
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:07,675
I just wanna know your opinion of him,
in general.

355
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:13,205
- Just how dangerous is he?
- Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

356
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,478
He's bad enough you called me.

357
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:20,046
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer,
but so what?

358
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,920
There's plenty of them around.

359
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,688
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday,

360
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,356
and two others in that
colossal goat-fuck out in the desert.

361
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,366
- We can stop that.
- Seem pretty sure of yourself.

362
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:38,003
You've led something of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr. Wells?

363
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:43,341
In all honesty, I can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

364
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,449
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

365
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,512
Could you validate my parking ticket?

366
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:57,154
- An attempt at humor, I suppose?
- I'm sorry.

367
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:07,301
You know, I counted the floors
to this building from the street.

368
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,895
- And?
- There's one missing.

369
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,605
We'll look into it.

370
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,432
One room. One night.

371
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,129
- That'll be $26.
- Alrighty.

372
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,470
You on all night?

373
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:49,774
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

374
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:55,874
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

375
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,978
There's someone
who been looking for me. Not police.

376
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,785
You just call me
if anyone else checks in tonight.

377
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,053
And by anyone, I mean any swinging dick.

378
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,696
There just ain't no way.

379
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,936
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

380
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,842
I need you
to drive me on outta here.

381
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,198
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

382
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,986
Were you in a car accident?

383
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,296
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

384
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,127
Lemme see the money.

385
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,662
Were you in a car accident?

386
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,376
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

387
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:26,381
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

388
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,680
Give it here.

389
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:43,691
Gimme that beer too.

390
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,196
How much?

391
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:50,735
Brian, give him the beer.

392
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,980
Ah!

393
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,362
Médico...

394
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,633
...porfavor.

395
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,497
Wait up!

396
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,337
...and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me,

397
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,568
and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!

398
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:24,204
Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight,

399
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,114
though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight

400
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:31,619
instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.

401
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,053
Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.

402
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,489
It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.

403
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:40,187
But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...

404
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:41,718
Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.

405
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,978
Any word on those vehicles yet?

406
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:16,081
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

407
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,720
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

408
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:23,287
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

409
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,595
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

410
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:28,465
No. Lord, no.

411
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,596
There's this month's checks.

412
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,132
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

413
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,905
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

414
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,971
Going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

415
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,276
That's cordial of him.

416
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:44,879
Can I get you to call Loretta,

417
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:47,649
tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

418
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,715
- Yes, sheriff.
- I'll call her when I get there.

419
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,523
I'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, I might.

420
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,393
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

421
01:13:56,465 --> 01:14:00,196
Uh-huh. Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

422
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,297
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

423
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:11,002
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

424
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:14,105
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

425
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:17,016
Might come to three before it's over.

426
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:19,818
What the hell?

427
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:30,029
Sheriff?

428
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,625
You looked at your load lately?

429
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:38,731
- That is a damn outrage.
- One of those tie-downs worked loose.

430
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:44,109
- How many bodies did you leave with?
- I ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

431
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,545
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

432
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,981
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

433
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:51,747
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

434
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,720
You get your ass outta here.

435
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,124
Buenos días.

436
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:03,790
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself

437
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:06,460
when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

438
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:09,666
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

439
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,973
I know that.

440
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,469
I've seen him.

441
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:18,877
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

442
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,113
Huh.

443
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,947
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

444
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,112
Don't think that's how I'd describe him.

445
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,053
How would you describe him?

446
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:32,321
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

447
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:34,954
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

448
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,498
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

449
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:40,899
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

450
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:44,166
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

451
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,935
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

452
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,842
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

453
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:54,576
- Yeah, well, I been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

454
01:15:56,885 --> 01:16:00,184
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

455
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:03,019
- What did you do?
- Welder.

456
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,355
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

457
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,952
- If it can be welded, I can weld it.
- Cast iron?

458
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,827
- Yeah.
- I don't mean braze.

459
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,832
- I didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

460
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,367
What did I say?

461
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:19,636
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, I was 'Nam.

462
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,501
So was I.

463
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,911
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

464
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:32,715
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

465
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:36,488
It's too late. I spent it.

466
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:39,858
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey,

467
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,692
and the rest of it,
I just sorta blew it in.

468
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:47,034
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

469
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:55,141
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

470
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:06,854
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... about me.

471
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,583
He isn't.

472
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:12,286
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

473
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:15,853
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

474
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,967
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

475
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,475
Carson Wells.

476
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,533
Call me when you've had enough.

477
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:32,580
I can even let you keep
a little of the money.

478
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:36,049
If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

479
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:40,555
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

480
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:45,423
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

481
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,689
He's a peculiar man.

482
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:52,860
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs

483
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:56,597
or anything like that. Not like you.

484
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,872
Yeah. He's not even like me.

485
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:03,536
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

486
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,545
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

487
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:10,380
Don't know why I did.

488
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:13,387
I told you, I don't know where he is.

489
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,787
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

490
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,654
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

491
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:21,924
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

492
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:26,832
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

493
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:30,497
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

494
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:34,303
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

495
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:37,402
He won't neither. He never has.

496
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:41,547
He can take all comers.

497
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:46,747
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out east of Sanderson?

498
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:52,618
You know how he used to slaughter
beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul,

499
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,525
truss 'em and slit their throats?

500
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:57,759
Charlie's got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him

501
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,131
and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

502
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,731
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

503
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,399
You'll excuse the... Well...

504
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:09,035
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head,

505
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:12,137
but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

506
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:14,842
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

507
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:18,545
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

508
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,852
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer,

509
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,721
the issue is not certain.

510
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:37,064
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I can make him safe.

511
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:45,642
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

512
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:49,810
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain.

513
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:53,013
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

514
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:59,757
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- I don't know.

515
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,128
My mind wanders.

516
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,545
Hello, Carson.

517
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:34,446
Let's go to your room.

518
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:49,362
You don't have to do this.

519
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:53,464
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

520
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,277
- You could.
- Make it worth your while,

521
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:02,544
take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

522
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:04,949
And everybody just walks away.

523
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,381
An ATM.

524
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,488
I know where the satchel is.

525
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,827
If you knew, you would have it with you.

526
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:21,801
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

527
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:26,273
- I know something better.
- What's that?

528
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,831
Where it's going to be.

529
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:33,004
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me

530
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,572
and placed at my feet.

531
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,387
You don't know to a certainty.

532
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:44,414
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

533
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:47,188
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

534
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:52,893
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

535
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,872
You go to hell.

536
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,975
All right.
Let me ask you something.

537
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:11,548
If the rule you followed
brought you to this,

538
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,213
of what use was the rule?

539
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:23,696
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

540
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:27,232
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

541
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,463
I mean the nature of you.

542
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:39,611
You... You can have the money, Anton.

543
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:22,053
- Hello?
- Yes?

544
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,956
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

545
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,688
Not in the sense that you mean.

546
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:37,861
- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?

547
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:40,931
You know who it is.

548
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:44,172
- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.

549
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,577
I think you do.

550
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:48,377
Do you know where I'm going?

551
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,044
Why would I care where you're going?

552
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:53,781
I know where you are.

553
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,050
Yeah, where am I?

554
01:24:56,124 --> 01:25:00,390
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

555
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:03,389
Do you know where I'm going?

556
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:09,260
- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.

557
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:10,895
You know she won't be there.

558
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:13,440
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

559
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:15,669
So, what're you going up there for?

560
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:21,839
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

561
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,342
Nope.

562
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,686
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

563
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:33,252
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

564
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:37,992
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

565
01:25:40,101 --> 01:25:42,501
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

566
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:46,506
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

567
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:53,213
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

568
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,442
Decided to make you a project of mine.

569
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:58,179
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

570
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,050
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

571
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,889
None of the three had ID on 'em,

572
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:10,727
but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

573
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:15,667
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

574
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,606
Yes, sir.

575
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,268
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

576
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,971
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

577
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,805
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for,

578
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,408
it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

579
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:35,422
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

580
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:38,357
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

581
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:42,419
I can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

582
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:45,955
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

583
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,765
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard,

584
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,135
cash their Social Security checks.

585
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:56,337
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

586
01:26:57,512 --> 01:26:59,639
Maybe their television set was broke.

587
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:03,081
And this went on until, here, I quote,

588
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:07,053
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises

589
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:09,112
wearing only a dog collar."

590
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:13,850
You can't make up such
a thing as that. I dare you to try.

591
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:17,625
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

592
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:20,429
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

593
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:30,872
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

594
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:35,006
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

595
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,610
Tell me something.

596
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:42,679
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

597
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,984
I don't know. American citizens?

598
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,962
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

599
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,022
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

600
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,398
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

601
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:58,405
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

602
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,838
If I don't, they don't.

603
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:01,966
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

604
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:04,705
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

605
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,672
Well, I got an overcoat on.

606
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,884
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

607
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:13,011
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

608
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,816
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

609
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,358
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

610
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:21,020
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion,

611
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:24,690
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

612
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:30,337
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

613
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:33,966
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

614
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:46,420
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

615
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:49,047
- I need everything else.
- OK.

616
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:52,718
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

617
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:55,126
No, sir. It's unusual.

618
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:11,601
- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

619
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,204
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care,

620
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,580
and don't you hang up this phone.

621
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:19,814
Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.

622
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,853
- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.

623
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:26,087
- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?

624
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,891
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

625
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:33,263
- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?

626
01:29:33,968 --> 01:29:37,131
You're hurt, ain't you?

627
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:39,469
What makes you say that?

628
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,101
- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!

629
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:46,772
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

630
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:49,316
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

631
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,818
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

632
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:55,083
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money,

633
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:57,954
he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

634
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,687
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

635
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:04,220
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?

636
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:06,198
- She'll be all right.
- All right?

637
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:08,792
Be all right? I got the cancer!

638
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,838
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

639
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,938
Hmm.

640
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:46,896
Who are you?

641
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,110
- Me?
- Yes.

642
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,376
Nobody.

643
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,145
Accounting.

644
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:01,054
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

645
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,359
He feels...

646
01:31:05,426 --> 01:31:09,055
He felt that the more people looking...

647
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:14,067
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

648
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,534
I see.

649
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,066
Are you going to shoot me?

650
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,111
That depends.

651
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,077
Do you see me?

652
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:37,817
I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

653
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:42,192
- Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.
- It ain't three years we been married.

654
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:46,461
Three years ago I said
them very words, "no" and "good."

655
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:50,197
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

656
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:55,675
I got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

657
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:59,175
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

658
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:02,410
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

659
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:05,418
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

660
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,593
- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.

661
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:21,396
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

662
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:25,303
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

663
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:27,534
You need help with the bags, madam?

664
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:31,510
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

665
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:34,343
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

666
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:39,114
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

667
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:42,121
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

668
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,749
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

669
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,122
Oh...

670
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:47,956
Carla Jean, how are you?

671
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:52,022
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

672
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:54,590
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

673
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,762
Um...

674
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:59,397
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail,

675
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:03,000
- but it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.

676
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:06,911
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

677
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:08,915
Yes, ma'am.

678
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:13,613
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you

679
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,851
who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

680
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:20,860
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.

681
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,795
He never thinks he needs any.

682
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:27,766
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

683
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:31,271
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

684
01:33:40,214 --> 01:33:42,307
What's the problem there, neighbor?

685
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:46,752
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

686
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:52,322
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

687
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:56,454
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

688
01:33:56,530 --> 01:34:00,728
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

689
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:04,567
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

690
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,099
Just lightin' out for the territories,
huh? Brother, I been there.

691
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:12,875
Well, there's airstrips.

692
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:15,279
The airport is El Paso.

693
01:34:15,349 --> 01:34:17,146
If you want someplace specific,

694
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:21,177
you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

695
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,450
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

696
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:26,425
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

697
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,361
What are you talking about?

698
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:49,272
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

699
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:53,309
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

700
01:34:53,387 --> 01:34:55,787
Yeah, that's me.

701
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:58,654
I got beers in my room.

702
01:34:58,726 --> 01:35:02,628
- Oh, uh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

703
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,530
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

704
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:08,227
- Well, half.
- What else then?

705
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:13,137
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

706
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:15,903
But no one ever sees that.

707
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:19,275
Beer! That's what's comin'.

708
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:22,144
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

709
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,707
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

710
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,681
Beer leads to more beer.

711
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,070
You all right?

712
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,208
Call the police.

713
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,314
Your local law enforcement.

714
01:36:33,654 --> 01:36:35,645
I'm not on their radio.

715
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:38,453
I met his daughter at the...

716
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:29,103
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

717
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:32,737
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

718
01:37:32,813 --> 01:37:35,145
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

719
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:37,776
I suppose so.

720
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,013
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

721
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:45,286
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

722
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,122
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

723
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:53,095
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

724
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:56,227
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago

725
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:59,431
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns

726
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:02,634
with green hair, bones in their noses,

727
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,270
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

728
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:06,904
Signs and wonders.

729
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:11,543
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

730
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:13,348
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

731
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:17,254
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

732
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:18,916
Not the one thing.

733
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:21,860
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

734
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:25,057
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

735
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:28,499
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

736
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:31,936
Well, sometimes
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

737
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,940
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

738
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:37,774
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

739
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:40,405
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

740
01:38:40,481 --> 01:38:43,382
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

741
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,416
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

742
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:50,981
walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

743
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:52,548
It's hard to believe.

744
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:55,891
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

745
01:38:55,963 --> 01:39:01,333
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

746
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:04,394
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

747
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:06,871
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

748
01:42:38,986 --> 01:42:42,217
- In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

749
01:42:42,289 --> 01:42:45,383
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

750
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:47,017
- You heard it?
- How's that?

751
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:51,292
Did you hear my...?
You're having fun with me.

752
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:55,734
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

753
01:42:55,802 --> 01:43:00,603
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- I deduced it when you walked in.

754
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,835
How many of them things you got now?

755
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:05,435
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

756
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:08,811
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got."

757
01:43:08,882 --> 01:43:13,114
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

758
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:19,921
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

759
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:24,594
I got to say, you're looking older.

760
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:26,189
I am older.

761
01:43:27,334 --> 01:43:29,802
Got a letter from your wife.

762
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:34,307
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

763
01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:38,071
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

764
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:44,049
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

765
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:53,389
How fresh is that coffee?

766
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:59,194
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

767
01:44:01,134 --> 01:44:03,466
That man that shot you died in prison?

768
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:08,069
Angola. Yeah.

769
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:10,939
What'd you done he'd a been released?

770
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:13,912
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

771
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:15,608
Wouldn't be no point in it.

772
01:44:15,682 --> 01:44:18,947
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

773
01:44:19,019 --> 01:44:22,750
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back

774
01:44:22,823 --> 01:44:26,486
what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

775
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,529
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

776
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:34,727
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

777
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:41,564
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

778
01:44:41,642 --> 01:44:43,940
I don't know.

779
01:44:46,647 --> 01:44:48,308
I feel overmatched.

780
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:55,480
I always figured when I got older,

781
01:44:55,555 --> 01:45:00,458
God would... sort of
come into my life somehow.

782
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:04,521
And He didn't.

783
01:45:08,402 --> 01:45:10,029
And I don't blame Him.

784
01:45:12,406 --> 01:45:15,341
If I was Him, I'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

785
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:17,773
You don't know what He thinks.

786
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:35,723
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers,

787
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,424
put it in their museum.

788
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:42,127
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

789
01:45:43,203 --> 01:45:46,764
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

790
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:53,878
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

791
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:56,916
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

792
01:45:56,983 --> 01:46:00,612
Well, they was ahead of him.

793
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:03,417
Shot him in his doorway.

794
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:06,084
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

795
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:10,095
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

796
01:46:10,163 --> 01:46:14,600
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

797
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:19,866
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

798
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:22,571
Left out.

799
01:46:24,745 --> 01:46:28,237
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

800
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:31,443
Shot through the left lung.

801
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:36,046
And that was that... as they say.

802
01:46:39,326 --> 01:46:40,623
When'd he die?

803
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:45,262
Nineteen zero and, uh... nine?

804
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:49,166
No, I mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

805
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:52,933
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

806
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:58,034
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

807
01:47:00,981 --> 01:47:03,745
What you got ain't nothin' new.

808
01:47:04,885 --> 01:47:07,581
This country is hard on people.

809
01:47:11,324 --> 01:47:13,451
You can't stop what's coming.

810
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:17,321
It ain't all waitin' on you.

811
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:22,032
That's vanity.

812
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:25,329
I knew this wasn't done with.

813
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:30,068
I ain't got the money.

814
01:48:32,105 --> 01:48:36,337
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

815
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:42,806
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

816
01:48:43,817 --> 01:48:45,682
I wouldn't worry about it.

817
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:49,879
I need to sit down.

818
01:49:05,171 --> 01:49:07,264
You got no cause to hurt me.

819
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:11,174
No. But I gave my word.

820
01:49:12,612 --> 01:49:16,241
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

821
01:49:19,252 --> 01:49:22,016
That don't make sense.

822
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:25,319
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

823
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:28,884
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

824
01:49:28,962 --> 01:49:31,829
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

825
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:38,827
Not like that.

826
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:42,238
Not like you say.

827
01:49:48,315 --> 01:49:50,112
You don't have to do this.

828
01:49:50,183 --> 01:49:52,447
People always say the same thing.

829
01:49:54,187 --> 01:49:55,449
What do they say?

830
01:49:56,556 --> 01:49:58,786
They say, "You don't have to do this."

831
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:05,023
- You don't.
- OK.

832
01:50:10,136 --> 01:50:12,127
This is the best I can do.

833
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:14,228
Call it.

834
01:50:18,745 --> 01:50:22,340
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

835
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:27,379
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

836
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:31,788
- Call it.
- No.

837
01:50:31,858 --> 01:50:34,383
I ain't gonna call it.

838
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:39,163
Call it.

839
01:50:39,232 --> 01:50:42,292
The coin don't have no say.

840
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:44,234
It's just you.

841
01:50:46,773 --> 01:50:49,867
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

842
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:35,642
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

843
01:52:35,715 --> 01:52:38,115
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

844
01:52:38,184 --> 01:52:41,119
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

845
01:52:41,187 --> 01:52:43,485
All right.

846
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:47,390
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

847
01:52:48,661 --> 01:52:50,629
What'll you take for the shirt?

848
01:52:55,201 --> 01:52:58,170
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

849
01:53:05,178 --> 01:53:08,636
Look at that fucking bone.

850
01:53:08,715 --> 01:53:09,875
Tie this for me.

851
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:12,952
Just tie it, just tie it.

852
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:34,997
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

853
01:53:35,074 --> 01:53:37,565
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

854
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:40,772
Take it and... you didn't see me.

855
01:53:40,847 --> 01:53:43,111
I was already gone.

856
01:53:43,183 --> 01:53:44,480
Yes, sir.

857
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:52,415
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

858
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:56,895
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

859
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:19,644
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

860
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:23,587
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

861
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:28,385
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

862
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:34,833
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... better not.

863
01:54:39,138 --> 01:54:42,471
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

864
01:54:42,542 --> 01:54:46,911
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

865
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:49,813
They always is to the party concerned.

866
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:54,645
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

867
01:54:57,090 --> 01:55:02,187
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

868
01:55:02,262 --> 01:55:05,254
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

869
01:55:05,331 --> 01:55:09,199
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

870
01:55:09,269 --> 01:55:12,363
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,

871
01:55:12,438 --> 01:55:15,168
but it was about meeting him in town,

872
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:17,835
somewheres,
and he give me some money.

873
01:55:17,911 --> 01:55:19,538
I think I lost it.

874
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:26,250
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

875
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:30,415
And I was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

876
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:33,926
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

877
01:55:33,993 --> 01:55:37,394
It was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

878
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:39,931
And he rode past me and kept on going,

879
01:55:39,999 --> 01:55:42,763
never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

880
01:55:44,404 --> 01:55:48,204
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

881
01:55:50,009 --> 01:55:54,002
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn,

882
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,980
the way people used to do, and I...

883
01:55:56,049 --> 01:55:58,643
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

884
01:55:58,718 --> 01:56:00,447
'bout the color of the moon.

885
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,287
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

886
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:06,955
...going on ahead.

887
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:12,429
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

888
01:56:16,035 --> 01:56:19,027
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

889
01:56:23,576 --> 01:56:25,544
And then I woke up.
