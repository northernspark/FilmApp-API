00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,841
Who do we?

3
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,323
Well, Bobby Fricker.

4
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:17,786
Disgusting. He always digs nose.
I eat saliva.

5
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,956
So what. Slabiæ said.

6
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,666
Come on, we can do it.

7
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,877
Come on Chrissy, just hang.

8
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:29,423

00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:04,434
Hello, I am Sam, and I'm not there.
Deliberately avoiding calls.

10
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,562
Leave a message after the signal.

11
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,940
Hello, I was not sure
Is this your number until I

12
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,234
heard the message,
but now I am sure.

13
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,571
I'm Chrissy,
and many expect.

14
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,367
I'm expecting a child, and me to
show up like you promised.

15
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,663
Maybe I am old,
but I'm older.

16
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,792
So, do we'll report if,
but when you gonna come.

17
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,795
After all,
promise is a promise...

Thomas Wolf once said:
"You can not go back home."

20
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,102
Now that's great for old Tom.

21
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,480
But he was not a girl who has entered into
a pact with her friends when he was

22
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,525
12 years, it will be back whenever
one of them needs help.

23
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,571
And here I am, right back to your home
childhood in Indiana.

24
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,158
Place for which I am sure that
I never wanted to see.

25
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,997
But the promise is a promise...

26
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,212
I seem to have chosen the wrong
week to quit smoking.

27
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,016
Hey doctor?
Can be a bit of basketball?

28
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,101
Not today. I am very busy.

29
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,395
It is for me.

30
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,807
Morning. Chrissy.
Is anyone there?

31
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,184
Come.

32
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,868
Hey, I saw corn
flakes, and she remembered you.

33
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,911
Do not go to shop,
and accident smršaš.

34
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:32,124
Very funny. But if this baby
does not trickle out soon, has to be of self.

35
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,002
- It would be convenient.
- Where are the others?
- He will come.

36
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,256
Do you see this slut?

37
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,509
What she has,
why should people crazy?

38
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,804
Long legs, narrow waist
and bomb boobs.

39
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,308
- Honey, you know how I feel about swearing.
- Chrissy, sucking is not blasphemy.

40
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,393
- I can not hear you. - Sis. - I can not hear.
- Sis. - I can not hear. - Sis!

41
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,680
SCENARIO

42
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,561
Hey, good to see you.

43
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,147
- You look great.
- How are you?

44
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,565
Image!

45
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,028
And you... see the...

46
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,159
Thank you for coming.

47
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,547
Hey bitches!

48
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,423
God have mercy.

49
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,552
- How is a star? It's nice to see you.
- Oh my God.

50
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,845
Image!

51
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,308
- See the stomach.
- Tina Tursall.

52
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,943
Images. Oh great look.

53
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,698
Nice to see you, Teeny.

54
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,284
Too much time has passed.

55
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,828
Enter. Enter.

56
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,628
Wow. Strong crate.

57
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,548
Just in the style of your mother.

58
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,676
You know what they say:
"What a mother, such Daughter."

59
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,849
Would you like you two
something to drink?

60
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,809
Can Jack Daniels.

61
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,937
We do not keep the violence at home.

62
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,732
Then whatever you have.
Anything is fine.

63
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,110
- We have a beer.
- Great.

64
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,321
Well.

65
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,947
'll Be right back.

66
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,247
I was just looking for this one.

67
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,347
I can not believe
you saved this.

68
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,099
- Morton wanted to tear down and burn.
- I hear my dear.

69
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,852
But I could not
to separate.

70
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,231
After all, is not mine to collapse.
Belongs to us all.

71
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,280
I really want you
thank you for coming.

72
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,494
Hey, do not worry about Chrissy. I think
you'd be a great mom.

73
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,748
Little prebrižna and rigid, but with
God's help, will bebac
izaæi relatively nepovreðen.

74
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,168
And if not, we can always
seek psychiatric help.

75
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,004
I can not believe that
are you going to give birth Chrissy.

76
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,257
It makes me very old.

77
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:11,718
Everything around me baby
thrown into a depression.

78
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,264
I mean, it born again, odgajiš,
recite him not to fuck,

79
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,808
and what you discard,
and blame yourself for rejection.

80
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,101
Iunatic.

81
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,312
Then it has a child, which
vicious circle just continues.

82
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,857
Thanks, sinister
kragujevaèki undertaker.

83
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,568
Well Sam, You're welcome
currently doing?

84
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,403
Drop this.

85
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,990
If you ask me to write
a book about doing something with as soon as
people can relate to.

86
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,744
I do not understand how you went with
those "aliens from the neighborhood."

87
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,539
To accept it as a compliment?

88
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,043
Why do not you write romance?
As it... Danielle Steel.

89
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,630
Well, this is a woman who knows how to
and making him okreæeš page...

90
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,051
This is true, Robert.

91
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,804
Making them no longer,
All the èudnije.

92
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,808
You know what, I would just like
you Vidam little more often.

93
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,645
How did it go?
Ten years since you went away.

94
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,397
We do not stop the passion.

95
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,986
Robert, for example, chose
to be an "alternative".

96
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,448
Living in sin with my boyfriend,
but it is still normal.

97
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,532
Yes, I am normal.

98
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,368
She had four wedding,
no endless series

99
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,287
monogamous relationship.

100
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,499
Do not wear black.
Not successful.

101
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,128
Technically, I was just married
three times, first was a duck.

102
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,963
See?

103
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,592
You always all funny.

104
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,470
If you ask me,
should grow up.

105
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,183
Maybe you're right.

106
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,323
Shelby, Indiana, there was not
the most exciting place to grow up.

107
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,827
In fact, most deaths
puberty, she died of boredom.

108
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:06,583
In those days before MTV and Nintendo,
we had to find a way for entertainment.

109
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,803
It began in the summer of 1970 and
every second summer.

110
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,265
The school is closed, and before us
There were three months of freedom.

111
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,019
But that year, freedom was not
enough. We wanted independence,

112
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,522
in a place called "home."

113
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,149
So we opted to buy
dog kennels in a tree.

114
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,360
Come up to steam,
Summer was our goal.

115
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,741
Four of us have lived in the Gaslight
Addition-in, the end of your dreams.

116
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:44,121
The all-new community built
on another, just shut down.

117
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,300
I already told you, I do not want
on how to talk.

118
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,054
Calm down Tom.

119
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,767
I can not anymore. How many times
We have had such conversations.

120
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:12,024
Everyone has problems.
Pokušaæemo to solve.

121
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,234
We tried, but no use.

122
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,112
Perhaps if more
his time home...

123
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,876
Come on.

124
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,102
My parents They argued
from when I remember.

125
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,689
It never bothered me.
On the contrary, actually.

126
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,151
It is that
comfort and safety.

127
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,968
Whatever I did,
they are all the greater.

128
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,613
Hurry up!
Breakfast getting cold!

129
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,411
Robert grew up with his father,
and three brothers.

130
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,663
Her mom died when
she was four years ago.

131
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,373
That's her picture on the mirror.

132
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:54,168
Robert, never left
house without the pictures.

133
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,847
Tina,

134
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,767
Tell us how you felt at the moment
when you realize that you won?

135
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,232
Well Ron, I can only say,
I thought about this day...

136
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,946
... I thought about this day...

137
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,823
... Dreamed about this day...

138
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,326
... From when I remember.

139
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,455
Win the "Oscar" in those years
outstanding success.

140
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,291
What do you plan next?

141
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,461
Teeny was the unit.

142
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,006
Her parents were èlanov
"Country Club". Never there.

143
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,967
Typical environment for future
actors and pathological liars.

144
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,678
Thanks director...

145
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,432
93, 94, 95 ..

146
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,822
Chrissy? Oh, sorry honey.
Can I get inside?

147
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,865
Of course.

148
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,994
Oh baby, holding it closed.
Collects the dust.

149
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,665
O-oh, can not gore.Mora down.
Is not that correct?

150
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,127
Chrissy You know what?

151
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,422
I was thinking...
about your question.

152
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,717
What about sex?

153
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,511
Yes, baby.

154
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:31,181
Are you saying it as "the way"
that the mother was afraid.

155
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,101
Like when somebody says "Boo!"
"Argh". That it is sex.

156
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,310
Sorry mom.

157
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,688
It does not matter. It's okay.

158
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,817
I think you're still too young
for this, but since these friends

159
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,694
bitches, you better know.

160
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,240
This may shock you...

161
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,954
This is a flower, right?

162
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,374
Well... all women have a garden...

163
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,170
a garden is a great need
hose to the Gulf.

164
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,923
Or you could do little as long as
effective.

165
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,135
As a direct
result of this conversation

166
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,221
Chrissy has spent a significant part of
life searching for the gardener.

167
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,272
These are Wormersi (worms).

168
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:23,025
The neighbors all had
sorry for their mothers.

169
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,819
Like us, they are
had a summer goal:

170
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,614
that we burnt life.

171
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,741
They were enemies.

172
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,701
Hey wormy Wormersi!

173
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,203
Now!

174
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,086
It is they want.

175
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:44,922
Down with Chrissy!

176
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,674
Run! Run! Run!

177
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,052
Just to reach you!

178
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,973
Robert, are you okay?

179
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,477
Shall we have worms!
And we always right back debts!

180
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,647
We are just
posrali girl from the crowd!

181
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,607
I need!

182
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,576
Foreplay:

183
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:58,495
A - Dinner with sveæe,
and walk along the beach,

184
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:02,040
B - 'vatanje medveðoj the skin,
at the local hill,

185
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,585
C - watching an erotic film

186
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,004
or D - all of this,

187
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,172
B.

188
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,008
E - none of the above.

189
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,136
Robert, this is not possibile answer.

190
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,472
Then B. .. I guess.

191
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,932
Definitely A.

192
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,976
What a surprise.

193
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,188
I chose D - all of these.

194
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,440
What iznenaðenjeA to niespodzianka.

195
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,319
We have 107 dollars and 24 cents.

196
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,990
- As far as we are missing?
- $ 23 and our dog kennels.

197
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,536
I suggest that when we buy,
Now make a party in pajamas.

198
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:41,538
I, see your mom.

199
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,506
- How short shorts.
- How mighty èizmice.

200
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,220
I do not know why, but earlier

201
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,223
This summer, my mom is begun
that dresses like Nancy Sinatra.

202
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,064
Your mom is so cool!

203
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:11,068
Hey, tonight is full moon.
Festival spirits.

204
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,237
They return to Earth
and walk among the living.

205
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,784
Four "of cows". It is
dollar and sixty, boys.

206
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,745
We are girls.

207
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,707
I know.

208
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,921
How horrible.

209
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,590
What you expect?
She's a witch.

210
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,803
I swear. There are voodoo dolls.

211
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,638
I saw it.

212
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:43,308
And you know, one of the dolls
looks the same as the director of Winters.

213
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,146
And it was a needle
stabbed through the heart.

214
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,150
I saw it in the morning
when it is strefio infarction.

215
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:05,372
Well, shall we try to
another session tonight?

216
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,250
Has not worked through,
and will not even this time.

217
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,793
Upaliæe.

218
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,171
It is the only night, when it breaks
barriers between the living and the dead.

219
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:15,257
I've read it in the encyclopedia
"Supernatural phenomena".

220
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,634
You're so screwed.

221
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,095
- I'm with you.
- Yes, me too.

222
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,723
Èitaj results.

223
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,184
Robert, you're a woman on the edge.

224
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:28,437
"Although your sensuality yet
to thrive, it's like
volcano ready to erupt. "

225
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,773
Wow, beware of the Robert.

226
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,150
It sucks.

227
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:37,154
Samantha: "You are walking a thin line
between romance and sex.

228
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,866
Do not be afraid to take initiative.
Maybe itself iznenadiš. "

229
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,534
Zapamtiæu it.

230
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,744
Chrissy:

231
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:46,622
"Bypass obstacles, rather than the
osušiš Šerifoviæ like Mary. "

232
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,917
What does that mean?

233
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,796
And now I am.

234
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,926
"Teeney, you're a sex magnet
attracted men from around the world.

235
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,428
Take care of it. "

236
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,442
I'll take the rest of my stuff
when a girl will not be there.

237
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,946
Do not leave me, please.

238
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,823
Becky, please do not ponižavaj
be. Just does not work.

239
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:19,089
I decided not to say
others for my father.

240
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,551
Tell me stupid, but I
really thought he would be back.

241
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,512
I wish that I did not
believed for years.

242
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,392
At that time, nobody in the neighborhood
are not divorced.

243
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:34,354
And I wanted to
different from mate.

244
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:49,495
It is so cold here.

245
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:53,123
Take my shirt. It's gonna be me
cold, but at least you'll æutati.

246
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,547
This looks fat.

247
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:05,260
- You are thick.
- I am not fat!

248
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,679
Am I fat?

249
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,015
Catch the person to hand himself.

250
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,020
Let us invoke
Marlin Monroe.

251
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,689
She did not want to cooperate
last time.

252
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,484
No one does not cooperate.

253
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,278
I think we need to bring up someone
buried in this cemetery.

254
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:27,741
How about
"Dear Johnnija?

255
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,081
To find out how he died.

256
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,542
Close your eyes.

257
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,628
Takes us on his way to another world.

258
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,924
Take care of our circle of safe,
and protects us from evil.

259
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,762
Dear Johnny, we know that
you were a child when you die.

260
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,099
I want to know how.

261
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,060
Ovdeee saaaam!

262
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,520
Concentrate.

263
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,693
Dear Johnny, can you hear me?

264
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,905
If you hear me, give us a sign.
Let us know.

265
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,367
OK, we just want
to talk to you.

266
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,871
Tell us how you died.

267
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:16,540
He is there.

268
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,425
Wants us to tell you a prièicu.

269
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:29,803
Mo ¿that it should stop.

270
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,680
He is afraid.

271
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,765
Tell him not to be afraid.
Say that all is well.

272
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,395
He is utterly alone.
Lonely.

273
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,607
He needs a friend.

274
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,909
My you.

275
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,956
It hurts.

276
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,875
You've earned it prdaro.

277
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,085
Never do not do that.

278
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,295
Sorry girls.

279
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:05,631
But you are too emotional
starting to all this.

280
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:09,009
I mean, all this is "like", right?

281
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,265
Where you goin, Chrissy?

282
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:17,518
Stop it, before
get a heart attack.

283
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,897
Chrissy, wait a minute!

284
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,152
Come on Sam!

285
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,158
I! I, we have here!

286
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,370
There is someone.

287
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,830
- What?
- There there.

288
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,666
I do not see anyone.
Probably just the wind.

289
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,085
Come on... Let's go!

290
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:53,929
Robert, what you can not
acting like a girl?

291
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,808
Look what you did to me!

292
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,435
You know what I hate
to be dirty.

293
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:01,770
This is nothing.

294
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,525
It's crazy Pit.

295
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,826
Run away from here.

296
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,225
Base called Chrissy,
database called Chrissy,

297
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,186
Chrissy, do you hear me.

298
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:08,772
What is it?

299
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,608
We have a secret meeting.

300
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:14,403
Sad?

301
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,365
I remember when I saw someone
at the cemetery after the session?

302
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,617
I think we came into the room.

303
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,785
Who?

304
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,912
- "Dear John".
- Come on...

305
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,331
This is a very bad idea.

306
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,251
This is definitely
not a good idea.

307
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,254
Shut up, Chrissy, that
and now not be offset.

308
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:34,089
Too.

309
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,467
Sam, are you okay?

310
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,763
Oh God!

311
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,725
We made it! We really did it.

312
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,394
Returned.

313
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:50,189
We summon him.

314
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,575
Nothing about "dear Johnni.

315
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:04,036
Until 1948 the
burned in the fire.

316
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:08,624
But Miss. Wendy says
copies of newspapers saved in
Greenfieldu library.

317
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,043
And that's it.

318
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:12,628
What is it?

319
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,255
We can not ride bikes
to Grienfielda.

320
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:19,551
Can we?

321
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,569
- True, or the challenge of Robert?
- True.

322
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,029
How big are you now sike?

323
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:22,948
Drop dead!

324
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:26,493
Has to say,
Do not I?

325
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,495
Not necessarily, if you do not want.

326
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,623
- And can we see them?
- No, you can not see them.

327
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,375
Freak.

328
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,502
I have not received them.

329
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,964
You'll get them... and mrzeæeš them.

330
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,382
No.

331
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:42,384
Robert're happy.
Men like you are great.

332
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,596
See what are my present.

333
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,931
Æoveèe, look like.

334
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,975
Filled with the pudding.

335
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,643
Pudding?

336
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,771
"Crviæi" gave me the idea.

337
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,357
They want the fever.

338
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:00,444
When the pudding is
relistiènija texture.

339
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,571
That it is the aroma?

340
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,491
Vanilla.

341
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,828
Chrissy, truth or challenge?

342
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,246
True.

343
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:13,582
Have you ever
tongue kissing?

344
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,793
Are you kidding? I do not want to get pregnant.

345
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:19,171
You can not get pregnant by kissing.

346
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:22,132
I know, mind.

347
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,302
But it is clear that if
kiss with a boy so

348
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,471
It automatically understand that you'll
and what to do with it.

349
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:30,599
I can not refrain. Such as.
It was their curse.

350
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,393
And what is the "what"
as you mentioned?

351
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,480
You know already...

352
00:31:36,939 --> 00:31:39,733
leaving him to
I watered a flower.

353
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:45,781
Do not go for that.

354
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,826
Man took his pipe,
and sprayed you cvetiæ.

355
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,119
I think the
Time to pause.

356
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,288
But we moved away quite far.

357
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:37,374
- Come on Chrissy.
- Dobro.Samo go, and leave me.

358
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,710
I do not care, I can rest.

359
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,006
Listen... Shut it.

360
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,342
It's beautiful.

361
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,892
Where did she go?

362
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,643
Where to go?

363
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:05,861
What is it?

364
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,657
The hair you.

365
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,659
Remove it to me!

366
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,413
Remove m it, please.

367
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,458
I can not.

368
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,710
- Totally hit it soft.
- Come on...

369
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,548
Calm down, Chrissy.

370
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,561
Stop it!

371
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:55,077
Beware! Go bomb!

372
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:57,830
It's too
shallow for that!

373
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:00,207
Go bomb!

374
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,634
Where was gone?

375
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,051
Come on... take out the!

376
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,765
- Do not breathe.
- Someone has to mouth-to-mouth.

377
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,684
You work the mouth to mouth,
I'm going to masiram heart.

378
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,769
- We will reverse.
- Get out of the 'times.

379
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,196
Well,

380
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,781
nice to know who they are
your true friends.

381
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:17,701
You know, I wanted to do it.

382
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,870
- And I wanted to.
- Yeah, right...

383
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:22,748
Chrissy is the only
that is really...

384
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:28,587
Never again to me this
you did! Never!

385
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:31,006
It was a joke.

386
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,848
It was not the first time that
Robert isfolirala death.

387
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:45,145
Earlier that year we were scared
when he jumped from the roof and
rules to be broken neck.

388
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:49,149
None of us has not experienced a loss
as it is, so we did not understand her jokes.

389
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:51,902
But she is still trying
that death made the ridiculous.

390
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,530
Perhaps to facilitate it?

391
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,200
What was that?

392
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:05,207
Listen,

393
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,626
I'm sorry.

394
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,921
If you mean, I appreciate what you wanted
that we are doing mouth-to-mouth.

395
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,300
To death frightened me.

396
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:18,053
Sorry.

397
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,975
Robert, you are my
best friend.

398
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,398
You have fucked right.

399
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,777
Robert, do not curse.

400
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,740
Hey, come here!

401
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:55,048
- Oh my God.
- What is it?

402
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,342
- I saw his penis.
- Whose?

403
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,428
- And eggs.
- Whose?

404
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,305
Scot.

405
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:11,231
Oh my God...

406
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:16,403
Great. Now I am not only
see Scotovu stvarèicu.

407
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,114
I'll be subject to gossip
end of summer...

408
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,450
Guys are making me look.

409
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,619
Chrissy, no and no to what does not...

410
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:24,995
Well, pogledaæu.

411
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:28,040
But I want to be perfect
clear that gledm in protest.

412
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:30,334
Yes. Right.

413
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:45,015
Not something big.

414
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,561
What's so funny?

415
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,856
Large only...
when the dude lifted.

416
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:57,986
And when that happens,
be this big.

417
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,989
What does "raise"?

418
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:03,450
Did not Mother nothing story?

419
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,703
Starting to think that
wrongly informed.

420
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,539
Hey, girls...

421
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:11,875
Let's do it!

00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,424
Yes, you better get started right away.

424
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:20,926
Back off, pervert!

425
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,846
Let's be serious. Let's go.

426
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:27,683
This is too easy.

427
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:31,687
Crviæi Hey!

428
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,398
Time for revenge!

00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:36,692
Reach us now donkeys!

00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:38,819

Quick!

433
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,192
Well, the game is over!

434
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,112
Come on, come on it.

435
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,701

00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,282
LIBRARIES IN GREENFIELD

441
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,575
Come on Chrissy.

442
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,953
Wait a minute.

443
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,384
I think I
alergièna dust.

444
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,305
Nothing happened in April.

445
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:32,516
Never arose not
happened in Shelby.

446
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,309
Me up so much.

447
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,104
Nothing.

448
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:56,665
KILLED TOWN teacher.

449
00:40:58,542 --> 00:40:59,751
What is it?

450
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,130
This is my Mom.

451
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,224
"There was a crash... lanean

452
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:17,311
Truck driver was
asleep at the wheel.

453
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,440
It's been an hour and a half while
Rescuers did not reach her car.

454
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:25,861
She was fully conscious while the
trying to get out
the destroyed car.

455
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,408
She died the same night of bruising,

456
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:34,661
and massive internal bleeding. "

457
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,541
I do not understand this.
It is not fair.

458
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,376
What does that mean?

459
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:44,963
Much namuèila.

460
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,174
A lot of pain.

461
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,764
She was very pretty, is not it?

462
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,726
As a movie star.

463
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,374
Girls, I think
I found something.

464
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,209
Read.

465
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:08,297
"Saturday will be held on
funeral of 12-year-old Jonathan,

466
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:11,341

Beverly Simms.

467
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,803
Because tragiènog sequence of circumstances,
which include the death,

468
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,099
the family has requested that
funeral to be private. "

469
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:27,483
That is all. There is nothing else.

470
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:30,110
What do you mean "it's all"?

471
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,029
How they died?

472
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:36,200
Just a little.

473
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:40,662
Torn the pages.

474
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,918
Someone has just tried,

475
00:43:45,918 --> 00:43:48,504
Johnnijeva to death a secret.

476
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:02,684
Hi.

477
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:04,728
Hi.

478
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,981
Are you in the army?

479
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:11,777
Was.

480
00:44:11,777 --> 00:44:13,320
Vietnam?

481
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:17,574
Was.

482
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:19,910
You killed someone there?

483
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:26,083
Not because I wanted.

484
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,877
Are you wounded?

485
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:33,757
It's a great song.

486
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:36,093
The foot and still in pain?

487
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:40,389
Yes. Pain as the devil.

488
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,893
But this wound is the best
what ever happened to me.

489
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:46,854
How so?

490
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:51,233
She packed me
the first plane home.

491
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:54,069
But we are the winner, right?

492
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,572
Nobody wins.

493
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,410
You want some?

494
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:15,257
Thanks.

495
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,217
Cigarette?

496
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:19,720
I want one.

497
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,767
Smoking slows growth.

498
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:32,941
Slight...

499
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:43,494
Well, have received a "purple heart"?

500
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,162
Yes.

501
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,414
Why do not you?

502
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,333
Yes. It is a great honor, right?

503
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:53,170
It is not.

504
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:58,759
On the news say that the U.S.
there almost settle things.

505
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:01,678
Forget it, okay?

506
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,473
Do you have what you heard,

507
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,683
what you see,

508
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:09,978
even you have people who lie about
what they saw there...

509
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,397
... Or did.

510
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:15,234
It seems that no one
no longer be trusted?

511
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,654
You believe in yourself.

512
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:22,366
If you are lucky.

513
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:27,788
Well, ostaæeš here for a while?

514
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:30,457
No.

515
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:33,919
I try to nowhere
linger too long, you know?

516
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:35,587
Yes. Definitely.

517
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:40,425
Is that earrings on you?

518
00:46:41,426 --> 00:46:42,427
Yes.

519
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:45,639
You're a hippie, right?

520
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:48,517
On the track of me...

521
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:51,728
My Mom says that all
hippies sex fanatics.

522
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:58,026
I'll tell you something, I would like to
someone told me at that age?

523
00:46:58,527 --> 00:46:59,862
What is it?

524
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,322
Parents are not always right.

525
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:03,699
Do not shit...

526
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:09,246
It's late. I think
you should go.

527
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:11,456
- Bye.
- Bye.

528
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:15,752
I guess he was right.

529
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:20,841
Thanks.

530
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,135
Bye...

531
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,471
See ya.

532
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:28,849
Hello.

533
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:37,691
Whatever you seek,
I hope you'll find.

534
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,208
Peace.

535
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:14,353
Where is my Dad?

536
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:19,691
I told you already, he had to go
for a while. But soon you will
be able to see it...

537
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:22,027
Ate? Every other weekend,
and holidays?

538
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:24,905
But I want to see it now.

539
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:27,699
I would love to you heart
but you can not.

540
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,926
Hey Ande, I saw yesterday
crazy pie.

541
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:48,762
Children, leave the poor
man alone.

542
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:52,808
Why are you so dressed up at all?

543
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,226
How?

544
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:56,311
So. Was humiliating.

545
00:48:57,896 --> 00:48:59,648
Anybody home?

546
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:01,483
Do not answer!

547
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,486
It's just a grandmother.

548
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:05,988
What happens?

549
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:08,740
Baba you are upset because
Dad moved up.

550
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:12,035
So? Let yelling at him.
He is the one who is gone.

551
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:15,414
I know you're there!

552
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:18,333
I saw a car in the garage!

553
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:19,877
Open up the door!

554
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,759
Hide.

555
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,303
What?

556
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:31,889
Hide!

557
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:35,893
Open! I want to
I see a girl.

558
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,146
I can now see it.

559
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,983
Once you're gonna have to surrender!

560
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,235
- This is a nightmare.
- Why not let Baku.

561
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,321
Open the damn door!

562
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:53,118
It's here.

563
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:56,622
Suspicious lack of detail
Johnnijevu related death,

564
00:49:56,622 --> 00:49:59,333
led us to the only person
that could help us.

565
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:02,461
Mistika - Divination

566
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,555
Yes?

567
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,558
We need your help.

568
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,644
I was not really in the mood
Today, guys.

569
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,731
Come on... give her money.

570
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:28,111
Mo ¿and that this cheer.

571
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:33,200
Enter.

572
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:37,913
I can not believe that we are
give up dog kennels, because of this...

573
00:50:39,456 --> 00:50:40,666
What brings you here?

574
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:42,376
We have contacted the spirit.

575
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,419
- His name is Jonathan Simms.
- I know.

576
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:50,259
I feel a strong presence
ghosts here.

577
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:53,136
For ten dollars out of the kennel
wood, and I'd oseæala.

578
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:54,805
Silence.

579
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:15,617
Pentecost is here, and that
they want to with you a story.

580
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:29,882
Shuffle this twice, and sections
three times in front of me.

581
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,595
Relax mind and body,
and open up the spirits.

582
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:00,204
DEATH

583
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:02,706
We want to know
how he died.

584
00:52:15,677 --> 00:52:18,430
Did you see her facial expression?
She was scared.

585
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:21,183
Girls, it's fake.

586
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:23,602
She was scared - and so have you.

587
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:25,687
Well, what do we do now?

588
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:29,024
Ghosts haunted live with razlogom.Dragi
Johnny wants to know how he died.

589
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:33,237
You saw the map. He was killed.

590
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:35,906
You may want to take revenge.

591
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,700
Come on, this izmièe control.

592
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:41,286
You should talk to some
who was living when he died.

593
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:42,663
Who, for example?

594
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:45,833
With my grandmother. It is
the oldest person you know.

595
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:51,129
Today he plays poker, but said that
Tomorrow morning we can turn aside.

596
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,715
Your grandmother playing poker?

597
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:55,342
He likes to gamble.

598
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:59,555
Oh, but I promised his dad that I
help to dye ogradu.Mislim,
Come on girls... it is 10 dollars.

599
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:04,101
- Kenny, where the fire?
- In softball, the Candles field.

600
00:53:04,685 --> 00:53:07,396
- Oh, come on.
- But It'll only boys

601
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:08,939
And then I wait until what?

602
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:28,417
- Come on Berti, you can do it.
- I houmran is now inevitable...

603
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:30,627
Let's go to second base!
Let's go!

00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,713
Show them how to play Robert!

605
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,799
Well, pride!

606
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:48,812
This is for that of yesterday.

607
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:52,983
- Come on Robert, you can do it.
Gaðaj over their heads!
- Shut up!

608
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,247
Come on Robert... Tae Down!

609
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,670
Hello dear.

610
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:15,339
Go away, you nerd!

611
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:21,345
Well, come on Robert,
Home Rule ran, ran the Home Rule...

612
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:25,349
Who you kidding?

613
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,601
Girls can not
to play softball.

614
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:30,145
What did you say?

615
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:37,903
I said, girls can not
play softball.

616
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,031
What's he doing?

617
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:43,534
Robert, remember that you are a lady.

618
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:48,413
Why do not you go home,
want to play with dolls.

619
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:50,999
She has a doll and GI Joe.

620
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:54,878
TUÈAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!

621
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:18,527
Robert, see my hair.

622
00:55:18,694 --> 00:55:19,820
Crazy bitch...

623
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:23,240
- Fuck off!
- What is the feeling when the girl beats?

624
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:26,034
It's a shame that your mother is dead.

625
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:28,745
For someone so I have to learn to
acting like a girl.

626
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:32,457
TUÈAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!

627
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,727
Ah there you are. Samanha, I want to
meet my friend...

628
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,896
That's Mr.. Kent. A friend of mine.

629
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:55,689
Hey Samantha.

630
00:55:56,231 --> 00:56:01,487
Your mother talked about you all
much. Tells you you're a good kid.

631
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,447
I'm glad.

632
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:19,505
It gives me great pleasure,
young lady.

633
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:22,674
And it looks good...
just like your mother.

634
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:38,857
And Samantha, Your Mama
I said that you are interested in science.

635
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:40,484
Nauen size.

636
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:42,778
Have you ever been
in "Smithsonian" museum?

637
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:47,825
E to be seen, I tell you...

638
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:49,701
This place is huge.

639
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,412
And bigger than huge.

640
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:58,418
I do not know Mama, you should
planning a trip to DC before school?

641
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:00,671
What do you think?

642
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,800
It would be great! Do not
Samantha would be cool?

643
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:13,058
I think we could all
to have fun.

644
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,855
Dad would take us there.

645
00:57:22,985 --> 00:57:24,361
Well... hell...

646
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:28,991
Mr. Kent?

647
00:57:29,158 --> 00:57:30,534
Please, call me Bad.

648
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:32,619
Gad?

649
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:35,247
No. Bud.

650
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:37,791
B - U - D.

651
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:45,257
So Bad, I have a piece of food,
that you stuck to your teeth.

652
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,218
Damn!

653
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:52,431
It's okay. Just wait.
'll Be right back.

654
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:57,102
What are we...?
I think there more...?

655
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:58,979
No, not disappeared.

656
00:57:59,188 --> 00:58:00,647
Thanks.

657
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:03,609
Jitters of the first meeting.

658
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,360
This is a very pretty scarf.

659
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,280
Thanks Lydia.

660
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:15,370
Well I have isflekao tablecloth...

661
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,164
It's okay.

662
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:30,385
Samantha?

663
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:25,357
"Love is when you never...
you have to say sorry... "

664
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:33,240
What the movie?

665
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:35,492
Izvlaèi tears.

666
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:40,622
Where did you get so late?

667
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:43,375
I left a little to think.

668
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:46,211
In spavaæici?

669
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:52,926
Dog kennels to try the wood?

670
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:54,553
Of course.

671
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:08,609
You are not followed by the.

672
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,404
Who asked what?

673
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:50,484
're Pretty good.

674
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:53,362
Thanks.

675
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:56,323
I do not think you are good only
the girl, but also to boys.

676
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,792
Want soda, or something like that?

677
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:08,585
Super. Èekaæu.

678
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,387
- Robert?
- What is it?

679
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:22,766
Why the constant strife?

680
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,812
That anything done.

681
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:30,232
Because you know, I wondered...

682
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,735
because I think you're a great girl.

683
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:38,490
I've always
I thought that you hate me.

684
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:41,201
And I am.

685
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:56,008
- Robert?
- What?

686
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:04,183
- Mo... HGH... and p.. Love?
- What are mumlaš?

687
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,898
Would it be okay to...

688
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:15,736
Can I kiss you?

689
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:20,324
-... I guess...
- Super... ready?

690
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:22,117
Want it now?

691
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:23,327
Yes.

692
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:25,329
I mean, if you will.

693
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:27,039
Well.

694
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,008
Ah, it was great.

695
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:39,927
It's okay.

696
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:54,441
Scot, if equal mention this to someone,
and especially his brothers...

697
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:57,611
izbatinaæu the shit out of you.

698
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:01,740
Well.

699
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:05,869
Truth or challenge?

700
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:07,204
True.

701
01:03:07,663 --> 01:03:10,874
Do you find yourself on a desert island
with me, Chrissy and Robert,

702
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:17,256
and that there is nothing to eat,
which would be killed and eaten?

703
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:20,008
This is silly pitanje.Šanse
for they are almost none.

704
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:22,928
Regardless, you have to answer.

705
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,472
So I guess Chrissy.

706
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:27,516
Why?

707
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,144
Feed more people.

708
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:35,232
Truth or challenge?

709
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:37,067
True.

710
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,242
Do you love your parents?

711
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:49,037
I do not know your parents.

712
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,166
But as I'm concerned,

713
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:53,750
They are assholes.

714
01:03:56,962 --> 01:04:00,132
You know, I believe in what he
soldier said, they are not always right.

715
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:03,677
I mean, that as adults
does not mean absolutely nothing.

716
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,054
I never thought it means.

717
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:10,642
And I am...

718
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:16,815
Dad moved.

719
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:19,526
Divorce is.

720
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:22,988
But I thought that when you agree.

721
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:27,284
- I lied.
- Why?

722
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:28,452
I do not know.

723
01:04:29,495 --> 01:04:31,538
I just wanted
normal family, you know?

724
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:33,207
As Brady Bunch.

725
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:37,085
Well, six kids in one
the bathroom, I do not sound like fun.

726
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:39,755
After all, Mike and Carol
the ožalošæeni.

727
01:04:41,173 --> 01:04:42,716
Then Partridge Family.

728
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:46,386
Shirley Jones, the widow,
Buffy and Jody are siroèiæi.

729
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,849
Like the time Eddie's father - a widower.

730
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:52,810
"My three sons" - a widower.

731
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:54,770
"Bonanza" - a widower.

732
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:57,022
"Beverly Hillibillies" - widows.

733
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:58,482
You see Sam,

734
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:01,276
no perfect families.

735
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:03,695
It is normal that things
be shitty.

736
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:08,075
Maybe this is normal,

737
01:05:09,785 --> 01:05:11,203
but it still hurts.

738
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,969
All of them have died Teeney.

739
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:30,347
But my Dad has decided to leave.

740
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:42,568
I really miss.

741
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:01,044
It's okay.

742
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:08,760
I'll always be there for you.

743
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:10,220
Thanks.

744
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:20,439
What are you doing? Adore it...

745
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:38,957
When I was 12 years old, and no
efforts live for the moment,

746
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,294
do not complain about the past,
and do not worry for the future,

747
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:49,176
but at that moment in the kennel
wood, we met Teeney
heart, sigurnošæu and comfort.

748
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:51,386
Best friends for life.

749
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:53,764
For life.

750
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:58,018
- Better get going.
- Yes.

751
01:07:00,229 --> 01:07:03,148
You know, I heard that will in ten
age, gender rhizobia be divorced.

752
01:07:03,816 --> 01:07:05,818
Well, in that we already
hard to believe.

753
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,822
Come on! Run away from here.

754
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:18,914
- Teeney?
- What is it?

755
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:20,374
She disappeared!

756
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:22,709
- What do you want?
- Rosary! Just came off!

757
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,799
We'll be back in the morning. Rain is...

758
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:31,885
We have to find now.

759
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:46,525
There she is!

760
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:50,028
- You see.
- I do not see it.

761
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:51,488
Inside is, you see.

762
01:07:51,488 --> 01:07:52,698
Dohvatiæu is me.

763
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:57,870
Damn!

764
01:07:57,953 --> 01:07:59,746
It's okay. Dohvatiæu said.

765
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:01,999
- Be careful.
- Well, I will. Hold this.

766
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,209
Oh, God.

767
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,630
Can you? Only carefully.

768
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:17,973
Here is svaèega...

769
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:21,018
See, jojo.

770
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,396
Hurry, please.
Really starts to treatment.

771
01:08:26,773 --> 01:08:28,942
- I got it.
- Super. Come on now, hurry.

772
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:54,218
Teeny, give me your hand!

773
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:03,060
Hold!

774
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,274
Help me!

775
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:20,244
Let us some help!

776
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:24,081
I'm coming!

777
01:10:14,298 --> 01:10:15,424
Are you okay?

778
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:32,983
Why do you fear me?

779
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:38,363
It's weird to hear that you
out only at night.

780
01:10:39,948 --> 01:10:41,992
It's kinda... creepy, you know?

781
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:47,956
Yeah, well... I do not like
lucky a lot of people.

782
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:51,460
And I think that they do not want
much happiness to me.

783
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:58,217
Take her home.

784
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:03,055
We'll see the Pit.

785
01:11:09,353 --> 01:11:11,313
And that was not there, Sam?

786
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,194
Teeney and I know what
whether it was not there.

787
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:22,241
And since that night, we had
hero in a crazy Pitta.

788
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:43,804
Robert, you missed a bit.

789
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:46,723
And do not the ass of odlepiš
asphalt, and help us.

790
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:50,978
You know that if you do not eat every
few hours, I get dizzy.

791
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:58,777
Grubby alert!

792
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:01,238
And I thought that something stinks.

793
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:03,031
Perhaps your
smart, skinny.

794
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:04,783
Oh, your wit me stunned.

795
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:08,245
- I do not want to brag...
- Come on, man, we go from here.

796
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,626
Ladies...

797
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,715
What's his problem?

798
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:21,508
It may be disturbed...

799
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:24,636
And maybe not such a jerk?

800
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:40,194
That day, Robert had stopped
to prelepljuje sike.

801
01:12:58,295 --> 01:13:01,089
I did not know that oppose
my whole neighborhood.

802
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:02,299
Enter.

803
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:06,136
I have prepared many
fresh lemonade.

804
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:09,264
Sit down girls...

805
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:12,601
Samantha, how you hold?

806
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,770
I'm good grandma.

807
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,688
I'm glad, most
I care for you.

808
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:17,981
We'll be ok.

809
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:22,486
Well it was Mrs. Anderson.
We take care of it well.

810
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:24,112
I'm glad to hear that.

811
01:13:25,364 --> 01:13:27,241
Let's see now... because
have extra company.

812
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:30,869
L'll still EASA, and to hear

813
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:36,166
Sam, What so many concerns

814
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,001
Who knows?

815
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:42,005
Well... refreshing.

816
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:48,637
At one gulp.

817
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:52,516
What is it?

818
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:54,143
Shiny.

819
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:58,981

Jonathan and Beverly M. Simms.

823
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:08,448
Only we are interested

824
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,742
Is' them something

825
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:12,494
Yes.

826
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:16,957
But it is something that

827
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:19,084

828
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,546

He had a fascination and...

836
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,825
He was interested in every
event in the city.

837
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:56,288
Oh, God.

838
01:14:57,456 --> 01:14:59,166

851
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:59,226
One, Two, Three.

852
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,480
I know that Dedina
archive somewhere.

853
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:18,245
You found something?

854
01:16:18,412 --> 01:16:19,955
Not yet.

855
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:45,272
I, I think
I found something.

856
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:51,862
These are my parents.

857
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:54,990
Are a great couple.

858
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:56,533
Yes.

859
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:17,012
MURDER CITY amazed.

860
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:25,813
Jack-pot!

861
01:17:30,442 --> 01:17:32,069
Were killed.

862
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:36,657
"Beverly Simms and her 12-year-old
Jonnathan son was brutally murdered
petek late evening.

863
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:39,952
Body was discovered by Peter Simms.

864
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:43,872
After leaving the pub at midnight,
found their bodies riddled.

865
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,087
Sheriff believes that the robbers
escaped, and both victims

866
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,548
killed in his sleep.

867
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:56,009
There is no evidence, no suspects.

868
01:17:56,093 --> 01:17:59,721
Sheriff believes that the robbers were
in passing, and left town. "

869
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:05,727
This is an introductory Article I
my grandfather's newspaper.

870
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:15,404
"Although nothing is as it seems,
something we understood from the killings,

871
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:20,033
and that is that if we thought that
Shelby being protected from violence from

872
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,327
outside world - we are deceived. "

873
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:24,788
Shelby is a safe city.

874
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:27,624
If something like this happened here,

875
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:30,627
imagine how is it there?

876
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:49,563
Robert, that's okay.

877
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:52,441
No, not right! Not OK!

878
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:57,905
Why did they have to die?
Why she had to die?

879
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:02,701
Dad lied.

880
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:06,830
He said that the beautiful angel
down to earth, and took it.

881
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:11,084
People should not feel cut pain.

882
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:21,094
Why did he have to die?

883
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:23,764
Why have I lied?

884
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:30,687
Only on my left,
and lying to me.

885
01:19:42,825 --> 01:19:45,160
You're not the only one he left.

886
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:59,508
I only you and
can count.

887
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,055
I know how you feel.

888
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,266
What do you mean?

889
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:14,439
My Dad moved.
Divorce is.

890
01:20:15,274 --> 01:20:16,608
Divorce...

891
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:18,318
I'm sorry.

892
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,822
Fuck them.

893
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:24,658
You have us.

894
01:20:26,577 --> 01:20:29,580
Let's make a deal. Here and now.

895
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:33,959
We are always there for each other.

896
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:36,670
No matter what happens in life.

897
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:39,965
If Teeny goes to Hollywood

898
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:42,551
or I marry
rich doctor...

899
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:45,596
setiæemo this day,
and this agreement.

900
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:50,309
Whenever you need a friend,
to be there for each other.

901
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,812
And on that count. Always.

902
01:20:55,522 --> 01:20:57,816
No matter what.

903
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:00,944
Then the deal.

904
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:04,656
All for one,
and one for all.

905
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:09,536
Now, more than ever we must
Johnni provide peace.

906
01:21:10,287 --> 01:21:11,622
Ready?

907
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:21,757
We returned from the dead Johnnija,
and for us to send him home.

908
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,802
Close your eyes.

909
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:34,394
Takes us on his way to another world.
Take care of our circle of safe,
and protects us from evil.

910
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:40,442
Dear Johnny, we know that you and
your mother was brutally murdered.

911
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:43,862
Have you returned to tell us
Who did it?

912
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:46,198
We're here to help you
to poèivaš in peace Johnny.

913
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:48,992
We listen to you.

914
01:21:50,035 --> 01:21:52,120
Here is...

915
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:55,040
Do not break them round.

916
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:58,126
Tell us who did it Johnny.
We're here to help you.

917
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,755
Holy God...

918
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:16,395
- It's a killer!
- Please do not hurt us!

919
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:22,192
Hey, this is not a polygon.
This is the cemetery.

920
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:27,573
And you kids should have
little respect for the dead.

921
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:30,617
Hey, we have a lot of
respect for the dead, okay?

922
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:32,452
Yes, this is why we are here.

923
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:34,580
We have risen from the grave Johnnija.

924
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,873
Really?

925
01:22:35,873 --> 01:22:38,167
And to think that his
monument broke in half?

926
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,962
I've broken down tractor.

927
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:46,049
Really?

928
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:47,217
Yes.

929
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:50,971
It is not easy to ask all
and monuments.

930
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:11,867
No longer work
this stupid session.

931
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,620
It is a waste of time.

932
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,080
I can not believe that we
thought that we managed...

933
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,501
And what about the tarot cards, in. ..

934
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:21,960
Forget it.

935
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:39,978
I knew that day that our
days fantasizing over.

936
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,566
As they get older, it becomes
increasingly difficult to blindly believe.

937
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:49,112
It's not that we want, but it is too
it happened that we could.

938
01:24:07,005 --> 01:24:08,298
Let's go.

939
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:12,136
You see, this is a Crazy Pete.

940
01:24:15,139 --> 01:24:16,932
Leave him alone, okay?

941
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:37,578
What is it?

942
01:24:38,036 --> 01:24:40,330
I forgot something in the cemetery.
Stiæiæu you.

943
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:42,332
You want to go with you?

944
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:44,168
No, I'll be good.

945
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,709
You are Peter Simms.

946
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:33,675
They were my closest.

947
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:38,555
It is terrible what happened to them...

948
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:41,725
I'm sorry.

949
01:25:43,185 --> 01:25:46,313
I have long thought that I
To prevent it could.

950
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:50,567
I was at home,
and not in that damn pub.

951
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:01,078
You were there for me.

952
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:08,669
I Proæerdao many years,

953
01:26:10,212 --> 01:26:12,798
afraid to face the people.

954
01:26:13,507 --> 01:26:15,509
Usually afraid to
confront with them.

955
01:26:28,856 --> 01:26:30,858
And then I'm afraid.

956
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:37,489
What's your name?

957
01:26:37,573 --> 01:26:39,158
Samantha.

958
01:26:42,035 --> 01:26:45,956
Well, in life you will happen
things that you can not spreèiti.

959
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:50,043
But that is no reason
discard the world.

960
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:54,047
There is a purpose and for good and for evil.

961
01:27:10,606 --> 01:27:12,649
He gave me the only
gift that he could.

962
01:27:12,858 --> 01:27:15,777
Lessons, which would be required
a lifetime to learn.

963
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,865
And no matter what I
realize the importance of his words,

964
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:22,993
only now when I look back,
understand their meaning.

965
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:27,831
Sleep in peace, dear Johnny.

966
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:18,715
We've tried grèevito
to fit in, look the same,

967
01:28:18,715 --> 01:28:21,593
to do the same thing... practically,
to be the same person.

968
01:28:23,637 --> 01:28:27,224
While we have not seen,
to be changed.

969
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:30,644
Dog kennels in the tree is supposed to
give us a bigger independence

970
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:33,856
but we were actually done this summer
independent from each other.

971
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:47,286
What is it?

972
01:28:47,703 --> 01:28:49,746
Your car blocking my jeep.

973
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:50,873
- Oh shit!
- I come...

974
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,126
- I think I saw the head.
- Who has seen my head?

975
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:56,545
- I have not seen my head?
- You did not see his head...

976
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:59,298
- I'll get the keys.
- Ma forget kljuèeve.Idemo limo!

977
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:04,303
Go for bags, and call Morton.

978
01:29:05,053 --> 01:29:06,889
No, do not leave me
here with her!

979
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:08,932
Well, we go to school before
ispljuneš something...

980
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:13,645
- How are you?
- Hello...

981
01:29:13,645 --> 01:29:14,688
Comes out, I need your car.

982
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:15,898
Huh?

983
01:29:15,898 --> 01:29:18,150
I've got a pregnant woman
must be in the maternity ward.

984
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:20,944
No problem. Just me
say where, and there are an instant.

985
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:22,779
Second is too long.

986
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:24,406
- Get the mamlaze!
- See?

987
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:28,202
Thanks.

988
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:31,914
Nice day.

989
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:34,124
Move!

990
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:42,007
- This is too much effort.
- Sorry.

991
01:29:43,425 --> 01:29:46,261
Morton is in the midst of work,
we find in the hospital.

992
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:47,471
There is a lot of mail.

993
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:52,017
Dare you to do this?

994
01:29:52,893 --> 01:29:56,146
Got a video recorder! I can not believe...
Robert! Here is a video recorder?

995
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:58,482
Right? And is there a remote?

996
01:30:01,068 --> 01:30:03,237
Well, a lot of screaming.
Thanks.

997
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:04,655
Breathe... breathe... breathe...

998
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,201
Chrissy, your uncle.
And no, not him.

999
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:11,537
Oh, shit!

1000
01:30:11,787 --> 01:30:13,539
Do not curse in front of my baby.

1001
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:15,999
Sraaanjeeee!

1002
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,669
Chrissy, you'll have to push!

1003
01:30:18,669 --> 01:30:20,087
Come on, just push!

1004
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,299
God, I changed my mind
I get the drugs!

1005
01:30:24,299 --> 01:30:25,342
Too late for that.

1006
01:30:25,342 --> 01:30:27,261
Give me the drug, or the unic!

1007
01:30:27,344 --> 01:30:28,428
Give her the drugs, give her...

1008
01:30:28,554 --> 01:30:29,763
And you'd better calm down, okay?

1009
01:30:30,180 --> 01:30:31,515
Chriss now push, push!

1010
01:30:35,102 --> 01:30:36,895
Come, see the head, see head.

1011
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:42,151
I really see little head.

1012
01:30:43,318 --> 01:30:44,736
Is' it needs to look?

1013
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,572
Yes. Chriss, You're doing great.

1014
01:30:47,114 --> 01:30:49,032
- Is a boy or a girl?
- I do not know.

1015
01:30:49,116 --> 01:30:50,742
For now only the head.

1016
01:30:50,742 --> 01:30:52,870
It is almost over. Once again
inflates... You can do it.

1017
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:57,541
Here it is great. Once again
inflates Chriss.Hajde!

1018
01:31:04,506 --> 01:31:06,550
Extracted it from me!
Extracted it, takes out!

1019
01:31:07,468 --> 01:31:09,178
Extracted it from it! Extracted it, takes out!

1020
01:31:12,306 --> 01:31:14,224
The girl.

1021
01:31:14,224 --> 01:31:15,976
A beautiful girl.

1022
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:21,523
This is my baby.

1023
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:41,293
Am I late?

1024
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:44,004
You have not, come see.
It's your baby.

1025
01:31:45,589 --> 01:31:46,673
Oh my God.

1026
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,637
We have a girl.

1027
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:00,896
Thanks.

1028
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:03,148
Thank you...

1029
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:32,010
See?

1030
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:34,930
It's really beautiful.

1031
01:32:36,306 --> 01:32:38,058
You know, it looks like
Tomislav Nikolic.

1032
01:32:38,267 --> 01:32:39,935
No vreðaj, Robert.

1033
01:32:40,477 --> 01:32:42,896
Chrissy, truth or challenge?

1034
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:46,191
True.

1035
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:49,027
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1036
01:32:49,027 --> 01:32:51,155
So much that I feel that I blows,
and spill luck everywhere.

1037
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,370
- Roberta, truth or challenge?
- True.

1038
01:32:58,453 --> 01:33:00,789
How big are you now sike?

1039
01:33:01,498 --> 01:33:02,875
And what are yours?

1040
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:06,420
36 D. And are worth every penny.

1041
01:33:08,547 --> 01:33:10,424
D? Who knew...?

1042
01:33:10,507 --> 01:33:12,092
I, the truth or challenge?

1043
01:33:12,301 --> 01:33:13,343
True.

1044
01:33:14,595 --> 01:33:16,138
Are you happy?

1045
01:33:16,388 --> 01:33:17,890
Not really.

1046
01:33:18,307 --> 01:33:21,143
AII, I guess it is normal to
zasrane matters.

1047
01:33:25,147 --> 01:33:28,192
Listen, I had the A +
"Building a career,"

1048
01:33:28,442 --> 01:33:30,986
but I guess I missed the hour
of "intimate relationships".

1049
01:33:30,986 --> 01:33:32,905
You may need to add
a little color to the outfit.

1050
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:35,699
Men like
pastel on women.

1051
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:40,329
It's not about pastelnoj,
or men.

1052
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:41,830
It's about me.

1053
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:45,667
What are you talking about, Sam?

1054
01:33:47,336 --> 01:33:50,506
I have had many relationships,
for many years.

1055
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:54,176
And from all I ran away,

1056
01:33:54,426 --> 01:33:56,470
we do not at all easy
transition to the next level.

1057
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:58,639
The level of intimacy...

1058
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:01,350
Well, if you do not fall in love,
you can not get hurt.

1059
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:04,436
But you probably like this alone.

1060
01:34:07,022 --> 01:34:08,607
Yes, I did.

1061
01:34:11,985 --> 01:34:13,904
I remember one summer
tame the wild?

1062
01:34:14,947 --> 01:34:17,157
Oh God... We loved the mystery.

1063
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:19,535
Is not it be fun summer?

1064
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,787
It was the best.

1065
01:34:21,787 --> 01:34:25,541
You know, I sent him Božiæne
Congratulations, and a little cash every year.

1066
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:28,794
But returned last year.

1067
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:30,420
Yes, he died.

1068
01:34:33,549 --> 01:34:36,969
You know, you just can not say this,
But, Pete was Johnnijev father.

1069
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:39,763
- Really?
- How do you know?

1070
01:34:40,013 --> 01:34:42,307
I remember last
session at the cemetery?

1071
01:34:42,808 --> 01:34:45,727
I returned and saw him
placed flowers on the grave Johnnijev.

1072
01:34:47,813 --> 01:34:50,941
He told me something, which we then
has not meant much to me mean now.

1073
01:34:52,651 --> 01:34:56,029
He said that will happen in life
things that can not be stopped,

1074
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:59,491
but that is no reason
I dismiss the world.

1075
01:35:06,582 --> 01:35:11,837
I realized that I was so
afraid of bad things,

1076
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:16,758
I missed all the good.

1077
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:21,472
I did not want to
I come back here.

1078
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:26,018
AII is really
glad I did.

1079
01:35:27,978 --> 01:35:30,772
I forgot how
worthwhile to have you as friends.

1080
01:35:33,484 --> 01:35:36,737
We are really happy
we have this dog kennels...

1081
01:35:37,196 --> 01:35:38,822
... And each other.

1082
01:35:44,119 --> 01:35:46,830
Part of me would like to
forever remain here.

1083
01:35:47,706 --> 01:35:50,375
I would not go that far.

1084
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:54,004
AII would be nice if more often
I come to visit.

1085
01:35:55,839 --> 01:35:57,090
I agree.

1086
01:35:57,174 --> 01:35:58,759
Let's make a deal.

1087
01:36:07,518 --> 01:36:10,062
All for one...
... And one for all.

1088
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:28,789
Come on...

1089
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:32,084
You can try to escape
and forget the disappointment,

1090
01:36:33,377 --> 01:36:36,505
but only when you accept your
past, you can move on.

1091
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:41,385
Perhaps Thomas Wolf more
will never go home,

1092
01:36:41,426 --> 01:36:44,847
but I found my way to
there... and I'm glad I did.
