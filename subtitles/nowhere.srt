00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:18,857
LA is like nowhere.

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,456
Everybody who lives here is lost

5
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,632
Hey, Dark.
- Hey what, Mel?

6
00:02:26,678 --> 00:02:28,905
You want me to?

7
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:37,436
Well.

8
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,796
Beg for it.

9
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:04,460
Hi. My name's
Montgomery.

10
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:08,959
Hi. - You have got the deepest,
blackest eyes I've ever seen.

11
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:14,113
It's like I could just tumble
right into 'em, fall forever

12
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:24,964
I just love the smell of fear and

13
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:29,874
boy mixed together, don't you, Kriss?

14
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:37,239
What're you gawking at?

15
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,715
Looks like we've got a deviant
on our hands here, Kozy.

16
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,740
And we just hate, hate, hate any

17
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:45,802
sort of deviation from the norm.

18
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:48,123
Deviants are the scourge

19
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:51,296
contaminating this Great Nation

20
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:02,031
Dark?

21
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:05,423
Are you flogging the puppy again?

22
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:08,752
Lemme in. I gotta wash
this crap off my face!

23
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,046
Mom, can you wait just a sec, please?

24
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:15,103
Honey, I have to rot my life
away in a 9-to-5 hellhole

25
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:19,275
to support your lazy, juvenile
delinquent ass, remember?

26
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,601
Sweetheart, chipmunk,

27
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:27,768
my little ray of sunshine

28
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,777
open up this motherhumping

29
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:32,231
door now!

30
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:37,460
Jesus, can you hold on?

31
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,781
Gripes, it's as soggy
as an armpit in here.

32
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:46,163
How long've you been in
that shower abusing yourself?

33
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:48,273
You pump your handle
too much, young man.

34
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,333
It's gonna wither up and fall off!

35
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,936
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!

36
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:56,931
Bitch.

37
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:33,399
Mel, I gotta make a
documentary about someone

38
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,596
I care about 'n' it's
due next Wednesday.

39
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,007
And who ever said you
care about me anyways?

40
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,632
Didn't I give you my Cap'n Crunch
Decoder Ring back in the sixth grade?

41
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:44,560
That was Angelique Tewksbury, dorkball.

42
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:49,332
Hey, take your shirt off.
Come on.

43
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,330
It'll give Professor Starkweather
a boner 'n' he'll gimme an 'A'.

44
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,576
I'm sure.
Take your Prozac, Dark.

45
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:56,573
What's the matter?
You scared?

46
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:58,820
No.
- Think of the scandal.

47
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,443
Everyone in class'll be all outraged.

48
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:06,485
Is this what you wanna see?

49
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:08,392
Oh yeah.
Man.

50
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,176
City morgue, you stab 'em, we slab 'em.

51
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:17,410
S'up, bonzo dog breath? Need
a ride to class? - Nah. I'm not goin'.

52
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:21,479
Dark, you are gonna totally bite the eight
whole credits you're retaking this semester

53
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,735
I gotta do some editing
on my 101 project, then

54
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:26,037
I'll prob'ly head over
to the Hole for some chow

55
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:30,645
Maybe I'll go with. I just got my period
so I'm in full-tilt pigout mode.

56
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,701
And make sure you edit my boobs out.

57
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:36,449
I do not want every wally on
campus oglin' my chimichangas.

58
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,778
Hey, Lucifer's not with you, is she?

59
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,276
I cannot stomach seeing her butt-ugly
likeness this early in the day.

60
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:43,257
Lick my box, Rover!

61
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,568
Clean the maggots out of it
first, you stinky oyster. - You guys

62
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:49,275
I mean it, Mel. I do not
want to have to look at that

63
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,286
tarantula woman over my morning espresso

64
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:54,445
Don't be a seizure queen.
We'll pick you up in fifteen.

65
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,266
Mel, I told you, I'm
editing - Seeya, loverboy.

66
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,533
How you can continue to frog that
annoying buttloaf when you have someone as

67
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,553
sexy 'nd rad as me around.

68
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:06,179
What would life be
without a little mystery?

69
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,173
Mel?
- Quoi?

70
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:12,680
You wenches done in there or what?
I gotta whiz like a busted firehose.

71
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:20,382
Finale.
- If it isn't widdle baby Zero.

72
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:22,340
Cut it out.

73
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:26,499
Bye, gross, huh?

74
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:31,069
So you uh, hittin'
Jujyfruit's party tonight?

75
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,062
Puh-leeze, Zero.
How did you hear about it?

76
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:37,797
You are not invited, shrimpskin.

77
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:39,948
You're barely old enough to shave.

78
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:42,160
Felch me.

79
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,673
C'mon, I got a date with Zoe
'n' she totally wants to go.

80
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,790
I already scored the
car from Mom. - Life sucks.

81
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:56,179
I have got the skeeviest zit sproutin'
right in the middle of my forehead.

82
00:07:56,227 --> 00:08:00,580
It's gonna be a full-on third eye by the
time we get to Jujyfruit's party. Hate that.

83
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:02,795
What I hate is when you
get a zit way down on your

84
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:05,014
back in a spot where you
can't even reach to pop it.

85
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:09,078
If you pop a zit on your forehead, you
can get blood poisoning and die, y'know.

86
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:13,171
Lucifer, you are so dumb, you should
donate your brain to a monkey science fair.

87
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:16,111
I read it in Mouth 2
Mouth, scrotal fungus.

88
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:18,168
Mel, what's this?

89
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:21,555
Dark being born.

90
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,340
Mature.

91
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:26,652
Yuk yuk yuk.

92
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:32,044
Whoa, Mel, back it up.
- What?

93
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:34,037
Just back up, alright?

94
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:43,291
Need a lift?
- Well

95
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,641
You're in my Modern
Society class, aren't you?

96
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:48,765
Yeah, I think. - Name's
Dark- thats "Dark" like

97
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:51,773
absence of light Or "Dork"
like we all call him.

98
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,017
Cram it, furburger.

99
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,958
This is Mel, 'n' the
loudmouth hag is Lucifer.

100
00:08:57,064 --> 00:08:59,012
Montgomery.

101
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,770
We're on our way to the Hole
for breakfast. Wanna join?

102
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:06,644
I, kinda have a class.
- We'll eat quick 'n' drop you.

103
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:11,089
C'mon

104
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:14,237
So what's with the camcorder?
You in film class?

105
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:17,528
Dark thinks he's gonna be
the next Clive Barker- right.

106
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:20,378
Eat my turbo, willya Lucifer?

107
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:25,454
Actually, I'm convinced I'm gonna die soon
in like a spectacular plane crash, fire,

108
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,011
chemical explosion
'n' I wanna film it so

109
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:31,293
there'll be this like cool
record of my own death.

110
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,234
So I take my camera
with me wherever I go

111
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:36,017
Isn't that just so bitchen

112
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:38,146
Will you please Shut
- Up?

113
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,182
How do you know?
- Know what?

114
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:43,718
That you're gonna, y'know die.

115
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:46,403
I feel it.

116
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:50,449
Like a prenomination.
- You mean "premonition".

117
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:55,698
Whatever. - Well, I don't understand,
how can you have one

118
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:57,599
if you can't even
pronounce the frigging word?

119
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,605
I am about to lose my temper, Lucifer.

120
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,573
And I am going to deck you.
- C'mon.

121
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:03,474
You guys

122
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,487
Alyssa.

123
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,463
Ooops.

124
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,876
Clumsy me.

125
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:17,366
Hi Montgomery.
What're you doing here?

126
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:21,188
Aren't you s'posed to be in
Thermonuclear Catastrophes class?

127
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:26,263
yeah, well, uh Hey.

128
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,201
Do you know what today is?

129
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:35,268
Friday?
- No, dodo-bird.

130
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:37,504
It's Armageddon Day.

131
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,146
The day the world is supposed to end.

132
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:42,619
Like have you heard of "The Rapture"?

133
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,858
The Siouxsie and the Banshees album?

134
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:49,800
No. It's like this radical religious
movement in South Cambodia.

135
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,827
And all these thousands
of people are giving up

136
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,615
their worldly possessions
and leaving their families

137
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,710
All in preparation for
'The Rapture", ascending

138
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:00,903
into Heaven on the day
that Christ returns to earth

139
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:03,110
and the world is destroyed.

140
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,438
And according to those
scriptures, today is that day.

141
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:10,827
So, like, what're
we s'posed to do?

142
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:13,696
I don't know.
- Alyssa.

143
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:17,403
Are you gonna join us back here on
Planet Earth sometime this decade or what?

144
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:21,205
Hi Dingbat.

145
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,507
Hey Montgomery.
- Hi

146
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,712
Alyssa, me 'n' Egg been
waitin' for like eons.

147
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:31,961
Hey, Dingbat. Can you, help me study for
the History of Lethal Epidemics midterm?

148
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:37,068
Sunday, nine-ish?
- Cool.

149
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:39,170
Are you goin' to the
Kick The Can game tonight?

150
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:41,113
Duh.
Yes.

151
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:43,542
C'mon. I am fully
prepared to pork major.

152
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,939
Bye, Montgomery.
- Bye. - Seeya.

153
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:51,190
I gotta burn these calories
fast before I blow up.

154
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:53,209
Let's go rollerblading or something?

155
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,031
I'd rather have my ball hairs
burned off with an acetylene torch.

156
00:11:57,245 --> 00:11:59,281
Well, that can be arranged.

157
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,750
I better get back to class.

158
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:05,419
Are you OK, man?
You look kinda pale.

159
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,320
Yeah, I'm fine.

160
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:10,616
I gotta go.
- We're on our way out, we'll drive you.

161
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,375
You sure y'don't wanna come with?

162
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,844
I think I'm gonna go to the recordstore.
- How now, brown cow?

163
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:19,745
Cowboy.

164
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,249
So, I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

165
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,602
Hey, you guys playin'
Kick The Can tonight? - Huh?

166
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:30,450
Kick The Can. At ten o'clock
in the old baseball field.

167
00:12:30,451 --> 00:12:34,147
Before Jujyfruit's party.
- You're gonna be there, right?

168
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,312
Sure.
- Okay.

169
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:38,345
Let's evacuate, please.

170
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:40,858
Hey, don't forget our gig at
the Buttcrack next Wednesday.

171
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:45,745
Who's opening? - Sandy Duncan's Eye and
Jayne Mansfield's Head.

172
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:48,955
Boge. I met the drummer for Sandy
Duncan's Eye at a party.

173
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,467
Reeks like a barnyard animal.
- So come late then 'n' just see us.

174
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,757
Hey, have you seen Bart around today?

175
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:04,154
Y'know, we were s'posed to rehearse this

176
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:06,810
morning 'n' he like
totally flaked again.

177
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,496
Barty boy. Haven't seen
you in a golden age

178
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,474
Yeah I've been busy.
- Busy jonesin', y'mean.

179
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,602
Whatev

180
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:24,791
C'mon, Handjob, quit screwin' around.

181
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:33,254
Hey Bart. To whom do we owe
the pleasure? - Hey Kriss, Kozy.

182
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:37,110
We were hoping you were
here for an appointment.

183
00:13:37,111 --> 00:13:41,521
Actually, me 'n' Handjob're just
conductin' a bit-o-business. - Oh bummer.

184
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,525
Isn't that a humongous bummer, Kriss?

185
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,836
Bart's here for my brand
of bliss today, ladies.

186
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,414
I dunno what to do.

187
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:56,091
It's hard enough bein' in a
band with your boyfriend, but

188
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,489
when stuff like this starts happenin'!
mean, what'm I s'posed to do?

189
00:13:58,524 --> 00:14:00,466
Fire him?

190
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:04,470
Or break up at least.

191
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:07,152
OK, ladies

192
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:15,658
SCARF!

193
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,370
Hey so what's up with my video, man?

194
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:28,634
I'm still in the
'conceptualizing' stages.

195
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:31,980
Don't worry, it's gonna
blow your testes off. - Yeah?

196
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:35,621
You 'n' Bart are like trapped inside
this like gigantic, slimy uterus

197
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:43,725
Glug.
- Are you gonna?

198
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:45,959
I promised my mom I'd stop for a week.

199
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,980
You? - I'm just gonna do a bunch of speed
later 'n' not eat for like three days.

200
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:57,602
Sorry
Sorry.

201
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,049
Isn't that.
- OhmyGod.

202
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,290
Well, I guess I'd
better go hunt for him.

203
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:11,170
Wait. Can you drop me at Aran's?
I wanna score the new Dead Puppies CD.

204
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:19,422
I'm sorry the door was unlocked 'n' I.
- Forget about it.

205
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:23,883
What's your name?
- Egg.

206
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:27,674
Well, I mean, my real name's Polly,
but my friends all call me Egg.

207
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:31,198
'EGG'? - It's dweeby, I know,
but it just kinda stuck.

208
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:33,163
Well, hi Egg.
- I'm...

209
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:35,686
I know who you are.

210
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:38,094
I'm not from another dimension.

211
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,678
He looks shorter in person.
- So what?

212
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,523
He's still the total
definition of yummy.

213
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,517
OhmyGod, whatdidhesay?

214
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,593
Nothing really, he just. He invited
me to go for a walk. - WHAT?

215
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:55,561
Hey, did y'hear what happened to Marcus?

216
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:58,040
His butthole fell out 'n' he
has to have surgery.

217
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,941
Oh Henry.

218
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:08,580
Oona-eye.

219
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,666
Are we still in reality?

220
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:19,644
My palm itches.

221
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,947
Where's your twin brother Shad?

222
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:30,263
Death:

223
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,676
Cool.

224
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:38,824
Have I ever told you that I love you?

225
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:42,395
Stow it'n'pay the lady, Shad.

226
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:48,680
Watch out, breeders! - Watch out
yourself, you freakin' lezbots!

227
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:51,482
Eat my Bermuda Triangle, Shad!

228
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:59,326
RACE!

229
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:10,070
You alright?

230
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,274
Kill.

231
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,869
Hey, look who it is

232
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:23,762
Hey Jana, isn't that your
muffdiving little sister over

233
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:26,663
there with her disgusting
Bosco-flavored girlfriend?

234
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:30,643
Insert it in your clammy
crevice, will you Shannon?

235
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:34,385
Hey, I think I need to pump again.

236
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:37,682
I could use a firm-up too.

237
00:18:38,488 --> 00:18:43,008
Puke-ity.
- Kiss it and make it better.

238
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:51,544
So what're you gonna wear
to Jujyfruit's party tonight?

239
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,844
Clothes.

240
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,999
Can I borrow your Human
Sexology notes from last Friday?

241
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:02,167
Am I, like, the only person on this
cosmic plane who ever goes to class?

242
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:05,468
Hey, do you think
Montgomery likes me?

243
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:08,109
He's weird.
- Y'think?

244
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:11,658
Yo, Alyssa!
- Hey Ducky.

245
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:16,630
Hi, Ducky.
- I just woke up.

246
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:20,047
Really? - You guys hear
Muriel's in Cedar Sinai?

247
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,077
Who's Muriel?
- My stepmom.

248
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,594
She's like way anorexic: she
passed out in her low-impact

249
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,008
aerobics class 'nd they had to
carry her out on a stretcher.

250
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,113
Oh, drag.

251
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,686
You guys gonna be at the
Kick The Can game later?

252
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:34,217
l am.

253
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:43,630
Later, tater-tots.
- Right.

254
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:47,486
Hi Elvis.

255
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:53,196
Where've you been?
- Places. Get on.

256
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,564
What does she see in that scuzball?

257
00:19:58,707 --> 00:20:01,917
You smell like a wet dog.

258
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,027
Complainin'?
- Nope, rreeeorrrr.

259
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:11,935
Y'seen Egg around?
It's her turn to recycle the aluminum.

260
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:15,512
OhmyGod. You haven't heard? Your
little sister just left here with you're not

261
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:19,116
even gonna believe this.
Do you ever watch Baywatch?

262
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,704
D'you think this is completely
freaky or what? - What?

263
00:20:22,744 --> 00:20:25,731
Y'know. Hangin' out, with me, like this.

264
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:28,494
Well it's alittle surreal, I guess.

265
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:33,916
You have no idea how sucky it
is being like, a "celebrity".

266
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:36,351
Everybody treats you like
you're not even a person

267
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,420
anymore, like you're
this thing, this entity.

268
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,563
You're eating dinner
in some restaurant, or

269
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:42,987
goin' to the movies or
whatever, and people stare

270
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:45,120
and point at you, start
whisperin' to their

271
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,495
friends like you're some
exhibit at a freak show

272
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:52,097
Wow.
- That's why I like being with you.

273
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:56,530
I mean, I don't know you that well or
anything, but you seem, I dunno, different.

274
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:59,935
Neat.
- Thanks.

275
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,463
Do you wanna sit?
- Sure.

276
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,950
OhmyGod. Jujyfruit's party is tonight
and I have no clue who to go with!

277
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:11,048
What about Jason?
- I'm going with Jason.

278
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:13,438
Well then, I'll go with Tomas.

279
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:17,040
I thought you were going with Tomas.
- Tomas has a dinky weenie.

280
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,020
You did Tomas?
- Ewww, I'm sure, gross.

281
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:21,995
I thought Jason was doing Tomas.

282
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:24,974
Jason is doing that Valley
sluthole llene Schwarzkopf.

283
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,881
Untrue. Says who? - llene.
- And you believe her?

284
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:31,725
Hello, she lives in Whittier!

285
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:35,005
If Jason did llene, then
he must've done Richard.

286
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,764
Who's Richard?
- llene's other scag.

287
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:40,437
Like she's totally into
these kinko threeways.

288
00:21:40,452 --> 00:21:42,352
llene is a whore.

289
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,327
Is Richard the surfer with the
hairlip that drives a black Jetta?

290
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:48,700
No, he's got a Lexus.
- I thought he hung himself.

291
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:52,003
No, he's, like, totally gorgeous.
Plus he's got a Lexus.

292
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:54,878
Is he gay?
- Who? Jason?

293
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:58,032
Richard?
- Tomas.

294
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:00,343
Well, duh.
What do you think, dingleberry?

295
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,316
I swear, Trudi, you can be so...

296
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,877
Yeah, I wanna write and direct

297
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:21,503
I have to ensure that
the artistic integrity

298
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:26,004
of this project isn't compromised

299
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:31,026
first thing Monday.

300
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:36,532
I ever-so-solemnly
swear. 'K.

301
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:41,972
Ciao, J. F. Christ.

302
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,140
Hold on.

303
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:52,418
Coming.

304
00:22:57,937 --> 00:23:01,191
Where is he?
Where is he?

305
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:04,848
He was here tike an hour or so ago

306
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:09,173
but no, man, he's not here now.

307
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:14,232
See Barty boy has left the building.
- Where'd he go man?

308
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:16,702
Did he say where he was going?
- Heaven.

309
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,607
He said he was taking a hike up

310
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,172
that or Stairway To Heaven.

311
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,368
Bye.

312
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:31,745
My hat.
Where's my hat.

313
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:36,752
So, are you in school?
Studying?

314
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:39,135
I dunno. Nothing.

315
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:43,992
Well I mean, a bunch of
stuff, nothing specific

316
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:45,998
Well, just as long as you
aren't in the Industry.

317
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:48,988
I have sworn off all actresses,
models, d- girls, you-name-it.

318
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:52,294
Forever.
I have this fantasy.

319
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,567
It's probably comball
or romantic, I know but

320
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,971
there's times when I
want to just disappear.

321
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:03,549
Meet up with someone special, and just
run away, never be heard from again.

322
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,512
Don't you think that'd be killer?

323
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:10,279
Me too.

324
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,901
I figured you'd be here.

325
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:27,935
Hey Dude. - Bart.
You promised me, man.

326
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:32,417
I'm sorry, Cowboy.
I'm really sorry.

327
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,885
You have got to get clean, man.

328
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:37,585
You've got to.
Or it's all over.

329
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:39,565
Okay?
You, me,

330
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,809
the band, the whole falafel.

331
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,769
I will, Cowboy.
You know I will.

332
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,756
I mean it this time, Bart.

333
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:51,371
C'mere,

334
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:55,723
come up here.

335
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:06,378
No, man.
Just get clean.

336
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:09,059
Look, I'll do anything to help you

337
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,198
through it but we
cannot do this anymore.

338
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,649
You get it?
No more.

339
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:23,301
I love you, dude.

340
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,039
Thirsty?

341
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:41,139
Dyin'.

342
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,297
So howyadoin', smiley?

343
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:51,683
OK now.

344
00:25:59,446 --> 00:26:02,673
Mel. Dark.

345
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,362
I love you, Mel.

346
00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:12,442
Totally true and pure Mutual.

347
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,869
1 just wish we didn't like get together
with so many other people 'n' stuff

348
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:22,344
Palooka, you know

349
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:26,565
that I firmly believe

350
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,255
that human beings are built

351
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:33,362
for sex and for love.

352
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,846
And that we should
dole out as much of both

353
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,839
as possible before
we're old and ugly and

354
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:41,020
nobody wants to touch us anymore.

355
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,752
I know

356
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:48,188
And just because I make it

357
00:26:49,535 --> 00:26:51,747
with other guys and girls

358
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:56,736
has no effect whatsoever
on my feelings for you.

359
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,661
Sometimes I feel so old-fashioned
and from another planet.

360
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,586
It's like I'm half a person
without you.

361
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:07,670
You are so cute.

362
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,985
Life is so complicated.

363
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:24,010
I wrote a poem for you last night.

364
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:28,180
Want me to read it to you?
- No.

365
00:27:30,306 --> 00:27:33,429
Hey Elvis
Do you believe in God?

366
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:39,680
I don't believe in anything.

367
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:46,963
You have to believe in something.

368
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:49,725
No I don't.

369
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,711
Tie me up.

370
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:58,968
OK, Mr. Kinky.

371
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,230
This OK?
- Tighter. Tighter!

372
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,358
Now the pants baby, the pants.

373
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:25,935
Okay now, spank me, baby.

374
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:30,174
Spank my hot, tight, rock-hard ass!

375
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:36,504
Harder! Harder! HARDER!

376
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:40,916
Uh, Elvis?

377
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:45,364
I love you.

378
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:49,801
Ditto, hugbunny.

379
00:28:55,162 --> 00:29:00,093
I love you, Lilith i love you
more than life, more than death,

380
00:29:00,094 --> 00:29:04,397
more than time more than
space I love you, I love you.

381
00:29:05,508 --> 00:29:09,638
I bet you say that to all the girls.

382
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:14,212
Mommy.

383
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,877
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

384
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:30,600
In this world of
depravity and perversion,

385
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:33,476
who is the Only One
that can lead you out

386
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:36,902
of the muck, out of
the dank, filthy swamp

387
00:29:36,903 --> 00:29:40,361
that mankind has
foolheartedly sunken into?

388
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:44,185
JESUS!

389
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:48,479
Jesus! Jesus who died
on the Cross for our sins.

390
00:29:48,557 --> 00:29:51,746
Welcome Jesus Into Your
Lives, Brothers and Sisters,

391
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:55,477
So That He Can Show You The Way
Into The True Kingdom of God!

392
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:58,301
I read someplace that that
dude's got like twelve wives.

393
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:03,441
I think I'm drunk.
- Most excellent.

394
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:10,503
To Destiny.

395
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:20,618
Hey.
- What?

396
00:30:28,824 --> 00:30:31,201
You are so beautiful

397
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:52,271
wait stop.

398
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:59,133
Don't play little innocent virgin with me,
babe. You want me. Admit it.

399
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,264
You wanna make it with me
so you can go back to say,

400
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,788
"Hey, I just screwed a big
star, aren't I just So Bitchen?

401
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:14,501
No please. Don't please, stop no.

402
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:17,305
What're you gonna do?

403
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,974
Sir? Excuse me, sir?
Is everything alright?

404
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:29,376
Yeah, everything's fine.
I just knocked over a chair by accident.

405
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:31,984
Sorry to bother you, sir.

406
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:34,846
Have a good evening.
- Thanks.

407
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:37,916
Well, that was a close
call, now wasn't it?

408
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:39,916
But tonight, tonight
is your lucky night,

409
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,072
little Egg, because
you're gonna get the best

410
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:44,182
dogging of your perky,
pathetic little life,

411
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:46,478
and you're gonna love
every single second of it.

412
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:49,378
You'll feel like you've just
died and went straight to Heaven

413
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:34,450
Dear, sweet and tender Bart.

414
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:41,426
How do you spell Relief?

415
00:32:53,376 --> 00:32:57,771
Isn't sex just the best
tension release there is?

416
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:01,905
It's like a really good, sweaty game of

417
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,312
racquetball
- only you get to come at the end.

418
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:12,354
I adore you.

419
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,913
What a nice thing to say.

420
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:22,546
Why don't we just bout the Kick The Can
Game 'n' hideaway here in my room forever?

421
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:24,946
What time is it?

422
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,483
No way.

423
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:30,449
I was s'posed to pick up
Lucifer twenty minutes ago.

424
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:34,814
Mel
- She is totally gonna roast my rump.

425
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,832
Mel
- Angelboy, I gotta go.

426
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:39,997
Mel, waitasecond.

427
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:44,974
Will you marry me?

428
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:51,322
You are too precious for words.

429
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,929
Okay, I'll see you at Kick The Can.

430
00:33:57,121 --> 00:34:01,125
'n' don't forget it's
your turn to provide the X.

431
00:34:05,902 --> 00:34:07,932
Love you, pooh butter.

432
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:10,197
Bye.

433
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,646
Zero?
- Yeah, Zoe, it's me.

434
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:37,637
Be right down.

435
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:48,191
Hey homey.
Why so jumpy?

436
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:53,193
I just. Nothing.

437
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:58,720
Strawberry.

438
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:05,458
I missed you.

439
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:08,229
You just saw me the day
before yesterday, kumquat.

440
00:35:08,262 --> 00:35:10,295
So?
I missed you anyway.

441
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:12,679
Y'mean "Gilligan" here missed me.

442
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:14,972
We both did.

443
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:18,691
You're our favorite person in
this whole, wide, scuzbucket world

444
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:23,113
You are the sweetest boy ever.

445
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,261
So did you get the address
to Jujyfruit's Party?

446
00:35:34,185 --> 00:35:38,563
Zero.
- Hey Would I ever let you down?

447
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:46,764
Hi honey.
How was school today?

448
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:50,969
Great.

449
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:54,870
Don't forget, the Father-Son Bowling
Championship is next Saturday.

450
00:35:56,411 --> 00:36:00,059
I won't forget.
- Hungry?

451
00:36:00,085 --> 00:36:03,409
There's leftover taquitos in the fridge.

452
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:07,404
Thank you.

453
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:33,076
Miracle AIDS cure
turns out to be a hoax.

454
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:36,744
The Atari Gang continue their
reign of terror in the city.

455
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:41,450
And Palos Verdes City Councilwoman
Andrea Sperling insists her teenage

456
00:36:41,514 --> 00:36:46,304
son was kidnapped and
experimented on by Space Aliens.

457
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,202
And now a word from our sponsor.

458
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:15,592
Tough tits, dickweed.

459
00:37:15,622 --> 00:37:18,363
You're It.

460
00:37:24,847 --> 00:37:26,965
Tabithatime.

461
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:18,492
1, 2, 3

462
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:22,058
4, 5, 6,

463
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,482
7, 8, 9, 10.

464
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:29,633
11, 12, 13

465
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:36,964
17, 18, 19

466
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,117
20.

467
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:44,798
There it is, babe.
The vast and arid wasteland of

468
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:47,801
glittering filth, emptiness and death.

469
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:50,191
Hooray.

470
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:55,962
Hey, did you hear about that
old guy in Brentwood who croaked

471
00:38:56,286 --> 00:38:59,995
and then by the time
his neighbors found him,

472
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:02,978
his dog had eaten half his face off?

473
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,482
Dogs eating people is cool.

474
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:16,819
Let the love feast begin.

475
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:30,306
Occupied, dude.
- Sorry.

476
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:33,152
Hey, you guys goin'
to Jujyfruit's Party?

477
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:35,982
Buzz off, twerp.

478
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,634
Assholes.

479
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,284
Goddamn chipmunks.

480
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:48,911
Now what?

481
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:58,207
Not there.

482
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,945
There.

483
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:28,328
Taste good?

484
00:40:49,623 --> 00:40:52,396
I just love the Milk
Chocolatey Goodness of...

485
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:56,009
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

486
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:02,518
What a' goomba.

487
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:05,479
You see him?
- He's fifty feet from the can

488
00:41:05,558 --> 00:41:09,316
and so blitzkrieged, he's
like staggering around.

489
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:15,025
Ducky?
- What?

490
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,672
Have you ever like, I know it's none of

491
00:41:18,673 --> 00:41:21,902
my business or anything,
but I kinda heard

492
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:24,876
this rumor that you're
kinda like waiting

493
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:27,848
for the right person.
- That is not true.

494
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:32,870
I've "done it", I'm sure.

495
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:36,486
With who? - Lotsa people.
A buncha different times.

496
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:54,546
What'd you do that for?

497
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:59,067
I think you chipped my tooth.
- C'mon.

498
00:42:00,264 --> 00:42:03,045
FREEEEEEEEEE!

499
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:18,801
Cripes, don't bust your ballsac.

500
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,821
You scared me.
- Obvious.

501
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:27,283
Has Dark been through here yet?

502
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:29,973
No.

503
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:32,820
Well, Ducky 'n' Dingbat're already free.

504
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,624
Dark is so swacked
he's already doing the Cujo.

505
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,252
Y'know, the "Cujo."

506
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:44,081
Oh.

507
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:47,307
Well, later.

508
00:42:47,638 --> 00:42:50,027
Don't let the Boogeyman get you.

509
00:42:50,307 --> 00:42:52,811
Right.

510
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:08,518
Jesus, Cowboy

511
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:21,306
Yum.

512
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:31,357
Your turn.

513
00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:34,503
Yabba-dabba-doo.

514
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:37,484
Let's go, baby.

515
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:43,192
Lets
go-go-GO!

516
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:54,546
I wanna DIE!

517
00:43:55,278 --> 00:43:57,364
LETS ALL DIE!

518
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,823
What is it?

519
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:06,539
Nothing. I just.

520
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:13,158
Have you ever wondered what would
happen if the Big Earthquake hit

521
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,066
and all the nuclear power
plants in California blew up?

522
00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:22,208
I mean, what would they do with all the

523
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:25,598
hundreds of thousands of dead bodies?

524
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:29,845
Babycakes, just go back to sleep.

525
00:44:55,772 --> 00:44:58,033
Polly, honey?
Everything alright?

526
00:44:58,109 --> 00:45:01,528
I'm fine, Dad.
- Y'want something to eat?

527
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:03,756
We saved you some shepherd's pie.

528
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,002
No, thanks.
- I'm not very hungry

529
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:10,303
Y'sure?
We can heat it up in the micro.

530
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:12,615
Thanks, Dad, really.

531
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:16,150
I ate already with Alyssa and Dingbat.

532
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:19,536
Maybe later then.
- OK

533
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:29,885
Are you lost, my little lambs?
Confused?

534
00:45:29,948 --> 00:45:33,440
Don't know where in this world to turn?

535
00:45:36,595 --> 00:45:38,603
Back in a flash.

536
00:45:52,942 --> 00:45:54,946
Damn.

537
00:45:57,845 --> 00:46:02,028
Godzilla?
You there, man? Pick up.

538
00:46:02,058 --> 00:46:06,173
C'mon, Hey, you gotta help me out, man.

539
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:10,725
i need the address for that party
tonight at that Jujyfruit dude's place

540
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,650
So when you get this message, leave the

541
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:16,611
address on my machine 'n' I'll beep in.

542
00:46:16,718 --> 00:46:19,081
Thanks, Holmes.

543
00:46:19,116 --> 00:46:23,171
Once we get there, I'm gonna rip Jujyfruit's
balls off 'n' wear 'em as beef earrings.

544
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,112
Yeah, well, they're not gonna go
with those shoes, you low rent whore.

545
00:46:26,236 --> 00:46:29,254
Hey, where's the crystal,
who's got the crystal?

546
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:31,895
Well?
Did you get the address?

547
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:34,119
You are a drug pig.

548
00:46:34,162 --> 00:46:36,140
I'm rubber, you're glue

549
00:46:36,188 --> 00:46:38,158
Didn't I tell you?
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, babe.

550
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:40,059
You're the Best!

551
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:43,005
Montgomery?

552
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:45,081
Mel?

553
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:47,949
Butthead hogbitch Lucifer?

554
00:46:52,065 --> 00:46:56,055
Anybody here?

555
00:47:25,124 --> 00:47:30,124
Montgomery. Dude

556
00:47:49,568 --> 00:47:52,295
FREEEEEEEEE!

557
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:58,072
My fellow children of God, will you
do me this one teeny li'l ol* favor? - Yes!

558
00:47:58,785 --> 00:48:02,685
Wherever you are, put down whatever
it is you're doin' And Close Your Eyes.

559
00:48:02,744 --> 00:48:05,221
C'mon, do it with me now.
Don't be shy.

560
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,557
Nobody's watchin'. Close
your eyes, shut'em tight.

561
00:48:10,412 --> 00:48:13,721
Now, along with me, think about Heaven.

562
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:16,093
Concentrate.

563
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:20,240
Get a full-color, widescreen
picture in your mind.

564
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:23,553
Ain't it nice?

565
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:27,473
Ain't it so
downright beau-ti-ful?

566
00:48:27,752 --> 00:48:31,067
Just feel it. Feel that White, Pure,

567
00:48:31,068 --> 00:48:34,934
Holy Light cascadin' through your veins,

568
00:48:34,935 --> 00:48:38,089
coursin' through your Body And Soul.

569
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:42,220
Praise Sweet Jesus! Whooaa!

570
00:48:44,643 --> 00:48:47,076
Now doesn't that make
you feel so much better?

571
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:51,671
Just thinkin' about
Going Straight To Heaven,

572
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:55,585
Doesn't it make you feel
Soooo Goshdurned Good Inside?

573
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,263
Inner Peace, Harmony,
Eternal Everlasting Salvation.

574
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:03,658
It is yours, people, All Yours.

575
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:06,882
And all you have to do is Believe.

576
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:12,372
Believe! Do you believe,
my fellow children of God?

577
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:14,341
We believe.
- What's that?

578
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:16,518
I can't hear you, brothers
and sisters. - We believe.

579
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,544
We believe.

580
00:49:18,604 --> 00:49:20,767
I CANNOT HEAR YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTERS!

581
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:24,368
We believe.

582
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,101
I CANNOT HEAR YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

583
00:49:27,102 --> 00:49:30,671
It's like I got cottonbalts
stuck in my ears! We believe.

584
00:49:31,498 --> 00:49:34,350
You at home, you gotta me help
out. You gotta let me know,

585
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:37,922
YOU GOTTA LET JESUS KNOW!
- We believe, we believe

586
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:42,243
LOUDER, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, LOUDER!
LET SWEET JESUS HEAR YOUR PROUD,

587
00:49:42,244 --> 00:49:44,882
STRONG, MAGNIFICENT VOICES ROARM!

588
00:49:45,204 --> 00:49:49,088
We believe we believe

589
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:52,661
We believe.

590
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:07,219
You are such the driving talent.

591
00:50:08,685 --> 00:50:12,330
Hey, loser.
- Looooooooser.

592
00:50:12,624 --> 00:50:15,712
Where's Montgomery?
Everybody else is free.

593
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,743
We can't wait around for
him all friggin' night.

594
00:50:17,774 --> 00:50:20,444
I saw him in the locker room a while ago.
Did you check in there?

595
00:50:20,492 --> 00:50:22,450
What's the matter, Dark?

596
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:24,546
Isn't that his cross?

597
00:50:25,126 --> 00:50:27,429
What, did he get bored
'n* go home or something?

598
00:50:27,479 --> 00:50:30,793
I swear, that guy is
so capital L-A-M-E.

599
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:32,967
I vote we migrate to the party, okay.

600
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:34,912
The keg's already extinct I'm sure.

601
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:37,453
Don'tcha think we oughta wait for him?

602
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,408
I mean, what if...
- He can hook up with us later.

603
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:41,473
He knows the address.

604
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:44,976
Besides, I don't know if it's
the 'stacey, but this place

605
00:50:44,977 --> 00:50:47,604
is startin' to give me the
heebies. - I gotta make a call.

606
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,677
I'll catch you guys there.

607
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:52,804
Bye. - Seeya.
Whatever.

608
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:02,846
Why're we stopping?

609
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:06,544
Are we lost, huggybear?
- 'Course not.

610
00:51:06,581 --> 00:51:09,583
I just, I'm figurin'
out the shortcut route

611
00:51:09,629 --> 00:51:12,339
Zero It doesn't matter.

612
00:51:12,387 --> 00:51:15,596
Imean, I really don't care
about that soggy or party.

613
00:51:15,642 --> 00:51:19,495
It probably sucks anyway.
- Zoe, we're gonna find it.

614
00:51:19,684 --> 00:51:23,039
I would never let you down.

615
00:51:24,602 --> 00:51:29,396
You are a dream come true,

616
00:51:31,008 --> 00:51:34,137
OK, out! You heard me, pinhead.

617
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:37,753
Get outta the car
before I perforate you.

618
00:51:41,245 --> 00:51:43,201
Please. It's my Mom's. She'll kill me.

619
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:45,689
Well, tell 'er that The Atari say

620
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,169
"thanks for the bitchin wheels, bitch!"

621
00:51:50,289 --> 00:51:53,686
Zero, don't—ZEROHH.

622
00:51:57,822 --> 00:51:59,907
Oh, cuddlepuppy

623
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:02,889
Hey, Mr. Sighvatssohn.
It's Cowboy.

624
00:52:02,968 --> 00:52:05,660
Is Bart in?

625
00:52:08,065 --> 00:52:10,548
I can't understand. What?

626
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:16,374
Speak English please. I. Mr. Sighvatssohn,

627
00:52:16,953 --> 00:52:18,914
I can't understand you.
Speak English please.

628
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,902
I don't know how to
How could this happen?

629
00:52:21,026 --> 00:52:23,061
Our beloved son.

630
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:27,420
Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my
God My baby My poor, sweet baby.

631
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,385
What?

632
00:52:31,457 --> 00:52:33,395
I don't know what.

633
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:38,922
Mr. Sighvatssohn?

634
00:52:39,968 --> 00:52:42,156
Gimme that!

635
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:46,050
I'm full of hate. I want to kill.
I'm full of hate. I want to kill.

636
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:48,166

00:52:48,247 --> 00:52:50,308

Isn't this fun?
- Sure.

641
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,910
Don't worry, smooshkins I love you.

00:53:21,989 --> 00:53:25,509
Me too.
Totally.

643
00:53:25,713 --> 00:53:28,707
But my mom is gonna wire a
car battery to my testicles.

644
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:39,459
Hey tadpoles.

Well, there's this party at Jujyfruit's.

00:53:44,985 --> 00:53:46,953

Ready?

649
00:53:57,436 --> 00:54:00,525
Assume the position.

650
00:54:01,163 --> 00:54:03,266
OhmyGod, have you seen Theresa lately?

651
00:54:03,297 --> 00:54:05,447
She gained like fifty
pounds in one week!

652
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:07,977
I warned her not to stop doing crystal.

653
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:20,071
Cool.
- Blood is cool.

654
00:54:20,203 --> 00:54:23,599
No honey, your tongue is cool.

655
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:31,010
Sick! Glory Hallelujah, I am so polluted

656
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:34,469
Awesome!

657
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:43,457
Jujyfruit.

658
00:54:43,716 --> 00:54:45,616
Wet party, amigo.

Yeah, hey, got any horse tranquilizers?

661
00:54:51,379 --> 00:54:54,262
Sorry, man, I took my
supply before I came.

662
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:58,515
But I have some cat-a-clys-mic—
Jujyfruit!

663
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:01,707
So, like, location of the kegger?

00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:13,425

667
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:15,449

Mel, we gotta talk.
- Yeah?

670
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:29,956
I think we need to
discuss our relationship.

671
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,238
What relationship?

672
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:36,071
Dark, Baby look, I don't think

673
00:55:36,072 --> 00:55:39,632
this is the time or the place.

674
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,917
Mel!

675
00:55:43,979 --> 00:55:47,515
Surf. Ski. 'sup?
- Sameole, sameole.

676
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:49,490
Hey Dirk.

677
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:51,775
We haven't seen you
since that time backstage

678
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:55,610
at the Palace after the
Engorged Gonads show.

679
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:14,719
You Tarzan, Me Jane.

680
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,954
Super-sonic!

681
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:22,696
Isn't that your twin brother?

682
00:56:27,144 --> 00:56:29,571
What?
Oh, hi sis.

683
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:32,911
Dad said for me to remind
you to mow the lawn tomorrow.

684
00:56:32,941 --> 00:56:36,194
Well, you can tell Dad to
kiss my grinnin* grunt lizard.

685
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:40,585
No wonder I feel so
randy all of a sudden.

686
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:42,590
C'mere.

687
00:56:50,729 --> 00:56:52,805
Hey.
D'you know Alonzo DeLosa?

688
00:56:52,851 --> 00:56:54,777
That dude never shuts up.

689
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,803
Well, he shagged this chick he
met at Jones a couple weeks ago,

690
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:59,213
and last Wednesday, he
woke up 'n' his pecker

691
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:02,121
was covered in itchy,
black, pus-oozing sores.

692
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,850
'Bout time.
- Bend over, robot.

693
00:57:05,851 --> 00:57:08,650
Where's Mel?
- Hey you guys, Bob's here.

694
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:12,105
Who's Bob? - That hermaphrodite
pornstar who can screw himself.

695
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:14,281
What's a hermafrodyke?

696
00:57:14,282 --> 00:57:18,069
Ducky, man. Phone call.
It's your parental unit.

697
00:57:19,213 --> 00:57:22,061
Hello?
HELLO?

698
00:57:22,528 --> 00:57:25,793
Hey, cutie.
Can I jizz on your face?

699
00:57:41,297 --> 00:57:45,417
Wait a second, Dad I can't hear you

700
00:57:53,302 --> 00:57:55,517
Hey, where's Lucifer goin'?

701
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:02,120

702
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:05,837
Okay.

703
00:58:31,212 --> 00:58:33,268
Ooopsie.

705
00:58:36,187 --> 00:58:38,087
Hi

00:58:40,505 --> 00:58:43,569
Your thing is out.

707
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:45,810
Huh?
Oh.

708
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:47,711
Sorry

709
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,019

Ewwwwww! Repulse-o.

712
00:58:57,131 --> 00:59:02,131
Guess I'll have to use
the other John, 'scuze me.

713
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,035
So're you gonna get with
Surf 'n' Ski tonight?

714
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:11,322
I s'pose.

715
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,825
Mel, are we still together, or what?

716
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:17,173
Dark

717
00:59:17,174 --> 00:59:21,180
I just wish things weren't so
messed up 'n' confusing, that's all

718
00:59:26,912 --> 00:59:29,305
Can't we just leave this place?

719
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:31,646
Can't we just leave this
whole planet behind and

720
00:59:31,647 --> 00:59:35,736
forget about everybody 'n' everything
and just like be in love 'n' stuff?

721
00:59:35,801 --> 00:59:37,986
oh Dark

722
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:42,400
Hello?
Put the drugs away and open up!

723
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:47,401
Dark, I Look, can't we
just deal with this later?

724
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:52,017
Okay?

725
00:59:52,357 --> 00:59:54,719

726
00:59:57,646 --> 01:00:00,651
I just really miss you, that's all.

727
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:05,500
Hello? L.A.P.D.

728
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,729
I gotta go pee.

729
01:00:15,823 --> 01:00:20,043

01:00:58,258 --> 01:01:01,059
What is what's wrong Dad

738
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:31,316
Hey Dark, have you seen Ducky?

739
01:01:31,377 --> 01:01:33,364
He disappeared.

740
01:01:33,502 --> 01:01:36,143
No.

741
01:01:38,322 --> 01:01:41,642
I think I'm gonna bail.
- How come?

742
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:46,872
'Cuz this party's about as
fun as an ingrown butt hair.

743
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,844

01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,040

01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:22,759

No poontang, that's for sure.

755
01:03:33,332 --> 01:03:35,587
Pardon my french.

756
01:03:35,648 --> 01:03:38,243
Hey, need anything?

757
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:40,945
Up, down, all around

758
01:03:41,356 --> 01:03:44,679
Nah.
I'm blowin'.

759
01:03:45,037 --> 01:03:48,752
It's been a gnarly day.
- Yeah?

760
01:03:48,793 --> 01:03:51,763
In the last eighteen
hours, I've seen four

761
01:03:51,764 --> 01:03:54,388
people get abducted by a space alien,

762
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:56,806
watched Ducky try to drown himself,

763
01:03:56,807 --> 01:04:00,950
plus I spent like 387 bucks
on CDs at Aran's. - Kick my mom.

764
01:04:01,647 --> 01:04:04,091
Hey, what CD's'd you score?

765
01:04:04,277 --> 01:04:06,785
Hey, punk. Remember me?
The one you sold the bad drugs to?

766
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:08,784
The one you ripped off?
- Elvis, baby, c'mon.

767
01:04:08,869 --> 01:04:10,802
Where's my money.
Huh, punk?

768
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:15,718
I, got some stuff in the car killer stuff
it's yours gratis. - Elvis, DON'T!

769
01:04:19,913 --> 01:04:22,257
Elvis, STOP IT!

770
01:04:26,149 --> 01:04:28,115
C'mon! C'MON ASSHOLE! C'mon.

771
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,799
Come and get me.
Come on big man!

772
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:53,027
Oh my God Elvis, STOP IT!

773
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:30,721
Dear Diary What a day.

774
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,618
I swear I have never been so depressed
and miserable and lonely in my entire life.

775
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,949
It's like I know there's got to
be somebody out there somewhere,

776
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:45,455
just one person in this huge,
horrible, unhappy universe

777
01:05:45,924 --> 01:05:50,132
who can hold me in their arms 'n'
tell me everything's gonna be OK.

778
01:05:52,378 --> 01:05:56,800
But how long do I have to wait
before that person shows up?

779
01:05:58,341 --> 01:06:02,345
I feel like I'm sinking deeper
and deeper into quicksand,

780
01:06:02,346 --> 01:06:06,279
watching everyone around me
die a slow, agonizing death.

781
01:06:07,807 --> 01:06:12,573
It's like we all know,
way down in our souls,

782
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:17,960
that our generation is gonna
witness the End Of Everything.

783
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:24,515
You can see it in our eyes.

784
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:28,340
It's in mine.
Look.

785
01:06:29,134 --> 01:06:31,074
I'm doomed.

786
01:06:33,748 --> 01:06:37,233
I'm only eighteen years old
and I'm totally doomed.

787
01:07:59,114 --> 01:08:01,604
Wait.

788
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:12,750
Jesus!

789
01:08:23,694 --> 01:08:26,516
Montgomery.

790
01:08:29,329 --> 01:08:32,970
The weirdest thing just happened to me.

791
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:39,147
Well, are y'gonna just stand
there with your mouth hangin' open,

792
01:08:39,663 --> 01:08:42,135
or are you gonna let me in?

793
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:45,132
Sorry.

794
01:08:51,706 --> 01:08:53,624
Thanks.

795
01:09:00,998 --> 01:09:03,438
So, like, what happened?

796
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:13,478
I got kidnapped by space aliens.

797
01:09:13,511 --> 01:09:16,026
Really?

798
01:09:17,228 --> 01:09:19,303
'n' then what?

799
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:22,809
Well, they did all these tests
'n' experiments 'n' stuff on me,

800
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:26,907
then I overheard them talking about
their plan to take over the earth.

801
01:09:28,869 --> 01:09:30,928
Then I escaped.

802
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:34,543
No way.
- Way.

803
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,241
FookinA.

804
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:40,403
I feel strange.

805
01:09:40,684 --> 01:09:43,457
I think I'm catchin' a cold or something.
- D'you wanna, um?

806
01:09:43,473 --> 01:09:46,991
Is it OK if I just, uh,
rest here for awhile?

807
01:09:47,025 --> 01:09:51,050
I'm suddenly like soooooo tired.
- Sure.

808
01:09:56,594 --> 01:10:00,224
Well, aren't you?
Gonna?

809
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:02,982
Yeah

810
01:10:13,615 --> 01:10:17,133
I, hope you dont take
this the wrong way.

811
01:10:18,183 --> 01:10:21,015
I mean, I know you and

812
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:24,104
Mel are like, whatever.

813
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:27,638
"Whatever" is right.

814
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:31,474
She's all, you know.

815
01:10:35,079 --> 01:10:38,947
It's not like I'm gay or anything

816
01:10:40,471 --> 01:10:44,195
and I know we kinda just met.

817
01:10:45,786 --> 01:10:49,013
But I really like you alot.

818
01:10:52,163 --> 01:10:54,815
And I think about you.

819
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:58,511
Me too.

820
01:10:58,831 --> 01:11:03,429
I mean, I feel the same about you

821
01:11:03,761 --> 01:11:07,242
Like when I was trapped in the pod
thing that the Aliens held me captive in,

822
01:11:07,508 --> 01:11:11,000
all I could think about
was what if they kill me,

823
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:17,239
and I never get to see you again?

824
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:20,880
This sounds retarded
and pathetic I know,

825
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:26,903
but all my life I've been searching

826
01:11:26,904 --> 01:11:30,537
for one special person on this awful,

827
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:34,389
scary planet who I can love,

828
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:39,718
who loves me for what I am.

829
01:11:41,878 --> 01:11:45,099
That is so poetic.

830
01:11:57,197 --> 01:12:00,165
Is it OK if i spend the night?

831
01:12:00,856 --> 01:12:04,189
I really wanna sleep next to you.

832
01:12:07,392 --> 01:12:10,275
Only if you promise

833
01:12:10,772 --> 01:12:13,555
to never, ever leave me.

834
01:12:15,182 --> 01:12:17,801
Deal.

835
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:53,272
What's is something the matter?

836
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:55,509
Montgomery.

837
01:12:55,549 --> 01:12:58,362
Montgomery, what is it?

838
01:13:02,074 --> 01:13:05,651
Montgomery, Montgomery,
Montgomery. Tell me what it is.

839
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:07,790
Please!

840
01:13:07,815 --> 01:13:11,148
MONTGOMERY-MONTGOMERY

841
01:13:12,312 --> 01:13:14,400
Ohmygod, stop

842
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:17,543
MONTGOMERY

843
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:33,013
I'm outta here.

844
01:13:34,305 --> 01:13:40,176
