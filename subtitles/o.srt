1
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:07,083
One con under escort.
Open gate one.

2
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:11,765
Man walking.

3
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:14,443
Open gate two.

4
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:22,806
Let's go. Face the wall.
Got one under escort.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,074
Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

6
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:40,642
- Good morning.
- Morning.

7
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:44,289
- State your name for the record.
- Daniel Ocean.

8
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:48,288
Thank you. The purpose of this
hearing is to determine...

9
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:51,485
...whether you are
likely to break the law again.

10
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:55,971
This was your first conviction,
but you've been implicated...

11
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:58,971
...in a dozen other schemes
and frauds.

12
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,607
What can you tell us about this?

13
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:05,251
As you say, ma'am,
I was never charged.

14
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:08,203
We're trying to find out...

15
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:11,211
...if there was a reason
for committing this crime...

16
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:14,246
...or just a reason
you got caught this time.

17
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:19,129
My wife left me. I was upset.
I got into a self-destructive pattern.

18
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:24,685
If released, is it likely you'd fall
back into a similar pattern?

19
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:29,250
She left me once. I doubt
she'd do it again just for kicks.

20
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:34,891
Mr. Ocean, what do you think
you would do if released?

21
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,851
- Chips, please.
- Sure.

22
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:03,042
- Change 150. Quarters or nickels?
- Quarters are fine.

23
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,282
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

24
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:18,605
20. Dealer has 19.
Good start.

25
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:26,123
- I'm going on break now.
- Here. Thank you very much.

26
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:30,086
- Good luck.
- You have a good one.

27
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,771
- How are you, sir?
- Hello, Frank.

28
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:42,043
I beg your pardon. You must have me
confused with someone else.

29
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:45,882
My name is Ramón.
As you can see right here.

30
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:51,847
- My mistake.
- No problem, sir.

31
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:54,647
The table's cold anyway.

32
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:59,210
You might want to try the lounge
at Caesars. Gets busy after 1:00.

33
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:01,165
- 1:00?
- Yes, sir.

34
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,731
Thanks, Ramón.

35
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,361
Thank you.

36
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:19,212
- Checking up on current events?
- Ramón?

37
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:24,168
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
can't get past the gaming board.

38
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:26,682
- You just got out?
- This afternoon.

39
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:28,208
You seen him?

40
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:33,323
I heard he was teaching movie stars
how to play cards. Why?

41
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,565
You have a plan already?

42
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:38,885
Are you kidding?
I just became a citizen again.

43
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:40,367
Officer Brooks...

44
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:45,124
...this is Danny Ocean. I was told
to contact you within 24 hours.

45
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:49,164
No, sir, I haven't
been getting in trouble.

46
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,125
No, sir, I haven't been drinking.

47
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,450
No, sir, I wouldn't even think
about leaving the state.

48
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:13,483
Hey, Russ! Rusty. What's up, man?

49
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:20,448
Let me ask you a question.
Are you incorporated?

50
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:24,288
You should think about it.
I talked to my manager...

51
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:28,089
- Bernie?
- Not Bernie. My business manager.

52
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:30,932
Actually, they're both named Bernie.

53
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:35,132
He said what we do could
be considered research...

54
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:39,212
...for a future gig, so I could
make it a tax write-off.

55
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:43,122
The one thing is, and this is
his thing and it's stupid...

56
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,211
...but I'd have to pay you by check.

57
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,488
Or we could just stick to cash.

58
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:56,048
Yeah, let's just stick to cash.

59
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:07,322
We'll begin with five-card draw.
Everyone remember that?

60
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:10,292
Who wants to start us out? Josh?

61
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:14,929
Josh. To the left.

62
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:16,647
Deal to your left.

63
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:18,366
- Shane?
- Hit me.

64
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:21,167
- It's not blackjack.
- Dude!

65
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:26,607
Looking at them doesn't change them.
You know what you have.

66
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:29,449
- Left. Left.
- Left, I'll get it.

67
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,729
Lady bets. Let's keep it moving.

68
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,288
- Blue.
- Blue, that's a 50.

69
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,131
- I'll call?
- Okay.

70
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,404
Shane's calling. 50.

71
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,286
What the hell, it's only
pocket change.

72
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:45,085
That's your business.
Pretend it's for a reason.

73
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,607
Yeah, thanks, man.

74
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:48,925
- Right.
- How many?

75
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,921
- Four.
- You don't want four. You wanna fold.

76
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:54,811
- I wanna fold?
- Fold.

77
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,368
Is that good?

78
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:59,810
You're done. Let's take that.
You're done.

79
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:03,168
You're done.
You have three pairs.

80
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:06,763
You can't have six cards
in a five-card game.

81
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,044
- Maybe one was mine.
- Wasn't me.

82
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:10,288
Fellas!

83
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,486
All reds.

84
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:16,292
What up, dog?

85
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:26,050
I'm gonna love spending your money.
I'm gonna get my car washed.

86
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:42,890
- How's the game going?
- Longest hour of my life.

87
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:46,608
- What?
- I'm running away with your wife.

88
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,491
Great.

89
00:07:57,453 --> 00:08:01,128
Isn't that hard, crossing over
from television to film?

90
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,210
Not for me, dude.

91
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,922
Hey, Russ. We got another player...

92
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,084
...if that's cool with you.

93
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:15,046
What do you do for a living?
If you don't mind me asking.

94
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,403
Why would I mind you asking?

95
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:18,967
Two cards.

96
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:21,607
I just got out of prison.

97
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:26,131
- Really?
- Why were you in prison?

98
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,644
I stole things.

99
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:32,209
You stole things?
Like jewels?

100
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,605
Incan matrimonial head masks.

101
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:40,412
- Any money in Incan matrimonial...?
- Head masks. Some.

102
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:44,492
Don't let him fool you.
There's loads if you can move them.

103
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:48,003
I'll take one. But you can't.

104
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:51,205
- My fence was confident.
- You don't need a fence.

105
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:54,803
- Some people lack vision.
- Everybody in cellblock E.

106
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,731
That's $500.

107
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,128
- What's the first lesson in poker?
- Never bet on the...

108
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,841
- Leave emotion at the door.
- Right, Topher.

109
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:06,772
Today's lesson:
How to draw out the bluff.

110
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:09,043
That much money, this early... .

111
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:12,563
He has nothing better than
a pair of face cards.

112
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,166
Barry?

113
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:18,287
All right.

114
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,451
I fold.

115
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:24,927
- Josh?
- Don't worry, I'm game.

116
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:29,684
I will see your $500
and I will raise you another...

117
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:33,569
...$500 of my own.
- That's a very handsome bet.

118
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:39,206
But don't push him too high, too fast.
Keep him on the leash.

119
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,324
- Holly?
- Call.

120
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,401
Call.

121
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:45,851
And I'll call.

122
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:52,882
I'll see your $500
and raise you $2000.

123
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:56,889
Guys, you do what you like.
That's a lot of money.

124
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:02,087
I'm staying in. He's trying to buy
his way out of his bluff.

125
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,972
- Josh?
- Two.

126
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:12,452
Thattagirl. Call.

127
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,527
- Call.
- Call.

128
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:19,965
Let's see them.

129
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:25,805
I'm not sure what four nines does,
but the ace, I think, is pretty high.

130
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,088
Thanks for the tip on bluffing.

131
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:34,448
Hey, Topher! How about an autograph?
Come on, real quick.

132
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:53,242
- God, I'm bored.
- You look bored.

133
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:57,522
How was the clink?
You get the cookies I sent?

134
00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:00,885
Why do you think
I came to see you first?

135
00:11:01,693 --> 00:11:03,923
- So tell me.
- It's tricky.

136
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:08,604
It's never been done before.
It'll need planning and a large crew.

137
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:12,724
- Guns?
- Not quite. High security. The take...

138
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,925
- The target?
- Eight figures.

139
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,964
What's the target?

140
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:21,410
When was the last time
you were in Vegas?

141
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:24,286
You want to knock over a casino?

142
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,924
The vault at the Bellagio.

143
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:47,407
If I'm reading this right,
and I'd like to think I am...

144
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:52,171
...this is probably the least
accessible vault ever designed.

145
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,164
You said three casinos?

146
00:11:55,413 --> 00:12:01,124
These feed into the Mirage and MGM
Grand, but every dime ends up there.

147
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:04,533
The Bellagio and the Mirage.

148
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:08,726
- These are Terry Benedict's places.
- Yes, they are.

149
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,686
- Think he'll mind?
- More than somewhat.

150
00:12:11,893 --> 00:12:15,806
You'd need at least 12 guys
doing a combination of cons.

151
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,605
Like what, you think?

152
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:22,841
Off the top of my head, I'd say you're
looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown...

153
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:25,362
...a Miss Daisy and a Leon Spinks.

154
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:29,322
Not to mention the biggest
Ella Fitzgerald ever.

155
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,286
Where will you get
the money to back this?

156
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:35,485
Hit these three casinos,
we'll get our bankroll.

157
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:38,002
Benedict's got a list of enemies.

158
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:41,928
But enemies with loose
cash and nothing to lose?

159
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:46,526
- Reuben.
- Reuben.

160
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:48,166
Hey.

161
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:51,688
Oscar, lower it a bit,
would you?

162
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:55,125
Sorry. You guys done?
Find what you want?

163
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,291
We'll take these for the night
to make copies.

164
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:01,371
- Whatever you need.
- Appreciate it.

165
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:09,761
What?

166
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:12,732
I need a reason.

167
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,848
And don't say money. Why do this?

168
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,089
Why not do it?

169
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:26,688
I just left the joint after
losing four years of my life...

170
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,851
...and you're cold-decking
Teen Beat cover boys.

171
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:33,803
Because the house always wins.

172
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,050
Play long enough,
the house takes you.

173
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:42,725
Unless, when that perfect hand comes,
you bet big. Then you take the house.

174
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,292
- You practiced that speech?
- Did I rush it?

175
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,888
It was good.
The Teen Beat thing was harsh.

176
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:56,763
I wonder what Reuben will say.

177
00:13:57,773 --> 00:14:00,207
You're out of your damn minds!

178
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:03,566
You're both of you nuts!

179
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:09,012
I know more about casino security
than any man. I invented it.

180
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:11,010
And it cannot be beaten.

181
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:14,250
They got cameras and watchers,
they got locks.

182
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,205
They got timers, vaults.

183
00:14:16,533 --> 00:14:19,843
They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris!

184
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:22,969
Okay, bad example.

185
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:24,851
It's never been tried.

186
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:30,250
It's been tried.
A few guys even came close.

187
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,002
You know the three most successful
robberies in Vegas?

188
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:36,124
Number three, the bronze medal.

189
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,325
Pencil neck grabs
a lockbox at the Horseshoe.

190
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:41,728
Grab the guy in the suit!

191
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:46,082
He got two steps closer
to the door than anyone before.

192
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:47,408
Leave the money!

193
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:49,490
Second most successful robbery:

194
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:54,011
The Flamingo in '71. This guy
actually tasted fresh oxygen...

195
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,169
...before they grabbed him.

196
00:14:56,693 --> 00:15:00,971
Of course, he was breathing out
of a hose for the next three weeks.

197
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:02,891
Goddamn hippie.

198
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:08,247
And the closest any man has come
to robbing a Las Vegas casino...

199
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:11,565
...was outside of Caesars in '87.

200
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,648
He came...

201
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,887
...he grabbed...

202
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,485
...they conquered.

203
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:27,890
But what am I saying?
You guys are pros. The best.

204
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:31,046
I'm sure you can make
it out of the casino.

205
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,403
Of course, lest we forget...

206
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:38,687
...once you're out, you're still
in the middle of the fucking desert!

207
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:40,526
You're right.
He's right.

208
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,406
Our eyes were bigger
than our stomachs.

209
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:46,650
- That's what it is. Ego.
- Yeah, blah, blah.

210
00:15:46,893 --> 00:15:49,726
- Thanks for lunch.
- The nicoise was delicious.
ç

211
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,970
- Sorry to bother you.
- Look, we go way back...

212
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:56,529
...and I owe you from the thing
with the guy.

213
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:59,088
- Our pleasure.
- I'd never been to Belize.

214
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:04,048
Give Dominic your addresses.
I got some furniture to send you.

215
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:10,850
Just out of curiosity, which casinos
did you geniuses pick to rob?

216
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:15,250
The Bellagio, the Mirage
and the MGM Grand.

217
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,330
Those are Terry Benedict's casinos.

218
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,808
- Is that right?
- That's right.

219
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,370
You guys...

220
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,092
...what do you got against
Terry Benedict?

221
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,803
What do you have against him?
That's the question.

222
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:37,564
He torpedoed my casino.
Muscled me out.

223
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:42,893
Now he's gonna blow it up next month
to make way for some monstrosity.

224
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:46,603
- I see what you're doing.
- What are we doing?

225
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:52,289
If you're gonna steal from Terry
Benedict, you better goddamn know.

226
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:56,446
This used to be civilized.
You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you.

227
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,445
But Benedict... .

228
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:03,122
At the end of it, he'd better not
know you're involved.

229
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,963
Because he'll kill you,
then he'll go to work on you.

230
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:12,283
That's why we have to be
very careful, very precise.

231
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,852
Well-funded.

232
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,843
You gotta be nuts, too.

233
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:21,166
And you're gonna need
a crew as nuts as you are.

234
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:26,091
Who do you got in mind?

235
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,452
- All right, who 's in?
- Frank C. Is in.

236
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:35,842
Frank has bronchitis and is applying
for a transfer to warmer climates.

237
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:42,362
Drivers?

238
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:45,001
- I talked to the Malloys.
- Mormon twins?

239
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,568
They're in Utah, off the job.

240
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:51,125
They're having
trouble filling the hours.

241
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:08,086
- Waiting, sweetheart.
- Good. Go.

242
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:09,612
- Waiting for you.
- Why?

243
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:11,610
- You're a little girl!
- Relax.

244
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:16,204
I'm going to get out and
drop you like third-period French.

245
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:17,681
Relax.

246
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:56,202
- Electronics?
- Livingston Dell.

247
00:18:56,493 --> 00:19:00,372
He's been doing surveillance
work for the FBI mob squad.

248
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,848
- How are his nerves?
- Not so bad.

249
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,289
Move in a little bit.

250
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:10,721
- Don't touch that.
- Why not?

251
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,163
Do you see me grabbing your gun
and waving it around?

252
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,847
Hey, RadioShack. Relax.

253
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:28,448
Munitions.

254
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,610
- Phil Turrentine.
- Dead.

255
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,169
- No shit. On the job?
- Skin cancer.

256
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:36,604
- You send flowers?
- Dated his wife for a while.

257
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:38,892
Basher's in town.

258
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:42,362
There may be an issue
with availability.

259
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:50,011
All right, chaps...

260
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:53,130
...hang on to your knickers.

261
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:12,683
Oh, leave it out!

262
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:18,283
You tossers!
You had one job to do!

263
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:24,609
That's all you used in the event?

264
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,005
- You accusing me of booby-trapping?
- Well?

265
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:32,206
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
Isn't that right?

266
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:34,092
Basher?

267
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,369
Peck. ATF.

268
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,332
Let me venture a guess.

269
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:43,772
Simple G-4 mainliner, back wound,
quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.

270
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:47,251
Let me ask you this.
You search this scumbag...

271
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:50,451
...for booby traps?
I mean, really searched.

272
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,132
Stand back.

273
00:20:52,453 --> 00:20:53,932
Here we go.

274
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,608
- Find Griggs. I need him.
- Who?

275
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:58,691
Just find him, will you?

276
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,523
Can you put something together
with what I gave you?

277
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:04,888
Done.

278
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:09,251
- Is Danny about?
- He's around the corner.

279
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:13,241
Terrific. It'll be nice working
with proper villains again.

280
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:15,763
Everybody down! Get down!

281
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,922
They weren't expecting that shit!

282
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:21,806
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

283
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:43,932
- Which one's the Amazing Yen?
- The little Chinese guy.

284
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:51,125
- Who else is on the list?
- He is the list.

285
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:57,483
It doesn't seem that diff...

286
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:10,366
- We got a grease man.
- We got a grease man.

287
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:15,447
We need Saul.

288
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:19,362
- He got out of the game a year ago.
- He get religion?

289
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:21,291
Ulcers.

290
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:26,325
- You could ask him.
- Hey, I could ask him.

291
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:55,891
I saw you at the paddock...

292
00:22:56,213 --> 00:23:01,003
...before the second race, outside
the men's room when I placed my bet.

293
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:05,211
I saw you before you even
got up this morning.

294
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:08,685
- How you been, Saul?
- Never better.

295
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:10,730
What's with the orange?

296
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:15,324
- My doctor says I need vitamins.
- Why don't you take vitamins?

297
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:18,048
You come here to give me a physical?

298
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:20,369
Box seats. Come on.

299
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:36,811
You gonna tell me? Or should I
say no and get it over with?

300
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:40,449
You're the best. You're in
Cooperstown. What do you want?

301
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,247
Nothing. I got a duplex now.

302
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:46,126
I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish.

303
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,928
I'm seeing a lady who works
the counter at Macy's.

304
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,010
I've changed.

305
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:59,846
Guys like us don't change.
We stay sharp or get sloppy.

306
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:01,965
Quit conning me.

307
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:04,483
That your hound way in the rear?

308
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,406
He breaks late.
Everyone knows this.

309
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:14,050
You going to treat me
like a grownup at least?

310
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,448
Tell me what the scam is?

311
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:48,609
Exhibit C: His belt as king
of the heavyweight crown.

312
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:52,808
Lennox Lewis has proven
he's the champion.

313
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:57,966
Saul makes 10.
Ten should do it, don't you think?

314
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:01,004
You think we need one more?

315
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:04,806
You think we need one more.

316
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:08,008
All right, we'll get one more.

317
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:25,970
Hello, Linus. Whose is this?

318
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,290
- Who are you?
- A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.

319
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:34,769
You're either in or out.
Right now.

320
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:41,532
- What is it?
- It's a plane ticket. A job offer.

321
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:46,282
- You're pretty trusting.
- Bobby has faith in you.

322
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:48,728
Fathers are like that.

323
00:26:49,093 --> 00:26:52,722
He didn't tell you? He doesn't
want me trading on his name.

324
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:55,686
Do this job,
he'll be trading on yours.

325
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:59,283
Don't, and you can go back
to feeling up stockbrokers.

326
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,768
Can you get the check, please?

327
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:06,964
That's the best lift you've made yet.

328
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:08,965
Las Vegas?

329
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:10,811
America's playground.

330
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:57,925
Did you guys get a group rate,
or something?

331
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,362
Saul, do you get out to Utah much?

332
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,128
Not as often as I'd like.

333
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:15,129
Check it out. I think you'd dig Provo.
You could do well there.

334
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:17,165
I'll look into it.

335
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:22,570
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Has everybody eaten? Good.

336
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:24,730
Everybody sober?

337
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:29,565
Close enough. Before we start,
nobody's on the line yet.

338
00:28:29,813 --> 00:28:34,204
What I'm about to propose is highly
lucrative and highly dangerous.

339
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,052
If that's not your brand of vodka...

340
00:28:37,253 --> 00:28:41,804
...eat as much as you like and have
a safe journey. No hard feelings.

341
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,685
Otherwise, come with me.

342
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,769
You're Bobby Caldwell's kid?

343
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:59,011
- From Chicago?
- Yeah.

344
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:02,408
- You like it there?
- Yeah.

345
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:06,492
That's wonderful.
Get in the goddamn house.

346
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:18,606
The 3000 block
of Las Vegas Boulevard...

347
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:22,204
...also known as the Bellagio,
Mirage and MGM Grand.

348
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:26,446
They're three of the most
profitable casinos in Las Vegas.

349
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:31,447
This is the Bellagio vault, located...

350
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:34,287
...beneath 200 feet of solid earth.

351
00:29:34,493 --> 00:29:39,362
It safeguards every dime that passes
through each of the three casinos.

352
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:42,531
- We're gonna rob it.
- Smash-and-grab job?

353
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:45,082
Slightly more complicated than that.

354
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:47,326
Well, yeah.

355
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:52,928
This is courtesy of Frank Catton,
a new dealer at the Bellagio.

356
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:54,532
Bad news first.

357
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:58,891
This place houses a security system
rivaling most nuclear silos.

358
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:03,962
First, we have to get in the casino
cages, which takes more than a smile.

359
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:06,562
Next, through these doors...

360
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:11,045
...each one requiring a different
code changed every 12 hours.

361
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:14,802
Past those, the elevator.
Here's where it gets tricky.

362
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:19,484
- It won't move without fingerprint I.D.
- Which we can't fake.

363
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:24,488
And vocal confirmation from the system
within the Bellagio and the vault.

364
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,166
Which we won't get.

365
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:29,285
The elevator shaft is rigged
with sensors.

366
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:34,123
If we override the lift, the exit
would lock and we'd be trapped.

367
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:37,604
Once we get down the shaft,
it's a piece of cake.

368
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:41,050
Just two more guards with Uzis...

369
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:44,882
...and the most elaborate
vault door ever conceived.

370
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:47,085
Any questions?

371
00:30:49,853 --> 00:30:51,571
Tunneling's out. There are...

372
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:56,443
...sensors monitoring the ground.
If a groundhog nested, they'd know.

373
00:30:57,013 --> 00:30:59,811
- Anyone else?
- You mentioned good news?

374
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:03,244
Yeah. The Nevada Gaming
Commission requires...

375
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:07,844
...a casino to keep enough cash
to cover every chip on the floor.

376
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:11,728
That means on a weekday, by law,
it must carry...

377
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:14,686
...between $60 and $ 70 million
in cash and coin.

378
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:18,886
On the weekend, between 80 and 90
million. On a fight night...

379
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:22,051
...in two weeks,
the night we're robbing it...

380
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:25,484
...$ 150 million,
without breaking a sweat.

381
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:29,569
There are 11 of us,
each with an equal share.

382
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:31,327
You do the math.

383
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:32,922
Exactly.

384
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,452
I have a question.

385
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:38,886
Say we get into the cage
and through the security doors...

386
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:41,368
...down the elevator
we can't move...

387
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:45,566
...past the guards with the guns,
into the vault we can't open...

388
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:50,211
- Without being seen by cameras.
- Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

389
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,007
Yeah, well, say we do all that...

390
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:57,684
...we're just supposed to walk out
of there with $ 150 million...

391
00:31:57,893 --> 00:32:00,327
...without getting stopped?

392
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:06,367
Yeah.

393
00:32:08,573 --> 00:32:11,565
Oh. Okay.

394
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:22,288
First task: reconnaissance.
I want to know what goes on...

395
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:25,246
...in all casinos,
from the dealers ' rotation...

396
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:31,244
...to the path of cash carts. I want
to know everything about every guard.

397
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:37,408
Find out where they're from,
nicknames, how they take their coffee.

398
00:32:37,693 --> 00:32:40,685
She dances at Crazy Horse Too,
to pay for school.

399
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:44,010
- I think she really likes me.
- Cool.

400
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:52,768
Know these casinos.
They were built to keep people in.

401
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,691
Know the quick routes out.

402
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:58,329
- He went through at 10:44.
- 10:46. Get a watch that works.

403
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:01,923
- You make me sick, dude. It's 10:44.
- 10:46.

404
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,285
Second task: power.

405
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:13,125
Fight night, we throw the switch
on Sin City. It's Basher's show.

406
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:16,052
You want broke, blind or bedlam?

407
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:19,484
- How about all three?
- Right, it's done.

408
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:22,571
Third task: surveillance.

409
00:33:22,813 --> 00:33:25,691
Security has an eye
and an ear on everything.

410
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:28,282
We want an eye and ear on them.
Livingston?

411
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:31,963
Not the least accessible system
I've seen, but close.

412
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:35,404
- There's no closed-circuit I can tap?
- No.

413
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:40,641
Then it's definitely a black bag job.
They employ an in-house technician?

414
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,492
Two. And one of them is lonely.

415
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,370
Thanks, Charmaine.
I'll return it in an hour.

416
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:04,725
- Say hi to your mom for me.
- Say it yourself. She's on-stage soon.

417
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:28,128
Watch it, bud!

418
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,131
- You call me bud, pal?
- You call me pal, friend?

419
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:35,121
- You call me friend, jackass?
- Don't call me jackass.

420
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:40,453
433, we have a visual impairment
on the northwest 052 exit-door camera.

421
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:43,368
Copy that. I see them.

422
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:15,402
- Is that a word? You made that up?
- "Obsequious" is a word.

423
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:28,730
- Please move your balloons.
- You got in my way!

424
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:32,130
- I was trying to deliver my balloons!
- Gentlemen!

425
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:37,248
- He's a balloon boy! Balloon boy!
- You're spitting in my face.

426
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:57,091
And we're up and running.

427
00:35:57,773 --> 00:36:03,131
- Why are hallways always that color?
- They say taupe is very soothing.

428
00:36:06,093 --> 00:36:08,209
- Hi.
- Fine, thanks.

429
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:21,409
- Move the balloons.
- Move them?

430
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,569
I have a client waiting for these.

431
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:29,086
I don't have time to fool around
with you circus animals.

432
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,528
Hey! Hold up a minute!

433
00:37:04,293 --> 00:37:05,851
Excuse me!

434
00:37:06,053 --> 00:37:08,931
Hey! Excuse me!

435
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:14,372
- Hey, you dropped this.
- Oh, thank you.

436
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:17,770
- How's the reception on those things?
- Excellent.

437
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:21,251
- Take care.
- Thanks.

438
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,847
- Well... .
- Yeah.

439
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,446
Fourth task: construction.

440
00:37:33,693 --> 00:37:37,049
We need to build an exact
replica of the Bellagio vault.

441
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,603
- To practice?
- Something like that.

442
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,731
Fifth task: intelligence.

443
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:46,767
We need those codes, Linus,
from the guy who has all three.

444
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,170
- Who, Benedict?
- Learn to love his shadow.

445
00:37:50,373 --> 00:37:54,889
- All I get to do is watch the guy?
- Gotta walk before you crawl.

446
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:58,564
- Reverse that.
- Sixth task: transport.

447
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:07,527
Well, I am sorry, but $ 18,500 a piece
is the best offer that I can make.

448
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,364
Well, I understand.

449
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:15,329
- They are some great-looking vans.
- Yes, sir, top of the line.

450
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:21,487
- Okay. Thank you for your time, Mr...?
- Denham. Billy Tim Denham.

451
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:26,525
- Denham like a jean.
- That's it. Just like the jean.

452
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:31,481
Man, you got some lovely hands here.
Do you moisturize?

453
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:34,082
- I'm sorry?
- I've tried lots of lotion.

454
00:38:34,293 --> 00:38:37,842
I even went fragrance-free
for a year. Now my sister...

455
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:42,604
...she uses aloe vera
with a little sunscreen in it.

456
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:47,084
Ideally, we all should
wear gloves to bed...

457
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:53,050
...but I found there was interference
with my social agenda, you know.

458
00:38:53,453 --> 00:38:58,686
Plus, I react to the camphor. So
I'm not into the traditional remedies.

459
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:02,249
Let me tell you something.
If you could pay cash...

460
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:04,603
...I could drop that
down to seven...

461
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:06,730
Sixteen each.

462
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:08,887
- No?
- Yes, sir.

463
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:10,731
- You'd do that?
- Yes, sir.

464
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:13,408
That'd be lovely.
They told me to see you.

465
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,890
- Well, I'm glad they did.
- They told me.

466
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:22,326
Well, let me go get the paperwork.
You just wait here at the table.

467
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,046
- You do that.
- Thank you.

468
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:35,686
- Very nice material.
- It's imported silk, Saul.

469
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:38,967
It's very nice.

470
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:44,083
Gentlemen, would you
excuse us for a second?

471
00:39:52,453 --> 00:39:55,604
Saul, you sure you're ready
to do this?

472
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:02,362
If you ever ask me
that question again, Daniel...

473
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:05,292
...you won't wake up
the following morning.

474
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:11,563
He's ready.

475
00:40:15,493 --> 00:40:19,168
My name is Lyman.
Zerga.

476
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:23,013
My name is Lyman Zerga.

477
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:28,003
My name is Lyman Zerga.

478
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:52,122
Okay, tell me about Benedict.

479
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,732
That guy's a machine.

480
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:55,127
Good afternoon.

481
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:58,848
He arrives at the Bellagio
every day at 2 p.m.

482
00:40:59,173 --> 00:41:00,572
How are you, Tommy?

483
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:02,729
He remembers every valet's name.

484
00:41:03,493 --> 00:41:06,166
Not bad for a guy
worth 3/ 4 of a billion.

485
00:41:06,373 --> 00:41:09,922
He works hard, hits
the lobby floor at 7 on the nose.

486
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,124
- Good evening, sir.
- How are you?

487
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,405
- Talks with his casino manager.
- About what?

488
00:41:15,613 --> 00:41:16,568
All business.

489
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:20,323
Benedict likes to know
what's going on. Be in control.

490
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:25,402
There's rarely an incident he doesn't
know about or handle personally.

491
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:30,368
Spends a few minutes
glad-handing the high rollers.

492
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:36,768
He speaks Spanish, German and Italian
and is getting good at Japanese.

493
00:41:38,693 --> 00:41:41,924
He's out by 7:30
and is handed a black portfolio.

494
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:47,168
Contents: profits and new security
codes. He heads to the restaurant.

495
00:41:52,973 --> 00:41:55,043
Like I said, a machine.

496
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:58,689
That portfolio contains
codes to all the cage doors?

497
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:02,363
And two minutes after they're changed,
he's got them.

498
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:08,448
You guys really can pick them.
This guy's as smart as he is ruthless.

499
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:12,845
Last guy he caught cheating,
he not only sent up for 10 years...

500
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:15,806
...he seized his house
and bankrupted his...

501
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:17,412
In-law's dealership.

502
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:22,045
He takes out your knees and ruins
your life and anybody you know.

503
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:23,606
You scared?

504
00:42:23,933 --> 00:42:25,525
You suicidal?

505
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,812
Only in the morning.

506
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,363
- Now what?
- Now comes the girl.

507
00:42:32,413 --> 00:42:35,405
She comes down after him
if they're in a snit.

508
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:39,970
- Where does she come from?
- The museum, there. She's the curator.

509
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:43,172
Here she is.

510
00:42:44,613 --> 00:42:47,332
This is the best part of my day.

511
00:43:00,293 --> 00:43:04,605
I'm not sure we can use her yet.
I haven't even caught her name.

512
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:06,531
Tess.

513
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:08,570
Huh?

514
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:10,365
Her name is Tess.

515
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:34,728
- We have to talk. Now.
- Okay.

516
00:43:39,013 --> 00:43:42,528
Tell me this is not about her
or I walk off the job.

517
00:43:42,893 --> 00:43:44,292
Who?

518
00:43:44,613 --> 00:43:47,286
Tess. Benedict.
Tell me this isn't about...

519
00:43:47,493 --> 00:43:50,405
...the guy who's screwing your wife.
- Ex-wife.

520
00:43:50,613 --> 00:43:52,922
- Tell me.
- It's not about that.

521
00:43:55,493 --> 00:44:00,123
It's not entirely about that.
Remember when we got in this business?

522
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:03,484
We said we'd play
like we had nothing to lose.

523
00:44:03,693 --> 00:44:05,411
Well, I lost something.

524
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:10,087
I lost someone.
That's why I'm here.

525
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:17,845
The problem is,
now we're stealing two things.

526
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:22,171
And if you can't have both,
which do you choose?

527
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:25,092
Remember, Tess does not split 11 ways.

528
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:30,851
If everything goes to plan, I won't be
the one that has to make that choice.

529
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,722
- How did she look?
- She looked good.

530
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:39,161
Thanks.

531
00:45:09,413 --> 00:45:10,732
You like it?

532
00:45:12,733 --> 00:45:15,167
I like that you like it.

533
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,129
- I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.

534
00:45:27,213 --> 00:45:30,489
In my hotel, there's always
somebody watching.

535
00:45:31,893 --> 00:45:33,372
I'll see you tonight.

536
00:45:47,373 --> 00:45:49,409
Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

537
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:53,888
I don't believe in weakness.
It costs too much.

538
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,727
I don't believe in questions either.

539
00:45:56,933 --> 00:46:00,005
Oh, really? Well then,
let me give you a tip.

540
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:03,763
Don't get into Terry Benedict
for too much money.

541
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,771
He doesn't fool around.

542
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:07,884
- How are you, Eddie?
- Fine, sir.

543
00:46:08,093 --> 00:46:09,367
Anything for me?

544
00:46:09,573 --> 00:46:13,851
Mr. Lyman Zerga. Third position.
Wants to talk to you privately.

545
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:17,041
Who is he?

546
00:46:17,253 --> 00:46:20,051
Businessman of some kind,
from Europe.

547
00:46:20,253 --> 00:46:24,451
Very vague. I asked around.
Word is, he deals primarily in arms.

548
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:26,610
- One of the biggest.
- Zerga.

549
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,411
Yes, sir.

550
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:32,243
- Never heard of him.
- That's why I don't doubt it.

551
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:36,128
- He's staying here?
- He's in the Mirador suite.

552
00:46:36,453 --> 00:46:39,968
- How's he doing?
- Up, almost 200.

553
00:46:41,413 --> 00:46:43,290
Good for him.

554
00:46:57,413 --> 00:47:01,929
You're 30 seconds late.
I was about to send out a search... .

555
00:47:03,213 --> 00:47:04,805
Hello, Tess.

556
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:07,851
What are you doing here?

557
00:47:09,013 --> 00:47:10,207
I'm out.

558
00:47:10,813 --> 00:47:12,041
- Out?
- Of prison.

559
00:47:12,253 --> 00:47:15,450
Remember? I went for cigarettes
and didn't come back.

560
00:47:15,693 --> 00:47:18,366
I don't smoke.
Don't sit.

561
00:47:18,893 --> 00:47:24,013
- They say I paid my debt to society.
- Funny, I never got a check.

562
00:47:24,493 --> 00:47:26,529
You're not wearing your ring.

563
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:30,803
I don't have a husband,
or didn't you get the papers?

564
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:34,928
- My last day inside.
- I told you I'd write.

565
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:42,723
- Danny, go now before...
- What? Benedict?

566
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:46,731
How you doing?
Whiskey and whiskey.

567
00:47:48,093 --> 00:47:52,450
You're doing a great job at the museum.
The Vermeer is quite good.

568
00:47:52,693 --> 00:47:56,572
- Vibrant. But his work fell off later.
- Remind you of anyone?

569
00:47:56,773 --> 00:48:01,563
I always confuse Monet and Manet.
Which one married his mistress?

570
00:48:01,893 --> 00:48:04,009
- Monet.
- And Manet had syphilis.

571
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:06,888
They also painted occasionally.

572
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:12,888
All right, I'll make this quick.

573
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:14,890
I came here for you.

574
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:19,929
I want to get on with my life.
I want you with me.

575
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:22,285
You're a thief and a liar.

576
00:48:22,893 --> 00:48:25,965
I lied about being a thief.
I don't do that now.

577
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:27,970
- Steal?
- Lie.

578
00:48:28,653 --> 00:48:31,042
Terry doesn't have to make
the distinction.

579
00:48:31,253 --> 00:48:34,245
He's clear on both.

580
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:36,769
- You have a problem.
- Only one?

581
00:48:36,973 --> 00:48:42,047
You've met too many people like you.
I'm with Terry now.

582
00:48:44,773 --> 00:48:47,207
Does he make you laugh?

583
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:51,571
He doesn't make me cry.

584
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:08,123
- The fight is Saturday night?
- Yes, would you like tickets?

585
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:11,962
No. Hand-to-hand combat
does not interest me.

586
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:15,483
I have a package arriving
here that evening.

587
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,487
A black briefcase, standard size...

588
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:23,046
...the contents of which
is very valuable to me.

589
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:26,049
I'll put it in the house safe.

590
00:49:26,253 --> 00:49:30,132
The house safe is for brandy
and grandmother's pearls.

591
00:49:31,173 --> 00:49:35,610
- I need something more secure.
- Mr. Zerga, I can assure you our...

592
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:40,449
I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
that your generosity in this matter...

593
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:43,412
...will not go overlooked.

594
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:49,245
Now, what can you offer me
besides the safe?

595
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:54,370
People you steal from have insurance.
They get made whole again.

596
00:49:54,693 --> 00:49:59,244
I had to leave New York to escape.
How do I get my five years back?

597
00:49:59,453 --> 00:50:03,492
- What you can do is not throw...
- You don't know anything.

598
00:50:03,693 --> 00:50:06,332
You don't love me,
you want someone else.

599
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:12,290
- I must live with that. But not him.
- Spoken like a true ex-husband.

600
00:50:12,493 --> 00:50:15,166
- I'm not joking.
- I'm not laughing.

601
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:19,161
There's a conflict of interest
when you give me love advice.

602
00:50:19,373 --> 00:50:23,332
Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm wrong.

603
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:28,526
Do you remember what I said
when we first met?

604
00:50:29,253 --> 00:50:33,724
- That I better know what I'm doing.
- Do you? Now?

605
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,125
You should go if you don't.

606
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,491
- I know what I'm doing.
- What are you doing?

607
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:42,725
Just catching up.

608
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:45,283
- Meet my ex-husband.
- Danny Ocean.

609
00:50:45,493 --> 00:50:48,007
- Mr. Ocean.
- I'm in your seat.

610
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:51,923
Forgive my lateness.
A guest required my attention.

611
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:56,251
That's fine. Danny was walking
through and spotted me.

612
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,444
- Is that so?
- Imagine the odds.

613
00:50:58,693 --> 00:51:01,366
Of all the gin joints
in all the world.

614
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:04,087
You recently were
released from prison?

615
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:05,248
That's right.

616
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:08,445
- How does it feel to be out?
- About the same.

617
00:51:09,573 --> 00:51:14,044
- Danny was just about to...
- I just stopped by to say hi to Tess.

618
00:51:14,253 --> 00:51:15,447
Stay, have a drink.

619
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:17,251
- I can't.
- He can't.

620
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:23,004
Well, then... .

621
00:51:24,093 --> 00:51:27,130
I imagine we won't see
Mr. Ocean anytime soon.

622
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:28,766
You never know.

623
00:51:28,973 --> 00:51:31,806
I know everything
happening in my hotels.

624
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:34,693
So I should put
those towels back.

625
00:51:34,893 --> 00:51:37,248
No, the towels you can keep.

626
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:44,932
- Good to see you, Tess.
- Take care, Danny.

627
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:47,169
- Terry.
- Danny.

628
00:53:09,493 --> 00:53:10,608
Stinking... .

629
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:12,206
Tomorrow the day is yours.

630
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:16,731
Call is at 5:30, makeup and costume.

631
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:20,608
Saul's package arrives at 7:05.
Linus grabs our codes.

632
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:25,763
All goes well, we're a go. At 7:30,
Yen is locked in and we're committed.

633
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:31,008
From this point, we have 30 minutes
to blow the power or he suffocates.

634
00:53:44,293 --> 00:53:47,842
Once the electricity goes,
access to the vault...

635
00:53:48,053 --> 00:53:52,604
...and its elevator shut down
for two minutes. That's when we go.

636
00:53:56,453 --> 00:54:00,366
You're in the middle of the room,
10 feet from everything.

637
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:04,288
You have to get to the door
without touching the floor.

638
00:54:04,773 --> 00:54:06,047
What do you do?

639
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:09,411
- Ten says he shorts it.
- Twenty.

640
00:54:16,813 --> 00:54:18,724
Window or aisle, boys?

641
00:54:20,013 --> 00:54:22,049
Yeah, we're in deep shit.

642
00:54:22,373 --> 00:54:25,888
That poxy demo crew
didn't back the main line.

643
00:54:26,213 --> 00:54:29,125
They naused up the mainframe.
Naused it up!

644
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:32,367
- You understand him?
- I'll explain later.

645
00:54:32,773 --> 00:54:36,732
They're so pony they blew
the backup grids one by one.

646
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:38,446
Basher, what happened?

647
00:54:39,053 --> 00:54:42,170
They did what I would have done
but by accident.

648
00:54:42,373 --> 00:54:45,843
Now they know their weakness,
they're fixing it.

649
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:50,765
So unless we intend to do this job
in Reno, we're in Barney.

650
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:55,727
Barney Rubble.
Trouble!

651
00:54:58,733 --> 00:55:01,167
- We could always...
- By tomorrow?

652
00:55:02,093 --> 00:55:05,563
Hang on a minute, hang on.
We could use a pinch.

653
00:55:07,853 --> 00:55:09,969
What's a pinch?

654
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:14,845
A device which creates a cardiac
arrest for broadband circuitry.

655
00:55:15,053 --> 00:55:18,443
Better yet, a pinch is
a bomb without the bomb.

656
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:22,606
When a nuclear weapon detonates,
its electromagnetic pulse...

657
00:55:22,813 --> 00:55:25,885
...shuts down any power source
within its blast radius.

658
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:30,883
It usually doesn't matter because
a nuclear weapon destroys everything.

659
00:55:31,173 --> 00:55:34,483
A pinch creates a similar
electromagnetic pulse...

660
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:38,885
...without mass destruction and death.
Instead of Hiroshima you get...

661
00:55:39,093 --> 00:55:41,402
...the 17th century.
- How long?

662
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:42,648
30 seconds.

663
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:47,609
Could a pinch knock out
the power of an entire city?

664
00:55:47,813 --> 00:55:50,725
- Like, for instance...
- Las Vegas?

665
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:54,411
Yeah, I think it might.

666
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:58,005
There's only one pinch
big enough to do it.

667
00:55:58,213 --> 00:55:59,328
Where?

668
00:56:12,013 --> 00:56:14,208
Let's go.
Yen, Basher, come on.

669
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:15,961
Where you going?

670
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:17,851
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

671
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:21,250
Oh, no, no, no!
Don't leave me with these guys!

672
00:56:30,293 --> 00:56:31,248
Start.

673
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:33,569
- I got one.
- You thinking of one?

674
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:37,044
- No, I've thought of one.
- You're thinking of one.

675
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:39,244
No, I'm done. I have it.

676
00:56:39,453 --> 00:56:40,886
- You a man?
- Yes. 19.

677
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:42,446
- You alive?
- Yes. 18.

678
00:56:42,693 --> 00:56:45,002
- Evel Knievel.
- Shit!

679
00:56:45,253 --> 00:56:46,845
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not.

680
00:56:47,053 --> 00:56:49,521
- Your hand's in my face.
- It's not.

681
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,526
- Am I touching you?
- Your hand's in my face.

682
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:54,445
- Move.
- I didn't touch you.

683
00:56:54,693 --> 00:56:57,605
- You just touched me.
- You made me touch you.

684
00:56:57,853 --> 00:57:00,367
This is your side.
This is your side.

685
00:57:01,613 --> 00:57:03,569
Get off. Get off.

686
00:57:30,453 --> 00:57:33,126
I'm gonna need a score
of car batteries...

687
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:36,484
Where's Linus?
Where's Linus?!

688
00:57:44,693 --> 00:57:48,049
- There he is.
- Oh, would you look at this doughnut?

689
00:57:59,493 --> 00:58:01,051
Should someone help him?

690
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:05,212
That's a great idea, Albert.
Let's all get nicked.

691
00:58:10,293 --> 00:58:11,487
Back it up.

692
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:29,332
Let him in.

693
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:38,808
You stupid bastard!

694
00:58:44,173 --> 00:58:46,209
- I say stay, you stay.
- Got it.

695
00:58:46,413 --> 00:58:49,485
Lose focus for one second,
somebody gets hurt!

696
00:58:49,733 --> 00:58:51,052
I got it.

697
00:58:55,253 --> 00:58:56,925
Where are they?

698
00:58:57,573 --> 00:59:00,929
That's what I want to know.
Where the hell are they?

699
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:04,808
- They will be here.
- "They will be here. " Schmuck!

700
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:14,044
You boys have a nice trip?

701
00:59:24,655 --> 00:59:26,134
We have a problem.

702
00:59:27,135 --> 00:59:28,966
You've been red-flagged.

703
00:59:29,175 --> 00:59:32,850
The moment you enter the casino,
they'll be watching.

704
00:59:33,055 --> 00:59:36,968
Like hawks.
Hawks with video cameras.

705
00:59:38,735 --> 00:59:40,453
That's a problem.

706
00:59:40,655 --> 00:59:43,294
- Saul, turn that off.
- When I'm ready...

707
00:59:43,495 --> 00:59:46,771
- Saul!
- It's off! It's off!

708
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:51,251
Any idea how this happened?

709
00:59:52,815 --> 00:59:54,043
- No.
- Oh, come on.

710
00:59:54,255 --> 00:59:58,931
He's been chasing Benedict's girl.
They had an argument two nights ago.

711
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,046
- I tailed you.
- Who told you to?

712
01:00:02,255 --> 01:00:05,247
I did. I worried you couldn't
leave Tess alone.

713
01:00:05,455 --> 01:00:06,649
- Tess?
- My wife.

714
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,250
- Ex-wife.
- Tess is here?

715
01:00:10,575 --> 01:00:14,773
I'm sorry. I didn't know if it
would sting you, but it did.

716
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,931
- You're out, Danny.
- He's out?

717
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:20,571
Or we call it off.
His involvement puts us at risk.

718
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:24,774
- It's not your call.
- You put her before us and made it mine.

719
01:00:24,975 --> 01:00:26,772
This is my job.

720
01:00:27,175 --> 01:00:28,130
Not anymore.

721
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:31,691
He can't just be out.
Who's gonna trigger the vault?

722
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:33,613
Kid, you up for it?

723
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:40,448
I can do it.

724
01:00:40,815 --> 01:00:44,285
Done. Locate the others.
Tell them the change in plan.

725
01:00:44,495 --> 01:00:46,087
Curtain goes up at 7.

726
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:51,085
Tess is with Benedict now?
She's too tall for him.

727
01:00:52,455 --> 01:00:54,730
Yes. No.

728
01:00:56,135 --> 01:00:57,807
Very much no.

729
01:00:59,935 --> 01:01:05,453
Then inform Mr. Levin he'll be better
off watching the fight at home on TV.

730
01:01:05,655 --> 01:01:09,364
Surely, he must have HBO.
That's it.

731
01:01:13,815 --> 01:01:14,884
Hi.

732
01:01:17,735 --> 01:01:20,295
What were you thinking about?

733
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:22,527
You.

734
01:01:25,135 --> 01:01:27,171
Where you gonna put your hands?

735
01:01:29,775 --> 01:01:31,094
No good.

736
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:35,170
Don't touch your tie. Look at me.

737
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:38,731
You need to answer my question.
Where do you look?

738
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:43,725
No. Look down, they know you're lying.
Up, and you don't know the truth.

739
01:01:43,935 --> 01:01:46,574
Don't use seven words if four will do.

740
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:51,969
Be specific, but not memorable.
Be funny, but don't make him laugh.

741
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:55,804
He's got to like you,
then forget you once you leave.

742
01:01:56,015 --> 01:01:59,007
And, for God's sake,
whatever you do, don't...

743
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,365
Russ! Can you take a look at this?

744
01:02:01,575 --> 01:02:02,928
Sure.

745
01:02:18,815 --> 01:02:20,214
Saul?

746
01:02:25,215 --> 01:02:26,614
It's time.

747
01:02:44,295 --> 01:02:45,648
Okay.

748
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:47,488
Let's do it.

749
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:53,334
On a perfectly clear night
in Las Vegas...

750
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:57,414
...with the expected crowd
of celebrities and sports fans...

751
01:02:57,615 --> 01:03:02,370
...piling into the MGM Grand, the two
best heavyweights in the world...

752
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:08,286
...prepare to meet after an eight-month
dance toward each other.

753
01:03:10,735 --> 01:03:12,009
Mr. Zerga?

754
01:03:12,495 --> 01:03:14,087
Mr. Benedict.

755
01:03:14,335 --> 01:03:19,363
- I'm very busy. Are we on schedule?
- I have no reason to suspect otherwise.

756
01:03:19,895 --> 01:03:23,524
My courier should be here momentarily.

757
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:46,845
Eighteen.
Blackjack!

758
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:03,930
Find Mr. Walsh. Tell him Mr. Ocean
is in the west slots.

759
01:04:05,615 --> 01:04:09,847
I can't have private security
personnel in the casino cages.

760
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,329
Of course not.

761
01:04:12,775 --> 01:04:15,653
Saul!
Saul Bloom, is that you?

762
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:19,012
Saul! Saul, it's me!
Bucky Buchanan!

763
01:04:19,215 --> 01:04:21,445
Remember?
From Saratoga!

764
01:04:25,335 --> 01:04:26,814
Mikael. Vladimir.

765
01:04:27,015 --> 01:04:30,451
Hey! Hey, Saul!

766
01:04:32,455 --> 01:04:33,888
Mr. Benedict, please.

767
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:38,247
I have never enjoyed the touch
of steel to my skin.

768
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,932
Lift them up, please.

769
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:59,605
I acknowledge your briefcase contains
nothing dangerous or illicit.

770
01:04:59,855 --> 01:05:03,530
I agree to take said briefcase
and store it in my vault...

771
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,606
...for a period of 24 hours.

772
01:05:06,095 --> 01:05:09,326
- I cannot allow you into the vault.
- Why not?

773
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:14,848
Insurance, for one. Security.
Most of all, I just don't trust you.

774
01:05:16,135 --> 01:05:18,205
Excuse me.

775
01:05:21,495 --> 01:05:25,727
I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
He's in the keno bar now.

776
01:05:25,935 --> 01:05:29,610
Mr. Zerga, this is my
casino manager, Mr. Walsh.

777
01:05:29,815 --> 01:05:34,013
He will have your briefcase stored
in our vault while you watch.

778
01:05:34,215 --> 01:05:36,524
Those are my terms.
Yes or no?

779
01:05:37,295 --> 01:05:40,526
You leave me no choice.

780
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,574
Dude, don't do that
in front of the pinch.

781
01:06:29,415 --> 01:06:32,487
Deep breaths.
You'll do fine.

782
01:06:32,735 --> 01:06:35,169
- Thank you.
- No sweat. You're a natural.

783
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:37,491
But don 't screw up.

784
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,173
- Who gets the penne?
- Right here.

785
01:06:52,895 --> 01:06:54,089
You ready?

786
01:06:56,255 --> 01:07:00,612
This is our security center,
where we oversee the casino and vault.

787
01:07:00,855 --> 01:07:03,449
You'll monitor your briefcase
from here.

788
01:07:03,655 --> 01:07:05,134
Don't let me keep you.

789
01:07:05,335 --> 01:07:08,054
- Mr. Zerga.
- Mr. Benedict.

790
01:07:13,855 --> 01:07:15,413
Linus, you're up.

791
01:07:16,735 --> 01:07:17,850
Got him.

792
01:07:18,215 --> 01:07:19,614
Mr. Benedict.

793
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:23,173
Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

794
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,809
I need two minutes of your time.

795
01:07:27,015 --> 01:07:28,926
- Anything for the NGC.
- Thanks.

796
01:07:29,135 --> 01:07:31,854
Will you accompany me
to pit five, please?

797
01:07:50,015 --> 01:07:52,768
- You make the deposit when?
- At your signal.

798
01:07:52,975 --> 01:07:56,809
What do we look like,
a couple of peckerwood jackasses?

799
01:07:58,175 --> 01:08:00,291
How does that feel?
You all right?

800
01:08:00,495 --> 01:08:03,168
Want something to read?
A magazine?

801
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,286
All right.
Counting down.

802
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:08,846
Thirty minutes of
breathing time starts now.

803
01:08:09,455 --> 01:08:11,969
This just came to our attention today.

804
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:15,212
Apparently, he's got
a record longer than my... .

805
01:08:16,095 --> 01:08:17,608
It's long.

806
01:08:21,295 --> 01:08:23,525
If he is who you say he is.

807
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,645
You been at the commission long?

808
01:08:31,255 --> 01:08:35,134
- About 18 months.
- You know Hal Lindley? Worked with him?

809
01:08:37,055 --> 01:08:39,364
Not since he died last year.

810
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:47,493
Ramón Escalante? Sheldon Willis,
Nevada Gaming Commission.

811
01:08:47,735 --> 01:08:49,248
What's going on here?

812
01:08:49,455 --> 01:08:53,892
- It's come to our attention...
- We should speak off the floor.

813
01:08:54,455 --> 01:08:56,411
Charlie.

814
01:09:17,055 --> 01:09:18,727
Thank you.

815
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:23,532
- No. I want you out of here.
- Give me one moment.

816
01:09:23,775 --> 01:09:27,165
- I've had it. I want you gone.
- Tess, come here.

817
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:29,013
You're up to something.

818
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:33,174
Don't say you're here for me.
You're pulling a job, aren't you?

819
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:36,606
Well, no matter what it is,
you won't win me back.

820
01:09:36,855 --> 01:09:39,369
Tess, I just came to say goodbye.

821
01:09:46,255 --> 01:09:48,007
Goodbye.

822
01:10:01,295 --> 01:10:03,251
You be good.

823
01:10:13,135 --> 01:10:16,047
- Mr. Ocean.
- Mr. Benedict wishes to see you.

824
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:18,167
I thought he might.

825
01:10:19,855 --> 01:10:21,971
Good afternoon, Mr. Escalante.

826
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,330
Or should I call you Mr. Catton?

827
01:10:25,615 --> 01:10:29,210
You're Frank Catton,
of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn...

828
01:10:29,415 --> 01:10:33,488
...and the New York state
penitentiary system. Are you not?

829
01:10:35,575 --> 01:10:39,170
I take it from your silence
you won't refute that.

830
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:43,449
Mr. Benedict, you're employing
an ex-convict. As you know...

831
01:10:43,655 --> 01:10:45,725
Goddamn cracker.

832
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:50,204
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

833
01:10:50,415 --> 01:10:53,134
Black man can't earn a decent wage?

834
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:56,685
- You wanna throw me on the street.
- I'm doing my job.

835
01:10:56,895 --> 01:11:02,208
Want me to get on the table and dance?
Shine your shoes? Smile at you?

836
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:07,729
You sure won't let me deal the cards.
You might as well call it whitejack!

837
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:14,884
I don't know what to say to that.
Race has nothing to do with it.

838
01:11:15,095 --> 01:11:18,405
- Yeah, right.
- What a horrible thing to say!

839
01:11:19,895 --> 01:11:25,527
You, of all people, know the NGC has
always supported hiring colored...

840
01:11:26,055 --> 01:11:29,604
- No! I didn't mean it!
- Okay. Come on, sit down.

841
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,645
- Sit down.
- You better talk to him.

842
01:11:33,295 --> 01:11:35,525
- He's got it.
- Sit down.

843
01:11:35,775 --> 01:11:38,414
Virgil. Turk.
Deliver the package.

844
01:11:50,135 --> 01:11:52,012
- Where's your card?
- I lost it.

845
01:11:52,215 --> 01:11:53,933
- You serious?
- I'm so stupid.

846
01:11:54,135 --> 01:11:56,729
- You are so stupid! You know that?
- Hey!

847
01:11:56,975 --> 01:12:00,604
You think it helps to call someone
names who's upset?

848
01:12:00,855 --> 01:12:04,370
- Hey! Keep it down.
- Sorry. Sorry.

849
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:08,090
- Where did this come from?
- High roller's room.

850
01:12:08,295 --> 01:12:11,731
- It's Mr. Benedict's stuff.
- Joe, take this inside.

851
01:12:11,935 --> 01:12:15,484
- Count room?
- No, to the vault.

852
01:12:15,735 --> 01:12:18,044
Benedict's money goes in the vault.

853
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:22,612
Next time, remember the card,
and we won't run into this again.

854
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:24,846
- Stupid.
- Jeez!

855
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:33,286
Yo! Hold that, please.

856
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:39,810
- There's your briefcase now, Mr. Zerga.
- Wonderful.

857
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:47,093
That's my cue.

858
01:12:48,055 --> 01:12:49,932
Give Basher the go.

859
01:12:50,895 --> 01:12:52,453
Bash, what's your status?

860
01:12:52,655 --> 01:12:56,045
- Bash!
- Easy. No need to shout, guv'nor.

861
01:12:56,255 --> 01:12:59,452
- What's your status?
- I'm nearly there.

862
01:13:16,495 --> 01:13:18,087
Come on, come on.

863
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:22,974
Mr. Walsh, show this man
off the premises.

864
01:13:23,295 --> 01:13:26,048
Don't ever set foot
in my casino again.

865
01:13:26,255 --> 01:13:27,449
Sir?

866
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:30,646
- Cracker!
- Oh, dear God!

867
01:13:38,575 --> 01:13:42,966
Oh! I forgot my pager.
I left it. Sorry.

868
01:13:44,495 --> 01:13:45,974
- Know the way back?
- I do.

869
01:13:46,175 --> 01:13:47,244
Good.

870
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:49,652
Okay. Enjoy the fight.

871
01:13:50,775 --> 01:13:52,288
Sorry!

872
01:13:57,615 --> 01:14:01,085
How much longer you figure
Mr. Benedict's gonna be?

873
01:14:10,415 --> 01:14:13,134
No cameras in this room, huh?

874
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,974
Yeah.

875
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:20,492
Don't want anybody seeing
what goes on in here.

876
01:14:23,095 --> 01:14:25,165
He's not coming, is he?

877
01:14:35,295 --> 01:14:39,049
We're gonna step outside.
Leave you to talk things over.

878
01:14:41,655 --> 01:14:45,773
I hadn't seen my wife in three weeks,
so I decided to call her.

879
01:14:45,975 --> 01:14:49,729
"I love you, you love me. "
"I miss you, you miss me. "

880
01:14:49,935 --> 01:14:53,086
That went well, but then
I went to this party... .

881
01:14:57,175 --> 01:15:00,292
I show up at 1 p.m.
She expected me at 11 a. M...

882
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:04,170
...so she was going crazy.
I said, "What do you expect?

883
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:07,970
What do you think goes on?
It's not choir practice. "

884
01:15:08,255 --> 01:15:09,847
Oh, shit.

885
01:15:12,935 --> 01:15:15,085
Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

886
01:15:15,295 --> 01:15:18,765
I am very satisfied.

887
01:15:21,295 --> 01:15:26,085
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

888
01:15:28,015 --> 01:15:29,334
All right.

889
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:35,214
Jesus!

890
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,974
Bruiser!

891
01:15:38,175 --> 01:15:42,407
- Not until later!
- Sorry, Danny. I forgot.

892
01:15:42,615 --> 01:15:44,128
It's all right.

893
01:15:45,815 --> 01:15:48,534
- How's your wife?
- Pregnant again.

894
01:15:48,815 --> 01:15:52,888
Well, it happens.
Let's get started. Come here.

895
01:16:20,775 --> 01:16:24,051
- You're almost there, Linus.
- Who's that guy?

896
01:16:24,495 --> 01:16:27,373
- I got a bogey in west corridor.
- Mr. Zerga!

897
01:16:31,255 --> 01:16:34,884
- Call a doctor! Mr. Zerga!
- Put this under his head.

898
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:37,893
Going to video now.

899
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:40,330
...to the Eye in the Sky ASAP.

900
01:16:40,535 --> 01:16:43,049
We have a man down
who's unconscious.

901
01:16:53,815 --> 01:16:55,373
Oh, Jesus!

902
01:16:56,495 --> 01:17:00,773
- Did you really think I'd sit this out?
- You didn't trust me?

903
01:17:00,975 --> 01:17:02,408
I do now.

904
01:17:03,095 --> 01:17:04,494
Come on.

905
01:17:32,975 --> 01:17:35,091
Someone call for a doctor?

906
01:17:43,735 --> 01:17:47,489
- How'd you get here?
- Had to give a friend two million.

907
01:17:47,735 --> 01:17:52,286
But what about Rusty? The argument?
I mean, what was that about?

908
01:17:53,855 --> 01:17:58,133
Come on. Why not just tell me?
Why put me through all this?

909
01:17:58,335 --> 01:18:01,452
Where's the fun in that?
Let's get going.

910
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,854
Come on, man! Breathe!

911
01:18:05,215 --> 01:18:07,524
Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

912
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:16,969
I'm sorry. We've lost him.

913
01:18:18,455 --> 01:18:21,970
- Dude, I told you to hurry.
- Don't do that. Just don't.

914
01:18:22,175 --> 01:18:24,006
I didn't tell you to hurry?

915
01:18:24,855 --> 01:18:27,574
Come on, get up! Get up!

916
01:18:32,735 --> 01:18:34,487
Had enough yet?

917
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:03,048
- These things will hold us, right?
- They should.

918
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,126
Livingston, we're set.

919
01:19:20,815 --> 01:19:23,613
- Livingston, we're set.
- Basher, we're set.

920
01:19:24,495 --> 01:19:26,565
Hang on a minute, chief.

921
01:19:26,815 --> 01:19:29,409
We don 't have one.
Yen 's gonna suffocate.

922
01:19:29,615 --> 01:19:34,086
Well, then you better leave off
bothering me, don't you think?

923
01:20:28,095 --> 01:20:30,006
All right, crack them.

924
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:41,048
Go.

925
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,854
Shit!

926
01:20:49,735 --> 01:20:51,009
Cut it.

927
01:21:14,895 --> 01:21:16,169
Hey!

928
01:21:18,095 --> 01:21:20,928
Pit six, table five.
Dealers compromised.

929
01:21:21,135 --> 01:21:24,491
Trade's breached at tables three,
five, six and ten.

930
01:21:35,615 --> 01:21:38,254
Get your coat.
Get your coat.

931
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:41,045
Look, this is crazy!
What...?

932
01:22:21,455 --> 01:22:23,286
Not yet.
Not yet.

933
01:22:28,455 --> 01:22:29,934
Go ahead.

934
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:35,854
- You think Yen made it out okay?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

935
01:22:37,135 --> 01:22:38,534
How we doing?

936
01:22:39,495 --> 01:22:42,168
Okay, I guess.

937
01:22:58,255 --> 01:23:02,851
There's a 95-pound Chinese man
with $ 160 million behind this door.

938
01:23:03,055 --> 01:23:05,205
- Let's get him out.
- Yeah.

939
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:17,605
- 10 cents he shorts it.
- No bet.

940
01:23:17,815 --> 01:23:19,453
Try him again.

941
01:23:49,815 --> 01:23:51,214
Okay.

942
01:23:58,095 --> 01:24:00,325
Hey.
Where we at, boys?

943
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:04,414
- Pins and floor sensors, now.
- Blinding.

944
01:24:10,815 --> 01:24:12,407
Here we go.

945
01:24:20,495 --> 01:24:23,532
Counting down from 20.
Now.

946
01:24:23,775 --> 01:24:25,094
Twenty.

947
01:24:27,815 --> 01:24:31,774
- Don't blow the door. Can you read me?
- Ten...

948
01:24:32,015 --> 01:24:33,846
...nine, eight...

949
01:24:34,055 --> 01:24:38,128
- Maybe the pinch blew out his earwigs.
- Do not blow the door!

950
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,814
...two, one.

951
01:24:50,655 --> 01:24:51,849
What's wrong?

952
01:24:52,055 --> 01:24:53,488
Something... .

953
01:25:05,655 --> 01:25:08,010
Did you check the batteries?

954
01:25:10,015 --> 01:25:13,291
You know, lose focus
in this game for one second...

955
01:25:13,495 --> 01:25:17,568
I know, somebody gets hurt.
You don't hear Yen complaining.

956
01:25:37,335 --> 01:25:38,768
Yen?

957
01:25:46,455 --> 01:25:48,491
Where the fuck you been?

958
01:25:51,055 --> 01:25:52,727
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

959
01:26:02,335 --> 01:26:06,567
That is the sexiest thing
I have ever seen.

960
01:26:09,815 --> 01:26:11,043
Rusty, you're up.

961
01:26:22,055 --> 01:26:25,604
- You gonna answer that?
- I don't have a cell phone.

962
01:26:29,495 --> 01:26:31,133
This isn't mine.

963
01:26:32,815 --> 01:26:34,373
See who it is.

964
01:26:36,295 --> 01:26:39,173
- Hello?
- May I have a word with Mr. Benedict?

965
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:40,854
It's for you.

966
01:26:45,255 --> 01:26:48,725
- Who the hell is this?
- The man who 's robbing you.

967
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:58,575
- What's going on in the vault?
- Nothing, sir. It's all normal.

968
01:26:58,775 --> 01:27:00,208
Show me.

969
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:05,093
- You're mistaken.
- Watching your monitors?

970
01:27:05,295 --> 01:27:07,525
Okay, keep watching.

971
01:27:16,935 --> 01:27:19,847
In this town,
luck can change that quickly.

972
01:27:20,055 --> 01:27:23,331
- Find out how much money's down there.
- Yes, sir.

973
01:27:39,575 --> 01:27:40,894
Tess?

974
01:27:41,535 --> 01:27:43,093
Tess?

975
01:27:43,935 --> 01:27:45,607
Perhaps you should... .

976
01:27:45,935 --> 01:27:47,766
Perhaps I should what?

977
01:27:48,615 --> 01:27:52,324
It would be better if you weren't
around here for this.

978
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:02,569
All right, you proved your point.

979
01:28:02,775 --> 01:28:07,690
You broke into my vault.
Congratulations. You're a dead man.

980
01:28:07,895 --> 01:28:12,491
- Maybe.
- Maybe? May I ask how you will leave?

981
01:28:12,815 --> 01:28:16,444
You think I'll let you
take my money out my casino doors?

982
01:28:16,655 --> 01:28:20,648
- No. You'll carry it out for us.
- Why would I do that?

983
01:28:20,855 --> 01:28:22,413
Look at your monitor.

984
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:28,486
As your manager's probably reporting,
you have over $ 160 million...

985
01:28:28,735 --> 01:28:32,648
...in your vault tonight.
We're only packing up half that.

986
01:28:32,895 --> 01:28:36,934
The other half we're leaving,
booby-trapped, as a hostage.

987
01:28:37,215 --> 01:28:41,254
You let our $80 million go,
and you get to keep yours.

988
01:28:41,455 --> 01:28:44,925
You try and stop us,
we'll blow both cashloads.

989
01:28:48,535 --> 01:28:54,292
You can lose $80 million secretly
or lose $ 160 million publicly.

990
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:55,769
Your decision.
Hi.

991
01:29:06,615 --> 01:29:08,173
Make the call.

992
01:29:13,295 --> 01:29:15,047
911 emergency response.

993
01:29:16,295 --> 01:29:19,207
- Where's Danny?
- He's fine. He's in good form.

994
01:29:19,415 --> 01:29:23,124
- He asks that you go up and watch TV.
- He does?

995
01:29:23,535 --> 01:29:28,131
We have three men with explosives
who have taken control of our vault.

996
01:29:30,815 --> 01:29:32,771
- Okay.
- It's okay.

997
01:29:33,175 --> 01:29:34,767
- You have a deal.
- I promise.

998
01:29:34,975 --> 01:29:37,489
Fantastic.
Here's what you do:

999
01:29:38,935 --> 01:29:42,564
The guys in the vault will put
six bags in the elevator.

1000
01:29:42,815 --> 01:29:44,612
It will rise to your cages.

1001
01:29:44,855 --> 01:29:48,814
Three of your guards will carry
the bags into the casino.

1002
01:29:49,215 --> 01:29:54,494
If they take more than 20 seconds
to reach the floor, or there's a switch...

1003
01:29:54,735 --> 01:29:57,169
...we'll blow all the money.

1004
01:29:58,895 --> 01:30:02,126
- He's in the casino by the slots.
- Of course I am.

1005
01:30:02,335 --> 01:30:07,534
I'm staying in your hotel.
I have two words for you: mini bar.

1006
01:30:09,215 --> 01:30:11,683
Once the guards
hit the casino floor...

1007
01:30:11,895 --> 01:30:17,094
...a white van will pull up outside.
Your guards will load the rear.

1008
01:30:17,295 --> 01:30:22,369
If anyone so much as approaches
the driver's door, we'll blow everything.

1009
01:30:23,735 --> 01:30:28,286
When I hear the van is away and
the money is secure, my men will leave.

1010
01:30:28,495 --> 01:30:31,931
Once their safety is confirmed,
you get your vault.

1011
01:30:32,495 --> 01:30:34,326
The S.W.A.T. team is here.

1012
01:30:35,895 --> 01:30:37,408
All right.

1013
01:30:37,615 --> 01:30:42,564
Now, I have complied with your
every request. Would you agree?

1014
01:30:42,815 --> 01:30:44,043
I would.

1015
01:30:44,495 --> 01:30:47,248
Good. Because now
I have one of my own:

1016
01:30:48,055 --> 01:30:51,684
Run and hide, asshole.
Run and hide.

1017
01:30:51,895 --> 01:30:56,730
If you're picked up buying a $ 100,000
sports car in Newport Beach...

1018
01:30:56,935 --> 01:31:02,009
...I'll be disappointed. I want my
people to find you, and when they do...

1019
01:31:02,215 --> 01:31:05,844
...rest assured, we won't
hand you over to the police.

1020
01:31:06,055 --> 01:31:10,606
So, my advice to you again
is this: run and hide.

1021
01:31:11,295 --> 01:31:13,570
That is all that I ask.

1022
01:31:35,055 --> 01:31:39,446
Mr. Benedict, our guys say that
van is headed for McCarran Airport.

1023
01:31:39,655 --> 01:31:43,091
I want my vault back
before that van hits the tarmac.

1024
01:31:53,015 --> 01:31:55,529
Night goggles on.
Prepare to cut power.

1025
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:00,129
Ready.

1026
01:32:02,855 --> 01:32:04,607
Cutting power now.

1027
01:32:06,895 --> 01:32:08,010
Do it.

1028
01:32:09,735 --> 01:32:11,965
Breaching elevator doors now.

1029
01:32:12,535 --> 01:32:15,845
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1030
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:17,524
Wait a minute.

1031
01:32:17,775 --> 01:32:19,527
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1032
01:32:19,775 --> 01:32:22,164
- Take him down, now!
- I got him!

1033
01:32:23,855 --> 01:32:26,813
- Lights! We need power now!
- Give it to him.

1034
01:32:37,935 --> 01:32:39,766
What's going on?
Talk to me.

1035
01:32:39,975 --> 01:32:43,968
It appears an explosive incendiary
device has been detonated.

1036
01:32:44,175 --> 01:32:47,724
Continuing search for survivors.

1037
01:32:47,935 --> 01:32:50,654
Tell them to take the van.
I'll be there.

1038
01:32:50,895 --> 01:32:53,853
And find out how they
hooked into my system!

1039
01:32:54,055 --> 01:32:55,534
Yes, sir.

1040
01:33:13,095 --> 01:33:16,292
Get out of the van, now.
Now!

1041
01:33:20,615 --> 01:33:22,287
Tires. Tires.

1042
01:33:38,455 --> 01:33:40,491
Our search yielded no suspects.

1043
01:33:40,735 --> 01:33:44,808
Nor can we determine how they
entered or exited the premises.

1044
01:33:47,215 --> 01:33:49,888
- Take your men out.
- May I suggest...?

1045
01:33:50,095 --> 01:33:51,528
Now.

1046
01:33:51,895 --> 01:33:54,853
It's your vault.
Blue team, move it out!

1047
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:05,250
Walsh, where are
we with the van?

1048
01:34:22,815 --> 01:34:25,568
I just want to try
something for a second.

1049
01:34:26,815 --> 01:34:29,045
There's nobody inside.

1050
01:34:30,655 --> 01:34:35,410
- I'm sorry. Did you want to get in?
- Enough monkey business.

1051
01:34:35,615 --> 01:34:37,173
Do it already.

1052
01:34:51,935 --> 01:34:54,927
Mr. Benedict.
We took the van, sir.

1053
01:34:55,135 --> 01:34:56,124
And?

1054
01:34:56,335 --> 01:34:59,532
They say there was no
money in the bags, sir.

1055
01:34:59,775 --> 01:35:01,254
What do you mean?

1056
01:35:01,455 --> 01:35:06,006
They say the bags were filled
with fliers, sir. For hookers.

1057
01:35:12,095 --> 01:35:13,164
Walsh?

1058
01:35:13,495 --> 01:35:15,247
Cue the tape to the robbery.

1059
01:35:17,735 --> 01:35:20,169
Yes, sir.
I'm looking at the tape now.

1060
01:35:20,895 --> 01:35:24,285
Does it say "Bellagio"
on the vault floor?

1061
01:35:24,495 --> 01:35:27,009
No, it doesn't.
I don't understand.

1062
01:35:29,255 --> 01:35:31,132
We had it installed Tuesday.

1063
01:35:31,335 --> 01:35:34,850
The images we saw of those
men robbing us was a tape.

1064
01:35:35,135 --> 01:35:36,329
What?

1065
01:35:38,255 --> 01:35:41,964
It was staged. Somebody made
a duplicate of my vault.

1066
01:35:42,175 --> 01:35:46,134
What we saw on the monitor
wasn't actually happening.

1067
01:35:47,175 --> 01:35:50,884
I don 't understand.
What happened to all that money?

1068
01:36:01,015 --> 01:36:02,243
Make the call.

1069
01:36:09,615 --> 01:36:11,526
911 emergency response.

1070
01:36:15,135 --> 01:36:17,171
- Night goggles on.
- Clear.

1071
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:18,808
Prepare to cut power.

1072
01:36:23,735 --> 01:36:26,169
Breaching elevator doors now.

1073
01:36:26,535 --> 01:36:29,607
We have two guards,
bound, unconscious.

1074
01:36:29,815 --> 01:36:30,930
Wait a minute.

1075
01:36:31,135 --> 01:36:32,853
Guys! Guys!
Someone's here!

1076
01:36:33,135 --> 01:36:35,774
- Take him down, now!
- I got him!

1077
01:37:22,455 --> 01:37:23,524
Open the door.

1078
01:37:29,615 --> 01:37:33,403
Hey, Benedict.
How's the other fight going?

1079
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:39,930
Pick him up.

1080
01:37:48,815 --> 01:37:50,646
Did you have a hand in this?

1081
01:37:51,855 --> 01:37:54,085
Did I have my hand in what?

1082
01:37:58,535 --> 01:38:00,491
I'll ask you one more time.

1083
01:38:00,735 --> 01:38:02,885
Did you have a hand in this?

1084
01:38:05,655 --> 01:38:09,489
Benedict, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1085
01:38:13,775 --> 01:38:15,128
Okay.

1086
01:38:16,335 --> 01:38:18,132
You're free to go.

1087
01:38:20,135 --> 01:38:21,807
Show him out.

1088
01:38:28,175 --> 01:38:30,735
- Hello.
- Turn to channel 88.

1089
01:38:30,935 --> 01:38:32,607
Who is this?

1090
01:38:41,255 --> 01:38:43,849
What happened, Benedict?
You get robbed?

1091
01:38:44,055 --> 01:38:45,488
Stop.

1092
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:58,410
I'll give you one last chance.

1093
01:38:59,455 --> 01:39:00,649
Where's my money?

1094
01:39:00,855 --> 01:39:03,892
What if I said you could
get your money back...

1095
01:39:04,735 --> 01:39:06,646
...if you give up Tess?

1096
01:39:07,215 --> 01:39:09,092
What would you say?

1097
01:39:12,015 --> 01:39:13,130
I would say yes.

1098
01:39:17,975 --> 01:39:19,203
All right.

1099
01:39:21,135 --> 01:39:24,047
I know a guy.
We were in the joint together.

1100
01:39:24,255 --> 01:39:28,328
Anybody pulls a job in the Western
U. S., he knows about it.

1101
01:39:28,935 --> 01:39:32,769
Give me 72 hours, I'll find
out who took your money.

1102
01:39:36,935 --> 01:39:38,891
You know a guy.

1103
01:39:41,495 --> 01:39:46,205
Contact the police. I'm sure he's
in violation of his parole.

1104
01:39:46,415 --> 01:39:47,848
Yes, sir.

1105
01:40:12,655 --> 01:40:14,088
Tess.

1106
01:40:15,935 --> 01:40:17,414
Tess.

1107
01:40:18,015 --> 01:40:20,449
You of all people
should know, Terry.

1108
01:40:20,655 --> 01:40:24,330
In your hotel, there's
always someone watching.

1109
01:42:00,655 --> 01:42:02,168
Wait!

1110
01:42:02,935 --> 01:42:04,209
Wait!

1111
01:42:05,615 --> 01:42:08,493
Wait, that's my husband!

1112
01:42:11,775 --> 01:42:15,051
- Danny.
- Tess, I told you...

1113
01:42:16,255 --> 01:42:18,166
...I knew what I was doing.

1114
01:42:19,015 --> 01:42:20,448
I didn't.

1115
01:42:20,655 --> 01:42:22,373
All right, let's go.

1116
01:42:23,535 --> 01:42:25,253
How long will you be?

1117
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:27,844
About three to six months, I guess.

1118
01:45:16,215 --> 01:45:18,092
I hope you were the groom.

1119
01:45:21,175 --> 01:45:24,770
Ted Nugent called.
He wants his shirt back.

1120
01:45:32,095 --> 01:45:36,293
Thirteen million and you drive
this piece of shit to pick me up?

1121
01:45:36,495 --> 01:45:38,247
I blew it all on the suit.

1122
01:45:38,455 --> 01:45:42,494
- Where are they?
- Back row, silver sedan. Ten o'clock.

1123
01:45:42,735 --> 01:45:46,330
I picked up your personal
effects. Hope you don't mind.

1124
01:45:48,735 --> 01:45:51,090
I'm not sure these belong to me.

1125
01:46:01,575 --> 01:46:02,974
- Hi.
- Hi.

1126
01:46:03,175 --> 01:46:04,449
Rusty needs a girl.

1127
01:46:04,655 --> 01:46:07,374
There's a women's
prison down the road.

1128
01:46:08,935 --> 01:46:10,891
You said that you sold this.

1129
01:46:11,095 --> 01:46:12,653
I said that.

1130
01:46:12,935 --> 01:46:14,334
Liar.

1131
01:46:15,975 --> 01:46:17,294
Thief.

1132
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:24,350
