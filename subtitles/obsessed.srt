2
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:43,999
Stop.

3
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,738
This is coming down.

4
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,782
What? Why?

5
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:52,609
No, I love the idea of the mirror
on the ceiling, but that's just ugly.

6
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,783
But the thing is, you look beautiful in it.

7
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:59,959
Now, see, if we're gonna take it down,
we gotta at least try it out...

8
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,308
christen the new house.

9
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:05,612
And what do you suggest we use
for a bed?

10
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:10,788
We don't need a bed, because we got
this fine carpet right here.

11
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:16,094
So I guess we'll have fine carpet
tattoos all over our asses.

12
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,572
Wait, baby,
don't you have to go to work?

13
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,790
I don't want any 30-second nookie.

14
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:26,313
I told them I'd be late. Now what?

15
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,097
- What about the movers?
- The movers?

16
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,836
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be here in an hour.

17
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:33,316
Which is just enough time.

18
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,968
Derek. You are so bad.

19
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:39,578
Like that isn't why you married me?

20
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:42,231
What about Kyle?

21
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:47,189
He'll be all right.
That boy will sleep through anything.

22
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:40,113
Gage Bendix?

23
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:42,766
Excuse me?

24
00:05:43,027 --> 00:05:45,723
I couldn't help but notice
we were both going to 22.

25
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:49,114
Gage Bendix, yeah. I work there.

26
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:52,376
I thought that you might.

27
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,898
You have an appointment with us?

28
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,551
Why, do I look like a client?

29
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:00,770
Actually, you do.

30
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:05,292
Well, well, I hate to shatter the illusion,
but I'm a temp.

31
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,250
You're a temp?

32
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:09,598
Girl's gotta pay the rent.

33
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:13,555
I would've never guessed a temp.

34
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,992
Let me help you out.

35
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:24,341
There you go.

36
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,996
There you go.

37
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:38,301
Thanks. I owe you one.

38
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:48,738
- Good morning.
- Morning.

39
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:53,739
Are you following me?

40
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,131
No, I'm taking these files
to Mr. Charles's office.

41
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:59,784
- Derek Charles?
- Yeah, I guess you probably know him.

42
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,177
Yeah, I know who he is
and he's an asshole.

43
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:05,786
Takes himself way too seriously.
But don't tell him I said that, okay?

44
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:08,351
- I could get you in trouble?
- Oh, yeah. Big trouble.

45
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,266
My lips are sealed.

46
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:12,875
- Patrick.
- Good morning, Derek.

47
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:14,614
- Hey.
- How's the new house?

48
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:18,093
Chaos, man, chaos. I got out
just as the movers showed up.

49
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:19,615
Sharon must have loved that.

50
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:22,181
Yeah, if she calls mad,
you tell her I'm in a meeting.

51
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:24,920
Hey. Remember who used to sit
at this desk, huh?

52
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,009
She'll know I'm lying.

53
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:29,922
Can I help you?

54
00:07:29,923 --> 00:07:31,489
That's Derek Charles?

55
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:33,228
Yes.

56
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,403
Better watch out, girl, he's married.

57
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:40,752
- The good ones are always married.
- Right. Or straight.

58
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,709
Did you talk to our German friend,
Herr Ganz?

59
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,144
Actually, I just got off the phone
with him.

60
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:48,884
- And?
- He doesn't like the way...

61
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:53,059
the stock market's gyrating, thinks
the hedge-fund wave is about to crest.

62
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,798
- You think he's right?
- No, no. I don't think he's right.

63
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,234
He's wrong. You know Ganz.

64
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,886
He gets paranoid when
anything goes mainstream.

65
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:01,365
So he makes a lot of noise...

66
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:05,802
but I managed to talk him into
a private-equity portfolio instead.

67
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,629
To the tune of 155 million.

68
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:13,629
I want you to throw Derek
your support on this.

69
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,891
I am just honoured
to exist in Derek's world.

70
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:17,456
Whose legs are those?

71
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:20,370
- Never seen them before.
- I think she's a new temp.

72
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,352
I think you mean temptress.

73
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:25,135
Always nice to have a girl
around the office, isn't it?

74
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:28,310
Derek married the last eye candy
we had, took her off the market.

75
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:31,659
Yes, sir. Miss us a little
Sharon around here.

76
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,226
I don't think you do.

77
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,095
- Patrick, forward my calls.
- Will do.

78
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:41,010
- Okay. Good night, Marge.
- Bye, Derek.

79
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,663
D, you cutting out early? I grabbed us
a couple tickets to the Lakers tonight.

80
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:47,011
You're killing me. I'm moving.

81
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:48,664
- I gotta get home.
- So?

82
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:51,056
So do I look like a man
who wants to get a divorce?

83
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,664
Why don't I call her and say we got
a work emergency? Come on.

84
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,796
- No, thanks, I'll stay married.
- Coward.

85
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,753
Yeah.

86
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:00,884
Goodbye, Mr. Charles.

87
00:09:04,452 --> 00:09:07,452
- You punked me.
- I'm sorry, but you set me up.

88
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:10,234
I'll get my revenge.
You might like to know...

89
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:13,757
- that everybody disagrees with you.
- About what?

90
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,148
About Derek Charles
being an asshole.

91
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,149
They say he's the nicest guy
in the firm.

92
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,106
Yeah, well, I've got them fooled.

93
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:21,759
I'm Lisa, by the way.

94
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,672
Hey, Lisa By The Way.

95
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:26,978
Good luck at your next job.

96
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:29,456
Hold the door, please.

97
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:31,587
They're keeping me on
for a few more days...

98
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:34,893
so I might see you on Monday.

99
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:04,640
Sharon!

100
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:05,814
Your turn.

101
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,945
No, I think it's your turn!

102
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:10,337
Don't even try it.
It's definitely your turn.

103
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:12,206
Looks like I'm stuck, huh?

104
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:13,989
Huh, Kyle?

105
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,121
Come here.

106
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,339
Oh, my God.
What is your mom feeding you?

107
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:04,699
What do you think about giving
that magic mirror another test drive?

108
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:07,351
Sharon, you're so bad.

109
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:10,134
Like that's not why you married me.

110
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,311
- Morning, Marge.
- Morning, Derek.

111
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:24,137
Hi.

112
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:25,834
Remember me?

113
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:31,052
Lisa By The Way, right?

114
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:33,923
Very good, I'm impressed.

115
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:38,889
Hey, Marge, where's Patrick?

116
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,229
Out with the flu.

117
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,272
I did some trading
with the other temps...

118
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:44,621
and I wrangled your desk.

119
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,187
I hope that's okay.

120
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:53,015
No, that's fine. Why don't you
grab a pad and a pen, follow me?

121
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,843
Here's a memo
for the Christmas party this Friday.

122
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:06,323
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

123
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,698
Sit down.

124
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,830
So why don't they invite spouses?

125
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:22,874
What?

126
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,265
To the party. It says no spouses.

127
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:29,919
Yeah, it's Joe Gage's rule. Actually,
it's like that at a lot of companies.

128
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,137
I guess they figure you're not gonna
kick back and let loose...

129
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:36,573
if your spouse is there.
The reason of having the party, right?

130
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:39,966
- So does this party get pretty wild?
- Oh, not usually.

131
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:41,401
Well, that's no fun.

132
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:44,924
I called Patrick. He said that
you like it black with 2 sugars.

133
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,619
If it's cold, I can go nuke it
in the kitchen.

134
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,880
No, actually, it's perfect. Thank you
very much. Let's get started.

135
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:53,795
- Ready when you are.
- It's Monday.

136
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:56,882
- First things first.
- Took care of that.

137
00:12:56,883 --> 00:12:58,404
Took care of what?

138
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:00,752
On Mondays you always
send your wife flowers.

139
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:04,232
This week you sent her a dozen
long-stemmed red roses.

140
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,581
I called to confirm
they've been delivered.

141
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:08,538
Thank you.

142
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:13,191
So how long have you two
been married?

143
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:15,756
3 years in March.

144
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:18,453
And you still send her flowers
every week. Lucky girl.

145
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:21,497
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition.

146
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:25,107
Patrick said that you started back
when she was your assistant.

147
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,281
You and Patrick had quite
a conversation.

148
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,020
- Let's run some calls.
- Fire away.

149
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,195
Why don't we start
with Phil Trendle?

150
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:33,587
See if you can get a lunch
appointment next week...

151
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:36,283
but push for The Water Grill.
I like the fish.

152
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:38,676
- The Water Grill's fantastic.
- Terry Mills.

153
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:42,025
- Am I going too fast?
- I'm just waiting on you.

154
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:45,025
Are you always this efficient?

155
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:46,721
Does that surprise you?

156
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:49,286
Yeah. Yeah, most of the temps
we get here, they're like-

157
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,288
I think you'll find
I'm not your typical temp.

158
00:13:55,246 --> 00:13:56,585
<i>We were at the grocery store,</i>

159
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,376
I look over and Kyle is flirting
with the checkout girl.

160
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:04,246
<i>She's about 16, and he's 2.</i>

161
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:08,248
<i>He was giving her the same look
you give when you see a pretty girl.</i>

162
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:12,380
<i>I think you've been teaching my baby
how to flirt. Like father, like son.</i>

163
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:15,989
<i>So, anyway, on the way home,
I stopped by campus today...</i>

164
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,338
<i>and I picked up a catalogue
for next semester's curriculum.</i>

165
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,078
<i>Let me tell you, I cannot wait.</i>

166
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,165
Do you need me?

167
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:30,036
<i>I'm gonna show it to you tonight.
I need your opinion on my courses.</i>

168
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,950
Are you listening to me?

169
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:41,778
Baby.

170
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:45,171
If I bundle Managerial Economics
and Operations Management...

171
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,780
then I won't take Management
Information Systems...

172
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:50,215
until next semester, right?

173
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:51,389
School?

174
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,433
- Derek.
- It's like an online degree?

175
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,521
Come on, baby, not tonight.
You know this is important to me.

176
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,174
Well, it's important to me too...

177
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:02,349
but I was kind of hoping you liked
being a mom, staying home with Kyle.

178
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,262
You know I love being a mom.

179
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:09,873
We got all this room. I make
enough money for you and I to-

180
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,916
It's not about the money.

181
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,134
We had an agreement.

182
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:16,874
You said that you'd work hard, I'd have
the baby, you'd get your promotion.

183
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,005
Then I'd get my degree.

184
00:15:18,006 --> 00:15:19,745
- I said that?
- Yes, you did.

185
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:22,441
You have something to talk about
when you get home.

186
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:24,180
I need some things to talk about.

187
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:27,399
- So Kyle's gonna be an only child?
- Let's get him a puppy.

188
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:30,294
A female that looks
like your side of the family...

189
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:33,512
- and tell him it's his sister.
- Can we call her Little Sharon?

190
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,034
Hey, Little Sharon. Come here.

191
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,991
You know exactly
who I'm talking about.

192
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:42,820
You know what, I wanna see you
say that in front of her face.

193
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:49,038
D? Why didn't you
call me back today?

194
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,300
- What time did you call?
- Around 4.

195
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:54,867
- You should leave a message.
- I did leave a message.

196
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:58,345
Oh, Patrick was sick,
and, you know, the temp-

197
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,302
We had a temp and she said...

198
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:02,998
Shannon called but didn't leave a number.

199
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:06,738
She? I thought we had an agreement,
no female assistants.

200
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:09,566
Baby, I don't control
temp availability.

201
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,175
Is she pretty?

202
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:13,349
Pretty plain.

203
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,784
Actually, you know what,
she did a better job than Patrick.

204
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,567
Except for messing up
your message.

205
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:21,090
- I want her fired immediately.
- Immediately.

206
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:23,787
- I'm serious.
- I promise.

207
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,310
Good night, Shannon.

208
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:36,136
Hope we're not interrupting
anything.

209
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:38,528
No, no, it's a treat to have you here.

210
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,704
I'm taking Kyle to The Grove today
to see Santa.

211
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:45,400
You wanna come?
Get your picture taken on Santa's lap?

212
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,314
No, I would, but I'm swamped.

213
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:49,489
You need me back in the office,
don't you?

214
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,185
Excuse me.
Here's your coffee, freshly nuked.

215
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:55,055
Hey, Lisa.

216
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:59,577
This is my wife, Sharon. Sharon,
this is Lisa. She's temping for Patrick.

217
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,404
It is such a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Charles.

218
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:05,449
- Hi.
- Hi. And this must be Kyle.

219
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,536
I can already tell
he's gonna be a heartbreaker.

220
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:11,277
Hi, Kyle. I'm Lisa.

221
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:12,625
Say hi, Kyle.

222
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:16,278
Oh, he can say hello. He's usually
not this shy around strangers.

223
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:19,888
What a handsome boy.
He looks just like you.

224
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:21,628
You think so?

225
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:24,541
Most people think he looks
like the beautiful Sharon.

226
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,280
Talk about the perfect family.

227
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:29,150
The 3 of you should be
on the cover of a magazine.

228
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,847
It's a good thing you won't be here
too long.

229
00:17:31,848 --> 00:17:34,195
I know my husband
can be very demanding.

230
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,717
Actually, I'm learning a lot
from your husband.

231
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:39,414
I bet you are.

232
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,459
Joe Gage needs to see you
when you have a moment.

233
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,112
Great.

234
00:17:46,286 --> 00:17:48,764
It's nice to meet you, Sharon.

235
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:50,287
You too, Liz.

236
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,417
- It's Lisa.
- Excuse me?

237
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:54,591
It's Lisa. You said Liz.

238
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:58,071
Sorry. Lisa.

239
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:06,116
- Sharon.
- Wasn't me. Blame Shannon.

240
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:08,377
- What's the deal with her?
- What do you mean?

241
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,292
" Looks just like you, Derek. "

242
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:13,162
But he is kind of handsome like me.

243
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:14,641
You said she was plain.

244
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:16,989
That girl may be a lot,
but she ain't plain.

245
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,424
I wouldn't know.
I only have eyes for you.

246
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:23,034
And you really think
that's gonna work?

247
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,817
Come on.

248
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:27,252
Take you around the office.
You can see the gang.

249
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:28,992
I know that you must miss it.

250
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:32,211
- When is Patrick coming back?
- Tomorrow.

251
00:18:32,602 --> 00:18:34,906
You better hope so.

252
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,616
Crudo.

253
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:53,926
Wow, look at the tree.

254
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,275
Christmas already.

255
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,537
- Hey, Stan.
- Good morning, Mr. Charles.

256
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:02,971
- I'm back.
- Patrick.

257
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:04,885
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, thanks.

258
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:07,929
You know it's gonna take a lot more
than some stomach bug...

259
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,147
to keep me away from
that Christmas party.

260
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:11,234
Yeah.

261
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:15,149
Not sure we can say the same
for Marge.

262
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,046
You get around, don't you?

263
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:23,568
Poor girl called in sick
with the stomach bug.

264
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,046
She caught it from Patrick.

265
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,656
That's what she gets
for using my lip gloss.

266
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,353
All right, girls.
Behave yourselves out here.

267
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,528
So how many times did you get busted
listening in on Derek's calls?

268
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,529
As if you don't.

269
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,617
I'm way too smooth
to ever get caught.

270
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,182
- I bet you are.
- How long have you been here?

271
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:48,488
- 10 years in April.
- I bet you know more...

272
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:51,184
about what happens behind
these doors than anybody.

273
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,315
Sweetie, you have no idea.

274
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,837
My nickname around here is 411.

275
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,447
411. Well, maybe we can grab
a cocktail after work sometime.

276
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,273
You can catch me up with girl talk.

277
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:05,187
If you think you can pump me for
information with a couple of Cosmos...

278
00:21:05,188 --> 00:21:07,188
you're right.

279
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:29,715
I'm sorry, I thought everyone
was at lunch.

280
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,107
- I should go.
- No.

281
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:35,151
You stay. Okay?

282
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:40,195
I'm gonna just grab my lunch and...

283
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:42,849
head on back to my office.

284
00:21:43,589 --> 00:21:45,590
Okay?

285
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:56,809
- You okay? You wanna talk about it?
- It's nothing.

286
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,810
Nothing?

287
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:05,289
You know, most people I know
don't cry over nothing.

288
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,725
You think I'm crying?

289
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,550
This is just allergies.

290
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:12,465
Oh, allergies, okay.
What are you allergic to?

291
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:17,380
Men, apparently.

292
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:19,511
Can I sit down?

293
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:23,295
Yeah.

294
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:29,469
You having boyfriend troubles
right now?

295
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,297
I'm beginning to think
there's something wrong with me.

296
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:37,298
There's nothing wrong with you.

297
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:40,255
I wish I could believe that.

298
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:48,519
Maybe you haven't met
the right guy yet.

299
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:51,562
I'm beginning to think
all the good ones are taken.

300
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:54,389
I'm no expert, but, you know,
if it didn't work out...

301
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,390
then maybe it wasn't meant to be.

302
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,303
Maybe.

303
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:02,521
And then, you know,
you're gonna meet the right guy...

304
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,173
you'll know immediately.

305
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,566
Is that how it was
with you and Sharon?

306
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:09,610
Yeah. Yeah, it does happen.

307
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:13,524
- Great. Now I'm jealous.
- Why?

308
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:16,047
She has everything.

309
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:19,309
Perfect husband, perfect child,
perfect marriage.

310
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,482
No. No, nothing's perfect.

311
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:25,179
You know, there are problems
in every relationship.

312
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,310
The most important thing
is to move forward.

313
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,920
You gotta keep moving forward,
you know?

314
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:33,920
Hey, Lisa, look, don't beat yourself up
over this guy.

315
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:37,556
Look at you, you're a bright,
attractive woman.

316
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:40,643
Any man would be lucky
to have you.

317
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:42,034
Yeah, right.

318
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:45,558
No. Honestly, if I were single...

319
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:47,733
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

320
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,516
Is it working?

321
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,516
Yes.

322
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,516
Good.

323
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,691
You hang in there, okay?

324
00:23:56,997 --> 00:24:00,910
It's gonna be just fine.

325
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:02,910
Thanks, Derek.

326
00:24:02,911 --> 00:24:06,911
Mister- Mr. Charles.

327
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:13,521
I'm sorry, excuse me.

328
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:16,523
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

329
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:20,132
What was that all about?

330
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:23,436
Oh, man, her boyfriend dumped her
and I was being nice.

331
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:26,742
I'll take up that slack.
That is one smoking hot piece of ass.

332
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:29,047
- Stop it, Ben.
- Come on. Like you haven't noticed.

333
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:31,178
No, dude,
I'm not in the game anymore.

334
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,570
I'm retired and coaching, as are you.

335
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:37,353
I'm still in the game. I'm just
on the bench, waiting to play again.

336
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:39,354
Careful, D.
It's not like the old days...

337
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:42,963
where you could get away with
office nookie and not get nailed for it.

338
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:44,180
Careful, D?

339
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:46,268
You went and married yours,
that's all.

340
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,052
If you're thinking of that girl-

341
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,052
- You saw her first.
- You are a fool.

342
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:54,271
Sadly, I don't think I'm her type.
Now, you, on the other hand...

343
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:57,489
All I'm saying
is that these single gals...

344
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,881
see the workplace
as their hunting ground.

345
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:04,491
And I think this one has got you
in her cross hairs.

346
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:21,206
Sharon. Hey.

347
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:25,816
I just put him to sleep, baby.

348
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:29,338
Red? Blue?

349
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,948
- Red? Blue?
- The red one.

350
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:40,167
- What you doing tonight?
- The usual. Formula, oatmeal.

351
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,906
How do I look?

352
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:45,254
- You look all right.
- I look all right.

353
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:49,127
Remember the last time you went
to that party and got drunk.

354
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:52,239
Kyle.

355
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,153
Eat something.

356
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,371
I will. I'm gonna grab a burger
at Jake's.

357
00:26:57,372 --> 00:27:01,329
- Okay. I love you.
- Okay. I love you too.

358
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:07,547
4th quarter, Derek Charles
puts it up, 3 seconds to go.

359
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:13,593
- I love you, baby.
- Bye. Eat something, baby.

360
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,817
- This seat taken?
- Yeah.

361
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:47,383
No, I'm kidding.

362
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:49,471
Be my guest.

363
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:55,386
- Look at you.
- It's a Christmas party.

364
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:57,038
Oh, yeah. You look great.

365
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,039
Thank you.
You grabbing a bite before?

366
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,430
Yeah. You too?

367
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,083
Brilliant minds think alike.

368
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:06,083
Thank you, John.
Still the best burger in town.

369
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,867
Really?

370
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:10,215
Hey, John? John?

371
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,476
John.

372
00:28:12,477 --> 00:28:16,217
- Can I have one too?
- Fix her up. The special.

373
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,176
- That was delicious.
- I told you.

374
00:28:25,177 --> 00:28:30,090
You know, we used to come back here
after a hard day's work and cut loose.

375
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:31,482
- Work hard, play hard?
- Yeah.

376
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:35,049
Back in the day,
I would throw them back too.

377
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:37,962
Hey, how's your boyfriend trouble?

378
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,179
- Keep moving forward, right?
- Exactly.

379
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,398
- All right.
- So, what's the grand plan, Derek?

380
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,572
Run the company by 35...

381
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:52,096
jet by 40, retire on my private island
and own the Lakers by 50.

382
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,531
- I'm a Sixers fan.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

383
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,315
I'll bring you around to my team,
okay?

384
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:00,011
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

385
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:02,576
Can-? Can I please have
a dirty martini?

386
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:03,837
Sure.

387
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,273
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

388
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,751
Oh, come on. Big talker.

389
00:29:09,753 --> 00:29:10,926
No, thanks.

390
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:15,232
- It's Christmas time. Work's dead.
- John, no.

391
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:18,711
- Bring one for my friend.
- How dirty do you want it?

392
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:20,799
Make it filthy.

393
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:26,670
This is for you.

394
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:35,975
Patrick? Patrick. Patrick.

395
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:39,742
Once again, great job as the head
of the decoration committee.

396
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:44,699
- You're like Santa's Little Helper.
- Well, I wouldn't let your people do it.

397
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:49,179
Hey, don't try this at home, huh?
You'll hurt yourself.

398
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:58,181
What's up?

399
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:00,226
What's going on?
You look beautiful.

400
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,270
I'll be right back.

401
00:30:03,488 --> 00:30:05,314
I'm coming for you, Derek.

402
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,880
- I'm coming for you.
- No. I don't dance.

403
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:11,793
No, come on, you don't wanna
with me. Okay, okay.

404
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:13,881
Yeah. All right.

405
00:30:15,143 --> 00:30:17,707
- Is this you, Marge?
- That's me.

406
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,535
Let me get some of that boogie.

407
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:25,014
- Didn't know you could move like that.
- Because I'm stuck behind a desk.

408
00:30:25,015 --> 00:30:29,407
- Okay, you do have legs under there.
- Oh, yes, I do.

409
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:36,278
- All right. You are smooth.
- Smooth, baby, real smooth.

410
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,061
- Really smooth.
- I'm coming in.

411
00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:41,062
All righty, baby. He's all yours.

412
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:46,062
- Hey, Office Asshole.
- That's Mr. Office Asshole to you.

413
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:47,628
Tequila?

414
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:51,846
Beer, 3 martinis, and tequila?
No, I don't think so.

415
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:53,892
Coward.

416
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:02,806
Bring it on.

417
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:05,024
You've got the moves.

418
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:07,503
That's Soul Train for you, baby.

419
00:31:07,505 --> 00:31:09,503
- What you got?
- Wanna see what I got?

420
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:12,201
- Let's go, let's go.
- Bring it.

421
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,722
You got some moves. Okay, temp.

422
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:18,810
- Nasty, nasty.
- Hey.

423
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:21,332
You know,
I wasn't gonna come tonight.

424
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,247
Why not?

425
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:27,030
I haven't been here that long and...

426
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:30,988
I'm sure everybody here is happy
that you showed up.

427
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,901
Even you?

428
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:37,946
What do you mean, "even me"?
I'm your biggest supporter here.

429
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:48,035
You wanna put one on the cheek?

430
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,995
If you don't, people will
really think something's going on.

431
00:31:56,734 --> 00:32:00,430
Well, we're gonna have
to take that chance then, huh?

432
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:04,778
Whoa, where you going?

433
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:08,388
This evening's just getting started.
Sally Sloane. We got Sally Sloane.

434
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:10,432
You remember her?
She gave us lap dances!

435
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,215
- Sally.
- Derek has singles!

436
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:15,128
- He has singles!
- I gotta go home, sober up.

437
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,302
You wanna get out of here and go
find yourself some new trouble?

438
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:20,738
- No, thank you. No, thank you.
- Where is your holiday spirit?

439
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,652
With my wife and kid.

440
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:26,350
Gotta take a leak, then I'm sneaking
out of here, all right?

441
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:29,785
You're no fun, D. No fun at all.

442
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,309
Lisa, Lisa.

443
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,440
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop.

444
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:46,398
Come on, stop, no.

445
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:52,399
Fuck.

446
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:01,880
You need to stop it.

447
00:33:05,143 --> 00:33:07,447
Who's there?

448
00:33:08,448 --> 00:33:12,143
Stop. Okay. Okay.

449
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:16,605
Lisa, Lisa.

450
00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:21,128
Oh, God, Lisa, Lisa. Stop. Stop.
Don't do that. Don't...

451
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,913
Stop, stop.

452
00:33:36,654 --> 00:33:39,089
Lisa, stop.

453
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:41,959
Stop.

454
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:50,830
Stop.

455
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:52,831
Stop it.

456
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:57,528
- What? Derek.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

457
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:01,008
What's wrong? Derek!

458
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:12,270
If you don't feel like you can drive,
I have cab vouchers.

459
00:34:12,272 --> 00:34:15,532
Cab vouchers for anybody
who can't drive. Don't want you hurt.

460
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,925
Come on, don't be shy.

461
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,797
Freak.

462
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:35,146
Well, well, well.
Living dangerously, aren't we?

463
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:37,930
Patrick, you silly old queen.

464
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,409
Dance with me.

465
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:43,801
Dance with me.

466
00:36:05,518 --> 00:36:07,822
How was it?

467
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,823
The usual, baby.

468
00:36:11,955 --> 00:36:14,650
Anything interesting happen?

469
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:18,912
No.

470
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,047
Good morning.

471
00:36:39,048 --> 00:36:41,048
Hey. Morning.

472
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:44,161
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

473
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:46,640
Man, you should've stayed.

474
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:49,771
Roger from Acquisitions tossed
his cookies on the Christmas tree.

475
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,641
Sorry I missed that.

476
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:02,688
Bad time?

477
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:06,210
No.

478
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:09,820
Joe wants to know when you'll
be done with the Ganz portfolio.

479
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:14,297
Tell him I'll have it to him
by the end of the day.

480
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:15,916
Thanks.

481
00:37:17,706 --> 00:37:18,427
Sure.

482
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:28,051
Joe really likes the ladies, huh?

483
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:32,766
I- I wouldn't know.

484
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:51,161
Hey. All right if I take off?

485
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:54,204
- Yeah. Go home.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

486
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,075
Okay.

487
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:57,945
Hey, Lisa.

488
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,000
Hey.

489
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:44,566
I owe you an apology
for the Christmas party.

490
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:49,088
I think that I sort of took you
by surprise.

491
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:54,046
Yeah, you know,
we both had a few drinks.

492
00:38:54,047 --> 00:38:56,090
So let's just forget about it.

493
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,396
What if I can't?

494
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:10,485
Lisa, nothing happened.

495
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:16,791
All right, have it your way.
Nothing happened.

496
00:39:19,575 --> 00:39:21,489
All right, get out of my car.

497
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,141
Get out of my car right now.

498
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:27,751
Get out of my car.

499
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:29,402
Relax.

500
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:32,274
- Derek, relax.
- Come on. Out of my car.

501
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,101
- Get out of here.
- No one's around to see us.

502
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,406
God. I almost went insane today.
Having to pretend...

503
00:39:39,407 --> 00:39:42,667
like I was concentrating on work,
when all I could think about-

504
00:39:42,668 --> 00:39:45,494
Lisa! Get out of my car now!

505
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:48,191
Derek, what's wrong?

506
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:50,886
- What did I do?
- Hey, hey.

507
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,757
I don't know what's wrong,
whether you're dense or what...

508
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,105
but let me tell you something.
There's nothing going on between us.

509
00:39:57,106 --> 00:40:00,846
Nothing! Okay? I wouldn't jeopardise
my job. For chrissakes, I work here.

510
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:03,238
Stop! Don't touch me. Just get out.

511
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:07,004
Get out.

512
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:11,570
- Get out! Come on!
- God!

513
00:40:11,571 --> 00:40:15,484
- Maybe you are an asshole.
- Yeah, all right. Get out.

514
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:50,450
Sharon?

515
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,102
Shar?

516
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:58,190
Something I need to tell you.

517
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:05,540
What's wrong?

518
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,889
I spent the last hour and a half
talking my sister off the ledge.

519
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,063
- Sheila?
- Can you believe Tim's been having...

520
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:15,239
an affair with some random woman
at work for a year and a half?

521
00:41:15,457 --> 00:41:18,804
- How did she find out?
- Tim just blurted it out.

522
00:41:18,805 --> 00:41:22,283
He said he was leaving her.
With 3 kids.

523
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:25,762
- Yeah, that's tough.
- It's a disaster. If it were me-

524
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:29,198
No, that would never be you,
because I would never cheat on you.

525
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,242
I know.

526
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,461
Tim is an asshole.

527
00:41:35,498 --> 00:41:37,767
Tell me about it.

528
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,767
So, what were you gonna tell me?

529
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,289
What?

530
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,116
You said you had something
to tell me. What is it?

531
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:51,465
No.

532
00:41:52,204 --> 00:41:56,423
Just a problem at work.
Nothing I can't handle.

533
00:41:57,901 --> 00:42:00,466
Why didn't you tell me?

534
00:42:00,858 --> 00:42:03,033
Honestly, there was nothing to tell.

535
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:06,339
She grabbed your package,
flashed you in your car.

536
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,339
Come on.
I thought we were best friends.

537
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,774
I cannot believe
you didn't tell me sooner.

538
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:13,340
- Ben, you think this is funny?
- Yes, I do.

539
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:16,732
I kind of thought maybe she was
into you a little. I just never figured-

540
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:19,645
I don't get it. You know, I...

541
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:21,602
Honestly, Ben.

542
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:24,647
" Hey, how are you?" I didn't-
I was just being nice.

543
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:26,604
That's all.

544
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:29,126
You sure you didn't lead her on?
Just a little?

545
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:33,259
- No. Not a goddamn thing. Honestly.
- That girl is hot.

546
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:37,130
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Report it to Human Resources.

547
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,086
You're gonna get her fired?

548
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,869
- I don't have a choice.
- Let's just be careful about this.

549
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,304
What if she says
that you came onto her?

550
00:42:45,305 --> 00:42:46,566
No way.

551
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,262
We're talking history
of behaviour here, Derek.

552
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:52,567
When's the last time you had
a female assistant at your desk, huh?

553
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:54,264
People are gonna wonder.

554
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:08,136
- Morning, Mr. Charles.
- Hey.

555
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:09,702
- Hank back there?
- Go right in.

556
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:12,355
- Hey, Hank.
- Derek, hey.

557
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,225
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

558
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:23,792
I have... I have a personal matter
I gotta talk to you about.

559
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:25,793
You know Lisa Sheridan, the temp?

560
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:28,576
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She worked your desk for a while.

561
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:31,750
Yeah, that's right. She did.

562
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:35,622
Hank, this is awkward, okay?

563
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:38,492
If you're here to file a complaint
about her performance...

564
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:39,971
you can save your breath.

565
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:42,580
Her agency called,
said she's not coming back in.

566
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:44,711
They already sent a replacement.

567
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:48,086
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

568
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,738
They say why?

569
00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:54,783
No.

570
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,000
Why, was there some sort
of problem?

571
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:00,523
Problem?

572
00:44:00,524 --> 00:44:05,047
No. No problem. No problem.

573
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,221
I just thought she was way in
over her head, that's all.

574
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:14,831
- But if she already quit, then...
- She beat you to it.

575
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:16,484
Yeah.

576
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:22,572
Yeah.

577
00:44:25,225 --> 00:44:28,095
- Was there anything else?
- No. Guess not.

578
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:30,747
- How's the new house?
- You know, couldn't be better.

579
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:32,487
- Tell Sharon I said hi.
- I will.

580
00:44:32,488 --> 00:44:35,619
Actually, you guys should come by
once we settle down. Come by.

581
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,402
- That sounds great.
- All right.

582
00:44:37,403 --> 00:44:39,751
- See you, Hank.
- Bye-bye.

583
00:44:44,578 --> 00:44:46,622
- So?
- She quit.

584
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:48,057
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

585
00:44:48,058 --> 00:44:49,796
Do you have a horseshoe
up your ass?

586
00:44:49,797 --> 00:44:52,057
You are the luckiest bastard I know.

587
00:44:52,058 --> 00:44:53,319
Looks that way.

588
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,449
Not a bad early Christmas present.

589
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,842
All right.

590
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:24,936
Thank you.

591
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:27,893
Thank you. I'm getting
all these gifts. Look at this.

592
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,373
Friedrich?

593
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:38,200
Hey, it's Derek Charles.

594
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:42,463
Hey. How was your Christmas?

595
00:45:42,985 --> 00:45:47,898
No, mine was great.
I had a great time with my family.

596
00:45:47,899 --> 00:45:51,464
No, I'm in the office working
for you right now.

597
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:53,899
Absolutely. That's what we do.
That's what we do.

598
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,075
Hey, you take a look
at that prospectus for me?

599
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,684
I told you.

600
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:03,728
I told you.

601
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:08,687
<i>Yeah. No, I think we're gonna
have a great New Year.</i>

602
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,906
Baby, it's after 3?

603
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:22,776
That's the last time I'm celebrating out
on New Years.

604
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:28,256
Next year, we'll celebrate at home.
Just you, me, and Kyle.

605
00:46:33,693 --> 00:46:35,866
Aren't you gonna get that?

606
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:38,041
No. It'll wait till the morning.

607
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,477
What if it's Ganz with the approval?

608
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:44,547
It's noon in Munich. Go on, lazy.

609
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:56,549
Ganz?

610
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,115
No.

611
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,642
What was that?

612
00:47:18,643 --> 00:47:23,513
Nothing. I just gotta get a
new spam blocker.

613
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:12,569
And then Joe was like:

614
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:16,831
"Oh, we're not drinking. This is a
retreat. We're gonna stay sober.

615
00:48:16,832 --> 00:48:18,700
Do some bonding. "

616
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:21,701
If Joe said that, he must've
been drunk at the time.

617
00:48:21,702 --> 00:48:24,963
Right? So I'll call you later
and check on you and Kyle.

618
00:48:24,964 --> 00:48:26,529
Okay.

619
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:34,791
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lap dance. Lap
dance. Who brought up lap dance?

620
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:38,488
This is- This is a business retreat.
This is work.

621
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:41,533
We are clocked in.
Unless it was Joe's idea.

622
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:44,142
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
so it must've been mine.

623
00:48:44,143 --> 00:48:47,142
All righty. Well, then,
let's see a show of hands...

624
00:48:47,143 --> 00:48:50,796
of who wants to see
some hot, oily breasts...

625
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:53,796
being jammed into their faces?
Derek, are you in?

626
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,231
I'm a married man.

627
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,319
- I don't have to pay for it.
- You're paying.

628
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,319
- You just don't know it yet.
- Hear, hear.

629
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,928
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's this?

630
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:03,190
A dirty martini.

631
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:06,843
- No, I didn't...
- It's from the lady at the bar.

632
00:49:07,452 --> 00:49:11,106
<i>I do have to say I'm kind of a fan
of the waitress staff around here.</i>

633
00:49:11,142 --> 00:49:12,395
<i>We should hit one of those clubs.</i>

634
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:14,521
Derek, are you okay?

635
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:17,526
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought
I saw somebody I know.

636
00:49:17,742 --> 00:49:21,193
Somebody you know,
or somebody you'd like to know?

637
00:49:21,412 --> 00:49:22,657
He can't be tempted.

638
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,532
Can't blame him.
Too scared of Sharon.

639
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:28,829
Speaking of Sharon, I said
I'd call her. I'll be right back.

640
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,049
Hey. Hey, babe.

641
00:49:34,258 --> 00:49:36,547
<i>How's the male bonding?</i>

642
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,049
As you can guess, everybody's wasted.

643
00:49:40,056 --> 00:49:43,472
In about half an hour, I'll be able...

644
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,054
<i>Derek, are you there?</i>

645
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,141
<i>Wait, I think Kyle wants
to say good night.</i>

646
00:49:49,357 --> 00:49:51,396
<i>Derek, are you still there?</i>

647
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:54,563
- Babe, I gotta call you right back.
- It'll just take a second.

648
00:49:54,779 --> 00:49:57,649
- Say good night to Daddy.
- They're calling for me to come back.

649
00:49:57,865 --> 00:50:00,901
- Honey, I'm gonna call you right back.
- Derek?

650
00:50:01,952 --> 00:50:02,983
Derek?

651
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:04,401
Was that Sharon?

652
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:07,077
I can always tell from
the pained look on your face...

653
00:50:07,291 --> 00:50:09,248
when you've been talking to her.

654
00:50:10,628 --> 00:50:12,253
How did you know I'd be here?

655
00:50:12,463 --> 00:50:14,919
What's wrong? You don't look happy
to see me.

656
00:50:15,132 --> 00:50:17,421
I'm not happy to see you.

657
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:18,714
What are you doing here?

658
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:21,549
You said that you would
never jeopardise your job.

659
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:26,007
That's why I quit,
so that we could be together.

660
00:50:26,226 --> 00:50:27,804
You misunderstood me.

661
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:33,358
I'm married, happily married.
There will never be us...

662
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:35,808
together, ever.

663
00:50:36,027 --> 00:50:39,230
You're worried what Joe and Ben
might think.

664
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:40,942
I'll tell you what they'll think.

665
00:50:41,158 --> 00:50:43,945
They'll think that we arranged it
and we did.

666
00:50:45,371 --> 00:50:47,031
What are you talking about?

667
00:50:48,582 --> 00:50:50,290
I see what you're doing.

668
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:54,332
One of us has to take charge,
and I guess that's gonna be me.

669
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:59,338
So you go back and you say your
good nights to the boys, and...

670
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:01,294
I'll be waiting in my room, 610.

671
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:02,791
I'm not coming to your room.

672
00:51:03,012 --> 00:51:05,800
- You want me to come to yours?
- You're sick.

673
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:09,142
- You need help.
- I know.

674
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:11,807
Help me, Derek.

675
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:14,433
You stay away from me.

676
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:20,601
- Sharon?
- Sharon?

677
00:51:20,822 --> 00:51:23,194
It's Ben.
Dude, you done for the night?

678
00:51:23,408 --> 00:51:25,946
No. I'm coming back.

679
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:31,498
Hey, come on, D, it's early.

680
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:34,281
Let's hit my room, plunder the minibar,
charge it to Joe.

681
00:51:34,502 --> 00:51:39,792
No, I, I can't. That last drink
totally kicked my ass, man.

682
00:51:40,007 --> 00:51:43,673
All right, drunky. Don't forget,
9 a. m. tomorrow, Tiffany Room.

683
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:46,093
Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.

684
00:51:46,306 --> 00:51:48,927
Yeah, 9 a. m.

685
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:51,016
Lightweight.

686
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,347
Out.

687
00:52:34,937 --> 00:52:36,182
Baby.

688
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:40,566
No.

689
00:52:46,657 --> 00:52:49,113
Does that feel good?

690
00:52:49,326 --> 00:52:50,986
No.

691
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,922
Hush, baby.

692
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:20,017
No, please, stop.

693
00:53:28,323 --> 00:53:30,197
Does that feel good?

694
00:53:46,216 --> 00:53:47,960
Housekeeping.

695
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:50,050
- Sharon?
- Oh, sorry.

696
00:53:53,223 --> 00:53:55,381
Oh, God.

697
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,065
Oh, shit.

698
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:09,438
Of course,
we here at Gage Bendix...

699
00:54:09,655 --> 00:54:11,980
have a couple advantages
over the competition...

700
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:15,450
not the least of which is the fact
that we are privately held.

701
00:54:15,662 --> 00:54:19,446
We don't worry about the transparency
required of public companies.

702
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:22,335
Thank God, I was thinking
of sending out a search party.

703
00:54:22,544 --> 00:54:24,999
I'm sorry. I overslept.

704
00:54:25,213 --> 00:54:26,624
You overslept.

705
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:29,413
The second great advantage
is that most of our clients...

706
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:31,922
are high-net-worth individuals
more concerned...

707
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:36,679
with preservation of capital than in
outsized gains in any single year...

708
00:54:36,891 --> 00:54:38,599
You all know
how to read a bar chart.

709
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:41,929
What is important here
is putting your clients at ease.

710
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:45,313
One of the things I suggest
going forward in this difficult time...

711
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:48,194
the credit crunch,
whatever you want to call it...

712
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:50,691
is that they understand
that America is on sale.

713
00:54:50,905 --> 00:54:53,028
Excuse me, sir, your wife is here.

714
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,159
- It's Sharon.
- What about her?

715
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:00,616
She's here.

716
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:01,862
Excuse me, Joe.

717
00:55:04,626 --> 00:55:08,671
At any rate, I want to make sure that
you can go with confidence and say...

718
00:55:24,939 --> 00:55:27,015
Here's your wife, sir.

719
00:55:28,442 --> 00:55:31,312
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you woke up. I went to the spa.

720
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,691
What are you doing?

721
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:34,690
I thought you'd need an excuse
to get out of there.

722
00:55:34,906 --> 00:55:36,401
- You wanna get some lunch?
- Lunch?

723
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:39,072
Yeah, it's gorgeous outside.
I made a reservation-

724
00:55:39,286 --> 00:55:40,994
Hey.

725
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,078
What do you think this is?

726
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,200
The morning after.

727
00:55:45,918 --> 00:55:47,661
We didn't do anything last night.

728
00:55:48,963 --> 00:55:50,540
You don't remember?

729
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:53,757
- Last night was perfect.
- Nothing happened!

730
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:56,754
Baby, not so loud.
It'll cause a scene.

731
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,215
A scene?

732
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,755
Right. That's exactly what we need.

733
00:56:00,974 --> 00:56:03,299
- What are you doing?
- I wanna give you a scene.

734
00:56:03,518 --> 00:56:06,602
I'll take you into Joe and the rest
so you can tell them all that-

735
00:56:06,813 --> 00:56:08,936
- Why ruin this?
- There is no "this. "

736
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:10,726
Don't say that.

737
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:12,519
Goddamn it, come here.

738
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:19,867
What's wrong with you?

739
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:22,988
Why are you acting like a stranger?

740
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:27,451
That is exactly what I am to you, a
stranger, somebody you do not know.

741
00:56:28,168 --> 00:56:29,745
Now either you go in there...

742
00:56:29,961 --> 00:56:33,128
and you tell them your lies,
or you leave me the hell alone.

743
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:37,964
Don't you put this all on me, Derek.

744
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:41,297
We both knew what we were getting
into from the very beginning.

745
00:56:41,514 --> 00:56:42,593
What?

746
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:44,550
The first time we met in the elevator.

747
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:46,931
Our dirty martini.

748
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:49,720
The Christmas party.

749
00:56:50,357 --> 00:56:53,808
You said that you wished you were
single so that we could be together.

750
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:55,307
No. No, I did not.

751
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:57,272
- You did! You said it!
- No! I did not!

752
00:56:57,986 --> 00:56:59,245
Derek, you said it.

753
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:00,456
You said it.

754
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,140
If I go in that room and tell them,
it'll be the truth.

755
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:12,556
Is that what you want?

756
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:16,391
You want me to tell them the truth?

757
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:21,895
Ready when you are.

758
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:24,357
Hey, hey.

759
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:26,321
Listen to me!

760
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:29,578
What are you doing?

761
00:57:29,788 --> 00:57:33,572
Hit me. You can do
anything you want to me.

762
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:37,741
You know what?

763
00:57:38,296 --> 00:57:42,246
It doesn't matter what you do or what
you say or what goes on in that brain...

764
00:57:42,467 --> 00:57:46,416
because there's never gonna be
anything between us, never.

765
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:47,919
Okay, Lisa?

766
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,800
Derek.

767
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,772
Derek?

768
00:57:59,401 --> 00:58:00,978
Derek?

769
00:58:12,205 --> 00:58:13,699
I realise we went a little long.

770
00:58:13,914 --> 00:58:17,081
I thought some of the questions you
raised were worth going over...

771
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,120
and I apologise for the length of it.

772
00:58:19,337 --> 00:58:23,086
Those of you with tee times, and I
have one myself, we will still make...

773
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,091
Everything okay?

774
00:58:37,355 --> 00:58:39,394
- Top you off.
- Thank you.

775
00:58:40,524 --> 00:58:42,316
- D?
- Oh, no, no, thanks.

776
00:58:42,526 --> 00:58:43,771
You're not drinking?

777
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:47,152
No, not this evening, man.
I'm sticking to the iced tea.

778
00:58:49,701 --> 00:58:51,159
That's a first.

779
00:58:53,204 --> 00:58:55,113
- You feeling all right?
- Yeah.

780
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:56,915
He's just growing up.

781
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:59,535
Man.

782
00:59:16,893 --> 00:59:21,271
No goddamn way. Come on.
No. Hey. Hey, get up.

783
00:59:22,024 --> 00:59:24,017
Hey. Lisa.

784
00:59:24,235 --> 00:59:26,393
Come on, get up, get up.
You can't stay here.

785
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:29,185
Come on. I'll drag you out of here.
Let's-

786
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,534
No. No, no, no.

787
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:43,001
I need a paramedic up here at 583.
I have a woman in the room.

788
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,880
I think she's overdosed on some sort
of prescription pills.

789
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:47,713
Yeah, yeah. Hurry! Now, please!

790
00:59:47,924 --> 00:59:49,467
Okay.

791
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,879
Breathe. Breathe.

792
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:55,296
Bitch, breathe.

793
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:06,234
- Derek. What's going on?
- I'll call you.

794
01:00:24,211 --> 01:00:25,206
Hello?

795
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,080
Hi, Ben. It's Sharon.

796
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:29,040
Hi, Sharon, hi.

797
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:30,917
I'm sorry to disturb you.

798
01:00:31,134 --> 01:00:34,004
I was trying to reach Derek,
and he usually calls me by now.

799
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,094
I can't reach him on his cell phone.

800
01:00:36,306 --> 01:00:38,512
I was hoping he might be with you?

801
01:00:42,645 --> 01:00:46,595
Yeah, there- There was
a kind of incident.

802
01:00:46,816 --> 01:00:48,358
Is he all right?

803
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,399
Ben?

804
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:55,780
I think he should tell you himself.

805
01:00:57,076 --> 01:01:00,362
Ben, you're scaring me now.
Where is he?

806
01:01:06,252 --> 01:01:07,960
Excuse me. Is she okay?

807
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,744
The doctors are still working on her.

808
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:16,295
Derek. Oh, my God. I've been worried
out of my mind. Are you okay?

809
01:01:16,512 --> 01:01:19,797
What are you doing here? It's okay,
it's okay. I'm good, I'm good.

810
01:01:20,015 --> 01:01:21,759
- Where's Kyle?
- Julie is watching him.

811
01:01:21,976 --> 01:01:23,091
- What happened?
- Sharon.

812
01:01:23,311 --> 01:01:25,054
Mr. Charles. How you doing?

813
01:01:25,271 --> 01:01:27,976
My name is Monica Reese.
I'm the investigating detective.

814
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,563
- Detective?
- Yeah. This is my wife, Sharon.

815
01:01:30,776 --> 01:01:33,314
- She just got here.
- So you haven't told her?

816
01:01:33,529 --> 01:01:35,652
- What?
- Would you prefer to talk in private?

817
01:01:35,865 --> 01:01:40,325
- In private? What's happening, Derek?
- It's okay. Please, we can talk.

818
01:01:40,536 --> 01:01:43,869
I've gone over the initial statement
you gave to the police on the scene.

819
01:01:44,081 --> 01:01:46,406
I just need to clarify a few things,
okay?

820
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:48,167
Let's sit down.

821
01:01:52,215 --> 01:01:57,125
Detective Reese, 0300 hours,
January 15th.

822
01:01:59,221 --> 01:02:02,507
This young woman, Lisa Sheridan,
she works in your office?

823
01:02:02,725 --> 01:02:04,682
Lisa the temp?
What happened to her?

824
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:06,304
Yeah, she tried to hurt herself.

825
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,347
Why? What? Well, what did she do?

826
01:02:08,563 --> 01:02:10,521
Mrs. Charles, I'm sorry.

827
01:02:10,732 --> 01:02:13,437
I need to get the story
in your husband's own words.

828
01:02:13,652 --> 01:02:14,766
Apparently, so do I.

829
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:18,194
Mr. Charles, this Lisa Sheridan-

830
01:02:18,406 --> 01:02:20,778
Yeah, she worked with us
2 weeks.

831
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:23,032
What, you've only known her
for 2 weeks?

832
01:02:23,245 --> 01:02:24,324
Approximately 2 weeks.

833
01:02:24,538 --> 01:02:27,871
Long enough for her to fantasize
that you two were having an affair?

834
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:30,752
- What?
- No. No.

835
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:33,962
She came on to me
at the Christmas party...

836
01:02:34,172 --> 01:02:38,466
and then in the parking garage.

837
01:02:38,677 --> 01:02:40,550
And then she showed up
at the retreat...

838
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:42,970
at my hotel, and I rejected her.

839
01:02:43,181 --> 01:02:46,217
And when- Excuse me.
And when you rejected her...

840
01:02:46,434 --> 01:02:49,969
she tried to commit suicide, naked,
in your bed, in your hotel room.

841
01:02:50,188 --> 01:02:53,937
Wait, wait, wait. She was naked
in your bed, Derek?

842
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:56,642
- Mrs. Charles.
- She was naked in your hotel room?

843
01:02:56,862 --> 01:02:57,893
Please.

844
01:02:58,113 --> 01:03:00,818
- Would you say this affair was-
- There was no affair.

845
01:03:01,032 --> 01:03:02,526
There was no affair.

846
01:03:02,742 --> 01:03:05,909
You're saying she made the thing up
in her head with no help from you?

847
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:07,912
That is exactly what I'm saying.

848
01:03:08,122 --> 01:03:10,245
Why do you think she'd pick you?

849
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:14,408
I don't know. Maybe I said something
that she took the wrong way.

850
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:16,337
- Baby, come on.
- Like what? Like what?

851
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:19,382
What exactly did you say
that she took the wrong way, Derek?

852
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:23,092
- I'm gonna have to ask you to le-
- No, no, she's not going anywhere.

853
01:03:23,305 --> 01:03:26,804
I didn't say anything to her.
I did not lead her on.

854
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:28,808
You had no idea she'd be
at the hotel?

855
01:03:29,018 --> 01:03:30,596
I don't know how she got
in my room.

856
01:03:30,812 --> 01:03:34,596
She told the hotel clerk she was your
wife and she wanted to surprise you.

857
01:03:34,816 --> 01:03:36,808
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Stop, Sharon.

858
01:03:37,026 --> 01:03:40,062
- Did you have sex with her?
- No, I did not...

859
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:41,773
have sex with her.

860
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,277
Sharon, come on. I need for you and I
not to fall apart right now.

861
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,782
- Mr. Charles. Please.
- Hold on.

862
01:03:50,164 --> 01:03:53,450
Just stay here.
Please just stay here.

863
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:01,045
Look, I don't care if you're doing
this girl or not.

864
01:04:01,259 --> 01:04:04,176
I'm not doing this girl, okay?
Never have.

865
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:06,296
- Okay.
- Okay.

866
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:09,130
Detective?

867
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,556
It's the doctor. I'll be right back.

868
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:13,968
Sharon.

869
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:16,809
I swear to God
this is just a misunderstanding.

870
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:18,304
A misunderstanding.

871
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:22,392
A girl tries to kill herself because of
you, it's just a misunderstanding?

872
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:24,107
You think I'm gonna believe that?

873
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:26,316
- Do you believe me?
- No, I don't believe you!

874
01:04:26,534 --> 01:04:29,203
- You didn't even call your son back-
- Sharon, listen.

875
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:31,570
Seems they pumped her out in time.

876
01:04:31,789 --> 01:04:34,161
Probably tomorrow they'll take her
out of the ICU...

877
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:37,909
and take her up to the 5th floor
for psychiatric evaluation.

878
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:40,500
That's great news. Okay, thank you.

879
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:44,664
She was lucid enough to give a name
to the doctor in case of emergencies.

880
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,469
You still wanna stick to your story?

881
01:05:51,617 --> 01:05:54,190
Sharon. Sharon,
you gonna talk to me?

882
01:05:54,411 --> 01:05:57,117
Thanks, Julie. I'll call you tomorrow.

883
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:58,577
Sharon, is everything okay?

884
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:00,950
Julie. Hey, thank you.

885
01:06:01,169 --> 01:06:02,711
Sharon.

886
01:06:05,423 --> 01:06:06,798
Sharon.

887
01:06:07,508 --> 01:06:09,300
Hey.

888
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:10,921
Sharon.

889
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:13,424
Can we talk?

890
01:06:14,682 --> 01:06:17,599
Sharon, I just- Now listen,
Sharon, all I wanna do-

891
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:20,764
What, what, what, Derek? What?
What do you want?

892
01:06:20,979 --> 01:06:23,102
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Now you wanna talk.

893
01:06:23,315 --> 01:06:26,270
- Sharon, you know me.
- No, I don't know you.

894
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:29,273
I don't know you. I know the Derek
that told me everything.

895
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:32,110
- Oh, come on.
- But you? I have no idea who you are.

896
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:33,320
Sharon, I was wrong.

897
01:06:33,534 --> 01:06:35,990
If I hadn't gone to the ER,
if I hadn't called Ben...

898
01:06:36,203 --> 01:06:37,781
would you have even told me?

899
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:39,954
What are you, crazy?
Of course I would have.

900
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:42,324
Like you told me about
the Christmas party, huh?

901
01:06:42,543 --> 01:06:44,120
Or what about the parking garage?

902
01:06:44,336 --> 01:06:47,787
Yes, you told me about you being
in a parking garage with this woman.

903
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:49,666
What else haven't you told me,
Derek?

904
01:06:49,883 --> 01:06:51,959
All I'm hearing
are things you haven't told me.

905
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:54,668
I was wrong. I should've told you
the truth from the-

906
01:06:54,888 --> 01:06:56,549
You should have! Why didn't you?

907
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:59,601
Because I didn't think
it was a big deal in the first place...

908
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:01,139
...and then I was embarrassed.

909
01:07:01,353 --> 01:07:05,303
- How do I say it without looking-?
- Guilty? Guilty?

910
01:07:05,524 --> 01:07:09,735
I'm your wife, Derek. You're supposed
to trust me. You let this happen.

911
01:07:10,821 --> 01:07:12,066
You think I encouraged this?

912
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:16,527
Don't give me that innocent bullshit.
I was there at your desk. I saw you.

913
01:07:16,743 --> 01:07:19,412
I saw how you played games
and you played those girls...

914
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:22,622
but you never did that to me.
Until now.

915
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:26,867
What is this? Is this about me
wanting to go to school?

916
01:07:27,087 --> 01:07:28,665
God, Sharon, it is not like that.

917
01:07:28,881 --> 01:07:31,372
This woman is sick, okay?
Nothing happened between-

918
01:07:31,592 --> 01:07:34,343
Do I ever ask you for anything?
I don't ask you for anything.

919
01:07:34,553 --> 01:07:36,130
All I asked you was to be honest.

920
01:07:36,346 --> 01:07:37,591
- I told you the truth!
- No.

921
01:07:37,806 --> 01:07:39,181
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

922
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:43,720
- I told you the truth.
- No, you didn't. You lied.

923
01:07:43,937 --> 01:07:46,095
We made a vow
on our wedding day...

924
01:07:46,314 --> 01:07:48,852
that we would tell each other
everything.

925
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,686
No matter how ugly
or uncomfortable it might be.

926
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:58,276
I specifically asked you,
"Did anything happen at that party?"

927
01:07:58,493 --> 01:07:59,952
And what did you tell me?

928
01:08:00,162 --> 01:08:01,905
- You said no.
- I know.

929
01:08:02,122 --> 01:08:04,198
- I don't know what to believe right now.
- Okay.

930
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:05,411
Hey, hey, hey.

931
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:08,198
I think I need to be alone.
I think I need to be alone.

932
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,495
Stop, stop, stop. Okay?

933
01:08:10,713 --> 01:08:12,789
Come on. Sharon. Please?

934
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:15,875
- Sharon, come on.
- Get out of my house!

935
01:08:16,094 --> 01:08:19,047
This is crazy, Sharon!
Don't you see what's happening?

936
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:20,888
Get out of my house.

937
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,397
Nothing happened with this...

938
01:08:32,944 --> 01:08:34,568
Okay. You know what?

939
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:38,397
You just tell me what you want me
to do and that's what I'll do!

940
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:41,072
Well, first, I suggest you pack
your toothbrush.

941
01:08:41,285 --> 01:08:44,452
Then I want you to get your socks,
your shaving kit, your underwear...

942
01:08:44,664 --> 01:08:47,071
your prophylactics, if
you need them, and get out!

943
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,414
- And go where, Sharon?
- To hell.

944
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:53,419
But until then,
I suggest maybe the Four Seasons.

945
01:08:58,553 --> 01:09:00,130
Sharon!

946
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,432
Miss Sheridan?

947
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:20,691
Hey, I'm Monica Reese.
I'm a detective assigned to your case.

948
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:22,901
- Come in.
- Thanks.

949
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,027
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

950
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:30,699
They won't let me take a shower
or wash my hair.

951
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:33,670
Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.

952
01:09:35,923 --> 01:09:39,292
So you feel like talking
about the other night?

953
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:41,958
Have you spoken to Derek?

954
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:43,459
Yeah.

955
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:45,556
And he's all right?

956
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:48,055
Relatively speaking.

957
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:49,892
When can I see him?

958
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,808
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

959
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,810
- Why?
- Miss, I don't mean to upset you...

960
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,980
but I don't think Mr. Charles
wants to speak to you...

961
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:02,446
or continue any kind of contact.

962
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:05,276
Then why did he send me these?

963
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:10,496
He sent you flowers?

964
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:14,160
Lilies. My favourite.

965
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,373
Beautiful.

966
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,842
Yeah.

967
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:28,387
Miss Sheridan, could you tell me
what happened at the hotel?

968
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,640
- Why you were there?
- Didn't Derek tell you?

969
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:34,435
Yeah, but I'd really like
to get your version.

970
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:37,598
Well, there's not much to tell.

971
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,694
He asked me to meet him
at the hotel.

972
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,447
And you agreed?

973
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:45,531
Of course.

974
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:47,152
And then what happened?

975
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,615
I think you can guess what we did.

976
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,370
Yeah. You... You slept together.

977
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,863
Yes.

978
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,662
Well, Derek denies it, so...

979
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,873
He's just trying to protect me.

980
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,040
He's being a gentleman.

981
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:05,923
Right.

982
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:11,724
The next day, he told me that his wife
wouldn't give him a divorce.

983
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,141
You know the kind of woman
that will never let go?

984
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,061
Yeah.

985
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,560
Then he said
that we couldn't see each other.

986
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,233
I overreacted.

987
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:25,147
I didn't realise at the time
that he was just being noble.

988
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,902
Noble? What do you mean, "noble"?

989
01:11:29,117 --> 01:11:32,452
He was thinking about his little boy,
Kyle.

990
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,739
What the break-up would do to him.

991
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,366
Lisa. Can I call you Lisa?

992
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,540
Yeah.

993
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:43,914
How would you, you know...

994
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,751
characterise your relationship
with Derek?

995
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,593
- Lovers.
- Yeah, I got that.

996
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:55,099
But I mean, do you really believe
he's in love with you?

997
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,267
I'm not a home wrecker.

998
01:11:59,147 --> 01:12:03,098
Monica, I'm not stealing him away.
Their marriage is over.

999
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:09,692
I do feel bad about his wife, though.

1000
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,569
Well, how so?

1001
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:13,279
Well, it can't be easy...

1002
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:17,113
to find out that your husband's
in love with someone else.

1003
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:19,123
Right.

1004
01:12:20,168 --> 01:12:22,624
I just hope that she doesn't do
something stupid.

1005
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,795
I don't have to tell you the impact
this could have.

1006
01:12:28,009 --> 01:12:31,130
- Even a whiff of impropriety.
- Impropriety. There is no impropriety!

1007
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:34,217
This is just a sick fantasy
from a very disturbed girl.

1008
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,971
Who might retaliate
with a sexual harassment lawsuit.

1009
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:39,059
I was the one
who was sexually harassed.

1010
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:42,474
I can't believe this is happening
to me. This is like a nightmare.

1011
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,897
By now you're probably wishing
you had banged her.

1012
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,067
Goddamn it, Joe!

1013
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:52,188
Derek, calm down. I believe you,
and I'll back you all the way on this.

1014
01:12:52,408 --> 01:12:54,484
If we find out
there was something going on...

1015
01:12:54,702 --> 01:12:56,778
That's not gonna happen.
There's nothing.

1016
01:12:56,996 --> 01:12:59,997
Good. Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

1017
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:04,374
- I'm putting Ben on the Ganz account.
- No. Ganz is my client-

1018
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:05,583
- Look-
- No, Joe.

1019
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:07,375
I'm not losing my client over this.

1020
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:11,422
Take a little time off, just until
this blows over. Focus on Sharon.

1021
01:13:11,636 --> 01:13:12,964
Oh, Jesus.

1022
01:13:14,305 --> 01:13:15,681
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1023
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,511
Derek, there's a Detective Reese here
to see you.

1024
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:22,510
Come on.
You think I sent her flowers?

1025
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:26,977
My assistant has all my personal
information in his computer.

1026
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:30,522
She must have accessed them
when she temped for me.

1027
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:37,237
This is Lisa's journal.
It's a sort of diary, I guess...

1028
01:13:37,453 --> 01:13:39,245
- that she was keeping.
- Okay.

1029
01:13:39,455 --> 01:13:41,863
It's a rather graphic
and detailed account...

1030
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:45,748
of your various sexual liaisons
together.

1031
01:13:45,962 --> 01:13:48,749
- My what?
- I have to warn you, it's...

1032
01:13:54,428 --> 01:13:55,887
"We... "

1033
01:14:03,187 --> 01:14:04,895
This is bullshit.

1034
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,061
None of this happened.
I've never been to her apartment.

1035
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:09,853
I've never touched her.

1036
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:13,983
Well, according to these entries,
you are quite the accomplished lover.

1037
01:14:14,198 --> 01:14:17,780
Oh, and apparently,
you made some promises to her.

1038
01:14:17,993 --> 01:14:19,653
Promises to divorce your wife and-

1039
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,195
Okay, detective.

1040
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:24,157
You seem smart.

1041
01:14:24,916 --> 01:14:26,494
You can't possibly believe that.

1042
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:30,244
Look, the only thing that matters
is that she believes this.

1043
01:14:30,463 --> 01:14:33,999
So there has to be something I can do
to protect myself, right? My family?

1044
01:14:34,218 --> 01:14:36,626
Sure.
You could file a restraining order.

1045
01:14:36,846 --> 01:14:37,960
Let's do that.

1046
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,137
- But that might not be necessary.
- Why not?

1047
01:14:40,349 --> 01:14:42,756
Because Lisa's sister flew down
from San Francisco...

1048
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:45,847
and took Lisa back with her
earlier today.

1049
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:52,351
I can't say I'm unhappy to hear that.

1050
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:56,191
Maybe now she'll get the help
that she needs.

1051
01:16:41,927 --> 01:16:44,679
You ready? Let's go for it.

1052
01:16:45,514 --> 01:16:49,381
- Hey.
- Kyle. Hey, baby.

1053
01:17:07,328 --> 01:17:09,534
It's my birthday next week.

1054
01:17:10,956 --> 01:17:12,498
Happy birthday.

1055
01:17:15,144 --> 01:17:17,804
Sharon, are you gonna make me
spend my birthday alone?

1056
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:25,831
Have dinner with me?

1057
01:17:28,588 --> 01:17:30,248
Come on, Sharon.

1058
01:17:32,842 --> 01:17:34,751
Move your foot, Derek.

1059
01:18:05,124 --> 01:18:06,370
What do you think?

1060
01:18:07,669 --> 01:18:08,949
Be honest.

1061
01:18:14,509 --> 01:18:16,881
Derek, your menu. Your menu.

1062
01:18:17,094 --> 01:18:19,668
- Oh, my menu, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1063
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:27,053
Sharon, this means a lot to me.

1064
01:18:28,856 --> 01:18:30,018
I missed you.

1065
01:18:30,232 --> 01:18:33,932
And, I don't know, there's just so much
I wanna tell you.

1066
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:36,401
It's your party, birthday boy.

1067
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:43,150
You look beautiful.

1068
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:46,241
I love you.

1069
01:18:47,875 --> 01:18:49,951
Sharon, I just wanna be home.

1070
01:18:50,461 --> 01:18:52,121
Okay, it's been 3 months.

1071
01:18:52,337 --> 01:18:57,580
And I'll do whatever it takes to fix this,
to make us work again...

1072
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:00,885
your studies, you and Kyle,
I mean...

1073
01:19:01,096 --> 01:19:03,587
you name it, I'll do it.

1074
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:14,018
I got you something.

1075
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,528
- Should I just-?
- No.

1076
01:19:19,906 --> 01:19:22,480
Let's see how
the rest of the evening goes.

1077
01:19:23,535 --> 01:19:26,322
And welcome to "Fact or Fiction. "

1078
01:19:26,538 --> 01:19:29,111
I'm your host, Rod Baker.

1079
01:19:29,415 --> 01:19:34,161
And on today's show, let's welcome
back our champion, Bunny!

1080
01:19:50,311 --> 01:19:52,553
Hi. I'm Sharon's friend, Kate.

1081
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:54,471
You're...?

1082
01:19:55,066 --> 01:19:58,102
Samantha. Mrs. Charles is at dinner.

1083
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:01,106
Sharon told me to drop by.
I have this present for Kyle.

1084
01:20:01,322 --> 01:20:02,733
I'm just gonna run it up to him.

1085
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:04,407
Oh, you can't, he's sleeping.

1086
01:20:04,617 --> 01:20:05,613
I won't wake him.

1087
01:20:05,826 --> 01:20:07,654
Maybe you should come back
another time.

1088
01:20:07,871 --> 01:20:09,531
But I'm here now.

1089
01:20:09,748 --> 01:20:11,290
I...

1090
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,250
I get it, you're just doing your job.
Good.

1091
01:20:15,462 --> 01:20:17,537
Do you need me to call Sharon?

1092
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:19,210
Yeah.

1093
01:20:19,424 --> 01:20:21,250
Okay.

1094
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:31,631
Sharon. Hey, it's Kate.

1095
01:20:32,519 --> 01:20:36,019
Where am I? I'm at your house,
of course. You told me to drop by.

1096
01:20:36,648 --> 01:20:37,680
She forgot.

1097
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:41,233
No, Samantha just wanted me
to give you a call.

1098
01:20:41,446 --> 01:20:42,940
She was a little bit concerned.

1099
01:20:43,156 --> 01:20:47,284
No. No, no, no.
Don't be upset with her.

1100
01:20:47,493 --> 01:20:50,613
No, God, come on,
she was just doing her job.

1101
01:20:51,622 --> 01:20:54,872
Great. All right, have an
amazing dinner. Tell Derek I said hi.

1102
01:20:55,084 --> 01:20:56,494
Oh, Sharon, hold on.

1103
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,169
Do you need to talk to her?

1104
01:20:58,379 --> 01:20:59,956
No, no, I'm fine.

1105
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:03,964
All right, I'll catch up with you
in the morning. Bye, honey.

1106
01:21:05,052 --> 01:21:06,462
I'll be back in a sec.

1107
01:21:07,345 --> 01:21:08,377
Yeah.

1108
01:21:27,032 --> 01:21:31,030
Sharon, you know,
I miss you and I love you...

1109
01:21:31,244 --> 01:21:33,403
and I know that you miss me too.

1110
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:39,666
I do miss you, but I don't know
if that's enough.

1111
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,503
We're not talking about divorce,
right?

1112
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,342
I don't come from a family of divorce.

1113
01:21:51,556 --> 01:21:54,842
Mom and Dad'll be celebrating their
30th anniversary in 3 months.

1114
01:21:55,727 --> 01:21:58,016
I look at them and I wonder
if that can ever be us.

1115
01:21:58,229 --> 01:22:01,515
It is us. It can be us, will be us.

1116
01:22:14,121 --> 01:22:17,240
I need you to understand
that nothing happened with that girl.

1117
01:22:17,457 --> 01:22:22,083
I know I should've been honest
with you from the beginning...

1118
01:22:22,295 --> 01:22:23,955
and I wasn't.

1119
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:27,545
And that will never happen again.

1120
01:22:28,092 --> 01:22:29,717
But I love you.

1121
01:22:29,927 --> 01:22:34,055
I mean, I love you with all my heart,
and I love my son too.

1122
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,188
I guess Kyle does miss his daddy.

1123
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:46,064
Does Sharon... miss Daddy?

1124
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:50,405
I will do anything, anything.

1125
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,566
- Anything?
- You name it.

1126
01:22:56,787 --> 01:22:59,872
Oh, I guess the evening's
going good.

1127
01:23:03,502 --> 01:23:05,293
What about the Benz?

1128
01:23:06,714 --> 01:23:08,836
- The Benz.
- My Benz?

1129
01:23:09,049 --> 01:23:12,419
I just- Oh, yes.
I got that key right here.

1130
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,304
You know, it's...

1131
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:20,925
Missed you.

1132
01:23:36,743 --> 01:23:38,024
See you later!

1133
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:39,573
You too!

1134
01:23:54,845 --> 01:23:56,256
Okay, it works, it works.

1135
01:23:56,471 --> 01:23:58,844
Welcome home, baby.

1136
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:01,089
You driving my car.

1137
01:24:01,309 --> 01:24:04,096
- You guys got back so fast.
- Hey.

1138
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:05,391
Any trouble with Kyle?

1139
01:24:05,605 --> 01:24:08,310
No, he was a doll.
But you just missed your friend.

1140
01:24:08,525 --> 01:24:10,683
- What friend?
- You know, your friend Kate?

1141
01:24:10,902 --> 01:24:11,899
I don't know a Kate.

1142
01:24:12,112 --> 01:24:13,939
She was here.
She had something for Kyle.

1143
01:24:14,156 --> 01:24:15,650
Oh, my God! Where's Kyle?

1144
01:24:15,866 --> 01:24:17,740
- His crib.
- Somebody was inside the house?

1145
01:24:17,951 --> 01:24:19,529
- Yeah.
- How long were they here for?

1146
01:24:19,745 --> 01:24:23,493
Just a few minutes. What's wrong?
You said it was okay!

1147
01:24:23,707 --> 01:24:24,952
Kyle?

1148
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:27,664
She took my baby.

1149
01:24:27,878 --> 01:24:30,000
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1150
01:24:31,506 --> 01:24:32,669
What happened? Tell me.

1151
01:24:32,882 --> 01:24:35,338
She said she had something for Kyle
and then she left.

1152
01:24:35,552 --> 01:24:37,674
She left? Kyle's not in his room!

1153
01:24:37,887 --> 01:24:39,796
Call 911! Now!

1154
01:24:40,807 --> 01:24:42,467
Kyle?

1155
01:24:50,567 --> 01:24:52,643
Kyle?

1156
01:24:52,861 --> 01:24:56,443
Kyle? Son?

1157
01:25:00,076 --> 01:25:01,819
Kyle!

1158
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:10,157
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

1159
01:25:14,215 --> 01:25:15,840
Kyle, oh.

1160
01:25:18,428 --> 01:25:21,927
She couldn't have got far.
She couldn't have got far.

1161
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:36,482
We'll wait for the blood work.
It appears he's fine.

1162
01:25:36,695 --> 01:25:39,020
I don't see any reason
why you can't take him home.

1163
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:41,232
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

1164
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:46,198
Hey.

1165
01:25:46,831 --> 01:25:48,325
How's he doing?

1166
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:50,000
Doctor says he's fine.

1167
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:54,076
Well, I'm not fine.
She was in our house.

1168
01:25:54,296 --> 01:25:56,289
And now our son
is in a hospital bed.

1169
01:25:56,507 --> 01:25:58,914
You said she was in San Francisco.
Why is she back?

1170
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:00,926
And how did she even know
we'd be out?

1171
01:26:01,136 --> 01:26:02,796
Obviously she was watching
your house.

1172
01:26:03,013 --> 01:26:04,424
We need you to find her.

1173
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,798
I will do everything in my power
to find her.

1174
01:26:07,017 --> 01:26:09,424
One of you better do something
about this woman.

1175
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:11,937
Or I will.

1176
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:17,359
So, what am I supposed to do now?

1177
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,064
- Buy a gun?
- Please.

1178
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,904
We'll have our unit tracking her.

1179
01:26:21,115 --> 01:26:23,688
In the meantime, you better beef up
your security system.

1180
01:26:23,909 --> 01:26:26,614
She could have hurt my son.
My son.

1181
01:26:48,225 --> 01:26:50,798
Okay. You don't wanna go to sleep?

1182
01:26:51,019 --> 01:26:52,976
- Kyle. It's okay, baby.
- It's okay.

1183
01:26:54,898 --> 01:26:56,476
Oh, no.

1184
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:59,182
Oh, no. God.

1185
01:27:01,321 --> 01:27:02,898
Jesus.

1186
01:27:03,823 --> 01:27:05,448
This psycho.

1187
01:27:05,658 --> 01:27:06,903
She never left.

1188
01:27:19,214 --> 01:27:22,832
Yeah, I need to speak
to Detective Reese immediately.

1189
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:24,925
My name, Derek Charles.

1190
01:27:25,178 --> 01:27:26,886
Yeah, she knows me.

1191
01:27:27,097 --> 01:27:29,136
This is an emergency.
I need to speak to her.

1192
01:27:29,349 --> 01:27:33,975
Hi, it's Lisa, sorry you missed me.
Leave me a message after the beep.

1193
01:27:35,188 --> 01:27:38,936
You listen to me.
You know exactly who this is.

1194
01:27:39,608 --> 01:27:43,523
You came into my house,
you touched my child...

1195
01:27:44,489 --> 01:27:46,612
and you think you're crazy?

1196
01:27:46,825 --> 01:27:48,200
I'll show you crazy.

1197
01:27:49,577 --> 01:27:50,906
Just try me, bitch!

1198
01:27:55,124 --> 01:27:57,959
You're set. You ready for me
to show you how the system works?

1199
01:27:58,169 --> 01:27:59,877
Definitely.

1200
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,372
Simple.

1201
01:28:04,592 --> 01:28:07,877
You just punch in your code,
now it's armed.

1202
01:28:08,095 --> 01:28:11,630
Case of an emergency,
this is the panic button.

1203
01:28:11,849 --> 01:28:14,636
You touch this,
the police are knocking at your door.

1204
01:28:14,851 --> 01:28:16,810
There's also one in your master.

1205
01:29:36,516 --> 01:29:38,390
Okay, so you packed everything?

1206
01:29:38,601 --> 01:29:39,716
What time you taking off?

1207
01:29:39,936 --> 01:29:43,980
This afternoon after I pick Kyle up
from my sister's.

1208
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:45,814
- Okay, well, drive safely.
- Okay.

1209
01:29:46,025 --> 01:29:47,935
- I'll be there in the morning.
- All right.

1210
01:29:48,153 --> 01:29:50,062
- Set the alarm.
- You don't have to tell me.

1211
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,940
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1212
01:29:53,450 --> 01:29:55,074
Bye.

1213
01:30:03,126 --> 01:30:04,454
Derek Charles's office.

1214
01:30:04,669 --> 01:30:05,831
Patrick.

1215
01:30:06,045 --> 01:30:09,165
Lisa? Oh, my God, it's been forever.

1216
01:30:09,382 --> 01:30:11,090
What, like 6 months?

1217
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,218
I know. We've got a lot of gossip
to catch up on.

1218
01:30:14,428 --> 01:30:18,379
Well, I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I could get fired.

1219
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,806
Trust me, you're not getting fired.

1220
01:30:21,019 --> 01:30:22,098
What do you mean?

1221
01:30:22,312 --> 01:30:24,020
Derek didn't tell you.

1222
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:26,518
Tell me what?

1223
01:30:26,733 --> 01:30:28,855
He's leaving Sharon.
They're getting a divorce.

1224
01:30:29,068 --> 01:30:31,855
- A divorce?
- Like that's a surprise.

1225
01:30:32,071 --> 01:30:34,906
Look, that's not gonna happen, Lisa.

1226
01:30:35,116 --> 01:30:37,404
Patrick, come on.
I know what I'm talking about.

1227
01:30:37,618 --> 01:30:41,662
Then why are they driving to San
Diego for her parents' anniversary?

1228
01:30:41,872 --> 01:30:43,414
Derek's not going.

1229
01:30:43,624 --> 01:30:45,830
Yeah, actually, he is.

1230
01:30:46,043 --> 01:30:49,294
Sharon's leaving this afternoon,
Derek's driving down in the morning.

1231
01:30:51,257 --> 01:30:53,296
Lisa? Did you hear me?

1232
01:30:53,509 --> 01:30:54,540
Patrick, I have to go.

1233
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,041
No, you just called.

1234
01:31:31,588 --> 01:31:32,584
My purse.

1235
01:32:40,615 --> 01:32:43,070
Joe needs these by 5.

1236
01:32:43,284 --> 01:32:45,905
- Yeah. Sharon's on one.
- Okay.

1237
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:51,662
- Hey.
- Hey, baby, I just left the house.

1238
01:32:51,876 --> 01:32:54,498
- Okay, good. You set the alarm?
- The ala-

1239
01:32:54,712 --> 01:32:56,420
Oh, God, I forgot.

1240
01:32:56,631 --> 01:32:59,003
Don't worry. I'm gonna get out soon.
I'll do it.

1241
01:32:59,217 --> 01:33:03,001
No. I'm just down the hill. I'll swing
back around, and I'll call you after.

1242
01:33:03,221 --> 01:33:05,130
Hey. Call me back.

1243
01:35:08,845 --> 01:35:10,505
Did you not get my message?

1244
01:35:10,721 --> 01:35:14,505
I'm so sorry. We didn't want you
to find out this way.

1245
01:35:16,102 --> 01:35:17,726
I knew it would come to this.

1246
01:35:17,937 --> 01:35:23,312
I know how hard it must be to have
someone fall out of love with you.

1247
01:35:23,526 --> 01:35:25,068
I know.

1248
01:35:27,697 --> 01:35:29,903
You are completely delusional.

1249
01:35:30,908 --> 01:35:33,660
I'm gonna have the cops
deal with your crazy ass.

1250
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:36,491
- Wait, it doesn't-
- Don't touch me.

1251
01:35:37,415 --> 01:35:40,830
- We can talk.
- I told you, don't touch me!

1252
01:35:49,635 --> 01:35:51,508
Crazy!

1253
01:35:52,055 --> 01:35:53,217
Get off of me!

1254
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:20,906
You have reached
the Charles Residence.

1255
01:36:21,499 --> 01:36:22,995
Sharon.

1256
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,621
Are you there?

1257
01:36:28,924 --> 01:36:30,418
- Derek.
- Lisa?

1258
01:36:30,634 --> 01:36:33,255
What are you doing in my house?

1259
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:34,964
Sharon.

1260
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:37,555
Sharon?

1261
01:36:38,809 --> 01:36:41,050
Derek, I'm gonna call you back.

1262
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:51,566
I need to speak to Detective
Reese, right now, please.

1263
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:53,820
Yeah. No, it's an emergency.

1264
01:36:55,117 --> 01:36:56,231
Come here, bitch.

1265
01:36:57,786 --> 01:37:00,407
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with your little skinny ass.

1266
01:37:00,622 --> 01:37:03,956
Oh, you want to hold on?
You screaming now, huh?

1267
01:37:11,633 --> 01:37:13,424
Come here!

1268
01:37:13,635 --> 01:37:16,635
Didn't I tell you not
to come to my house?

1269
01:37:16,846 --> 01:37:18,424
Nobody touches my child.

1270
01:37:55,009 --> 01:37:57,168
Come on. Come here!

1271
01:40:14,564 --> 01:40:16,271
Come on, this what you want?

1272
01:40:16,482 --> 01:40:18,439
Come on.

1273
01:40:32,332 --> 01:40:33,707
Come a little closer.

1274
01:40:35,751 --> 01:40:36,996
You almost got it, come on.

1275
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:39,413
Come on.

1276
01:40:47,429 --> 01:40:49,837
You want some of me?
You almost got me.

1277
01:40:54,853 --> 01:40:56,133
Come on, bitch.

1278
01:41:27,386 --> 01:41:29,011
Take my hand.

1279
01:41:29,221 --> 01:41:30,929
Come on, take my hand.

1280
01:41:33,058 --> 01:41:34,221
I got you.

1281
01:41:40,899 --> 01:41:42,559
Come on, come on.

1282
01:41:46,488 --> 01:41:48,030
Crazy bitch.

1283
01:42:05,006 --> 01:42:06,798
Get off of me.

1284
01:42:41,709 --> 01:42:43,251
Oh, God.

1285
01:43:11,739 --> 01:43:13,613
Oh, God.

1286
01:44:02,331 --> 01:44:04,039
Sharon? You all right?

1287
01:44:05,959 --> 01:44:07,074
What happened here?

1288
01:44:07,294 --> 01:44:09,417
I think you know what happened.

1289
01:44:11,465 --> 01:44:13,291
Stay here.

1290
01:44:14,551 --> 01:44:17,172
- Oh, baby.
- You okay?

1291
01:44:18,305 --> 01:44:24,624
