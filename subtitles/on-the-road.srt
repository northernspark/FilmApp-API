3
00:00:28,517 --> 00:00:31,142
(singing)Well, I left New York 1949.

4
00:00:31,183 --> 00:00:35,225
(To)go across the country (wi)thout a dad-blame dime.

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Montana in the cold, cold fall.

6
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:42,642
Found my father in the gambling hall.

7
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:46,767
Father, Father where have you been?

8
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:51,142
Been out here in the world since I was 10.

9
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:56,933
Dear son, he said don't worry about me.

10
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,017
I'm about to die of pleurisy.

11
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:09,267
Cross the Mississippi, cross the Tennessee Cross the Niagara, home I'll never be.

12
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:16,933
Home in Ol'Medora, home in Ol' Truckee Apalachicola, home I'll never be.

13
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:22,767
For better or worse, through thick and thin.

14
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:26,933
Like being married to the little woman.

15
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:32,892
God loved me just like I loved him.

16
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,600
Wants you to do just the same for him.

17
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:42,725
Well, the worms eat away but don't worry, watch thewind.

18
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:46,433
The worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind.

19
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:51,225
So I left Montana in an ol'freight train.

20
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:55,850
The night my father died in the cold, cold rain.

21
00:01:55,891 --> 00:02:03,516
Rode up to Opelousas, rode to Wounded Knee, Rode to Ogallala, home I'll never be.

22
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:11,808
Rode to Oklahoma, rode to El Cajon Rode to Tehachapi, rode to San Antone.

23
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:22,308
Home I'll never be Home I'll never be Home I'll never be.

24
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:36,183
ON THE ROAD

25
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:47,725
Got room for one more?

26
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,016
Yeah, sure, hop in.

27
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:50,141
There's room for everybody.

28
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:53,016
Alright.

29
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,850
Thanks, brother !

30
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,058
Whooooee !

31
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,433
Here we go !

32
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:01,891
Hang on, brother, hang on.

33
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:06,433
Where you guys from?

34
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:07,808
North Dakota.

35
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,183
We're headed for the harvest.

36
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,558
Thanks.

37
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,558
What about you?

38
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:24,058
Montana.

39
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,391
So, you going someplace, or you just going?

40
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,558
I guess I'm just going.

41
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,558
You got any money?

42
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:38,516
I got enough for a pint of whiskey till we reach Denver.

43
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,933
You reckon if we put them things in the ground, something will grow up?

44
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,641
(laughs)If I get hungry enough, I plan to eat them raw !

45
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,600
(laughs)I'll share them with you !

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,225
Aww.

47
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:15,641
(singing) Oh I got a pretty little girl.

48
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:18,766
She's sweet sixteen.

49
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:22,933
She's the prettiest little thing.

50
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:25,058
You ever seen.

51
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,641
I got a pretty little girl.

52
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:33,891
She's sweet sixteen.

53
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:38,433
She's the prettiest little thing.

54
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:40,308
You ever seen.

55
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:54,891
(All join)Oh I got a pretty little girl. She's sweet sixteen. She's the prettiest little thing I ever seen.

56
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:15,141
Five months earlier.

57
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:18,599
Leo Paradise loved many things.

58
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,933
Though part of him never left his native Quebec, when.

59
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:28,058
he moved to this country with his dear wife Gabrielle, heloved it with all his heart.

60
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:36,016
Now, he joins his departed son Gerard in a better place.

61
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,058
Are you all right?

62
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:39,262
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

63
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:40,691
I'm all right.

64
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,224
I'm good.

65
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,433
I first met Dean not long after my father died.

66
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,503
I'd just gotten over a serious illness that I won't bother to talk about

67
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,934
except that it really had something to do with my father's death,

68
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,846
and my awful feeling that everything was dead.

69
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:40,599
"Let's go for a drink", says my buddy Sal.

70
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:44,349
But I show up and guess what — no Sal Paradise.

71
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:49,016
A boring, brooding mute has been inserted in his place.

72
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:50,183
Oh really, Carlo.

73
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,808
Well, what's there to talk about exactly?

74
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,766
The book I'm not writing?

75
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:55,099
The inspiration I don't feel?

76
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:57,558
Even the beer's flat.

77
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,183
I mean, look around, man.

78
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:00,433
Everything's stultified.

79
00:07:00,474 --> 00:07:02,391
True, but these are temporary worries.

80
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,808
Life is long and wondrous and strange.

81
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:06,849
Look at me, Sal.

82
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:07,933
I'm full of inspiration.

83
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:11,474
My mind is a veritable echo chamber of epiphanies.

84
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:15,641
Dig it "The air is dark.

85
00:07:15,683 --> 00:07:18,974
The night is sad...

86
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:21,391
I'll get you another beer !

87
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,349
Bravo, very nice, Carlo !

88
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,849
Chad.

89
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,058
I've been looking all over town for you hoodlums.

90
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:26,766
How you doing, man?

91
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:27,724
Listen, remember that thing?

92
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:30,349
Jailbird friend of mine from Denver?

93
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:31,641
The one that stole 500 cars?

94
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,558
The one I've been raving about?

95
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,683
He didn't think we really believed that, did he?

96
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:39,136
First reports of Dean came to me through Chad King,

97
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:41,503
who'd shown me and Carlo a few letters from him,

98
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,832
writtenfrom a Colorado reform school.

99
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:45,724
Come on man, let's go !

100
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,224
The great Dean awaits !

101
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,349
Dean had arrived in New York.

102
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:56,474
He'd just married a 16- year-old chick named Marylou.

103
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:57,266
New York, 1947.

104
00:07:59,016 --> 00:07:59,766
Come on, gentlemen.

105
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:00,183
One more.

106
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:24,224
Well, now, look who's at my doorstep, old Chad King !

107
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,266
How's it going, cowboy?

108
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:27,891
I'm Sal.

109
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,641
Sal.

110
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:30,433
Strong grip.

111
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:32,391
Yes, yes, yes !

112
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,433
Sal and Carlo, the writer pals.

113
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,891
I've heard all about you gone cats.

114
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,349
We're going to orient you into the Nietzschean ways of the big bad city.

115
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:42,141
And smoke your weed, of course.

116
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:43,557
Well, yes, we got plenty of that !

117
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,891
Marylou, why don't you get on the ball and make us some coffee?

118
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:49,891
My writer friends are here Come on in.

119
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:50,641
Hey hey !

120
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,432
Take your shoes off.

121
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:53,432
Yeah?

122
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:54,182
No, I'm just kidding.

123
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:02,786
(singing) Cry to hear folks chatter

124
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:09,455
And I know you cheat

125
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:14,063
Right or wrong don't matter

126
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:16,011
When you're with me, sweet...

127
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,391
Yes...

128
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,849
You'll never get this one.

129
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,397
(singing)Yipra (and continues)

130
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:26,686
That's not a song.

131
00:09:31,724 --> 00:09:32,432
Yipra (etc.

132
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:35,182
Slim Gaillard

133
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,432
Yes, yes, yes !

134
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,224
Slim it is.

135
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:38,849
Dean.

136
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,682
Some of us need the occasional doughnut to survive

137
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,807
Ah, "the occasional doughnut".

138
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,724
I just love this gal !

139
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:46,391
Yipra !

140
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,807
And wake up, Chad King.

141
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,266
Thanks.

142
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:03,641
It's nice to have someone paying attention.

143
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,724
I mean, it's really nice having someone pay attention !

144
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:20,474
You know, I never met a girl before who could roll tea.

145
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:21,599
Oh yeah?

146
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,016
Yipra...

147
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:30,891
My friend !

148
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,516
(Book title) Swann's Way

149
00:10:54,474 --> 00:11:01,224
The day before my father died, he took hold of my hand and he looked at it.

150
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:07,391
And he said, "You got no calluses, Sal.

151
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,516
That's because you don't do any real fucking work, boy !

152
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:12,849
"Oh, yeah?

153
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,599
Yeah.

154
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,641
My old man's still lost.

155
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:28,266
Just wandering the hobo streets of Denver like...

156
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,766
like shit.

157
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,849
To the old men

158
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:44,224
Yeah.

159
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:52,266
To the good, old, dead, demented men we love.

160
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,682
And to the West.

161
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:31,474
There you go

162
00:12:49,224 --> 00:12:54,182
It wasn't only because I was a writer and needed new experiences that I wanted to know Dean more.

163
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:58,390
But because somehow he reminded me of some long lost brother.

164
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:05,807
In the West, he'd spent a third of his time in the pool hall, a third in jail, and a third in the public library.

165
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:20,307
All my New York friends were giving their tired, bookish political or psychoanalytical reasons for being in the negative.

166
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,307
But Dean just raced in society.

167
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:25,932
I began to learn from him as much as he probably learned from me.

168
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,557
Oh yeah

169
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:51,182
Here's a cat who can really bend his girl, man !

170
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,932
Do you even know what we witnessed right there, Sal?

171
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,890
That tenor-man has it.

172
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:55,432
You see, he starts with the first chorus, then lines up his ideas, rises through his fate, and then suddenly, somewhere in the middle of the chorus, he gets it.

173
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:58,099
Everybody looks up and knows.

174
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,599
Time stops.

175
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:05,253
He has to blow across bridges and come back with such infinite feeling for the tune of the moment,

176
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:08,340
that everyone knows that it's not the tune that counts, but it.

177
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:14,640
"It-man", can I buy you that drink?

178
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:17,765
Make that three.

179
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:20,099
I'll buy you one.

180
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,807
Alright.

181
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:25,099
Thanks What's your name, man?

182
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,724
(laughs)They want to know my name !

183
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:51,348
There's some boys from work.

184
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,890
Hi, boys from work.

185
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:54,973
Howdy.

186
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:58,223
So, where was I?...

187
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:00,432
So there's this whore house.

188
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,932
There's this monkey at the door.

189
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:04,807
So you...

190
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:09,932
you place your bet in the cage, you know, and the monkey rolls the cage around, and the dice roll out...

191
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:14,765
And if you win, you get the girl for free.

192
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:21,348
But if you loose to that monkey, you gonna get your backside "bitched" !

193
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:23,640
By the monkey !

194
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,307
Now that's an evolution.

195
00:16:25,307 --> 00:16:26,765
"Sodom andGorilla".

196
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:29,140
I ain't telling no lie !

197
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:32,057
That's cool.

198
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:38,348
So what is it like being with a white woman?

199
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,932
I always wondered.

200
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:43,640
I'd say it's like...

201
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:47,223
You never been with a white woman before?

202
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:50,432
(No...) Been with a white man.

203
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,640
Ozone Park, Queens.

204
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,723
Come in, man.

205
00:16:57,765 --> 00:16:58,848
Memere !

206
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,598
C'est l'bon gars que j'tai parle.

207
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:02,932
Le chum a Chad, de Denver.

208
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,265
Howdy'do, Ma !

209
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:05,098
Hello.

210
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,057
You look just like her.

211
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,057
Come on, man.

212
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,973
Where's Marylou?

213
00:17:10,973 --> 00:17:11,807
Oh, man.

214
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:14,932
We get into a big ruckus, so she calls the cops on me.

215
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:18,015
Then she whores a few bucks together and heads back to Denver.

216
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:19,015
Whoa, really?

217
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:19,848
Yeah.

218
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:22,973
You know, I'm planning on heading back, too.

219
00:17:23,015 --> 00:17:24,348
When?

220
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,598
You know, soon.

221
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,932
Anyways, before I go, I absolutely have to learn how to write from you.

222
00:17:29,973 --> 00:17:31,932
Well, I'm honored, man, but I...

223
00:17:31,973 --> 00:17:32,598
Show me how !

224
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:33,640
Alright?

225
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,765
I want to learn.

226
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:35,848
Teach me.

227
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:49,557
Alright, then.

228
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,765
Alright, let's see.

229
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:03,307
"The cowboy thinks I'm some kind of genius.

230
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,723
He's leaning over my shoulder right now.

231
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,265
We gotta forget the Western stuff.

232
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:14,015
Turn ourselves into the Eastern jazz.

233
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:15,057
What about.

234
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:15,432
Hey.

235
00:18:25,307 --> 00:18:28,265
I was walking down 125th street and suddenly I stopped.

236
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,265
I looked at everything in amazement.

237
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:35,456
It was like I'd just woken up from a dream that had lasted my whole life,

238
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:39,584
and I realized that God isn't somewhere out there in Heaven, he's right here.

239
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:40,682
Yes.

240
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:41,765
In the dirt.

241
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:43,223
He's an ape like us.

242
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,598
Buh.

243
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:56,348
And I shambled after as usual, as I have done my whole life, after the people that interested me.

244
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,890
'Cause the only people that interest me are the mad ones.

245
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:13,223
The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones that never yawn and say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like Roman candles across the night.

246
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:27,931
BUS TRAFFIC ANNOUNCEMENT
... service from Albany and Poughkeepsie...

247
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:32,140
is now arriving at door number 3...

248
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:31,348
Come on.

249
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,265
Yes, Ma'am.

250
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:35,098
Where did you get the suit?

251
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,973
11 dollars on 3rd av'.

252
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:38,765
Come on, guys, concentrate.

253
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:48,348
Let's see.

254
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:54,306
For you.

255
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:58,431
And I'll keep this one.

256
00:19:58,473 --> 00:20:03,681
Sal, Sal, Sal

257
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:04,640
I'll miss you guys.

258
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:09,848
To the West-orooni !

259
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,098
To the West-orooni.

260
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:16,515
Don't forget to write, Carlo.

261
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:17,848
Don't do anything I wouldn't do !

262
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:22,473
I will.

263
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:25,390
Alas, alas, Sal.

264
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,181
It's not me, I'm drunk.

265
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:33,848
But my soul talking direct soul language, so to speak, to my deepest blood brother and holy goof—that's you.

266
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:39,931
And to be formal and analytical about it, let me objectify the characteristics I miss the most of you.

267
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:42,140
Number 1 your conversation.

268
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:46,056
Number 2 your brotherly smile, man.

269
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:52,056
But I shall go on, so to close and get the gist Denver waits for you.

270
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:58,015
Carlo in his damp grotto and clowned misery —to use a paradox of expression— waits for you, so get on it !

271
00:21:58,056 --> 00:22:01,348
Be quick and hurry to me, no delay.

272
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:02,431
Long dash.

273
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:05,348
Bring Paradise to Denver.

274
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:09,265
Bring Paradise to Denver.

275
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:11,890
And I love you as ever.

276
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,181
Dean.

277
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:15,348
Drunk.

278
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:45,973
With the coming of Dean Moriarty, began the part of my life you could call "My life on the Road".

279
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:52,473
Before that, I'd often dreamed of going West —always vaguely planning but never cutting out.

280
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:59,098
I was a young writer, trying to take off.

281
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:34,348
43 W80 C degrees in Clarion...

282
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,389
Dawson County, Nebraska.

283
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,431
Now what species are you?

284
00:23:58,514 --> 00:23:59,306
Traveler.

285
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:01,889
I appreciate the lift.

286
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,139
... It might be your last !

287
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:07,306
I'm freighting dynamite.

288
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:15,931
You looking for that toe?

289
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:18,764
They amputated it this morning.

290
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:23,598
You can't smoke, but you can drink in this car.

291
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,931
Alright Thanks.

292
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,431
"Follow me, I'm right behind you.

293
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,556
" Did it hurt?

294
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:38,098
I don't recommend it !

295
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:56,389
voice of (low) Shoot I gotta take me a piss.

296
00:24:56,431 --> 00:25:00,848
A truck with a flat board at the back with about six or seven boys sprawled out on it.

297
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:02,473
Piss call.

298
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:05,348
Woo-ee !

299
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,181
Here we go !

300
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:07,931
-yelled the kid in the baseball cap.

301
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,973
We been riding this son of a bitch since Des Moines !

302
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:12,764
These guys never stop!

303
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:19,806
Every now and then you have to yell for piss call, otherwise you have to piss off the air and hang on brother, hang on!

304
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:28,181
Denver, Colorado

305
00:25:30,723 --> 00:25:31,431
Thanks a lot, guys

306
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,723
N IN THE STREET (low) I know, it's.

307
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,681
I hope you're not paying rent on this place !

308
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:01,931
(laughs)Oh, my angel-headed Sal is here at last !

309
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,098
Good to see you.

310
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:04,931
You, too.

311
00:26:04,973 --> 00:26:07,306
So, what are you doing?

312
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:07,931
I mean.

313
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:10,764
What exactly are you doing?

314
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:14,931
I am vacuuming at May Company by day.

315
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:15,889
Uhmm...

316
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:16,722
Impressive.

317
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:17,389
... I know.

318
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:21,139
And chasing our beloved, feral, mad dog by night.

319
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:22,514
And where is Dean?

320
00:26:22,556 --> 00:26:22,931
What's the schedule?

321
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:25,514
So, I got off work a half hour ago.

322
00:26:25,597 --> 00:26:28,389
At that time, Dean is screwing Marylou at the hotel.

323
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:32,181
At one sharp, he goes from Marylou to Camille, the new girl.

324
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:37,639
Of course, neither knows what's going on, but he screws her once, giving me time to arrive at 130.

325
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:41,764
Then we go out for our unfinished business until 6 in the morning.

326
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:43,972
"Unfinished business"?

327
00:26:44,972 --> 00:26:50,347
Dean and I are trying to communicate with absolute honesty and completeness everything in our minds.

328
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:52,056
We do it on Benzedrine.

329
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:55,276
And then at 6, he goes back to Marylou and spends the rest of the day

330
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:57,651
running around trying to sort out the necessary papers for the divorce.

331
00:26:57,806 --> 00:27:01,389
All that he wants to do is go back to San Francisco and marry Camille.

332
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:03,014
It's sick !

333
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:05,222
And I bet she's incredibly ugly.

334
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:08,347
Like Helen of Troy with a fucking brain.

335
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:12,889
What are you doing?

336
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:14,806
(whispers)Camille really hates me right now.

337
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,556
Why, Sal !

338
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:23,806
(laughs)Yes, you've arrived !

339
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:26,931
You finally got on that old road, didn't you?

340
00:27:26,972 --> 00:27:27,764
I did.

341
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:34,139
Look here, Camille, it's my good buddy Sal from New York.

342
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:39,056
Sorry for not getting up, Sal, but I wasn't expecting company at this hour.

343
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:40,014
I'm sorry.

344
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:40,847
I should leave.

345
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:46,847
It's Sal's first time in Denver and I think it's absolutely necessary for me to take him out and fix him up with a girl.

346
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:47,806
Right now?

347
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:51,931
I should be back no later than 314 for our hour of reverie, darling.

348
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:54,097
Works all day, runs around all night.

349
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,847
He never eats, he never sleeps...

350
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:56,764
Ain't she something?

351
00:27:56,764 --> 00:27:57,889
The man thinks he's Superman.

352
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:58,847
Yeah.

353
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:01,306
As I said, not 3 but 314.

354
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:05,931
Now are we straight in the most wonderful and deepest depths of our soul, dear darling?

355
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:10,222
Is he offering me a choice?

356
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:12,514
I don't think he's offering you a choice, no.

357
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:17,264
Hee-hee !

358
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:18,972
Yes.

359
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:26,514
You look like a smart guy.

360
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:30,347
I bet you're wondering what he sees in me, huh?

361
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,556
Respectability?

362
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:35,889
Very good.

363
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:37,306
I'm impressed.

364
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:40,597
Let's go to work, babies.

365
00:28:40,639 --> 00:28:44,264
So now that you're sleeping with half of Denver, are there any girls left for me?

366
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:46,097
Well now listen here, Sal.

367
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:49,556
I know a girl named Rita and Rita cannot wait to meet you.

368
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:51,222
We'll go there at once !

369
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:52,389
I thought we were going to talk.

370
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,889
Yes, yes, after.

371
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:56,681
If you want to know my true nature, at this moment?

372
00:28:56,722 --> 00:28:59,889
I'm one of those people who goes around showing his cock to juvenile delinquents.

373
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:03,139
(Sal laughs)Oh, these Denver doldrums...

374
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:06,181
Isn't he the finest, smartest fellow in the world?

375
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:22,014
You know that old guy?

376
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:24,847
I thought it was my pops.

377
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,056
Carlo, wait up !

378
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:33,181
Voila.

379
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:42,972
Darling.

380
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:46,305
Bless me father, for I will sin.

381
00:29:52,597 --> 00:29:54,014
Yum, yum, yum

382
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:01,305
It's nice to have you boys.

383
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:07,722
What's so funny, my boy?

384
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,014
I'm checking my pulse.

385
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:14,305
Round two-sie, here we go !

386
00:30:18,472 --> 00:30:19,430
It happens.

387
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:21,222
My hands...

388
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:24,972
Mine does.

389
00:30:45,430 --> 00:31:13,722
I was filled with guilt.

390
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:16,597
I thought he said she was my girl.

391
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,722
Nothing for you or me, Sal.

392
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,097
Everything and everyone for that faithless bitch !

393
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,305
Guess who I hear !

394
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:33,014
Carlo, come on.

395
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:33,639
No.

396
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,097
Come on.

397
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:34,305
No.

398
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:34,930
Come on.

399
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:35,430
No.

400
00:31:35,472 --> 00:31:35,930
Come on.

401
00:31:36,014 --> 00:31:37,347
No no no no no

402
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:39,472
Sal No No.

403
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:40,389
Sal Argh .

404
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:45,472
Rebop Sal, come on.

405
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:48,222
Yeah-oh...

406
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:50,139
No clothes party.

407
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,055
You enjoying?

408
00:32:05,097 --> 00:32:08,722
Yeah, but now I'm finishing up my degree here in Denver.

409
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:11,972
Dean told me you do, uh, set design...

410
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,555
Set design, yeah.

411
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:14,680
That's interesting.

412
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,555
The one I enjoyed most designing was, uh, "Desire Under the Elms".

413
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:19,764
It's a great play.

414
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:20,639
Yeah.

415
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,097
Eugene O'Neill.

416
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,764
Yeah, I know it's Eugene O'Neill, Carlo.

417
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:25,680
Thank you.

418
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:29,555
There's like a rusty nail scratching across my goddam spinal cord.

419
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,639
Dean, "I've got the world on a string"?

420
00:32:32,805 --> 00:32:34,014
Yes, you do.

421
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:02,847
Come on !

422
00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:07,305
Don't tell me you New York intellectuals don't dance

423
00:33:08,097 --> 00:33:14,472
(Ella Fitzgerald) I've got the world on a string, sitting on a rainbow.

424
00:33:14,513 --> 00:33:16,805
Got the string...

425
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:29,597
around my finger... Oh, what a world, what a life, I'm in love...

426
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,222
You didn't say you had a nice voice.

427
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:39,055
I don't have a nice voice.

428
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:40,055
Yeah.

429
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:41,597
Yeah, you do.

430
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,972
Thanks.

431
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:47,805
Are you staying in Denver very long?

432
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,722
I got the feeling I won't be staying very long.

433
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:57,888
Yeah.

434
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,638
"Not enough hours in the day.

435
00:34:01,555 --> 00:34:02,513
"Right.

436
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,388
then.

437
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,097
singing along.

438
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,972
What a world, what a life, I'm in love...

439
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:25,176
(reading)"Assuming for yourself the sorrow of my body

440
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:28,591
Thus, when you solace me in my desire

441
00:34:28,592 --> 00:34:32,966
I held your body, and lay beside it sleeping

442
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,887
Feeling the pain of your own inward fire"

443
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:39,180
"Weeping myself to hear your silent weeping" .

444
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:46,472
Has Dean read this?

445
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:53,472
I've gotten so crazy over Dean that all his stupid friends call me "Carlo in Wonderland".

446
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:55,305
Clever, huh?

447
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:56,388
Ah, yes...

448
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:02,680
They don't understand this is the first time actual sex has been...

449
00:35:02,722 --> 00:35:05,847
part of my relationship with a man.

450
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,180
This is how you love.

451
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:15,180
I'm not in fucking wonderland.

452
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:16,680
I know it's not a man he wants.

453
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:19,847
I even told him we can take sexuality out of it, just...

454
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:24,638
"Be with me, man.

455
00:35:27,305 --> 00:35:28,263
Hold me.

456
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:31,597
Just call me."

457
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:37,722
And he always promises, "Yes, Carlo, yes, man - I'll call you.

458
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:38,763
I'll call you."

459
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,763
Who the fuck am I kidding?

460
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:45,138
I can't even call what I feel "a heartache", it's too banal.

461
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,263
"Melancholy" is too languorous.

462
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:51,930
"Grief" is closest.

463
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:56,305
I'm 21.

464
00:35:56,305 --> 00:35:59,597
By the time I'm 23 I'm going to write one great poem.

465
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:01,847
Then it's all over for me.

466
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:09,847
Sal, I'm leaving.

467
00:36:12,722 --> 00:36:13,472
I'm going to Africa.

468
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:15,472
A la Rimbaud, non?

469
00:36:15,513 --> 00:36:17,763
I might jump ship at Dakar.

470
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:19,722
I'm gonna smoke opium.

471
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,805
And I will pick up dark, mysterious men.

472
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:28,180
And they will love me.

473
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:41,763
I really wish I could drink whiskey like a man.

474
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,555
I know those guys are like, "Hey, do a shot !"

475
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:07,471
Home in Missoula, Home in Truckee, Home in Opelousas, Ain't no home for me.

476
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:15,433
Home in Ol'Medora, Home in Wounded Knee, Home in Ogallala, Home I'll never be.

477
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:45,513
Excuse me, miss.

478
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:48,013
I can't seem to find an empty seat anywhere.

479
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:50,346
May I?

480
00:37:51,346 --> 00:37:52,680
If you wish.

481
00:38:04,888 --> 00:38:05,471
I'm Sal.

482
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:08,305
Terry.

483
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,513
Selma, California.

484
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,096
No tienes hambre?

485
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:29,305
Que pasa Papa?

486
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,555
You want to love me now?

487
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,096
Cesar 1,20.

488
00:40:42,763 --> 00:40:45,304
Matilde 1,10.

489
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,554
Terry 1,15.

490
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:55,846
Terry.

491
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:58,763
Sal 1,05.

492
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:00,679
Sal.

493
00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:06,346
Maria 1,15.

494
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:08,388
You growing roots?

495
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,138
Jasmine 1,10.

496
00:41:23,763 --> 00:41:27,554
The harvest is ending, and it's getting much colder in the nights.

497
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:31,096
Terry and I bitterly decided we'd have to leave.

498
00:41:32,638 --> 00:41:38,013
She was supposed to come to New York in a month with her brother, but we both knew she wouldn't make it.

499
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:43,554
I can feel the pull of my own life calling me back.

500
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:46,096
I still have a book to write.

501
00:41:57,846 --> 00:41:59,846
(very low)We screw one more time, then you leave...

502
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:10,263
See you in New York, Terry !

503
00:43:20,221 --> 00:43:21,096
Wait.

504
00:43:29,346 --> 00:43:30,013
Thanks.

505
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:36,179
You know what they did to me in that prison?

506
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:39,054
Solitary confinement, and a Bible.

507
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,637
I used it to sit on the stone floor.

508
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,147
But when they seen that I did that, they took away that Bible,

509
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:49,498
and they brought back a little pocket size one, like so big, and I couldn't sit on it.

510
00:43:50,304 --> 00:43:53,221
You know why I been in prison my whole life?

511
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:58,887
When I was 13 years old, I was in a movie with a boy, and he makes a crack about my mother.

512
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:01,137
You know, that dirty word.

513
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:04,596
So I take out my jackknife and I cut up his throat.

514
00:44:04,637 --> 00:44:07,429
I would have killed him if they hadn't drug me off.

515
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:13,387
The judge says "Henry, you know what you were doing when you attacked your friend?

516
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:16,304
" I say, "Yes sir, YourHonor, I want to kill that son-of-a-bitch.

517
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:19,304
" And I still do.

518
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:35,637
Bah !

519
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,679
J'suis revenu rien qu'd'un morceau, memere !

520
00:44:37,721 --> 00:44:39,262
Penses-tu qu'fa m'fait quelqu'chose ?

521
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,762
Vieille sorciere !

522
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,596
It was over a year before I saw Dean again.

523
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:06,346
I stayed home most of the time, struggling with a half- finished manuscript on my desk.

524
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,429
Bored with all of it.

525
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:20,060
RECORD SONG I used to love you But it's all over All over now.

526
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,471
Sal's sister's house, North Carolina, December 1948.

527
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,679
Ma, on behalf of Nin and I, I just wanted to say that.

528
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:33,346
"ton gateau est fantastique !"

529
00:45:33,387 --> 00:45:36,012
Thank you Hey, eh, eh.

530
00:45:36,054 --> 00:45:42,679
Listen to this General Douglas MacArthur bans kissing on the streets of Tokyo.

531
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:45,679
Who does that puritanical old fart think he is?

532
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:47,304
Sal.

533
00:45:57,012 --> 00:46:00,721
Ho, ho, ho Oh hello, merry, merry…

534
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:03,429
Dean, I'll be goddamned !

535
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:04,179
You're early...

536
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:04,971
Yeah, well...

537
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,512
Shit Who's in the car?

538
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:09,762
Oh, it's Marylou and my good pal Ed Dunkel.

539
00:46:09,762 --> 00:46:12,971
Anyways we need a place to clean up immediately.

540
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,096
Man, we're dog tired.

541
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:14,971
Sure.

542
00:46:15,012 --> 00:46:16,137
How did you get here so fast?

543
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,429
That Hudson goes !

544
00:46:17,471 --> 00:46:18,596
Yeah?

545
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:19,971
Where did you get it?

546
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:21,971
I bought it out of my savings.

547
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:26,262
I was working as a breakman on the Southern Pacificmaking 400 bucks a month.

548
00:46:26,304 --> 00:46:27,429
And guess what?

549
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:30,179
I'm a father now !

550
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:31,929
What?

551
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:33,471
You and Marylou?

552
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,679
No, not Marylou.

553
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:35,512
Camille !

554
00:46:35,554 --> 00:46:38,929
I annuled Marylou, hitched up with Camille, and now we have a sweet little Amy.

555
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:41,471
And a nice little pad in 'Frisco.

556
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:46,054
But as God as my witness, Marylou is the only honey- cunt I'll ever adore.

557
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:48,887
That makes perfect sense.

558
00:46:52,512 --> 00:46:53,179
Dunkee !

559
00:46:54,637 --> 00:46:55,596
Dig this, Sal.

560
00:46:55,637 --> 00:46:58,762
Crazy Cat gets married and dumps his wife off in Tucson !

561
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:00,721
Come in, come in.

562
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:04,637
Holy shit.

563
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,346
We really appreciate this, man.

564
00:47:06,346 --> 00:47:08,429
There's no heater in that California car.

565
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:11,095
We haven't eaten in 30 hours.

566
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:12,679
Or slept in a bed since...

567
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,637
Denver?

568
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:15,012
We don't have a penny, one.

569
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:16,804
Good times on the Dean Express, huh?

570
00:47:17,887 --> 00:47:20,012
Well, there's lots of food inside for everybody.

571
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:21,012
Oh great, thanks.

572
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:23,679
Look at all them books.

573
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:27,095
Hi.

574
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:27,679
Hey.

575
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,554
How are you Marylou?

576
00:47:30,595 --> 00:47:31,929
I'm fine.

577
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,095
But I gotta tell you how nice it is to see a sane face.

578
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:40,679
Well, uh, sane is a very relative term around here, kid.

579
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,012
Don't call me that anymore, because that bastard aged me.

580
00:47:44,054 --> 00:47:46,220
Isn't that a great game to grab ass !

581
00:47:46,262 --> 00:47:50,054
If you want food, it's on the left.

582
00:47:56,512 --> 00:47:57,304
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

583
00:47:59,554 --> 00:48:05,364
Ma, to repay your gregarious hospitalities and all the trimmings on this fine day of holiday giving,

584
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:09,756
I will drive you and Sal up to old mad New York so you won't have to pay for a train.

585
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:13,554
How about that, Ma?

586
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:18,679
Ok...

587
00:48:23,095 --> 00:48:23,804
S.
sorry.

588
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:39,137
You don't know that feeling, man.

589
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:44,804
I stole a .

590
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:50,720
38 and I sat in the car, gun on my temple for 14 hours, Sal, trying to pull the trigger and I couldn't do.

591
00:48:53,304 --> 00:48:54,595
And I'm sweating.

592
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:56,762
And I'm nauseous.

593
00:48:56,804 --> 00:48:59,220
And Camille finds me this way, and I beg her to do it.

594
00:48:59,262 --> 00:49:00,970
To kill me.

595
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:03,679
And she couldn't, man.

596
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:10,012
I don't know what's wrong with me.

597
00:49:10,054 --> 00:49:14,845
I do all these dumb things and I think in all these distorted ways, you know, I'm burning up.

598
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:24,095
I'm scared I'm gonna lose all the wisdom I ever learned, Sal.

599
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:35,845
You know, I see a girl and I just, ... you know, I just tremble all over and I get lost !

600
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:38,554
Like a couple weeks ago.

601
00:49:38,595 --> 00:49:40,595
I meet this black boy, right?

602
00:49:40,637 --> 00:49:46,804
He's 25 and he's staying with his sugar mama, and we're digging some great music and we're getting high.

603
00:49:46,845 --> 00:49:49,054
And then I meet the greatest gone gal, Suzie, right.

604
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:50,304
Oh, Suzie !

605
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:52,762
And I swear she's a virgin.

606
00:49:52,804 --> 00:49:57,368
So I take her back to the black boy's place and 3 hours later she's getting a little drunk,

607
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,282
and the greatest show in the world starts, you know.

608
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:01,262
And she does this dance for us.

609
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:06,141
She takes off her panties, she leaves on her dress, and she stands on her head and she does the splits,

610
00:50:06,142 --> 00:50:08,549
you know, and she's screaming the whole time "I want your cock !"

611
00:50:09,012 --> 00:50:10,679
right, "I need your cock !"

612
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,715
And she goes over next to the bed and she spreads the black boy's knees open

613
00:50:13,716 --> 00:50:17,882
and pulls out his big black beauty and starts chugging on that, going on that thing, really going at it.

614
00:50:18,387 --> 00:50:23,179
Spreads the black girl's knees open and starts going down on her big black hairy muff, you know.

615
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,595
Getson the bed and does a whole other miraculous splits, you know.

616
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:28,929
Comes over to me, swallows me up.

617
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,304
Grabs the black boy's ears, pulls him down on her.

618
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:35,054
Black girl grabs me and its a goddam four-way orgy, Sal.

619
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:37,387
Goes on for four fucking hours.

620
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,553
God And I missed this?

621
00:50:46,637 --> 00:50:47,553
Yeah.

622
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:54,970
Yeah.

623
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,553
It's good to have family, isn't it?

624
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:43,262
Goddammit !

625
00:51:43,262 --> 00:51:46,776
You see, one day that little kid's gonna throw a rock through a guy's fucking windshield

626
00:51:46,777 --> 00:51:49,495
and he's going to crash and die all on account of that little piss-pants?

627
00:51:50,428 --> 00:51:51,178
See what I mean?

628
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,845
God exists without qualms.

629
00:52:05,512 --> 00:52:06,470
South Hill, Virginia.

630
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:12,053
<i>Coming up next Mike Sullivan covers the weather for your......</i>

631
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:19,428
<i>going to be up for some low...</i>

632
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,012
Stop.

633
00:52:35,012 --> 00:52:35,887
Que c'est qu'il fait ?

634
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:37,803
Hein ?

635
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:39,512
Comme dit le President Truman .

636
00:52:39,595 --> 00:52:42,137
"We have to cut down on the cost of living."

637
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,178
Whooooaooo !

638
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,720
Man, oh, man, we must absolutely findsome time for kicks in New York !

639
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:01,887
Carlo's back from Africa.

640
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:05,137
We all get to see Carlo first thing in the morning, darlings.

641
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:22,178
Lady, you shouldn't let your son drive that fast in these conditions.

642
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:25,678
You're in my state, you slow down.

643
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:31,762
I'll pay you back every cent, Ma.

644
00:53:31,803 --> 00:53:34,970
Oh, you're fucked now, Dean.

645
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:47,637
But all I'm saying in the sincerities of my soul is that I miss you, darling, and I'll be right back in those arms.

646
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:50,012
(over the phone) Look, I got your postcard from Denver.

647
00:53:50,053 --> 00:53:51,428
Do you think I'm an idiot?

648
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,803
I know Denver means Marylou.

649
00:53:52,845 --> 00:53:54,178
Marylou who?

650
00:53:56,387 --> 00:53:57,512
Come on, Sweet Cakes.

651
00:53:57,553 --> 00:53:59,303
You know there are certainties our minds can grasp.

652
00:53:59,345 --> 00:54:00,845
(over the phone) Oh shut up!

653
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:02,095
I never want you back!

654
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:03,262
Don't you dare come back here!

655
00:54:03,303 --> 00:54:04,345
Ever!

656
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:30,595
This is the new and complete Dean, grown to his own definition of maturity.

657
00:54:30,636 --> 00:54:34,761
I say to myself, "My God, he's changed!

658
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:38,345
" Fury spits out of his eyes when he tells of things he hates.

659
00:54:38,386 --> 00:54:41,970
Great glows of joy replace this when suddenly he gets happy.

660
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:45,053
Every muscle lives to twitch and go.

661
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:47,345
Sal

662
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:52,720
Yeah?

663
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,928
Phone for you.

664
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:54,678
Thanks.

665
00:54:57,095 --> 00:54:57,720
Hello?

666
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,511
(over the phone)Sal Paradise?

667
00:54:59,553 --> 00:55:01,511
Bull calling you from New Orleans.

668
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:02,511
Bull Lee?

669
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:03,345
How the hell are you?

670
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:08,011
Well, we have ourselves a situation that needs immediate rectifying.

671
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:11,553
I've got a girl down here just showed up on my doorstep.

672
00:55:11,553 --> 00:55:18,845
This Galatea Dunkel is looking for some clown named Ed Dunkel, and I don't know who the hell these people are.

673
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:22,178
Uh, Galatea and Ed are friends of Dean's from Denver.

674
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,095
Oh, shit Dean ...

675
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:29,011
Well, she wants to talk to you.

676
00:55:29,053 --> 00:55:31,136
Make it fast, would you?

677
00:55:31,178 --> 00:55:34,095
The telephone cartels don't do this for free.

678
00:55:38,053 --> 00:55:39,511
Hello, its Galatea.

679
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:40,970
Is Ed there?

680
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:44,011
Uh, Ed's fine, but he's sleeping.

681
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,220
Well, would you please tell him to come and get me.

682
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:52,011
Mr. Lee and his wife don't seem all that happy to have me around.

683
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:56,053
And I should kill Ed for what he did to me, dumping me here like this !

684
00:55:56,095 --> 00:55:59,761
And he's simply got to come and get me as soon as he can !

685
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:04,553
He's got to help me, these people are mad They're mad!

686
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:06,553
Well, we'll be there right after New Years.

687
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,595
Thank you.

688
00:56:16,636 --> 00:56:18,053
Mmm hmm.

689
00:56:21,095 --> 00:56:21,928
(singing) Dynamite!

690
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:27,595
Look at that !

691
00:56:27,595 --> 00:56:28,803
Oh my !

692
00:56:53,761 --> 00:56:54,970
I'm telling you, she's cross-eyed.

693
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,053
She's not looking at you, it's me.

694
00:56:56,095 --> 00:57:02,470
I was twenty days at sea in the doldrums, uh, when I decided to kill myself.

695
00:57:02,511 --> 00:57:06,720
And I realized that shit, I haven't written a fucking suicide note !

696
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:10,013
I'm going over, you know, searching my mind for the right words,

697
00:57:10,014 --> 00:57:14,151
and then I saw all of the crew coming out onto the deck,

698
00:57:14,152 --> 00:57:15,837
and I couldn't jump anymore.

699
00:57:16,261 --> 00:57:20,678
But, in that moment, I resolved to follow my heart.

700
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:22,345
To live.

701
00:57:22,386 --> 00:57:23,303
Yeah.

702
00:57:23,345 --> 00:57:25,470
To experience the wisdom of life,

703
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,011
Yes.

704
00:57:26,053 --> 00:57:31,428
mad with ecstasy and vengeance and truth.

705
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:35,803
I'm glad I did, because otherwise I would have missed out on this amazing pot.

706
00:57:37,511 --> 00:57:38,261
So !

707
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:44,136
On that, on that note, everybody move their feet like you feel something, like you're alive !

708
00:57:45,053 --> 00:57:45,969
Like we're alive !

709
00:57:46,011 --> 00:57:53,344
And on that, I want us to raise our glasses, being alive, (Yeah ) to living, and to life.

710
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:56,928
and others To life(All cheer)

711
00:57:57,886 --> 00:57:59,469
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

712
00:57:59,511 --> 00:58:02,386
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

713
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:05,636
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

714
00:58:07,386 --> 00:58:08,928
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

715
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,428
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

716
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:24,803
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

717
00:58:24,844 --> 00:58:27,844
Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!

718
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,553
Where do you find such absolutely wonderful people?

719
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,386
I've never seen anyone like that.

720
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:49,594
She's the real mad one !

721
00:59:19,803 --> 00:59:20,761
with Seven !

722
00:59:20,803 --> 00:59:21,511
Six !

723
00:59:21,553 --> 00:59:22,469
Five !

724
00:59:22,511 --> 00:59:23,261
Four !

725
00:59:23,303 --> 00:59:24,011
Three !

726
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:24,761
Two !

727
00:59:24,803 --> 00:59:25,636
One !

728
00:59:26,011 --> 00:59:27,719
Happy New Year(cheers)

729
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:31,344
1949 !

730
00:59:31,386 --> 00:59:33,136
Happy New Year !

731
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:34,969
Love you as ever, Sal.

732
00:59:35,011 --> 00:59:35,886
Whatever man.

733
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:36,511
Love you.

734
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:36,928
Love you.

735
00:59:36,928 --> 00:59:38,053
What have you got?

736
00:59:52,928 --> 00:59:53,803
Hell of a night !

737
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:55,511
Happy New Year ...

738
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,178
I love you...

739
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:05,886
Sal, I have something to ask of you, very important.

740
01:00:05,928 --> 01:00:06,844
Uh-uh.

741
01:00:06,886 --> 01:00:08,511
I wonder how you'll take it.

742
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:11,428
We're buddies, aren't we?

743
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:15,094
Yeah?...

744
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:17,928
Carlo's apartment, Harlem.

745
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:28,261
Sal said yes, my darling.

746
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,178
Sal, that's great.

747
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,219
Well, hop in, the water's fine.

748
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:45,303
What?

749
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:30,636
Fuck, I can't do this !

750
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:31,469
Come on, man.

751
01:01:31,511 --> 01:01:32,594
You promised.

752
01:01:32,636 --> 01:01:34,552
Do you really want to do this, Marylou?

753
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:37,844
She thinks it's swell.

754
01:01:52,052 --> 01:01:52,844
What?

755
01:01:52,886 --> 01:01:56,052
Now, come on now, we have to just all goddam relax !

756
01:01:57,761 --> 01:01:58,302
Dean.

757
01:01:58,344 --> 01:02:01,011
Can you go wait in the kitchen?

758
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,677
Like now, please?

759
01:02:15,052 --> 01:02:17,302
Honey, he just wants to see what it would be like.

760
01:02:19,177 --> 01:02:22,469
I told him that I wouldn't do that with any guy (whispers) but you.

761
01:02:31,386 --> 01:02:33,219
Well, you can still change your mind.

762
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:05,177
(Sound of Marylou and Dean having sex)Very good.

763
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:21,927
(off) Gee.

764
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:22,552
Write that down.

765
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:23,677
I got it.

766
01:03:27,844 --> 01:03:30,844
So Ed, why did you abandon Galatea in Tucson?

767
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:32,344
She's your wife.

768
01:03:34,302 --> 01:03:37,011
What are you doing wandering around the country like this?

769
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:42,094
Dean, why did you leave Camille and pick up Marylou?

770
01:03:42,136 --> 01:03:44,219
What are your womanly intentions?

771
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:49,552
And, what is this mad obsession you have with him?

772
01:03:52,302 --> 01:03:54,677
(laughs)What is this mad obsession you have with him?

773
01:03:56,802 --> 01:03:57,719
Touche !

774
01:03:59,886 --> 01:04:01,844
Days of wrath are coming my friends.

775
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:05,094
This high you're on is a mirage.

776
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:10,844
You're all going to go flying off to the West Coast and come crashing down to earth.

777
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:13,052
Like this, Carlo?

778
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:16,552
Yeah, Dean.

779
01:04:18,552 --> 01:04:19,802
Exactly like that.

780
01:04:19,844 --> 01:04:21,677
Alrighty, who's hungry?

781
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:40,802
We were leaving confusion and nonsense behind, and performing our one noble function of the time move.

782
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,760
New Orleans and ol'Bull Lee.

783
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:46,969
Then West.

784
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:50,844
It would take all night to talk about ol' Bull Lee.

785
01:04:52,177 --> 01:04:54,094
Let's just say now he was a teacher.

786
01:04:54,135 --> 01:04:57,802
And he had every right to teach, 'cuz he spent all his time learning.

787
01:05:16,927 --> 01:05:17,719
Now listen darling.

788
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:24,052
You know that I'm capable of everything at the same time, and I have unlimited energy.

789
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:30,052
So now when we get back to San Francisco we must absolutely go on living together.

790
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,302
I know just the place for you to live.

791
01:05:34,302 --> 01:05:39,260
I'll be home every night and be at Camille's by the morning.

792
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:42,344
We've done it before, see, she'll never know.

793
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:57,677
<i>Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause.</i>

794
01:05:57,677 --> 01:06:03,094
<i>It decrees what information he shall receive, what art he shall produce.</i>

795
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,844
<i>Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral...</i>

796
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:08,219
Shit.

797
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:09,302
Ed, slow down.

798
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:11,302
Underpants.

799
01:06:25,802 --> 01:06:29,927
Do you guys think you can rush through here as fast as you want 'cuz you're from California?

800
01:06:30,969 --> 01:06:33,427
Don't worry officer, we're heading back to California.

801
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,052
I need everybody to step out of that car, please.

802
01:06:45,094 --> 01:06:46,052
How old are you, young lady?

803
01:06:46,052 --> 01:06:48,094
I'm eighteen.

804
01:06:48,135 --> 01:06:50,385
Who's that guy you're with?

805
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:51,885
My husband.

806
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,885
I've got the certificate right in the back if you want to see it.

807
01:06:58,344 --> 01:07:00,802
Who you all in such a hurry to see out there in California?

808
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:03,510
My wife.

809
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,052
Your wife?

810
01:07:07,094 --> 01:07:10,344
This one here just said she's your wife.

811
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:12,802
She's my ex-wife.

812
01:07:12,844 --> 01:07:16,385
What the hell you doing with your ex-wife?

813
01:07:16,427 --> 01:07:17,760
You're going out to see your wife !

814
01:07:17,802 --> 01:07:18,635
That's not important.

815
01:07:18,677 --> 01:07:19,177
Hey boy !

816
01:07:19,219 --> 01:07:22,302
You gonna waltz in here and tell me what's important?

817
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:37,635
It's gonna be 25 dollars for speeding.

818
01:07:37,677 --> 01:07:38,594
Or what?

819
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:43,844
Or I can run you in right now and slap a special California-boy charge on your ass.

820
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:44,635
Yeah?

821
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:45,469
What charge?

822
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,010
Don't you worry about it, wise guy.

823
01:07:59,344 --> 01:08:01,052
That guy's got it so goddam easy !

824
01:08:01,094 --> 01:08:03,010
They'll out and shoot you if you complain, too.

825
01:08:03,052 --> 01:08:04,844
I wish I had a fucking gun !

826
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:08,218
Dunkel, you are not driving anymore.

827
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:11,968
Marylou, spread those knees and lets smoke some weed.

828
01:08:37,343 --> 01:08:38,177
It was my father's.

829
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:42,385
It works.

830
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:53,135
Thanks a lot.

831
01:09:03,302 --> 01:09:04,385
Flomaton, Alabama

832
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,177
<i>Don't know...</i>

833
01:09:08,218 --> 01:09:09,872
<i>When it comes to buying a gift or it comes to buy a present, </i>

834
01:09:09,873 --> 01:09:12,365
<i>I never have to wonder, I never have to thunder.</i>

835
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:16,125
<i>If it's a wedding present, if it's an engagement present, if its a shower,</i>

836
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:19,891
<i> it it's a husband who wants to buy his wife something, I know exactly what to say...</i>

837
01:09:20,635 --> 01:09:21,718
<i>I go to...</i>

838
01:09:22,802 --> 01:09:24,927
Like President Truman says.

839
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,635
"You have to cut down on the cost of living."

840
01:09:27,635 --> 01:09:29,927
Yes, yes we do.

841
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:52,135
I'm telling you it's true Sal, I started at 9.

842
01:09:53,218 --> 01:09:54,635
With a girl named Millie Mayfair !

843
01:09:54,677 --> 01:09:57,760
That's when my old man was barbering a bit still.

844
01:09:57,802 --> 01:10:03,260
Oh honey Marylou, if only I'd known you then, how sweet you must have been at 9 !

845
01:10:04,677 --> 01:10:06,343
Hey, here's another one for you Sal.

846
01:10:06,427 --> 01:10:09,510
One time I jumped a freight from New Mexico clear to LA.

847
01:10:09,593 --> 01:10:10,468
And I was 11.

848
01:10:10,468 --> 01:10:15,927
I lost my father along the side, and we were staying in a hobo jungle and I hadn't seen him for months.

849
01:10:15,968 --> 01:10:20,954
So, by the time I get to LA I'm so starved for milk that I get a job right in the dairy

850
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:24,489
and straight off drink 2 quarts of heavy cream and just puke

851
01:10:27,885 --> 01:10:29,593
Poor, tragic Dean

852
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:06,093
So Dunkel, I suppose you're happy to get back to your wife.

853
01:11:23,177 --> 01:11:24,010
Algiers, Louisiana

854
01:11:39,385 --> 01:11:40,176
Bull?

855
01:11:43,343 --> 01:11:44,010
Jane?

856
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:48,260
Hello?

857
01:12:07,385 --> 01:12:07,968
Bull?

858
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:17,468
Bull?

859
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:23,760
Bull?

860
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,843
That sounds like the angel Sal Paradise.

861
01:12:35,676 --> 01:12:36,468
How are you?

862
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:41,885
Fair.

863
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:52,635
Hi Jane !

864
01:12:54,593 --> 01:12:56,260
We finally brought Ed Dunkel with us.

865
01:12:58,760 --> 01:12:59,843
Is Galatea home?

866
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:02,968
Excuse me.

867
01:13:05,093 --> 01:13:06,135
Lizards.

868
01:13:26,343 --> 01:13:27,010
Ed?

869
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:30,301
Hi, Galatea

870
01:13:32,176 --> 01:13:33,843
Get out of my sight !

871
01:13:34,593 --> 01:13:35,551
You're an animal !

872
01:13:35,593 --> 01:13:38,385
I guess I'll go help the missus sweep the tree.

873
01:13:38,426 --> 01:13:40,301
Ass !

874
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:43,801
You're Sal, right?

875
01:13:43,843 --> 01:13:45,968
It depends.

876
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:47,801
Do you know what these bastards did to me?

877
01:13:47,843 --> 01:13:51,926
Dean leaves his wife and baby penniless because he wants to visit you.

878
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:55,260
And Ed, being a sheep wants to tag along.

879
01:13:55,301 --> 01:13:56,885
Only they have no money !

880
01:13:56,926 --> 01:14:01,051
So Ed asks me for the money, and I say, "I'm not giving you any unless we're married."

881
01:14:01,093 --> 01:14:04,426
And Dean says, "Hey, Ed, stupid ass.

882
01:14:04,468 --> 01:14:05,676
Marry the broad !

883
01:14:05,718 --> 01:14:06,885
"No, I do love you too, honey...

884
01:14:06,885 --> 01:14:07,385
Shut up !

885
01:14:07,718 --> 01:14:09,301
So he marries me for gas fare !

886
01:14:09,343 --> 01:14:12,347
And we get in the car, and Dean drives like Satan,

887
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:14,698
smoking marijuana the whole way,

888
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:17,026
and they won't even let me stop to use the ladies room.

889
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:22,718
And when I say something about it, they dump me in Tucson. In Tucson!

890
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:25,676
Come on, Galatea.

891
01:14:25,718 --> 01:14:27,010
I mean.

892
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:29,426
Dean will be dead some day and then what can you say to him?

893
01:14:29,426 --> 01:14:30,801
The sooner he's dead, the better.

894
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,385
Where were you going?

895
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:38,801
Can't I watch you guys screw?

896
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:42,801
Honey, I'm sorry.

897
01:14:42,801 --> 01:14:44,468
A week, a couple of weeks.

898
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:45,010
I just thought...

899
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:45,885
You just thought what?

900
01:14:45,926 --> 01:14:48,218
You could just leave me here in this house with strangers?

901
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:08,719
"Old woman, old woman, old woman, quoth I, "

902
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,159
"Oh whither, oh whither, oh whither so high "

903
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:15,124
"To brush the cobwebs off the sky"

904
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:17,652
"Shall I go with thee?"

905
01:15:20,093 --> 01:15:21,384
I would go with her.

906
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:25,836
We could go together, and we could brush the cobwebs from the sky.

907
01:15:26,426 --> 01:15:28,676
"By and by, by and by."

908
01:15:28,718 --> 01:15:31,509
What the hell has he ever done to anyone?

909
01:15:31,509 --> 01:15:34,426
Well, he drove my mother halfway across the country.

910
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:35,468
Did he?

911
01:15:35,509 --> 01:15:36,301
Yeah.

912
01:15:37,551 --> 01:15:38,468
Nah...

913
01:15:39,884 --> 01:15:43,468
Dean does not feel responsibility towards others.

914
01:15:43,509 --> 01:15:45,343
He does not know the concept.

915
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:51,509
Then again, he feels others have some mysterious obligation to support him.

916
01:15:52,384 --> 01:15:53,634
No, I'm OK, Bull.

917
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,051
I find it unspeakably distasteful.

918
01:15:57,093 --> 01:16:00,301
But Dean gives everyone a damn good time just being himself

919
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:02,259
He gives illusions.

920
01:16:02,301 --> 01:16:03,259
Tricks.

921
01:16:03,301 --> 01:16:07,801
Maybe that's because you're not seeing what's really holy about Dean.

922
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,509
So he's a holy man now !

923
01:16:10,551 --> 01:16:13,343
A religious figure in your eyes !

924
01:16:13,384 --> 01:16:14,968
Argh, Paradise ...

925
01:16:14,968 --> 01:16:17,801
Aren't you a pretty little bird?...

926
01:16:17,843 --> 01:16:20,593
What I see in him is compulsive psychosis.

927
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:25,176
Dashed with a jigger of psychopathic irresponsibility and violence.

928
01:16:31,968 --> 01:16:36,301
Well, young man, I do believe the cocktail hour is upon us.

929
01:16:38,676 --> 01:16:43,426
Now this nation is dead in its soul and we do nothing.

930
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:47,051
All we do is wait, for the end to come.

931
01:16:48,676 --> 01:16:49,176
See?

932
01:16:49,218 --> 01:16:49,801
She knows.

933
01:16:49,843 --> 01:16:52,176
The female always knows.

934
01:16:52,218 --> 01:16:55,759
And the end of the world will start here, too.

935
01:16:55,843 --> 01:16:57,551
In Texas.

936
01:16:58,343 --> 01:16:59,218
Louisiana.

937
01:17:00,926 --> 01:17:03,468
Louisiana and Texas.

938
01:17:05,468 --> 01:17:07,593
This is an outstanding martini.

939
01:17:07,634 --> 01:17:09,676
Yes.

940
01:17:09,676 --> 01:17:11,593
May I?

941
01:17:11,634 --> 01:17:13,051
Please.

942
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:13,801
MmmMmm.

943
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,176
That is an outstanding martini.

944
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:32,468
You know that a bat, when they suck the blood out of things squirrels, and...

945
01:17:32,509 --> 01:17:33,843
Dad, draw a face.

946
01:17:33,884 --> 01:17:35,426
Dad draw a face.

947
01:17:35,468 --> 01:17:43,343
They got teeth, long teeth, that's what they stick in the squirrels and then they suck the blood out of them.

948
01:17:43,384 --> 01:17:45,509
What's their names?

949
01:17:45,509 --> 01:17:50,759
I think, uh, Lorraine is a good name for a bat.

950
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:52,509
That's Lorraine

951
01:17:52,509 --> 01:17:57,634
I need some wings on it like that, ain't that right, you little beast?

952
01:17:57,676 --> 01:17:58,935
Here the toes.

953
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:02,464
I'm gonna sell it for a lot of money.

954
01:18:02,465 --> 01:18:03,465
Money...

955
01:18:36,426 --> 01:18:38,967
Translation is indeed treason.

956
01:18:39,009 --> 01:18:40,467
I got him.

957
01:18:40,509 --> 01:18:42,342
In English you got him saying "fingers rummaging...

958
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:43,217
person...

959
01:18:43,259 --> 01:18:44,217
in his pockets".

960
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:46,634
Celine did not write that.

961
01:18:46,676 --> 01:18:51,009
He wrote, "Hands in assholes and pockets."

962
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:52,134
Uh.

963
01:18:55,217 --> 01:19:01,842
Well, um, if you could push it away from here.

964
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:04,259
Away, um, the crumbs.

965
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:07,717
So, how's it been with Ed?

966
01:19:07,759 --> 01:19:10,551
I don't know how to do it.

967
01:19:11,801 --> 01:19:13,509
How to make him happy.

968
01:19:15,592 --> 01:19:18,176
Oh, it's simple really, honey, all you have to do is...

969
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:25,842
Okay, I'm.

970
01:19:25,842 --> 01:19:29,301
Here is you, here's him, right here.

971
01:19:29,342 --> 01:19:31,009
palm of your hand.

972
01:19:31,051 --> 01:19:34,926
I mean, with mouth, but he'll be in the palm of your hand.

973
01:19:34,967 --> 01:19:36,842
Boys always love that.

974
01:19:36,842 --> 01:19:39,051
You'll love it too, I promise.

975
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:43,426
Merci

976
01:19:45,426 --> 01:19:53,717
Now, something can and should be done to eliminate the black seed of noxious effluviants gestating in our unsuspecting gut.

977
01:19:53,759 --> 01:19:57,592
I give you the orgone accumulator !

978
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:02,426
Captures the vibratory atmospheric atoms of the life principal.

979
01:20:02,467 --> 01:20:06,467
Folks get cancer 'cuz they run out of orgone.

980
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:07,801
Come on !

981
01:20:07,842 --> 01:20:09,426
You gotta try it with me.

982
01:20:09,467 --> 01:20:11,884
It'll put some juice in your bones, I'm telling you.

983
01:20:11,926 --> 01:20:17,592
I always rush up and take off 90 miles to the nearest whore house !

984
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:24,092
All right, oh hey, look at that, see how big he got?

985
01:20:24,176 --> 01:20:28,176
See that, not an inch of cancer !

986
01:20:32,009 --> 01:20:32,926
Let's crank her up.

987
01:20:35,259 --> 01:20:37,509
And don't let the cocksuckers get you down

988
01:20:37,509 --> 01:20:39,217
Looks like a fucking closet

989
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:49,509
The purity of the road.

990
01:20:51,551 --> 01:20:58,176
The white line in the middle of the highway unrolled, and hugged our left front tire as if glued to our groove.

991
01:20:58,217 --> 01:21:00,592
Dunkel, Dunkle, who's gonna shepherd you now?

992
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:02,967
Here are a couple bucks for you.

993
01:21:02,967 --> 01:21:04,759
You know you don't have to do that, Bull.

994
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:06,509
It's alright, it's only money.

995
01:21:06,551 --> 01:21:07,759
Thanks.

996
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:08,967
Don't forget to write !

997
01:21:09,009 --> 01:21:10,051
I won't.

998
01:21:10,092 --> 01:21:11,176
Bye, brother.

999
01:21:12,842 --> 01:21:14,842
Dean, you keep her out of the ditch !

1000
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:26,259
And zoom went the car!

1001
01:21:26,301 --> 01:21:28,217
And we were off again - for California.

1002
01:21:57,426 --> 01:21:59,176
Hey, listen to this one, Sal.

1003
01:22:00,676 --> 01:22:03,176
"'Not caring for their lives' is it?

1004
01:22:03,217 --> 01:22:05,908
Why, what in the world is there that we should care

1005
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:10,899
for if it is not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a second time."

1006
01:22:16,717 --> 01:22:18,134
What do you think about that one, Sal?

1007
01:22:19,175 --> 01:22:20,050
Welcome.

1008
01:22:20,467 --> 01:22:21,009
I'll be right with you.

1009
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:21,425
Thanks.

1010
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:44,550
Willcox, Arizona

1011
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:10,759
Can't you wait 'til we're in Frisco?

1012
01:23:14,134 --> 01:23:15,134
I don't care.

1013
01:23:15,134 --> 01:23:17,300
Dean's gonna leave me anyway.

1014
01:23:20,384 --> 01:23:21,717
When are you going to go back to Denver?

1015
01:23:24,509 --> 01:23:25,259
I don't know.

1016
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,342
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1017
01:23:27,384 --> 01:23:29,509
I could go back to my fiance.

1018
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:32,842
Fiance?

1019
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,300
He's a sailor.

1020
01:23:35,342 --> 01:23:37,634
He's been away awhile.

1021
01:23:37,675 --> 01:23:38,509
He's.

1022
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,134
he's nice.

1023
01:23:39,175 --> 01:23:40,509
That's good.

1024
01:23:44,925 --> 01:23:47,092
I wish Dean wasn't so crazy now.

1025
01:23:47,134 --> 01:23:49,092
You could be wishing that the rest of your life !

1026
01:23:51,884 --> 01:23:53,050
I just want a house.

1027
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:54,467
A baby.

1028
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:57,884
You know, something normal.

1029
01:23:57,925 --> 01:23:59,592
I really do want that.

1030
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:14,425
I just had a great idea, you guys are gonna love it.

1031
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:17,634
Is everybody absolutely comfortable?

1032
01:24:29,884 --> 01:24:30,884
You alright Sal?

1033
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,217
(Yeah.

1034
01:24:59,217 --> 01:25:04,350
"For it always happened when I woke like this and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt

1035
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:11,118
to discover where I was, everything would be moving around me through the darkness, things, places, years.

1036
01:25:11,675 --> 01:25:15,342
My body still too heavy with sleep to move."

1037
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:38,092
How much money you got, kid?

1038
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,258
Nothing.

1039
01:25:39,258 --> 01:25:41,758
But I got an aunt in Tulare, California.

1040
01:25:41,842 --> 01:25:45,508
She owns a grocery store and as soon as we get there, I'll have money for you all.

1041
01:25:45,508 --> 01:25:52,925
Yes, yes, we all got aunts, well let's go jump in back, let's see the aunts and uncles and grocery stores all away across the road to get our kicks.

1042
01:25:55,258 --> 01:25:55,883
I'm Alfred.

1043
01:25:55,883 --> 01:25:56,592
Sal.

1044
01:25:56,592 --> 01:25:57,300
Hi.

1045
01:25:57,342 --> 01:25:57,967
Marylou.

1046
01:25:58,008 --> 01:25:58,633
Hi.

1047
01:25:58,675 --> 01:25:59,092
Alfred.

1048
01:26:02,967 --> 01:26:09,258
Hot damn, I left Bakersfield in a travel bureau car, left my guitar in the trunk of another one.

1049
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,550
It never showed up.

1050
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:13,342
Guitars and cowboy duds.

1051
01:26:13,383 --> 01:26:14,800
How much you got?

1052
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,300
How much you want?

1053
01:26:30,508 --> 01:26:34,758
I knew a man, he forgave his wife for shooting him and got her out of jail.

1054
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,633
Only, she shoots him a second time !

1055
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:42,717
That's a good one

1056
01:26:43,383 --> 01:26:45,467
Hold on to your girdles

1057
01:26:49,092 --> 01:26:50,633
Baby !

1058
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:03,133
Yes, yes, yes

1059
01:27:34,092 --> 01:27:39,694
(singing) Had my finger on the trigger so long

1060
01:27:40,614 --> 01:27:44,789
Seems like I'd shoot again by now

1061
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:51,553
So hard when you can't stand the sound

1062
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,687
I gathered your remains, cleaned up the stains

1063
01:27:59,688 --> 01:28:04,477
I took care for we once were friends

1064
01:28:05,821 --> 01:28:11,364
But it's hard when you're burning in a hell

1065
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:20,517
And it's hard enough to be in love

1066
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:29,447
And it's hard, ain't it hard, to love what you kill

1067
01:28:46,967 --> 01:28:47,925
San Francisco, California

1068
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:25,203
(low) Alright.

1069
01:29:29,836 --> 01:29:30,555
Go, hurry !

1070
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:35,225
Really, you better make it to Camille's in time for dinner so she can feed your lazy ass !

1071
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:42,516
Do you see what a bastard he is?

1072
01:30:11,641 --> 01:30:13,058
By the end of the week, darling.

1073
01:30:17,183 --> 01:30:17,891
Thank you.

1074
01:30:17,933 --> 01:30:19,808
Thank you.

1075
01:32:32,516 --> 01:32:33,808
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop !

1076
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:58,141
Darling Sal, I'm going back to Denver, to my fiance the sailor.

1077
01:32:58,183 --> 01:33:00,433
No more road for me.

1078
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:03,599
Thanks for an amazing night, my sweet lover.

1079
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:07,349
Why don'tyou kick Dean in the ass if you ever see him again.

1080
01:33:07,391 --> 01:33:09,099
I love you.

1081
01:33:09,141 --> 01:33:10,974
P.S.

1082
01:33:11,391 --> 01:33:12,558
Good luck with your book.

1083
01:34:54,808 --> 01:34:56,058
What the hell you looking at?

1084
01:35:05,141 --> 01:35:07,558
Campbell, California

1085
01:35:47,838 --> 01:35:48,378
Yoshi.

1086
01:35:51,843 --> 01:35:52,704
Brada.

1087
01:35:56,724 --> 01:35:57,433
Rodriguez.

1088
01:36:00,472 --> 01:36:01,221
Luigi.

1089
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:12,641
Sal.. Shit, no. Oh oh oh

1090
01:37:15,391 --> 01:37:16,557
How the hell are you, man?

1091
01:37:16,599 --> 01:37:18,557
Better than you, my boy.

1092
01:37:18,557 --> 01:37:20,057
Have you eaten these last few months?

1093
01:37:20,099 --> 01:37:21,974
Not as much as you, fat ass !

1094
01:37:27,214 --> 01:37:28,849
Family man, huh?

1095
01:37:28,891 --> 01:37:29,807
Yeah.

1096
01:37:32,016 --> 01:37:32,849
How's Camille?

1097
01:37:32,891 --> 01:37:34,641
She's good, she's just resting.

1098
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:36,807
Where's the Hudson?

1099
01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:38,516
Yeah.

1100
01:37:38,557 --> 01:37:42,224
Man, it's so beat I had to leave it on Market Street for the vultures.

1101
01:37:42,266 --> 01:37:43,266
Oh, shit.

1102
01:37:48,099 --> 01:37:48,807
And Marylou?

1103
01:37:48,849 --> 01:37:51,932
That dumb little box married one of her sailors.

1104
01:37:54,016 --> 01:37:57,405
And he's threatened to kill me if he finds me, so I'm gonna have to defend myself

1105
01:37:57,406 --> 01:37:59,782
and kill him and go to San Quentin for life.

1106
01:38:00,224 --> 01:38:01,807
That would be the end of me.

1107
01:38:01,849 --> 01:38:03,516
Oh, come on

1108
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:09,266
How's your ma?

1109
01:38:09,307 --> 01:38:12,016
Still waiting for that 15 bucks you owe her !

1110
01:38:14,724 --> 01:38:16,557
Yeah, one day...

1111
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,891
Guess what.

1112
01:38:18,891 --> 01:38:21,224
I'm gonna be a father again.

1113
01:38:21,266 --> 01:38:22,599
Really?

1114
01:38:22,641 --> 01:38:23,266
Yeah.

1115
01:38:23,307 --> 01:38:28,849
Sweet little Amy, she can stand alone for 30 seconds, she's 22 pounds and 29 inches long.

1116
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:32,847
And I found out that she's 31 one fourth percent English,

1117
01:38:32,848 --> 01:38:35,079
27 and a half percent German,

1118
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:38,479
27 percent Irish, 8 and three fourths percent Dutch,

1119
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,711
7 percent Scotch and one hundred percent wonderful.

1120
01:38:42,307 --> 01:38:43,849
Yes.

1121
01:38:59,557 --> 01:39:00,557
Hush.

1122
01:39:06,849 --> 01:39:08,391
Ahh, heebie jeebies !

1123
01:39:08,432 --> 01:39:11,057
We gotta find ourselves some kicks.

1124
01:39:20,099 --> 01:39:21,307
Sal's here.

1125
01:39:21,349 --> 01:39:22,724
I heard.

1126
01:39:24,891 --> 01:39:27,182
He wants to take me out to hear some music.

1127
01:39:27,224 --> 01:39:28,516
You wish to come?

1128
01:39:29,891 --> 01:39:32,182
Who's gonna stay here and take care of Amy?

1129
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,432
Alright then, I'll just go.

1130
01:39:45,849 --> 01:39:50,307
Dean, don't make yourself feel better by asking me along

1131
01:39:51,015 --> 01:39:52,432
I'll be back in a little bit.

1132
01:40:08,557 --> 01:40:09,099
Sal !

1133
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,474
By Marylou's cunt, it can't be !

1134
01:40:11,974 --> 01:40:12,599
What?

1135
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,839
That's 1.10 a ticket and a dime each for the jackets.

1136
01:40:18,265 --> 01:40:20,057

1137
01:40:20,099 --> 01:40:21,182

01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:23,474
Can I hear a sharooni mo' mo' mo' mo' mo'?

1139
01:40:23,515 --> 01:40:25,765

01:40:25,807 --> 01:40:26,974

Mo'!

1144
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,015
No way

1145
01:40:33,765 --> 01:40:34,599
Yip-rok!

1146
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,849
Hereesi!

1147
01:41:07,307 --> 01:41:10,599
Look at that, Slim knows time, Sal !

1148
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:11,432
He knows time !

1149
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:45,640
Thank you !

1150
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:50,974
But most important my sure-ooni mo' loves you !

1151
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:54,640
Goodness !

1152
01:41:54,682 --> 01:41:56,474
Oh my goodness !

1153
01:41:56,515 --> 01:41:58,370
You are the bee's knees.

1154
01:41:58,371 --> 01:42:01,434
Wanna take you home and wake up with fleas.

1155
01:42:01,435 --> 01:42:05,127
Please, say hello to my future ex-wife!

1156
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:29,099
Hey, Camille !

1157
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:31,640
Congratulations on the baby.

1158
01:42:31,724 --> 01:42:32,724
If you.

1159
01:42:32,807 --> 01:42:34,057
Sal, excuse me.

1160
01:42:34,099 --> 01:42:35,807
Dean, I need to talk to you.

1161
01:42:41,057 --> 01:42:42,307
I want you to get out.

1162
01:42:43,599 --> 01:42:44,349
Just go.

1163
01:42:44,349 --> 01:42:45,057
Just get out.

1164
01:42:45,099 --> 01:42:45,932
Now, honey...

1165
01:42:45,974 --> 01:42:46,390
No.

1166
01:42:46,432 --> 01:42:49,849
You said you were going to take care of us and you were done fooling around.

1167
01:42:53,265 --> 01:42:54,974
I know that look on your face, Dean.

1168
01:42:55,807 --> 01:42:56,765
You're bored.

1169
01:42:56,807 --> 01:43:01,015
You're sick of me, and you're sick of work, and the baby.

1170
01:43:01,057 --> 01:43:01,765
I wanna.

1171
01:43:01,807 --> 01:43:05,973
I just want you to take your friend and get out of my house.

1172
01:43:15,807 --> 01:43:17,682
Do you realize how much I've given up for you?

1173
01:43:41,432 --> 01:43:44,557
I never want you back.

1174
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,348
I never want to see you again !

1175
01:43:56,432 --> 01:43:58,015
I'll see you very soon, I promise.

1176
01:44:00,182 --> 01:44:01,807
Don't you dare lie to her, too.

1177
01:44:01,848 --> 01:44:02,973
You're a liar.

1178
01:44:02,973 --> 01:44:04,557
You're a liar.

1179
01:44:06,973 --> 01:44:09,973
Liar... Liar...

1180
01:45:24,682 --> 01:45:29,223
I realized as we racked our brains for where to go and what to do, that it was up to me.

1181
01:45:33,015 --> 01:45:37,140
I counted my money and showed it to Dean and said, "Come to New York (with me)."

1182
01:45:37,182 --> 01:45:39,348
"Let's go to Denver first," he said.

1183
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:42,890
"This time we must absolutely find my father, Sal!"

1184
01:45:47,557 --> 01:45:48,890
Your signature here...

1185
01:45:49,098 --> 01:45:52,057
We're taking the semi-pristine Chrysler to Kansas.

1186
01:45:52,265 --> 01:45:55,390
Along with yourselves, there's a nice young married couple.

1187
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:58,390
We share the gas expenses equally among the five of us.

1188
01:46:00,307 --> 01:46:01,973
Are we all copacetic on that score gentlemen?

1189
01:46:05,098 --> 01:46:06,057
Yeah.

1190
01:46:59,931 --> 01:47:00,723
Ola

1191
01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:09,806
I'm very glad you have accepted my invitation to a few drinks after that perilous journey.

1192
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:11,390
Ah, no problem, amigo.

1193
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:17,848
Thank you.

1194
01:47:23,931 --> 01:47:24,973
Hmm, whiskey

1195
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:36,723
I like young men like you.

1196
01:47:39,265 --> 01:47:42,223
You probably don't believe it, but, uh.

1197
01:47:44,515 --> 01:47:48,556
the truth is, I really don't like girls.

1198
01:47:48,598 --> 01:47:50,265
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

1199
01:47:50,306 --> 01:47:52,265
Excuse me.

1200
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:10,640
To tell you the straight deal, I sometimes had to survive the streets of Denver by working far into the night.

1201
01:48:12,598 --> 01:48:14,098
Yes, I can appreciate, uh...

1202
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:16,556
"Never leave a customer unsatisfied."

1203
01:48:16,598 --> 01:48:19,098
I had that tattooed on my ass.

1204
01:48:25,431 --> 01:48:28,973
Perhaps there will be some money involved...

1205
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:32,265
Oh, yeah?

1206
01:49:01,598 --> 01:49:02,181
Ah.

1207
01:49:02,223 --> 01:49:03,806
Ah.

1208
01:49:03,848 --> 01:49:04,848
Jesus !

1209
01:49:20,973 --> 01:49:23,473
Denver, Colorado

1210
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:42,181
You see?

1211
01:49:42,223 --> 01:49:44,848
You give them what they secretly want and they just panic.

1212
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:55,473
And here you go.

1213
01:49:55,515 --> 01:49:56,556
Club, extra mayo.

1214
01:49:56,598 --> 01:49:58,306
Enjoy.

1215
01:50:02,848 --> 01:50:04,889
Look, I did it for us, man.

1216
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,139
I got twenty bucks off the old fag.

1217
01:50:36,223 --> 01:50:39,264
My old man, a little guy, Moriarty.

1218
01:50:39,306 --> 01:50:41,139
Known in these parts as "the Barber".

1219
01:50:41,181 --> 01:50:42,848
"Moriarty"?

1220
01:50:42,889 --> 01:50:44,223
No.

1221
01:50:44,264 --> 01:50:45,639
Never heard of him.

1222
01:50:57,223 --> 01:50:58,264
Sorry, son.

1223
01:50:58,306 --> 01:51:00,139
I ain't seen your old man in.

1224
01:51:00,139 --> 01:51:01,723
I don't know how many years.

1225
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:45,723
New York, 1950

1226
01:51:54,723 --> 01:51:56,681
How long have we known each other?

1227
01:51:56,723 --> 01:51:58,139
5 years?

1228
01:51:58,181 --> 01:51:59,264
5 pretty good years.

1229
01:51:59,306 --> 01:52:00,389
Who are we now?

1230
01:52:00,473 --> 01:52:02,181
Who are we, yes?

1231
01:52:02,223 --> 01:52:03,098
Who are we now?

1232
01:52:03,139 --> 01:52:04,514
ah, a simple question.

1233
01:52:04,556 --> 01:52:06,139
Are you gonna tell us, Carlo?

1234
01:52:08,223 --> 01:52:09,264
I know I'm 23.

1235
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:16,556
I know that I rely on my friends and my family for money...

1236
01:52:16,598 --> 01:52:17,764
Ah, ah.

1237
01:52:17,806 --> 01:52:19,264
Join that club, please !

1238
01:52:19,306 --> 01:52:20,889
I know I will.

1239
01:52:20,889 --> 01:52:22,556
I know there's no gold at the end of the rainbow.

1240
01:52:24,098 --> 01:52:26,806
There's just shit and piss.

1241
01:52:26,848 --> 01:52:30,223
But to know that, that makes me free.

1242
01:53:13,639 --> 01:53:15,973
<i>You come in contact with social controls.</i>

1243
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:21,639
<i>With custom, with moral code, and with law.</i>

1244
01:53:21,723 --> 01:53:26,223
<i>The town or city in which you live has laws which control you.</i>

1245
01:53:26,264 --> 01:53:30,347
<i>There are state laws, and the federal government in your name...</i>

1246
01:53:46,097 --> 01:53:47,556
Mexico, huh?

1247
01:53:50,014 --> 01:53:52,222
Damn Sal, that's big

1248
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:54,931
You know, I've been thinking.

1249
01:53:56,306 --> 01:53:57,431
I've never been south.

1250
01:53:59,639 --> 01:54:02,431
Damn, Sal, I wish you weren't going.

1251
01:54:02,472 --> 01:54:05,972
It'll be my first timein ol' New York without my good boy.

1252
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:11,597
Shit, Sal.

1253
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:13,972
We haven't talked straight in a long time.

1254
01:54:16,681 --> 01:54:17,681
Yeah, I know.

1255
01:54:17,722 --> 01:54:19,181
Yeah.

1256
01:54:19,222 --> 01:54:20,597
You see, man.

1257
01:54:21,806 --> 01:54:24,806
The older you get, those troubles just keep piling on.

1258
01:54:32,431 --> 01:54:33,389
Look at this.

1259
01:54:37,681 --> 01:54:38,722
That's Joanie.

1260
01:54:40,056 --> 01:54:41,847
Look at that smile, too.

1261
01:54:41,889 --> 01:54:43,806
Ain't she gonna break some hearts

1262
01:54:43,806 --> 01:54:45,056
Yeah.

1263
01:54:47,222 --> 01:54:48,264
She's beautiful.

1264
01:54:54,681 --> 01:54:56,389
Did I tell you Marylou's pregnant?

1265
01:54:59,681 --> 01:55:02,264
Well if it speaks French-Canadian, it's a complete coincidence

1266
01:55:07,681 --> 01:55:09,139
(laughs) Shit

1267
01:55:16,347 --> 01:55:17,264
I'll leave you to it.

1268
01:55:20,389 --> 01:55:21,472
Thanks for the visit.

1269
01:55:22,847 --> 01:55:23,681
I'll write you.

1270
01:55:23,722 --> 01:55:25,431
I know you will.

1271
01:55:31,139 --> 01:55:32,014
Take care buddy.

1272
01:55:32,056 --> 01:55:32,847
Go get 'em !

1273
01:55:41,597 --> 01:55:42,306
Hey, Sal !

1274
01:55:43,764 --> 01:55:46,431
Now you know I habla la espanol, don't you?

1275
01:56:11,347 --> 01:56:12,722
La Estrella, Mexico

1276
01:56:20,597 --> 01:56:21,139
Gracias

1277
01:56:21,681 --> 01:56:22,889
Sir, sir !

1278
01:56:22,972 --> 01:56:23,889
Do you like it?

1279
01:56:23,931 --> 01:56:24,972
60 pesos.

1280
01:56:26,181 --> 01:56:26,972
No, gracias.

1281
01:56:28,556 --> 01:56:29,139
Hey kid !

1282
01:56:29,222 --> 01:56:31,389
You got any marijuana?

1283
01:56:31,431 --> 01:56:32,722
Marijuana?

1284
01:56:32,764 --> 01:56:33,389
Si.

1285
01:56:33,431 --> 01:56:34,347
Si si si.

1286
01:56:51,472 --> 01:56:54,556
Those are my brothers, my sister and my grandmother too.

1287
01:56:57,681 --> 01:56:58,806
Well, shit.

1288
01:57:22,097 --> 01:57:24,555
Your 'ma could learn a few lessons from this kid's grandma.

1289
01:57:26,597 --> 01:57:27,555
A man of word !

1290
01:57:31,805 --> 01:57:32,514
Victor.

1291
01:57:33,597 --> 01:57:37,014
This is the biggest bomber of tea I have ever smoked

1292
01:57:40,847 --> 01:57:41,930
What's his name?

1293
01:57:43,264 --> 01:57:44,055
Thomas.

1294
01:57:46,847 --> 01:57:47,805
Thomas.

1295
01:57:47,847 --> 01:57:48,639
Thomas.

1296
01:57:53,305 --> 01:57:54,055
(In car)Thomas?...

1297
01:58:08,597 --> 01:58:09,930

CLUB OWNER Do you like girls?

1301
01:59:42,805 --> 01:59:50,014
Mucho, mucho loveMexico City is the holy place for more !

1302
01:59:51,805 --> 01:59:52,389
You're the best.

1303
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:52,889
Gracias.

1304
01:59:52,930 --> 01:59:53,472
Thank you.

1305
01:59:58,430 --> 01:59:59,680
Look at this traffic, Sal !

1306
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:01,097
Everybody just goes !

1307
02:00:04,514 --> 02:00:05,722
Dig those faces.

1308
02:00:05,764 --> 02:00:07,305
I want to be one of them !

1309
02:00:13,097 --> 02:00:13,930
Now we gotta eat this.

1310
02:00:21,639 --> 02:00:22,264
.How much?

1311
02:00:22,305 --> 02:00:27,139
We've got so much, we're rich !

1312
02:00:36,472 --> 02:00:37,805
They look just like us.

1313
02:00:37,847 --> 02:00:38,888
See, they're brothers !

1314
02:00:44,805 --> 02:00:47,597
My brother, I can smell the marijuana !

1315
02:00:48,972 --> 02:00:49,763
Yes !

1316
02:01:16,555 --> 02:01:22,013
Voyager, c'est bien utile, ga fait travailler l'imagination.

1317
02:01:22,055 --> 02:01:25,305
Tout le reste n'est que deceptions et fatigues.

1318
02:01:25,305 --> 02:01:27,847
Prends soin de ta mere.

1319
02:01:27,847 --> 02:01:32,430
To the good, old, dead, demented men we love.

1320
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:33,930
Voila sa force.

1321
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:35,847
Il va de la vie a la mort.

1322
02:01:35,847 --> 02:01:36,597
To the West.

1323
02:01:36,597 --> 02:01:38,680
To the West.

1324
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:39,847
"You got no calluses, Sal."

1325
02:01:41,305 --> 02:01:43,347
C'est un moment...

1326
02:01:46,722 --> 02:01:47,972
Notre voyage a nous est entierement imaginaire.

1327
02:01:48,013 --> 02:01:49,763
"(indistinct dialogue, baby crying) C'est oublie!

1328
02:01:49,805 --> 02:01:50,847
I've never been able to kill myself.

1329
02:01:50,888 --> 02:01:53,388
I am at your immediate disposal.

1330
02:01:53,388 --> 02:01:54,888
Immediate disposal.

1331
02:01:54,930 --> 02:01:58,513
Because you've crushed all the poetry you had in you.

1332
02:01:58,555 --> 02:02:04,513
Take a close look at yourself and the degree of rottenness you've come to.

1333
02:02:05,763 --> 02:02:07,555
You can't deny the blood guilt.

1334
02:02:07,597 --> 02:02:08,847
You 're white.

1335
02:02:08,888 --> 02:02:10,222
White!

1336
02:02:10,263 --> 02:02:12,180
White

1337
02:02:27,138 --> 02:02:28,805
Poor Sal got sick.

1338
02:02:28,847 --> 02:02:30,180
Poor Sal got sick.

1339
02:02:32,638 --> 02:02:34,180
Dysentery, man.

1340
02:02:37,472 --> 02:02:39,972
Now listen if you can hear in your sickness, my boy.

1341
02:02:40,055 --> 02:02:44,305
I got my divorce with Camille down here, and I gotta get back if the car can hold up.

1342
02:02:46,305 --> 02:02:47,305
Not that again.

1343
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:51,430
All that again, good buddy.

1344
02:02:51,472 --> 02:02:52,638
I've got to get back to my life.

1345
02:02:53,805 --> 02:02:55,222
Wish I didn't have to go.

1346
02:03:09,222 --> 02:03:10,847
Yes, yes, yes.

1347
02:03:10,888 --> 02:03:12,888
I gotta go now, ol' fever Sal.

1348
02:03:18,138 --> 02:03:19,055
Goodbye.

1349
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:08,555
Ozone Park, 1951

1350
02:04:17,721 --> 02:04:18,263
Humm.

1351
02:04:18,305 --> 02:04:19,513
Pour toi.

1352
02:04:22,471 --> 02:04:23,221
Merci.

1353
02:04:33,971 --> 02:04:36,768
(Book title) Denver Doldrums- For S.P. and D.M.

1354
02:04:36,768 --> 02:04:39,614
the secret heroes of these poems - Poems by Carlo Marx

1355
02:04:47,263 --> 02:04:53,786
I would rather go mad, gone down the track to Mexico, heroin dripping in my veins,

1356
02:04:53,787 --> 02:05:02,290
eyes and ears full of marijuana, eating the god Peyote on the floor of a mudhut on the border...

1357
02:05:02,888 --> 02:05:08,283
rather jar my body down the road, crying by a diner in the Western sun;

1358
02:05:08,284 --> 02:05:19,522
rather crawl on my naked belly over tincans in Cincinnati; rather drag a rotten railroad tieto a Golgotha in the Rockies;

1359
02:05:19,523 --> 02:05:25,561
rather crowned with thorns in Galveston; nailed hand and foot in Los Angeles;

1360
02:05:25,562 --> 02:05:30,536
raised up to die in Denver; pierced in the side in Chicago;

1361
02:05:30,537 --> 02:05:37,561
perished and tombed in New Orleans; and resurrected somewhere on Garret Mountain.

1362
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:48,638
December, 1951

1363
02:05:56,971 --> 02:05:57,846
(at a distance, to a woman) Hey.

1364
02:06:10,388 --> 02:06:11,013
Sal?

1365
02:06:13,846 --> 02:06:15,013
Is that you, man?

1366
02:06:18,096 --> 02:06:19,221
(to his friends, very low) Hang on a minute.

1367
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:35,930
What are you doing in New York, man?

1368
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:40,263
Dear Sal...

1369
02:06:42,971 --> 02:06:45,180
I came on the railroad pass.

1370
02:06:45,221 --> 02:06:47,013
Old hard bench coaches.

1371
02:06:48,263 --> 02:06:49,971
Crossing railroads.

1372
02:06:50,055 --> 02:06:56,805
Long, long awful trip, five days and nights, just to see you, Sal.

1373
02:06:59,346 --> 02:07:00,096
Are you alright?

1374
02:07:02,471 --> 02:07:03,388
How's Camille?

1375
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:05,346
How are the babies?

1376
02:07:22,388 --> 02:07:25,805
(then reading)"Dear Dean, Its the end of the first half of the century.

1377
02:07:25,846 --> 02:07:29,929
Welcome with love and kisses to spend the other half with us.

1378
02:07:32,888 --> 02:07:34,054
We all wait for you.

1379
02:07:34,054 --> 02:07:36,971
Camille, Amy and little Joanie."

1380
02:07:37,013 --> 02:07:39,263
That's great

1381
02:07:39,263 --> 02:07:39,846
Yeah.

1382
02:07:50,138 --> 02:07:56,388
We still haven't talked of Mexico, and us leaving, and the fever of last year.

1383
02:07:56,429 --> 02:07:57,138
But we don't...

1384
02:07:57,179 --> 02:07:58,638
Hey Sal, we gotta go, man !

1385
02:07:59,429 --> 02:08:01,679
We don't have to talk about that right now.

1386
02:08:01,721 --> 02:08:02,304
No.

1387
02:08:03,429 --> 02:08:04,096
Hey.

1388
02:08:04,138 --> 02:08:06,138
Hey Sal, for Christ's sake.

1389
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:08,388
Duke Ellington ain't gonna wait

1390
02:08:08,804 --> 02:08:10,054
Yeah, just give me a minute, Remi !

1391
02:08:10,096 --> 02:08:12,221
They're all waiting.

1392
02:08:13,596 --> 02:08:14,263
Do you think.

1393
02:08:14,304 --> 02:08:16,971
you can give me a ride to East 14th?

1394
02:08:16,971 --> 02:08:21,304
I want to spend as much time with my boy as possible, you know.

1395
02:08:23,304 --> 02:08:26,388
Man, I wish we didn't have tickets to this concert.

1396
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:30,721
Yeah.

1397
02:08:49,179 --> 02:08:50,263
Bye, Dean.

1398
02:08:59,763 --> 02:09:00,471
Hey, Sal !

1399
02:09:05,096 --> 02:09:06,179
I love you as ever.

1400
02:10:24,096 --> 02:10:31,471
I first met Dean not long after my father died...

1401
02:10:34,221 --> 02:10:35,929
(singing) Oh I got a pretty little girl...

1402
02:10:35,929 --> 02:10:39,388
Dean, I'll be goddamned!

1403
02:10:39,388 --> 02:10:40,554
You're early...

1404
02:10:40,554 --> 02:10:40,971
Yeah, well...

1405
02:10:40,971 --> 02:10:43,221
around my finger...

1406
02:10:43,221 --> 02:10:44,929
I was in reform school all the time.

1407
02:10:45,763 --> 02:10:48,554
I was like a young punk asserting myself......

1408
02:10:54,346 --> 02:10:57,513
and she stands on her head and she does the splits......

1409
02:10:57,554 --> 02:10:59,387
"I need your cock!

1410
02:10:59,429 --> 02:11:03,887
"The only people that interest me are the mad ones...

1411
02:11:03,887 --> 02:11:05,971
Mad to live, mad to talk...

1412
02:11:10,012 --> 02:11:12,012
<i>... the West coast and come crashing down to earth...</i>

1413
02:11:12,054 --> 02:11:15,304
And the sound of the wild...

1414
02:11:15,346 --> 02:11:16,471
Bless me, Father, for I will sin

1415
02:11:16,512 --> 02:11:17,471
Man, I just love women!

1416
02:11:17,512 --> 02:11:18,637
I just want a house...

1417
02:11:18,679 --> 02:11:19,554
Ah, shit, Dean!

1418
02:11:19,554 --> 02:11:19,887
a baby.

1419
02:11:19,929 --> 02:11:20,471
Sal.

1420
02:11:20,512 --> 02:11:22,137
I've come to ask you to teach me how to write.

1421
02:11:22,179 --> 02:11:29,283
(singing)And it's hard, ain't it hard, to love what you kill

1422
02:11:29,283 --> 02:11:30,098
That Hudson goes!

1423
02:11:39,926 --> 02:11:40,641
Hey, Sal !

1424
02:11:46,379 --> 02:11:49,813
I love you as ever.

1425
02:12:02,962 --> 02:12:10,587
So in America, when the sun goes down and I sit on the old, broken-down river pier, watching the long long skies over New Jersey,

1426
02:12:10,587 --> 02:12:16,046
and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over to the West coast,

1427
02:12:16,087 --> 02:12:23,046
and all of that road going, and all the people dreaming in the immensity of it,

1428
02:12:23,046 --> 02:12:28,296
and in Iowa I know by now that the evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,

1429
02:12:28,296 --> 02:12:32,746
which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the Earth,

1430
02:12:32,747 --> 02:12:37,372
darkens all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in,

1431
02:12:37,407 --> 02:12:40,770
and nobody, nobody knows what is going to happen to anybody,

1432
02:12:40,771 --> 02:12:44,207
besides the forlorn rags of growing old,

1433
02:12:45,212 --> 02:12:50,285
I think of Dean Moriarty, I even think of old Dean Moriarty, the father we never found,

1434
02:12:51,331 --> 02:12:55,657
I think of Dean Moriarty, I think of Dean Moriarty.

1435
02:13:15,796 --> 02:13:16,546
Can you hear me now?

1436
02:13:19,421 --> 02:13:20,421
But anyway...

1437
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:25,754
Tonight also, I wrote a song, called "On the Road".

1438
02:13:26,885 --> 02:13:29,921
I'm just rather reading what I wrote all night.

1439
02:13:29,962 --> 02:13:32,837
There are better things coming than what I wrote all night.

1440
02:13:32,879 --> 02:13:38,087
Straight from the mind to the voice, with no hand intervening.

1441
02:13:38,129 --> 02:13:45,754
(singing) I left New York, 1949To go across the country without a dad-blame dime.

1442
02:13:45,754 --> 02:13:56,962
Montana in the cold, cold fall Found my father in the gambling hallFather, Father where have you been?

1443
02:13:57,004 --> 02:14:00,587
You've been in the world since I was a teen.

1444
02:14:03,712 --> 02:14:10,671
Dear son, he said, don't worry about me I'm about to die of pleurisy

1445
02:14:14,296 --> 02:14:20,087
Cross the Mississippi, cross the Tennessee Cross the Niagara,

1446
02:14:20,129 --> 02:14:21,837
home I'll never be.

1447
02:14:21,879 --> 02:14:29,504
Home in Ol'Medora, home in Ol' Truckee Apalachicola, home I'll never be.

1448
02:14:29,545 --> 02:14:36,754
For better or worse, through thick and thinLike being married to the little woman.

1449
02:14:36,795 --> 02:14:45,045
God loved me just like I loved himI want you do the same just for him.

1450
02:14:45,087 --> 02:14:49,295
The worms eat away but don't worry, watch the wind.

1451
02:14:49,337 --> 02:14:52,212
The worms eat away but don't worry watch the wind.

1452
02:14:54,564 --> 02:14:58,033
So I left Montana on an ol'freight train

1453
02:14:58,034 --> 02:15:01,597
The night my father died in the cold, cold rain.

1454
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:09,480
Rode up to Opelousas, rode to Wounded Knee, Rode to Ogallala, home I'll never be.

1455
02:15:09,515 --> 02:15:11,614
Home I'll never be.

1456
02:15:11,615 --> 02:20:12,615
ON THE ROAD
