Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:38,952
I work in the commercial...

3
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:41,463
advertising industry.
I'm a commercial director.

4
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:43,856
Fairly successful.

5
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:46,468
What am I saying?
I'm really successful.

6
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:48,471
My commercials win awards in Europe.

7
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,507
Well, enough about me.

8
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,806
Before, I used to work with
my friend. Charlie.

9
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:57,369
I'm in New York for business...

10
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:59,780
just overnight, so I'll go meet him.

11
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:03,446
Charlie's gay.

12
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:05,914
Well, I'm not gay.

13
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:07,890
Charlie is gay. But...

14
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:11,291
and he recently found out
that he's HIV positive.

15
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:14,996
We haven't seen each other in 5 years.

16
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:16,589
I live in Los Angeles.

17
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:19,124
He lives in New York.
I'll tell you...

18
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:22,138
when we were in New York together...

19
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:24,072
we hung... I mean...

20
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:25,404
we had...

21
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:28,070
then I was considered the most
promising director...

22
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:29,635
in the lower east side.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,669
Well...

24
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:35,080
anyway, I still consider him
my best friend.

25
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,350
Five years ago
we had a big fight and...

26
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:41,185
over a work thing and...

27
00:01:42,192 --> 00:01:44,592
we haven't spoken since, you know?

28
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:48,829
Stupid, it's just so stupid.

29
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:52,026
But you know how pride can be...

30
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,329
he didn't call me to tell me
that he was sick.

31
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:56,896
His lover calls me.

32
00:01:59,009 --> 00:01:59,998
Anyway...

33
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:02,771
so, I'm a little nervous.

34
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:05,641
We'll see how it goes.

35
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:21,746
Okay, now, now accelerate
out of that move.

36
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:23,715
Okay, good.

37
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:07,359
- How's it going?
- Good.

38
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:10,502
- How's I.A.?
- It's all right.

39
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,202
You married a model.
Drive a Porsche.

40
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:14,972
No. I don't drive a Porsche.

41
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,015
You hanging around, max?

42
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:58,583
Kevin is an alarmist, by the way.

43
00:04:58,621 --> 00:04:59,781
Everything's fine.

44
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:02,758
Nothing's happened, yet.
Nothing may happen.

45
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:08,495
Nobody knows anything,
so if you don't mind not...

46
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,793
telling anybody else because...

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,989
Charlie.

48
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:13,934
If you need anything...

49
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,001
like what?

50
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:19,973
Like, you know...

51
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,171
I know that there'll be
medical bills and, and stuff.

52
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:27,706
Medical bills. Okay.
So, what do I need?

53
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,353
You need some help. Some...

54
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,151
money.

55
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,522
I've good insurance.
I don't need your guilt money.

56
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,891
You make it hard.

57
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:47,494
- You make it hard.
- Where's your sense of humor?

58
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:49,732
This is New York.
We got it here.

59
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:50,932
That's all we have.

60
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:56,906
Still in the closet?

61
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,250
Are you out or in?

62
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:06,051
- Out of what?
- Are you hiding? Or are you...

63
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,580
- with it?
- When'll you get the point?

64
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,092
Why do you hang around me?

65
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:11,491
You're getting close to the source.

66
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,496
Never. Ever.

67
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,522
- "Ever, never, never."
- Never. That's right.

68
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:20,502
I am caught into the nappy
dugout and I am staying there.

69
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:21,697
That's right.

70
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:25,139
So defensive! "homophobic"
is what we call that right now.

71
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,467
- I'm not being defensive.
- How's your beard?

72
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,772
- I'm not being defensive!
- Your wife?

73
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:30,540
How is your beard-wife?

74
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,282
- I have pictures.
- Come on.

75
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:36,342
Let's see the pictures.

76
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,617
You have a family.

77
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:42,249
This is Mimi.

78
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,294
And my daughter saffron.

79
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,496
She's beautiful.

80
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,064
And this...

81
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:55,664
this is Charlie.

82
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:11,475
Wow. Thanks.

83
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:19,927
I may need money.

84
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:23,259
Probably. I'll let you know.

85
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,435
You do that.

86
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,697
You got it.

87
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,709
This girl is costing
us a million dollars.

88
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,217
With all those helicopter shots...

89
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:44,913
I don't want helicopters.

90
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:46,421
And this Claudia Schiffer.

91
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:48,219
What's her price?

92
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,555
She's too white.
She's too Aryan.

93
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:54,085
No, she's not Aryan.
She's from Germany.

94
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,154
Shut up.

95
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:58,264
We have an open call.
Bring me everybody.

96
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,268
New faces.

97
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:01,793
You like any of these women?

98
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:04,306
You want to bring in
a bunch more.

99
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,808
It would be really helpful if...

100
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:08,674
Cindy Crawford.

101
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:11,441
She works with herb enough.

102
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:14,817
And also, max,
talk to me about...

103
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,819
collections.
The fall collections.

104
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:19,219
Give me.

105
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,689
The cigarette?

106
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:24,293
Give. Give.

107
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,061
Bad. Bad.

108
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,790
He doesn't want to smoke.

109
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:31,658
What time is check-out
in the morning?

110
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:33,694
12:00. but we must...

111
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:37,194
be at the airport at 2:00
and there's that...

112
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,471
un-convention thing, so...

113
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,670
I'm going to bed.

114
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:46,672
Look! There's Christian Slater.

115
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:51,253
I like New York.

116
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:52,845
Do you like New York?

117
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,322
Good night. Take care.

118
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:58,894
I'll come in then.

119
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:01,226
Why?

120
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:02,822
To relax with you and...

121
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,426
no?

122
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:07,834
- Good night.
- Good night.

123
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,098
Good morning, New York.
This is your traffic report.

124
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:18,580
Stay out of your cars.
The east side's a mess.

125
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:21,208
Welcome to the united nations
celebration.

126
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:23,813
Thank you, Mr. Sandpiper.

127
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,788
Join us again soon.
Sorry about the plumbing. Next.

128
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:29,986
- You're quite busy.
- It's the un celebration, sir.

129
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:33,553
50 years of the un
and what do you get? Chaos.

130
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:35,063
The airport, sir?

131
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,726
Leave one hour at least.
The traffic is really bad.

132
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,735
You better ring my friends.

133
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,031
905, 906, 907.

134
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,662
The van wyck is extra heavy
this morning.

135
00:09:42,705 --> 00:09:47,233
An overturned tractor tailor
carrying dry goods.

136
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,172
Westbound L.I.E. Is backed up
from van dam to queens midtown.

137
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:26,408
2 toll booths are out
due to construction.

138
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:30,044
Take the 59th street bridge.

139
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:17,295
You have a black heart.

140
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:20,935
On you.
Think maybe your pen.

141
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,959
Your shirt.

142
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,198
Oh, shit.

143
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:27,573
Goodness. Hold on.

144
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,949
Thank you.

145
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:40,288
You should change clothes.

146
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:44,020
I already checked out hotel
so I've blown that one.

147
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:50,095
That's closed.

148
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:56,427
Max.

149
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:57,963
Karen.

150
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:00,631
Nice to meet you.

151
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,906
The bathroom's over there.

152
00:12:12,788 --> 00:12:13,777
Shit.

153
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,456
Sorry for the mess.

154
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:18,926
What mess?

155
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:30,133
No, I just got in.

156
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:32,941
It went well.

157
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,944
Are we still on for tonight?

158
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:36,967
I didn't.

159
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:39,573
There's such a thing
as a wake-up call!

160
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:41,549
Shut up. What are you doing?

161
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:50,125
You know these guys.
It's something that...

162
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,717
whatever.

163
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:52,955
I'll call you back.

164
00:12:56,265 --> 00:12:58,256
Thank you.
That was very kind.

165
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:01,168
I appreciate it.
Is everything okay?

166
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:03,034
- Not bad news?
- That was my girlfriend.

167
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:04,539
We were going to
a concert tonight.

168
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:08,339
- Now she can't make it.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

169
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,545
What was the concert?

170
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,446
Heavy stuff. String quartet.

171
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:16,383
The Julliard quartet.

172
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:18,944
I'm psychic.

173
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:23,419
Actually, I read the review
in the times yesterday.

174
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,586
I also saw the tickets
on the sink there.

175
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:27,562
You like the Julliard?

176
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:31,293
Brilliant. I tried to buy some
tickets but they were sold out.

177
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:33,561
I'm jealous.

178
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,338
You'll still go, though, right?

179
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:37,669
Yes. I'm still going.

180
00:13:37,707 --> 00:13:40,073
- Good.
- I can sell the other ticket.

181
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:41,576
Without a doubt.

182
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,009
Absolutely.

183
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:44,910
You're leaving town, right?

184
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:46,107
On my way right now.

185
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:50,077
Well, thank you very much.

186
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,677
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

187
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:53,621
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

188
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,413
Did my friends
already check out?

189
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:27,047
I thought you'd left, sir.

190
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,647
- Where?
- They were in a hurry.

191
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:31,524
I told them you'd gone to
the airport. A minute ago.

192
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,187
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye, sir.

193
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:38,491
Excuse me, my friend.
Is it possible?

194
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,936
We're blocked up
for 2 blocks around at least.

195
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:21,871
Sorry, there's nothing I can do
about it. I'm sorry.

196
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,469
So?

197
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:26,481
We're blocked up
for 25 or 30 minutes.

198
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:27,539
I don't know what to do.

199
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,051
25 or 30 minutes?

200
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,316
God. Geez.

201
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,488
There's no way
I'll get you there on time.

202
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:38,657
What about the Williamsburg?

203
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:43,393
We can't get to the Williamsburg
'cause we got a parade...

204
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:45,900
so we won't go
to the Williamsburg.

205
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:49,268
The midtown tunnel's
a few seconds away.

206
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:50,932
After that, we cruise.

207
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:52,873
I don't know how long
this'll take.

208
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:56,878
- No, that's okay.
- You want to wait?

209
00:15:56,912 --> 00:15:58,072
No, I don't think so.

210
00:15:58,114 --> 00:16:02,517
Maybe I'll try to find
another street or something.

211
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:03,950
Thanks a lot, anyway.

212
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:26,473
I love this song.

213
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:29,910
You like this?

214
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:32,454
You have me figured as a purist.

215
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:35,190
Well...

216
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:36,521
maybe.

217
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:41,385
Two more.

218
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:52,462
Can we smoke?

219
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,180
Here you go.

220
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,115
So what?

221
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:03,413
You guys from I.A.?

222
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:15,888
I thought you said
you were from I.A.

223
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:18,126
I wasn't going to tell him.

224
00:21:20,202 --> 00:21:21,601
Does it show?

225
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:26,699
May I have one of those?

226
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:31,535
Sure.

227
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:48,819
So, did you check into
another hotel?

228
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:20,893
So? I mean,
what is with this accent?

229
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,829
Is it french? Is it...?

230
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:25,493
You hear my accent.

231
00:22:25,534 --> 00:22:27,502
Yeah. It's dutch, Holland?

232
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:29,401
You guessed right. German.

233
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:30,427
German.

234
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,738
Right.

235
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:35,242
I came to school over here.

236
00:22:35,277 --> 00:22:37,074
I never went back.

237
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:38,579
You maintained the accent.

238
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:41,412
- It's something else.
- You have a light?

239
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,747
Sure.

240
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:46,210
Give me your fucking money.

241
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:48,712
Okay.

242
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,156
Give me your fucking wallet, man.

243
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:51,659
- Don't hurt him.
- You can have the money.

244
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:53,684
- Your wallet.
- Please don't hurt him.

245
00:22:53,729 --> 00:22:55,720
The money's in my pocket.

246
00:22:55,764 --> 00:22:57,391
Do what he says. It'll be okay

247
00:22:57,432 --> 00:22:58,626
come on. All right?

248
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,294
Here's the money.

249
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:02,360
- Be cool.
- Get them fucking beads.

250
00:23:02,404 --> 00:23:04,565
Give me!

251
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,403
Give me your beads!

252
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:07,908
Please don't hurt him.

253
00:23:07,943 --> 00:23:11,106
- Don't do that! Take the beads.
- Charlie! Nice tits.

254
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:13,273
- Maybe I should fuck your wife.
- Stop!

255
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:20,377
Kiss me? Get off.

256
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:24,687
- I'll cut your hands off.
- It's okay.

257
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:27,024
I'll cut you. Get out of here.

258
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm sorry.

259
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,987
Run. Run. Run.

260
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:35,096
Are you all right?

261
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:40,096
You all right?

262
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,472
It's over.

263
00:23:44,513 --> 00:23:46,344
Let's get this.

264
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:51,942
Goddamn New York.

265
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,120
We got a robbery suspect.
Male Hispanic.

266
00:24:01,363 --> 00:24:03,388
Wait. You want to report it?

267
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,391
If you want to,
they're right here.

268
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,395
No. Come on.

269
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:20,509
You'll be all right?

270
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,886
In a while. I'll feel better.

271
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:28,389
My heart's beating real fast, still.

272
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:31,756
Do you want to go to bed?

273
00:24:32,928 --> 00:24:34,361
I mean, you...

274
00:24:34,396 --> 00:24:36,921
- I know what you mean.
- You know what I mean.

275
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:40,432
No, not yet.

276
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:44,098
Would you like me to sit
with you for a while?

277
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:04,552
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

278
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:06,383
Bless you.

279
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:23,870
Do you want one?

280
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:34,081
Thanks.

281
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,930
Here's to life.

282
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:53,430
To life.

283
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:03,874
When do you have
to be at JFK?

284
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:06,876
8:00.

285
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:15,419
You can take the other bed.

286
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:16,931
No, that's okay.

287
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:20,264
- Why?
- No, really. I'm going to go.

288
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:21,564
Where will you go?

289
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:25,403
To JFK.

290
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:45,416
Listen, you just saved my life.

291
00:26:47,095 --> 00:26:49,461
We're both adults.
We're both married.

292
00:26:49,498 --> 00:26:50,760
It's the least I can do.

293
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,431
I'd like you to stay.

294
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:18,723
I set the alarm.

295
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:21,889
See you in the morning.

296
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,371
Don't let it shock you.

297
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:31,303
Maximilian!

298
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:33,239
I'm sorry I'm late.

299
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:35,606
- It's okay.
- Traffic was terrible.

300
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:39,413
Where are the kids?

301
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:41,438
At home.
I wanted to come by myself.

302
00:32:42,117 --> 00:32:44,585
- Well, shall I drive?
- Yeah. Sure.

303
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:45,608
Oh, good. Great.

304
00:32:46,454 --> 00:32:48,945
Bad boy, staying an extra night.

305
00:32:57,465 --> 00:32:59,797
Everything was fine at gram's?

306
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:02,200
Yeah, everything's really good.

307
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:04,398
Right. Good.

308
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,230
What is that smell?

309
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:09,376
Do you smell it?

310
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,379
It's like there's sharp and sour...

311
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:15,075
wasn't in the car before.

312
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:16,378
What is that?

313
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:17,907
I don't know.

314
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,083
It's the cologne
I got from the plane.

315
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:26,393
You know that
cheap shower substitute.

316
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:27,917
It always... loud.

317
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,158
Poor max.

318
00:33:30,198 --> 00:33:33,395
Must've been really bad
not having a bed to sleep in.

319
00:33:33,434 --> 00:33:35,902
No, it was okay.

320
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:37,928
I'll sleep better tonight.
That's for sure.

321
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,840
I wouldn't count on it, tiger!

322
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,934
Don't!

323
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:45,241
Mimi, don't do that!

324
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,077
We could have been killed here.

325
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:48,605
Warn me the next time
you do that.

326
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:52,920
Chill out, honey.
Just a little tweak.

327
00:33:52,954 --> 00:33:55,115
I just miss Mr. Puffinstuff.

328
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:03,864
We're here?

329
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:05,889
Is anybody home?

330
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:08,860
Yuck, don't kiss me.

331
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:10,370
I can. I brought you in this world.

332
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:12,896
Come here, you. I'll kiss you.
Good to see you.

333
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:19,903
- You like it?
- Yeah. It's good.

334
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:23,043
Too spicy for you?

335
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:25,742
Nope. It's fine.

336
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:28,347
It's from that
new place in the mall.

337
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,790
- I thought tonight was special.
- Tonight is special?

338
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:34,920
Now, see, mommy's
very thoughtful, huh?

339
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,920
What's thoughtful?

340
00:34:37,932 --> 00:34:39,923
A thought, dumbbell.

341
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:42,592
No violence against women.

342
00:34:42,637 --> 00:34:43,763
Remember?

343
00:34:43,805 --> 00:34:46,035
You have to sleep at night.
Trust me.

344
00:34:50,945 --> 00:34:53,914
You'll think I'm stupid,
but last night...

345
00:34:53,948 --> 00:34:55,415
after I got your message,

346
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,908
I couldn't stop thinking about
New York and how violent it is.

347
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:00,887
I imagined you being mugged.

348
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:03,854
No, come on.

349
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:05,358
How silly.

350
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:07,384
See, and here
I am safe and sound.

351
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,897
Come on.

352
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:13,628
- Oscar.
- Come on.

353
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:15,795
Oscar, get out of there. What?

354
00:35:15,837 --> 00:35:17,737
What do you smell on daddy?

355
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:22,533
- Oscar?
- Go to your bowl.

356
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,477
What is it, boy?

357
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:26,571
- Wonder what he smells on you?
- Cut it out.

358
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:28,609
Oscar's getting kind of funky.

359
00:35:29,984 --> 00:35:31,884
Maybe he doesn't like the cologne.

360
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,216
The dog has taste.

361
00:35:33,254 --> 00:35:34,243
Right?

362
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:40,383
I should just go upstairs
and take a shower.

363
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:43,158
- No, honey. Eat.
- I know how to take a hint.

364
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:45,665
Because you smell
doesn't mean anything.

365
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,292
It's a everyday thing.

366
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:50,927
Joke's on dad.

367
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:07,085
Those were big news
at the un's fiftieth birthday.

368
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:08,315
Motorcades came.

369
00:36:08,356 --> 00:36:12,053
Motorcades went.
Motorcades backed up...

370
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:14,357
leaving New Yorkers wondering...

371
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,625
who was sitting behind
the tinted windows.

372
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,249
Oscar out!

373
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,398
What do you thinks
bugging Oscar?

374
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:56,596
Hell if I know.

375
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,874
Maybe he's trying
to tell me something.

376
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:07,211
Maybe he smells
another bitch on you.

377
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,381
Is that possible?

378
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:21,888
I must tell you something.

379
00:37:30,405 --> 00:37:31,770
You'll hate me.

380
00:37:31,806 --> 00:37:33,068
I know what you'll tell me.

381
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:38,902
Was it just once?

382
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,914
Was it more than once?

383
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:48,912
You've been smoking, right?

384
00:37:52,427 --> 00:37:54,088
Oscar's not stupid, max.

385
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:56,887
He can smell it on you.

386
00:37:56,931 --> 00:37:57,920
So can I.

387
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:06,139
The smoke police'll have
to watch you night and day.

388
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:07,698
Huh, Mr. Sinner?

389
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:13,707
Let's go to bed.

390
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:17,513
Almost. Almost.

391
00:38:17,552 --> 00:38:19,918
Honey, circles. Circles.

392
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:21,216
That feels good.

393
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,985
Slower. Come on, slower.

394
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:26,619
Oh, yeah, gentle. That's it.

395
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:27,650
Harder.

396
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:29,555
I'm getting there.

397
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,124
Yes. Come on, baby.

398
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:36,295
I'm almost going to come.

399
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:39,738
Almost going to come.
Oh, yes. Honey.

400
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:44,143
No, no, hold still.
Hold still. Yeah. Hold still.

401
00:38:44,946 --> 00:38:46,345
Hold still.

402
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:51,384
Oh, my god, yes.

403
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:52,579
I'm coming.

404
00:38:54,555 --> 00:38:56,648
Squeeze my breasts.
Squeeze them.

405
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:57,680
Squeeze them.

406
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:04,729
Honey, honey.

407
00:39:04,765 --> 00:39:06,596
You'll wake the kids.

408
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:08,727
Fuck the kids!

409
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:10,964
I'm coming. I'm coming.

410
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,371
Was it good for you?

411
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:23,543
Fantastic.

412
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:28,385
How about you?

413
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:30,880
The best.

414
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:35,384
Honey?

415
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:37,386
I'm sorry.

416
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:42,391
You okay?

417
00:39:43,404 --> 00:39:44,564
I'm all right.

418
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:49,565
I'm sorry.

419
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,911
I like to rough you up.

420
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:00,920
I bought a video.

421
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:03,913
What kind of video?

422
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:06,916
Guide to lovemaking.

423
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,422
I just thought maybe
we could try something new.

424
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:20,430
You want to watch some tonight?

425
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:25,936
Jesus. What'd you do
last night? Is that a bruise?

426
00:40:26,948 --> 00:40:27,937
It's ink.

427
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:30,105
Ink?

428
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:37,447
It's from my pen.
See, ink bled from my pen.

429
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,421
It's... okay.

430
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:45,955
You've got a black heart.

431
00:40:58,479 --> 00:40:59,468
Good night.

432
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,520
Smoking will kill you.

433
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:21,925
Smoking will kill you.

434
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:26,837
Smoking will kill you.

435
00:41:26,874 --> 00:41:28,603
D-m-z productions,
can I help you?

436
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:34,778
Max, how's it going?

437
00:41:41,622 --> 00:41:43,647
I really wish I could,
but I can't right now.

438
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:45,420
How was your trip to New York?

439
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,450
You're such a bad boy.

440
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:53,996
The pickle association doesn't
limit itself to pickle workers.

441
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:56,299
No, sir. Pickles are seasonal.

442
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:59,363
So we're talking
about an association that...

443
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:03,343
represents the rights of pickle
and sauerkraut workers...

444
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:05,902
of the entire
west coast of America.

445
00:42:06,414 --> 00:42:08,882
What do you say we start
on the right track?

446
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,406
Nathan has come up with...

447
00:42:10,451 --> 00:42:13,614
an awareness campaign
that I think is interesting.

448
00:42:13,654 --> 00:42:16,748
That weather guy that wears
a different costume every show?

449
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,691
Send him a pickle suit.

450
00:42:18,726 --> 00:42:21,786
Then we send him
a sauerkraut and hot dog suit.

451
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:24,263
Two suits. Two shows.

452
00:42:24,765 --> 00:42:27,928
We could try
a hot dog association campaign.

453
00:42:27,968 --> 00:42:29,731
Wed sauerkraut to the dog.

454
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,365
We find the foremost
hot dog maker in the country.

455
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:36,399
- Gus. Gus bank.
- We get him to talk about...

456
00:42:36,444 --> 00:42:38,412
how good and
how traditional it is...

457
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:40,937
to have sauerkraut
with the hot dog.

458
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:42,915
We piggy-back on the dog.

459
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,315
"Everyone loves a dog."

460
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,911
This is a very bad time
for sauerkraut.

461
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:50,412
I'm the first to admit
it's not designer food.

462
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:54,394
We want to target the under 21s,
the rock-and-roll...

463
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:57,420
max will direct the spots.

464
00:42:57,465 --> 00:43:00,434
You saw his show reel
and you liked it very much.

465
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:04,905
Max, you want to toss a few logs
on the campfire here?

466
00:43:07,074 --> 00:43:08,905
The national pickle awards.

467
00:43:10,244 --> 00:43:12,269
And who would get these awards?

468
00:43:12,313 --> 00:43:14,577
Anyone famous who's in a fix.

469
00:43:17,418 --> 00:43:18,908
The British royal family.

470
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:23,415
John Wayne bobbitt.

471
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:29,896
I think you'd probably
like to elucidate on that...

472
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,420
a little bit there, max.

473
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,898
"He was caught between..."

474
00:43:34,935 --> 00:43:37,529
"his bun and his sauerkraut."

475
00:43:41,776 --> 00:43:44,108
"It was no big dill."

476
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:49,814
Speaking frankly...

477
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,216
I'll never put that shit on my reel.

478
00:43:52,253 --> 00:43:53,982
It's not always about art.

479
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:57,013
Wait a minute.
Just think about the company.

480
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:58,422
What about the profile?

481
00:43:58,459 --> 00:44:01,485
Did we put this hip show
together so I could put...

482
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:03,520
the green peen on screen?

483
00:44:03,564 --> 00:44:06,863
If it's just about numbers,
fine, go ahead.

484
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:08,391
You do that. I'm out of here.

485
00:44:10,538 --> 00:44:13,871
What you should do
is try to keep accounts...

486
00:44:13,908 --> 00:44:15,535
like the Armani account.

487
00:44:15,576 --> 00:44:17,407
Now, see, that's impressive.

488
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:23,405
Fucking pickles.

489
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:27,912
These are the 2 ladies
from Armani.

490
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:31,118
- Max Carlylse.
- I hear you're a genius.

491
00:44:31,158 --> 00:44:32,921
- Thank you very much.
- That's a good one.

492
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,518
There were supposed to be 50.

493
00:44:34,562 --> 00:44:38,089
There were. I couldn't get
25 of them to shave their heads.

494
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:41,397
George, hang on a second.
Give me one second.

495
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:43,403
- Excuse me.
- Go pick some more leaves.

496
00:44:43,437 --> 00:44:44,904
These Armani ladies...

497
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:47,100
are born again hard
about the nipple thing.

498
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,540
- My nipples.
- You have wonderful nipples.

499
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:50,203
These are my nipples.

500
00:44:50,244 --> 00:44:52,405
- You look marvelous, okay?
- You look absolutely beautiful.

501
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:53,777
I'll talk to you soon.

502
00:44:53,814 --> 00:44:56,408
I won't talk to
other people, okay?

503
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,350
- You can't leave.
- I won't leave.

504
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:02,845
Stay in your light.
Such a professional.

505
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:03,857
Don't patronize me.

506
00:45:03,891 --> 00:45:05,518
I'm a vegetarian.

507
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:09,154
I've said it 5 times today.
Fish-eating vegetarian.

508
00:45:09,196 --> 00:45:10,857
The dress doesn't
make the woman.

509
00:45:10,898 --> 00:45:12,923
The woman makes the dress.

510
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:14,696
What's wrong?
Are you on your period?

511
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:15,759
I'll come back tomorrow.

512
00:45:15,803 --> 00:45:18,363
I'll do it tomorrow.
I'll go home.

513
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:19,872
You can't come back.

514
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:22,876
What they're really
concerned about is...

515
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,377
how many of their
$4,000 dresses...

516
00:45:24,411 --> 00:45:26,902
will we drag through
potter's field?

517
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:38,752
The next year was a tough one.

518
00:45:40,628 --> 00:45:44,189
Everything in my life seemed
to change at the same time.

519
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:47,223
There was nothing
I could do except watch.

520
00:45:50,437 --> 00:45:52,428
It was as if I didn't exist.

521
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,932
I could see myself,
and I could hear myself.

522
00:45:58,279 --> 00:46:01,874
But I was detached
from the whole process.

523
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:06,114
I love my wife.

524
00:46:06,153 --> 00:46:08,451
I adore my kids,

525
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:11,856
but I wasn't me anymore.

526
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:14,554
Just wasn't me.

527
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:18,224
What did I miss?
What did I miss?

528
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:22,533
I said that frankly I don't
understand the gay thing.

529
00:46:22,569 --> 00:46:26,869
I know we're supposed to be
liberal here in California...

530
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:28,534
and all, but...

531
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:30,736
you know,
men are not natural...

532
00:46:30,778 --> 00:46:32,370
grinding away on each other.

533
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:34,040
But women...

534
00:46:34,081 --> 00:46:35,412
- are natural.
- Are natural.

535
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:41,886
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yes.

536
00:46:41,922 --> 00:46:43,913
Have you ever kissed
a man before?

537
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,688
I have not kissed a man
in my entire life.

538
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:50,924
Look at that smile.

539
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,061
Denial. Denial.

540
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:56,433
But you do like anal sex though?

541
00:46:59,006 --> 00:47:02,840
Given that we both work
in the advertising industry,

542
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:04,468
I've seen you kiss asses...

543
00:47:04,511 --> 00:47:05,500
and you've...

544
00:47:07,014 --> 00:47:09,346
we've seen me kiss asses.

545
00:47:09,383 --> 00:47:10,850
So that's a yes?

546
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:13,876
I guess we have equanimity
in that area.

547
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:19,890
The steaming question is,
have you ever kissed a man?

548
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:28,167
Get out of here.

549
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:31,663
Now, does that make me
any less of a man now?

550
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:33,400
Not in my opinion.

551
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:38,401
I guess that's a question
that we should pose to Mimi.

552
00:47:39,747 --> 00:47:42,910
Where is that coffee?

553
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,785
Pretty goddamn spectacular...

554
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:53,225
to be on safari last year
with Marie in the Congo.

555
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,091
In the middle of the jungle,

556
00:47:55,129 --> 00:47:59,293
we could return to our
hotel room, flip on the tele,

557
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,324
get CNN, find out
what was happening...

558
00:48:01,368 --> 00:48:02,960
in the first and second worlds.

559
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:07,930
Before I book our vacations
in places like that,

560
00:48:07,975 --> 00:48:10,808
I always ask if they,
you know, have CNN.

561
00:48:10,844 --> 00:48:13,335
Most of the places have CNN now.

562
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,110
Actually, not only
do they have CNN,

563
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,378
they have MTV.

564
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:20,375
I know.

565
00:48:22,222 --> 00:48:23,553
Certain shows are educational.

566
00:48:24,892 --> 00:48:27,360
Television is
the worst fucking thing...

567
00:48:27,394 --> 00:48:30,557
that has ever happened
to America.

568
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:35,861
You sit there and watch
all these little talk shows.

569
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:37,871
Talk show after talk show.

570
00:48:37,905 --> 00:48:39,065
You sit there
and you're entertained...

571
00:48:39,106 --> 00:48:41,870
by fucked-up
dysfunctional people.

572
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:43,570
Then they come along with...

573
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:47,376
nice little TV news
with 30-second sound bites,

574
00:48:47,414 --> 00:48:50,212
throw in a few
human interest stories.

575
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,376
Nice and cute.

576
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:54,387
So that all of us
won't take a fucking.45...

577
00:48:54,421 --> 00:48:56,286
and blow our
fucking brains out.

578
00:48:56,323 --> 00:48:59,349
- Don't be so dramatic.
- Isn't that good?

579
00:48:59,393 --> 00:49:02,328
You want to know
what television really is?

580
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:04,330
It's your paycheck.

581
00:49:04,364 --> 00:49:08,494
Television
is a frontal lobotomy.

582
00:49:12,206 --> 00:49:15,835
Let's hear it for
Joseph Lenin's right-hand man.

583
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:20,939
Spouting his poet warrior
philosophies about television.

584
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:22,539
No, thank you.

585
00:49:24,051 --> 00:49:26,884
Dope-smoking man-kissing max.

586
00:49:28,088 --> 00:49:30,886
Hey, tambourine man,
the '60s are over.

587
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:34,224
You know what?

588
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:39,388
Fuck you.

589
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:48,203
On that signal...

590
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,878
anybody care for dessert?

591
00:49:51,912 --> 00:49:55,075
We've got bailey's, haagen-dazs.
Your favorite, don.

592
00:49:56,917 --> 00:49:58,248
We have to go in a moment.

593
00:50:05,926 --> 00:50:07,416
That finished the party off.

594
00:50:08,929 --> 00:50:12,421
I thought we'd lighten
things up a bit, you know.

595
00:50:13,433 --> 00:50:15,424
Have a real conversation
for a change.

596
00:50:20,941 --> 00:50:22,272
I don't think so.

597
00:50:23,944 --> 00:50:27,402
Everybody had a great time
until you made it serious.

598
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:29,915
You have to show
what a deep thinker you are...

599
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,577
and how stupid we are.

600
00:50:31,618 --> 00:50:34,917
Some people are
interested in things...

601
00:50:34,955 --> 00:50:35,922
other than fucking bottled water.

602
00:50:35,956 --> 00:50:37,924
Like your assistant for example

603
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,425
Mickey? What? Come on.

604
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:41,950
She hangs onto your every word.

605
00:50:43,964 --> 00:50:45,454
What are you talking about?

606
00:50:48,135 --> 00:50:49,466
Are you fucking her?

607
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,630
What?

608
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:55,131
Somebody has to be getting it,
and it sure ain't me.

609
00:50:58,478 --> 00:50:59,968
She'd like you to fuck her.

610
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:02,541
Really.

611
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,414
Really. Or what about Marie?

612
00:51:04,918 --> 00:51:07,409
She found you
fascinating suddenly.

613
00:51:07,454 --> 00:51:09,979
Well, yeah. I am fascinating.

614
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:14,551
Speaking of Marie, maybe Marie
does find me fascinating...

615
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:17,792
because her husband looked down
your dress all night.

616
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:20,891
- Now it's the dress.
- I like the dress. Great.

617
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:23,903
No, it's how you wear the dress.

618
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:28,169
I think you may be
in the minority, because...

619
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:29,573
to be honest, it's nice to know...

620
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:32,408
that some men
find me attractive.

621
00:51:32,446 --> 00:51:33,913
You are attractive!

622
00:51:33,947 --> 00:51:35,915
You don't have to expose
your breasts...

623
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:38,417
to be constantly
fucking endorsed, is all.

624
00:51:38,452 --> 00:51:40,920
I was not...

625
00:51:40,954 --> 00:51:43,422
- did it even dawn on you...
- fuck you.

626
00:51:43,457 --> 00:51:44,924
When you leaned over the table...

627
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:45,925
fuck you.

628
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:48,894
That you are exposing
your fucking breasts?

629
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:49,918
You know?

630
00:51:49,963 --> 00:51:51,658
This something that
you work all out?

631
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:53,563
Is that it?

632
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:57,429
- You are so f...
- maybe you worked this all out.

633
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:59,939
You are just so stoned
out of your mind...

634
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:02,373
because you don't make sense.

635
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:04,104
- I'll try.
- I don't know...

636
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:05,202
what you're trying to say.

637
00:52:05,245 --> 00:52:06,507
Listen, listen...

638
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:11,813
is it possible that when
you buy those low-cut dresses...

639
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:16,221
that you go there
and you decide on...

640
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:19,885
if a lean to the left or shade
too much of the left side?

641
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:21,393
No, you don't buy
dresses that way.

642
00:52:21,428 --> 00:52:25,728
If you lean to the right
it shows the little pink area

643
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,781
may I help you, sir?

644
00:53:52,953 --> 00:53:56,081
Yes. I'm looking
for Charlie rivers.

645
00:53:56,123 --> 00:53:57,613
He's right over there.

646
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:01,059
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

647
00:54:17,077 --> 00:54:18,066
Hey, man.

648
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:20,068
How you doing?

649
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:40,922
Good morning, Charlie.

650
00:54:42,436 --> 00:54:43,994
Hi, gentlemen.

651
00:54:45,472 --> 00:54:46,564
How did you sleep?

652
00:54:56,516 --> 00:54:57,505
Here.

653
00:55:10,397 --> 00:55:11,830
I'll give Charlie his bath.

654
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:13,890
You may prefer to wait outside.

655
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:23,740
Stick around.

656
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:31,406
We slept good last night.

657
00:55:40,093 --> 00:55:41,924
It's Vernon. Charlie's brother.

658
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:44,085
Vernon.

659
00:55:45,332 --> 00:55:47,892
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

660
00:55:47,934 --> 00:55:50,425
Shit. Sorry.
Let's get rid of these.

661
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:53,828
Oh, boy.

662
00:55:58,778 --> 00:56:00,439
How are things going here?

663
00:56:01,515 --> 00:56:05,042
The doctor gives him a week.
Maybe two.

664
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,086
I hear things are
going great for you.

665
00:56:16,129 --> 00:56:18,154
Charlie said business is good.

666
00:56:18,198 --> 00:56:20,359
- Things are fine.
- That's good.

667
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,664
That's nice to hear.
That's really good.

668
00:56:22,702 --> 00:56:26,138
Being in I.A. Enjoying it.
What a dream that must be.

669
00:56:26,172 --> 00:56:29,039
- I'm doing well.
- Good.

670
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:31,703
That's great. You meet
any stars? Do you ever?

671
00:56:31,745 --> 00:56:34,339
Probably not.
That's all right.

672
00:56:34,381 --> 00:56:36,372
The last time I saw you...

673
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:37,610
you know...

674
00:56:37,651 --> 00:56:39,016
is there a bathroom
around here?

675
00:56:40,921 --> 00:56:43,890
There's... well,
you don't use that one.

676
00:56:43,924 --> 00:56:45,391
I think it's down on the left.

677
00:56:45,425 --> 00:56:47,416
Great. Great. Excuse me.

678
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:06,038
Max, how you doing, buddy?

679
00:57:07,714 --> 00:57:09,545
I'm fine. How are you?

680
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:17,388
I'm really tired. I can't sleep.

681
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:24,488
How long can you stay?

682
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:33,895
I know Vern' gave you
the skinny. Okay?

683
00:57:35,075 --> 00:57:37,441
I know it, so...

684
00:57:38,912 --> 00:57:41,540
best thing for you to do is...

685
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:43,048
I'll be straight with you.

686
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:44,607
- You be straight with me.
- All right.

687
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:45,913
You know what's going on.

688
00:57:48,655 --> 00:57:51,385
I'm here to be useful.

689
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:54,393
Anything you want,
you just ask, and I'll do it.

690
00:57:54,861 --> 00:57:57,386
The first thing you can do
is move this pillow.

691
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,762
Turn it around.
This side is wet.

692
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:03,002
And pull me over
a little to the left.

693
00:58:04,604 --> 00:58:05,764
Here you go.

694
00:58:05,805 --> 00:58:08,273
Sweating my skull off.

695
00:58:09,376 --> 00:58:11,173
All right. How's that?

696
00:58:11,211 --> 00:58:13,076
Man, such a difference.

697
00:58:13,113 --> 00:58:15,707
Really? You are sweating.

698
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:24,356
Get me some really good bud.

699
00:58:24,391 --> 00:58:25,858
I should have known.

700
00:58:25,892 --> 00:58:28,053
- It's done.
- Okay.

701
00:58:30,063 --> 00:58:31,860
Did you come alone?

702
00:58:32,832 --> 00:58:33,821
Sure.

703
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:36,869
Mimi's coming later on.

704
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:38,393
Mimi's coming?

705
00:58:41,107 --> 00:58:43,769
Must be a lot sicker
than I thought.

706
00:58:51,918 --> 00:58:53,715
The traffic sucks.

707
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:57,712
So by the time
that I want to see the people,

708
00:58:57,757 --> 00:59:01,591
the people I love,
they don't get me at my best.

709
00:59:03,697 --> 00:59:07,133
Sloppy. You know?
I need you to manage it.

710
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,829
You can do it without being
impolite and all that.

711
00:59:09,869 --> 00:59:10,858
All right.

712
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:12,633
What's the best time
I should visit?

713
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:15,799
The graveyard.

714
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,744
Right before dawn.
That's when it's really scary.

715
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,382
About 5:30, 5:45.

716
00:59:25,051 --> 00:59:27,884
I shit in my pants
for fear of death.

717
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:31,685
Be here then, would be nice.

718
00:59:36,229 --> 00:59:37,560
I'll be here.

719
00:59:43,303 --> 00:59:46,170
I realized that
he was going to die.

720
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:47,867
'Course, I had known
that all along,

721
00:59:47,907 --> 00:59:50,239
but up until that moment,

722
00:59:50,276 --> 00:59:53,370
it was an abstract idea.

723
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:55,381
Now it was reality.

724
00:59:55,415 --> 00:59:57,883
What I meant was that
Charlie'd be leaving soon...

725
00:59:57,917 --> 00:59:59,817
and he wouldn't come back.

726
01:00:00,653 --> 01:00:03,383
Death is so fucking strange.

727
01:00:03,423 --> 01:00:07,189
Everything in me
that was hollow and false...

728
01:00:07,227 --> 01:00:10,025
seemed so clear, suddenly.

729
01:00:21,608 --> 01:00:23,701
Look at you.

730
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:26,576
- You're beautiful.
- Start the party.

731
01:00:26,613 --> 01:00:28,080
I've arrived.

732
01:00:31,684 --> 01:00:33,413
It's on the fifth.
Not the third.

733
01:00:33,453 --> 01:00:35,284
The day after tomorrow.

734
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:37,789
No. It's on the third.

735
01:00:37,824 --> 01:00:40,122
All right, it's the third.

736
01:00:57,544 --> 01:01:01,173
- Max. How you doing?
- Vern. Good to see you.

737
01:01:01,214 --> 01:01:03,182
I'd like you to meet my wife.

738
01:01:08,221 --> 01:01:09,210
There you go.

739
01:01:15,595 --> 01:01:16,994
Hi. How are you?

740
01:01:42,622 --> 01:01:44,249
When's your wife coming in?

741
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,786
Is your wife coming?
Is she?

742
01:01:48,962 --> 01:01:50,259
- When's she get...
- tomorrow.

743
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:52,890
We should get together
and have dinner.

744
01:01:52,932 --> 01:01:55,799
There's a great place downtown.
You like sushi?

745
01:01:58,137 --> 01:01:59,627
That's good.
Let's do it.

746
01:02:27,267 --> 01:02:30,896
I'm scared because that
list of all the people.

747
01:02:30,937 --> 01:02:33,770
I slept good and I got to call
all those people.

748
01:02:38,945 --> 01:02:40,913
I'm angry because there's
sores in my mouth...

749
01:02:40,947 --> 01:02:43,142
and Kevin won't kiss me anymore.

750
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:45,778
I'll listen to your heart.

751
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:55,052
- It sounds good.
- Still there?

752
01:02:55,094 --> 01:02:55,753
Still there.

753
01:02:55,795 --> 01:02:57,262
Good.

754
01:02:57,297 --> 01:02:58,787
Let's try the lungs.

755
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:05,863
I need you to breathe
for me a bit.

756
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:07,065
Deep one.

757
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:10,740
One more.

758
01:03:12,912 --> 01:03:14,379
One more.

759
01:03:14,414 --> 01:03:17,872
I think I'll go ahead
and go now.

760
01:03:17,917 --> 01:03:19,714
I would.

761
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,276
You want anything
from the store?

762
01:03:21,321 --> 01:03:23,414
One more breath, Charlie.

763
01:03:28,094 --> 01:03:29,721
Some good food?

764
01:03:29,762 --> 01:03:32,560
Some good food or
I don't know, or Carnegie deli.

765
01:03:32,598 --> 01:03:33,758
Good, good.

766
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,903
How about that papaya juice?

767
01:03:37,937 --> 01:03:40,906
Papaya juice.
The enzyme thing.

768
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,773
- That's good for the...
- that's good for your mouth.

769
01:03:46,612 --> 01:03:48,546
Can we put the blue shirt on?

770
01:03:53,953 --> 01:03:57,548
You're kicking ass,
doing a great job for me.

771
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:02,018
But I'm worried
about you because...

772
01:04:02,061 --> 01:04:05,121
- you're worried about me?
- You don't look happy.

773
01:04:05,164 --> 01:04:07,962
You deserve to be happy.
You spend all your time here.

774
01:04:09,402 --> 01:04:12,599
I want to check his back.
Real slow.

775
01:04:12,638 --> 01:04:14,697
Chris said that you're
anxious and depressed...

776
01:04:14,741 --> 01:04:16,174
and I said, yep.

777
01:04:16,209 --> 01:04:19,372
- Isn't that what you said?
- Anxious and depressed.

778
01:04:19,412 --> 01:04:21,039
You worry about you.
I'll worry...

779
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,379
okay, listen.
All right? Look at me.

780
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:26,009
Life is short.

781
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,216
The tree huggers are right.
This is not a rehearsal.

782
01:04:30,256 --> 01:04:31,746
This is it.

783
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:36,251
Okay, man. Good-bye.
I'll see you.

784
01:04:38,765 --> 01:04:40,062
How's the breathing level?

785
01:04:40,099 --> 01:04:43,728
It's good. He'll get me
some grass. Is that okay?

786
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,237
It is not okay.

787
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:46,898
Why? I have
no immunities, anyway.

788
01:04:46,939 --> 01:04:48,236
What'll that do?

789
01:04:48,274 --> 01:04:50,435
It'll be harder
for you to breathe.

790
01:06:07,386 --> 01:06:09,047
Remember me?

791
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:13,549
It's good to see you.

792
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:16,921
Happy birthday.

793
01:06:16,963 --> 01:06:18,362
I didn't know
it was your birthday.

794
01:06:18,397 --> 01:06:19,921
Max didn't tell me.

795
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:23,333
We have 2 beautiful kids.

796
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:24,859
We couldn't bring them.

797
01:06:24,904 --> 01:06:26,838
I mean, is this okay?

798
01:06:26,873 --> 01:06:28,431
It's really good to see you.

799
01:06:33,913 --> 01:06:35,505
How you doing?

800
01:06:35,548 --> 01:06:39,040
I'll just do something for you.

801
01:06:39,085 --> 01:06:40,609
It's your birthday, right?

802
01:06:40,653 --> 01:06:43,383
Who's that talking with Charlie?

803
01:06:43,422 --> 01:06:46,448
- That's Vernon. His brother.
- That's Vernon.

804
01:06:46,492 --> 01:06:50,223
We must go. I won't be able
to come for a few days.

805
01:06:50,263 --> 01:06:51,491
Max'll be here.

806
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:54,432
I'll be back when I can.
Take care.

807
01:06:59,572 --> 01:07:02,666
Hi, Vernon.
This is my wife, Mimi.

808
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:05,176
Hello, Vernon.
It's a pleasure. Hello.

809
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:08,146
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.

810
01:07:08,181 --> 01:07:10,172
- This is...
- I'm Karen.

811
01:07:10,216 --> 01:07:12,582
Nice to meet you, Karen.

812
01:07:12,618 --> 01:07:15,018
- And, you are...?
- My wife.

813
01:07:15,054 --> 01:07:16,954
Okay. That's what I figured.

814
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:19,014
It's great you could be here.

815
01:07:19,058 --> 01:07:20,719
Sure. Sure.

816
01:07:23,896 --> 01:07:25,193
Way to go, doc.

817
01:07:25,932 --> 01:07:27,923
So, anybody hungry?

818
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:30,959
- Listen, no, no.
- Yes, actually. We...

819
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:32,971
that place we talked about...

820
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:34,404
remember that sushi...

821
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,032
- I love sushi.
- It's fantastic.

822
01:07:36,075 --> 01:07:37,565
I'm not hungry.

823
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:42,548
Maybe it was a woman's instinct
or a maternal instinct.

824
01:07:42,582 --> 01:07:44,709
Protecting our kids.
Remember, honey?

825
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:47,378
I said, "I must sell this house."

826
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:50,548
I told you, right?
I had this 6th sense.

827
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:53,354
We sold it right
before the earthquake.

828
01:07:53,392 --> 01:07:55,087
- You had an intuition.
- Exactly.

829
01:07:55,127 --> 01:07:57,493
- I was insistent.
- That's what real estate is.

830
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,658
We sold the house.
At a really good price.

831
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,327
And then the earthquake hit.

832
01:08:02,368 --> 01:08:03,995
The big northridge earthquake.

833
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:05,731
It totaled the house.

834
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:07,739
I felt bad for the buyers.

835
01:08:07,773 --> 01:08:09,400
During the earthquake?

836
01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:12,002
After we sold it.

837
01:08:12,044 --> 01:08:15,070
That's beautiful.
Don't you love Japanese food?

838
01:08:15,114 --> 01:08:17,014
They're so pretty. Anyway...

839
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:20,246
real estate prices plummeted,

840
01:08:20,286 --> 01:08:22,584
and we got our new home,
this beautiful house for...

841
01:08:22,622 --> 01:08:24,351
half the price?

842
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:26,547
It's gorgeous.

843
01:08:26,592 --> 01:08:29,857
Smart. Housing prices out there
are at their lowest...

844
01:08:29,895 --> 01:08:31,522
since before the gold rush.

845
01:08:31,564 --> 01:08:34,124
With the mud slides,
everybody was afraid to move.

846
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:37,397
You know the mud slides
were started intentionally?

847
01:08:41,474 --> 01:08:42,463
What?

848
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:46,537
You can't have
fire hoses up there.

849
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:48,069
Right, honey.

850
01:08:52,018 --> 01:08:54,384
Such a goof ball. So...

851
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:58,083
we were tempted.
Tempted to move out there.

852
01:08:58,124 --> 01:09:01,890
I was. It was more difficult
for Karen because of her work.

853
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:06,191
So... what do you do, Karen?

854
01:09:08,868 --> 01:09:10,733
I'm a rocket scientist.

855
01:09:19,045 --> 01:09:20,808
She works for the Fairchild group.

856
01:09:22,548 --> 01:09:26,006
It's a company that design rockets...

857
01:09:26,052 --> 01:09:29,146
for satellite communications systems.

858
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:30,678
And telephone systems.

859
01:09:32,024 --> 01:09:33,013
Really?

860
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:37,518
But they closed their west coast
division last year...

861
01:09:37,563 --> 01:09:39,690
so we're still here.

862
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,131
You still live in New York?
What part?

863
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:45,364
- Upstate.
- Upstate.

864
01:09:46,572 --> 01:09:48,870
We've got a home
outside of Albany.

865
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:52,867
Oh, Albany.
I've heard of Albany.

866
01:09:52,912 --> 01:09:55,073
Don't we have
a friend in Albany?

867
01:09:59,085 --> 01:10:01,986
We must get back tomorrow,
so I thought...

868
01:10:02,021 --> 01:10:03,545
max, if it's okay with you,

869
01:10:03,589 --> 01:10:05,250
I'll leave you
a couple of numbers.

870
01:10:06,592 --> 01:10:08,719
The cellphone's on here.

871
01:10:08,761 --> 01:10:11,059
I'll give you the home in case...

872
01:10:11,097 --> 01:10:12,564
anything happens with Charlie.

873
01:10:12,598 --> 01:10:15,396
This must be really difficult for you.

874
01:10:15,434 --> 01:10:16,401
What?

875
01:10:16,435 --> 01:10:19,700
Watch my brother die, without
being able to do anything?

876
01:10:21,273 --> 01:10:22,706
It's so sad.

877
01:10:22,742 --> 01:10:24,903
Yep. It is.

878
01:10:24,944 --> 01:10:26,673
It sure is. But...

879
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,542
something to be expected.

880
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:35,153
You know, with the lifestyle
these guys lead, it's...

881
01:10:35,187 --> 01:10:39,146
if you see someone
playing in a mine field,

882
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:40,886
you expect to hear
an explosion, right?

883
01:10:41,761 --> 01:10:44,059
It didn't have to happen.

884
01:10:44,096 --> 01:10:46,428
And it didn't
have to happen to him.

885
01:10:46,465 --> 01:10:47,454
So stupid.

886
01:10:49,902 --> 01:10:50,834
I'm glad you're here.

887
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,997
I know it means
a lot to Charlie.

888
01:10:53,873 --> 01:10:56,307
It means a lot
to me, too, Vern.

889
01:11:02,615 --> 01:11:04,378
So, what do you say?

890
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:06,578
How about a toast to Charlie?

891
01:11:09,755 --> 01:11:11,620
- To Charlie.
- Yes. To Charlie.

892
01:11:11,657 --> 01:11:12,749
To Charlie.

893
01:11:21,267 --> 01:11:22,427
I'm fine.

894
01:11:24,437 --> 01:11:26,598
We should start digging into this...

895
01:11:26,639 --> 01:11:29,107
before it gets, what? Warm?

896
01:11:31,076 --> 01:11:33,067
You get it?

897
01:11:33,112 --> 01:11:35,774
Anyway, what do you want?
Do you want tuna?

898
01:11:37,116 --> 01:11:38,515
Cheer me up. Surprise me.

899
01:11:41,954 --> 01:11:44,286
Here we go. Taxi!

900
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:47,452
- We're sorry.
- That's good timing.

901
01:11:48,794 --> 01:11:51,695
- Perfect.
- This is for you.

902
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:53,163
You take it. Go ahead.

903
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:54,291
It's all right.

904
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:56,426
- You go ahead.
- No, it's all right.

905
01:11:56,469 --> 01:11:58,733
There's another one.
We'll catch that.

906
01:11:58,771 --> 01:12:01,239
- Please.
- Thanks. It was a good time.

907
01:12:01,273 --> 01:12:04,140
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

908
01:12:04,176 --> 01:12:05,939
It was a real pleasure.

909
01:12:05,978 --> 01:12:07,912
- We have to do it again.
- I hope so.

910
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:12,779
Good night.

911
01:12:12,818 --> 01:12:14,251
Let me get this.

912
01:12:17,256 --> 01:12:19,588
- Night.
- Good night.

913
01:12:37,443 --> 01:12:39,434
God, I wish I had a cigarette.

914
01:13:09,241 --> 01:13:10,401
Give him a shot.

915
01:13:20,419 --> 01:13:22,910
It's okay. It's okay.

916
01:14:31,256 --> 01:14:35,556
Why don't you speak sentences
instead of generalizations?

917
01:14:35,594 --> 01:14:37,755
- You know what?
- No, you know what?

918
01:14:38,597 --> 01:14:40,758
See, that's where, that's where...

919
01:15:10,729 --> 01:15:12,526
- morning.
- Hey, max.

920
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:16,368
It's not much, but I brought you
a little something.

921
01:15:16,402 --> 01:15:19,371
My appreciation for all
you're doing for Charlie.

922
01:15:19,405 --> 01:15:20,565
Thank you.

923
01:15:21,907 --> 01:15:24,137
Just, I mean, really, thank you.

924
01:15:25,077 --> 01:15:28,706
- He's hanging in.
- Great. I'll move on.

925
01:15:28,747 --> 01:15:31,580
See you a bit later.
Thanks, mate.

926
01:16:34,413 --> 01:16:35,539
When'd you get back?

927
01:16:36,582 --> 01:16:38,072
Last night.

928
01:16:50,062 --> 01:16:51,757
I liked your wife.

929
01:16:56,435 --> 01:16:57,925
She liked you, too.

930
01:16:59,772 --> 01:17:01,205
Oh, really.

931
01:17:09,548 --> 01:17:11,038
So, how is he doing?

932
01:17:14,052 --> 01:17:15,542
Not so good.

933
01:17:19,391 --> 01:17:21,382
But he talked a lot.

934
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:25,894
He told me you came
to visit him last year.

935
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:28,890
I realized it was that same time.

936
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:37,303
Same time.

937
01:17:39,912 --> 01:17:41,880
Is this really difficult for you?

938
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:44,579
No, it's okay.

939
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:48,910
As far as I'm concerned...

940
01:17:50,989 --> 01:17:52,422
nothing happened.

941
01:17:56,762 --> 01:17:57,751
Exactly.

942
01:17:59,431 --> 01:18:00,864
Nothing happened.

943
01:19:04,863 --> 01:19:06,194
Morning, Charlie.

944
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:13,193
New shift is here.

945
01:19:17,876 --> 01:19:19,366
How you feeling?

946
01:19:20,879 --> 01:19:22,176
Did you get some sleep?

947
01:19:25,384 --> 01:19:28,444
Kevin is coming at five. Okay?

948
01:19:28,487 --> 01:19:30,546
And I'll be here this afternoon.

949
01:20:05,257 --> 01:20:06,747
Hey, man.

950
01:20:08,427 --> 01:20:11,419
Sorry to wake you up
at dawn, right?

951
01:20:26,111 --> 01:20:28,409
Why are you kissing my...

952
01:20:28,447 --> 01:20:30,108
sister-in-law?

953
01:20:42,627 --> 01:20:45,755
Remember when I came
to New York?

954
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:47,128
To visit you?

955
01:20:51,136 --> 01:20:52,626
I missed my flight.

956
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,878
So, what should I do?

957
01:21:03,915 --> 01:21:05,746
Life is an orange, max.

958
01:21:07,919 --> 01:21:09,386
What does that mean?

959
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:10,911
You don't remember that joke?

960
01:21:13,425 --> 01:21:17,418
The young Jewish boy sitting
at the foot of his wise father.

961
01:21:19,931 --> 01:21:23,697
And his father says,
"always remember, son..."

962
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:26,601
"life is an orange."

963
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:31,238
He ponders.

964
01:21:31,276 --> 01:21:34,439
He thinks on the meaning
of this phrase his whole life.

965
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:42,716
About 60 years later,
his father's dying,

966
01:21:42,754 --> 01:21:45,450
and he goes to see him
for the last time...

967
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,954
and his father's slipping away...

968
01:21:52,964 --> 01:21:55,057
and he says,
"what did that mean, pa?"

969
01:21:55,967 --> 01:21:57,935
"What did what mean, son?"

970
01:21:57,969 --> 01:22:01,905
And then he says, "you know
that, that life is an orange."

971
01:22:04,743 --> 01:22:08,042
And with his dying breath,
his father says,

972
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,071
"I haven't a fucking clue."

973
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:15,742
Right.

974
01:22:18,657 --> 01:22:21,421
You must work out
your shit, max.

975
01:22:28,934 --> 01:22:30,731
That bad stuff
between you and me,

976
01:22:30,769 --> 01:22:32,964
that was a stupid waste of time.

977
01:22:35,273 --> 01:22:38,071
- No, that was...
- I know. I know.

978
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:41,045
It was me. I was envious.

979
01:22:41,446 --> 01:22:44,904
Envy is a god awful thing.

980
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:47,646
I was just very...

981
01:22:47,686 --> 01:22:50,416
I was pissed 'cause you left...

982
01:22:50,455 --> 01:22:51,945
and didn't take me with you.

983
01:22:54,459 --> 01:22:56,586
But I couldn't.
I didn't know how.

984
01:22:57,963 --> 01:22:59,760
I know.

985
01:22:59,798 --> 01:23:02,392
I just want things
to be clean between us.

986
01:23:10,575 --> 01:23:11,564
I'm sorry.

987
01:23:15,147 --> 01:23:16,739
It's okay, baby.

988
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:19,914
It's okay.

989
01:23:25,557 --> 01:23:29,254
This is a lot harder for
my friends than it is for me.

990
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:37,762
There's something
I must ask you.

991
01:23:40,939 --> 01:23:42,531
Do you want a priest?

992
01:23:44,442 --> 01:23:47,411
You listen to me, okay?
You listen to me right now.

993
01:23:47,445 --> 01:23:49,413
I seen too many people lose...

994
01:23:49,447 --> 01:23:51,574
their courage at the last minute.

995
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:54,111
I'm not sorry.

996
01:23:56,454 --> 01:23:57,580
I'm frightened.

997
01:23:58,757 --> 01:24:00,122
Frightened.

998
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:06,190
But I'm also fascinated...

999
01:24:06,231 --> 01:24:08,222
about what's next. So...

1000
01:24:11,903 --> 01:24:14,235
thanks, but no, thanks.

1001
01:24:19,177 --> 01:24:20,235
All right.

1002
01:24:34,593 --> 01:24:36,254
Your dad was here.

1003
01:24:58,083 --> 01:25:00,677
I guess that I'll best...

1004
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,711
best remember him
as my kid brother.

1005
01:25:04,389 --> 01:25:06,357
On the beach.

1006
01:25:06,391 --> 01:25:10,088
Dreams of hitting the big time
on Broadway.

1007
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,027
I remember one time
I was coming home from school

1008
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:21,868
and I got home
and there he was...

1009
01:25:21,906 --> 01:25:24,704
coming out
of our mother's bedroom...

1010
01:25:24,743 --> 01:25:26,608
dressed in one of her outfits.

1011
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,207
And he had lipstick on that day.

1012
01:25:31,249 --> 01:25:34,241
He was definitely
ahead of his time.

1013
01:25:36,254 --> 01:25:40,054
It was his last wish that we
have a celebration of his life

1014
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:42,924
and that's what we'll do.

1015
01:25:45,263 --> 01:25:48,130
After the service,
we'll have a party.

1016
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:50,498
It's what he wanted.

1017
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:55,470
He paid for everything.
That's what we'll do.

1018
01:26:17,228 --> 01:26:18,217
I don't know.

1019
01:26:19,397 --> 01:26:22,366
Who needs a drink?
You want a drink?

1020
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,392
You know, actually, I think
I'll take a little walk.

1021
01:26:26,738 --> 01:26:28,399
I'll be in shortly.

1022
01:29:58,716 --> 01:30:00,707
We should all get pregnant and...

1023
01:30:00,752 --> 01:30:02,344
are you okay?

1024
01:30:04,022 --> 01:30:06,456
Have all these little Charles.

1025
01:30:07,025 --> 01:30:08,822
What's wrong with Karen?

1026
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:11,158
She's had too much to drink.

1027
01:30:11,195 --> 01:30:13,425
She fell dancing.

1028
01:30:16,434 --> 01:30:17,901
Very strange.

1029
01:30:17,936 --> 01:30:20,598
Let's have little Charles tonight!

1030
01:30:31,616 --> 01:30:33,447
Do you want some of this?

1031
01:30:47,832 --> 01:30:49,459
Still don't look happy, max.

1032
01:30:50,802 --> 01:30:51,962
Do something.

1033
01:31:35,113 --> 01:31:36,580
Hey, can I cut in?

1034
01:31:36,614 --> 01:31:38,411
You want to cut in?

1035
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:40,280
Dance with this.

1036
01:31:50,128 --> 01:31:52,824
- What are you doing?
- Hopefully dancing.

1037
01:31:52,864 --> 01:31:54,263
Are we dancing?

1038
01:31:54,298 --> 01:31:55,993
Will you dance with me?

1039
01:32:08,413 --> 01:32:10,404
Wait, you're supposed
to dance with me.

1040
01:32:42,613 --> 01:32:44,604
- Are you crazy?
- I'm not crazy.

1041
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:48,578
I think there's someone.

1042
01:33:48,613 --> 01:33:51,275
I think there's someone
in the house.

1043
01:34:37,428 --> 01:34:40,192
This internet thing...

1044
01:34:40,231 --> 01:34:42,597
it's all a new concept to me.

1045
01:34:42,633 --> 01:34:44,225
It was for me too.

1046
01:34:44,268 --> 01:34:46,896
But once you start,
you can't stop.

1047
01:34:46,938 --> 01:34:48,428
Anything you want to know.

1048
01:34:48,472 --> 01:34:50,064
- It baffles me.
- It's great.

1049
01:34:50,107 --> 01:34:53,543
And you get addicted to it
because you have so much.

1050
01:34:53,578 --> 01:34:56,411
I've been out of touch
but that's where it's at.

1051
01:34:56,447 --> 01:34:59,075
- Nice acreage?
- You can get some good stuff?

1052
01:34:59,116 --> 01:35:00,640
Can you grow marijuana?

1053
01:35:00,685 --> 01:35:03,279
You can grow
anything you want.

1054
01:35:03,321 --> 01:35:05,846
I wonder about people's minds.

1055
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:07,448
What they can come up with.

1056
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:09,959
Little old me, I can't conceive of it.

1057
01:35:09,994 --> 01:35:13,191
Kids use it
instead of the encyclopedia.

1058
01:35:13,231 --> 01:35:15,131
I went to see
Charlie last week.

1059
01:35:15,166 --> 01:35:17,293
Visit the grave.

1060
01:35:17,335 --> 01:35:19,462
Put some flowers down.

1061
01:35:19,503 --> 01:35:21,437
You wouldn't believe the house.

1062
01:35:21,472 --> 01:35:24,373
- What have they done to it?
- It's completely different.

1063
01:35:24,408 --> 01:35:26,035
They did the gardens all over.

1064
01:35:26,077 --> 01:35:27,908
Remember how they
were nice, overgrown?

1065
01:35:27,945 --> 01:35:30,004
Everything's different.

1066
01:35:30,047 --> 01:35:32,515
You don't even
recognize it anymore.

1067
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:34,415
You go back to a place
that was yours...

1068
01:35:34,452 --> 01:35:36,044
and now it's not.

1069
01:35:36,087 --> 01:35:38,385
The only thing I hear
about the internet thing...

1070
01:35:38,422 --> 01:35:40,413
is what, cyber-sex?

1071
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:42,949
- Porch is gone.
- The porch is gone?

1072
01:35:42,994 --> 01:35:45,758
They took the porch off.
That was a nice porch.

1073
01:35:45,796 --> 01:35:48,924
They rebuilt it.
Walled it in with glass.

1074
01:35:48,966 --> 01:35:51,161
Garden's changed.
The pool's gone.

1075
01:35:51,202 --> 01:35:54,467
Everything's all manicured.
Precise.

1076
01:35:59,944 --> 01:36:01,138
Stuffed.

1077
01:36:01,178 --> 01:36:02,702
It's good.

1078
01:36:05,049 --> 01:36:06,380
Check, please.

1079
01:36:10,688 --> 01:36:11,882
There you go.

1080
01:36:15,726 --> 01:36:18,957
- Let me get that.
- We'll split it. Here.

1081
01:36:20,564 --> 01:36:21,895
Thank you.

1082
01:36:24,068 --> 01:36:27,060
Want to go down to Soho
and get a drink?

1083
01:36:27,104 --> 01:36:31,370
Got to pick the kids up
in about an hour and a half.

1084
01:36:31,409 --> 01:36:34,606
- Where are they?
- At the movies.

1085
01:36:34,645 --> 01:36:36,112
What are they seeing?

1086
01:36:36,147 --> 01:36:38,809
Something completely unsuitable
for them.

1087
01:36:38,849 --> 01:36:40,783
But max insisted.

1088
01:36:41,919 --> 01:36:42,943
Come on.

1089
01:36:42,987 --> 01:36:45,547
We got to stop treating
them like children.

1090
01:36:45,589 --> 01:36:48,149
They grow up too fast, honey.

1091
01:36:48,192 --> 01:36:49,591
They hear everything in school.

1092
01:36:50,594 --> 01:36:51,925
It's weird.

1093
01:36:52,964 --> 01:36:54,955
What can you do?

1094
01:36:54,999 --> 01:37:00,062
I had... had this weird dream
the other night.

1095
01:37:00,104 --> 01:37:04,165
I was in this hotel and...

1096
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:07,405
by myself. I didn't know
where I was or anything but...

1097
01:37:07,445 --> 01:37:10,005
sitting there
and the phone rang.

1098
01:37:10,047 --> 01:37:13,016
So I picked it up
and it was Charlie.

1099
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:16,349
And he says,
"how you doing?"

1100
01:37:16,387 --> 01:37:17,854
"Okay."

1101
01:37:17,888 --> 01:37:19,856
"Don't worry.
Everything's all right."

1102
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:21,380
"Everything's cool."

1103
01:37:22,727 --> 01:37:24,524
Life's an orange.

1104
01:37:24,562 --> 01:37:26,894
- It is.
- Life is short.

1105
01:37:30,901 --> 01:37:33,734
No, it was cool.
No, it made me feel good.

1106
01:37:36,374 --> 01:37:38,171
You want to take this one?

1107
01:37:38,209 --> 01:37:39,699
- You go ahead.
- You go ahead.

1108
01:37:39,744 --> 01:37:43,703
It's all right.
You're in a hurry. Go ahead.

1109
01:37:43,748 --> 01:37:45,875
It's fine. Go ahead.

1110
01:37:45,916 --> 01:37:49,374
We'll go walk around
and enjoy the fresh air.

1111
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:51,581
If you can call this fresh air.

1112
01:37:53,924 --> 01:37:55,391
It's better than I.A.

1113
01:37:55,426 --> 01:37:57,986
Well, anything's better than I.A.

1114
01:38:02,566 --> 01:38:04,727
Take care. All right.

1115
01:38:19,383 --> 01:38:20,748
Excuse me.

1116
01:38:20,785 --> 01:38:23,913
You'll bring the kids
to the airport tomorrow?

1117
01:38:23,954 --> 01:38:25,854
All right. The flight's at one.

1118
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:26,857
I know.

1119
01:38:26,891 --> 01:38:29,052
It was good to see you, max.

1120
01:38:29,093 --> 01:38:30,993
Good to see you too.

1121
01:38:33,931 --> 01:38:37,196
Be make sure the kids
are properly packed.

1122
01:38:37,234 --> 01:38:39,998
Last time you left
half their stuff at your place.

1123
01:38:40,037 --> 01:38:41,595
I'll do it. Good-bye.

1124
01:38:42,305 --> 01:38:48,919
