00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,620
<i>Go well past it.
Right.</i>

3
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,688
Oh, I thought...

4
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,725
You need to go
one block this way...

5
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,238
This is LaSalle?
This is LaSalle Street.

6
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:17,709
All you have to do is go
two blocks this way, one block
that way, and you're there.

7
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,768
Thanks.
Sure.

8
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,743
<i>Holy shit.</i>

9
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,015
Tom, I just hit somebody.
Can you believe it?

10
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,080
Okay, Le Petit Auberge
at 8:00. Right.

11
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,450
Oh, damn!

12
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,518
Is he all right?
Somebody call an ambulance!

13
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,498
It wasn't my fault. He stepped
off the curb in front of me.
You saw it, didn't you?

14
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,434
I saw it.
Great. Great.

15
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,370
<i>Is he okay?
You saw him jump
in front of my car, right?</i>

16
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,033
Do you mind?
This man is hurt.
Someone call the police.

17
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,270
Please? Call the police.
No, no.

18
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,278
I'll call them.
No.

19
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,214
<i>I'm late for work.
I'm gonna get fired
my first day on thejob.</i>

20
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,274
I-I-I don't think
you should move.

21
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,980
You could have
internal bleeding
or soft tissue injury.

22
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,751
What?
Look, you're sitting up.
You're fine.

23
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:08,021
We should wait for the police.
They're gonna know
what to do with this.

24
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,221
Ow. Oh.
You might think about
calling your lawyer.

25
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,096
Hey, look. We do not
have to make a federal case
out of this thing, huh?

26
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,625
Why don't I give you,
say, uh, ooh, uh,

27
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,695
a hundred dollars
for your troubles?

28
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,572
What? Ow.
My cousin Al got nailed
one time like this.

29
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,907
I think he got paid
something like
a million-five.

30
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,313
Okay, okay, uh,
everything I got.
Uh, 266.

31
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,943
I'm late.
What time is it?

32
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,477
The guy can't afford
a watch, you give him
a lousy 266?

33
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,356
Here. Take mine.

34
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:44,055
Really? Thanks.
That's a nice ring.

35
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,391
Ow.
All right.
Come on.

36
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,868
Easy. Easy. Ow! Geez!
Okay. Take it easy.

37
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,497
Move out of the way!
Give the guy some room!

38
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,133
Ice is good for this.
Take care of the leg,
all right?

39
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,143
Okay. Yeah, he's...
Very good.

40
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,839
Ice and heat.
No, heat and ice! That's it.

41
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,077
Boy, you are
a lucky guy. Huh?
Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,847
Hey, um, little word of advice,
if you don't mind.
Advice?

43
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,413
From now on,
hands on the wheel,
eyes on that road.

44
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,221
Okay? Wheel, road.
All right.

45
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:19,562
<i>- No, no, no, no!
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.</i>

46
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,766
<i>Oh, ladies. Hello.
What?</i>

47
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,436
Please accept this gift
on behalf of the city
of Chicago.

48
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,174
Thank you very much,
and have a nice day. Bye!

49
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,449
<i>Hey! Think fast.</i>

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,421
Lou, Lou, Lou.

51
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,684
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

52
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,918
That new bit
about your cousin Al?

53
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,929
<i>That was genius.
Thank you.</i>

54
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,056
You see that guy's face
when you said a million-five?

55
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,793
Yeah!

56
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,438
<i>You know, Lou,
that was your best hit ever!
Thank you.</i>

57
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:03,032
<i>Not only that,
now we can eat
something tonight, huh?</i>

58
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,101
<i>Well, now that depends
on who won the exacta
in the sixth.</i>

59
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,113
<i>Oh, no, not again.</i>

60
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,809
Sammy swore to me
that that jockey
was paid off!

61
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,113
Lou, you don't bet horses.
You bet dogs.
I know.

62
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,120
Horses are a...
A gamble.

63
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,122
Dogs are a...
Investment.

64
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,181
Smart guys
are dog guys.
Dog guys. I know.

65
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,250
Hello, Lou!
No!

66
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,626
Hey, hey, easy, easy.
Pink, easy.

67
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,429
He don't call me,
bet a grand and stand me up
for three days.

68
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,699
I want it all,
and I want it now!
Did you hear that, Lou?

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,702
<i>That's what I admire
about this man.</i>

70
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,472
The directness,
the ability
to express urgency.

71
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,105
Very important
when running a business.

72
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,115
You think you're funny.

73
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:47,619
Sal Nichols
is gonna tear your head off.
Is that funny enough for you?

74
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,247
That's very funny.
Louis.

75
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,084
Can I have
your money, please?

76
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,732
Thank you.

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,894
That's 266.
So we owe Mr. Nichols what?

78
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,336
What do I look like,
a rocket scientist?

79
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,532
All right, uh, $734.

80
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,544
He's gonna have it
tomorrow.

81
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,979
- You'd better, 'cause I
don't like you guys.
- Really? Hmm.

82
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,018
'Cause we like you.
We should hang out.
I'm not just saying that.

83
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,849
And you know what?
Lately you look good.

84
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:26,324
Did you change your hair
or lose some weight?
Whatever it is, it works.

85
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,826
Tomorrow!

86
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,661
Louis.

87
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,731
<i>Where are we gonna get
700 bucks, huh?</i>

88
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,311
- Yeah?
- Bob Marley,
Lakeshore Utility.

89
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,914
We've got
a class-A level gas leak
in the neighborhood.

90
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,925
Get a reading,
Tommy!
Right!

91
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:04,053
- Uh, wait a second.
- Apologize for
the inconvenience, sir.

92
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,223
Excuse me...
It cannot be helped.

93
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,529
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
How long is this gonna take?

94
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,569
No way
of telling that.

95
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,070
- Smell that? Whoo!
- Hmm.

96
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,403
<i>I don't smell anything.
Because you've been here
the whole time.</i>

97
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,967
Anyone else here?
Children, dogs, fish?

98
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,378
My wife took the kids
to their karate lesson.
What are you getting?

99
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,542
<i>High readings.
Oh, hell.</i>

100
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,553
Is that bad?

101
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,987
Where's that furnace?

102
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,991
It's in the basement.
This way.

103
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,392
Tommy, check every room,
and make sure that it is safe.

104
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,828
This way. Come on.
All right.
Just don't touch me.

105
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,868
<i>Whoo!</i>

106
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,076
What's that?
That's the dryer.

107
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,339
Clothes dryer?
Yes. It's electric.

108
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,608
You don't sound too sure.
No, it's electric.

109
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,750
<i>- What's that?
- That's my...my lawn mower.</i>

110
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,344
How long you had it?
I don't know.

111
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,356
A couple years. Why?

112
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,325
Could be nothing.
What is going on?

113
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,260
<i>Maybe you should tell me.</i>

114
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:18,098
Well, looks like 12-gauge,
7.1 hardened steel.

115
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,941
Less than six inches
off the ground.

116
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,842
- Does it always make
that sound?
- Is that dangerous?

117
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,981
<i>- There it is.
- What?</i>

118
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,111
<i>Bob, get up here!
I've got a gas pocket!</i>

119
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,284
I can't! I just pushed
the gas-flow igniter!

120
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,885
I need you right now!
This whole house could blow up!

121
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,056
<i>Oh, Jesus!
Come here, come here,
come here.</i>

122
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,458
Put your finger
on this button.
Come on.

123
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,667
Now, do not let go
of that button.
Do you understand me?

124
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,264
Whatever happens,
do not let go.
Right.

125
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,333
I-I-I understand.
I understand.

126
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,539
Come on.

127
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:10,254
All right.
All right, all right, okay.
Easy.

128
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,158
<i>What's going on?</i>

129
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,162
Uh, nothing
to worry about.

130
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,098
Just decompressing
the gas pocket.
Decompressing the gas?

131
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,261
Stan!
We're home, honey!
Oh.

132
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,271
<i>Don't come in!
There's a gas pocket!</i>

133
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,172
<i>It's okay, though.
The men are here.</i>

134
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,609
Why do they have
our television?

135
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,705
Ain't this one of them
new gas TVs?

136
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,580
I'm calling the police.
Hah!
Hah!

137
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,748
Now, uh, just
take it easy, kids.

138
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,087
- We don't wanna hurt you.
- Hah!

139
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,184
Eddie, let's
get out of here!

140
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,799
Stan, get upstairs!

141
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,392
Boys, be careful!

142
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,803
Go, go, go! Go!
Kids, be careful!

143
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:04,400
Boys, come back!
Yah!
Yah!

144
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,791
<i>Let's not ever...</i>

145
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,856
tell anyone
what just happened.

146
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,238
What are you doing?
What?
Check it out.

147
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,801
<i>No lights on, newspapers,
no killer kids...</i>

148
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,246
Bida-bing-bam-boom.
No, no.
We are not break-in men, Lou.

149
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,250
We are con artists.
All right?

150
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,754
Eddie, this is no time
for splitting hairs.
I got Pinkie all over me, man.

151
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm in the mood for a good,
old-fashioned burglary.
No, no.

152
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,791
This is not
your field, okay?

153
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:56,054
I would rather be
a live burglar...

154
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,119
than a dead
con artist.

155
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,027
- Come on.
- No. No. No.

156
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:19,880
You're a surgeon, Lou.
Excuse me.

157
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,615
Yeah.

158
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,166
Careful.

159
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,465
Ah! Go! Get out!

160
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,015
Shut it! Shh!

161
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,212
I just shut...
I'm sorry.
Okay. All right.

162
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,051
God!
Oh, Eddie, man,

163
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,149
look at this place.

164
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,161
<i>Oh, my God.
Someone lives here.</i>

165
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,220
Yes.
And I hate them for it.

166
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,095
God, this place
has everything. Oh.

167
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,103
<i>Look at that.
Take what you have to take,
and let's get the hell out.</i>

168
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,162
Okay. Decisions, decisions.

169
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,942
<i>Eddie. Eddie,
give me a hand.</i>

170
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,501
<i>All right, all right.
Ow. Shine the light.</i>

171
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,276
Okay. CD player.
An excellent choice.
Thanks.

172
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,783
<i>Hi, you've reached David Malkin.
I'm off to India.</i>

173
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,794
I'll be gone a few months,
but you can leave a message
forJonathan Albertson.

174
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,422
<i>He'll be staying
at the house.
Thanks.</i>

175
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,523
<i>Go. Let's go. Go.</i>

176
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,534
<i>David, it's Jonathan.</i>

177
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:47,265
<i>You probably missed this call,
but they upped that offer
on thatjob in Seattle,</i>

178
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,534
<i>and I couldn't pass up
the big bucks.
Go.</i>

179
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,577
<i>The nub of it is,
I can't house-sit
for you.</i>

180
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,842
<i>What?
As Pericles said
to the Athenians,</i>

181
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,043
<i>"Let each man receive
according to his merits. "</i>

182
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,053
<i>That's me, pal.
C'est la vie.</i>

183
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,383
<i>Good thing</i>

184
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:16,064
<i>Eddie. Creamsicles.
This guy really does
have everything.</i>

185
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,036
As Pericles
said to the Athenians,

186
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,835
I really need another beer.

187
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,070
<i>Okay.
This is the life.</i>

188
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,339
Really.
When I hit it big,
I'm gonna get this.

189
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,645
Big screen TV. Same deal.
Pool table, wife, kids.

190
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:35,016
Me too. Same deal.
TV, wife, kids.

191
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,987
I'm afraid.

192
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,993
Eddie, the guy's in India.

193
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,859
No, that's not it.

194
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,262
It's the idea of you
having children.

195
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,666
That's one of
the most frightening things
I've ever heard of in my life.

196
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,328
Ooh!

197
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,668
All right,
let's go see Max.

198
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,676
<i>Breaking and entering.</i>

199
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:03,443
<i>What did you do,
take stupid pills?
You got the gift.</i>

200
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,451
I knew you had it
when you brought home
your first bicycle.

201
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,578
What were you,
eight?

202
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,817
You can play people
like a Stradivarius.

203
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,383
But that guy back there
is a plumber.
Oh, no. No, not this again.

204
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,895
Now, come on.
He's my friend.
Loyalty I like.

205
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,897
He's my friend!
But that guy's a bozo.

206
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,628
You've been carrying him
since you were 11.
You need a new partner.

207
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,160
Well, you could always
come out of retirement. Huh?
Eddie... Don't tempt me.

208
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,231
Come on.
The good old days were great!
Let's move those legs!

209
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,800
I'm an old guy.
Come on. Cut it out.

210
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,369
I was good, wasn't I?
Yeah, you were.

211
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,076
You know, Eddie,
when you were little...

212
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,086
you know,
before your mother died...

213
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,645
I made her a promise
that I wouldn't raise a bum.

214
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,658
You did good, Max.
Well, maybe I did,
and maybe I didn't.

215
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,661
I just taught
you all I knew
like I would my own son.

216
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,664
I know that.
It's just that...

217
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,064
Sometimes I feel there's
got to be more out there...

218
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,104
than picking up
chump change
at car accidents.

219
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:04,700
Of course there is. The world
is full of opportunities
for a bright young man.

220
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,713
Bank scams, stock swindles.
Those are the big ones.

221
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,773
I mean, that's what life
is all about, kid.

222
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,376
Hey, Max.
Yeah?

223
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,883
Can I have my wallet?

224
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,759
I still got it,
don't I?

225
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:27,526
Velvet hands.
Nice touch.

226
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,534
Eddie.

227
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,595
How about my watch?

228
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,301
I got no damn shot.

229
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,374
You're bad luck, Farrel.

230
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,990
If I hadn't seen this today,
Sal would've had me bury you.

231
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,391
You can't even bury
an eight ball, Pinkie.

232
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,094
Put your money
where your mouth is,
chooch.

233
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:09,738
<i>Well, sweet little Mary
was just 13</i>

234
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,504
<i>Can you spot me a 20?
Walkin'down the street
she'd make a good man mean</i>

235
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,046
<i>Take a truthin'man
and she could
make him a liar</i>

236
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,083
<i>She could take the coolest cat
and set his soul on fire
It's all yours.</i>

237
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,414
<i>Mercy, little baby
now I'm down on my knees</i>

238
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,546
<i>You got me workin'
every night, baby
tryin'to please</i>

239
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,090
<i>It's good work
if you can get it</i>

240
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,218
<i>It's good work...
Oh, man. Oh, man.</i>

241
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,286
<i>Uh, uh, oh, oh.</i>

242
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,696
<i>It's good work
if you can get it</i>

243
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,702
<i>It's good work
if you can get it
Baby, just let it work</i>

244
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,204
<i>Let it work, let it work
let it work, let it work</i>

245
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,469
It was lucky.
I don't pay luck.

246
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,067
<i>And don't let me see
your ugly faces again!</i>

247
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,204
Hey, hey.
Easy. Easy!

248
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,647
Come on.
Come on!
Big turd.

249
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,477
Jerk.

250
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,458
Heh. Huh?

251
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,989
Louis,
what are you doing?

252
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,293
Autographing Pinkie's car.

253
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,596
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Th-That's not nice.

254
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,262
Let's do something nice
for the guy.

255
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,431
Let's give Pinkie
a convertible.

256
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,638
<i>I said, hey, babe
take a walk on the wild side</i>

257
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,615
<i>And the colored girls say
Doo doo doo doo doo</i>

258
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:29,216
<i>Doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo</i>

259
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:36,517
Doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo

260
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,190
<i>Eddie, don't.
Don't answer it.</i>

261
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,825
Eddie, resist the temptation
just this once.

262
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,892
<i>I can't. Why not?
You can.
Just this once.</i>

263
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,200
Come on. I have to. Uh...
Hello.

264
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,502
Greetings.
My name is Tagra.

265
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,043
Am I talking to the jerk
who stole my car?

266
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,511
Listen, scumbag...
He's really pissed.
Great.

267
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,572
I do not appreciate
your profanity.

268
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,742
If you wish to continue
this conversation,

269
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,548
may I suggest a new attitude,
one more positive?

270
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,556
Listen to me,
jerk face...
I am talking!

271
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,558
You do not talk when I talk.

272
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,857
You do not talk when I talk.
When I talk, you do not talk.

273
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,921
It is very simple.
When I talk, you do not talk.

274
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,933
Now, who am I talking to?

275
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,935
Hey, punk, this is
Sal Nichols,

276
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,937
and you'd better
shut your mouth and listen.
Ohhh.

277
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,735
Oh, I am speaking
with Sal Nichols,
and you want your car.

278
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,902
<i>Sal Nichols?
Hang up. Hang up!</i>

279
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,811
<i>Ah! Oh! Ah!
Sal Nichols!
Oh, great!</i>

280
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,815
Pull over.
Where?

281
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,579
Here!
Anywhere! Pull over!

282
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,485
Let's go.
Let's go! Eddie!
Let's go!

283
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,785
Run!
Come on, Eddie!

284
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,139
It's insured, Sal.

285
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,390
It's only 500 deductible.

286
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,154
Hey, I'll pay it myself.
Mr. Marino,

287
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,324
the automobile
is only part
of a greater problem.

288
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,300
There was $60,000
in the trunk.

289
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,998
- Now, how many times
have you been instructed...

290
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,736
<i>not to leave my collections
in the trunk, scumbag?</i>

291
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,574
Wait a minute, Sal.
I know who did this.

292
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,342
It was a couple of creeps
I been doing business with.

293
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,509
Eddie Farrel and Lou Pasquino.
They're the guys you want,
not me!

294
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,884
Your business practice
has become a source
of great irritation to me,

295
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,254
and I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to
relieve you...

296
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,555
of your financial
responsibilities.

297
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,563
Ah! Ooh! Oh! Ah!

298
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:34,399
<i>Find Mr. Farrel
and Mr. Pasquino.</i>

299
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,737
<i>I want my money back.</i>

300
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,216
Eddie,
where are we goin'?

301
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,880
We'll know when we get there.

302
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,116
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

303
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,396
Get the lights.

304
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,434
<i>Open the door!</i>

305
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,437
Let's go.
Oh... Uh...

306
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,531
<i>What you want?
Sal Nichols wants his money!</i>

307
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,600
Money? What?
Sorry. Got no money.

308
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,643
You two jerks
took $60,000
out of his trunk.

309
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,706
Sixty thou...
Sixty... Let's go!

310
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,809
I wonder
what he's talkin' about.
Oh.

311
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,151
Jerks not here.
No-Nobody here.
Eddie!

312
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,748
Uh, they let me stay
because I am leper.

313
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,986
I am leper.
Oh, very bad disease.

314
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,621
<i>Got bump everywhere.
Don't look good.
Let's go!</i>

315
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,325
Oh, yeah. You stay out.
I make it simple:

316
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,891
Come in, bump;
stay out, no bump.
Your decision!

317
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,978
It's not going down.
It'll go down.

318
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,277
Eddie, what's wrong
with this thing?
Come on.

319
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,324
Eddie!

320
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,921
We missed 'em, goddamn it!

321
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,139
We gotta get out of here.
Right.

322
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,201
What the hell you doin'?
What?

323
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,181
- Eddie!
- What?

324
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,979
<i>Later!</i>

325
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,850
<i>Much later.</i>

326
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,894
Hello?
Uncle Max, it's me.

327
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,496
You okay?
Don't worry. I'm fine.
I'm fine. Listen.

328
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,769
If Lou calls...
He did?
He just called.

329
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,437
Eddie, are you in trouble?
Then where is he?

330
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:31,107
I have no idea.
Okay, that doesn't
matter now. Listen.

331
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,119
<i>If he calls again,
tell him that I am at
the stereo house.</i>

332
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,553
"Stereo house"?
He'll know what I mean.

333
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,147
You're at the stereo house.
Okay.
Okay.

334
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:44,218
<i>Thanks, Max.</i>

335
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,497
<i>Oh, God.</i>

336
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,678
Take a hike.
Hey, I was browsing.

337
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,421
Hi!
Ahh!
Come in

338
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,221
And pull yourself up a chair
Like Chairry!

339
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:19,491
Let the fun begin
It's time to let down
your hair

340
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,998
Pee-Wee's
sure excited
Uh-huh.

341
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,331
All his friends
have been invited
That's you!

342
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:29,340
It's so wacky
at Pee-Wee's Playhouse
Uhhh!

343
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,342
There's
a crazy rhythm

344
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,503
Comin' from Puppetland
What's that?

345
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,848
<i>Oh, God, that sucks.</i>

346
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,984
<i>It's a cruel, crazy
beautiful world</i>

347
00:24:56,061 --> 00:25:00,760
<i>Every day you wake up
I hope it's under a blue sky</i>

348
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,060
<i>It's a cruel, crazy
beautiful world</i>

349
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:17,108
<i>Wow.</i>

350
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,363
I'll just be
a minute, honey.

351
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,910
Oh! Doh! Ooh. Oh.

352
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,953
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I must be in the wrong house.

353
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,821
Oh, no,
you're in the right house.

354
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,486
Oh. I'm so sorry,
but you scared me to death.

355
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,723
<i>David said
you were coming tomorrow.</i>

356
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,924
<i>Oh, this is David's house.</i>

357
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,093
Oh, what a relief. Oh.

358
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,162
- Well, then you must be, uh...
Now, don't tell me.
- Mona.

359
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,266
<i>Mona!
Mona!</i>

360
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,277
Oh, I-I heard a scream.

361
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,371
It's all right, honey.
I'm fine.

362
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:27,407
Jonathan Albertson,
I'd like you to meet
my favorite husband Milton.

363
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,476
Jonathan Albertson?

364
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:34,519
<i>Well, nice to meet you,
Milton. Milt.
Milt.</i>

365
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,433
Well... Mona and Milt.

366
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,594
<i>David's parents.
Oh, of course!</i>

367
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,470
It's just that I always
think of you as Milt and Mona.

368
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,238
Well, we just came over
to leave you a welcome note.

369
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,246
But now that we've got you
in our clutches,

370
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,044
you absolutely must come
for lunch at the club.
Mm-hmm.

371
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,086
Oh, I can't.
I mean, I would
love to, of course,

372
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,247
but, uh, I'm pretty lagged out
from the flight, and, uh,

373
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:09,157
the limo didn't meet me
at the airport, and they
scratched one of my good bags.

374
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:13,323
- Oh, poor baby.
- Oh, it gets worse.

375
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,696
They lost another one
of my bags,

376
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,669
with my wallet and all
my credit cards and... Oh!

377
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,206
The nub of it is,
it's like losing your identity.

378
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:26,039
<i>It's been a complete nightmare.
C'est la vie.</i>

379
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,739
I love it!
He's broke!

380
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,613
One of the rising young stars
in American business,
and he needs a loan.

381
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,915
What do you want? One?
What, you want two?

382
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,615
Oh, I-I couldn't.
You want three?

383
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,920
<i>Here. You're good for it,
aren't you?
Oh, Milt.</i>

384
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,655
Now, front door, back door,
and the car's in the garage.

385
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,495
<i>All right.
Now you have no reason
not to have lunch with us.</i>

386
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,580
<i>Another sun was shining
and he knew he wasn't great</i>

387
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,647
<i>He didn't ever talk about
he knew he couldn't wait</i>

388
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,294
<i>Time is running out
the illusion fades away</i>

389
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,696
<i>Time is running out
another day is on its way</i>

390
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,805
I can't wait
for you two to meet.
Mom, I'm sure I'm not his type.

391
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,815
Well, if his type is
a nice, intelligent girl,
you're his type.

392
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,216
Mom, David said that he
used to date Miss Texas.

393
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,551
If you think
that I'm gonna
twirl a baton...

394
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,955
and sing the national anthem
in a bikini for this guy,
you're crazy.

395
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,586
I used to do that
for your father.
Didn't I, Milt?

396
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,995
<i>Leave her alone, Mona.
Jonathan!</i>

397
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,466
Hi.
Oh. Jonathan.

398
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,560
Glad you made it.
Come.
Milt.

399
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,832
<i>Welcome.
Hi, Jonathan.</i>

400
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:06,002
Jonathan,
this is Annie.

401
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,877
Well, I always thought
David was exaggerating.

402
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,406
<i>- He wasn't.
- And, uh,</i>

403
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,477
we've heard aboutJonathan
since David's freshman year,
haven't we?

404
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,920
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

405
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,221
Uh, it's nice
to finally put a face...

406
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,352
to the reputation.

407
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,924
Well, I, uh, hope
I can live up to
at least a little bit...

408
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,969
of what David
has told you all about me.

409
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,130
- He told us you were single.
That's a good first step.

410
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,231
Mr. Malkin,
your table is ready.
Oh.

411
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,242
Table's ready.
Great.

412
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,471
Thank you, Cyril.

413
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,038
Why don't we celebrate?
My good man,

414
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,311
as Pericles said
to the Athenians,

415
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,512
where do I drain
the lizard?

416
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,114
Thanks.

417
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,133
Hey, hey.
How many sinks
do you need?

418
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,077
Does this cost anything?
It's complimentary, sir.

419
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:23,313
Hmm.

420
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,000
Jonathan Albertson.
Pleasure to meet ya.

421
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,430
Jonathan, I've got to
ask you something.

422
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,869
Phillips made you
the youngest V.P. ever, right?

423
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,404
<i>And you walk away
to take a shot
at something better.</i>

424
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,250
<i>Now, that takes guts.
Hey, hey.</i>

425
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,584
<i>So, tell me,
what are you after now?</i>

426
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,923
<i>Well, negotiating
a few oil leases up north.</i>

427
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,896
You must be familiar with
the U.S. oil lease program,
huh, Milt?

428
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,196
- Could be the bonanza.
- Risky business.
Wouldn't put a dime in it.

429
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,566
Yeah, it has a downside.
I agree. I agree.

430
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,003
That's why I'm, uh,
really leaning...

431
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,565
toward a very interesting
situation in Mexican coins.

432
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,976
Come on, Jonathan.
What I'm interested in
are those interviews.

433
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:07,746
<i>You turned down
Procter & Gamble, AT&T,
Colonial Insurance. Why?</i>

434
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,847
<i>Why? Why?
Yes, why?</i>

435
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,253
Why? Milt.

436
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,193
I think we're boring the ladies.

437
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,758
Thank you, Jonathan.

438
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,331
- Mr. Malkin.
- Jonathan, I understand
you're the great sommelier.

439
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,535
<i>So why don't you do the honors.</i>

440
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,940
Well, it's, uh...
it's been a while
since I, uh,

441
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,246
"sommeliered."

442
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,548
Actually, most of my equipment
is still in storage.

443
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,384
"Equipment is
in storage."

444
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,455
<i>Well, uh...
Yeah, I'll have
this one right here.</i>

445
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:59,001
Excuse me,
but that is the address
of the wine distributor.

446
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,062
Yeah. How about this one?

447
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,376
That is
the surcharge, sir.

448
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:10,813
May I suggest something
a little higher up on the page?

449
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,875
Chateau Lafite.

450
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,817
<i>Oh. Excellent.
Excellent.</i>

451
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,755
Hope everybody's thirsty.

452
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,088
<i>Annie, the beeper again?</i>

453
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,254
<i>Are you the only doctor
they have down there?</i>

454
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,456
Dad, I'll be right back.

455
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,761
<i>Wow, a doctor.
You two must be very proud
of that girl.</i>

456
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,635
Yeah. Sometimes I think
she works too hard.
Mm.

457
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:40,439
Hey, you know, if you ask me,
hard work and dedication
is what it is all about.

458
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,378
- Look at Elvis.
- Who?

459
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,315
<i>Elvis. Elvis Presley.</i>

460
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,318
Thirty-five platinum albums.

461
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,946
Ha-Had his...
Had his own floor at Caesar's.

462
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,457
Really?

463
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,857
Mrs. Gonzalez
is having her baby.

464
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,921
Annie, you practically donate
your time. You have to do it
in the middle of lunch?

465
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,966
Dad, calm down.

466
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,264
Listen, I'll tell you what.

467
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,703
If it's a boy,
I'll suggest
Milt Gonzalez.

468
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,970
Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

469
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:16,605
- Good-bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Jonathan.

470
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,047
Bye.
Chateau Lafite.

471
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,390
- Think he'll come back
and burp me after lunch, Milt?

472
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,571
What are you
saving it for there, slim?
Come on, come on.

473
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:45,398
Yeah.

474
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,053
Wow! That is incredible!

475
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,388
<i>You guys
gotta try this. Mm!</i>

476
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,863
<i>Thirty-five years ago,
my father started
making hand dryers.</i>

477
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,331
<i>And today,
aside from making blowers,</i>

478
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,336
we make over 18%
of all the bathroom stalls
in the U.S.,

479
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,896
thirteen percent
of all the fixtures
and accessories.

480
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:21,377
But still, our high profit item
is the classic Malkin Blower.

481
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,811
Mr. Malkin, Mr. Malkin.

482
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,145
Mr. Harris
finished his meeting
with Mr. Nimaku.

483
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,516
The interpreter left,
but Mr. Nimaku still seems
to have one other question.

484
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,748
Well, we've got the man
right here, Vi.
Great.

485
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,847
Two years
at the Nagasaki office
at Phillips.

486
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,519
Help us out,
will ya, Jon.
Yeah, yeah.

487
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,026
Oh, th-that's easy.
He, uh...

488
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,698
He's saying that he is
happy to be here.
Oh.

489
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:17,493
He b... He's saying
that he admires the power
of the Malkin Blower...

490
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,298
and the way it strikes
the moisture off his hand!

491
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,919
Huh?

492
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,481
Oh, he says
that Malkin Blowers
are number one!

493
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,527
Somebody oughta tell him
what that means in America.
Jesus.

494
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,194
Yeah.

495
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,400
Well, this might seem
like a small operation
compared to Phillips,

496
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,635
but, uh,
we call it home.

497
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,008
It's got a nice view.
It's very nice.
Very nice.

498
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,573
Oh-ho. Milt.

499
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,915
Ernie Banks? Huh?

500
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,420
Color me impressed.

501
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,390
<i>You, from Harvard,
and a Cubs fan?</i>

502
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,949
Thought all you guys did was row
those skinny boats around.

503
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,019
Come on. What,
are you kidding me?

504
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,189
I have been
a loyal Cubs fan
all my life.

505
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,130
How about
that Ernie Banks, huh?

506
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,361
"The Cubs
will shine in '69!"

507
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:28,030
Ha! "Let's play two!"
Ha-ha-ha!
"Let's play two!"

508
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,096
I gotta show you somethin'.

509
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,041
<i>Wait till you see this.</i>

510
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,716
<i>There we go.</i>

511
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,389
Ernie Banks's...

512
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,925
four hundred and ninety-ninth
home run ball.

513
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,403
Number 500
is in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

514
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:08,002
Oh. "Milt... Nice catch.

515
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,071
Ernie Banks, 5/9/70."

516
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,207
Huh.

517
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,275
That's my
most prized possession.

518
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,118
It'd be mine too. Hmm.

519
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,923
Hey, uh,
you ever hear of a bank?

520
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,466
You must have
a hundred grand
sitting here.

521
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,799
It's 180.

522
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,738
<i>Most of my suppliers
are from the old school.</i>

523
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,298
This stuff
is the only thing they trust.

524
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,311
<i>Trust...</i>

525
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,871
is a wonderful thing.

526
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,189
Didn't go for oil.
He didn't go for coins.

527
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,521
I don't know.
I don't know what to do next.

528
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,061
There's a con
for everybody, Eddie.

529
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,529
You just gotta scratch a little.

530
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,624
Why don't you go to work
for the old man?

531
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,829
What am I gonna do,
walk in with a briefcase
and do card tricks?

532
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,895
<i>I know nothing
about business.</i>

533
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,431
Well, you're gonna say
I'm sentimental,
but my intuition tells me...

534
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,637
June's the time
for the love con.

535
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,646
Go for the daughter.

536
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,915
Mm-mm. No way.
She's too smart.

537
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,010
So read a couple of books.

538
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,851
No, this... this chick is cold.

539
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,915
<i>- So warm her up.
- Your Aunt Connie's right.</i>

540
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,757
The way to a man's money
is through his daughter.

541
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,854
That's one of your basics.

542
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,162
And we're not just talking
about the 180 grand.

543
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,829
That's just the tip of
the iceberg. You're building
your future, Eddie.

544
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:44,136
<i>Gee, I remember
my first marriage.</i>

545
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:48,440
I mean, I left him in a motel
in the Poconos.

546
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,879
He was wearing a top hat
and his socks.

547
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:56,818
<i>I hocked our wedding silver,
took your Uncle Max to Bermuda.</i>

548
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,618
It sure beats workin', Eddie.

549
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,550
You know, guys,

550
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,562
I think I'm fallin' in love.

551
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,061
<i>Hi, Harold.
Hiya, Doc.</i>

552
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,832
How you doing today?
I'm all right today.
How are you?

553
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,999
You feel okay?
All right.
Yes, I do, Doc.

554
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,148
Oh, I'm here
for my checkup. Yeah.

555
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,814
<i>I been talking
like this all day.
Wait. Wait.</i>

556
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:36,053
Oh, I'm fine. I guess I just had
to clear my throat. I'm okay.

557
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,762
- What are you doing here?
- Oh.

558
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,493
Actually, Milt tells me
you're doing some
great work down here.

559
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:48,095
Uh-huh.
Oh, my God. Oh!

560
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,538
You look incredible
in a stethoscope.

561
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,304
Does that look like
a barstool to you?

562
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,436
This is not
a pick-up joint. Okay?

563
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,913
It's a clinic.
Now, I really think
you should leave.

564
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,678
Wait, wait.
I didn't come down here
to pick you up.

565
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,616
I don't know where
you got that idea.

566
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,677
I came down here
to, um, uh,

567
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,351
help... help out.

568
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,222
You want to help?

569
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,388
Yeah.
That's wonderful.
Lie down.

570
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,194
<i>Why?
Well,</i>

571
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,258
because you're
gonna give blood.

572
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,634
No! Wrong. Sorry. Eh!
Time out. No, no, no.

573
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,072
No, no. Ha-ha.
I don't do this sort of thing.
I don't have extra blood.

574
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:28,236
Sure, you do. Lie down.
Push up your sleeve.

575
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,110
Does this kind of activity...
Is... Does it hurt?

576
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:35,117
<i>You ever been bit
by one of them big bumblebees?</i>

577
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:39,144
Harold, stop it.
Oh, uh, wait.

578
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,214
Okay, okay.
I got a much better idea.

579
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,489
Wh-Why don't I make some sort
of a financial contribution?

580
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,621
Maybe a portion
of my Alaskan oil profits.

581
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,757
A tax write-off?
Come on. You're a big boy.

582
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,694
<i>Very funny, Harold.
I do my best.</i>

583
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,833
<i>What you in for, Harold?
For going too fast.</i>

584
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:04,404
There are some fine ladies
over at the home still waiting
on old Harold Monroe.

585
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,848
Well, Harold, we'll try
not to disappoint them.
Oh.

586
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:11,410
H-Hold on. No, shouldn't
I drink some whiskey
or bite on a stick or...

587
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:15,151
Ow, ow, ow.
Ah... Ah...

588
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,820
<i>Jonathan?</i>

589
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,262
Well, welcome back.

590
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,327
You're okay.
You just passed out.

591
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,278
Good-bye, Mr. Albertson.

592
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,911
No, ah.
I'll get it.

593
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,552
Hello.

594
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,615
Hello, Mona? Is that you?
This is Jonathan.

595
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,626
Oh! Hello.

596
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:54,460
It is you.
Gosh, you sound so young.
Now, what is your secret?

597
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:58,228
Jonathan, you stop that.
I love it.

598
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:02,261
Listen, how would you and Milt
like to go, uh, waterskiing
this Saturday?

599
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,466
<i>I've made all the arrangements.</i>

600
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,203
Oh, Jonathan,
I'm so sorry.
We can't.

601
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:10,110
It's our nephew's
bar mitzvah
on Saturday.

602
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,411
Wait. Wait, wait.
Why don't you come?
No, no.

603
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,418
That is a family affair.

604
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,216
Jonathan!
Temple Beth Shalom
at 10:00.

605
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,018
You'll get to meet
Annie's favorite bubbie.

606
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,286
All right, all right,
enough twisting my arm.

607
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,523
You've got me, okay?
I'll be there.
See you then. Bye-bye.

608
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,498
Bye.

609
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,096
Temple.

610
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,299
Albertson.

611
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,910
Holy Christ. I'm Jewish.

612
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:55,055
Tradition

613
00:44:55,125 --> 00:45:03,132
<i>Tradition</i>

614
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,837
<i>Traditions,
traditions.</i>

615
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,571
<i>Without our traditions,</i>

616
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:19,810
<i>our lives would be
as shaky as...as...
Oy vey.</i>

617
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,875
as a fiddler
on the roof.

618
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,509
So, why don't...

619
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:55,348
I would like to dance
with the most ravishing woman
in the world.

620
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,387
I'm sorry...
Bubbie,
what do you say?

621
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,116
Ooh-hoo!
Oh, how he talks!

622
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,181
Let's go.

623
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,855
Milt, what's the matter?

624
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,923
Nothing.
Milt.

625
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:15,538
Look at him.
Jonathan.
Who? Ah.

626
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:20,168
<i>I would give five V.P. s for one,
oneJonathan Albertson.</i>

627
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,508
Milt, will you leave
the office already?

628
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,605
Jonathan is David's friend.
Now, don't be pestering him.

629
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,344
Come on.
Give me a smile.

630
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,545
<i>Terrific.</i>

631
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,557
We went to McDonald's.

632
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,560
She was still trying to order
the dim sum dumplings.

633
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,994
At McDonald's yet!
Crazy!

634
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,588
What is so funny,
you two?

635
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,793
Oh, we decided
you're too serious.

636
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,859
Go. Enjoy.

637
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:54,069
So, if at first
you don't succeed,
work on the bubbie, huh?

638
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,237
Guilty. What can I say?
Come on.

639
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,304
Please, let's just
have some fun.

640
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,647
This is as fun as I get.

641
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:05,119
Really? So then
you're gonna make me...

642
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,123
go out here all by myself?

643
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:11,059
You know, I'm very nervous
on a dance floor.
I don't really know how.

644
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,653
<i>When I look
into your eyes</i>

645
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,995
<i>So much passion
burns inside</i>

646
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:20,935
<i>If you need some coaxing
I will do it</i>

647
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:25,202
<i>Step by step
there's nothing to it</i>

648
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,438
<i>One, two, three, four
Come on, baby
say you love me</i>

649
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,844
<i>Five, six, seven times</i>

650
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,950
<i>Eight, nine
ten, eleven</i>

651
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,281
<i>- I'm just gonna
keep on counting</i>

652
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,550
<i>Until you are mine</i>

653
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,716
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

654
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:45,455
<i>Come on, baby
say you love me
Five, six, seven times</i>

655
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,624
<i>Eight, nine, ten, eleven</i>

656
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,500
<i>I'm just gonna
keep on counting
until you are mine</i>

657
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:00,572
Oh, hey, there.
There it was.
You definitely laughed.

658
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,509
That was a big laugh,
and, really,

659
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,672
this is a very
solemn occasion,

660
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,581
and I may have to report you
to the Solemn Occasion Police.

661
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:11,178
Uh, that wasn't a laugh.
I was yawning.

662
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:14,019
No, I have to disagree.
It was most definitely a laugh.

663
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,959
Okay, but it was more
a "Boy, what an idiot" laugh.

664
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,656
Really? Boy,
I could've swore it was a...

665
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,360
"My God, he's incredibly
charming,"and"How do I
get to know him better?" laugh.

666
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:28,165
There it is again. That's two.
I'm on a roll. I'm very happy.

667
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,298
David never mentioned
this side of you.

668
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,244
Well, uh, there's
a few things about me...

669
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,509
that might surprise
even David.

670
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,581
<i>Eddie?</i>

671
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,678
Eddie!

672
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,054
You couldn't say "Meet me
at the pinball machine house,"

673
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,060
or the pool table house.

674
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,120
Or "Meet me at
the Creamsicle house."
That I would've known.

675
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,536
Eddie. Oh.

676
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,818
Now, remember,
don't tell Mona.
She'll never know.

677
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,224
"Tilt"?

678
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,023
<i>Great.</i>

679
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,965
- Well, it's about time!
- Lou!

680
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,170
Uh... what the hell
are you doing here?

681
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,968
Sal Nichols
has a contract
out on us.

682
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:40,305
<i>Oh, great.
That contract
came through.</i>

683
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:43,369
That's terrific.
I'll have my lawyers
check on that in the morning.

684
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,142
<i>Ah.
Uh, Milt.</i>

685
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,707
I would like you
to meet Lou Pasquino.
Milt Malkin.

686
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:52,016
<i>Milt.
How do you do?</i>

687
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,421
Lou's my broker.

688
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,817
<i>Hey, kill the music, and, uh,</i>

689
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,829
why don't you get us
a couple of beers?

690
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,058
We have a lot
to talk about.
Beers.

691
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,124
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

692
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:11,040
<i>He had a complete
nervous breakdown.</i>

693
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,339
Totally wiped out
on Black Monday.
You're kidding.

694
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:18,074
Well, this won't take long.
I just wanted to show you
some sales charts.

695
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,640
All right.

696
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,017
Now, these are the, uh,
the sales projections...

697
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:28,888
and inventory totals
of the past two quarters.

698
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,052
You've got that sideways.
There you go.

699
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,296
Well, you...

700
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,561
you said you wanted
a fresh perspective, right?
Mm-hmm.

701
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,568
Well, this is serious.

702
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:43,697
Turn it this way,
like I had it, it looks like
the Rocky Mountains. I mean...

703
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,068
My God, you put
your finger right on it.

704
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,808
These have been
the most erratic sales figures
that we've had in 35 years.

705
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,873
We don't have
a snowball's chance
in hell...

706
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,646
of getting a, uh,
a sales budget
under these conditions.

707
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,656
I don't want to make you
uncomfortable.

708
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,922
I know the big guys
are after you, but,
damn it, I need you.

709
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:09,329
You walk into my company,
you're vice president
in charge of marketing.

710
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,390
Me?
Yes.

711
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,436
Well...
Excuse me, Milt.
What are you movin'?

712
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,664
Nothing's moving.
That's the problem.

713
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,470
You're a broker?
I am a broker.

714
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,909
What's your specialty?

715
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,242
Oh, whatever you need.

716
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:26,441
Take a look at these babies.

717
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,507
Oh, Lou,
you're great.

718
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,043
Chicago, Tokyo, London.
This guy lives the market.

719
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:35,091
Oh, I don't believe it!
Look how late it's gotten.

720
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,594
Milt, do you mind
if we do this, uh,
in a day or two?

721
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:42,257
We sure can, as long as
it's in your new office.

722
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,527
I'm not leaving
until you say yes.

723
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:51,106
I'll give it a try.

724
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,870
Oh, Jon.

725
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,208
Jon.
Oh, that's beautiful.

726
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,543
Wonderful. We're gonna be
a hell of a team.
I know.

727
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,845
<i>I know it too.
What great news.</i>

728
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,750
Monday morning,
Mr. Vice President.

729
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,254
I'll be looking
forward to it.

730
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,888
Eddie, you got
a coaster on your head.

731
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:19,060
According to all the research
done for hand dryer
and bathroom accessories,

732
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,162
name-brand recognition
is still the key factor.

733
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,208
Look at the third survey,
page seven.

734
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,733
The company has
no alternative but to increase
advertising expenditures...

735
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,746
in the third quarter.

736
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,306
That's a $3-million price tag
we're talking about,
just to remain competitive.

737
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,375
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it a second.

738
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,420
I'm hearing the same old B.S.
I'm always hearing.

739
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,522
Jonathan,

740
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:49,156
<i>I know you've had those figures
for only a few hours, but, uh,</i>

741
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,598
we sure could use
a fresh perspective around here.

742
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:03,108
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

743
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,078
I don't really have
anything to say...

744
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,351
i-in here.

745
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:24,466
Look, I don't spend
a lot of time in boardrooms.

746
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,305
Why don't we all
adjourn this meeting...

747
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,706
to a place we're a little more
familiar with, hmm?

748
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:37,213
<i>All right, come on.
Come on. Everybody in.</i>

749
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,942
Ladies too.
Don't be shy.
Don't be shy.

750
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:43,247
Now, I want you all
to go in those stalls
and close the door.

751
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,421
Come on.
Double up if you have to.

752
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,980
Milt, I'd like you
in this one
right over here.

753
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,056
Jonathan,
this better be good.

754
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,964
Okay, that's right.
Go in. Take a seat.

755
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:02,130
<i>Take a seat
and close the doors.
Excellent.</i>

756
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:05,003
Now, at Harvard
we call this...

757
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,568
field research.

758
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:14,777
Milt, will you please tell us
what you see in front of you.

759
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,445
A door.

760
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,752
A Malkin door.
And what else?

761
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:26,828
<i>- Who the hell wrote this?
- Come on.</i>

762
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,091
What does it say?

763
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:33,124
"Milt Malkin...
is full of hot air."

764
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,262
<i>Now, that...</i>

765
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,397
is an advertising message.

766
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:41,274
Not necessarily the message
we're trying to get across,

767
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,778
but a message.

768
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:48,750
You see, the average person
spends seven and a half minutes
of every day...

769
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:52,345
staring at the back
of a bathroom door.

770
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:57,359
And we can write anything
we want on 18% of those doors
sold in America.

771
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:59,418
Why?

772
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,456
'Cause we make 'em.

773
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,802
That's seven and a half minutes
of every day,

774
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,363
three hundred
and sixty-five days a year,

775
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,103
for an average life span
of 72 years.

776
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:18,045
<i>That's 3,280 hours
of a captive audience...</i>

777
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:22,312
at a time when they're
most open to new ideas.

778
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,577
Because we all know...

779
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,351
that your major
life decisions...

780
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:31,724
aren't made in the boardroom!

781
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,124
No. They're made...

782
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,926
in the bathroom.

783
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,142
<i>Yeah!</i>

784
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,415
<i>Jonathan!</i>

785
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,185
<i>Let me say since</i>

786
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:07,663
Since we've been together

787
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:11,861
Ooh, lovin' you forever

788
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:19,031
<i>Is all I need</i>

789
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,510
<i>Oh, let me be the one
You know what? This has
been an incredible date.</i>

790
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,104
<i>You come runnin'to
Wait a second.
This isn't a date.</i>

791
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,115
Well, then what is it?

792
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:30,641
This is merely the sister
of your best friend
showing you a good time.

793
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,654
A good time.
Yeah.

794
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,123
<i>What else
did you have in mind?
Let's stay together</i>

795
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:38,558
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

796
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,428
<i>Lovin'you whether
Whether
Just sit back, relax...</i>

797
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,660
<i>and enjoy the show.
Times are good or bad</i>

798
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,668
<i>Excuse me.
Happy or sad</i>

799
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,863
Thank you.
Thank you.

800
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:52,430
<i>Oh, baby, let's</i>

801
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:56,138
<i>Let's stay together</i>

802
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,807
<i>Lovin'you whether</i>

803
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,408
Oh, whether

804
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,419
<i>Times are good or bad
Brad!</i>

805
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:06,853
<i>Happy or sad
Give me another one
of these, will ya.</i>

806
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,857
<i>All right, all right.
Come on. Hurry up.</i>

807
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,088
Happy or sad, ooh

808
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,761
<i>Michelle! Let's hear it
for Michelle! All right!</i>

809
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,128
Ladies and gentlemen,
night after night...

810
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:23,366
we get some very,
very talented people
to come up from the audience...

811
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,670
<i>and tear up the stage.</i>

812
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:30,042
<i>Tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
we have with us a star.
Oh, yeah!</i>

813
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,014
The Wild Man
led one of the finest
rock bands in Boston...

814
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,642
and tore up the lvy League
for four big years,

815
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,881
<i>and I think
if we give him
a big, kick-ass...</i>

816
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,186
Quarry welcome, I think
we can get him up here
to do his thing.

817
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:45,125
<i>What do you say?
Yeah! Yeah!</i>

818
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:49,529
All right!
Come on, Wild Man!
Rock and roll! Whoo!

819
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,693
There he is,
ladies and gentlemen!
Wild Man Albertson!

820
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:59,534
I called them
this afternoon.

821
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,678
What did you tell them?
Just what David said.

822
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:06,874
I wanted to see
if you still had it
in you, Wild Man.

823
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,650
Come on up, Wild Man!
Come on up! Wild Man!

824
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:17,716
<i>Wild Man! Wild Man!
Wild Man! Wild Man!
Wild Man! Wild Man! Wild Man!</i>

825
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:22,060
- I can't go up there.
- Wild Man! Wild Man! Wild Man!

826
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,224
Go on. Go on!

827
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,235
Wild Man!
Wild Man! Wild Man!

828
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:31,262
Wild Man!

829
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,767
What do you
feel like doin', man?

830
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,473
<i>I don't...</i>

831
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:41,176
I got it.

832
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:44,880
Perfect for you,
Wild Man.
Rock and roll.

833
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:57,222
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it's star time!</i>

834
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,436
Get your motor runnin'

835
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,479
<i>Head out on the highway
Farrel?</i>

836
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,572
Looking for adventure

837
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,141
<i>And whatever comes</i>

838
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,346
<i>Our way
Farrel!</i>

839
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:21,948
Yeah, darling
Gonna make it happen!

840
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:24,960
- Take the world
in a love embrace
- You owe me...

841
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,588
<i>60,000 bucks, you punk!
Fire all your guns at once</i>

842
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,859
- And
Louder! Louder!
- Yeah!

843
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:34,529
Give me that thing!
Like a true nature's child

844
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:37,596
We were born
born to be wild
I'm gonna kill you, you lowlife!

845
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,869
I'm gonna poke
your eyes out!

846
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,707
<i>- I never wanna die
- I'll kill you!</i>

847
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:45,339
Come here so I can
poke your eyes out!

848
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,849
Born to be wild

849
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:55,624
Born to be wild

850
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,207
You're not even gonna
be able to...

851
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:16,709
Ow!

852
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,879
I'll poke your eyes out!

853
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,319
I like smoke and lightnin'

854
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,524
Heavy metal thunder

855
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,466
Racing with the wind

856
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:42,368
And the feeling
that I'm under

857
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:46,769
Yeah, darling
gonna make it happen

858
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:50,176
Take the world
in a love embrace

859
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,215
Fire all your guns
at once and

860
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:56,183
Explode into space

861
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,743
Like a true nature's child

862
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,881
We were born
born to be wild

863
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,483
We could climb so high

864
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,393
I never wanna die

865
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,692
Born to be wild

866
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,966
<i>Born to be wild</i>

<i>Born to be wild</i>

873

Why are we running?
Those fans are crazy.

874
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,300
I can't believe this.
What?

875
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,607
I'm actually having
a good time with you.

876
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:59,876
Yeah? Well,
you should see me
on a really good night.

877
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,974
<i>Whoo!</i>

878
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,716
<i>Should've never made
eye contact</i>

879
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:11,021
<i>Should've been
a heart of stone</i>

880
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,586
<i>When you stopped me
to say hello</i>

881
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,429
<i>Would've been twice as easy</i>

882
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:24,302
<i>Tojust say no</i>

883
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:28,275
<i>'Cause I don't wanna lose
at love again</i>

884
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:33,008
<i>Ooh, but as a couple
we were quite handsome</i>

885
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:36,313
<i>And the moon was out
that night</i>

886
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:39,684
<i>So we let our hearts
go dancin'</i>

<i>If the thing that's missin'

<i>There's not enough romance
in this world</i>

889
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:48,630
Oh, my. What was that?

890
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,996
<i>Oh</i>

891
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:55,231
<i>There's not enough romance
in this world</i>

892
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,431
<i>Ooh</i>

893
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:03,241
<i>There's too many people
thinking only of themselves</i>

894
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:06,213
<i>You've gotta give love</i>

01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,220
<i>Wanna sing about new lovers</i>

898
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:23,754
<i>Who stand up
against the odds</i>

899
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:28,099
<i>Mmm, nothing can change
a thing that strong</i>

900
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,531
<i>And myself I know
my emotions</i>

901
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:36,044
<i>I got my love to share</i>

902
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:39,513
<i>And when you're needin'
something so tender</i>

903
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:43,541
<i>What you're looking for
is so rare</i>

904
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,555
<i>There's not enough romance
in this world</i>

905
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,549
<i>No</i>

906
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:53,686
<i>There's not enough romance
in this world</i>

907
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:59,065
John, did you get
those Cubs tickets
for this afternoon? Great.

908
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:01,228
1:30? Absolutely.

909
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:05,297
And listen, they better be
behind the first baseline.
Williamson is a fanatic.

910
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:09,504
I'm sorry, Milt.
Those facts and figures
might impress some executives,

911
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:13,140
but I gotta tell ya,
I'm a people person.

912
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:17,380
And my gut says people
really prefer paper towels.

913
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,944
That 1:30 meeting
all set, Paul?

914
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,252
<i>We're in, Donald.
Well, Milt,</i>

915
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:25,761
if you'll excuse me,
I got a big sales meeting.

916
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,819
I understand.

917
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:37,570
<i>Fresh roasted
and salted shell! Yes, sir.</i>

918
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,371
Yeah! Yeah!
Whoa!

919
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,382
Whoo!
What a catch!

920
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,680
Great catch.
Great catch.
That was close.

921
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:52,812
Yes. Too close.
Hell of an idea,
going to a ball game, Jon.

922
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,188
Hey, all work, no play,
huh, Milt?

923
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:07,495
Milt, look familiar?

924
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:11,401
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

925
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:14,102
<i>He told me he had
a sales meeting.</i>

926
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:16,906
Oh, he does.
He just doesn't know it yet.

927
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,383
Over there.

928
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:47,203
<i>Gentlemen, your attention.
Nobody move, please.</i>

929
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,267
Secret Service.

930
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:54,305
I'm going to ask for
your cooperation in remaining
exactly where you are.

931
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,079
All right, Mr. President.
We're all clear.

932
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,059
Well, thank you, Tom.

933
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,290
You know, that's
quite an exciting ball game
we're seeing.

934
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:11,492
Oh, yes, sir.
It is.
Yes, sir.

935
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:15,560
<i>All righty.
- Paper towel, Mr. President?</i>

936
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,904
Not gonna do it.
Not gonna do it.

937
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,810
Wouldn't be prudent
at this juncture.

938
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:28,043
You know, what do you say
we try that blower thing
over there?

939
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,779
<i>It's right over here,
Mr. President.</i>

940
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:34,220
You know, Bar and I
love these things.

941
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,623
Love... love doing
that blower thing.

942
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:40,423
<i>Good for the hands.
Good for the economy.</i>

943
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:44,694
You know, make a note, Tom.
We'll get one up there
in the White House.

944
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,600
Get one up in Kennebunkport.

945
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,662
Maybe a gift set for Gorby.

946
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:57,645
<i>You know, seems to me,
blowers good,</i>

947
01:06:57,713 --> 01:07:00,682
paper towels bad.

948
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,550
Well, I'm ready
to move along now.

949
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,611
We're moving out.
Mr. President.

950
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,989
Uh, gentlemen, thank you
for your cooperation,
and, uh,

951
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,994
just go back
about your business.

952
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,530
Thank you.

953
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:20,001
I can't believe it!
I'm using the exact same dryer
the president just used!

954
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:28,074
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

955
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,578
No paper towels.
Take a hit off that,
my friend.

956
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:33,012
<i>Is that nice? Whoo!
Oh, yeah.</i>

957
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,016
<i>Take some of that,
my friend.</i>

958
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:37,780
If it's good enough
for the president,
it's good enough for me.

959
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:40,048
That's right!
Blowers are where it's at.

960
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:43,455
<i>Blowers are great. Towels suck.
That's right.</i>

961
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,824
Thank you, gentlemen.

962
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:52,166
Hey, get some money.
Get your money,
money, money.

963
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,259
ToJonathan.

964
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,769
<i>L'chayim.
L 'chayim.</i>

965
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,568
<i>- L 'chayim.
- Jonathan, I don't know
how you did it,</i>

966
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:02,873
but Williamson
came back to the office
begging to make a deal.

967
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:06,005
I would like to
thank you personally.

968
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,519
And this...

969
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,782
is the best way
that I know how.

970
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,790
<i>Milt.
Dad.</i>

971
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,849
Oh.

972
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:23,955
I can't take this.
Huh? What do you mean
you can't take it?

973
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:26,331
What, I'm gonna
live forever? Besides,

974
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:30,566
I was hoping that we might
keep it in the family.

975
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,732
Dad.

976
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:37,040
Believe me, no one has ever
given me anything like this
before in my life.

977
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,942
Thank you.

978
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:44,008
Thank you all.

979
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,452
Are you okay?
You're so quiet.

980
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:55,520
It's just I still can't believe
your dad gave me this.

981
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:59,364
It's just his way of
showing you how he feels
about you.

982
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,926
You know what 5/9/70 is.

983
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,802
Yeah. That's the day
Ernie took this one out.

984
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,866
It's also my dad's
license plate number,
his automatic teller code...

985
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:09,934
and the combination
to his safe.

986
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:13,641
That's the kind
of Ernie Banks nut
we're talking about here.

987
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:16,913
Whoa. This ball does
mean a lot to that guy.

988
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,284
Well, you mean a lot to him.

989
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,019
You mean a lot to me.

990
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:34,300
I can't believe
I am falling in love
with a Harvard man.

991
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,106
You're not.

992
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,470
Yes, I am.

993
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,455
She loves me.

994
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:00,654
She said that?

995
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:05,896
That's great.
We're in.

996
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,232
Well, I mean,
what if I get their money?

997
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,431
Hmm? Then what?
What do I do next?

998
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,498
Just go to another scam
and then another scam?
Yes.

999
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:15,476
God willing, yes!

1000
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:19,571
Maybe I could stay.
I mean, I have a real job.

1001
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:22,173
<i>Oh, shit.
Huh?</i>

1002
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,913
I think I could become
the guy they think I am.

1003
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,854
<i>Oh, shit.
Hey, they see
something in me.</i>

1004
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:31,859
Eddie, you conned them.
That's all. You're a con man.

1005
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,918
And now you're
conning yourself.

1006
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,625
Then it's the best one
I've ever pulled,
because it's working on me too.

1007
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,464
Love in a love con?

1008
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,800
What is this, amateur night?

1009
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:47,975
<i>I've gotta tell
Annie the truth.
Great.</i>

1010
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:50,739
Do it fast.

1011
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,906
Nice picture
of the Taj Mahal, huh?

1012
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,713
Jonathan,
David's coming back.

1013
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:59,720
Marlena,

1014
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:02,621
have Murphy and Davis
gotten their vaccinations yet?

1015
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:04,625
Annie.
No...

1016
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:08,356
Jonathan, hi.
Hi, hi. Uh, I have to talk
to you. It's real important.

1017
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,955
It's flu shot day.
I'm way behind. Can it wait?

1018
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:13,001
No. No, it can't wait.
Okay.

1019
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,536
<i>I love you!
Ew!</i>

1020
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,232
I love you.

1021
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:21,640
I'm happier than I've
ever been in my life.
Oh, me too, Jonathan.

1022
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,578
There's more.
Okay. I'm all ears.

1023
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:29,140
This... This is very scary
to say to someone.

1024
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,379
Uh,

1025
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,478
it's about us, I hope.

1026
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:35,489
Y-Yeah. But...

1027
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:40,017
Something about
our future maybe?
Well, yes, but it's...

1028
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:42,529
Oh, Jonathan, you coward.

1029
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,226
What?
The answer is yes.

1030
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,600
- "Yes"?
- Yes, I will marry you.

1031
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,839
Annie, you don't understand.
I am a phony.

1032
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:57,106
Jonathan,
I know you're a phony.

1033
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,704
Of course I do.
That's why I love you.

1034
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:03,775
Because underneath all of
your degrees and all of
your money is a real person.

1035
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:06,719
Oh, I've got kids
who need flu shots.

1036
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:09,782
Bye.
Wait. Th-There's more.

1037
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:13,259
Tell me later.
I love you.

1038
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:24,829
Married.

1039
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,484
Lou.

1040
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,890
You're not gonna believe this.
I'm gettin' married.

1041
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,267
<i>Eddie!</i>

1042
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,469
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1043
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,374
Congratulations, Eddie.
We're all very happy for you.

1044
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:04,378
Aren't we, guys?

1045
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:07,711
Your partner here was fencing
some very lovely merchandise
in the neighborhood,

1046
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:10,251
so I thought we'd all
drop by to say hi.

1047
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,615
Sal, I don't mind you
dropping by.

1048
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:16,624
I just wish you would
call first.

1049
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:20,150
Where's my money?

1050
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:24,666
We dumped the car, Sal.
We didn't take your money.

1051
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:29,329
Then let's say
I didn't kill you either,
and we'll call it even.

1052
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,897
<i>I'll get you your money.
I'm no good to you dead.</i>

1053
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:36,069
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1054
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:39,478
I know a way to get
$180,000 by tomorrow.
I swear it.

1055
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:42,016
I'm supposed to buy this
from a punk who never had...

1056
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,348
two 20s to rub together
in his whole lousy life?

1057
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,287
Look at this place, man. Huh?

1058
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:51,554
Look around.
I'm in the middle of
a major situation here.

1059
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,221
It costs you nothing to wait.

1060
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:58,297
It costs you $180,000
to kill me right now.

1061
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:10,071
Get the car.

1062
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,170
I'll tell you what.

1063
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,809
Mr. Pasquino here
will be the collateral
in our little agreement.

1064
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,080
No, no. You... No.
Yeah. He'll be alive until,

1065
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:21,554
let's say,
4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

1066
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,319
Okay?

1067
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:27,589
- Hey. Ow.
- Good.

1068
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,756
Lay off me!

1069
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:33,859
I hope this doesn't put a crimp
in your wedding plans.

1070
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:26,014
Frankly, I'm impressed.
This is a great deal
of money for a street punk.

1071
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,061
Lou, you feel okay?
Yeah.

1072
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,428
I feel like Elvis
back from the dead.

1073
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:40,400
Now, go on.
Get out of here.

1074
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:45,664
Go throw yourself
in front of a car or somethin'.

1075
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:51,269
<i>Hey, Sal.</i>

1076
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:54,338
<i>How'd you like to make
a lot more money?
What?</i>

1077
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,350
Four times that.

1078
01:15:56,418 --> 01:16:01,754
How could I possibly believe
some lowlife like you could
come up with that kind of cash?

1079
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:07,423
I believe I just gave you
180,000 reasons.

1080
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,003
You are gonna
get us killed.
We're not gonna get killed.

1081
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:20,098
We're gonna get rich. I don't
know how we're gonna do it yet,
but we're gonna sting Sal,

1082
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:22,109
then we're gonna retire
to Florida.

1083
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:24,168
I thought you were
gonna marry that girl.

1084
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:28,649
No, no, no.
What, are you kidding?
Lou, the whole thing was a con.

1085
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:33,620
What was I thinking,
I could step into a new life
like a new pair of pants?

1086
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,518
But, you know,
you and that broad...

1087
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,788
made a real cute couple.

1088
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,159
Get in.

1089
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,337
I'm impressed.
Nearly a million of our
dryers hang in schools,

1090
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,402
public libraries,
police precincts.

1091
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,875
Yep. Even his mayor's
private bathroom.

1092
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:06,819
So, what's your point?
Relax.

1093
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,879
You look a little
stressed out.

1094
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:13,789
My point is is that
we're both businessmen.

1095
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,057
<i>Hey. Come on.
Hey, I'm a businessman.</i>

1096
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,065
You're a fuckin' con man.

1097
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,431
Of course I'm a con man.

1098
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:24,268
I conned my way into this.
I'm just offering you
a piece of the action.

1099
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:26,739
What action?

1100
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:31,040
- Gerald Fox.
- The building commissioner?

1101
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:35,607
You see, Gerry's looking for
the right wrecking company
for a city demolition job.

1102
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:38,244
Pays 900 grand.

1103
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,618
<i>But you have to put up
a cash bond.</i>

1104
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,487
175,000.

1105
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,549
Nonrefundable.

1106
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,925
Kickback.

1107
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:53,232
We don't use that kind of
terminology with Mr. Fox.

1108
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:56,395
Why me? There's a lot of
wrecking companies.

1109
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,304
<i>Because not everyone's
comfortable with
this kind ofbusiness.</i>

1110
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:01,774
But you're comfortable.
Aren't you, Sal?

1111
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,875
<i>Yeah, I'm comfortable.
Excellent.</i>

1112
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,939
I'll call the commissioner.

1113
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,512
Bullshit.

1114
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,921
This whole setup is bullshit.

1115
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:23,120
Okay. Let's go.

1116
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,292
- What do mean, "Go"?
Go where?
- City hall.

1117
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:39,105
<i>Exterminator.</i>

1118
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:43,515
Exterminator?
We didn't call an exterminator.
You didn't ca...

1119
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:46,110
This is the building
commissioner's office,
isn't it?

1120
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,520
<i>We didn't call for
the exterminator.</i>

1121
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,785
<i>Oh, great.
Now, if you don't mind.</i>

1122
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,020
That's great.

1123
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,700
Maybe he did.

1124
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,661
Oh, my God!

1125
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:08,471
<i>Have a nice day.
Commissioner!</i>

1126
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:20,416
<i>Yes. Now, you know
the commissioner's all tied up,</i>

1127
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:24,425
<i>but maybe I can squeeze you in
next month, okay?</i>

1128
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:27,326
Oh. Please hold.

1129
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:32,329
Why, Mr. Albertson,
what a pleasant surprise.

1130
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,301
Look, I know we don't have
an appointment, but, uh,

1131
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,134
do you think Gerry might be
able to slip us in?

1132
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,868
Let's just see, shall we?

1133
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:46,410
<i>Well, what about
the end ofJuly? Yeah.</i>

1134
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:49,814
Jon! Jon Albertson,
get on in here.

1135
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:51,876
Uh, yeah, Senator,
I say 20 million...

1136
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,013
Let's not take
too much of his time.
He's a very busy man.

1137
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:59,925
Well, I hope the governor
sees it our way.
Yeah. All right. Right. Bye.

1138
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,190
Jon!
Gerry.

1139
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:05,165
How are Betty
and those kids, huh?
Oh, fine. Just fine.

1140
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:09,761
Great.
Gentlemen, why don't we have
our little conversation outside.

1141
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,329
Yeah. Outside.

1142
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,715
My office is not gonna pay
for this exterminator.

1143
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:25,412
Well, I can't help it.
I'm never coming in here again.
Oh.

1144
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,751
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1145
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:32,351
Now, we need a cash bond
from you, Mr. Nichols,

1146
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:36,022
for, uh, $250,000.

1147
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,930
Two hundred and fifty grand?
That's 75 more
than I thought.

1148
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,991
If you've got a problem
with the numbers,

1149
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,197
there are contractors
in this city who'd swim
Lake Michigan...

1150
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:47,173
for a $1.3 million job.
One point three?

1151
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:50,006
Uh-huh.
One point three?

1152
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,404
No, no, no.
Those numbers are fine.

1153
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,472
Fine.

1154
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:59,316
You know what?
I had a feeling that
you two would hit it off.

1155
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,981
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.</i>

1156
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,591
Oh, yes.
This'll fool anybody.

1157
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,151
Hey, hey, hey, hey, boyo.

1158
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:12,428
You gotta knock that off.
You still have to play
that city official tonight.

1159
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,936
That's why I need another one.
I haven't done this in 20 years.

1160
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,905
<i>Uncle Max, Sal Nichols
may have a problem with
handing over...</i>

1161
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,738
a quarter million dollars
to a damn leprechaun.

1162
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:25,075
Listen, don't worry about me.
I'll be sober
in a couple of hours.

1163
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:28,707
- You'll still be stupid.
- Hey, I know what I'm
supposed to be doing.

1164
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:31,343
Now, we meet 9:30
at the building site,

1165
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:34,411
then bida-bing-bang-boom,
and 11:00 at the airport.

1166
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:37,424
- Connie, have you got
the tickets?
- First class, kiddo.

1167
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:39,892
<i>All right.
We're out ofhere.</i>

1168
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,966
- Whoever that is,
get rid of'em.
- Okay. I'll take care of it.

1169
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:49,435
<i>Let's go, let's go</i>

1170
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:54,100
<i>Oh, Milt, Mona, Annie,
what a wonderful surprise.</i>

1171
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:56,837
<i>- Well, we've got
a big surprise for you.
- Hi.</i>

1172
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,846
Don't we, Milt?
We sure do.

1173
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,939
Yes indeed.
Jonathan, you have company?

1174
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,644
<i>- Company?
- Yeah.</i>

1175
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:07,711
Oh. Uh, yeah,
I have company.
Uh, my... my parents.

1176
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:09,654
<i>Your parents?
Those are my parents.</i>

1177
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,692
They just got here.

1178
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,389
<i>Milt, Mona, Annie,
I would like you to meet
Thorton...</i>

1179
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:18,660
<i>and Cornelia.
Oh.</i>

1180
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,860
They flew in when
they heard the good news.

1181
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,870
<i>That is just wonderful.</i>

1182
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:27,466
<i>Thorton and Cornelia,
Jonathan has told me
so much about you.</i>

1183
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,635
I feel like
I know you so well.

1184
01:22:29,711 --> 01:22:32,441
Well, we feel as though
we've known you
all our lives.

1185
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,539
Aw.
Don't we, Cornelia?

1186
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,641
We certainly do,
Thorton. Yes.

1187
01:22:36,718 --> 01:22:39,346
Oh, how wonderful
to meet you.

1188
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:46,083
How you doing?
David Malkin.

1189
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:48,095
Okay, great.
Where are we at?

1190
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:52,259
Spot the red queen and make her
yours. Where's the little lady?
Five will get you 10.

1191
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,928
I can't believe it.
I cannot believe...
What?

1192
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,971
that you don't
tease your hair.
No.

1193
01:22:57,038 --> 01:23:00,007
You mean that is
all in the cut?
Absolutely.

1194
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:03,704
Oh, Mona. Listen, would you
let me feel that?
Oh, of course.

1195
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:06,212
Oh, look at that.
Well, you know,

1196
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:09,079
<i>Alfred is just
a genius with...</i>

1197
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,744
<i>Oh, Cornelia,
you are so kind.</i>

1198
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:16,455
Hey. I love your parents.
What?

1199
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:18,685
Your parents.
I think they're great.

1200
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,957
Yeah. Well, I hope this isn't
too rowdy for them.

1201
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,021
They're a little
conservative actually.

1202
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:27,227
Oh, Mona,
look how it's short
and then it gets long.

1203
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,293
<i>Oh. Beautiful.
Where's the little lady?</i>

1204
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:32,863
Five will get you 10.
Is she with the jack?
Is she with the king?

1205
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:35,171
What do you say, Milt?
One ice-cold beer, Milt.

1206
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,177
What do you say, Milt?
Thorton.

1207
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,475
What?
Aren't you forgetting
something?

1208
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:43,813
Ooh, yeah.
You know, Milt, I brought
the family album along.

1209
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:46,615
<i>It's back at the hotel.
Maybe I should pop back...
Ah!</i>

1210
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,088
You don't have to
go now, do you?
Nonsense. Nonsense.

1211
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,752
You and the missus
will get a kick out of it.
And I'll drive you.

1212
01:23:52,827 --> 01:23:54,795
Jon, you want to
take a ride?

1213
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:57,593
Uh, yeah.
Not a chance.

1214
01:23:57,665 --> 01:24:00,225
I am not letting him
out of my sight.

1215
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:04,571
Jonathan, that might be
your surprise.

1216
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,336
Hello.
David, where are you?

1217
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,469
<i>Well, he...
he's right here.</i>

1218
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,013
Come on. Go.
Oh. My surprise. Great.

1219
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,072
Jonathan, it's David.
He wants to talk to you.

1220
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,175
Go.
Why don't you talk to him?

1221
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:19,686
Really.
Jonathan, take the phone.

1222
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,314
Thanks.

1223
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,324
David, how are you?

1224
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:27,589
Jonathan? This doesn't
sound like you.

1225
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:31,621
Uh, great to, uh, hear
your voice again too,
old man.

1226
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,670
<i>Really? Listen,
I beg to differ
on that point, my friend.</i>

1227
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:41,141
<i>I think that Calcutta couldn't
have been as hot as it's been
around here, mon ami.</i>

1228
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:43,803
Is this some kind of joke?
Who is this?

1229
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:48,144
Well, you're right about that.
l... I am a lucky guy.

1230
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,548
<i>Annie's one in a million.</i>

1231
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:54,452
You jerk. I am gonna
come out there and
kick the shit out of you.

1232
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:57,423
Great. Great.
I'll be looking forward to it.

1233
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,585
I bet you're very good at that.

1234
01:24:59,661 --> 01:25:01,652
Put my dad on the line.
What?

1235
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,562
Can you believe it?
The car didn't meet him
at the airport.

1236
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:07,999
<i>Listen, can you stay put
for 45 minutes,
and I'll be right there?</i>

1237
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:11,630
Good idea, Jonathan.
Oh, yes.
What a sweet thing to do.

1238
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:13,970
Okay. All right.
I'll see you.

1239
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:26,076
Give me that.
Wait. Wait.

1240
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:29,920
I think you've had enough.
Don't spill it!
Don't...

1241
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:31,982
All right. Go.

1242
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:53,937
Look at that baby!

1243
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,118
You know, the governor
opposed this site.

1244
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,249
Mayor was dead set
against it.

1245
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,351
But when I get my mind set...
That's right.
That's right.

1246
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:11,296
Rammed this baby right through
city council. That's the kind
of building commissioner he is.

1247
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:14,335
I'm sure we can do
more business together
in the future.

1248
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:16,393
I think we might be
laying the foundation...

1249
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:20,703
for a long and mutually
beneficial relationship,
Mr. Nichols.

1250
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:24,711
Now, I need your signature
in triplicate.

1251
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:26,770
City contracts.

1252
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,816
1.3 million.

1253
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:31,852
Your signature here,
here and here.

1254
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:37,083
<i>Completion guarantee.
Signature here.
Okay.</i>

1255
01:26:37,158 --> 01:26:39,854
Hey, you got enough
hard hats to go around?

1256
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:42,123
Oh, he's great.

1257
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:45,758
Commissioner, uh,
shouldn't you explain
the time pressure?

1258
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:48,097
Time pressure?
Didn't you want them
to start...

1259
01:26:48,169 --> 01:26:50,967
tomorrow before
the weekend is over?

1260
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,303
Damn straight.
Yeah.

1261
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:56,275
The medical center's due
to start construction here
next week.

1262
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:59,074
I need the site cleared
before the weekend is over.

1263
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:01,081
The weekend?
Nobody works on the weekend.

1264
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,241
I've just wasted my time.
Forget it.

1265
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,253
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1266
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:09,790
The weekend'll be
just fine.

1267
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:15,893
<i>Now, here's your copy.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.</i>

1268
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:18,057
Oh, yeah.

1269
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,226
There we are.

1270
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:27,408
Oh, uh, Mr. Nichols,
one more thing.

1271
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:31,009
Which way do you think
this baby's gonna fall?

1272
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:36,072
Down.

1273
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:38,812
I'm sure Mr. Nichols
knows what he's doing.

1274
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,184
Good luck! Timber!

1275
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,247
"Down."

1276
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:49,756
We did it.

1277
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,796
What's keeping everybody?

1278
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:02,934
Where the heck is that hotel,
the other side of the moon?

1279
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:05,605
It must be.

1280
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,444
I don't know where
they're staying.

1281
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:10,984
I'll ask Cornelia.
Cornelia.

1282
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,015
Cornelia?

1283
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:20,459
<i>Whoo-oo.
Connie, you should
have seen us.</i>

1284
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:23,827
It was just like
old times.
Oh. Oh.

1285
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:27,095
Keep your motor running.
We'll be right with you.

1286
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:29,568
Eddie, are you okay?

1287
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:32,772
Yeah, I guess so.

1288
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:37,036
<i>Well, you handled that
like a pro.</i>

1289
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:40,205
<i>Now that you've got
the basics down,</i>

1290
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,772
I cannot wait
till you get to Miami.

1291
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,785
Those clubs are crawling
with rich widows.

1292
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:48,617
No, no.
I don't think I'm cut out
for the love con.

1293
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:52,786
Oh, just give it
a little time, kid.
It'll work out fine.

1294
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:57,661
I don't know. There's...
There's somethin' missing.

1295
01:28:57,732 --> 01:29:01,498
What's missing?
Look, you got the money.

1296
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,537
You got Miami.

1297
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,595
You got me.

1298
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:11,705
I'm telling you,
the flight's already arrived.

1299
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:14,373
Page him again, please.
Why don't you let me
talk to...

1300
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:17,179
They're going to page him.
Jonathan!

1301
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:19,879
Oh!
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

1302
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:23,890
- Where's David?
- Wait. There's something
I have to say.

1303
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:26,825
Where's David?
What is it?

1304
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:29,488
You've been like
parents to me.

1305
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:33,000
Aw.
You're like
our own son.

1306
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:35,058
We love you.

1307
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:44,409
This is your money.
I took it out of the safe.

1308
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,108
How did you do that?
Why?

1309
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:51,242
That's not all.

1310
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:53,685
Jonathan,

1311
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:55,848
whatever this is,
we can work it out.

1312
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,955
<i>I don't think we can ever
work this out.</i>

1313
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,962
Jonathan, what is it?
What's wrong?

1314
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:06,124
I'm notJonathan Albertson.

1315
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,327
NotJonathan?
You're not
Jonathan Albertson?

1316
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:11,998
My name is Eddie Farrel,
and I'm a con man.

1317
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,906
This whole thing
is a con.

1318
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:24,479
Annie,
I used you to get to
your father's money.

1319
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:27,687
Oh, my God.

1320
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:30,315
But I fell in love with you.

1321
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:32,382
Oh, Annie, honey.

1322
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,428
Annie, I'm s...
I don't believe you.

1323
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:36,486
Annie, I'm sorry.
I think you've done enough!

1324
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,191
Milt, please?

1325
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:46,963
Annie, I'm so sorry
I hurt you.

1326
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,335
But I love you.

1327
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:55,246
<i>I really do love you.</i>

1328
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:44,387
Hey.
You must be David.

1329
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:52,295
David,
Yeah.

1330
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:57,002
you've got
a great family.

1331
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:00,872
I'm sorry.

1332
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:21,831
<i>Police are investigating
the bizarre destruction...</i>

1333

of the I RS building
in downtown Chicago.

1334
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:28,667
Mr. Nichols, who has had
previous problems
with the I RS,

1335
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:33,703
now faces 247 years

1339
01:32:41,722 --> 01:32:45,021
<i>We'll be bringing you updates...</i>

1340
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:15,021
Hmm.

1341
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:37,039
<i>Annie, this is Eddie.</i>

1342
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:39,045
<i>Jonathan. Eddie. Whatever.</i>

1343
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,172
<i>Will you pick up
the phone, please?</i>

1344
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:47,014
<i>How many times do I have
to call? You're listening to me
right now, aren't you?</i>

1345
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:49,515
I was in
the neighborhood, and...

1346
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:52,279
I've got
some extra blood.

1347
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:55,588
Please leave.

1348
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:00,150
I love you.

1349
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:11,001
If you can turn around and
tell me that you don't love me,

1350
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:13,165
I'll walk
right out of here.

1351
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,071
I don't love you.

1352
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:37,058
<i>I'll bet you're glad
to be rid of that guy.</i>

1353
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:43,232
<i>That's right.
He really was a nuisance.</i>

1354
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:45,568
<i>Coming around,
bringing you flowers,</i>

1355
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:47,573
<i>making us laugh,</i>

1356
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:49,666
<i>dragging you
out on dates.</i>

1357
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,640
Yeah, he won't be
cutting into no more
of your busy schedule.

1358
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:00,378
Damn you, Harold.

1359
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,893
Eddie Farrel!

1360
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:11,496
How dare you
do that to me!

1361
01:36:11,565 --> 01:36:14,762
Annie, I love you.

1362
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:17,633
<i>If you don't believe me,
there's nothing I can do.</i>

1363
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:20,401
<i>No!</i>

1364
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:23,272
No! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1365
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:27,607
Eddie. Eddie, are you okay?
Annie?

1366
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:31,242
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Are you okay?
Ow.

1367
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:33,582
Eddie, I love you.
I do. I love you.

1368
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:36,923
That's all
I wanted to hear.

1369
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:40,059
What?

1370
01:36:47,802 --> 01:36:50,270
Love in a love con.

1371
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:53,636
I hate to see it.
It's like I said,
Max,

1372
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:55,766
amateur night.

1373
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:08,414
<i>It's a cruel, crazy
beautiful world</i>

1374

<i>It's your world
so live in it</i>

1379
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:45,816
<i>You got to wash
with the crocodile
in the river</i>

1380
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:49,954
<i>You got to swim
with the sharks in the sea</i>

1381
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,989
<i>You got to live
with the crooked politician</i>

1382

<i>Trust those things

1383

<i>Keep on believing tomorrow

1385

<i>Sometimes you smile while
you're crying inside</i>

1386
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:22,017
