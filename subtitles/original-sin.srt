00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:24,349
"You cannot walk away from love."

3
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,728
That was the advertisement
in a Baltimore newspaper.

4
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,607
And that is how he found her.

5
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:37,612
She was a young woman
in need of a husband.

6
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,907
And he was a man who wanted a wife.

7
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:02,887
Too late to talk sense to him now.

8
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:05,265
You can't marry her, Luis.
You've never met her.

9
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:09,352
I meet her today. The boat from America
comes at 6:00, we marry at 9:00...

10
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,021
...by 10:00, I'm back at work.

11
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:13,898
Ridiculous. This is ridiculous.

12
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:18,486
A man needs a wife, isn't that what
you've been telling me? Well... I sent for one.

13
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,571
From America.

14
00:02:19,654 --> 00:02:21,197
What does she look like?

15
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:25,994
Comes a day in every man's life
when a band is playing...

16
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:30,540
...and he's the only one who can hear it.
Today is your day.

17
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,667
I love you, woman.

18
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:34,919
She is not beautiful.

19
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:37,339
She is not meant to be beautiful...

20
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:40,675
...just kind, true and young enough
to bear children.

21
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:46,640
Go on. The sun will be up any minute.
The boat will be coming in.

22
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:52,812
But what about love, Luis?
Doesn't love come into this at all?

23
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:55,357
Love is not for me, Alan.

24
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,776
Love is for those people who believe in it.

25
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:00,320
Let's go.

26
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:04,908
Why are you laughing at me?
You've been laughing at me all morning.

27
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,494
Never mind. You go! Go on!

28
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,866
No, this is not a love story.

29
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:33,204
Butitis a story aboutlove,
and the powerit has over ourlife.

30
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:36,958
The power to heal or destroy.

31
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,720
and this is where the story begins.

32
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:06,196
Mr. Vargas?

33
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,991
Luis Vargas?

34
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,662
You don't recognize me, do you?

35
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,084
Miss Russell?

36
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:21,503
Yes.

37
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,341
Julia Russell?

38
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,178
But this, this picture--

39
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,307
I've deceived you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

40
00:05:35,183 --> 00:05:37,727
I was unsure. You see...

41
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:42,148
...l didn't want you interested in me
just because I owned a pretty face.

42
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:47,529
So I sent another woman's photograph
and not my own.

43
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:52,033
I see.

44
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:55,954
I hope you forgive me.
I meant to write many times. I tried.

45
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:58,665
But my courage failed me. So l....

46
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:06,798
And....

47
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:14,639
Now I stand before you as I am,
and you know the worst.

48
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:16,141
No, no.

49
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:18,810
Not the worst at all.

50
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,648
Only, not what I was expecting.

51
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:27,819
If my deception has altered
your intentions...

52
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:29,654
...if you're not satisfied--

53
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:30,989
No, it isn't that.

54
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:34,326
...l am determined to make my way back
to my home in Delaware.

55
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:36,745
-If you say so, I will.
-Miss Russell....

56
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:39,831
Miss Russell...

57
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,295
...you have been honest with me.

58
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:48,298
I will be honest with you, too.

59
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,719
I will admit to a deception of my own.

60
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,683
You are exactly the image
of your photograph.

61
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,435
Yes, I am.

62
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:03,938
But I wrote to you that I am a clerk...

63
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,983
...in a coffee export house. I am not.

64
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,655
I own the house.

65
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,115
The business is my own.

66
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:21,998
You did not want me
to be interested in you...

67
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:24,834
...just because you owned
a pretty bank account.

68
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,379
Yes.

69
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,218
Then we have something in common.

70
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:36,805
We are both not to be trusted.

71
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:46,064
Of course, if my deception
has altered your intentions...

72
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:52,362
...if you are not interested
in marrying a wealthy man....

73
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,573
No, I think I could manage.

74
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:00,996
If you could manage
a somewhat prettier wife.

75
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,458
I'll make the effort.

76
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:22,100
Miss Russell.

77
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:25,353
Mr. Vargas.

78
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:30,066
Now we have all the time in the world
to get to know each other.

79
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,861
Well... No, not all the time.

80
00:08:35,196 --> 00:08:37,574
No, we are going to be married at 9:00.

81
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:41,828
Well then, we'd better hurry.

82
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:55,175
"Take this ring...

83
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,886
"...as a sign of my love...

84
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,389
"...and fidelity...

85
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:03,141
"...to you."

86
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,000
Music!

87
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,377
Music!

88
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,013
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

89
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:46,142
To our groom and his beautiful...

90
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:48,853
...enchanting bride!

91
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,610
Will you dance with me?

92
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:57,237
Dance?

93
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:00,740
I don't dance.

94
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:03,076
I say you do.

95
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:12,210
May their life together be like this dance,
harmonious, smooth.

96
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:15,255
Dance for life never ending and--

97
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:17,215
Alan, enough is enough.

98
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,591
I'm almost through.

99
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:21,469
You're through now. Sit down.

100
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:13,480
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you.

101
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:47,597
Would you like to see the house?

102
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:50,517
Oh, no. I can see it tomorrow.

103
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:57,440
You must give me a few moments.
I'm shy of these things.

104
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:03,196
I will give you as many moments,
days, nights as you need.

105
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:07,492
When you want me to come to you...

106
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:09,661
...l will.

107
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,205
Not before.

108
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:19,087
You would do that for me?

109
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,757
If you say so, yes.

110
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,224
Then...

111
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:33,768
...l will say good night.

112
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,984
The room is there, to the right.

113
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:43,945
I think I'll find it.

114
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,812
Awake at last.

115
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,524
The day is half-gone.

116
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:07,195
I'm sorry. I'm not dressed.

117
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,073
I could wait outside,
but the coffee would get cold.

118
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:11,825
No, it's all right.

119
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:15,829
If someone brought me my coffee
every morning before I dressed...

120
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,956
...l would be very happy.

121
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,041
It would change the day.

122
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,251
But...

123
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,920
...you only drink tea.

124
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,630
I do? No.

125
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:30,260
When I wrote I worked in a coffee
company, you wrote back--

126
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,970
That was my sister.

127
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:37,309
She believed coffee to be a sinful
pleasure so I pretended to agree.

128
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:41,604
She read all my letters to you,
so I could not always be truthful.

129
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:49,362
All the more reason to forget them.
That's all behind you.

130
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:53,199
What do you think?

131
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:56,369
About what?

132
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:01,708
Do you believe as my sister does...

133
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,754
...that pleasure could ever be sinful?

134
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:06,648
Why did you choose an American wife?

135
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:11,027
Here, we are the past.

136
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:14,447
There, you are the future.

137
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,995
Why did you choose to leave it?

138
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,164
To escape the future.

139
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,502
To become someone else, I think.

140
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:33,508
I am someone else with you.

141
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:37,554
Someone more like...

142
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,723
...myself.

143
00:16:57,991 --> 00:17:00,160
There, in his arms...

144
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:02,620
...she became someone else.

145
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:06,374
Someone more like herself.

146
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:22,722
I'm telling you, I've never been happier.

147
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:25,891
There's no such thing as happily married.

148
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:28,811
It's an oxymoron, like "happily dead".

149
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:33,983
I thought you'd be finding your way
back to the whores by now.

150
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,901
Seeing a little "Creole" time.

151
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:37,069
Not anymore.

152
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:39,530
You've had her for yourself long enough.

153
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,449
When do we get to see her again?

154
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:43,451
We're going to the theatre next week.

155
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:45,703
An American touring company
she wants to see.

156
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:47,038
Why don't you join us?

157
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,883
Soon comes the morning
when the knell is rung...

158
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:01,427
...to take my living breath.

159
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,763
Come, come, the night is almost done.

160
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:10,061
Satan is near!

161
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,855
The shrieking, grim and...

162
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:16,192
...hideous brim of hell to uncover.

163
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,236
Come, or you will share her wretched end.

164
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,239
Hellhound! Abominable monster!

165
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,742
Would that I had never been born!

166
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,248
Wonderful. Wonderful.

167
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:32,917
Disgusting.

168
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:35,086
Cheap melodrama.

169
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:41,342
Was it we who forced our way to you?
Who was it sent her to her ruin?

170
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:43,010
I...

171
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:45,596
...or you?

172
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,934
What evil thing has risen from the ground?

173
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:54,438
Father, let angels now have charge of me...

174
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:57,525
...encamped around heavenly company.

175
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,694
She is condemned to die.

176
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:03,698
She is redeemed on high!

177
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:05,783
Hither, to me!

178
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:20,131
Julia, my dear, you look flushed.

179
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:23,718
-Are you all right?
-Yes, it's the theatre.

180
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,344
I love it...

181
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:27,304
...even the cheap melodrama.

182
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:31,308
Will you excuse me?

183
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,900
Does she suffer from fevers?

184
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:43,154
She suffers from a little too much rouge.

185
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:46,907
Nonsense. A lady does not wear rouge.

186
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,909
No, a lady doesn't.

187
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:52,913
And a lady does not wander through
the theater alone, either.

188
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:56,250
Excuse me.

189
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:04,008
Perhaps you will find the second act
more appealing.

190
00:22:57,937 --> 00:23:00,940
Excuse me, sir!
The public is not allowed backstage.

191
00:23:01,023 --> 00:23:02,983
Don't touch me, sir.

192
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,985
That is my wife, damn it!

193
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:07,238
Luis, you've come to my rescue...

194
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,490
...just like a play....

195
00:23:11,492 --> 00:23:13,327
What are you doing here?

196
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:17,456
Isn't it exciting?
Look at all these mysterious contraptions.

197
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:21,377
-Who was that man?
-What man? I was lost, that's all.

198
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,587
You made my heart stop.

199
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:26,716
Feel my heart. Feel how fast it's beating?

200
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,680
Christ.

201
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,224
You'll be the death of me.

202
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,521
I hope so.

203
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,693
Places, please.

204
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,320
Ladies and gentlemen, places for act two.

205
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:58,205
Take me home now.

206
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:11,052
My own dearest sister.

207
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:16,432
I can't understand why you treat me thus.
Itis many weeks now since you left.

208
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:21,145
In all that time, no word from you
to tell me of your safe arrival...

209
00:24:21,354 --> 00:24:25,358
...whetheryou met Mr. Vargas,
whether the marriage has taken place.

210
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:27,443
What am I to think?

211
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:30,696
I have contacted the embassy in Havana...

212
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:33,282
...and the authorities there in Santiago.

213
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:36,160
I know how you feel about her, but...

214
00:24:36,786 --> 00:24:38,162
...you have to write.

215
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:43,334
You have to,
before she has the police on us.

216
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:46,045
You're right. I've been unkind to her.

217
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:49,674
Although she has never been kind to me.

218
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:53,636
Just do it.

219
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:57,431
Do it, and then it's done.

220
00:24:57,515 --> 00:24:59,475
No, no, no!

221
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:05,147
It's all right. It's me, Luis.

222
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:07,692
You were dreaming.

223
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:10,986
Are you all right?

224
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:17,660
That's it.

225
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:20,663
You were just dreaming.

226
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:24,834
It's all right.

227
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:28,462
It was just a dream.

228
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:32,091
A bad one, that's all.

229
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:41,642
It was just a dream.

230
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:44,228
You okay? You need something?

231
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,271
You.

232
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:47,440
I'm sorry.

233
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:49,942
You are here with me. Secure.

234
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:51,986
You're all right.

235
00:25:52,445 --> 00:25:53,946
Will you stay?

236
00:25:54,113 --> 00:25:55,448
Of course.

237
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:57,992
Of course.

238
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:01,454
It's all right.

239
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:35,071
Luis, don't go.

240
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:40,076
How is the queen of the house
this morning?

241
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,500
Look. See? I've done it.

242
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:52,004
This is for the best. Thank you.

243
00:26:52,254 --> 00:26:56,050
-I'll have Sara post it this morning.
-No need. I can do it myself.

244
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:58,135
I haven't addressed it.

245
00:26:58,219 --> 00:27:02,181
I have the address at the office.
Then it's on its way.

246
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:12,692
What will you do today?

247
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:16,112
I'm going to an English dressmaker
at the Plaza Vieja.

248
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:20,366
You'll need money.

249
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,829
Sign here, Señora.

250
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:29,750
Is this for both your personal
and business account?

251
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,377
Yes, thank you.

252
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:34,755
I want my wife to have free use
of all my accounts.

253
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:36,215
There you are.

254
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:38,551
Should I sign using my Christian name?

255
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,469
No, your married name.

256
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:44,181
You must remember to repeat
the signature exactly...

257
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:46,350
...each time you draw a check.

258
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:48,394
I will try.

259
00:27:59,238 --> 00:28:00,906
Oh, man!

260
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:12,251
So, Luis, is it love after all...

261
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:14,462
...or is it just lust?

262
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:16,922
Is there a difference?

263
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:18,424
Oh, yes.

264
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:22,261
To love someone is to give
and then want to give more.

265
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:24,430
And lust?

266
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:26,182
What is lust, Alan?

267
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:30,144
Lust is to take and then take more.

268
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:33,272
To devour, to consume.
No logic, no reason.

269
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:36,484
So...give, take.

270
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:38,652
Which is it?

271
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:40,446
Both.

272
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:45,409
I want to give her everything.

273
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:49,288
And I want to take everything from her.

274
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:53,793
Oh, Luis. You are a lost man.

275
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:55,670
No, no.

276
00:28:57,713 --> 00:28:59,965
She is the one who seems to be lost.

277
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:04,220
How, why, I don't know.
But that will change.

278
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:07,306
I can change that.

279
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:15,272
Mr. Vargas?

280
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:19,985
Walter Downs.
I didn't mean to startle you.

281
00:29:20,277 --> 00:29:22,905
-That's okay.
-I was told I could find you upstairs.

282
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:24,490
-How can I help?
-Small matter.

283
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:27,493
Hardly worth your trouble.
I've been engaged by Miss Russell.

284
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:28,703
You mean, Julia?

285
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,372
No, Emily. Julia's sister.

286
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:32,748
In Delaware.

287
00:29:32,832 --> 00:29:34,709
I'm a private investigator.

288
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:37,003
Just recently arrived from Wilmington.

289
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:42,091
I understand.
I know Miss Russell was distressed.

290
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:45,136
But we've written to her several weeks ago.

291
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:50,057
I'm sure when she receives the letter,
she will be much relieved.

292
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:52,143
Then Miss Julia is all right?

293
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:55,646
More than all right.
And more than Miss Julia.

294
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:57,732
She's Señora Vargas, my wife.

295
00:29:57,815 --> 00:29:59,316
So you are married?

296
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:04,196
-That's very good news.
-Happily married.

297
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,823
Yes, I can see that.

298
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:09,076
What a mystery a happy marriage is.

299
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:12,121
The bloom in the cheek,
the spark in the eye.

300
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:15,374
-It shows, I guess.
-Yes, indeed.

301
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:17,626
Miss Russell will be pleased to hear of it.

302
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:20,212
I'd appreciate if you'd tell her.

303
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:21,547
I will, indeed.

304
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:26,927
And I'll be even more convincing
when I've met your wife.

305
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:31,557
Yes, yes.

306
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:33,392
Why not?

307
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,606
We will be home Sunday afternoon.

308
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:41,192
You want to come by for a coffee?

309
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:42,568
Yes, I will.

310
00:30:42,651 --> 00:30:46,030
And... please convey to your wife
how much I look forward to seeing her.

311
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,960
Outside, please. On the terrace.

312
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:02,546
Do as she says.

313
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,843
Oh! Just in time.

314
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:11,847
This is for Sunday paseo,
and this one for weekdays.

315
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:14,433
Fine, fine.

316
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:17,186
And the rest?

317
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:19,271
This one I like.

318
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:22,942
What do you mean?
There are seven days in a week.

319
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:26,070
What about your trunk? Is there nothing in there?

320
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:29,907
Nothing good. Anyway, I've lost the key.

321
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:33,577
We'll get a locksmith.
It's an easy job. Actually...

322
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,705
...l'll do it myself.

323
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:39,959
No, I want to show you something. Come here.

324
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:43,921
You must leave now.
I'm going to kiss my husband.

325
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,507
Then we're going to take a bath.

326
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:05,234
What do I smell?

327
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:07,319
My perfume.

328
00:32:07,653 --> 00:32:08,779
No.

329
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:12,033
A cigar.

330
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,161
I tried one.

331
00:32:17,496 --> 00:32:18,956
One of my cigars?

332
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,126
I wanted the taste of you in my mouth.

333
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:27,965
You have no shame at all.

334
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:31,427
Well, there is no shame in loving each other.

335
00:32:32,136 --> 00:32:34,138
Do you love me? Julia?

336
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:36,474
Do you love me?

337
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,602
Or are you not the loving kind?

338
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:21,519
I forgot to tell you.

339
00:33:23,354 --> 00:33:25,856
We have a visitor coming on Sunday.

340
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:28,526
We do?

341
00:33:29,568 --> 00:33:30,820
Yes...

342
00:33:30,945 --> 00:33:33,114
...a genuine private investigator...

343
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,867
...all the way from Delaware.

344
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:40,830
So, Emily sent him.

345
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,874
Yeah. Detective Downs.

346
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:46,335
Detective Downs, did you say?

347
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:49,213
Don't worry,
he only needs to see that you're well...

348
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:52,591
...and happy and truly my wife.

349
00:33:53,718 --> 00:33:58,055
-Then this nonsense is over.
-When will that damn bird stop screaming?

350
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:01,350
Julia.

351
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:10,067
Careful, it's coming.

352
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:26,042
Oh, no.

353
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:33,841
Don Luis, look. He's dead.

354
00:34:35,176 --> 00:34:36,635
He was just singing.

355
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:39,096
He's not singing now, is he?

356
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,142
Looks like he got his little neck broken.

357
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:48,022
Take him away.
I don't want Julia to see him.

358
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:43,327
How does a person die on this instrument?

359
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:47,707
I believe that...

360
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,336
...the turning of the wheel
breaks one's neck.

361
00:35:53,504 --> 00:35:55,172
And if it doesn't?

362
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,092
Does one then strangle?

363
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:01,387
Are you afraid?

364
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:05,850
No.

365
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,561
Julia is not afraid.

366
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,023
But Bonny is.

367
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:17,737
I don't understand. Who is Bonny?

368
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,160
Who is Bonny?

369
00:36:26,837 --> 00:36:28,505
I'm looking for Mr. Vargas.

370
00:36:28,631 --> 00:36:30,924
That is a question
Luis would soon be asking.

371
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,265
Mr. Vargas?

372
00:36:39,224 --> 00:36:40,559
My name is Russell.

373
00:36:41,393 --> 00:36:42,811
Emily Russell.

374
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:44,938
I am Julia's sister.

375
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:51,362
So you understand how upset I was
to receive this letter.

376
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,988
Upset?

377
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,451
But... I... I thought you would be pleased
to receive it.

378
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:00,788
This letter, sir...

379
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:04,625
...which was written in answer to the one I last sent here...

380
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:07,294
...and which is signed in her name...

381
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:09,797
...is not from Julia.

382
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:14,009
Of course it is.

383
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:15,844
I mailed it myself.

384
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,013
This letter was not written by my sister.

385
00:37:18,055 --> 00:37:19,515
Miss Russell.

386
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:27,314
I'm sorry.

387
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:30,359
Don't be upset. I swear to you--

388
00:37:30,401 --> 00:37:32,569
Swear as much as you like.

389
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,743
That is not Julia's handwriting.

390
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:42,663
That is the handwriting of a stranger.

391
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,082
A person unknown.

392
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,584
At least to me.

393
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:19,491
-Where is she?
-I was going to send for you.

394
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:20,909
Where is she?

395
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,787
Go away, go away. Now get out!

396
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,008
Where did she go, Sara?

397
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:40,095
I don't know. She sent me to
the post office. When I come back--

398
00:39:20,135 --> 00:39:23,263
She's not coming back, is she, Sara?

399
00:39:23,555 --> 00:39:25,015
She never was here.

400
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:29,103
You've been married to a dream.

401
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:32,356
A dream that stole your soul.

402
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,384
Luis! What is it?

403
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:10,394
Your wife appeared at five minutes to
three for a last-minute withdrawal.

404
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:15,065
As you instructed,
I gave her full access to your accounts.

405
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,193
Your balance at closing was...

406
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:21,864
...51 American dollars and 40 cents
in one account...

407
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:23,866
...ten dollars in the other.

408
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:32,666
As I explained to your wife,
to help close both out completely...

409
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:35,377
...your signature
would have been necessary.

410
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,384
I'm sorry.

411
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:13,040
Don Luis?

412
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,366
God must have been angry with you
that day...

413
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:50,869
...he let you look in that woman's face.

414
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,969
I want her back. Sara...

415
00:42:09,555 --> 00:42:11,223
...l want her back.

416
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,688
No, cariño. What for?

417
00:42:19,315 --> 00:42:21,775
What for you want her back again?

418
00:43:57,403 --> 00:43:59,572
No, this is not a love story.

419
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,576
But it is a story about love.

420
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:09,832
about those who give in to it,
and the price they pay.

421
00:44:13,377 --> 00:44:16,589
and those who run away from it
because they are afraid...

422
00:44:18,174 --> 00:44:21,510
...or because they do not believe
they are worthy of it.

423
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:25,848
She ran away.

424
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:28,184
He gave in.

425
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:29,935
Mr. Vargas?

426
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:33,564
Walter Downs.

427
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:38,944
What a happy coincidence.

428
00:44:40,029 --> 00:44:41,363
Oh, yeah.

429
00:44:42,907 --> 00:44:44,575
I remember you.

430
00:44:50,498 --> 00:44:54,168
And the authorities here could do nothing?

431
00:44:57,338 --> 00:44:58,964
After all...

432
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:02,468
...there was no crime.

433
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:08,682
She was my wife.
She just took what I had given her.

434
00:45:11,435 --> 00:45:12,770
Your money.

435
00:45:14,855 --> 00:45:16,273
And your love.

436
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:20,820
And you did not suspect?

437
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:30,788
It seems that I know a lot less
about women than I thought I did.

438
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:33,040
And I know too much.

439
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:35,918
Consequently, I've not much use for them...

440
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:38,254
...apart from the necessities.

441
00:45:38,712 --> 00:45:41,882
For real intercourse,
I prefer the company of men.

442
00:45:43,259 --> 00:45:44,593
Listen to me.

443
00:45:46,429 --> 00:45:48,097
Could you find her?

444
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:53,269
Perhaps.

445
00:45:55,146 --> 00:45:57,940
But I am, at the moment...

446
00:45:58,065 --> 00:46:02,069
...engaged to find the real Julia,
the one you were meant to marry.

447
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:06,282
Have you found her?

448
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,452
Have you found her?

449
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,955
Not yet.

450
00:46:12,997 --> 00:46:15,207
If you do... if you do...

451
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:18,794
...she might lead you to the Julia I married.

452
00:46:20,254 --> 00:46:21,547
Perhaps.

453
00:46:22,673 --> 00:46:24,008
And vice versa.

454
00:46:26,886 --> 00:46:31,140
As much as you want I will pay,
if you can find her for me.

455
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:33,601
That's all I want.

456
00:46:34,185 --> 00:46:37,188
Then I assume you have made up
your losses.

457
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,066
As much as you want, I will pay, I said it.

458
00:46:41,442 --> 00:46:42,735
I will pay.

459
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,237
Yes, I believe you would.

460
00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:48,073
And if I did find your Julia?

461
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:50,910
If I brought her to you...

462
00:46:51,702 --> 00:46:53,454
...or you to her...

463
00:46:54,872 --> 00:46:57,541
...what good would it possibly do you?

464
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,293
Money's gone.

465
00:47:01,212 --> 00:47:02,546
The love...

466
00:47:03,297 --> 00:47:04,590
...ruined.

467
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:08,219
What could you possibly want with her?

468
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:12,223
What could you possibly want?

469
00:47:18,521 --> 00:47:20,189
I want to kill her.

470
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:44,596
Yes, I do recall this lady.

471
00:47:45,013 --> 00:47:47,349
Slim and dark and very....

472
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:52,396
I remember, coming along the deck
and the breeze catching her skirt.

473
00:47:52,855 --> 00:47:54,356
She was coming towards me.

474
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:59,236
She quickly held it down with her hand
and as she passed, she smiled.

475
00:48:00,154 --> 00:48:03,490
I believe she was traveling
with a troupe of American actors...

476
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:04,742
...touring the island.

477
00:48:04,992 --> 00:48:07,161
Oh, yes, I remember.

478
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:10,622
Because she rolled up some lettuce in her napkin.

479
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:15,461
I thought it was strange.
She explained it was for her bird.

480
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:17,713
She was traveling with a bird.

481
00:48:18,213 --> 00:48:21,133
Oh, yes. I remember her.

482
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:24,011
A lady with a birdcage...

483
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,014
...but this doesn't look like her.

484
00:48:27,598 --> 00:48:29,892
She was young and very pretty.

485
00:48:31,435 --> 00:48:32,936
Yes, that's her.

486
00:48:34,688 --> 00:48:37,441
and the real Julia never appears, because...

487
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,318
...she is dead.

488
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:44,865
-You mean murder.
-Yes.

489
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:48,660
She could have had an accomplice.

490
00:48:48,869 --> 00:48:51,121
These women often have an accomplice.

491
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,083
Someone she might use and then discard.

492
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:58,921
Someone who might even now be
in pursuit of her, just as you and I are.

493
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:02,674
This is where it happened.

494
00:49:03,342 --> 00:49:05,344
Here in Havana.

495
00:50:05,904 --> 00:50:08,198
This way, gentlemen. Welcome to Havana.

496
00:50:08,574 --> 00:50:11,076
Mr. Downs will be in room 37...

497
00:50:11,118 --> 00:50:14,788
...and Mr. Vargas will be just down the hall
in room 42.

498
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,377
I'll hook myself up
with the local authorities...

499
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:24,173
...and see if any dead bodies
have turned up recently.

500
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,341
You're welcome to join me.

501
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:30,554
No, thank you.

502
00:50:31,555 --> 00:50:35,851
Havana is a very accommodating city,
especially during Carnival.

503
00:50:36,226 --> 00:50:40,564
I suggest the Opera Restaurant.
It's just across the street.

504
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:45,235
It's very popular with American tourists.

505
00:50:50,657 --> 00:50:53,702
Why don't you do something
pleasant tonight?

506
00:50:54,286 --> 00:50:58,791
Treat yourself to a good dinner,
a good cigar and a good whore?

507
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:01,460
I prefer to be alone.

508
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:10,719
So I'll leave you on your own, then.

509
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,031
Here you are.

510
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:16,994
Privacy, and a view of the room.
If you see anything...

511
00:52:17,327 --> 00:52:22,666
...or anyone who interests you, let me
know and I'll see what I can arrange.

512
00:52:40,434 --> 00:52:45,147
If I could have my coffee every morning
before I dressed, I would be very happy.

513
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,399
It would change the day.

514
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:50,903
I would be very happy.

515
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:52,946
It would change the day.

516
00:52:54,323 --> 00:52:56,366
Then that is what you shall have.

517
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:00,871
When we are married,
you shall have everything you wish.

518
00:53:01,997 --> 00:53:04,958
Married? Your wife might have
something to say about that.

519
00:53:05,584 --> 00:53:07,461
This way, Colonel, s'il vous plaît.

520
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:10,339
S'il vous plaît indeed,
you silly mountebank.

521
00:53:10,506 --> 00:53:14,551
-You're about as French as my asshole!
-Edwin, curb your tongue.

522
00:53:24,978 --> 00:53:27,147
May I help you, sir?

523
00:53:28,148 --> 00:53:30,692
I thought I saw an old friend of mine.

524
00:53:31,151 --> 00:53:32,111
Colonel....

525
00:53:32,194 --> 00:53:33,654
-Colonel Worth?
-Yes.

526
00:53:33,737 --> 00:53:35,197
Oh, yes. This way.

527
00:53:35,322 --> 00:53:36,615
No, no, no.

528
00:53:37,408 --> 00:53:39,493
I wouldn't bother him now.

529
00:53:40,577 --> 00:53:42,204
Is he staying at the hotel?

530
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:46,458
No, he's at home in Havana.
He lives at avenida Medios.

531
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:49,378
I believe his fiancée is at the hotel.

532
00:53:50,754 --> 00:53:51,755
Fiancée?

533
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,674
Yes, Miss Castle.

534
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:57,010
Yes, yes.

535
00:53:57,761 --> 00:53:59,930
I see. Thank you.

536
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,956
My dear, I don't have that kind of money.

537
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:27,624
But, my dear, you do.

538
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:31,336
Your annual expenditures
are $200,000, more or less.

539
00:54:32,629 --> 00:54:34,131
How do you know that?

540
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:37,092
Because, under favorable conditions,
you could realize...

541
00:54:37,176 --> 00:54:41,889
...at least 1.5 million pounds of sugar
in good seasons.

542
00:54:41,972 --> 00:54:43,182
Five cents a pound--

543
00:54:43,265 --> 00:54:47,311
No, don't.
Don't make me talk about business now.

544
00:54:51,023 --> 00:54:53,358
I've been waiting for this all night.

545
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:04,870
Now, don't watch.

546
00:55:05,287 --> 00:55:07,122
Be kind, my dove.

547
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,124
Be kind to an old man.

548
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:10,876
I am kind.

549
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:12,795
Kind as I have ever been.

550
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:24,848
Will you undo my dress, please?

551
00:55:25,682 --> 00:55:27,601
Oh, yes.

552
00:55:27,851 --> 00:55:29,770
Let me have thatpleasure.

553
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:36,819
That's enough. Thank you.

554
00:55:37,277 --> 00:55:38,570
Thank you...

555
00:55:39,488 --> 00:55:41,532
...for a wonderful evening. Good night.

556
00:55:41,615 --> 00:55:42,866
-No.
-Yes.

557
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:46,078
I'll behave. I'll only sit and watch you.

558
00:55:46,954 --> 00:55:48,288
You see...

559
00:55:48,872 --> 00:55:50,541
...l sit...

560
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,459
...and I watch.

561
00:55:52,626 --> 00:55:54,795
Is that what you want?

562
00:55:56,255 --> 00:55:59,508
You are very tiresome and I am very tired.

563
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:02,219
-Good night.
-No.

564
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:06,598
-No.
-Good night. Yes.

565
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,808
No.

566
00:56:08,475 --> 00:56:11,645
Mayn't I stay? Please, let me stay.

567
00:56:16,483 --> 00:56:18,986
Darling dove, I'm weeping.

568
00:56:19,528 --> 00:56:21,697
My heart is pudding.

569
00:56:24,366 --> 00:56:25,576
I'll go.

570
00:56:26,368 --> 00:56:28,871
But my pudding is all broken.

571
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:31,790
Good night...

572
00:56:32,624 --> 00:56:34,376
...my little dove.

573
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:36,962
Good night.

574
00:56:38,464 --> 00:56:40,632
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

575
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:32,643
It's only me, Julia.

576
00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:38,732
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

577
00:57:44,363 --> 00:57:45,864
Who's Billy?

578
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:49,493
Just a fellow.

579
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:54,331
There must be quite a few
fellows in your life.

580
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:57,209
Billy...

581
00:57:58,168 --> 00:57:59,378
...me...

582
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,505
...the Colonel.

583
00:58:02,464 --> 00:58:04,133
Did you marry all of them?

584
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:07,010
-No, just you.
-Liar.

585
00:58:08,303 --> 00:58:09,680
Liar.

586
00:58:14,184 --> 00:58:15,477
Liar.

587
00:58:23,318 --> 00:58:25,195
Well, what is it, then?

588
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,655
What is it?

589
00:58:27,656 --> 00:58:29,199
What are your plans for me?

590
00:58:30,033 --> 00:58:31,410
My plans?

591
00:58:32,953 --> 00:58:35,289
I just came here to kill you.

592
00:58:43,672 --> 00:58:45,174
My God.

593
00:58:48,677 --> 00:58:50,679
All right, do it.

594
00:58:58,896 --> 00:59:01,148
There. There's my heart. Don't hesitate.

595
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:03,650
Your money's gone. Do it.

596
00:59:04,485 --> 00:59:05,652
Gone.

597
00:59:06,862 --> 00:59:08,614
Like the woman you murdered?

598
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:12,034
What? No.

599
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,791
You were with her on that boat!
You were seen together!

600
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:23,712
-I wasn't alone.
-She told you all about me, didn't she?

601
00:59:23,962 --> 00:59:25,089
No!

602
00:59:25,756 --> 00:59:27,257
I told him!

603
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:32,388
The next day, he told me she'd had
an accident and to take her place. So I did.

604
00:59:34,098 --> 00:59:35,474
Another man?

605
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:37,351
Accomplice?

606
00:59:37,434 --> 00:59:39,228
Friend? Lover?

607
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:40,604
An accomplice--

608
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:45,692
You saw us together,
backstage, at the play.

609
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:48,904
My friend, my accomplice and...

610
00:59:49,363 --> 00:59:51,740
...yes, yes, my lover.

611
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:55,536
He was an actor, like myself.
Actors playing parts.

612
00:59:57,246 --> 01:00:00,999
I told him that night I didn't want
to go through with it. I couldn't--

613
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:03,168
Why not?

614
01:00:03,419 --> 01:00:04,670
Because!

615
01:00:05,254 --> 01:00:07,172
Because I was....

616
01:00:07,506 --> 01:00:09,967
Damn it.
I was falling in love with my own husband.

617
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,719
Again. Liar.

618
01:00:14,638 --> 01:00:18,308
I could have bought him off!
I could have kept him away!

619
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,520
But you made me write her sister
and then it was all over!

620
01:00:21,812 --> 01:00:22,813
Whore!

621
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,356
Thief!

622
01:00:25,941 --> 01:00:28,694
It's how I live. It's all I know.

623
01:00:28,777 --> 01:00:31,989
I took the money and I gave it to him.

624
01:00:34,241 --> 01:00:36,243
Then I ran.

625
01:00:41,999 --> 01:00:43,667
What does it matter?

626
01:00:43,876 --> 01:00:45,502
What does it matter?

627
01:00:45,544 --> 01:00:46,879
It's over.

628
01:00:49,465 --> 01:00:50,883
Whore!

629
01:00:50,924 --> 01:00:52,468
Liar! Thief!

630
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:53,844
Yes!

631
01:00:54,011 --> 01:00:56,388
Don't you see...

632
01:00:57,056 --> 01:00:59,683
...that I cannot breathe without you?

633
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:01,351
I cannot live without you!

634
01:01:01,477 --> 01:01:04,229
Don't you see that?
Don't you see how much I love you?

635
01:01:10,819 --> 01:01:13,030
I'm sorry.

636
01:01:49,066 --> 01:01:50,734
Where am l?

637
01:01:54,738 --> 01:01:56,073
Who are you?

638
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:01,245
Really.

639
01:02:02,162 --> 01:02:03,789
My name is Bonny.

640
01:02:05,124 --> 01:02:06,583
Bonny Castle.

641
01:02:08,752 --> 01:02:10,254
Bonny Castle.

642
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:16,427
Is that your Christian name?

643
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:18,345
It would be...

644
01:02:19,054 --> 01:02:20,681
...if I were Christian.

645
01:02:21,473 --> 01:02:22,975
But I'm not.

646
01:02:24,727 --> 01:02:26,478
I was never baptized.

647
01:02:27,312 --> 01:02:29,022
I was a foundling.

648
01:02:31,608 --> 01:02:33,068
So was Billy.

649
01:02:43,954 --> 01:02:46,915
We were raised in an orphanage
outside of St. Louis.

650
01:02:48,667 --> 01:02:50,377
He gave me my name.

651
01:02:51,378 --> 01:02:54,298
He saw it on a picture postcard
from Scotland.

652
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:59,386
It had a drawing on it,
of a "bonny castle", it said.

653
01:03:00,929 --> 01:03:04,058
When we were 14, we ran away together.

654
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:08,896
Like brother, sister, father, daughter,
husband, wife.

655
01:03:09,813 --> 01:03:11,690
-He was my salvation.
-No.

656
01:03:16,445 --> 01:03:18,238
I don't want to know.

657
01:03:20,157 --> 01:03:21,325
Not now.

658
01:03:23,952 --> 01:03:27,956
You are Julia Russell
from Wilmington, Delaware.

659
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:32,002
You were born...

660
01:03:32,544 --> 01:03:34,755
...the day you stepped off that boat...

661
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,716
...and became my wife.

662
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:43,972
But then...

663
01:03:44,056 --> 01:03:46,725
...l am not Julia Russell at all, am l?

664
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,230
I'm simply your wife.

665
01:04:44,366 --> 01:04:46,368
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

666
01:04:46,702 --> 01:04:48,829
It's Edwin, my dear.

667
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:51,290
Am I too early?

668
01:04:52,124 --> 01:04:53,792
Don't hurry.

669
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:59,131
Nothing gives me more pleasure than
to wait for you outside your door.

670
01:05:00,382 --> 01:05:03,635
Unless, of course, you were to let me in.

671
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,611
-Colonel Worth.
-Good God!

672
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:23,614
-May I help you, sir?
-You are not dressed, sir.

673
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:25,616
No, I am not.

674
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,078
I am engaged at the moment
in a private function.

675
01:05:29,161 --> 01:05:32,581
A function for which clothes
are a hindrance, not a help.

676
01:05:32,664 --> 01:05:33,832
A private function?

677
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,042
Yes, sir.

678
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,628
With Bonny? A private function?

679
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,588
Good God, man!

680
01:05:39,797 --> 01:05:42,966
But I am being rude. Please come in.

681
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:45,552
No, sir. Are you mad?

682
01:05:45,636 --> 01:05:47,262
Mad? No.

683
01:05:48,138 --> 01:05:52,643
I am only curious to know
what your business is at my wife's door.

684
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,940
Your wife?

685
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:00,692
Did you say, "wife"?

686
01:06:01,151 --> 01:06:03,112
Edwin, be careful.

687
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,280
He has a fearful temper.

688
01:06:06,865 --> 01:06:08,909
I beg your pardon, sir. I do.

689
01:06:09,785 --> 01:06:11,412
I beg your pardon.

690
01:06:11,954 --> 01:06:13,747
I am an old fool.

691
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:15,916
I didn't know.

692
01:06:18,377 --> 01:06:19,420
I'm sorry.

693
01:06:26,427 --> 01:06:28,429
Good morning to you, sir.

694
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:30,556
Good morning.

695
01:06:38,897 --> 01:06:40,065
You see?

696
01:06:41,859 --> 01:06:43,527
You have no past.

697
01:06:44,778 --> 01:06:47,114
It is gone. Finished.

698
01:06:47,781 --> 01:06:49,450
Disappeared.

699
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:53,829
You have only me now.

700
01:07:14,725 --> 01:07:17,311
There you are. You weren't in your room.

701
01:07:18,062 --> 01:07:20,522
I have some very interesting news.

702
01:07:20,564 --> 01:07:22,066
So do l.

703
01:07:29,573 --> 01:07:31,241
"A woman's body found."

704
01:07:31,575 --> 01:07:34,036
"Foul play suspected." How's my Spanish?

705
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:38,749
Julia Russell?

706
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:43,545
Stabbed in the neck with a small knife,
then thrown overboard.

707
01:07:43,712 --> 01:07:47,049
Probably the work of a man,
but could've easily been a woman.

708
01:07:47,257 --> 01:07:50,219
The blade of the knife
was still in her throat.

709
01:07:52,262 --> 01:07:54,431
And so your wife...

710
01:07:55,015 --> 01:07:57,393
...is now officially a fugitive.

711
01:07:57,476 --> 01:08:00,270
Not only are we pursuing her,
but the police, too.

712
01:08:01,563 --> 01:08:03,565
Cheer up. This is good news.

713
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:05,818
It won't be long until she's caught.

714
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,861
She...

715
01:08:08,529 --> 01:08:10,197
...didn't do this.

716
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:16,203
I believe you still love her.

717
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:21,542
Of course.

718
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:26,046
How could you hate her so much if you
did not still love her?

719
01:08:28,465 --> 01:08:31,635
Trust me, my friend.
There's no such thing as love.

720
01:08:31,844 --> 01:08:34,221
Only misguided feelings and emotions.

721
01:08:34,555 --> 01:08:37,266
It was my knife. He used my knife.

722
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:41,645
-It wasn't me, I promise you.
-I believe you.

723
01:08:42,146 --> 01:08:44,398
No one else will believe I'm innocent.

724
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:45,816
Listen to me.

725
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:48,360
No one else matters. Not to me.

726
01:09:00,456 --> 01:09:02,124
What are you thinking?

727
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,376
Of you.

728
01:09:12,468 --> 01:09:14,470
Welcome to Cardenas.

729
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:18,932
Right this way. This is the entrance.
It's very elegant...

730
01:09:19,516 --> 01:09:21,685
...in a very good part of town.

731
01:09:22,144 --> 01:09:25,731
Mostly Americans and tourists
from the Continent.

732
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:30,819
I think you'll find all the furnishings
you need included.

733
01:09:31,028 --> 01:09:32,654
a bedroom...

734
01:09:32,946 --> 01:09:35,616
...a sitting room, a very good kitchen.

735
01:09:39,203 --> 01:09:42,373
Here in Cardenas,
you are close to Havana...

736
01:09:42,539 --> 01:09:44,708
...but very far away.

737
01:09:45,376 --> 01:09:50,214
We are known for the waters
and for the healing powers of the sun.

738
01:10:25,741 --> 01:10:26,909
Vargas.

739
01:10:28,911 --> 01:10:30,245
What a happy accident.

740
01:10:30,579 --> 01:10:32,414
Yes, indeed.

741
01:10:34,124 --> 01:10:36,126
What brings you to Cardenas?

742
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:38,712
Not a rest cure, I assure you.

743
01:10:39,588 --> 01:10:41,548
No, of course not.

744
01:10:41,924 --> 01:10:45,260
There were reports of a woman
answering a certain description.

745
01:10:45,594 --> 01:10:47,721
She was seen boarding an eastbound train.

746
01:10:48,013 --> 01:10:51,391
You haven't seen or heard anything,
have you?

747
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:55,228
I've lost my taste for women
of that description.

748
01:10:55,938 --> 01:10:57,522
Glad to hear of it.

749
01:11:00,233 --> 01:11:02,069
Listen...

750
01:11:03,362 --> 01:11:05,030
...can I offer you a piñales?

751
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:06,573
What's that?

752
01:11:07,032 --> 01:11:08,367
A drink.

753
01:11:10,327 --> 01:11:12,204
There's a cafe down the street.

754
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,543
The sun is warm.

755
01:11:19,378 --> 01:11:22,089
Your face, for instance, is quite moist.

756
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:35,352
The body was positively identified
by her sister.

757
01:11:35,727 --> 01:11:38,522
Very sad, but very accurate.

758
01:11:38,897 --> 01:11:42,025
Two moles high on the inner thigh...

759
01:11:42,859 --> 01:11:45,070
...and a gold crown on a back tooth.

760
01:11:45,404 --> 01:11:49,533
And on her left hand, a small, round scar.

761
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:51,868
Very interesting.

762
01:11:54,121 --> 01:11:57,040
Will you excuse me?
I have to use the convenience.

763
01:11:57,332 --> 01:11:59,001
By all means.

764
01:12:01,003 --> 01:12:02,671
Do as you must.

765
01:12:35,495 --> 01:12:36,830
Julia?

766
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,502
Come upstairs. We....

767
01:12:44,504 --> 01:12:45,839
Ah, Luis.

768
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:48,967
I am disappointed.

769
01:12:51,678 --> 01:12:54,348
And yet full of admiration.

770
01:12:58,393 --> 01:12:59,728
Where is she?

771
01:12:59,811 --> 01:13:01,146
Who? No.

772
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,231
-She's not here.
-You called her name.

773
01:13:03,315 --> 01:13:04,942
You have no business here.

774
01:13:05,317 --> 01:13:08,946
Downs, please. Be smart and leave.
Get out while you can.

775
01:13:09,321 --> 01:13:10,280
She's mine, Luis.

776
01:13:10,447 --> 01:13:12,491
Give her up, before it's too late.

777
01:13:13,158 --> 01:13:15,452
You are aiding a criminal!

778
01:13:16,036 --> 01:13:19,373
And you are close
to becoming one yourself.

779
01:13:19,456 --> 01:13:21,124
Come to your senses.

780
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:24,628
You saw it. She's not here. Now, please.

781
01:13:24,962 --> 01:13:27,339
Don't lie to me, Mr. Vargas.

782
01:13:27,881 --> 01:13:29,716
I can smell her on you.

783
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:33,428
Her perfume, stinking on your clothing.

784
01:13:33,971 --> 01:13:35,847
You just left her, didn't you?

785
01:13:35,931 --> 01:13:37,891
That's it. Get out.

786
01:13:40,143 --> 01:13:43,438
Did she throw her arms around you?
Embrace you, like this?

787
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,817
Did she rub her cheek against yours,
like this?

788
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,319
Did she kiss you on the mouth?

789
01:13:49,569 --> 01:13:52,406
If I kiss you now, will I taste her on you?

790
01:14:07,212 --> 01:14:08,922
You would do this for her?

791
01:14:10,966 --> 01:14:12,467
Wait!

792
01:14:12,593 --> 01:14:13,719
Wait.

793
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:17,931
Speak of the devil, and she appears.

794
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:28,108
My God. What have you done?

795
01:14:28,442 --> 01:14:30,110
What have you done?

796
01:14:30,402 --> 01:14:31,737
It's him.

797
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:34,406
It's the detective.

798
01:14:35,949 --> 01:14:37,618
He came here for you.

799
01:14:46,668 --> 01:14:48,754
What are you doing? Don't touch him.

800
01:14:48,837 --> 01:14:50,547
Don't touch him!

801
01:14:58,013 --> 01:15:00,641
-Did he come here alone?
-Yes.

802
01:15:00,974 --> 01:15:02,643
No one saw him come in?

803
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:06,313
I don't know.

804
01:15:06,647 --> 01:15:08,649
Christ, Julia.

805
01:15:09,483 --> 01:15:10,901
I've killed a man.

806
01:15:11,485 --> 01:15:13,737
You need to go to the train station.

807
01:15:13,987 --> 01:15:17,491
Buy two seats on the morning train east,
no matter where.

808
01:15:19,493 --> 01:15:23,205
I will contact the estate agent
and tell him we've changed our minds...

809
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:25,749
...and there's been an emergency.

810
01:15:27,709 --> 01:15:29,002
Julia.

811
01:15:30,879 --> 01:15:32,339
Yes, what?

812
01:15:34,049 --> 01:15:35,968
I've just killed a man.

813
01:15:37,844 --> 01:15:39,680
And I just bought a hat.

814
01:15:43,183 --> 01:15:48,188
But I don't dwell on it. I don't say
over and over, "I just bought a hat."

815
01:15:48,522 --> 01:15:51,358
"I just bought a hat." It doesn't matter.

816
01:15:53,026 --> 01:15:55,362
It's done. Help me.

817
01:15:57,155 --> 01:15:58,323
God.

818
01:16:10,002 --> 01:16:12,546
-That should do it.
-I'll bring him down.

819
01:16:13,505 --> 01:16:16,133
No, go to the station
before the window closes.

820
01:16:17,676 --> 01:16:19,678
Come here. Put these on.

821
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,013
Yes, I'll hurry.

822
01:16:21,096 --> 01:16:22,723
No. Don't hurry.

823
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:26,393
Go slowly, enjoy the walk
and no one will notice you.

824
01:16:26,977 --> 01:16:28,770
-Understand?
-Yes.

825
01:17:03,013 --> 01:17:04,348
Billy.

826
01:17:05,933 --> 01:17:07,517
You finally got what you deserved.

827
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:23,825
-Jesus!
-Aren't you glad to see me?

828
01:17:23,909 --> 01:17:26,495
Aren't you glad
to see old Detective Downs again?

829
01:17:26,662 --> 01:17:27,704
Should I be?

830
01:17:27,955 --> 01:17:31,083
I got very good notices
playing this part in Chicago.

831
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:32,709
Or don't you remember?

832
01:17:32,793 --> 01:17:34,586
Let go of me, Billy.

833
01:17:34,795 --> 01:17:37,130
You thought I was...

834
01:17:37,965 --> 01:17:39,633
...really dead...

835
01:17:41,176 --> 01:17:42,469
...didn't you?

836
01:17:53,272 --> 01:17:55,857
Did you think
there were real bullets in that gun?

837
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,736
You think they were real
the night he came to murder you?

838
01:18:00,904 --> 01:18:05,409
I couldn't risk his putting out your lights,
not before I caught up with you.

839
01:18:06,577 --> 01:18:08,537
-Let go of me, Billy.
-Never.

840
01:18:08,745 --> 01:18:11,248
-Not till you come back to the game.
-What game?

841
01:18:11,331 --> 01:18:13,292
The skin game, darling.

842
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:14,710
There is no game.

843
01:18:14,918 --> 01:18:16,712
Yes. I see it so clearly.

844
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,589
No, no.

845
01:18:19,423 --> 01:18:20,924
What do you see?

846
01:18:23,093 --> 01:18:26,597
I see him running out of money.
I see you arranging that.

847
01:18:27,055 --> 01:18:29,308
I see him doing the only thing he can do.

848
01:18:29,391 --> 01:18:33,020
I see him going to Santiago,
selling his share of the company.

849
01:18:33,103 --> 01:18:35,439
I see him coming back with money.

850
01:18:35,606 --> 01:18:37,232
I see us...

851
01:18:37,441 --> 01:18:39,192
...finishing what we started.

852
01:18:39,776 --> 01:18:41,194
You and me together.

853
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,989
We're going to make you a rich widow.

854
01:18:49,953 --> 01:18:53,373
He's worth a hell of a lot more
than we got out of him the first time.

855
01:18:53,457 --> 01:18:56,919
And he's such an easy mark,
devoted as he is to you.

856
01:18:57,377 --> 01:19:02,007
Bound together as you are
by mutual crimes and various...

857
01:19:02,424 --> 01:19:03,926
...misdemeanors.

858
01:19:04,885 --> 01:19:07,054
-Let go of me.
-Beg.

859
01:19:07,387 --> 01:19:09,222
-Please, let go!
-Beg.

860
01:19:12,225 --> 01:19:15,562
It tickles my dick when you beg.

861
01:19:17,064 --> 01:19:19,566
He says he loves me.

862
01:19:22,569 --> 01:19:24,404
No one loves you, Bonny.

863
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:26,031
No one could.

864
01:19:26,406 --> 01:19:27,908
Except for me.

865
01:19:29,743 --> 01:19:31,119
He does.

866
01:19:31,495 --> 01:19:32,871
I think he does.

867
01:19:32,996 --> 01:19:35,999
Not enough to live the life of a fugitive.

868
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:40,087
Back alleys, cheap hotels....

869
01:19:40,337 --> 01:19:41,672
It won't be like that.

870
01:19:41,755 --> 01:19:43,507
How then? Happily ever after?

871
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:46,927
A nice, respectable couple,
living on Main Street?

872
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:50,097
Sunday dinners,
walks in the park with children?

873
01:19:51,265 --> 01:19:53,600
Christ, what's he done to you?

874
01:19:54,309 --> 01:19:56,311
Who do you think you are?

875
01:19:56,812 --> 01:19:58,855
Who does he think you are?

876
01:20:00,107 --> 01:20:02,109
You're a whore, Bonny.

877
01:20:02,359 --> 01:20:05,362
If a man puts his hands on you, you're wet.

878
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:09,032
True or not?

879
01:20:12,995 --> 01:20:14,955
You were born one and you'll die one.

880
01:20:15,205 --> 01:20:17,874
Sooner than later
if the police catch up with you.

881
01:20:20,961 --> 01:20:22,629
You wouldn't do that to me.

882
01:20:22,879 --> 01:20:26,216
I was your first man, Bonny.
Your very first.

883
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:28,927
And I will be...

884
01:20:29,094 --> 01:20:30,596
...your last.

885
01:20:32,139 --> 01:20:33,932
One way or another.

886
01:20:36,685 --> 01:20:39,187
There's no future with him, darling.

887
01:20:40,022 --> 01:20:41,857
Face the truth.

888
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:44,860
You can't live his life.

889
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,820
And he certainly...

890
01:20:47,237 --> 01:20:48,947
...can't live yours.

891
01:20:50,532 --> 01:20:52,034
Let him go.

892
01:20:54,953 --> 01:20:56,121
No.

893
01:20:56,288 --> 01:20:57,581
Let him go.

894
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:00,792
Let him go.

895
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:51,510
I was so hungry.

896
01:21:54,596 --> 01:21:57,849
What about him?
We have to get rid of the body.

897
01:21:58,767 --> 01:22:00,268
No, it's done.

898
01:22:01,561 --> 01:22:02,771
It's done?

899
01:22:05,732 --> 01:22:07,317
You mean you did it yourself?

900
01:22:08,234 --> 01:22:12,781
I packed all our things, as well.
I left one suit out on the bed, for the train.

901
01:22:13,615 --> 01:22:15,116
You get the tickets?

902
01:22:16,076 --> 01:22:18,036
-The tickets? Yes.
-Good.

903
01:22:18,244 --> 01:22:20,163
We go tomorrow in the morning.

904
01:22:20,246 --> 01:22:22,373
Back to Havana. 7:00.

905
01:22:24,876 --> 01:22:26,586
What an adventure.

906
01:22:29,714 --> 01:22:31,174
Come to bed.

907
01:22:32,425 --> 01:22:34,302
You must be exhausted.

908
01:22:34,636 --> 01:22:35,678
I know I am.

909
01:22:35,762 --> 01:22:38,098
Wait, wait, wait.

910
01:22:38,765 --> 01:22:41,101
Have you no conscience at all?

911
01:22:41,601 --> 01:22:42,936
I mean....

912
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,605
Yes, of course I do.

913
01:22:45,939 --> 01:22:49,275
But you see,
I don't let it get the best of me.

914
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,446
It's just something that happened.
It had to be done.

915
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,866
And when something has to be done,
you do it, right?

916
01:22:56,950 --> 01:23:01,287
So, here's to us.
A short life, but an exciting one.

917
01:23:06,209 --> 01:23:07,210
Good night.

918
01:23:12,382 --> 01:23:14,092
Listen to her talk.

919
01:23:14,551 --> 01:23:17,554
Listen to the words
that came out of her mouth.

920
01:23:17,637 --> 01:23:19,097
You mean Bonny?

921
01:23:19,889 --> 01:23:21,391
Yes, Bonny.

922
01:23:24,144 --> 01:23:26,604
Did you have no control over her?

923
01:23:28,314 --> 01:23:30,734
No one had control over her.

924
01:23:31,484 --> 01:23:32,944
No one did.

925
01:23:35,905 --> 01:23:38,742
No one, except for Billy.

926
01:23:40,076 --> 01:23:42,412
and he wanted the rest of the money.

927
01:23:45,915 --> 01:23:48,918
They found a house
in the poorsection of town.

928
01:23:49,252 --> 01:23:52,922
Bonny said they would go unnoticed there,
and she was right.

929
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,843
Many things would go unnoticed
in that house.

930
01:23:59,262 --> 01:24:01,681
all she had to do
was get Luis to Santiago...

931
01:24:03,183 --> 01:24:05,310
...and it would all be over.

932
01:24:11,691 --> 01:24:14,027
No, you don't understand.

933
01:24:15,361 --> 01:24:18,531
-We've run out?
-Yes, I'll go tomorrow to Santiago.

934
01:24:18,782 --> 01:24:21,201
I'll take the first train in the morning.

935
01:24:23,703 --> 01:24:25,413
What will you do there?

936
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:27,707
We need money, don't we?

937
01:24:29,876 --> 01:24:31,711
Whatever you say.

938
01:24:47,894 --> 01:24:50,313
I don't want you to go to Santiago.

939
01:24:52,232 --> 01:24:53,316
I have to go.

940
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,859
I don't want you to go.

941
01:24:55,235 --> 01:24:56,778
I have no choice.

942
01:24:57,904 --> 01:24:59,739
You do. You have a choice.

943
01:25:01,324 --> 01:25:02,700
Once again.

944
01:25:02,909 --> 01:25:05,537
-When my hand strays to my breast....
-Hearts.

945
01:25:05,912 --> 01:25:07,789
-My left eardrop.
-Diamonds.

946
01:25:07,914 --> 01:25:09,707
-My right eardrop.
-Clubs.

947
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,626
-My throat.
-Spades.

948
01:25:11,918 --> 01:25:14,504
-Little finger of my left hand.
-One.

949
01:25:14,671 --> 01:25:16,673
-Little finger of my right hand.
-Ten.

950
01:25:17,257 --> 01:25:19,551
When I do this,
it means they have nothing.

951
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:20,760
Right.

952
01:25:23,054 --> 01:25:24,806
-King, queen, jack.
-Yes.

953
01:25:26,266 --> 01:25:27,767
Yes.

954
01:25:29,519 --> 01:25:30,687
You're a natural.

955
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:32,939
-Listen--
-This is the way.

956
01:25:33,064 --> 01:25:35,066
This is the only way. This is our way.

957
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:38,236
This is you and me, together.

958
01:25:40,405 --> 01:25:41,740
Please.

959
01:25:45,034 --> 01:25:46,286
Now...

960
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:49,664
...tell me what I'm holding.

961
01:26:03,178 --> 01:26:05,138
Would you like more whiskey?

962
01:26:07,891 --> 01:26:09,058
Too rich for me.

963
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:13,188
Yes. Why not?

964
01:26:14,355 --> 01:26:17,025
Why not, indeed? All right.

965
01:26:18,693 --> 01:26:19,986
He wins again.

966
01:26:20,528 --> 01:26:22,363
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

967
01:26:22,864 --> 01:26:24,365
More champagne.

968
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:31,873
Does the lady mind if I remove my coat?

969
01:26:32,082 --> 01:26:34,084
No, do and say as you please.

970
01:26:34,459 --> 01:26:36,795
Try and forget that I am even here.

971
01:26:37,003 --> 01:26:38,463
Easier said than done.

972
01:26:43,843 --> 01:26:45,637
Can I get you another drink?

973
01:27:19,003 --> 01:27:21,589
Will you ask the lady to retire, sir?

974
01:27:24,426 --> 01:27:25,760
What do you mean?

975
01:27:25,844 --> 01:27:27,262
Do you have to be told?

976
01:27:28,471 --> 01:27:31,766
Take your hand from my wife. Please, sir.

977
01:27:33,184 --> 01:27:34,269
Gladly.

978
01:27:35,937 --> 01:27:39,274
If there's one thing lower
than a man who cheats at cards...

979
01:27:39,357 --> 01:27:42,777
...is a man who will use a woman to do
this cheating for him.

980
01:28:17,145 --> 01:28:18,480
Julia?

981
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:27,155
Well, my dear...

982
01:28:29,324 --> 01:28:32,494
...let's see
what other tricks you might know.

983
01:29:00,438 --> 01:29:02,190
Are you all right?

984
01:29:02,607 --> 01:29:03,775
Yes.

985
01:29:04,776 --> 01:29:05,944
Should l....

986
01:29:06,611 --> 01:29:08,947
Should I call someone?

987
01:29:13,284 --> 01:29:14,953
You are so kind.

988
01:29:17,455 --> 01:29:20,750
You are so young and innocent and kind.

989
01:29:23,586 --> 01:29:24,796
No.

990
01:29:25,713 --> 01:29:27,298
No one is innocent.

991
01:29:33,471 --> 01:29:35,640
You have a story as well.

992
01:29:37,642 --> 01:29:39,310
Will you tell me...

993
01:29:40,979 --> 01:29:42,647
...if there's time?

994
01:29:44,816 --> 01:29:46,776
I have no story.

995
01:29:48,153 --> 01:29:49,738
Not like yours.

996
01:29:50,655 --> 01:29:53,283
Well, it was Bonny's story now.

997
01:29:55,326 --> 01:29:57,162
and look what she had done.

998
01:30:00,081 --> 01:30:02,292
He could not live in her world.

999
01:30:02,917 --> 01:30:05,253
and she would never fit into his.

1000
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,809
Dear Alan:

1001
01:31:01,392 --> 01:31:03,061
Congratulations.

1002
01:31:03,645 --> 01:31:08,650
You have just purchased my share
of Vargas-Jordan Coffee Export House.

1003
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:13,405
The price I have settled on
is everything that was in the safe...

1004
01:31:13,738 --> 01:31:18,076
...which I believe is very much
in your favor. I'm sorry.

1005
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:19,911
Luis! Wait!

1006
01:31:20,078 --> 01:31:23,164
I'm sorry I couldn't wait
to discuss this with you.

1007
01:31:24,249 --> 01:31:28,211
But as you may know,
I am now a fugitive from justice.

1008
01:31:28,586 --> 01:31:30,922
More than that, I cannotsay.

1009
01:31:31,256 --> 01:31:33,216
What are you talking about?

1010
01:31:33,508 --> 01:31:34,509
Murder.

1011
01:31:36,428 --> 01:31:38,012
I have done murder.

1012
01:31:38,763 --> 01:31:40,390
-No.
-Yes.

1013
01:31:40,765 --> 01:31:42,225
I did it for her.

1014
01:31:43,601 --> 01:31:45,228
And the truth is...

1015
01:31:46,062 --> 01:31:47,689
...that I would do it again.

1016
01:31:51,735 --> 01:31:53,403
Good luck to you.

1017
01:31:53,737 --> 01:31:56,239
Thank you for having once been my friend.

1018
01:31:58,867 --> 01:32:00,201
Go on.

1019
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:08,168
God help you.

1020
01:34:06,681 --> 01:34:08,349
Will you light me a cigar?

1021
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:13,479
I'll make us some coffee.

1022
01:34:21,529 --> 01:34:22,780
Damn!

1023
01:34:22,864 --> 01:34:24,824
-What happened?
-There's a rat.

1024
01:34:24,991 --> 01:34:28,036
-A rat?
-There's a rat. It ran right over my foot.

1025
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:30,913
Do you see it?

1026
01:34:31,622 --> 01:34:32,623
No.

1027
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:39,839
-I didn't see it.
-No?

1028
01:34:39,881 --> 01:34:41,215
What are you doing?

1029
01:34:41,424 --> 01:34:43,092
Going to the pharmacist.

1030
01:34:43,426 --> 01:34:45,219
-At this hour?
-Yes.

1031
01:34:45,470 --> 01:34:48,640
-It's 9.00. It's closed.
-I know one open till 10:00.

1032
01:34:48,681 --> 01:34:51,351
-What are you doing? Wait.
-I won't be long.

1033
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:50,928
You can't save him, darling.
If that's what you're thinking.

1034
01:36:51,012 --> 01:36:53,681
Why not? Why can't we just go?

1035
01:36:54,724 --> 01:36:56,893
I have two tickets for us on the train.

1036
01:36:57,435 --> 01:36:59,562
Tonight, midnight. We have the money.

1037
01:37:00,104 --> 01:37:00,855
Leave him.

1038
01:37:00,938 --> 01:37:04,734
Bonny, it doesn't suit you,
this kind of compassion.

1039
01:37:06,277 --> 01:37:10,073
How could I trust you?
There'd always be someone between us.

1040
01:37:10,365 --> 01:37:12,033
Why hurt him?

1041
01:37:12,241 --> 01:37:14,243
He's a part of you that must die.

1042
01:37:14,535 --> 01:37:17,997
You need to kill it,
or I promise you, it will kill you.

1043
01:37:19,248 --> 01:37:21,042
What are you doing? Billy?

1044
01:37:21,084 --> 01:37:24,545
I'm going back with you,
to finish the job and have done with it.

1045
01:37:24,587 --> 01:37:27,924
-You'll have the police all over us.
-Then do as you're told.

1046
01:37:28,007 --> 01:37:29,258
Do it now.

1047
01:37:40,103 --> 01:37:41,729
-Say it.
-Billy--

1048
01:37:41,813 --> 01:37:44,148
Say you're mine. You're mine. Say it.

1049
01:37:44,232 --> 01:37:45,525
Yes, what?

1050
01:37:45,817 --> 01:37:47,652
Yes, I'm yours.

1051
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:32,322
You startled me.

1052
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:35,408
You took a long time.

1053
01:38:39,537 --> 01:38:41,331
What are you doing in the dark?

1054
01:38:41,581 --> 01:38:42,915
Thinking.

1055
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:45,126
What are you thinking?

1056
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:51,007
I was thinking that if I ever lost you,
my life would be over.

1057
01:38:52,675 --> 01:38:55,011
There would be nothing left for me.

1058
01:38:56,304 --> 01:38:57,972
Except to die.

1059
01:39:01,684 --> 01:39:03,353
Don't say such things.

1060
01:39:05,188 --> 01:39:07,148
Did you find what you were looking for?

1061
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:08,775
Yes, I did.

1062
01:39:09,484 --> 01:39:11,611
I had to go all the way across town.

1063
01:39:16,324 --> 01:39:18,117
I'm going to go change.

1064
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:33,800
Wash your hands and go to bed.
I'll bring the coffee.

1065
01:40:01,327 --> 01:40:02,787
There you are.

1066
01:40:18,177 --> 01:40:20,013
How do they die, you think?

1067
01:40:23,683 --> 01:40:25,184
From the poison?

1068
01:40:26,519 --> 01:40:27,854
I don't know.

1069
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:34,861
Does it take a long time?

1070
01:40:37,613 --> 01:40:40,283
I suppose it depends on
how much you give them.

1071
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:42,368
That's right.

1072
01:40:45,371 --> 01:40:46,706
Is it painful?

1073
01:40:47,373 --> 01:40:49,792
I really don't want to think about it.

1074
01:40:52,462 --> 01:40:54,297
No, of course not.

1075
01:40:54,756 --> 01:40:59,260
We don't want our conscience
to get the best of us, do we?

1076
01:41:01,554 --> 01:41:04,515
It's something that has to be done.

1077
01:41:05,391 --> 01:41:07,685
And when something has to be done...

1078
01:41:08,728 --> 01:41:10,229
...you do it.

1079
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:12,357
Is your coffee too hot?

1080
01:41:12,899 --> 01:41:14,233
I saw him.

1081
01:41:17,695 --> 01:41:19,030
Who?

1082
01:41:21,074 --> 01:41:22,575
I followed you.

1083
01:41:23,409 --> 01:41:24,827
You saw who? Where?

1084
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:27,413
Julia.

1085
01:41:29,082 --> 01:41:31,376
Shall we play the game...

1086
01:41:31,459 --> 01:41:33,753
...or just speak the truth?

1087
01:41:36,756 --> 01:41:38,257
The truth is best.

1088
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:40,093
All right, then.

1089
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,179
Is he here?

1090
01:41:45,181 --> 01:41:46,349
Yes.

1091
01:41:47,809 --> 01:41:48,977
Where?

1092
01:41:49,686 --> 01:41:52,522
Outside, waiting.
When I turn the lights off.

1093
01:41:53,189 --> 01:41:54,691
When I am dead?

1094
01:41:56,859 --> 01:41:58,027
Yes.

1095
01:42:02,490 --> 01:42:04,701
I led him to you in Havana, didn't l?

1096
01:42:05,827 --> 01:42:06,786
Yes.

1097
01:42:08,204 --> 01:42:10,164
How'd he know I wouldn't kill you?

1098
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:14,711
He put blank cartridges in your gun.

1099
01:42:24,053 --> 01:42:25,388
Like a play.

1100
01:42:27,223 --> 01:42:28,558
All of it.

1101
01:42:30,893 --> 01:42:32,228
Lies.

1102
01:42:33,563 --> 01:42:35,481
From the moment I met you.

1103
01:42:36,566 --> 01:42:38,401
Not all of it, no.

1104
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:41,946
Do you laugh at me behind my back,
the two of you?

1105
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:47,660
Do you laugh at me
for how stupid I have been?

1106
01:42:49,829 --> 01:42:51,164
How blind?

1107
01:42:53,124 --> 01:42:54,334
No.

1108
01:42:55,627 --> 01:42:57,962
Laugh now when I tell you this.

1109
01:42:59,964 --> 01:43:01,299
I loved you, Julia.

1110
01:43:02,091 --> 01:43:04,427
Julia is not here. Julia is dead.

1111
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:09,641
Laugh when I tell you that I still love you.

1112
01:43:10,224 --> 01:43:11,225
No.

1113
01:43:11,976 --> 01:43:13,436
No, not me.

1114
01:43:13,728 --> 01:43:15,021
You don't love me.

1115
01:43:15,313 --> 01:43:16,648
Yes.

1116
01:43:17,815 --> 01:43:19,651
Yes, you.

1117
01:43:20,985 --> 01:43:23,655
Not Julia Russell. Not...

1118
01:43:24,989 --> 01:43:26,491
...Bonny Castle.

1119
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:28,743
You.

1120
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:31,996
I love you as I know you.

1121
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:34,123
Because I know you.

1122
01:43:36,668 --> 01:43:38,002
As you are.

1123
01:43:40,004 --> 01:43:41,673
Good and bad.

1124
01:43:42,173 --> 01:43:43,925
Better and worse.

1125
01:43:47,428 --> 01:43:50,598
I told you this already,
but you didn't believe me.

1126
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:54,519
Tonight you will.

1127
01:43:56,771 --> 01:43:58,106
To us.

1128
01:44:00,566 --> 01:44:03,236
A short life and an exciting life.

1129
01:44:03,945 --> 01:44:05,613
Don't do this.

1130
01:44:06,781 --> 01:44:08,366
No other one.

1131
01:44:13,287 --> 01:44:15,456
No other love but you.

1132
01:44:19,961 --> 01:44:21,337
From first to last.

1133
01:44:24,132 --> 01:44:25,717
Start to finish.

1134
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:32,849
Don't change, Julia. Don't ever change.

1135
01:45:02,086 --> 01:45:03,921
Hold on.

1136
01:45:58,434 --> 01:45:59,769
Let's go.

1137
01:46:53,114 --> 01:46:54,615
You disappoint me, Bonny.

1138
01:46:59,787 --> 01:47:01,372
What do you think?

1139
01:47:01,456 --> 01:47:03,625
Do you think those are real bullets?

1140
01:47:22,769 --> 01:47:24,896
-Do you speak English?
-Yes!

1141
01:47:25,438 --> 01:47:26,814
He needs a doctor.

1142
01:47:26,939 --> 01:47:28,274
What about him?

1143
01:47:40,912 --> 01:47:43,247
He's dead. He needs a doctor.

1144
01:47:43,331 --> 01:47:46,250
All right. I'm calling the police.

1145
01:47:53,675 --> 01:47:56,177
Stay, stay.

1146
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:59,097
I love you.

1147
01:47:59,597 --> 01:48:02,600
I love you. Do you hear me?

1148
01:48:03,685 --> 01:48:08,606
-Say it. Say it again.
-I love you. I love you.

1149
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:10,858
I love you, Luis.

1150
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,409
You hold on! Hold on!

1151
01:48:21,369 --> 01:48:23,496
Don't go! Stay!

1152
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:25,707
Please hold on.

1153
01:48:44,767 --> 01:48:49,605
And this is where the story ends,
at least for me.

1154
01:48:52,108 --> 01:48:54,277
Even though he is alive now...

1155
01:48:54,902 --> 01:48:56,738
...how could I get to him?

1156
01:49:02,577 --> 01:49:04,412
Do you believe in forgiveness?

1157
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:07,874
Yes.

1158
01:49:07,957 --> 01:49:10,460
And redemption for the human soul?

1159
01:49:19,594 --> 01:49:20,762
Yes.

1160
01:49:21,304 --> 01:49:23,264
Even for someone like me?

1161
01:49:25,767 --> 01:49:26,934
Yes.

1162
01:49:28,227 --> 01:49:29,729
I believe so.

1163
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:33,941
I will see him in heaven, won't l?

1164
01:49:41,991 --> 01:49:43,284
Yes.

1165
01:49:46,954 --> 01:49:48,790
Will you hand me my shawl, please?

1166
01:49:48,873 --> 01:49:49,916
Yes, of course.

1167
01:49:57,256 --> 01:49:59,592
Now pray with me.

1168
01:50:00,218 --> 01:50:01,219
Yes.

1169
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:07,725
I wore this on my wedding day.

1170
01:50:09,018 --> 01:50:12,021
But my heart was not in it then.

1171
01:51:03,364 --> 01:51:06,034
I'm sorry, ma'am. It is time.

1172
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:18,921
If I may?

1173
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,718
What the hell!

1174
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:26,763
-It's the priest.
-But he left an hour ago.

1175
01:51:26,971 --> 01:51:28,181
I saw him.

1176
01:51:28,765 --> 01:51:31,100
Guards!

1177
01:52:07,553 --> 01:52:12,558
I must say, it is a pleasure to be in such
lovely company for a change.

1178
01:52:12,892 --> 01:52:15,061
The pleasure is all mine.

1179
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:18,398
Thank you, gentlemen,
for letting me attend.

1180
01:52:23,569 --> 01:52:27,824
And you, sir, may I say, it's a lucky man
who has found such a wife.

1181
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:32,245
Yes, I am.

1182
01:52:35,581 --> 01:52:38,042
Perhaps, later on...

1183
01:52:38,126 --> 01:52:41,045
...l will tell you the story
of how we came to be here.

1184
01:52:41,754 --> 01:52:45,341
It is an interesting tale.

1185
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:48,803
Some of it is even true.

1186
01:52:50,513 --> 01:52:52,849
But for now, all I can say...

1187
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:55,601
...is that from the moment I saw her...

1188
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:58,313
...l loved her.

1189
01:53:02,191 --> 01:53:04,360
And no matter the price...

1190
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:07,697
...you cannot walk away from love.

1191
01:53:11,826 --> 01:53:12,952
Four.

1192
01:53:13,305 --> 01:53:19,556
