00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,760
- Ease up. What's the matter with you?
- Just call it professional curiosity.

158
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,360
I just need to know
about these people.

159
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,640
And if there's something you think...

160
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,480
What does it matter what I think?
I'm just a driver.

161
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,680
But if you have your suspicions,
shouldn't you tell someone?

162
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,920
Who? The police?!

163
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,080
Cedric?

164
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,000
You back, babe?

165
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
Put down the knife.

166
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,600
We just wanna talk to ya.

167
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,600
Tell your husband to back away
from the Manning case.

168
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,000
Tell him yourself, you coward!

169
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,960
No! No!

170
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,480
Get off me! Get off me!

171
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,840
- No! Get off me!
- Give me the fucking knife!

172
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,880
Get off me!

173
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,000
I must point out the room has never
been used as an office by Manning.

174
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
But instead as a storage space

175
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,800
to house our client's extensive collection
of vintage model racing cars

176
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,760
numbering in excess to 1,400.

177
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,920
You getting in?

178
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,880
I've seen inside your room, sir.

179
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,920
Yeah? What did you see?

180
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,680
Would you like a cup of tea?

181
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,880
AK-47 s, Remingtons, Glocks, Sigs.

182
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
I'm guessing you were in the army.
You can't get that on the street

183
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,720
unless you're friendly with the Taliban.

184
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,200
I wanted to be in the army. They
wouldn't let me. Got a criminal record.

185
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,640
In the TA for a while.
Got kicked out of there.

186
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,360
Got a bit heavy with one of the NCOs.

187
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Fucking Black thought he was Rambo.

188
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,840
Came unstuck with me, though.

189
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,480
Here, talking about Blacks, guess what's
happened to an old barrister of mine.

190
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
No?

191
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,240
Someone's only gone and stabbed his
pregnant missus in the stomach.

192
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,000
Killed their baby. How sick's that?

193
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,720
People like us...
We wouldn't stand for it, would we?

194
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,640
I'd kill them with my bare hands.

195
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,480
What did you do?

196
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,080
Didn't do nothing. He was my barrister
years ago. Something about football.

197
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,760
- I just heard about it.
- No, I mean, what do you do?

198
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,240
Here?

199
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,200
Head of security. Good job. I like it.

200
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,280
Here, look, I wanna show you
something. You're a soldier.

201
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,360
You'll like this.

202
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,560
Rigged it all up myself.
No one else knows about it.

203
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,840
Both got a secret, you and me.

204
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
It's a dirty fucking world.

205
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,480
I've seen things happen in these rooms
you wouldn't have seen as a soldier.

206
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,040
Trust me.

207
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,160
You could stay here if you wanted.

208
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm married.

209
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm not a queer if that's what you think.
I just meant you could stay here.

210
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Use the camp bed
whilst you sort yourself out.

211
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,480
It's up to you.

212
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,400
What's the matter, mate?
You look really upset.

213
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,600
I pissed you off?

214
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,840
- No.
- Is it me? Have I pissed you off?

215
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,520
It's all right. I'll be fine. I just need
to get my head down, all right?

216
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,800
Maybe I'll see you soon, eh?

217
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,560
I could call your missus for you,
if you want.

218
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,920
Let her know where you are.

219
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,080
- 'Hello, Mardell speaking. '
- Sir. It's Bryant.

220
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,680
'Bryant. How are you? '

221
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
I need to see you, sir.

222
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,680
'OK, well, come over in the morning. '

223
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,640
Yes, sir.

224
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,040
Goodnight, soldier.

225
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,560
It's beautiful, sir.

226
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,080
Beats Kandahar.

227
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,400
Now, what's on your mind, Bryant?

228
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,400
Is everything OK at home?

229
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,120
Yeah.

230
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,120
Then why did you come here?

231
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,480
It's just... I don't know.
I don't see the point, sir.

232
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,520
You know? Being over there
and then coming home.

233
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,600
It's almost worse here.

234
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,800
You're a soldier. It's your job.
What do you want, sympathy?

235
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,960
No, but I wanna do something,
you know?

236
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,120
I don't wanna be
just another face in the crowd,

237
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,240
otherwise what was I doing out there?

238
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,720
I wanna... I wanna be remembered.

239
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,920
That'll be Sandy.

240
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,800
How is he, sir?

241
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,680
He never even
made it back to Cambridge.

242
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,040
Talk to him, Bryant.

243
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,480
He liked you.

244
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,120
What would you do to them
if you could find them, Sandy?

245
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,720
They go around wrecking lives.

246
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,160
And when they get caught, they get
a slap on the wrist. If it were me, I'd...

247
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,880
Help me.

248
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,000
Thanks, Sarge.

249
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,200
There was a man, Walter.

250
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,920
He followed me into the toilet and he
threatened me. Told me to walk away.

251
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,320
I can't prove it.

252
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,680
So it will never come to light.

253
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,560
And Manning was in the same room as
me when this happened to Marcia.

254
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,360
So how are we going to pin it on them?

255
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
We can't.

256
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,080
I mean, I should know. It's my job.

257
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,040
It was my wife.

258
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,640
They tried to kill my wife.

259
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,560
And they killed my baby.

260
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,960
Oh, God...

261
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,760
She's gonna pull through, Cedric.
She's gonna be all right.

262
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,920
Yeah.

263
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,360
Can I help you?

264
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,600
My name's Hillier.
You represented me a while back.

265
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,200
- How did you know where I live?
- I work in security, remember?

266
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,560
These are for your loss.

267
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,080
Thank you very much, Hillier.
That is... very kind of you.

268
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,280
Listen carefully. I know a man who can
help you with what's just happened.

269
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,160
You call us on this number if you want
to do something. It's up to you.

270
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,720
City boy.
Yeah, it is a long time no speak.

271
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,640
Really?

272
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,280
Come to the hotel tomorrow at 5:00.
Don't knock on the door.

273
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,360
OK.

274
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,560
That was the geezer
I went to school with. Complete nutter.

275
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,920
- He knows people.
- You're gonna get them done?

276
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,040
I'm gonna do something.

277
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,160
Oi, Dekker.
Have you thought about our little deal?

278
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,880
Dan, please. Look at the state of me.

279
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,080
You've got a week.
Otherwise you'll get ironed out again.

280
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,520
Right.

281
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,280
He'd be on the list as well.
You watch, Frank.

282
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,240
He'll get served.

283
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,520
They didn't fuck about with you,
did they?

284
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,360
That's why I'm here, Simon.

285
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,600
What do you need?

286
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,840
I dunno.

287
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,960
Yeah.

288
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,800
You know me, Gene.
I'll get whatever you want.

289
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,320
How much?

290
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,240
What are you doing?
Put it away. Don't work like that.

291
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,560
Put it away.

292
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,840
If you're gonna do anything,
don't do it on your own.

293
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,080
I know people.

294
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,960
Mate of mine.

295
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,680
Fucking hurt there.

296
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,120
Can I meet him?

297
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,920
Yeah.

298
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,880
But if I set it up,
I don't want you fucking about.

299
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,600
Hmm? Me and my mate,
we go to work properly, understand?

300
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,680
So what now?

301
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,480
- 'Hello? '
- How can you help me?

302
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,000
- 'Come to the hotel I work at, 3:00am. '
- Where is that?

303
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,040
- 'Look in your files. Under Hillier. '
- I'll be there.

304
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,280
Good. And don't knock on the door.

305
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,320
- 'How can you help me? '
- 'Come to the hotel I work at, 3:00am. '

306
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,560
'Where is that? '

307
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,560
What am I doing here?

308
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm a barrister, for Chrissakes.

309
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,720
You've got nowhere else to go.

310
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,240
I am really sorry.

311
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,960
I have to go. I can't do this.

312
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,840
- I am supposed to uphold the law.
- But the law's failed you.

313
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,520
Thank you for seeing me, Mr Bryant.

314
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,040
You know where I am now.

315
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,720
- When did you get down here?
- Day before yesterday.

316
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,720
Took Dad's car.

317
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,160
It's good you came.
You should be proud of yourself.

318
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,640
Proud I can drive? Look at me.

319
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,280
Think I'm having
a get-together this week.

320
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,240
Just a few like-minded people,
you know?

321
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,240
Should er... Should come along.

322
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,440
To do what?

323
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,480
Nothing special. Maybe a bit of keep fit.

324
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Good for you.

325
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,640
Even if you just say hello.

326
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,120
- I'm gonna go.
- No, stay, it's OK.

327
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,240
I don't wanna be like this all my life.

328
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm so sorry, Mr Monroe.

329
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,520
There's nothing more we could do.

330
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,160
Come in.

331
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,680
What are you doing here?

332
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,520
Eh?

333
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,800
I said what the fuck are you doing here?
Why have you come here?

334
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,200
To learn how to fight.

335
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Says who?

336
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,080
- Hillier said you'd teach us how to fight.
- I can't teach you how to fight.

337
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,120
Because you already can.

338
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,640
It's already in you.

339
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,600
- Where are you going, Monroe?
- I can't do this.

340
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
I...

341
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,560
Sorry to hear about your wife.

342
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,680
For fuck's sake, Monroe.

343
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,240
Think you wandered in here by mistake?

344
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,760
Deep down, you wanna stay,

345
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,640
because you've been abandoned
by the powers that be.

346
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,840
There's nowhere else to turn. Get
your shoes off and fall back in line.

347
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,400
Get AIDS,

348
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
or jump on a bus
with a rucksack full of explosives,

349
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,120
the government will dish you out
a free car,

350
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,040
but keep your head down,
be good and walk without a limp,

351
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
and you get zip.

352
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,800
That's why you're all here.

353
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,320
You count for nothing.

354
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,480
And your cries fall on deaf ears.
Same as me.

355
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,800
The only difference between us is
I've got the confidence to fight back.

356
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
So how do we fight back?

357
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,720
I don't know yet.

358
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,760
But if you want to spend your life getting
bullied and raped by cunts like Blair,

359
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,520
and having paedophiles
wander the fucking playgrounds

360
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,560
while you smile mutely
and pay your fucking taxes...

361
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,240
...then get out the door.

362
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,560
I wanna learn how to fight back.

363
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,480
So do I.

364
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,160
Me too.

365
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,160
Good.

366
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,040
No, you're wrong. You use
the inside of your hand, not your fist.

367
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,240
Smack 'em on the nose, sends the
nose bone straight up into the brain.

368
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,320
That will kill 'em instantly.
Reckon you could do it?

369
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,280
I'd rather let Bryant do it for me.

370
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,680
And that will save you
getting a 23 rec in prison.

371
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,200
How do you prefer to kill people, yeah?
Up close and personal, bare hands,

372
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,880
or sniper rifle, 300 yards, bingo?

373
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,360
I'd rather get you to do it for me.

374
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,800
I'd be happy to.

375
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,520
I'm going to the toilet.
Try not to kill anybody while I'm away.

376
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,040
What did I tell you, eh?
Fucking out-there.

377
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,560
- He's completely insane.
- Maybe. But he speaks sense.

378
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,440
Same again for everyone?

379
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
He's a fucking mug, huh?

380
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,640
If someone killed my family and I found
'em, I'd send 'em a fucking nail bomb.

381
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,440
No, it's a letter bomb.
That's what you'd send.

382
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,680
Excuse me.

383
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,200
Why don't you look where you're going,
you black cunt?

384
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Do yourself a favour and fuck off before
you get opened up like a tin of beans.

385
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,920
- What kind of fucking nutter are you?
- Fuck off.

386
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,960
- What happened?
- Nothing. Can we leave?

387
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,400
- What happened?
- I spilt the drinks. I'd like to leave.

388
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,160
- Who started on you?
- It was just some lads.

389
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,280
They called me a black 'C' and...
Could we just leave?

390
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,520
- Who was it?
- Doesn't matter.

391
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,400
Who is it? Eh?

392
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,400
It's the one with the dark hair
and blue T-shirt.

393
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,240
- You call my mate a black cunt?
- Who are you, you fucking mug?

394
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,600
- Wanna make one?
- I'll fucking make one!

395
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,800
- I'll fucking make one.
- Outside, all of you. Five minutes.

396
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,440
We'll fucking be there.
He's gonna go, this cunt.

397
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,520
We're gonna fight 'em.

398
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,920
- Excuse me?
- Come on, this is it.

399
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,120
For fuck's sake, Bryant. No way.

400
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,640
Come on, stand with me.
We can do this. Don't fall away.

401
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,040
This is it. We can do it!

402
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,880
I'm with you, boss.

403
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,360
Right, come on.

404
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,600
Come on.

405
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,880
Now we're talking bollocks.
Watch these smudges up here.

406
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,000
Come here.

407
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,480
- I'm going right through him.
- Come and stand over here.

408
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,400
Eh? Fucking stand with me.
Fucking stand with me.

409
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,200
You come here cos of them smudges.

410
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,160
Don't you fucking wanna...

411
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,600
Let's go. We're gonna get nicked.

412
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,640
Fucking saucy cunts.
Come on. Let's go.

413
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,400
What?

414
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,400
You fucking know what.

415
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,760
- I was shitting myself.
- So was I.

416
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,320
But at least I stood.

417
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,680
And Lord hold Marcia
underneath your wing.

418
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,040
Guide her with your loving hands

419
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,520
through the passages of heaven.

420
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,520
Amen.

421
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,160
Come here.

422
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,040
Are you religious?

423
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,280
I stopped believing
when I realised no one was listening.

424
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,280
Your lip's swollen.

425
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,240
I fell.

426
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,360
I've been listening to everything that's
happened over the past few days.

427
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,720
- That's illegal.
- So's what you've been doing.

428
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,400
- Where's Danny Bryant?
- How the hell should I know?

429
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,600
Well, find him and tell him
I wanna meet with him.

430
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,200
Otherwise I'll have you all nicked
for assault.

431
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,760
I thought you were different.

432
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,800
Do you mind if we talk alone?

433
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,720
Para?

434
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,760
I was Engineers. Where did you serve?

435
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,600
Falklands, Afghanistan, Iraq.
What the fuck does it matter?

436
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,480
If you wanna arrest me, get on with it.

437
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,720
Do you mind?

438
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,640
You know, two weeks ago,

439
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,760
some kids from our street...

440
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,960
They set fire to a 79-year-old woman

441
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,720
because she called the police.

442
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,440
After they tried to rob her, three times.

443
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,280
And do you know what the police said?

444
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,000
Paperwork.

445
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,840
I'm here to help you.

446
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,680
I heard what you said in the sports hall.

447
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,640
I wanna help ya.

448
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,480
I can get you sleeves on all Manning's
people, the ones that hurt Monroe.

449
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,440
The ones that killed his family.

450
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,880
The law failed him.

451
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,520
We won't.

452
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,600
You get that right and I'll
feed you paedophiles, dealers,

453
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:56,280
bullies, junkies, scum,
cunts, dogs... the lot.

454
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,000
And on top of that,

455
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,400
I'll try and keep you
one step ahead of the law.

456
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,400
Yeah?

457
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:16,000
This is my job. This is what they gave
me after serving 25 years on the force.

458
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:22,240
I get to drive high-risk
prosecution and collect CCTVs.

459
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,880
You wanna know why?

460
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,840
Because I play it by the fucking book.

461
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,880
You wanna hurt people like Manning,
get the people around him.

462
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,200
What about the people
that attacked Mardell?

463
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,320
You're on.

464
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,640
'Fuck you! You fucking fuck! '

465
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
We're one short tonight, gents.

466
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,400
Not everybody's got the appetite for it.
Glad to see you do.

467
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,080
Now.

468
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,720
I'm gonna walk out that door in a minute.
There is no training tonight.

469
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:26,280
The next time you see me, it'll only be if
you're serious about doing this properly.

470
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,560
About putting something of substance
together. Legitimate targets.

471
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,080
I'm talking about people that hurt you.
I'm talking about fucking violence.

472
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,880
So go home and make a decision.

473
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,640
You're either with me or you're not.

474
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,600
If you are,
I'll be at the hotel at midday tomorrow.

475
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,120
If you're not, forget you ever met me.

476
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,680
That's them.

477
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,320
Two IC1 s heading towards you.
Intercept and wait for me.

478
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,800
How are you, man?

479
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,080
Go on.

480
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,760
Go on.

481
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,480
Enough, Bryant.

482
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,440
Enough!

483
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,160
- Apple bag, please.
- Give me the money and then pick it up.

484
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,680
You work for Terry Manning, don't you?

485
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,360
So what if I fucking do?

486
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,360
- I have a message for him.
- What's that, then?

487
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,040
OK, go! Go! Come on, go!

488
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,560
Do you live round here?

489
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,360
Two drug dealers left for dead.

490
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,960
This is gang related. We've yet
to study the CCTV footage but...

491
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,080
Move along, just move along.

492
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,440
The investigation's ongoing
so I'd rather not comment further.

493
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,080
Sir, the caretaker called me up.
The monitors are on the blink.

494
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,760
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

495
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,760
And you'd know about that, would you?

496
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,480
You'll find that I did serve five years
in the Royal Engineers.

497
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,480
Indeed you did.

498
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,960
Shall I have another go, sir?

499
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,280
You do what you want, Lewis.

500
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,560
As long as you find out
who did this, huh?

501
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,160
Before you smile, watch this.

502
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,760
Camera 2 picked you all up
making your getaway.

503
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,640
Be careful. I may not be there next time.

504
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,640
Four cameras were watching.
We got two of 'em.

505
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,640
Fortunately, only one of them
matters this time. Now...

506
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,760
These are two more faces
on the Manning payroll.

507
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,560
Tomorrow, they transport laundered
drug money to a safe house.

508
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,160
Cos they had the police in their pocket,
there's no reason for 'em to suspect.

509
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,160
But be careful. Faces like this
don't go down like junkies.

510
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,880
- Isn't it robbery?
- Hit 'em quick and hard. They'll fold.

511
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,560
- What about police traffic?
- I can only do so much.

512
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,960
Give me your fucking keys, now.
Get down on the floor!

513
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,840
Down on the floor. You stay there.

514
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,760
You stay there. Come on!

515
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,880
Get down. Don't you move!

516
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,760
Get on the fucking corner!

517
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,680
- Stay there!
- Get down, you cunt!

518
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,240
Come on!

519
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,360
Keep down! Don't move!

520
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,560
Go, go! Get in! Fucking idiot!

521
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,960
Get in, you fucking idiot!

522
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,640
Fucking idiot! What did you do?

523
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,280
Me? That black bastard
pushed me out the way.

524
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,760
- Who you calling a black 'B'?
- You, you mug.

525
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,560
You pushed me out of the way.
You fucking mug!

526
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,880
Leave it! Leave it!

527
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,840
- We got something, didn't we?
- Not the point.

528
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,560
You're fucking useless, all of you.

529
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,160
Couldn't take money
when it's sitting on a plate.

530
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,760
I didn't know the police
were gonna be driving by.

531
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,360
Shut up. You're as bad as him.
Like fucking kids.

532
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,560
Extraordinary events
in a London suburb this morning.

533
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,480
What appeared to be a robbery

534
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,240
ended in thieves emptying sacks of cash
over the streets for the public.

535
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,360
'Extraordinary scenes indeed.

536
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,160
'Lt seems that the gang took the money
from known drug dealers

537
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:17,240
'slit open the bag and then let it go
from the back of their getaway van.

538
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,360
'Eyewitnesses reported that
the masked raiders waved at police

539
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,640
'as the money was distributed
into the streets. '

540
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,760
We're famous.

541
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,360
Someone's taking the piss, someone
under our roof. I've got too much to lose.

542
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,560
- Yes, sir. Clearly.
- Talk to the ghosts, see what they have.

543
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,560
Who are these fucking people?

544
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,040
Good afternoon.
We believe we have evidence

545
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,840
linking the robbery to the attempted
murders of the drug dealers this week.

546
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,840
We believe the same gang
is responsible for both crimes.

547
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,880
And we are treating this
as a priority case.

548
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:15,480
We also believe the gang have made
connections within the police force.

549
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,760
We will leave no stone unturned

550
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,760
in our attempts to bring police corruption
to justice.

551
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,960
'These gang members are nothing more
than mindless outlaws.

552
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,760
'And while certain members of the media

553
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,880
'will always find disillusioned members of
the public to lionise these street gangs,

554
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,960
'this footage shows the true horror
of what we are dealing with.

555
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,080
'The gang are armed.

556
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,560
'And the public should not approach them
under any circumstances.

557

by both the government and the police.

561

563

'Police criticised the media
for "hero worshipping" the armed gang

a "Robin Hood-style" organisation. '

as heroes or villains. '

568
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,480
Bullies. I put them top of my list,
you know?

569
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,960
I hate 'em.

570
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,840
There's a few that are gonna get served
one day.

571
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,160
Why stop there?
We can do what we want.

572
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,880
- Know where to draw the line.
- What line?

573
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,480
What are you gonna do? Punch every
traffic warden you come across?

574
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:56,560
No. I'm talking about your nonces and
that. Your Gary Glitters, your grasses.

575
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,680
Sickos, Muslims.
Hang the fucking lot of them.

576
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,760
Lan Huntley.
He'll be the first to fucking go.

577
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,160
I'm a Muslim, Hillier.
Do you want to kill me?

578
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,960
You ain't a Muslim. You're black.

579
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,560
So I'm not allowed to be a Muslim
because I'm black?

580
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,280
Here, boss. What was that thing
you said about suicide bombers?

581
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,160
You don't have to be a Muslim to blow
yourself up. I'm talking individuals.

582
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,160
- You gonna kill the Irish cos of the IRA?
- Yeah, I would.

583
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,760
You're such a Philistine
sometimes, Hillier.

584
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,160
No, I'm British 100%, me.

585
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,160
Listen. I'm here
because my wife and child are dead.

586
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,760
That has nothing to do with race
or religion.

587
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,360
OK?

588
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Get to a landline and call me back
on 02074960209.

589
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,680
- What's wrong?
- I think Greaves is on me.

590
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,560
Don't worry. This is swept.
Listen. I've found the CCTV

591
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,560
from the court toilets with Monroe.

592
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,760
'Your man's called Furlong. Lan Furlong.

593

'He currently resides in a bail hostel
in the West Country. '

594
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,040
Text me his address to Dekker's phone.
Why's he on bail?

595
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,360
Shoplifting crayons, apparently.

596
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:33,760
CPS document said he was originally
charged with sexually assaulting a minor.

597
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:38,360
But they buried it, down to his
cooperation with certain police officers.

598
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,240
The geezer's a fucking nonce.
Put him down.

599
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,680
You're a good man, Walter.
Thanks for everything.

600
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,760
Yeah. You too, son.

601
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,560
So where are you from?

602
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,360
You married?

603
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,560
I'm supposed to be getting married soon.

604
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,960
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I don't even know if I want to.

605
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,760
Stop talking.

606
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,440
There's the target. Bring the car round
and meet me on that corner.

607
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,360
Oi, Furlong.

608
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,960
Is it not true
that you work for Terry Manning?

609
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,880
And in a bid to bend a jury,

610
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,240
you murdered
the prosecution counsel's wife.

611
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,160
But you did threaten the counsel's
unborn child with murder

612
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,160
if he didn't walk away from the case,
did you not?

613
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,640
And lastly,
were you or were you not cleared

614
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,280
of sexually assaulting a minor

615
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:53,240
on the grounds of your special
relationships with certain police officers?

616
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:57,760
Guilty. Kick the barrel away
and let's get the fuck out of here.

617
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,960
For Christ's sake...

618
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,680
You have to stop this. This is murder.

619
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,840
What about your wife and kid?

620
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,080
- They're not the point.
- What is the point, then, Barrister?

621
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,280
If we do this, we become murderers.

622
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,280
And I don't want any part of that.
How do we know if he really did it?

623
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,560
Cos that's what we think?
Is that proof? Is it?

624
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,160
I do this for a living.

625
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,560
We need real proof.

626
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,440
Beyond a reasonable doubt.

627
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,480
This ain't murder. It's punishment.

628
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,360
Don't you do this.

629
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,760
Do it? That's what we're about.

630
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,640
This is who we are, now.

631
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,680
No!

632
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,560
Christ, you...

633
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,760
What did you fucking do that for? Eh?

634
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,080
You ain't seen the last of him.

635
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:09,760
I'm the boss, Hillier.
Don't you ever forget that.

636
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,160
Listen, it's worse than I thought.
Manning's got Greaves in his pocket.

637
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:57,240
They're doing all sorts together.
Manning will get bailed this week.

638
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,480
The case will collapse. Find him.
He's the one to go for next.

639
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,040
- What about Furlong?
- Fuck Furlong. He's already gone.

640
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,240
It wasn't that easy.

641
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,880
You let him go. For fuck's sake,
you don't know what you've done.

642
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,640
Hang up now.
Yeah, don't call this number again.

643
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,240
I'll contact you.

644
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,960
Furlong.

645
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,760
What you gonna do now... boss?

646
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,360
Fuck off.

647
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,480
Off you go, eh?

648
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,880
Better off without me, is that it?

649
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:08,960
Yeah, you carry on walking away
when things get tough.

650
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,680
Leave all the real work to me.

651
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,960
You're a joke.

652
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,040
Fucking outlaws?
What a load of old bollocks that is!

653
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:21,560
You ain't got it in ya. None of ya.

654
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,440
Not a fucking one of ya!

655
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,440
And all you do, boss, is give orders.

656
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,280
I've never seen you once back it up.

657
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,040
Not once.

658
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,640
No wonder your missus
started fucking about.

659
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,840
Who's coming? Who's staying?

660

- What for?
- Just get out.

They've killed Lewis

680

They don't know who you are.
You can still walk away.

- You should want to.

If they kill their own, you don't stand
a fucking chance. Now walk away.

Dump your phones and start again.

684

Forget we ever met. Don't make contact
with each other, whatever you do.

- Why?

689
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,040
I said go! Go on, fuck off!

690

For your own good. Go on.

691

This is where you were beaten up.
What do you wanna come here for?

Says they nearly had him.
Pinned him down somewhere in Essex

703

and he slipped the net again.

704

Do you think they'll catch him?

705
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,880
Did he kill anyone apart from Lewis?

706
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,240
He didn't kill Lewis.
Greaves and Manning did.

707

You know where Bryant is, don't ya?

708

Frank? Drop it.

709

You can make a lot of money with that
information. He's on the wanted list.

- I'm only asking.
- Where you been, shithead?

Therapy?

713
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,640
It's a shame you lot
never got round to him.

714
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,280
Bryant would have loved
to have dealt with him.

715
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:34,560
I would have come with you, but it would
have looked weird if we'd both gone.

Hey.

717
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,960
To the groom.

718
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:26,160
- What a fucking way to go out, eh?
- I can think of worse ways.

719
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,040
You know what you were saying
in the office about Manning?

720
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,440
You know my brother Andy?

721
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,560
He knows someone
who does a bit of running about for him.

722
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:43,760
- Said Manning's lying low in the country.
- Who the fuck have you been talked to?

723
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,760
- I told you earlier, friend. Drop it.
- I haven't spoken to anyone, I swear.

724
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:51,240
- It's just my brother.
- Where in the countryside?

725
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,160
Dunno. I can find out.

726
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,160
Leave me alone.

727

# It's gone #

733
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,480
- Manning made bail. Where is he?
- Kill me and you won't fucking know.

734
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:16,360
Somebody'll talk. They always do.

735
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,080
'He said Manning's lying low
in the country... '

736
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,360
I will.

737
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,760
'The only difference between us is

'I've got the confidence

739
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,280
Be faithful to her

740
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,560
No.

Yes? Yes?

742
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,040
There's a phone call for you, Cedric.

743
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,680
Who is it, Lucy?

744
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,480
He didn't give his name.
He said you'd know who it is.

745
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,360
How are you getting on?

746
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,680
I've been better.

747
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,680
You?

748
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,040
Do you wanna do something?

749
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,360
I know how to get to Manning.

750
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,880
Come on! Get him! Get him!

751
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,880
Come on, get back! Back!

752
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,880
What did I tell you?

753
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,640
- Put the gun down, please.
- What... did I tell you?

754
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,560
- You told us not to make contact.
- For your own good.

755
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,680
What were you talking about
at the restaurant with Monroe?

756
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,480
Somebody say something about
Manning? I heard you say Manning.

757
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,160
Tell me what you know, Dekker.

758
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:35,080
He's in the countryside. I know where.

759
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,960
- How do you know?
- I just do.

760
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,160
What were you planning?

761
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,160
We don't know what else to do
any more.

762
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,680
We'll dump the vehicle and go on foot.
A tree line runs into the garden.

763
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:52,840
The file says
he drives a black BMW 735i.

764
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,160
And that's our entry sign.

765
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,160
And once we're inside?

766
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,840
Any other questions?

767
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,040
It won't work. What do you think,
he's gonna be waiting for you alone?

768
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:14,040
Even if you do kill him, they'll find you.

769
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,560
You know where we'll be
if you change your mind.

770
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,880
What about you two?
You've still got lives to go back to.

771
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:42,040
You could slip under the radar,
forget we ever met.

772
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:44,960
He's probably right.

773
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,960
Chances are, we won't make it.

774
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,680
Come on.

775
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,040
Something's wrong.

776
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:19,760
Upstairs.

777
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:01,640
'Or spend the rest of your lives
getting raped by cunts like Blair?

778
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,560
'Or having paedophiles
wandering the fucking playgrounds

779
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:08,960
'while you smile mute
and pay your fucking taxes?

780
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,040
'Neither do I.

781
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,360
'I wanna learn how to... '

782
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,160
- Get down on the floor.
- Drop the weapons.

783
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:12,560
Go! Go!

784
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,640
Come on. Come on.

785
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,160
Over there. Come on.

786
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:12,760
It's all right. It's all right.
It's just a surface wound.

787
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,760
I'll live.

788
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,960
- What?
- What were you doing with that gun?

789
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,960
You were closer to hitting me than them.

790
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,960
What? I was the one
who shot the marksman, wasn't I?

791
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,960
Bollocks.
You didn't have your safety catch off.

792
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,960
- Rubbish.
- Rubbish, he says. Eh? Rubbish!

793
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,160
You know, Monroe? You know
something? I've never heard you swear.

794
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,760
Takes a lot of doing
for a man in your shoes.

795
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:03,480
If we go up that way, we're dead.

796
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,440
Make your targets!

797
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,840
Keep it sharp, lads!

798
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,360
Armed police! Stand still!

799
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,360
Get the murdering little fucker! Stop him!

800
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,560
Do it! Kill him!

801
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,480
Shit.

802
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,280
Thanks, Mr Manning.

803
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,640
You ain't got the bollocks, son.

804
01:35:42,305 --> 01:35:48,191
