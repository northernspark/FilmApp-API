It's a long way to St. Louis.

- The child's only known relative.
- That so?

65
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,792
You're driving your chariot to Missouri, sir.
You could deliver this child to her kin folk.

Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a chariot, Reverend.

- I'll write the women a letter tonight.
- Hold it, hold it.

I have to think upon this,
you know, uh...

69
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,969
I mean, I may have to make
a few stops along the way.

70
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,762
I never travelled with no child before.

71
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,182
- But you're going that way.
- The child's got no place to go.

- I'd like a minute of your time.

00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,340
- Not buying today.
- Oh, not selling.

- Addie what, honey?
- Addie Loggins.

You done real fine.
I'll be out in a minute.

Ain't she a sweet child?

96
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,982
No, she ain't a sweet child.

97
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,693
Well, maybe she don't seem sweet right now.
That's because she's sad.

What are you trying to pull?
Get out of here!

101
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,494
All right, I'm going, but let me tell you
where I'm going to go.

I don't care where you're going to go.

I'm going to go see Mr J.T. Faraday.

Now, you know who Mr J.T. Faraday is?

He's one of the biggest lawyers
in Kansas.

106
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,796
And he don't favour the man with the money,
he favours the man without it.

107
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,840
And you know what's gonna happen
to your brother?

108
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,342
There's gonna be a lawsuit against him.
You know what happens then?

109
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,053
Everything's gonna be just tied up
in knots, just sitting there.

110
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,765
That's his banking money,
his house, everything he owns.

Including half this plant.

Now, don't think that poor child
ain't entitled, 'cause she is.

00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,900
I was thinking...

114
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,735
couple a thousand dollars
would be acceptable.

115
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,737
Couple of thou? I'll give you 200.

116
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,199
$200?

117
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,325
$200.

118
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,204
It's a deal.

119
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,624
There you are.

120
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,765
That'll be, uh, $67.54.

121
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,350
You sure these tyres are new?

122
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,437
$67.54.

123
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,158
Now, we'll have you
to St. Jo in no time.

00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,328
What time's the next train
to St. Joseph?

125
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,872
St. Joseph? Let's see here.

126
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,790
That'll be the 4:14.

127
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,586
Change trains in Kansas City,
and that'll put you into St. Jo at 9:52am.

00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,921
I want one child's price ticket.

129
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,470
That will be $11.45.

130
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,097
I want you to send this here telegram
to Mrs Billie Roy Griggs,

133
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,145
and bringing love,
affection and $20 cash.

134
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,065
Oh, make that $25 cash.

135
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,484
And sign it just Addie Loggins.

136
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,321
Ten words, that will be 85 cents more.

137
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,949
That will be 12 and 30.

138
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,617
12 and 30, huh?

139
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,869
Uh, you better say
in that message there,

140
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,163
love, affection and $20 cash.

141
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,333
Love, affection and $20 cash.

142
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,140
Now, here's your ticket,
and here's $20 for your Aunt Billie.

143
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,105
Well, we got till 4:15.

144
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,525
I don't suppose you can wait
here by yourself, can you?

145
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,781
You hungry?

146
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,616
You want a Nehi and a Coney Island?

147
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,939
- Ain't you gonna eat it?
- I ain't hungry.

148
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,192
D'you worry about going on the train?
You'll like the train. Don't worry about it.

149
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,195
Before you know it, you'll be asleep in your
aunt's house, all your troubles will be over.

150
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,615
- So eat your Coney Island.
- She don't even know me.

151
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,700
- She's going to know you now.
- She ain't gonna want me.

152
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,952
What are you making trouble for?
She ain't even seen you, yet.

153
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,872
- She never even cared for my mama.
- Nobody didn't care for your mama.

154
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,583
- And she was her sister.
- Your mama was a fine woman.

155
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,834
Everybody said she weren't.

156
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,211
Well everybody don't know
your mama, do they?

157
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,464
How good you know my mama?

158
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,550
Good enough to know you can be real proud
of the happiness she give to people.

159
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,385
Now, eat your Coney Island.

160
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,140
You meet my mama in a bar room?

161
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,933
Where would you get
a question like that?

162
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,312
I hear Miss Ollie talking, the neighbour
lady. Says one of you's my pa.

163
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,023
Well, don't the world
have a wild imagination?

164
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,361
Eat your Coney Island.

165
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,488
You my pa?

166
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,783
Of course I ain't your pa.

167
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,534
I'll get you some relish.

168
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,330
A Coney Island ain't no good
without relish.

169
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,709
Look, I know how you feel.
I lost my ma, too. I even lost my pa.

170
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,961
I don't even know where my sister is.

171
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,632
I wish I could tell you I'm your pa,
but it just ain't like that.

172
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,761
You met her in a bar room.

173
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,889
Just because a man meets a woman
in a bar room don't mean he's your pa.

174
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,974
Eat your Coney Island.

175
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,107
Well, then, if you ain't my pa,
I want my $200.

176
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,983
What's that?

177
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,611
I want my $200.

178
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,738
I heard you through the door
talking to that man.

179
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,782
It's my money you got, and I want it.

180
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,034
Now, you... you just hold on a second.

181
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,954
I want my money. You took my $200!

182
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,832
- Will you quiet down, you hear?
- I want my $200!

183
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,209
Hold on, now, just hold on.

184
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,711
Let me explain something to you.

185
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,879
It ain't as if you was my pa.
That'd be different.

186
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,965
Well, I ain't your pa,
so just get that out of your head.

187
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,717
I don't care
what those neighbour ladies said.

188
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,176
- I look like that.
- You don't look nothing like me.

189
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,595
You don't look any more like me
than you do that Coney Island.

190
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,013
Eat that damn thing, you hear?

191
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,725
- We got the same jaw.
- Lots of people got the same jaw.

192
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,185
- It's possible.
- No, no, it ain't possible.

193
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,771
- Then I want my $200!
- All right!

194
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,024
All right, maybe we got the same jaw,
but same jaw don't mean same blood.

195
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,694
I know a woman looks like a bullfrog,
but that don't mean she's its mother.

196
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,239
- You met my mum in a bar room.
- For God's sakes, child!

197
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,366
You think everybody gets met
in a bar room gets a baby?

198
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,659
It's possible.

199
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,496
Anything is possible,
but possible don't make it true.

200
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,749
Then I want my money!

201
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,042
Will you quiet down?

202
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,839
You know what the trouble is with you?
You got no appreciation.

203
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,340
All right.

204
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,343
Maybe I did get a little money from that man,
and you're entitled to that,

205
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,138
but I'm entitled to my share
for getting it for you, ain't I?

206
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,098
And where do you think
you'd be without me?

207
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,477
You think them folks would spend a penny
to send you east? No, sir.

208
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,688
But who got you a ticket to St. Jo?
Who got you a Nehi and a Coney Island?

209
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,440
And threw in $20 extra,

210
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,901
not to mention 85 cents
for that telegram.

211
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,361
You wouldn't have had
any of that without me.

212
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,864
Now, I didn't have to take you,
but I took you, didn't I?

213
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,408
All right, I think that's fair enough.

214
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,786
We're both a little better off.

215
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,622
You get to St. Jo,
I get myself a little better car.

216
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,791
Fair is fair.

217
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,170
Now, drink your Nehi,
and eat your Coney Island.

218
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,383
I want my $200.

219
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,639
I don't have your $200 no more,
and you know it.

220
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,769
If you don't give me my $200,
I'm going to tell a policeman how you got it,

221
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,355
and he'll make you give it to me,
'cause it's mine.

222
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,567
But I don't have it.

223
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,654
Then get it.

224
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,535
How we doing, Angel Pie?

225
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,538
We going to have a little dessert
when we finish up our hot dog?

226
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,248
I don't know.

227
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,541
What do you say, Daddy?

228
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,919
Why don't we get Precious
a little dessert if she eats her dog?

229
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,464
Her name ain't Precious.

230
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,803
I want my money back on this here ticket,
and I want you to send this here telegram.

231
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,848
Trip delayed, but I'm coming real soon!

232
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,214
You just lie down in the seat
and be quiet.

233
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,009
Folks don't take to children
when they're doing business.

- Good afternoon, ma'am.

236
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,422
- Is Mr Rudolf Morgan at home, please?
- Mr Morgan?

237
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,717
Yes, ma'am. My name is Pray, Moses Pray,

239
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,639
Oh, I'm sorry. Mr Morgan has passed on.

240
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,183
Oh, ma'am, I'm... I just...

241
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,392
I don't know what to say.

242
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,353
Uh, what was it you
were seeing him about?

243
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,563
- Well, he ordered this here bible from...
- Bible?

244
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,106
Rudolph ordered a bible?

245
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,442
Yeah, he ordered this here deluxe edition
with the lady's name in the corner.

246
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,027
Lady's name?

247
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,696
Oh, I expect some special gift
for a family friend.

248
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,989
But under the circumstances,

249
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,241
I'll just give you back
Mr Morgan's dollar deposit,

250
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,285
and there won't be
no further obligation.

251
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,830
Ma'am, I just don't know how to put
into words the sense of sorrow that I feel.

252
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,833
What, what...
what name is in the corner?

253
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,213
I don't really know what name
Mr Morgan had put in the corner, ma'am.

254
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,422
Let's see, now.

255
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,841
It's here somewhere. I've got it. Uh...

256
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,134
Here it is.

257
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,844
- Pearl...
- MOZE: Pearl.

258
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,262
I'm Pearl.

259
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,641
Well, he must have got
this here good book for you, ma'am.

260
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,018
Yes. Yes, he bought it for me.

261
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,270
Of course, now,
you're not obliged to take it.

262
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,897
Of course I'll take it.

263
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,732
There's just one thing. You see, I...

264
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,859
I told him that I could sell him
a cheaper bible,

265
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,822
but no, naturally he wanted the best,
the best, of course, being the deluxe edition

266
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,324
with the lady's name printed
in child-in-the-manger gold letters.

267
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,742
Oh, he would.

268
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,829
Bringing a balance due of, uh...
$8.00? $8.00.

269
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,372
$8.00?

270
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,417
Well, that's, uh, $8.00
minus the dollar deposit,

271
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,335
making it $7.00.

272
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,837
Um, I'll go get my purse.

273
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,840
- Well, you're not obliged to take it, now.
- Of course I'm obliged!

Better than I've felt in a long time.

305
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,155
Bet old Frank sure does wish he was 21.

306
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,577
You don't like me, do you?

307
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,581
No, I don't like you.

308
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,797
WOMAN: Yes?

309
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,717
Afternoon, ma'am. I was wondering
if Mr Bates might be at home.

310
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,845
Mr Bates is dead.
He died over a week ago.

311
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,430
Oh, you mean he passed over, ma'am?

312
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,057
Why, I was just talking to him
not less than a month ago.

313
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,809
- What was it you wanted?
- Well...

314
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,312
My name is Pray, Kansas Bible Company.

315
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,439
I'm just here to deliver this bible
that Mr Bates ordered.

316
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,690
Bible?

317
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,650
Who is it? What's the trouble?

318
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,154
Something about Benjamin buying a bible.

319
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,114
Bible? What kind of bible?

320
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,117
He said he talked to Benjamin,
less than a month ago.

321
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,870
Well, I'm... I'm not exactly sure
of the dates, ma'am.

322
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,830
Well, I don't see how.

323
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,459
Benjamin didn't go nowheres near that shop
for more than a month before he died.

324
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,253
Well, I may be a little
mixed up on the dates.

325
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,422
What company you say you're from?

326
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,799
The Kansas Bible Company,
out of Wichita.

327
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,509
Kansas Bible Company?

328
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,553
I ain't never heard of
no Kansas Bible Company.

329
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,888
Daddy...

330
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,808
Can't we go now? I want to get to church
and pray for Mama.

331
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,271
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure we can, honey.

332
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,023
Daddy was just fixin' to leave.

333
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,943
This here is my little girl.
It's just the two of us now.

334
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,987
- My Mama's gone to the Lord.
- Oh, so has poor Mr Bates, honey.

335
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,073
I'll just, uh, give you back
his dollar deposit,

336
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,533
and you let us know if
there's anything we can do.

337
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,411
Hold on, there. Wait one damn minute.

338
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,707
He actually done ordered a bible, huh?

339
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,877
Uh, he sure did. Here it is, right here
in gold for somebody named "Marie".

340
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,881
- That's her. She's Marie.
- Oh, she sure did mean a lot to him.

341
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,425
He especially had me get
the deluxe edition.

342
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,552
- How much to keep this here book?
- Oh, well, that one is the...

343
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,096
It's the $12 one, Daddy.

344
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,931
- $12?
- $12?

345
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,475
Uh, yeah, well, honey, we have
to have a little goodness in our hearts,

346
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,061
- I mean, considering the circumstances.
- Never mind the circumstances.

347
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,815
And if it'll make that woman happy,
I'll take it.

Now he's going to say how he's got to
straighten the closet out!

How'd you like to do

You mean instead of paying me back?

362
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,712
Now, don't get nervous. I'll pay you back.
I'm just saying, while we're heading east,

363
00:21:57,812 --> 00:22:00,005
how'd you like to do a little business
together, that's all?

364
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,135
Well, you're looking at me
like I'm out to cheat you or something.

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,512
I am offering you a business proposition.
Take it or leave it.

And turn off that radio! You're like
to drive us all deaf with that radio.

RADIO:
'...in an average way, of course.'

368
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,695
OK, I want you to remember one thing:

369
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,238
I decide on the price.

370
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,367
Maybe you don't know French, but there's
something in this world called "fine-esse".

371
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,452
$12! I never sold no bible for $12.

372
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,704
That man was a law officer.
You could've had me put me in jail.

373
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,623
We got it, didn't we?

374
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,293
I don't care if we got it.
Don't you go making the decisions.

375
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,464
I make the decisions. All you got
to do is look like a pretty little girl.

376
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,514
You ain't got something like a ribbon
in that cigar box, do you?

377
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,518
I got my mum's kimono in my suitcase,
Chinamen with umbrellas.

378
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,105
That ain't quite what I had in mind.

379
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,282
You look real nice in that ribbon.

380
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,701
First off, I didn't know
was she a boy or a girl?

381
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,161
I'm a girl.

382
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,831
Well, it makes all the difference.

383
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,875
Ain't she got a sweet
little face, somehow.

384
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,795
Well, seeing how I just got paid today,
we'll take a ribbon in each colour.

385
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,171
How much that going to set me back?

386
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,340
Well, that'll be 15 cents.

387
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,136
Bought my grandchildren
ribbons just like this last holiday time.

388
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,555
Grandchildren? I don't believe it.

389
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,474
- You break a five?
- Well, you can believe it, all right.

390
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,726
I'm just as old as I look.

391
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,937
Well, now, here you be.

392
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,316
That's one, two, three, four, five.

393
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,402
This old wallet of mine
is about to bust its sides.

394
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,988
I'll give you five ones back,
you give me that $5 bill.

395
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,656
How many grandchildren
you got altogether?

396
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,326
Well, I got two little granddaughters,
a nine-year-old, a ten-year-old,

397
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,996
two grandsons near 16,

398
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,874
and I got a grandson 35 years old.

399
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,792
Come on, you're pulling my leg.

400
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,504
Why don't you just give me a $10 bill?
Here's the $5, and five ones, there.

401
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,339
That way I won't be so quick
to see it break apart.

402
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,135
- Six children, huh? My, my, my...
- I've got a daughter, 51.

403
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,137
Oh, now, I don't mean
to be handing you no line,

404
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,265
but that's just pretty hard to believe
you got a 51-year-old child.

405
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,559
(LAUGHS) You can believe it, all right.

406
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,979
Well, I'm afraid I'd have to see it
to believe it. Much obliged.

407
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,483
- See you again.
- Y'all come back!

408
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:42,501
That just don't seem quite right...
somehow.

409
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,216
(DOOR OPENS) Yes?

410
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,343
I'm looking for Mr Stanley, ma'am.

411
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,886
Mr Stanley's dead.

412
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,056
Oh, well, I'm looking for
Mr Warren M. Stanley, ma'am.

413
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,141
Warren's passed on, sir.

414
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,392
Oh, that's hard to believe.

415
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,728
I was just talking to Warren
not more than two weeks back.

416
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,563
He ordered this here bible from me.

417
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,941
Warren spent money on a bible?

418
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,401
Yes, ma'am, with the name Elvira
in the corner.

419
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,946
Why would Warren spend money on a bible?

420
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,948
He took fast to the idea, ma'am.

421
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,908
Only thing is, he left a balance due of,

422
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,952
well, let's see,
not counting the dollar deposit...

423
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,454
Daddy, this one's already paid for.

424
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,580
Huh?

425
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,959
Mr Stanley paid for the whole thing,
don't you remember?

426
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,933
Afternoon, ma'am. Mr Huff at home?

427
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,769
Mr Huff passed away,
young man, a week ago.

428
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,814
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I was just talking to
Mr Huff not more than a month ago.

429
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,190
What was it you wanted?

430
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,527
Oh, well, my name is Pray,
Kansas Bible Company.

431
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,113
Mr Huff ordered this bible
as a gift for someone named Edna.

432
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,115
Oh, that's my name.

433
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,472
You don't have to take it
if you don't want to.

434
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,929
I'll just give you back
Amos's dollar deposit and then...

435
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,371
Of course I want to keep it.

436
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,207
He bought me a bible.

437
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,501
Yes, ma'am. Now, I told Amos
I could sell him a cheaper one,

438
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,753
but no, naturally, he wanted the best,

439
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,131
the best, of course,
being the deluxe edition

440
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,466
with the name printed
in child-in-the-manger gold letters,

441
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,177
- bringing up a balance due of...
- ...of $24!

442
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,555
$24. I'll get my purse.

443
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,307
What's your name, honey?

444
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,435
- Addie.
- Addie. What a sweet little name.

445
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,686
Addie Pray, ma'am.

446
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,189
Well, Addie Pray,
I'm going to give you $24,

447
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,818
and an extra $5
for just coming to my door.

448
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,654
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,813
- Moze, let's give him some money.
- No.

453
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:12,359
Just a little bit. We got $305.16.

454
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,319
Whole 'nother business giving it away.

455
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,863
- It's bad enough you give away bibles.
- But they're poorly.

456
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,740
The whole country's poorly,
I told you before.

457
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,034
But Frank D. Roosevelt says
we got to look out for one another.

458
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,577
I don't care about Frank D. Roosevelt.

459
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,204
- But he says it.
- That so?

460
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,123
Why don't you ask Frank D. Roosevelt
what he thinks about taking care of himself?

461
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,625
You think he don't eat off silver trays?

462
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,503
He could eat off table tops like the rest
of us, but he don't. You know why?

463
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,421
Because that would make him look common.

464
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,091
And besides, Frank D. Roosevelt
ain't running this thing - I'm running it!

465
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,343
So don't you make up no rules
about what we're going to give away.

466
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,845
It's my money too, you know.
$200 belong to me,

467
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,472
- and don't you forget that.
- You want it?

468
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,100
Well, just put my share in my pocket,
and I'll take you to a train station.

469
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,143
How do you like that?

470
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,314
Get the map.
Find out where the nearest depot is.

471
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,857
Nothing but trouble, anyway.

472
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,818
First you charge too much,
then you want to give it away.

473
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,153
- Where are we now?
- We just left Plainville.

474
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,239
$12 for a bible, then it's up to $24.

475
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,616
If I stay with you,
I'll spend the rest of my life in jail.

476
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,035
There's a depot in Lincoln.
You can take me to Lincoln.

477
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,245
You bet I will!

478
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,871
- Where's Lincoln?
- Clear over there.

479
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,915
Oh, boy, you think
I'm going to take you clear over there

480
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,208
just to get you to some depot?

481
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,168
Then keep going east.
We'll hit one in Sylvan Grove.

482
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,879
- Where's Sylvan Grove?
- Right here.

483
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,464
Well, that'll take us
down through Lucas.

484
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,383
We got to go through something
to get to Sylvan Grove.

485
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,760
I'm not complaining. I'm just saying
that'll take you through Lucas.

486
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,388
You got to go through Paradox and Waldo
and Lorraine and Lucas

487
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,848
if you want to get to Sylvan Grove.

488
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,058
Those are pretty good towns in there.
We could do some business in there.

489
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,352
Well, it won't matter much.
We're near out of bibles anyway.

490
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,105
What do you mean, we're out of bibles?
Why didn't you tell me we're out of bibles?

491
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,565
You look in the box too, don't you?

492
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,317
- Well, you've got an excuse for everything.
- 'Cause you blame me for everything.

493
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,778
If we were running out of bibles,
you should have told me.

494
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,114
- We're running out of bibles!
- Well, then we got to get new ones!

495
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,658
- Then let's get new ones!
- We can pick some up in Great Bend.

496
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:47,412
- Great Bend's the other way.
- Well, we gotta have bibles, don't we?

497
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,790
Let's see, now, we can veer down to Lucas,
and we'll veer over to Wilson.

498
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,917
Veer off to Lorraine and Bushton.

499
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,503
And we could veer off to Hoisington.

500
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,798
We'll just have to keep on veering,
that's all.

501
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,345

- Uh-huh.

All right, boy, you're next.

He did not.
He looked me straight in the eye.

Yeah, well, I'm looking you straight

- Oh, you're just saying that.
- Would I make that up?

You're as beautiful as your mama, and she

00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,670
You know, they wouldn't even let her come
to Holland for fear she'd droop the tulips,

536
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,630
and you got all the good looks
she ever had.

537
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,674
Then how come that man called me a boy?

538
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,676
I don't know, maybe it's...

539
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,928
Maybe it's 'cause of what you got on,
or something.

What's wrong with what I got on?

541
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,934
Oh, nothing wrong with it, just...
don't exactly make you look feminine.

542
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,063
Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea
we get you fixed up a little bit,

543
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,149
get you a new dress,
a fancy new hat, or something.

544
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,319
Come to think of it,
it wouldn't exactly hurt business, either.

- Come on.
- Where are we going?

Thank you very much. I don't need a bag.

- Thank you. Bye now.

Hello. How much is this?

564
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,091
That'll be 35 cents.

565
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,468
65 cents makes a dollar.
Thank you very much.

566
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,761
Thank you.

567
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,096

That'll be 25 cents.

There you go.

571
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,413
Lady, you made a mistake.

572
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,624
Huh? I give you $4.75.

573
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,626
But I gave you a $20 bill.

574
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,628
Uh-uh. You give me a $5.

575
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,922
No, ma'am, it was a $20 bill.

576
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,218
You give me a $5, and I give you $4.75.

577
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,514
It was a $20 bill.

578
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,061

and I give her change.

00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,235
I gave her a $20 bill - I know I did.

582
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,197
It was a birthday present
from my Aunt Helen in Wichita,

583
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,490
and she wrote "Happy Birthday, Addie"
on the end of it.

584
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,659
You just go look and see.

That's it right there!

from my Aunt Helen in Wichita.

- I'm giving it.

- Yes, sir.

589
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,174
- And give her a piece of candy.
- Yes, sir.

590
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,844
- And pay attention to things, Miss Brownwell.
- Yes, sir.

594
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,069
There you are, little girl.

595
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,904

596
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,240
Mister, this purse is sure full.

597
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,200

I'll give you five ones.

Would you give me a ten dollar bill?

- How many times you going to see it?

Now why don't you go play bingo

I don't want to play bingo.

- Come on, now.
- I ain't ready.

753
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,357
Well, you don't look real busy with nothing,
so you just come on down.

754
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,984
I ain't coming.

755
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,070
- Now you listen here, child.
- No, I won't listen here.

756
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,405
What the heck's up with you, then?

757
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,490
I want to sit in front.

758
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,534
And how come we ain't working no more?

759
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,036
'Cause we're on vacation, that's why.

760
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:31,415
And Miss Delight and me are sitting in front
because we are two grown-ups,

761
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,667
and that's where grown-ups
do the sitting.

762
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,502
And little children
do not tell grown-ups

763
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,337
what to do with their lives,
you understand that?

764
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,383
Well, she ain't my grown-up, and I ain't
planning no more to sit in the back.

765
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,718
Not for no cow.

766
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,344
Will you keep your voice down?

767
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,889
And Miss Delight ain't no cow.
She's a proper woman.

768
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,432
She has a high school diploma,

769
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,769
and right now she's gotta go to the bathroom,
so you just get on down to the car.

770
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,812
She always has to go to the bathroom.

771
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,356
She must have a bladder
the size of a peanut.

772
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,610
Well, I ain't getting back in that car.
Not till she gets out of it.

773
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,647
Hey, what's up, kiddo?
Daddy says you're wearing a sad face.

774
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,315
Ain't good to have a sad face.

775
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,276
Hey, how would you like a colouring book?
Would you like that?

776
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,861
You like Mickey the Mouse?

777
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,780
Oh, son of a bitch!

778
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,783
Ooh... oh.

779
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,162
Now come on down to the car
and let's all be friends.

780
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,040
You see me smile? Come on,
let's see you smile like Aunt Trixie.

781
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,250
Now, come on!

782
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,710
Come on down to the car
with mademoiselle.

783
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,134
Kiddo, I understand how you feel.

784
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,136
Well, you don't have to worry.

785
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,056
One of these days, you're going to be
just as pretty as mademoiselle,

786
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,933
maybe prettier.

787
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,060
You already got bone structure.

788
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,563
When I was your age,
I didn't have no bone structure.

789
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,606
Took me years to get bone structure.

790
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,442
And don't think bone structure's
not important.

791
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,112
Nobody started to call me mademoiselle
till I was 17

792
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,614
and getting a little bone structure.

793
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,867
When I was your age,
I was skinnier than a pole.

794
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,035
I never thought
I'd have nothing up here.

795
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,538
You're going to have them up there, too.

796
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,917
Look, I'll tell you what.
Want me to show you how to use cosmetics?

797
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,964
Look, I'll let you put on my earrings.
You can see how pretty you're going to be.

798
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,092
And I'll show you how to
make up your eyes.

799
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,886
And your lips.

800
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,263
And I'll see to it you get
a little bra or something.

801
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,849
But right now you're gonna
pick your little ass up,

802
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,184
you're gonna drop it in the backseat
and you're gonna cut out the crap,

803
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,769
you understand?

804
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,117
You're going to ruin it, ain't you?

805
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,495
Look, I don't want to wipe you out,

806
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,248
and I don't want you
wiping me out, you know?

807
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,459
So, I'm going to level with you, OK?

808
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,087
Now, you see, with me,
it's just a matter of time.

809
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,926
I don't know why, but somehow
I just don't manage to hold on real long.

810
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,846
So, if you wait it out a little,
it'll be over, you know?

811
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,266
I mean, even if I want a fella,

812
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:39,478
somehow or other
I manage to get it screwed up.

813
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,816
Maybe I'll get a new pair of shoes,
nice dress, a few laughs.

814
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,611
Times are hard.

815
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,531
Now, if you fool around
on the hill up here,

816
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,158
then you don't get nothing,

817
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,618
I don't get nothing,

818

he don't get nothing.

819
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,374
So how 'bout it, honey?

820
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,542
Just for a little while,

going to wet her pantaloons.

Oh, my, I almost fell down.

Yoo-hoo! Look what we got!

Now, come on, Imogene.
Now, get everything in here.

We got more room than
the whole state of Kansas.

This girl's sitting on the trolley,
and she reaches in her bag,

843
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,120
and she takes out this magazine,
and she starts to read it.

844
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,830
Well, she ain't read more than
a couple of pages.

845
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,083
And real slow and careful now,
she takes her stockings down

and takes off her shoes.

Now, she turns the stockings wrong side out,
and she puts them back on.

848

She puts her shoes back on.

00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,157
- in the middle of the road.
- That's what I figured.

904
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,367
What you got in mind?

905
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,869
You want to get away
from Miss Trixie, don't you?

906
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,872
Well, if you help me, I'll give you
enough money to get home to your mama.

907
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,458
- How much money?
- $30.

908
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,877
- When do we start?
- Tomorrow morning.

909

Miss Trixie,

910
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:04,636
you know that man down at the desk
who checked us in yesterday?

911
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,346
Yeah, I know him. What about him?

912
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,058
Well, he tell me, he'd pay $25
just to have a good time with you.

913
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,309
What?

914
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,853
Well, that little two-bit bum
nerve of that guy.

915
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,773
$25. I bet that little John
don't make that much in a week.

916
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,191
Where would he get 25 bucks?

917
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,278
I don't know.
All I know is what he told me.

918
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,989
25 bucks, huh?

919
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,782
Sure have to see the money
to believe it.

920

Here you go. You come back
and see us again real soon.

Want I should chew it for you?

that comes down here
named Miss Trixie Delight?

Well, she thinks you're real cute.

926
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,564
Oh, yeah? Says you and who else?

927
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,442
No, honest. She says you're better looking
than Dick Powell.

928
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,111
She did, eh?
Well, the lady's got good taste, don't she?

929
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,947
- Well, just thought you'd like to know.
- Hey, just a minute.

930
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:11,953
Give these here to the lady, and tell her
they're with Floyd's compliments.

931
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,790
Oh. She'll like that.

932
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,584
Maybe you should write her a note.

933
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,086
- Yeah. What kind of a note?
- Oh, I don't know.

934
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,506
I thought men always wrote ladies notes
when they send them presents.

935
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,425
Maybe you should ask her for a date.

936
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,093
That will sure tickle her.

937
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,928
Yeah. Maybe I ought to.

938
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,140
Say, she's not married up
or anything like that, is she?

939
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,728
Of course not. She don't even have
a regular boyfriend.

940
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,689
That man who come in here
yesterday with her is my daddy.

941
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,858
He's her manager. She's a dancer.

942
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,276
A dancer?

943
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,653
You know, I figured
she was something like that.

Well, how about that!

Why don't you print it?
She like men who prints.

Oh. What do you want?

He asked me to tell you he had
to run over to Hainesville today.

I think he had to get something
fixed on his car.

- He'll be gone all day.
- Oh.

Well... OK.

- What you having?
- Waffles.

They ain't bad for waffles.

Mr Moze, Miss Trixie don't feel so good.

She say she's going
to stay in bed today.

- It was outside the door.

tonight... when the moon is full.

she won't even be here after today.

01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,428
I'm talkin' about $625.

1207
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,013
Now, just where might that be?

1208
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,266
I don't have no $625.
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

1209
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:21,310
I don't even know where the old barn is.

1210
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,188
Well...

1211
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:28,775
I reckon we'll just have to explain
a little more thoroughly, won't we?

1212
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,320
Come on, Beau, you take a ride
with these nice people.

1213
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,822
- BEAU: Love to.
- We're all goin' back to town.

1214
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,286
(♪ SHERIFF HUMMING)

1215
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,377
Hmm.

1216
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,379
Damn.

1217
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,424
Just when you think you got it made...

1218
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,260
just ain't made, is it?

1219
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,765
- You pretty good at this little thing?
- Not too good.

1220
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,184
Not too good, huh?

1221
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,895
Old bootlegger's sittin' there
with his own little game,

1222
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,523
and he ain't even good at his own game.

1223
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,444
Yes, sir, that is some good joke.

1224
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,575
I found these on the front seat.

1225
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,995
Wasn't any money in the car.
Went all through it, inside and out.

1226
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,623
Livestock business, huh?

1227
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,292
That whisky's for a friend.

1228
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,087
Hold out your hands.

1229
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,173
- Huh?
- I said, hold out your hands. You heard me.

1230
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,602
I didn't say put 'em down, did I?

1231
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:49,565
Mighty clean hands for livestock.

1232
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,483
Them hands don't look like
they do nothin' much

1233
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,735
except play a little casino
every now and then.

1234
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,737
I told you, that whisky's for a friend.
I didn't see no harm...

1235
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,114
Didn't see no harm?

1236
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:01,577
Hear that, Beau? Big bootlegger claims
he don't know the law.

1237
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,831
Well, Mr Bootlegger, I don't need no
couple of bottles to make a case against you.

1238
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,126
Law says all I need
is just one little ol' drop.

1239
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:13,422
And... law says you use a vehicle
to transport alcoholic beverages,

1240
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:17,801
and said vehicle is confiscated
to be sold at public auctions, so...

1241
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,679
you can just kiss that pretty
little ol' car of yours goodbye.

1242
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,556
Hey, hold on! That seems
pretty rough just because...

1243
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,225
Don't lower your hands.
I didn't tell you to lower your hands.

1244
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,269
I tell you to lower your hands,
then you lower your hands.

1245
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,980
You don't do nothin' till I tell you to.
Understand?

1246
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,565
Answer me. You understand?

1247
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,735
Yes, sir.

1248
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,908
Ah, I already done that.

1249
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:45,495
Ain't nothin' in his clothes 'cept him.
He ain't worth five cents.

1250
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,582
No, she ain't got
nothin' on her, either.

1251
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,044
You don't know what kind
of real bad trouble you're in.

1252
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,920
You better start thinking on it.

1253
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:57,424
I've got a case against you
for possession and transportin' whisky,

1254
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:00,469
and I reckon if I try,
I can think of a few other things.

1255
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:05,140
Better face it, you're going to be
up in these parts for quite a while,

1256
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:07,225
working on the county roads.

1257
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,603
Maybe you're lucky,
you get out in six months.

1258
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:13,649
Six more months, influencing a child -
maybe get six years for that.

1259
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,651
Maybe we could work something out.

1260
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,278
What's there to work out?

1261
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,031

Ah, I sure don't like to send a man
to a road gang. Never have.

1265
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,293
Always felt sorry for them poor devils.

1266
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:37,381
But I can't overlook the fact
that you've been paid $625,

1267

and you ain't tellin' me where it is.

1268

Now, I know you're a bootlegger,
so what's there for me to work out?

1269
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:48,475
All right. Let's cut this
ring-around-the-rosy.

Where's that... money?

You think I'm foolin' around?

I ain't foolin' around.

Maybe you'll come around in time.

1274

Get a little thirsty
and get a little hungry.

1275
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,350
Time sure does have a way
with criminals, don't it, Beau?

1276
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:31,893
Sure do.

1277
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:33,353
Well, it's gettin' on to 5:00.

1278

Somebody ought to be
stirring over at the café.

I think I'll step over there a while.

See if that friend
of the family's there.

1281

I'll be on back 'fore long.

It better. We got to have
some way of travelling.

Just have to fill out that form
on the back, and you own it.

1354

Ain't gonna swap.

01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:55,795
