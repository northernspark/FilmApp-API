<i>This is me
before the accident.</i>

3
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,845
<i>And here's me after I was
barbecued in jet fuel.</i>

4
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,686
<i>The old me was content,
virtuous,</i>

5
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,683
<i>believed in everything.</i>

7
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,968
<i>What an idiot.</i>

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,401
And now,
we have a very special young lady

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,323
with a message of healing.

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,971
Lamb Mannerheim has been
a member of our church family

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,328
since she was
knee high to a bug.

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,768
She's been a valued
youth evangelist,

13
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,764
the Valedictorian of
her home school collective,

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,571
and a performer right here
in our music ministry.

15
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,883
As all of you know,

16
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,043
our Lamb survived
a tragic accident

17
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,889
one year ago.

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,808
As a community,
we shared in her pain and loss.

19
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,044
But now she is
miraculously back on her feet,

20
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,602
and here with us
to share her message

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,411
of faith and courage.

22
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,529
Brothers and sisters,
Lamb Mannerheim.

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,122
Hi.

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,931
Thanks, Pastor Rick.
Pastor Rick.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,287
Good morning, everyone.

26
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,001
- Good morning.
- She looks so nice.

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,442
Look, I know you're all
pretending that you're here

28
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,966
for my testimony about how,
through the grace of God,

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,010
I recovered from
my near-fatal accident.

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,162
But let's be honest.

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,561
You're really just hoping to hear
the gory details about the crash.

32
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,847
Like, for instance,

33
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,207
how I could smell myself burning,

34
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,886
but I couldn't
actually feel anything.

35
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,930
Isn't that weird?

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,608
I landed in the parking lot
of a Kroger... on fire,

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,968
and all I could think
about was my shoes,

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,806
that they looked strange.

39
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,963
And then I realized,
oh, they're melting,

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,883
and so am I.

41
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,282
Well, the accident was bad,

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,727
but the surgeries...

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,202
the surgeries,
those were worse.

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,363
Did you know that they can
take skin from your rear end...

45
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,603
...and put it on your back?

46
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,685
But then, where does that
leave your rear end?

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,809
Looks like thong underwear is out
of the question for me now, right?

48
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,843
But enough about that.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,844
What I'm really here to say today
is that the horrible,

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,845
unspeakable torment
that I had to endure

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,810
didn't strengthen
my faith in the slightest.

52
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,327
No benevolent being would
do that to one of his children.

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,003
Doug.

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,689
So I feel compelled to share
my true testimony with you.

55
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,084
There is no God.

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,490
<i>There's me
before the crash again.</i>

57
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,848
<i>Perfect skin, perfect pitch.</i>

58
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,490
<i>Perfect bitch.</i>

59
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,607
<i>My parents watch this
all the time</i>

60
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,808
<i>to remember when
I was the golden child.</i>

61
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,009
<i>Makes me actually vomit.</i>

62
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,923
She is just sharing her gift.

63
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,321
<i>I should mention that
young ladies in my community</i>

64
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,845
<i>aren't allowed
to wear pants, go to college,</i>

65
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,167
<i>show their legs, cut their hair,</i>

66
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,641
<i>read popular fiction,
or listen to the radio.</i>

67
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,291
<i>This performance
is considered edgy.</i>

68
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,887
<i>But today, I was supposed
to get back on the proverbial bike,</i>

69
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,644
<i>walk into that church,</i>

70
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,963
<i>and show everyone how, through
my steadfast faith, I was healed.</i>

71
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,169
<i>Everyone was looking
forward to my testimony.</i>

72
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,290
<i>They were also pretty psyched
about my settlement money.</i>

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,925
<i>Now...</i>

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,771
I just picked this up in town.

75
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,209
It's all natural minerals
from the earth.

76
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,806
It's makeup.

77
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,522
It's to enhance your countenance.

78
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,648
There.

79
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,530
Dr. Cha says I'm not supposed
to put anything on there.

80
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,602
Lamb, it's 100% natural.

81
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,326
The lady at the mall says
she puts it on her 4-year-old.

82
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,641
Why?

83
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,402
Do you feel ready to give
your inspirational talk?

84
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,403
If you get stage fright,

85
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,609
just imagine Pastor Rick
in his pajamas.

86
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,247
No, thanks.

87
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,891
Let me just hear the beginning.

88
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,689
Do we really have to
do this right now?

89
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,000
<i>No.</i>

90
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,082
Just remember, our whole
community is relying on you today.

91
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,731
There is no God.

92
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,083
Don't touch me.
My skin grafts are really fragile.

93
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,323
I could bleed all over
your nice, new carpeting,

94
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,890
and then you'd have to
take up yet another collection.

95
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,644
Another collection.

96
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,609
You guys already tithed
most of your money

97
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,603
to this place anyway,
so what's the difference?

98
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,409
Get her down, Melanie.

99
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,006
- Lamb, stop.
- I'm almost done, Mama.

100
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,209
- I don't believe in God.
- Lamb.

101
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,965
But here's what I do believe.
I believe in science.

102
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,611
I believe in
the doctors and the nurses

103
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,648
who saved my life in the hospital.

104
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,291
I believe in
prescription opiates,

105
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,408
which work whether
you put faith in them or not,

106
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,562
- Lies!
- And I'm willing to believe that...

107
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,041
...the universe was created
in an explosion,

108
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,122
and that fish creatures
crawled out of the mud...

109
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,611
...and evolved into human beings.
- Devil's lies.

110
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,326
And finally, in our next
presidential election,

111
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,289
I may vote Democrat.

112
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,124
- Blasphemy!
- Democrat?!

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,567
Before I'm forcibly
removed from here,

114
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,085
I want to let you all know
that I am leaving Blakesley.

115
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,366
I'm out of here.

116
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,323
I'm going to Las Vegas,
Nevada, tomorrow,

117
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,047
where I plan to gamble
and dance.

118
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,088
- Heretic!
- And drink alcohol,

119
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,322
and frolic with
homosexuals and--

120
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,291
I'm very sorry.
My daughter is still recovering.

121
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,204
- What? Mother, I'm beautiful.
- Please pray for her.

122
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,601
Or don't. The last time
you prayed for me...

123
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,490
...I wound up looking like this.
- Let's get you out of here.

124
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,689
My arms look like
turkey bacon. God who?

125
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,888
<i>After church,
my parents cried and prayed,</i>

126
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,566
<i>and cry-prayed-</i>

127
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,563
<i>But it was too late.</i>

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,847
<i>I had booked
an economy class fare</i>

129
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,922
<i>to Satan's playground.</i>

130
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,930
<i>I've got a heart full of rage,</i>

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,685
<i>and an L.L. Bean tote bag
full of cash.</i>

132
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,491
<i>Hello, Las Vegas.</i>

133
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,323
<i>Let the sin begin.</i>

134
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,044
Wait, I've got
dishes in there. Oh!

135
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,042
I think that guy
broke my dishes.

136
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,521
Why you bring dishes
to Las Vegas?

137
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,400
We have plates, cups,
gravy boats.

138
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,164
Hey, sir, sir.

139
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,083
Do you have
a shoulder belt?

140
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,642
What, you want baby seat, too?
Goo-goo, ga-ga. Fisher-Price.

141
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,848
<i>My dad told me
I should run and hide</i>

142
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,684
<i>if I ever encounter a Muslim.</i>

143
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,367
<i>Unfortunately,
I'm in a moving vehicle.</i>

144
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,289
Ah, I hate this Trop light.

145
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,362
Trop light?

146
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,205
Tropicana.
Longest light in town.

147
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,930
Looks like Disney World.

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,924
You been there?
Disneyland?

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,082
I wasn't allowed,

150
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,447
because the Disney corporation
supports a homosexual agenda.

151
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,967
They even have a special day
at the park just for homosexuals.

152
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,168
Homosexuals, yeah.

153
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,969
Last night, in this cab,
I have two gay guys. They get married.

154
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,804
I have no problem with it.

155
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,723
As long as they keep
their penis in the pants.

156
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,802
I tell them, if I see the gay,

157
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,531
if I see any Doogie Howser
bullshit, you're out.

158
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,451
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Mickey Mouse.

159
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,128
You sure? Okay.
Red Lobster, baby.

160
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,569
Enjoy your Premium
Vista Suite, Miss Mannerheim.

161
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,165
Thanks.

162
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,402
I'm lovin' the hair
and the whole thing.

163
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,450
You goin' to that '80s night?

164
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,605
I've seen some people
really commit, but that is like...

165
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,324
tubular.

166
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,845
Totally.

167
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,641
<i>This requires
emergency action.</i>

168
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,604
<i>My mom calls glitter
Lucifer dust.</i>

169
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,806
<i>I'll take it in an extra-small.</i>

170
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,846
I only had, like, half,

171
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,321
but I'm rollin'
so hard right now.

172
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,880
Dude, I'm flyin'.

173
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,247
Hey, we should call
that chick from Marquee,

174
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,527
get some more for tonight.

175
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,648
Phenomenal.

176
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,369
Hi.

177
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,290
Hi.

178
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,721
Where you from, cutie?

179
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,803
Uh, does the curtains
match the drape?

180
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,606
Don't even make sense.

181
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,929
I look legit fat.

182
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,889
No, you don't.
You look gorgeous.

183
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,645
Zoe, those shoes
are phenomenal.

184
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,081
I think I should barf again.

185
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,768
Phenomenal.

186
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,881
Phenomenal.

187
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,646
Ah, shoot.

188
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,811
<i>I know you can't

<i>Chalet.</i>

Beautiful girls, hot girls.

Beautiful girls,
sexy girls, hot girls.

215
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,204
All right, almost naked.

216
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,890
Look at her.

217
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,530
Everybody smile.

218
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,410
Hi-Io, and welcome to
the Hi-Lo Room.

219
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,451
Would you like the first of your
two mandatory cocktails?

220
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,244
Stop singing!

221
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,766
I will have...

222
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,844
Seriously. Stop.

223
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,651
A peach schnapp.

224
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,724
- You're gonna have a...
- A peach schnapp.

225
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,565
Good choice, madam.
Very good choice.

226
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,962
Um, yes, would you like some
ice with your peach schnapp?

227
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,128
No, it takes up too much room.

228
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,440
I want as much liquor
as possible.

229
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,000
That's very smart.
Really smart.

230
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,048
<i>I've only ever known
one British person.</i>

231
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,690
Here's your peach schnapp.

232
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,922
<i>She was a 50-year-old
counselor at my youth camp</i>

234
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,360
<i>This man is not Gaye.</i>

235
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,286
"I dice Las Vegas."

236
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,283
Yeah, it doesn't really make sense.

237
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,570
Not unless you came to Vegas
to chop up its residents

238
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,802
into little cubes with a knife.

239
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,370
Gotta be the worst
thing I've ever seen.

240
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,930
Okay, thanks.

241
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,889
Yeah, right over here, baby.
No, don't go off-stage.

242
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,291
Don't go? What's up?

243
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,691
Are you gonna sing?

244
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,603
Wha...? No, no, no.

245
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,286
I don't sing.
I don't sing for nobody.

246
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,170
That whole bar-tainer thing,
that lacks dignity.

247
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,765
I'm a little bit too cool for--

248
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,080
Can you refill my dick?

249
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,606
I don't mind doing this, though.

250
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,967
This is perfectly respectable.

251
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,202
Here's your plastic
penis full of liquor.

252
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,726
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your lifestyle.

253
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
coming to the stage right now,

254
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,282
an immensely talented
young lady...

255
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,091
You're in luck tonight, because my
best friend Loray is about to perform.

256
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,481
She's amazing. Check this out.

257
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,483
You're in for a real treat.

258
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,562
...very own soulful diva,

259
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,041
Lo ray.

260
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,091
Oh, look at that dress.

261
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,771
- Oh, it's a black chick.
- Come on, baby.

262
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,842
Give me something, sister.

263
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,046
Hello, Hi-Lo.

264
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,124
Go, Aretha.

265
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,965
- Do Aretha.
- Come on, sister.

266
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,281
Girl's got a lot to give.

267
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,687
Oh, she's not supposed
to sing this. She's been warned.

268
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,322
Turn the volume down
on your dress, girl!

269
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,446
I thought she'd have soul.

270
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,728
Boo!

271
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,446
Get on outta here.

272
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,280
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much.

273
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,170
Thank you, Loray.
Loray, ladies and gentlemen.

274
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,082
I'm Lamb Mannerheim.

275
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,448
Hi. I'm William Carr.

276
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,363
Lovely to meet you.

277
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,200
Oh, Christ, are you...

278
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,931
are you all right?

279
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,241
Wow, I've never
seen that happen before.

280
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,846
You're using your nose
like a little funnel.

281
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,365
Are you all right, love?

282
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,885
That was my first drink ever.

283
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,167
Honestly?

284
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,844
I tell you what,
you could've fooled me.

285
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,809
You're like Humphrey Bogart
or something with that.

286
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,644
That was remarkable.

287
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,884
Let me get you something
that's a bit more your speed.

288
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,403
Do you want something
a bit stronger, like a gun?

289
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,086
Well, the good news is,

290
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,447
I'm off for the night.

291
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,682
The bad news is humanity.

292
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
Do you know what?
Screw humanity.

293
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,686
'Cause I was watching you out there,
Loray, and you were amazing.

294
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,364
Management keeps saying
they want me to sing

295
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,408
Aretha Franklin.
Can you believe that?

296
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,687
Yeah, I know.
It's really weird, isn't it,

297
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,491
that they want you to sing
an upbeat Aretha Franklin song

298
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,847
here in this place of merriment.

299
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,126
I think it's a conspiracy.

300
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,601
This is whitey
trying to keep you down.

301
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,441
I loved your song.
Did you write it?

302
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,443
No, it's Radiohead.

303
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,649
Is that spelled how it sounds?

304
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,760
Loray, this is Lamb,
my new friend.

305
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,888
Uh-oh.

306
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,406
Excuse me?

307
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,050
Let me guess.

308
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,169
You came here to be a showgirl.

309
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,210
- No.
- Oh, come on.

310
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,965
Sittin' here alone
on suicide Tuesday.

311
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,042
Weave down to your ass.

312
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,327
- My hair?
- Bleached blonde.

313
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,283
Real blonde, I'm half Finnish.

314
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,325
Well, look at that.
I'm half finished, too.

315
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,448
Top me off.

316
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,522
Do you know what, Lamb?

317
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,807
Loray may seem a little
abrasive and crude,

318
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,882
but underneath that exterior...

319
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,291
What are you doing?
Why are you not listening to me?

320
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,603
Why are you not enchanted?
Where are you going? Don't go in there!

321
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,602
Oh.

322
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,565
You look like an angry baby cobra.

323
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,525
Look, sorry for
givin' you shit back there.

324
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,650
Sometimes the entertainment
needs to be entertained.

325
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,291
- I'm not a showgirl.
- No one cares what you are, honey.

326
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,402
I care very much.

327
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,882
I care about the message
that I send out into the world.

328
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,567
Besides, I could never
do that anyway.

329
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,211
People would stare. My skin.

330
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,204
Yeah? I got a skin condition, too.

331
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,009
It's called black.

332
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,082
People would stare.

333
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,242
I don't know what that's like.

334
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,891
Do you wanna know
why I'm here?

335
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,884
I come from a small town
where I wasn't allowed

336
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,770
to date or dance or even
go to regular school.

337
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,640
I was in a plane crash
that left half my body disfigured,

338
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,404
and I don't think
I believe in God anymore.

339
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,363
I left home for
the first time today,

340
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,962
because I've missed out
on everything.

341
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,725
Now I just wanna...

342
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,531
experience worldly pleasures
for the first time.

343
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,409
Wow.

344
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,847
Am I in the first
five minutes of pornography?

345
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,526
That is quite
the pitch there, Lamb.

346
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,764
I mean, I have heard
some pretty crazy stories

347
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,805
from some broken
weirdoes

348
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,282
here in the People's
Republic of Bad Choices.

349
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,606
That story takes
the whole hash brownie.

350
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,841
Oh.

351
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,170
Oh.

352
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,043
Is it possible
you're tellin' the truth?

353
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,964
I just wanna be...

354
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,281
like, a regular American.

355
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,651
- So where we going?
- I don't know yet.

356
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,611
If I leave you by yourself, you're gonna
wind up someplace scary,

357
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,251
like the trunk of a car
or Circus Circus.

358
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,449
And I can't leave you here.

359
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,603
You're just a deep-fried
Twinkie from where?

360
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,691
- Montana.
- From Montana. Population four.

361
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,047
And you came here
to get your rocks off.

362
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,691
Did you even have
anything specific in mind?

363
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,003
A little drinking,
games of chance,

364
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,367
your basic abominations.

365
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,966
What's going on with you ladies?

366
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,566
I'm goin' downtown,
and I'm takin' her with me.

367
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,722
Right. Okay.

368
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,529
Why don't you leave her here?

369
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,524
Because I want to get drunk
and kiss boys,

370
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,206
and I don't wanna find this one
on a milk carton tomorrow.

371
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,203
You'd sell a lot of milk, though.

372
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,408
- Why don't you join us?
- Oh...

373
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,766
- That's... ah.
- Sorry.

374
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,202
I'm afraid William
is working until 4:00,

375
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,408
so he won't be doing
any joining this evening.

376
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,768
Actually, Carol has lost
custody of her kids,

377
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,969
as usual, so she wants
to work an extra shift,

378
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,883
so I could clock off at 11:00,

379
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,531
and I could come find you,
so why don't you give me a call...

380
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,921
- I got your number. Have a nice night.
- Make sure you call.

381
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,162
You look like
you're not gonna call.

382
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,846
Wait, this is to pay
for my schnapp.

383
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,366
Oh, that's really not necessary.

384
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,805
Thank you. What a sweet girl.

385
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,564
Make sure you call, right?

386
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,768
What's your last name?

387
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,205
Mannerheim.

388
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,009
- Jewish?
- No!

389
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,242
- Sorry?
- No, it's cool.

390
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,130
Did you really think
I was a Jew?

391
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,487
Wow. A Jew.

392
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,370
Could you, uh,
hold that thought?

393
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,124
I'll be right back.

394
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,889
Here ya' go.

395
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,086
Be lucky.

396
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,925
Hey, listen.

397
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,527
I was thinkin' maybe
you could stick around here.

398
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,443
Let Carol have the night off.

399
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,888
Carol needs structure
right now, okay?

400
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,770
And I like
the weird ones, you know?

401
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,810
This kid's far from home.
She's from Montana.

402
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,848
I'm from England.
You're not looking after me.

403
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,491
Do you know what it's like,
you know when you're a kid,

404
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,370
and you go to bed,
and it snows overnight,

405
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,602
and you wake up the next day,

406
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,763
and everything
looks pure and pristine

407
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,168
and perfect, and you just
wanna get your boots on,

408
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,527
and get out there and mess it up?

409
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,080
I'm from Florida.

410
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,051
Hey, can we go
to Chalet?

411
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,602
You know, Las Vegas'
hottest night club?

412
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,081
Chalet? No way.

413
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,486
The place is a health hazard.

414
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,130
Do you wanna get syphilis?

415
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,601
We are not going to Chalet.

416
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,284
You wanna see Las Vegas?

417
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,489
- Gotta go to Las Vegas.
- We're in Las Vegas.

418
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,882
No, we're not. We're in Paradise.

419
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,566
They call this the Vegas strip.

420
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,405
It's actually located in
a census-designated area

421
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,686
called Paradise.

422
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,366
Paradise, Nevada.

423
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,090
Most tourists don't know that.

424
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,844
They think they're going to Vegas,

425
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,410
when, technically,
they're in Paradise.

426
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,727
Maybe we should
just stay in Paradise.

427
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,361
No. Paradise is
processed cheese.

428
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,842
You want a rollercoaster,
and a fake Eiffel Tower,

429
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,649
and a bunch of people
from St. Louis

430
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,441
clappin' for a friggin'
computerized fountain?

431
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,602
Yay! Robot fountain.

432
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,002
No, you want
the real Las Vegas.

433
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,491
Where the locals go.

434
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,688
If you hate it so much,

435
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,366
why don't you just leave?

436
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,522
There's not a lot of call
for singing tap jockeys

437
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,523
in other parts of the country.

438
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,209
Where's your family?

439
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,170
You just met him.

440
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,887
Oh, the Trop light.

441
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,361
It's the worst, huh?

442
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,211
<i>Oy vey.</i>

443
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,008
Glitter gulch.

444
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,811
Here's some realism for you.

445
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,848
This is where you go to have fun?

446
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,287
Sure, when I'm not in school...

447
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,807
...or degrading myself at the Hi-Lo.
- You go to school?

448
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,402
Yeah. I'm finishing up
my bachelor's at UNLV,

449
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,689
if I can come up with seven grand.

450
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,167
Is that so shocking?

451
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,447
You don't have
any black friends, do you?

452
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,091
Everyone says they have
the one black friend.

453
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,764
You don't even know him, huh?

454
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,684
So what's your major?

455
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,524
Film.

456
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,887
How cool.

457
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,167
We didn't have anything
like that at my college.

458
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,969
Really?

459
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,283
No student filmmakers?
Nobody made shorts?

460
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,330
We weren't even allowed
to wear shorts.

461
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,969
Almost there. We just have
to cut through the experience.

462
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,202
What's the experience?

463
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,760
This baby boomer,
magic mushroom shit show.

464
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,891
Walk, Walk, walk!

465
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,884
Okay, Sherri Shepherd.

466
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,969
You wanna do that, huh?

467
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,771
Yeah. I really wanna do that.

468
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,969
I would need about ten drinks.

469
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,520
Oh, man.

470
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,410
Get back to me in an hour.

471
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,847
Oh, sin.

472
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,366
Perfect. Is that
where we're going?

473
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,490
Yeah, but it means
service industry night.

474
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,325
Cheap libations for those of us
in the hospitality sector.

475
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,482
Like bar-tainers?

476
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,007
Bar-tainers, waitrons,
gondoliers, go-go boys,

477
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,048
human sushi platters.

478
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,088
Human sushi platters?

479
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,004
Yeah. My friend Christian's
been doin' it for a year.

480
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,651
She has to wash herself
with this special soap.

481
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,121
Before or after?

482
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,010
Before. I think after,
she just cries.

483
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,166
All right, let's
get this over with. Pull.

484
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,684
<i>Sorry, pardner. Try again.</i>

485
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,401
- Did I lose?
- Uh, yeah, Lamb.

486
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,482
You lost. You gambled.

487
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,961
And now, you see why
it's pointless. Let's perambulate.

488
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,042
<i>Okay, what's bar?</i>

489
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,203
<i>Did I just pay a machine
to tell me where I am?</i>

490
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,045
- Charlie.
- What are we thinkin'?

491
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,885
I'm thinkin' we're gonna
need some shots.

492
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,405
Oh, my God.

493
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,290
What's up,
Little House on the Prairie?

494
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,964
Look at this denim skirt.

495
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,044
Hey, uh, Charlie, you got
any scissors back there?

496
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,766
I don't know.

497
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,411
My legs are gonna look weird.

498
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,643
Well, can't you take
these stockings off?

499
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,722
<i>No.</i>

500
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Well, there are girls here

501
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,962
that are lookin' stupid on purpose.

502
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,963
At least you can't help it.

503
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,887
What's that?

504
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,167
Uh, close.

505
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,211
We are going to do...

506
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,250
a reverse Ally Sheedy,

507
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,761
and whore you up a little.

508
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,446
- Not too much.
- Oh, come on now.

509
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,170
You don't need much.

510
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,928
You're already this
disgustingly perfect Barbie.

511
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,847
Barbie that got melted
by a lighter.

512
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,048
Lamb is, like, from
the backwoods of Montana.

513
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,124
- She was home schooled.
- No!

514
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,761
- That's inspiring.
- It is?

515
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,050
This is so cute on you. It'll cover up
some of your battle damage.

516
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,891
I like it.

517
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,167
- It's a keffiyeh.
- Pardon me?

518
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,005
A keffiyeh.
Like an Arab scarf.

519
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,321
You mean like Muslim?

520
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,926
The public school system
in this country is a joke.

521
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,480
The federal government,
the food pyramid.

522
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,643
Lamb... has never
been to a dance.

523
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,171
She doesn't have email,

524
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,686
and she's never even
seen an R-rated movie.

525
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,082
Don't worry, it's not offensive
to Muslims or anything.

526
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,528
These things are so popular,
they're totally depoliticized.

527
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,683
Basically, you've never been
exposed to any pop culture?

528
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,090
God, you're lucky.

529
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,730
Okay.

530
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,610
- Cute.
- So cute.

531
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,444
Phenomenal.

532
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,922
Why does everyone keep using
that word incorrectly?

533
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,884
It's inaccurate.
The scarf is not a phenomenon.

534
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,526
On you, it is.
You're fresh, bitch.

535
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,928
Oh, look who's on the dance floor,

536
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,923
and hell hasn't swallowed you up.

537
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,765
Are you sure?

538
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,640
Hey, I realize we do
have something in common.

539
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,926
We do, huh?

540
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,082
Yeah. You don't have
any black friends, either.

541
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,009
Drink your beer.

542
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,887
"Snowy Piste"?

543
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,883
It's ironically delicious.

544
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,446
Are you kidding me?
Sweet William, he found us.

545
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,206
How did he even
know we were here?

546
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,931
Jiminy Christmas.

547
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,251
Ladies. That's
a very nice makeover.

548
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,211
Loray Bell, you promised me you were
gonna look after this young lady,

549
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,529
and now, I find you
drinking Snowy Piste.

550
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,762
I haven't had a sip.

551
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,606
It's, uh, kinda turned out
that I'm a failure at drinking.

552
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,331
Well, it turns out that
you are alone in that,

553
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,290
because this woman
is a success at drinking.

554
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,362
We just bought ourselves
a stool-side seat

555
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,602
for a vomit spectacular
in a couple of hours.

556
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,603
Bravo.

557
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,809
I'm gonna go get some water.

558
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,609
See you in a minute.

559
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,849
Can I have some water?

560
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,091
Oi, what are you doing,

561
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,128
parading her around
like Elephant Man?

562
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,806
Oh, like you came here
with good intentions.

563
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,601
Yes, actually, all I am is
good intentions and good hair.

564
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,570
William, look,
this one is different, okay?

565
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,211
She's not like all of
your other "pals."

566
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,568
This one's from, like,
a religious commune, okay?

567
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,324
Where they keep women
as slaves

568
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,164
and force them to have 50 kids,

569
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,528
and make tater-tot casseroles.

570
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,568
Oh, and she's been
in a plane crash. No, seriously.

571
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,847
And her whole body's
all messed up,

572
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,400
and now, she's, like,
forsaken God.

573
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,960
Hey, Lamb.

574
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,123
Do you need some lubricating?

575
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,000
Would you like me to find you
somewhere to sit down?

576
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,209
No, I feel great.

577
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,087
Often, when I feel great,

578
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,970
I lean forlornly against a wall.

579
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,841
There's no seats.

580
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,361
There's actually a bar upstairs.

581
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,250
It's usually closed on weeknights,

582
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,891
but I'm kind of connected,
and you look like a social radical.

583
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,928
We could go and sit down
up there if you want.

584
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,526
I don't know.

585
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,085
I'm good.

586
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,329
- Are you scared of me?
- No.

587
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,609
You are a little bit.
I understand.

588
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,923
Why, because you're
wearing tight pants,

589
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,843
and you've got
some tattoos? Big deal.

590
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,446
I know preachers
who are as cool as you.

591
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,962
Those preachers
are appropriating

592
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,368
a rock-and-roll look
to sell religion,

593
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,602
when religion and rock and roll
are separate things,

594
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,967
and that look
was designed to sell...

595
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,202
something very different.

596
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,523
They're playing a part,
same as you.

597
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,204
I don't know what
you're trying to sell,

598
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,726
but I suspect you're
as toothless as they are.

599
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,689
Toothless?

600
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,603
If I'm so toothless,

601
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,842
then how come you're afraid
to come upstairs with me?

602
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,720
Afraid? You've
gotta be kidding me.

603
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,165
I've spent my entire life
being trained to follow

604
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,890
a man with long hair and a beard.

605
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,169
That would just be
downright predictable.

606
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,362
Know what, Lamb?

607
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,683
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna, uh, let you suffer.

608
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,081
- What?
- Yeah. No, seriously.

609
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,050
If you wanna show
how brave you are,

610
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,169
while simultaneously
sitting down in the toilets here,

611
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,402
some of the seats are
smothered in hepatitis B.

612
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,086
So you can kill
two birds with one stone.

613
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,288
Ta-ta.

614
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,082
All right, take me upstairs.

615
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,322
I just need a place to sit down.

616
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,448
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

617
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,166
I get really sore and stiff at night.

618
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,290
It's just, I can't really
move that well.

619
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,482
Well, neither can I.

620
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,369
And I haven't even got
a beautiful, tragic excuse.

621
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,602
Plus, I've got $100 that says that

622
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,365
you can still dance
a lot better than I can.

623
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,202
This is really nice.

624
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,364
Well, isn't that
a quirky little affectation?

625
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,046
Actually, it's for
the scar tissue in my hands.

626
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,682
"Rode hard"?

627
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,923
Yeah, um...
I had that done ages ago.

628
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,446
I grew up around horses.

629
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,444
Me, too. I grew up
in cattle country.

630
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,046
You ride Western or English?

631
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,246
Both.

632
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,806
What you looking for?

633
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,325
My medicine.

634
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,284
Oh, look. Isn't this awful?

635
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,488
You just dial a number,

636
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,562
and then a girl shows up
at your hotel room.

637
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,246
It's like ordering Chinese.

638
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,368
Sometimes literally.

639
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,842
Can't you see how young she is?

640
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,127
This probably isn't even
the actual girl,

641
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,929
if it makes you feel any better.

642
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,843
A lot of the time,
these pictures are fake.

643
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,685
It's a completely different girl
that shows up at your room,

644
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,366
let me tell ya'...
I hear, from a source.

645
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,730
- Oh, my gosh.
- You all right?

646
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,280
I only have six pills left.
I thought I brought more.

647
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,249
Six is a lot of pills, Lamb.

648
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,448
Six is nothing.

649
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,844
There's gotta be a 24-hour
pharmacy or something, right?

650
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,129
<i>Vegas is a 24-hour pharmacy.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

651
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,682
Just relax.
We'll get something later.

652
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,762
Okay.

653
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,571
You look like Santa Claus,

654
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,530
but just, like, thinner...

655
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,001
and hotter.

656
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,163
Ya' know, I prayed for
an Easy Bake oven

657
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,244
when I was a little girl;
I never got it, Santa.

658
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,009
Okay, I can't find your mouth.

659
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,084
<i>So...</i>

660
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,801
tell me about your family.

661
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,971
I had enough counseling
in the hospital.

662
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,361
<i>I'm on a couch with a man,</i>

663
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,602
<i>and both my feet are off the floor.</i>

664
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,808
<i>I mean, yeah, it's because
my stupid body is failing me,</i>

665
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,609
<i>but still, I'm a slut.</i>

666
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,800
Loray says you're
her only family.

667
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,770
- Loray said that about me?
- Yeah.

668
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,441
Loray does have family
down in Orlando.

669
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,206
She's got a little sister that
she basically raised herself,

670
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,566
because, you know...

671
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,444
you can see she's a caretaker still.

672
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,807
People are like that, aren't they?

673
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,609
She's got a nephew
she ain't even met.

674
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,126
I think he's, like,
two or three years old.

675
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,601
I'm not really good
with kid-type stuff.

676
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,809
Anyway, I keep saying to her
she needs to go down there

677
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,281
and reconnect,
'cause family's family.

678
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,806
If you got that stuff,
you need to...

679
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,043
but I think, for her,
it's very painful.

680
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,846
- Hey!
- Hey!

681
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,651
You guys, you have to
come downstairs immediately.

682
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,769
Some people are line dancing...

683
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,764
...as a joke.
- As a joke, they're line dancing?

684
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,531
Well, this is brilliant. Let's get NASA
on the phone. Someone call CNN.

685
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,489
She's resting.

686
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,562
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm feeling much better.

687
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,002
- Were you guys talkin' about me?
- Yeah, we were, actually.

688
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,969
We were having
a conversation entitled,

689
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,611
"Third Wheels of the World
Who Ruin People's Vibes,"

690
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,762
and your name came...
No, we weren't talking about you.

691
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,764
Why don't you talk about me?

692
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,160
She does this every time.

693
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,245
We get it, girl. You can put
your whole vagina on the floor.

694
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,288
Okay, all right, that's enough.

695
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,125
Loray, the truck is outside.

696
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,521
The special truck
that delivers the food

697
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,206
to the tummies of the drunk girls.

698
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,965
Yes. Hey, let's go and fill
Loray's little tummy.

699
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,805
- I love food so much. I love it.
- Everybody loves food.

700
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,406
I love it, I love it.

701
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,566
You're so cute, you little--

702
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,324
Okay, well done.

703
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,681
Sorry. Sorry about the damage.
Here she goes.

704
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,286
I need it. I need that.

705
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,249
You can keep that hat.

706
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,325
Okay, so listen,

707
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,609
we've done drinking and gambling,

708
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,126
you've been dancing
with, what is it you call them?

709
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,725
- Sodomites.
- Sodomites.

710
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,450
Love that word, love that word.

711
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,807
And I failed at all three.

712
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,490
No, don't say that. You were great.

713
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,801
Oh, but look.

714
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,803
- Wow. Brilliant.
- Petty theft.

715
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,928
That's one of mine.
Where did you get that?

716
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,765
- She nicked that from the bar, Loray.
- Okay, so what's next?

717
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,242
Because I am
such a nice person,

718
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,049
everyone passed this around,

719
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,804
and wrote down naughty things

720
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,804
they thought you should try.

721
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,809
- We can do some of that?
- Oh, yeah.

722
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,487
- All done.
- You whore.

723
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,885
Are you sure this is illegal?

724
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,571
Oi, you girls finished pissing?

725
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,569
Ready?

726
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,644
They try to connect the holes.

727
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,371
- Oh, my...
- Sorry

728
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,609
You're in luck, Skipper.
I just renewed my license.

729
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,004
Gosh, it's so short.

730
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,731
Feels so light.

731
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,531
Oh, you look totally butch.

732
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,444
Might as well drop you off
at the enlistment center.

733
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,807
Go cop your dope.

734
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,164
Pick-up for Mannerheim.

735
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,208
That's me. Thanks.

736
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,050
Thanks.

737
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,964
What's the matter?
You seem agitated.

738
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,247
Okay, so tell me,
how do I have fun?

739
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,607
'Cause I'm honestly
not having fun yet.

740
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,842
Bars are not fun.

741
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,968
The bar smelled like the flu.

742
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,408
Smelled like the section
at the pet store

743
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,289
where you get turtles.

744
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,567
And that adult magazine,

745
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,563
that was the most
revolting thing that I've ever seen.

746
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,610
It's not fun, William.

747
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,170
Maybe I'm not fun.

748
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,481
No, um...

749
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,881
you are fun.

750
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,281
- Really? You think I'm fun?
- Yeah.

751
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,408
And I'm not alone in that.

752
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,006
This little guy happens to think
you're hilarious, as well,

753
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,526
doesn't he? "No, I don't."
We're not gonna get into that.

754
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,043
Look, I think maybe you've just
not found your thing yet.

755
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,169
Okay, you guys,
now this is fun.

756
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,242
Hey, listen, if you're scared,

757
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,243
we don't have
to do this, you know.

758
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,721
No, no, of course I'm not scared.

759
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,689
This is almost like Disney.

760
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,411
- I'm so excited.
- Again with Disney.

761
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,165
Loray...

762
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,211
- I think you're Type D.
- What the hell is Type D?

763
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,329
You don't know what Type D is?
It means you're depressed.

764
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,562
Or maybe it's just
late on a Tuesday,

765
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,120
and I'm tired of being
your magical Negro.

766
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,804
Um, my what?

767
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,121
- No, no.
- Magical Negro.

768
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,124
Magical Negro
is a narrative convention

769
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,521
in which a black person
uses their special black wisdom

770
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,840
to help a white person in need.

771
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,161
We learned all about it in class.

772
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,641
<i>Ghost, Green Mile,
Bagger Vance.</i>

773
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,643
All magical Negroes.

774
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,802
You aren't a magical Negro,

775
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,882
and if you got so much
special black person wisdom,

776
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,804
how come you just texted your
ex-boyfriend those Carole King lyrics?

777
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,405
I got wisdom.

778
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,244
You haven't got wisdom.
Don't touch me now.

779
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,243
Lamb, don't I say a lot of things

780
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,846
that make you go,
"Wow, Loray just told me.

781
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,968
She's so insightful."

782
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,088
- Yeah, yeah.
- Racism.

783
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,760
Hold steady.
Are you all right, love?

784
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,171
Yeah, I'm fine.

785
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,720
Take it easy.
She's a little banged up.

786
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,371
Ma'am, if you have
a pre-existing medical condition...

787
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,727
...I can't let you ride this thing.
- I'm fine.

788
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,644
I'm fine.
I'm as healthy as a horse.

789
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,563
Which is, of course, very healthy.

790
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,564
I know about that 'cause
I'm an expert in equine matters.

791
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,610
You've never ridden a horse
a day in your life.

792
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,489
I'm ready.

793
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,967
What are you angry
with me for?

794
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,367
- You know why.
- Because of this?

795
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,363
Oh, look, you know I love you,

796
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,283
but you're makin' a play for a girl

797
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,681
who's held together
with Band-Aids and chewing gum.

798
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,649
You've been up her ass all night.

799
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,848
Bringing her here?

800
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,729
You know we'd never be
caught dead doin' this tacky shit,

801
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,723
and all just to defile
some poor girl from the sticks.

802
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,768
- In my defense--
- No!

803
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,128
You are makin' her
feel pretty, and that's cruel.

804
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,522
She is pretty.

805
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,251
She thinks I'm a good guy, Loray.

806
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,846
What a dumb-ass.

807
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,888
No one's thought I was good
since I was 9 years old.

808
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,962
Twelve for me.

809
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,646
That makes more sense.
You are a bit difficult.

810
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,882
I know it sounds weird
coming from me,

811
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,644
but I'd never take
advantage of her, ya' know?

812
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,609
You're right.

813
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,728
It does sound weird
coming from you.

814
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,450
William the Conqueror.

815
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,443
- Bill the Butcher.
- Slick Willie.

816
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,330
You lovers ready to go?

817
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,449
Oh, gag me.

818
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,809
I don't know how I let you guys
talk me into this!

819
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,926
Hey, you okay?

820
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,890
Yeah. I'm fabulous.

821
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,531
So, what's next?

822
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,887
Oh, my God.
You're bleeding. She's bleeding.

823
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,281
Whoa! Hey, what happened?

824
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,124
I'm fine. It's just my skin graft.

825
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,884
Skin graft? That sounds
like something that should

826
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,764
be dealt with in a hospital.

827
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,161
No. No hospitals.

828
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,561
I'm having fun.

829
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,086
I'm having fun in Sin City.

830
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,810
You guys, I'm fine.

831
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,405
Lamb, don't be embarrassed.

832
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,482
Let's just go to a clinic or a hospital,

833
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,688
and take it easy for a couple of hours.

834
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,161
I'm tired of taking it easy.

835
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,561
All I do is take it easy.

836
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,881
I can't stop taking those stupid pills.

837
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,564
I feel like I'm dying.

838
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,007
We're all dying on a cellular level.

839
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,162
My goodness, I never
thought about it that way.

840
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,567
- You're so wise.
- Okay, we're getting a bit distracted.

841
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,210
We've had enough fun tonight.

842
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,487
Let's take care for a little while.

843
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,722
No. All anybody wants to do
is take care of me. I'm sick of it.

844
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,121
You know what?
You're lucky, Lamb.

845
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,170
Look, I know you resent
the way you were raised,

846
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,651
all the church stuff and everything.

847
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,609
But there are worse things than being

848
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,048
a perky, privileged little blonde
with saviors everywhere.

849
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,011
At least people care where you go.

850
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,731
Your mama's probably
looking for you right now.

851
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,724
Nobody's looked for me in years.

852
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,849
Hell, last time
somebody Googled me,

853
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,570
there was no Google.

854
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,971
They had to Alta Vista that shit.

855
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,125
That's a lie. William said...

856
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,362
William said that you had family,
and they miss you.

857
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,967
He did, did he?
Well, this isn't about me.

858
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,884
Look, I didn't come here
to be coddled,

859
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,123
and be treated like I'm
some kind of fragile thing.

860
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,521
- Seriously?
- I'm just trying to connect with her.

861
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,602
- Shall we talk about this now?
- Connect?

862
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,603
I'm staying out, and I'm gonna
party my butt off,

863
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,444
whether you guys like it or not.

864
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,127
Hey, listen, I know we've
upset you, but can you not go?

865
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,248
I don't want you to be alone
in this city. I wanna take care of you.

866
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,845
Thank you for everything.

867
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,251
I'm not gonna be
your burden anymore.

868
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,130
Lamb? Lamb.

869
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,684
Brilliant idea you had,
bringin' her here.

870
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,603
- It's your fault.
- My fault?

871
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,682
"Dying on a cellular level"?
What does that even mean?

872
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,208
<i>The night is still young,</i>

873
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,126
<i>and I can't let some minor bleeding
keep me from major depravity.</i>

874
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,168
Phenomenal.

875
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,528
<i>Chalet, prepare
to get Mannerheimed.</i>

876
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,843
Free shots.

877
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,123
Take one.

878
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,042
Shots here.

879
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,284
I like it.
Show me a little more.

880
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,041
<i>Shots, shots, shots!</i>

881
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,211
Hey. Hey, Blondie.

882
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,602
- Come and sit with us.
- You wanna sit down?

883
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,523
Actually, I'll just take this.

884
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,242
Have another shot.

885
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,847
You got something
on your face, babe.

886
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,209
Stop.

887
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,009
Honey, something is on your face.

888
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,162
I have no idea what that is.

889
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,368
What is that?
Where you goin'?

890
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,681
You need to wash your face.

891
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,611
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

892
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,365
This is V.I.P., baby.
You got a V.I.P.?

893
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,927
I'm disabled.

894
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,728
You aren't gonna O.D., are you?

895
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,126
Why does this always
happen to me? Oh!

896
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,089
Wait, no, I need them.

897
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,085
I know, I know. Hydros?
That's not a bad way to go.

898
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,362
All right.

899
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,210
Wow! Where do you
buy your hair?

900
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,169
Is it human?

901
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,527
It's a miracle.

902
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,171
It's really thick.

903
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,208
No, you're...

904
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,845
you're Amber.

905
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,161
Do we know each other?

906
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,362
I can't believe it's you.

907
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,445
You're...
you're a magical prostitute.

908
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,521
Bye.

909
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,321
No, no, you don't understand.
It's a miracle.

910
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,880
Mm-hmm.

911
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,043
Please, just, uh,
just stay here and talk to me.

912
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,531
Please.

913
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,651
I'll pay you.

914
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,005
Well, she's gone.

915
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,208
Go and get her.

916
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,408
How am I supposed to do that?

917
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,450
She's been swallowed up
by the Vegas night, hasn't she?

918
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,046
I think
I might know where she is.

919
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,805
Honestly?

920
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,565
Unfortunately, yeah.

921
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,928
Yeah, but why would you tell me?

922
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,883
You've been trying
to get us separate all night.

923
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,764
You don't trust me, do you?

924
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,607
Remember that time
I got food poisoning at work,

925
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,684
and you guarded the entrance
to the women's bathroom

926
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,240
for, like, three hours?

927
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,926
The memory will never leave me.

928
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,401
And that time I needed someone

929
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,683
to go with me to my
junior thesis screening,

930
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,684
and you came and pretended
to be my brother?

931
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,684
Yeah, I do. I was very convincing
in the role of Derek.

932
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,446
Look, what I'm saying is,

933
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,648
I know you're a total creeper.

934
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,168
But just this once,

935
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,720
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

936
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,486
- So this is nice.
Uh-huh.

937
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,600
You need a mint.

938
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,964
This'll wake you up.
Here. Gratis.

939
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,566
Occupied.

940
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,964
What happened to you?

941
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,166
Um, well...

942
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,727
I was in a plane that went down.

943
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,968
The boy who was courting me--

944
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,686
my fiancé,
I'd reckon you'd call him--

945
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,242
he was a pilot in the Air Force.

946
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:54,451
Normally, our dates
were chaperoned by our parents,

947
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:56,602
but he wanted to take me
up in his plane,

948
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,286
and it only had two seats,

949
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:03,206
so my parents were willing
to make an exception,

950
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,169
just once.

951
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,040
He was a good pilot, but...

952
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,007
Did he get as messed up as you,

953
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,208
all that shit on your neck?

954
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,047
He lucked out.

955
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,130
- Not a scratch, huh?
- No, he died.

956
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,926
Amber...

957
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,083
I can't go back to Montana.

958
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,242
I've destroyed everything,

959
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,971
and I thought I could
live in a godless world,

960
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,045
but this is not what I expected.

961
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,885
This is so much worse than home.

962
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,043
Ha! Nothing's worse than home.

963
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,690
Trust me.

964
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,809
I'm scarred for life. No offense.

965
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,324
Um, I said 100.

966
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,449
I know. It's a couple of
thousand in cash.

967
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,763
You know what?

968
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,569
I'm gonna write you a check, too.

969
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,770
I know you professionals
probably can't take checks,

970
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,844
but I'm good for it, I swear.

971
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,329
Is this a joke?

972
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,370
There was a problem
with the plane.

973
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,125
Major mechanical failure.

974
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,170
My family... well,
my family and Micah's family,

975
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,288
we sued, and we won.

976
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,562
I'm worth, like, millions of dollars.

977
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,281
I was supposed to give
a lot of it to my church.

978
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,968
They were expecting a big
announcement on Sunday, and then...

979
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,604
well, it didn't really go
the way that they planned.

980
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,845
I think I have better ideas for it.

981
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,370
Yeah, yeah, I would...

982
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,445
say this is a real stroke of genius.

983
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:35,526
I have been so angry

984
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,682
at everyone.

985
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,281
Mostly God.

986
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,842
Is this a TV show?

987
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,088
Do they have TV shows like this?

988
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,607
Wow. Wow.

989
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,047
Oh, man, I'm gonna
buy a bunch of stuff

990
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,122
for my boys.

991
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,091
My one son, it's his birthday
next week, the same as mine.

992
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,369
He must have been a great gift.

993
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,727
Yeah.

994
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,245
How did you know my name?

995
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,084
I recognized you from the card.

996
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,090
You know, the card that
they hand out on the street.

997
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:22,484
I know, it's crazy.
What are the odds?

998
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,291
It's like plane crash odds.

999
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,806
I...

1000
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,723
You... Wait a minute.

1001
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,088
You recognized me
from that picture?

1002
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,369
That's, like, ten years ago.
I was a kid.

1003
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,290
You're the same person.

1004
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,963
No, I'm not.

1005
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,967
Yes, you are.

1006
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,329
Yes, you are.

1007
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,290
- Okay.
- It's still you.

1008
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,807
Okay. It's still me.

1009
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,163
Those are real, ya' know?

1010
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,170
Amber, you are fearfully
and wonderfully made.

1011
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,206
You found me.

1012
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,365
Feels like Christmas now.

1013
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,841
Yeah, that snow was a surprise.

1014
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,843
I wasn't expecting that at all.

1015
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,366
I wasn't even talking about the snow.

1016
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,044
Loray!

1017
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,283
- I'm so sorry.
- You went ghost on us.

1018
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,489
I'm sorry I went ghost on you.

1019
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,241
You small-town people sure like
to lay on the physical affection.

1020
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,890
What is this?

1021
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,770
Anthrax, probably.

1022
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:50,970
Magical, sparkly
anthrax from fairyland.

1023
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,849
How did you guys know where I was?

1024
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,400
We're people who live
in the world who know people.

1025
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,086
I spoke to my friend Jorge,
he works here.

1026
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,561
He said he saw
a blood-soaked blonde

1027
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,246
staggering into Chalet,
put two and two together.

1028
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,963
Well, you didn't
have to come after me.

1029
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,202
He insisted.

1030
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,681
Hey, listen,
I'm gonna get some ice

1031
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,121
for that beautiful little shoulder.

1032
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,725
Try not to do anything weird.

1033
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,928
Ow! That's my favorite arm.

1034
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,965
Hey, look, I gotta go.

1035
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,327
I'm workin' Beatles Brunch later.

1036
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,808
There's gonna be a lot of
half-priced mimosas,

1037
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,487
and idiots who don't even know
about George's solo stuff, so...

1038
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,490
You all squared away here?

1039
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,769
Yeah, I think so.

1040
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,491
Loray, thank you

1041
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,767
for a wonderful tour of Vegas.

1042
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,445
And thank you for
being worried about me.

1043
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,442
I think I'm ready
to go see the real world now.

1044
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,888
You're goin', huh?

1045
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,406
Yeah, I didn't think

1046
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,482
you would settle for
the half-scale version.

1047
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,524
- You're too smart.
- What about you?

1048
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,887
What about me?

1049
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,928
Why don't you try to get that degree,

1050
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,526
get out of Las Vegas, like you said?

1051
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,602
Where am I supposed to go?

1052
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,603
What about Florida?

1053
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,250
See that sister of yours.

1054
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,971
Florida.

1055
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,602
Florida.

1056
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,570
Yeah, I told ya',

1057
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,962
there's stuff there
I don't wanna face.

1058
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:38,365
Well, there's stuff here
I don't wanna face,

1059
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,807
but I'm doing it,

1060
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,803
even if it hurts.

1061
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,645
You always make things
sound so simple.

1062
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,568
Think I'll home-school my kid.

1063
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,203
I think I'll take that as a compliment.

1064
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,690
I wanna give you my phone number,

1065
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,842
in case you ever wanna,

1066
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,526
<i>you know...</i>

1067
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,967
- ...explore.
- Yeah, oh, okay.

1068
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,407
You're squishin' my cotton candy.

1069
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,971
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

1070
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,602
Hey, see you in the trenches.

1071
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,330
When are you working?

1072
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,643
Same time as you.
I'll be your Ringo.

1073
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,927
Love you.

1074
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,885
She's my mate.

1075
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,883
I know.

1076
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,048
What's with the dishes?

1077
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,885
Just, you know,

1078
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,883
in case I wanna eat something.

1079
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,689
Hotels are notorious
breeding grounds for bacteria.

1080
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,047
Yeah. I hear that

1081
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,202
hotel bedspreads are the worst.

1082
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,770
They never wash 'em,

1083
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,365
so if you shine a black light on there,

1084
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,244
they're completely covered in s...

1085
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,845
cigarette ash.

1086
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:22,607
- So should we...
- Should we what?

1087
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,570
You know what.

1088
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,445
Actually, I don't.

1089
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,649
It's, um, it's getting light,
so I'll close the curtains.

1090
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,848
You don't have to look at me.

1091
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,169
Why wouldn't I wanna see you?

1092
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,121
<i>Lamb, um...</i>

1093
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,441
I just came back here

1094
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,166
to make sure you got back safe,

1095
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,890
and to tuck you in.

1096
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,566
I don't need to be tucked in.

1097
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,484
It's okay. I know what to do.

1098
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,766
Whoa. No, no, no.

1099
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,367
- No, no, no.
- Why?

1100
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,920
Because it's not right.

1101
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,087
Because I'm hideous, right?

1102
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,403
No. Of course not.

1103
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,644
Do you know that
some people in my church

1104
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,127
think that God punished me?

1105
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,203
Maybe I did deserve it.

1106
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,567
No. No, you don't.

1107
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:38,806
You are a beautiful young woman
who got hurt, that's all.

1108
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,724
No, they don't want me anymore,
and you don't want me, either.

1109
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,326
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

1110
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,209
I would do crazy things
to you, given a chance.

1111
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,248
- No.
- I would. I would.

1112
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,482
- Under the right circumstances--
- You wouldn't.

1113
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,847
I would. I'd put you
back in intensive care, love.

1114
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,526
Sit down. I'd rip off

1115
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,649
these weird,
flesh-colored tight things.

1116
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,643
They're surgical support hose.

1117
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,802
Your surgical support hose,

1118
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,201
I'd tie you up with them. Yeah.

1119
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:10,841
But you're gonna
have to forget about that,

1120
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,367
because you're 21,
and you're new to the world,

1121
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,528
and there are gonna be other guys.

1122
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,682
There should be other guys.

1123
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,206
It shouldn't be like this.

1124
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,885
I won't let it be like this.

1125
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,010
Not at 4:00 a.m.,

1126
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,320
with a bloody arm,

1127
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,131
and with that...

1128
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,000
plaster zebra coldly watching us.

1129
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,368
I can make my own decisions.

1130
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,363
I can take care of myself.

1131
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,728
No, I know. I've noticed.

1132
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,287
You're also pretty good at taking
care of your server, aren't you?

1133
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,091
Yeah?

1134
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,164
So how long you
planning to stay here?

1135
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,811
I don't know.

1136
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,886
I just don't wanna go
back to Blakesley.

1137
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:05,205
Lamb, the world is not
just Blakesley

1138
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,607
or the Vegas strip.

1139
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,206
There are other places
on the continuum.

1140
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,282
It's not just this or that.

1141
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,482
I'm figuring that out.

1142
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,003
So what did happen
in that club, Lamb?

1143
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,610
Well, I went into
a bathroom with a hooker...

1144
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,763
Seriously? Bloody hell,
let me sit down for this.

1145
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,490
Not like that.

1146
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,767
She was the girl from...
Never mind.

1147
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,842
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

1148
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,321
Anyways, I was looking at her,

1149
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,928
and I realized that
everybody has scars,

1150
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,128
not just me.

1151
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,601
Yeah, the world is
full of the walking wounded.

1152
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,127
Exactly. But they don't
get compensated for it.

1153
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,125
Nobody calls them brave,
or an inspiration.

1154
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,282
I'm lucky.

1155
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,442
I have angels everywhere.

1156
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,364
Even in Vegas.

1157
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,891
- So now I know what I wanna do.
- Oh?

1158
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,645
I wanna go see the world,

1159
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,803
and I wanna give away my money.

1160
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,724
Well, that's a bit extreme.

1161
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,609
Why don't you try looking
after yourself for a little while...

1162
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,524
No, I've told you, I have
been tended to enough.

1163
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,171
Oh, hey.

1164
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,481
Can you give this to Loray?

1165
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,608
It's for school.

1166
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,921
Ooh, no, no, no. I'm not
getting involved in that.

1167
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,207
- Loray hates charity.
- So do I...

1168
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,282
...and I let her take me
on an all-night pity date.

1169
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,840
That's really sweet of you.

1170
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,888
I've gotta tell you, Lamb,

1171
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,042
you are awful at being awful.

1172
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,361
I gave it my best shot.

1173
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,845
What is that?

1174
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,526
That is a chocolate orgasm.

1175
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,001
I've never had one.

1176
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,202
Really?

1177
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,362
Never?

1178
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,046
Not even on your own,
in the bath, by mistake?

1179
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,202
I'm gonna try this.

1180
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,371
Mmm.

1181
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,201
See, I could be bad.

1182
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,011
Yeah. Yeah, you're really naughty.

1183
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:40,961
You're like a, um,
a confectionery Hitler.

1184
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,725
You gonna do that
all in on your own, are ya'?

1185
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,246
You know, that's what
killed Keith Moon.

1186
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,090
You know what?
You can stop here.

1187
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,771
- Right here?
- Yeah. Thank you.

1188
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,207
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1189
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,409
Oh, thank God!

1190
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:33,005
Are you hurt?

1191
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,880
NO. Mom, I'm happy-

1192
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,890
I'm happy-

1193
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,729
Is she in pain?

1194
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,531
She says she's happy.

1195
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,604
Oh, no.

1196
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:53,287
What I did in church,

1197
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,124
it was wrong.

1198
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,008
Disrespectful.

1199
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:04,291
I had a problem with people
shouting their beliefs at me.

1200
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,170
But then I went and did
the same thing in turn.

1201
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,211
Everyone understands that
you've been through a trial.

1202
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,045
They must've been upset.

1203
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,805
People tried to talk,

1204
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,963
but your mother wouldn't
let 'em get away with it.

1205
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,407
She would defend you
through anything.

1206
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,244
Really, Mom?

1207
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,721
You may not realize this, but, uh...

1208
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,605
I can be a bit of a maverick myself.

1209
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,411
Remember that sermon about
the dangers of yoga,

1210
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:36,689
and how it suddenly encourages
the worship of false idols?

1211
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:40,401
Well, I thought
that was a bunch of bunk.

1212
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:45,043
I went ahead and bought
a yoga DVD, and I've been using it.

1213
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,851
What do you think of that?

1214
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,123
Wow. Good for you, Mom.

1215
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,966
I just changed the positions
a little in my mind.

1216
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,441
Sun salutation
becomes God salutation.

1217
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,046
Down dog is down Satan.

1218
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,531
And so forth.

1219
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,046
We're not stuffy, honey.

1220
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,441
We're open to hearing
about your new beliefs,

1221
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,841
as long as they're
still very conservative.

1222
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,246
Do you guys wanna
watch something?

1223
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,050
I'm surprised you
wanted to see this again.

1224
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,929
I almost threw it in the trash.

1225
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,369
That was a special moment.
I won.

1226
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,970
It was a good day.

1227
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,641
The Anderson boy is not
much of a drummer.

1228
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,447
Well, he's not.

1229
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,891
- I'm gonna start singing again.
- That's great.

1230
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,281
As long as you continue
to sing unto the Lord.

1231
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,524
The Christian Lord,
not Buddha or Allah,

1232
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,046
or whomever else
they worship out there.

1233
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,122
That reminds me.

1234
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,885
I got this really cool scarf
on my trip that I want you to have.

1235
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,724
It would look
really great on you, Dad.

1236
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,962
Really?

1237
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,360
Thanks, honey.

1238
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,841
You should wear it to church.

1239
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,809
I will.

1240
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,249
Are you leaving again, Lamb?

1241
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,609
<i>William is still at the Hi-Lo.</i>

1242
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,411
<i>I heard he even gets
onstage once in a while.</i>

1243
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,131
<i>I finally got a cell phone,
and we text all the time.</i>

1244
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,446
<i>Smiley face.</i>

1245
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,443
<i>William told Lora y
the money was from</i>

1246
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,409
<i>an anonymous
magical college fund.</i>

1247
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,404
<i>She took it, and now, she has
an internship near her family.</i>

1248
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:30,563
<i>They live right by Disney World.
Isn't that cool?</i>

1249
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,328
<i>Dad's keffiyeh
sparked a fashion trend</i>

1250
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,408
<i>at Grace Redeemer.</i>

1251
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,771
<i>And me, I'm really different now.</i>

1252
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,968
<i>Yeah, I have better hair,</i>

1253
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,202
<i>but I'm also just better.</i>

1254
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,851
<i>I didn't believe I could be.</i>

1255
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,003
<i>And now, I wanna help
other people get better, too.</i>

1256
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,526
<i>Some folks say
this whole world is broken.</i>

1257
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,967
<i>I say it's paradise.</i>
