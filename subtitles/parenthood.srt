2
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:27,166
How about some red-hot peanuts?

3
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:30,042
Peanuts! Get your peanuts here!

4
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,105
Go! Go! Go! Go!

5
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:35,551
Safe!

6
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:42,157
Now batting for the Cardinals,
number 14, Stanley Boyer!

7
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,763
Come on!

8
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,365
We missed four innings.

9
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,773
Well, like l said, l had to stop
and do some business. Here. Sit down.

10
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,342
Hey, you usher,
can l talk to you a second?

11
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:04,847
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:12,513
Gil, this is Stan.
He´s gonna watch you for a while.

13
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:15,786
l have some friends l´m meeting.
l´ll be back for the ninth inning.

14
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,623
- Have fun, kid.
- Get your programs!

15
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:29,470
- So, Gilly, big baseball fan?
- Kind of.

16
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,236
Dad bring you here a lot?

17
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:35,938
Once a year on my birthday.
Then he pays an usher to watch me.

18
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,615
Oh, l see.

19
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:46,585
You have to understand,
my father in his own childhood...

20
00:01:46,657 --> 00:01:49,751
was without a positive
male influence.

21
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:51,260
Huh?

22
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,594
His own father kicked him out
when he was 15...

23
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:59,000
so my dad was taught to see
child raising as a burden--

24
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,234
a prison rather than a playground.

25
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,243
You understand what l´m saying?

26
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:09,747
- You don´t talk like a kid.
- Well, l´m not really a kid.

27
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:12,806
- You´re not a duck.
- l´m remembering when l was a kid.

28
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:16,820
l´m 35 now.
l have kids of my own.

29
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,489
You don´t really even exist.

30
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,026
- You´re an amalgam.
- A what?

31
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:29,798
A combination of several ushers
my dad left me with over the years.

32
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:33,668
- l combined them into one memory.
- Why?

33
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:36,707
This was a great
symbolic moment in my life.

34
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,935
My father dumping me with you.

35
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,946
lt´s why l swore things would be
different with my kids.

36
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:47,917
lt´s my dream--
strong, happy, confident kids.

37
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:50,011
That´s great.

38
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:54,923
You´ve got a lovely family,
and l´m a goddamn amalgam!

39
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:00,722
Who´s that?

40
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:03,790
- That´s my wife.
- Nice.

41
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:07,529
Yeah?

42
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,630
Game´s over, honey.

43
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:14,234
The St. Louis Cardinals thank you
for attending today´s game.

44
00:03:14,312 --> 00:03:17,372
Please drive home safely
and soberly.

45
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,847
Let´s go.

46
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:22,353
Come on, Justin.
Do you want to walk? Let´s walk.

47
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,288
lt´s fun. Come on. Let´s walk.
Sure you don´t want to walk?

48
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:27,847
There we go.

49
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:31,086
l´ll get it.

50
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:36,299
There´s your pennant.

51
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:11,026
Watch it!
Watch the car.

52
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:13,434
Watch it.
There´s so many cars.

53
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,709
Want me to put you down?

54
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:41,498
Where is that kid?
Where is she?

55
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,898
- Daddy!
- Oh, there she is.

56
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:50,606
Get in the seat.
Buckle up.

57
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:08,321
- Honey? Taylor.
- Hey, hey, hey!

58
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:11,621
You´re a rat.

59
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:45,824
When you´re slidin´ into first
and you´re feelin´ something burst

60
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:48,492
Diarrhea, diarrhea

61
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:52,128
When you´re slidin´ into third
and you lay a juicy turd

62
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:54,798
Diarrhea, diarrhea

63
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:57,671
When you´re slidin´ into home
and your shorts are full of foam

64
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:03,344
When you´re sitting in your Chevy
and your shorts are feeling heavy

65
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:08,653
Kevin, honey,
where did you learn that song?

66
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:10,814
Last summer at camp, Mom.

67
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,551
Ah, that was money well spent.

68
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:18,726
When you´re slidin´ into first
and you´re feelin´ something burst

69
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:21,231
Diarrhea, diarrhea

70
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:44,918
That´s what you´re gonna sleep in?
You´ll get cold.

71
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,384
Perfect.

72
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:53,158
Gil, Taylor isn´t feeling well.
She wants you.

73
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:56,599
- lt´s those hot dogs.
- l´ll deal with Kevin and Justin.

74
00:06:56,668 --> 00:07:01,367
Hey, what do you say? Later when
the kids are asleep, l wear this outfit?

75
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:04,375
She´s in our bed.

76
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,448
Hi, Daddy.

77
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:15,413
What´s the matter, honey?
You don´t feel so good?

78
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:18,422
- You feel like you want to throw up?
- Okay.

79
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,617
Oh, my God.
Oh, Taylor, baby, sweetie.

80
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:27,497
Gil, why are you
just standing there?

81
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:31,366
l´m waiting for her head
to spin around.

82
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:55,159
Oh, can you come with me to see
Kevin´s principal on Monday?

83
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:59,631
Oh, l love it when you talk to me
about school and meetings.

84
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:03,135
- Now talk to me about shopping.
- l know. l´m sorry.

85
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:05,899
l just remembered now.
l´ve been meaning to ask you.

86
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:08,736
Fine. l´ll be there.

87
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:16,404
What´s the matter?

88
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:19,452
Nothing. l was
a little tense before, but--

89
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,011
No, l mean with Kevin.
Why are we going to see his principal?

90
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:26,820
Oh, because his teacher said
he´s been making that face again.

91
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,827
Oh, what, this?

92
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:32,759
Yes, the tense face.

93
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:35,858
He makes that same face
at Little League.

94
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:39,234
- You know what his teacher asked me?
- What?

95
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:43,241
lf we´d ever taken him
for a psychiatric evaluation.

96
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:48,010
- What?
- She was just asking.

97
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:53,718
Why? Because he makes a face?
Has she ever looked in the mirror?

98
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:57,984
Well, you know, the face,
the crying, the nervousness.

99
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:00,890
- They mentioned the crying?
- Yeah.

100
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,521
You know, he doesn´t really
finish his work.

101
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:10,401
Hey, we´ll talk to them on Monday.

102
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,371
Don´t worry.
l´m sure he´ll be fine.

103
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,031
Come here.

104
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,602
Where was l?

105
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,615
- Was l here?
- Yeah.

106
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:25,617
- l was there already?
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,349
That really pisses me off.

108
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,991
The kid needs a little
more attention...

109
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:40,589
so the teacher´s gonna put
a label on him: ''problem kid.''

110
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,659
Let´s find out who Kevin´s teacher
is gonna be next year...

111
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:46,637
and make sure it´s not
one of these hysterics!

112
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:49,072
You´re right, Gil.
Kevin´s great.

113
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:51,372
He can´t be that much of a problem.

114
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:55,005
Right. Now, if it was
my sister´s kid--

115
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:57,015
Garry.

116
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,009
There´s a kid with problems.

117
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:26,945
Hi, Garry.
You´re up so early.

118
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:28,776
Yeah.

119
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:37,789
- Where are you going?
- Out.

120
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:43,027
- What´s in the bag?
- Nothing.

121
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:47,260
The whole family´s coming tonight.
There´s a big surprise.

122
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,392
Grandma and Grandpa
are gonna be here.

123
00:10:49,469 --> 00:10:51,960
Uncle Gil and Aunt Karen
are bringing their kids.

124
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:55,475
Aunt Susie´s gonna be here
and Uncle Nathan and their kids.

125
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,476
lt was nice talking to ya.

126
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:03,615
Julie.

127
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,180
- Hey, Julie.
- Yeah?

128
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:11,952
- Can l come in for a minute?
- Yeah.

129
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:16,156
l really need your help.
The whole family´s coming tonight.

130
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,757
- Could you just give me a hand?
- Yeah, in just a few minutes.

131
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,199
Are you all right?
l heard you moaning last night.

132
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:25,500
l had a stomachache,
but it´s fine now.

133
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:28,564
- You hate me?
- What?

134
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:31,941
For making you study so much
and giving up all your dates.

135
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,775
No, you were right.

136
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:37,613
Honey, l´m telling you,
those SAT scores are your ticket.

137
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:40,085
And, sweetie,
once you get to school...

138
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:44,523
you´re gonna meet a lot of guys
you like just as well as that Tod.

139
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:47,560
Why do you always say ''that Tod''?
lt sounds so--

140
00:11:47,628 --> 00:11:51,860
You´re right. l´m sorry.
lt´s been pleasant for a moment.

141
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:55,663
l´m just gonna give everybody
spaghetti and salad...

142
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,227
and l better cook a steak
for my dad.

143
00:11:58,305 --> 00:12:00,432
See you later, honey.

144
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:04,810
You okay?

145
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,578
Man, your mother can talk!

146
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:14,310
Gosh, she hates my ass.

147
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:16,686
And it´s such a cute ass.

148
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:21,585
Last night she heard the moaning.
She thought it was me.

149
00:12:21,662 --> 00:12:25,029
So you´re gonna have to try
and control yourself, Tod.

150
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,098
With you, it´s impossible.

151
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:41,136
Wait. l brought something.

152
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:42,648
Ooh, good.

153
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:52,116
We can record our love.

154
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,956
Susan? Hi, sis. lt´s Helen.

155
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:57,428
Did l loan you my big platter?

156
00:12:57,498 --> 00:13:01,195
Great. Would you bring it tonight?
l just need it to serve.

157
00:13:01,268 --> 00:13:06,296
Listen, Julie got 1291
on her SAT´s.

158
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:10,165
l know.
l feel so proud of her.

159
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,804
lt´s great. How´s Patty?

160
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,815
We´re a little disappointed
with the effort...

161
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:18,443
she´s been giving
lately towards her work.

162
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,182
Math, French,
everything´s gone downhill.

163
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:25,191
Nathan´s talking to her right now.

164
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,727
He´s trying to figure out
what´s wrong.

165
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:30,059
Look, Patty,
all l´m saying is...

166
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,566
if you want to have
just an ordinary academic career...

167
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:37,297
and attend an ordinary university,
that´s your prerogative.

168
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:41,364
But l must tell you, l think
you´re selling yourself way short.

169
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:43,875
- How´s it going?
- l don´t know.

170
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:47,402
Sometimes l feel as though
we want it more than she does.

171
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:51,607
Patty, you know we love you.

172
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:56,385
Could you just give your father
that extra effort he´s looking for?

173
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,984
Okay, Mama.

174
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,364
That´s all l ask.

175
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,492
Come on, Kevin. l got you.

176
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:11,067
l want that, Kevin.

177
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:18,407
- Time to come in now, children.
- Hi, Grandma.

178
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:21,481
Hey, you want to--

179
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:26,253
- Grandma.
- Gil, you have a good memory.

180
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:30,052
Was it yours or Helen´s
or Susan´s wedding l got drunk at?

181
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:33,252
lt was all three, Dad.
Congratulations.

182
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:35,626
At which one
did l punch the bandleader?

183
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:38,759
That was mine.
We have photos.

184
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,165
l´m having them blown up
for the commitment hearings.

185
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:46,566
You think he´s funny, huh?
He wasn´t this funny as a kid.

186
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:51,578
Stayed in his room all day.
You were a moody son of a bitch.

187
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:54,975
Gee, l wonder why.

188
00:14:56,117 --> 00:14:58,847
Do you remember that little guy
who wouldn´t leave my side?

189
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,852
l know.

190
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:04,290
Now if l take a step toward him,
he takes a step away.

191
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,487
l don´t know
what´s happening to him.

192
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:10,588
He´s just so unhappy,
and he won´t talk to me...

193
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:13,156
and l don´t know how to help him.

194
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,828
Did you ever consider
having Ed talk to him?

195
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:20,637
Are you kidding? He won´t even
acknowledge he´s got these kids...

196
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:24,701
now that he´s got his new wife
and his new kids.

197
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:28,680
He won´t even fix
my kids´ teeth anymore.

198
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,480
He says it makes him uncomfortable.

199
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:34,521
l wish he´d drop his drill
down his pants.

200
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,648
Are you seeing anybody?

201
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:41,593
Well, Garry´s biology teacher
asked me out.

202
00:15:41,663 --> 00:15:44,655
Biology? That´s promising.

203
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:48,395
Oh, no. He´s not the type
l usually go for.

204
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:55,138
''The Penal Colony'' by Franz Kafka.

205
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,109
Patty a doctor yet?

206
00:15:57,946 --> 00:15:59,379
Mock if you will.

207
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:00,971
All right.

208
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:04,485
Our children are more capable of
absorbing information than we are...

209
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:07,316
yet we insist on treating them
like adorable little morons.

210
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:13,825
Are you saying Patty
can learn things l can´t learn?

211
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:19,924
Patty, which one of these...

212
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:22,993
is the square root of 8,649?

213
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:31,077
Ninety-three.

214
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:43,347
They´re like sponges, Gil,
just waiting to absorb.

215
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:45,324
l want this.

216
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:46,826
You see?

217
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:50,793
Take my advice.
Forget about Kevin and Taylor.

218
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:53,266
lt´s too late.
Work on Justin.

219
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:58,204
Actually, Justin is quite bright. ln his
preschool class, he was the only--

220
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:04,005
Slow down, Justin.
l´ll get you some dip.

221
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,850
You remember that guy you went out
with in college, Jeffrey Sanders?

222
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,889
He always chased me out of the room
when he came over.

223
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:17,050
- Oh, yeah.
- l saw him today.

224
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:21,153
- God, what a loser, huh?
- ln a Rolls.

225
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,164
l meant me.

226
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,325
What is that?

227
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:28,370
Oh, Nathan and Patty and l
are ''power eating.''

228
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,598
We bring our own food everywhere.

229
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:33,470
Nathan turned me on to it,
and l never felt better.

230
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,737
- Where do you get that stuff?
- This is it.

231
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:39,247
Everybody in the living room.
This is the big surprise.

232
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:42,909
Oh, Larry!

233
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:44,418
My baby!

234
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,915
- You look great. Dad!
- Oh, hi, son.

235
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,517
Great to see you!

236
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:53,959
- Shit.
- Well put.

237
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,259
Who´s that?

238
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:59,266
That´s my kid brother Larry,
your uncle.

239
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:01,894
- Don´t give him any money.
- l won´t.

240
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,906
Just a little something for being
the best dad in the world.

241
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:10,700
l found it a couple of months ago.
lt´s for your collection.

242
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,771
- A toy car!
- Oh, this is great!

243
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:15,544
A Stutz!

244
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:19,075
Yeah, if you´ve got it,
spend it on the people you love.

245
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:21,179
Right?

246
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:25,551
- ls this Grandma?
- Yeah, she´s still alive.

247
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,494
Jesus! Grandma, you got short.

248
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,037
l´m shrinking.

249
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:38,835
Bummer!

250
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:41,332
Gilbo!

251
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:48,306
- How long has it been? Three years?
- About that.

252
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:51,113
You stopped wearing your turban.

253
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:52,619
Yeah.

254
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:56,783
My God!
Susan, you look great.

255
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,952
lf you weren´t my sister--

256
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:05,459
l know it´s been hard.

257
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:07,434
Dad?

258
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:13,908
You were supposed to wait outside
so l could introduce you.

259
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,774
Well, why don´t you do it now,
Larry?

260
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:28,922
Everybody...

261
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:33,259
this is my son, Cool.

262
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:39,467
- Did he say ''Cool''?
- Cool.

263
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:43,164
- Your son?
- lt´s a long story.

264
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,672
Let´s eat.

265
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:52,175
Keep Patty away from my brother.
He´ll suck the intelligence out of her.

266
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:58,684
Cool is adorable. Why didn´t you
ever write us you had a son?

267
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:01,656
l didn´t know myself
until a couple of months ago.

268
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,488
See...

269
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:08,019
a few years ago l was living
in Vegas with this girl.

270
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:11,965
A showgirl. She was
in that show, ''Elvis On lce.''

271
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:14,560
Anyway, we drifted apart...

272
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:17,765
as people do
in these complicated times...

273
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,209
and then a couple of months ago,
she shows up with Cool, tells me...

274
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:27,272
''You watch him. l shot someone.
l have to leave the country.''

275
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,843
That´s a parent?

276
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:33,547
Anyway...

277
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:37,684
we´re back in town because l´ve got
something really huge cooking.

278
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,423
Enormous. Monster.
Dad, this is it.

279
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:44,466
From now on, l´m gonna be
taking care of all of you.

280
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,901
This isn´t another get-rich-quick
scheme, is it, Larry?

281
00:20:48,972 --> 00:20:50,769
What´s wrong
with getting rich quick?

282
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,435
Quick is the best way to get rich.
Look who l´m talking to.

283
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,444
You ever see her family?

284
00:20:56,512 --> 00:21:00,778
They find a nickel, they huddle together
and bury it like squirrels.

285
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,284
What´s the deal, son?
What do you have going?

286
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:08,415
Has anyone heard of hydroponics?

287
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:09,958
Well, that´s great!

288
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:14,520
Hydroponics is the growing
of plants without soil.

289
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:18,556
What are you using? Coarse sand
or suspension hydroponics?

290
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:20,125
l don´t--

291
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:25,971
There´s a guy with a lab coat that
makes that decision. l make the deal.

292
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:30,604
And l got to thinking,
Cool´s had no kind of life, no family.

293
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,878
So while l´m locking this down,
l thought we would stay with you.

294
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:36,885
- With us?
- A couple of weeks.

295
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:41,754
The thing is, we don´t have
the big house anymore, you know.

296
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:45,225
We just have the one bedroom for us
and one for Grandma.

297
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:48,025
Grandma´s welcome
to stay with us for a while.

298
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:51,396
lt´d be valuable for Patty to have
a multigenerational influence.

299
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:54,029
Fine with me.

300
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:57,300
Well, l´ll have to give you
a list of her medications--

301
00:21:57,373 --> 00:21:59,841
and you´ll have to pick up
her shower chair.

302
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:03,504
There´s her hearing aid batteries,
magnifying glass for reading.

303
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:05,012
Oh, geez.

304
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:08,016
- What happened?
- Your mouth used up all the power.

305
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:10,245
Don´t worry, Dad.
We can still find the bar.

306
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,118
- l´ll get a flashlight.
- l´ll get it, sis.

307
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:15,714
- Where is it? ln the bedroom?
- lt´s in the nightstand.

308
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,987
Mom, Dad, what happened?

309
00:22:18,895 --> 00:22:21,887
- You know l don´t like it in the dark.
- This is a blackout.

310
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:25,195
lt´s a temporary interruption
in the home´s electrical supply.

311
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:26,758
Something´s busted.

312
00:22:26,836 --> 00:22:29,168
Where´s the switch?

313
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:33,770
- Bring it here.
- Oh, here it is.

314
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:35,470
What is this?

315
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:49,616
- Mommy, what was that?
- That was an electric ear cleaner.

316
00:22:49,692 --> 00:22:53,424
- lt was kind of big.
- lt sure was!

317
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,064
l don´t think we really
have to worry about him.

318
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:02,605
The point is, once they see us
they´ll realize...

319
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,608
that we´re fine
and the kid is fine.

320
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:19,889
l think we have to be very careful
about Kevin´s educational environment.

321
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,549
Absolutely.

322
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:25,220
With that in mind, l don´t think
Kevin should come back here next fall.

323
00:23:26,263 --> 00:23:28,857
l recommend that he
be transferred to a school...

324
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:32,095
that offers
special education classes.

325
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:36,132
You mean,
because he´s so smart?

326
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:41,439
Well, actually, l mean a class
for children with emotional problems.

327
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,976
Hi. l´m sorry l´m late.

328
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,179
You must be the Buckmans.
l´m Dr. Jeffrey Lucas.

329
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:53,519
Dr. Lucas is a child psychologist.

330
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,991
He´s been observing Kevin
for the last couple of months.

331
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:00,262
Why?

332
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:06,328
Mr. Buckman, this is a public school.
Thirty-eight kids to a class.

333
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,497
We estimate that Kevin´s teacher
spent at least...

334
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,872
20% of her time dealing with Kevin.

335
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:17,039
That class is going to finish
the year behind. lt isn´t fair.

336
00:24:17,114 --> 00:24:22,313
Kevin is a very sweet, sensitive,
extremely tense little boy.

337
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:24,980
He needs some special attention.

338
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:29,018
- lt´s ´cause he was first.
- Hmm?

339
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,458
lt´s because he was our first.

340
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:34,588
l mean, l think we were very tense
when Kevin was little.

341
00:24:34,665 --> 00:24:37,600
lf he got a scratch,
we were hysterical.

342
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:41,331
By the third kid, you know,
you let them juggle knives.

343
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:44,738
On the other hand, Kevin may
have been like this in the womb.

344
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:48,539
Recent studies indicate that
these things are all chemical.

345
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,240
She smoked grass.

346
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:57,151
- l never smoked when l was pregnant.
- ln college, you were like a chimney--

347
00:24:57,221 --> 00:24:59,086
Fifteen years ago.

348
00:24:59,156 --> 00:25:01,181
There could have been
some chromosome distortion.

349
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:03,692
Well, you let them do anything.

350
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,661
You let them watch TV
just like that.

351
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:12,168
So we´ll put the TV´s in the garbage,
and we´ll perform Shakespeare--

352
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,037
l´m sorry.

353
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:24,374
l´m just a little
thrown off by this.

354
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,855
You should not look upon Kevin´s
going to a special school...

355
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:35,448
as any kind of failure
on your part.

356
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,355
No, l´ll blame the dog.

357
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:43,232
ln an educational environment
that´s more sensitive to his needs.

358
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,633
First of all, Kevin is not going
to a special school.

359
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:49,365
Whether it´s right or not,
there´s a stigma.

360
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,373
Children are cruel.

361
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,900
l won´t subject Kevin
to that kind of cruelty.

362
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,172
lf we have to, we´ll send him
to a private school.

363
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,481
l don´t care what it costs.
l´ll get a second job.

364
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:07,423
Mr. and Mrs. Buckman,
this problem won´t just go away.

365
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:11,394
lf we need to, we´ll send Kevin
to a private therapist.

366
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:15,626
That´s right. Look, it´s a problem.
We´re aware of it.

367
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,430
But we´re his parents.
We can handle it.

368
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:25,134
Well, the next school year
is four months off...

369
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:29,669
so let´s see
what can be accomplished, hmm?

370
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:40,249
- l need to see.
- No, not in the street.

371
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:41,758
Please.

372
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:53,730
What is this?

373
00:26:53,805 --> 00:26:56,569
lt´s the party celebrating
my mother´s promotion at the bank.

374
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:04,470
Excuse me. This is the wrong batch.
This is my mother´s.

375
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:07,484
There should be another envelope
for Buckman.

376
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:14,820
That was picked up already.

377
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:17,053
By who?

378
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,247
l, l, l think this one
is my favorite.

379
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:47,757
This is just--

380
00:27:47,825 --> 00:27:50,191
lt was just for fun, Mom.

381
00:27:50,261 --> 00:27:53,321
Well, l´m glad to know
it´s not a job.

382
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:57,266
lt´s that Tod, isn´t it?
There´s one where you can see his face.

383
00:27:57,335 --> 00:28:01,294
Does it bother you that l did those
things or that l did them with Tod?

384
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:05,138
Gee whiz, Julie. There´s so many things
that bother me about this...

385
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:07,302
l don´t know how to separate them.

386
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,481
Whoo! Here´s something
for my wallet.

387
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:13,642
Tod is very important to me.

388
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:16,380
And we´ve got the pictures
to prove it.

389
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:18,388
- Mom.
- This is your room.

390
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:21,983
You did these things
right here in my house?

391
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,587
Well, l thought someone in
this house ought to be having sex.

392
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:28,860
l mean, with something
that doesn´t require batteries.

393
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,869
What did you say to me?
Goddamn it! You get back here!

394
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:36,998
Open this door!
Goddamn it to hell!

395
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:39,543
l would just like a little respect!

396
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,840
Not a lot, just a little!

397
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:45,076
Do you know why l´m having sex
with machinery?

398
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:49,586
Because your father left to have a party
and l stayed to raise two kids!

399
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:51,282
l have no life!

400
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:55,884
Goddamn it!
What are you doing?

401
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:58,361
l´m leaving before we say things
we´ll regret.

402
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,263
You´re gonna say something worse
than the battery remark?

403
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,766
Tod and l are in love.

404
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:06,399
lt´s not ''going steady'' love.
lt´s love.

405
00:29:06,472 --> 00:29:08,997
l need him. He´s my life.

406
00:29:09,074 --> 00:29:11,702
He touches me, and l quiver.

407
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:14,575
Oh, would you give me
just a small break?

408
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,580
See? You can´t handle it.

409
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:20,584
Tod´s working now. We´ll find
a place to live somewhere.

410
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:24,422
- Hi, Garry.
- Hi.

411
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,424
- l´m moving out, Garry.
- Bye.

412
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,293
You´ve upset your brother!

413
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:32,853
Julie, l´m telling you...

414
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:37,300
if you walk out of this house,
don´t ever think about coming back.

415
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:38,802
Fine.

416
00:29:55,921 --> 00:30:00,551
Honey, l´m always here
if you need me. Sweetheart!

417
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:04,585
Honey, be careful.
lf you want anything, just call me!

418
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,799
Bye.

419
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:15,105
Oh, man!

420
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:19,376
lncredible!
Just incredible!

421
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,902
l knew you´d be the one
who´d appreciate this.

422
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:28,883
Three years, every night, every weekend,
l had dinner out here.

423
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:32,446
Yeah, it was a piece of junk
when l found it.

424
00:30:32,524 --> 00:30:35,960
First time l got laid
was in a car like this.

425
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:39,127
- Frank?
- What?

426
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:41,029
Cool just finished lunch.

427
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:43,033
l´ll call the newspaper.

428
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,764
l thought you and Larry
could take him somewhere.

429
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,468
l am showing Larry my car.

430
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:53,705
Just plop him in front of the TV.
That´s what he always does.

431
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:01,246
Wasn´t that Super Bowl incredible
right down to the last minute?

432
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,753
Amazing.

433
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:05,346
They´re usually not that close.

434
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:08,621
And usually the winning team
covers the point spread.

435
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:10,924
Usually, you can count on it.

436
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:14,022
- Take a beating?
- No, thanks. l already took one.

437
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:25,671
Anyway, l had to pay off,
and it´s left me a little--

438
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,613
- What do you need?
- Huh?

439
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:33,947
Aw, come on. Don´t insult me.
l didn´t come here to be insulted.

440
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,680
Come on.

441
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:39,815
Puttin´ together a deal, you gotta look
like you can piss with the big boys.

442
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:43,554
You see? You know.

443
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,996
How much?

444
00:31:46,832 --> 00:31:49,232
A couple thousand.
Three, tops.

445
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:52,066
- Three?
- Tops.

446
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:11,453
Good. See, Grandma,
Patty studies Eastern philosophy.

447
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:14,789
Our future leaders will have to be much
more in tune with the Oriental mind.

448
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:17,295
Okay, sweetie, one more time.

449
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:20,127
- Nathan, guess what?
- Oh, you´re home early.

450
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:23,066
- l have good news.
- What?

451
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:31,877
What´s up?

452
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:35,745
l´m going to teach summer school.
We´ll have vacation money.

453
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:37,407
Oh, that´s great.

454
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,552
Mexico.

455
00:32:44,123 --> 00:32:46,648
Gil and Karen will watch Patty.
l just want to call them.

456
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,690
Gee, honey, l´m really not too pro
on Patty spending a week with Gil.

457
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:52,992
Why not?

458
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:56,058
l´m a little concerned
about his jocularity.

459
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:57,727
He´s a wonderful guy.

460
00:32:57,804 --> 00:33:00,204
lt´s just he´s
a little lighthearted...

461
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:04,607
about things that l--
that we consider important.

462
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:08,408
She has fun over there.
You know, she scampers.

463
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:10,142
She cavorts.

464
00:33:10,216 --> 00:33:13,242
Hey, try this.
We take Patty with us.

465
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,752
To Mexico?

466
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:17,984
lt´s a perfect opportunity
to start her on Spanish.

467
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,958
lt´ll be fun.

468
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:28,126
Nathan, l thought it would be nice
if you and l could be alone.

469
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:31,432
We will be.
We´ll get two rooms.

470
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:38,401
Which one will l be in?

471
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,107
That means ''come here'' in Spanish.

472
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:47,353
Please. l want you
to listen to something.

473
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,445
l´ve got a tape
of a mariachi band.

474
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:54,084
An authentic indigenous
native Mexican form of music.

475
00:34:09,242 --> 00:34:11,608
- Gil, good morning.
- Hello, Cindy.

476
00:34:18,818 --> 00:34:20,752
When were you gonna tell me?

477
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:23,087
Tell you what?

478
00:34:23,156 --> 00:34:25,351
Lenny called this morning.

479
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:28,792
He wondered where we should take Phil
Richards to celebrate his partnership.

480
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:31,921
That Lenny is an asshole.
You believe that guy?

481
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:35,627
Nobody was supposed to have
that information until next month.

482
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:37,635
That partnership is mine.

483
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:41,161
You said when Ted got back,
you´d make it official.

484
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,836
Look, l never said you didn´t do
great work. You do terrific work.

485
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:48,346
Every firm does good work.

486
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:52,909
l know you´re smarter than Phil,
but the guy works like a Trojan.

487
00:34:52,986 --> 00:34:56,149
He schmoozes clients.
He brings in business.

488
00:34:56,223 --> 00:34:58,157
He´s here nights, weekends.

489
00:34:58,225 --> 00:35:02,218
l own the guy. And that´s
what puts your name on the door.

490
00:35:02,296 --> 00:35:05,424
This is really coming
out of left field.

491
00:35:05,499 --> 00:35:08,764
l´ve been here eight years.
l´m the backbone of the operation.

492
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:10,497
l know that.

493
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:14,837
lf l don´t get this partnership,
l gotta think about going elsewhere.

494
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:19,572
- That´s not realistic.
- Why?

495
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:21,910
You go somewhere else,
you´re gonna have to get in line...

496
00:35:21,982 --> 00:35:25,679
behind guys who are younger,
who have been there longer...

497
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:30,451
who are more committed
and are willing to work for less money.

498
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:39,424
Look, this thing with Phil
is not etched in stone.

499
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:42,934
l can jerk him along
for the next month.

500
00:35:43,003 --> 00:35:45,767
Why don´t you use that time
to give us your best shot?

501
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,273
Put in the hours.
Dazzle me.

502
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:51,209
Dazzle you?

503
00:35:57,684 --> 00:36:00,812
Listen, Dave.
l´m having a problem at home.

504
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:04,255
l really need to spend
a lot of extra time with my son.

505
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:07,020
Then l don´t know what we can do.

506
00:36:08,795 --> 00:36:11,355
Get this guy. Yeah, yeah.

507
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:18,468
Oh, well. They´re bad dudes. That´s
why they call the game ''Bad Dudes.''

508
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:20,973
l should go stay with the girls.
Got enough quarters?

509
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,208
- Dad?
- Yeah?

510
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:29,544
How come l´m seeing
a psychiatrist?

511
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,013
We were gonna have
a big talk about that.

512
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:39,217
- What´s wrong with me?
- Nothing.

513
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:41,591
- You´re great.
- Then how come--

514
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:49,634
You´re a kid like l was.
You have a lot of worries. That´s all.

515
00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:54,470
And these doctors are experts
at helping people with their worries.

516
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,634
lt´s nothing to feel bad about.

517
00:36:57,945 --> 00:37:01,176
You´re a great kid,
and l love you very much, okay?

518
00:37:06,186 --> 00:37:10,646
Hey, you know what l think?
This is gonna be a great summer for you.

519
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:13,192
And don´t forget
you got a birthday coming up.

520
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,490
Let´s have a great party.

521
00:37:15,562 --> 00:37:17,223
Can we have Cowboy Dan?

522
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:19,162
- Who?
- Cowboy Dan.

523
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:23,101
The gun-fighting balloon man.
He was at Billy´s party. He´s cool.

524
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,229
Absolutely.
lt´s a done deal.

525
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:28,001
This is your dad talking.
Now you´ve got me excited.

526
00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:32,141
Now, what do we say when we see
a cute eight-year-old girl?

527
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:33,645
Hubba-hubba.

528
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:39,845
Don´t tell your mom l taught you that.
lt could be bad. Let´s go.

529
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,615
Wow!

530
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,986
- You like it?
- Yeah.

531
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:53,465
- lt´s good. lt´s shiny.
- Yeah.

532
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:56,367
And you know,
it was junk when l found it.

533
00:37:57,538 --> 00:38:00,473
The first time l got laid
was in a car--

534
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,771
That´s a story for another time.

535
00:38:15,189 --> 00:38:17,384
Hi, Dad.
Dinner ready?

536
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,221
What was that?

537
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:24,163
Huh? Oh, some friends
who were just dropping me off.

538
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:27,633
Friends? Friends slow down.
They even stop.

539
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,698
Sweetie, you´re gonna be okay.

540
00:39:04,339 --> 00:39:06,807
Honey, why would you
be panhandling?

541
00:39:07,842 --> 00:39:10,675
l needed money
for a place to stay.

542
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:12,679
You have a place to stay.

543
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:15,648
l´d have to tell you what happened.

544
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:18,743
- What did happen?
- l don´t want to tell you.

545
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,345
- Did you leave that Tod?
- Yes.

546
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:25,854
He promised me he was gonna start
a house-painting business.

547
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:28,452
Then he said he changed his mind.

548
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:31,692
He´s gonna race dragsters
with his brothers.

549
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:34,394
He can´t even drive a regular car.

550
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:38,897
So his brothers came over,
and we got in a fight.

551
00:39:38,973 --> 00:39:43,637
He said, ''No bitch is gonna
tell me what to do for a living.''

552
00:39:46,948 --> 00:39:49,542
He told me he loved me.

553
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:51,050
Sweetie.

554
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:54,621
They say that...

555
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,684
and then they come.

556
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,729
Honey, what can you expect
from a kid like that?

557
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:06,529
Mom, back off. The last guy
you dated stole our furniture.

558
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:11,430
- Men are scum.
- l know.

559
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:15,602
l know, sweetie.
Men are scum.

560
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:31,791
- Honey, Julie´s home.
- Great.

561
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,400
Come on. Let´s go eat
lots of ice cream.

562
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:44,062
You want an ice-cream soda?

563
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:47,403
How about a hot fudge sundae?

564
00:40:47,475 --> 00:40:49,967
You want a banana split?

565
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:52,536
Do you want something
like french fries?

566
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:54,548
- Yes.
- You do?

567
00:40:57,186 --> 00:40:59,120
l thought l´d find you here.

568
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:02,089
Does that make you Sherlock Holmes?
l live here.

569
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:03,385
You live with me.

570
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:05,849
l wouldn´t live with you...

571
00:41:05,928 --> 00:41:08,453
if the world were flooded with piss
and you lived in a tree.

572
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,430
l´m going to the movies.

573
00:41:10,499 --> 00:41:13,366
You´re not leaving here
till you hear what l have to say.

574
00:41:13,435 --> 00:41:16,893
l´m not--
Let go of me!

575
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:19,202
- Let her go!
- Just listen to me.

576
00:41:19,274 --> 00:41:22,937
Let her go!
Goddamn it! Let her go!

577
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:25,275
Please, Mrs. Buckman.
l love her.

578
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:28,510
You can´t run out on me.
You´re my wife.

579
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:31,712
lf you don´t let her go,
l´m gonna call the-- His what?

580
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:38,283
His wife. We got married
a couple of days ago.

581
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,590
Are you out of your mind?

582
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,596
Please, Mrs. Buckman.

583
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:45,491
Julie, l didn´t mean it.

584
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:48,530
l´m sorry.

585
00:41:48,604 --> 00:41:52,062
My brothers were ragging on me,
and l couldn´t back down.

586
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:57,043
But last night, l told them.
They mean nothing.

587
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:00,682
You mean everything.

588
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:09,146
Christ!

589
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:11,852
Okay, look lively.
You´re doing great.

590
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:14,452
Shortstop, here it goes.
All right, pick it up.

591
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,328
Easy now, over to first.
That´s the way to play.

592
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:20,061
That´s right. You´re beautiful.

593
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:22,467
You´re a bunch of
wild, young Bohemians.

594
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:25,006
Let´s go again.
Second base, here we go.

595
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:28,065
Get down on it. Don´t be afraid.
lt can´t hurt you. Here we go.

596
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:30,134
Get down on it!

597
00:42:33,148 --> 00:42:35,616
Wayne, get Ben some ice.

598
00:42:35,684 --> 00:42:38,619
All right, we´re gonna need
a new second base man.

599
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:41,679
Which one of you outfielders
wants to try second base?

600
00:42:44,092 --> 00:42:47,152
How about you, Kevin?
You want to try second base?

601
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:51,464
All right!

602
00:42:53,535 --> 00:42:57,301
Oh, Matt, none of that.
Let´s be a team.

603
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:58,805
Get out there and hustle.

604
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,483
Remember, the word is ''fun.''

605
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:11,348
So just go on out there...

606
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,253
and what you catch you catch
and what you miss you miss.

607
00:43:14,323 --> 00:43:15,813
Okay, Dad.

608
00:43:27,302 --> 00:43:29,293
Way to go, Kevin!

609
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:47,983
And now it is my great pleasure
to introduce our valedictorian...

610
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:50,817
Kevin Buckman.

611
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,673
Thank you.

612
00:44:09,746 --> 00:44:14,149
When l was nine years old,
l had kind of a rough time.

613
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:17,152
A lot of people thought
l was pretty mixed up.

614
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,451
But there was one person
who got me through it.

615
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:22,923
He did everything right.

616
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:25,517
And thanks to him, today...

617
00:44:25,595 --> 00:44:28,928
l´m the happiest,
most confident...

618
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:32,091
and most well-adjusted person
in this world.

619
00:44:33,736 --> 00:44:36,261
Dad, l love you.

620
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:39,708
You´re the greatest.

621
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,033
All right!

622
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:11,731
One more out, guys! Let´s go!
ls your arm tired, Shaun?

623
00:45:14,343 --> 00:45:18,109
Hey, Gil, our boys
finally gonna win one game?

624
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,445
Way to be supportive, Lou.

625
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:30,749
That´s right, Kevin!

626
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:33,591
Way to go, Tommy!
All right!

627
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:36,564
We got bases loaded.
We´re only one run down.

628
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:38,566
You can do it.
Get up there.

629
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:41,527
Please, God,
let ´em win one game.

630
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,668
Got it!

631
00:46:00,957 --> 00:46:02,720
You stink, Buckman!

632
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:10,497
- He had no business being out there!
- What´s the matter with you?

633
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,831
lt´s terrible!

634
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:32,880
Why´d you make me play
second base?

635
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:54,509
Someone´s climbed to the roof
of the bell tower with a rifle!

636
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:58,810
lt´s Kevin Buckman.
His father totally screwed him up.

637
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,907
What´s he yelling?

638
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,147
You made me play second base!

639
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,849
Kevin, l´m sorry.
l did the best l could.

640
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:14,829
Nice shot, son.
lt´s important to be supportive.

641
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,332
Come on. Let´s sing
one of the old tunes.

642
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,302
When you´re sliding into home
and your pants are full of foam

643
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,803
Diarrhea

644
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,164
Well?

645
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,901
Why are you pouring water
through my diaphragm?

646
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,528
To check.

647
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,972
To see if it´s okay.
You didn´t know l did that, huh?

648
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,976
Obviously not,
or you wouldn´t have tried this.

649
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,979
Are you accusing me
of making that hole?

650
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,982
No, a woodpecker came in here,
went into the bathroom...

651
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,884
opened the drawer with his wing
and pecked holes in your diaphragm.

652
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,583
l can´t believe you would jeopardize
our plan. Remember what we read?

653
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,388
A majority of exceptional people
are either only children...

654
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,259
or firstborns
with five years between sibs.

655
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,594
- We agreed--
- No, you agreed.

656
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,692
And they´re not sibs.
They´re babies, and l want another one.

657
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:29,762
So this is how you go about it?
By vandalizing your contraception?

658
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,503
- Because you won´t discuss it!
- We discussed this years ago!

659
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,010
l think we were wrong.

660
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,172
l think we were right,
and l´m not discussing it again.

661
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,352
- Tod?
- Yeah?

662
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,116
- Do you want me to make breakfast?
- No, thanks, Helen.

663
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,716
- Julie´s gonna do it.
- l´ll get the fire extinguisher.

664
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:54,196
l´ll see you guys at dinner.
Sweet Jesus!

665
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,825
What are you doing?
Are you joining the Marines?

666
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,202
l knew you´d make
a thing out of this, Mom.

667
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,442
Just clean up the hair.

668
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,345
You ready?
Want anything to eat?

669
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,548
How long are they
gonna be living here?

670
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,557
Not much longer, l think.

671
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:28,421
l was just thinking.
lt´s getting pretty crowded here.

672
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:32,525
lt´s not so crowded. There´s a lot
more room since they shaved their heads.

673
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,738
l was just thinking...

674
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,365
maybe l could stay with Dad
for a while.

675
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,373
What?

676
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:50,520
l´ve been here a long time. Maybe
l should live with him for a while.

677
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:53,284
You wanna live with your father?

678
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:56,826
Kind of.

679
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:04,098
Have you talked to your father
about that?

680
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:10,063
No. Not yet. l thought l´d call him.

681
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:11,574
Honey...

682
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:16,539
you don´t know
your father like l do.

683
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:20,209
l don´t know him at all.
What´s his number?

684
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:30,723
He´d be at work now.

685
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:32,456
So that´s...

686
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:36,225
2-0-6...

687
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,463
5-7-9-0.

688
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:53,183
ls Dr. Lampkin there?

689
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,878
His son.

690
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:08,422
No, Dad, it´s not Joey.
lt´s Garry, your other son.

691
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:12,765
l need to ask you something.

692
00:51:12,837 --> 00:51:14,930
lt´ll just take a second.

693
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:22,704
Would it be okay
if l stay with you for a while?

694
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,108
A few months.

695
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:48,271
Shit.

696
00:51:56,881 --> 00:51:59,145
He didn´t think
it was such a good idea.

697
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:02,345
- Sweetie--
- l´ve gotta go.

698
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:34,448
When´s Cowboy Dan, the gun-fighting
balloon man, gonna be here?

699
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,783
lsn´t that him?

700
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:39,152
That´s the schmuck
who brought the horse.

701
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:43,489
- l don´t think he´s coming.
- Of course, he is. He´s a professional.

702
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:47,759
You think he wants to put a blot on
the entire balloon-bending profession?

703
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,927
Go on and have fun. We´ll have
burgers and dogs in a second.

704
00:52:51,003 --> 00:52:53,437
Let´s go watch the horse shit.

705
00:52:59,411 --> 00:53:01,379
Why don´t you play with Justin?

706
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:04,244
l don´t understand what he´s doing.

707
00:53:04,316 --> 00:53:06,614
He´s spinning.

708
00:53:06,685 --> 00:53:08,619
What for?

709
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:10,621
No reason. Just for fun.

710
00:53:12,991 --> 00:53:14,788
Doesn´t look like fun.

711
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:17,962
lt isn´t.

712
00:53:18,931 --> 00:53:20,990
You tried it?

713
00:53:27,806 --> 00:53:30,434
So does Julie have a nice place?

714
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:35,378
Yeah, she has a lovely place.
She has my place.

715
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:38,041
She and that Tod are both
living in my house.

716
00:53:38,116 --> 00:53:40,414
Really?

717
00:53:40,485 --> 00:53:43,352
Actually, it was my idea.

718
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:47,483
Otherwise, she was gonna quit school
and get a job.

719
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:51,723
Maybe this way
she´ll still go to college.

720
00:53:53,265 --> 00:53:55,460
Here we go.
The thumb trick. Ready?

721
00:53:55,534 --> 00:53:57,866
Here´s my thumb. Watch it.

722
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:06,201
- What are you doing?
- The thumb trick. Show her, Dad.

723
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:10,706
Okay, but this is the last time.
Here we go. Ready?

724
00:54:24,363 --> 00:54:27,628
l mean, Justin is gonna
go full-time next year...

725
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:32,363
so everybody´s askin´ when l´m gonna
go back to work like l´m supposed to.

726
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:36,999
And l´m thinkin´ about it.
l mean, l used to work. lt was okay.

727
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:42,172
But l think l´m better at this.
l think l´m sort of good at it, so--

728
00:54:42,247 --> 00:54:46,775
But then people make me feel embarrassed
like l don´t have goals or something.

729
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:51,789
Like l sit around here eating bonbons
all day, right? Oh, l don´t know.

730
00:54:51,857 --> 00:54:53,791
What does Gil say?

731
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:57,420
He says l should do whatever l want.
l could have killed him for that.

732
00:54:57,496 --> 00:54:59,430
What are you so upset about?

733
00:54:59,498 --> 00:55:02,763
Nathan, she´s weird.
She´s a weird child.

734
00:55:02,834 --> 00:55:05,359
l think a few days a week
of preschool could be very helpful.

735
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:08,167
This is not the right age for Patty
to be socially activated.

736
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,576
She´s not a bomb. She´s a little kid who
has no ability to relate to other kids.

737
00:55:13,645 --> 00:55:15,875
You want her to relate to him?

738
00:55:17,082 --> 00:55:18,709
Help, help, help!

739
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:22,345
When l met him, l was a little wild.

740
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:24,821
l was a little out of control.

741
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:28,053
He kind of took me in hand.

742
00:55:28,126 --> 00:55:31,960
l liked that.
He´s very commanding.

743
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:36,296
He got me into teaching.
He got my shit together.

744
00:55:36,368 --> 00:55:38,802
Boy, he really turned me on.

745
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:41,202
Really? l mean, of course, really.

746
00:55:41,273 --> 00:55:43,764
Nathan and l used to be hot.

747
00:55:43,842 --> 00:55:47,676
l know he doesn´t look it,
but we were like rabbits.

748
00:55:47,746 --> 00:55:52,013
l used to give him, you know...

749
00:55:52,085 --> 00:55:56,181
oral, you know, on the highway.

750
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:58,385
What?

751
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:01,427
He was always trying
to get a research grant.

752
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:05,795
And you thought that would help?

753
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:09,801
No, but, l mean,
he kept getting turned down.

754
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,803
He´d get real, real tense.

755
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:16,970
So if l saw him getting
really tense, l´d just...

756
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:19,876
lean over while
he was driving and l´d--

757
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,077
l just spoke to your mother. Grandmother
wants to stay at Helen´s for a while.

758
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:28,086
- Can you drive her there tomorrow?
- Sure.

759
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:47,166
He likes to butt things
with his head.

760
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:50,701
How proud you must be.

761
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:58,341
Here it is. Now it´s right there
in front of you. Be careful.

762
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:11,423
Here. Take this off.

763
00:57:12,498 --> 00:57:15,058
Now really try and hit it.

764
00:57:15,134 --> 00:57:17,534
Really give it a good shot.

765
00:57:17,603 --> 00:57:19,662
Give it a good whack!

766
00:57:20,305 --> 00:57:26,252
