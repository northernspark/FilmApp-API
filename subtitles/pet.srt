   - No.

      Go to hell.               

431
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,034
         That's the question.   

432
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,903
             <i> Which one's</i>       
             <i> the real Holly?</i>   

433

       <i> The Holly on the outside</i>
       <i> or the other Holly.</i>     

434
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:14,110
   Because if there's           
   even a chance I can save you,

435
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:15,712
           I have to take it.   

436
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:22,218
          <i> But if that's it,</i>

          <i> left to save,</i>

            What you doing here?

439
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,167
    Man, if they catch you      
    fucking around them tunnels.

440
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:41,738
  They won't catch me,          
  I'm not going in there.       

441
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,272
                Just grab a mop.

442
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:45,141
      We got that place smellin'
      like dog shit out there.  

443
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:46,476
        Shit.                   

444
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,052
        ( door rattles )        

445
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,360
   This fuckin' dude            
   is a joke.                   

446
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:10,933
Claire:<i> So...</i>                   

447
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:14,904
what are you                    
gonna do now?                   

448
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:16,372
                I'm gonna wait. 

449
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,377
            Claire:             
          <i> Good girl.</i>           

450
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,232
             Seth:              
   <i> It's a real page-turner.</i>    

451
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:50,039
  <i> You're a hell of a writer,</i>   
        <i> you know that?</i>         

452
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,541
            You're a thief.     

453
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,346
            And now what?       

454
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,549
          Suddenly, you got me  
          all figured out.      

455
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,851
     I wish. No.                

456
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:07,023
  Mostly I just felt            
  sorry for you.                

457
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:10,526
         You? Felt sorry for me?

458
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:13,996
Yeah, it's the part             
where you talk about love.      

459
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,399
  "Love is just a label         

460
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:19,202
  for our biological            
  imperatives."                 

461
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:22,605
  I don't know.                 
  Felt ignorant to me.          

462
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,074
       Are you really gonna     
       lecture me on love, Seth?

463
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,076
        You're keeping a girl   
        in a cage.              

464
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:32,181
 I think I finally              
 figured it out.                

465
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,150
 All these people               
 who talk about love            

466
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:38,054
    like it's this              
    lightning bolt from the sky.

467
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,523
        This irresistible force.

468
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,626
          So you think, well,   
          I've never felt that. 

469
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,129
            <i> But those people</i>   
            <i> are wrong.</i>         

470
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:49,131
            Love is not         
            a lightning bolt.   

471
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:52,435
Love is, real love,             

472
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:55,371
      takes work.               

473
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,306
      Sacrifice.                

474
00:47:57,308 --> 00:48:01,244
   Real love is giving          
   everything you have          
   to someone else.             

475
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:05,014
     - That's love.             
     - Fucking kidding me?      

476
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,515
     You don't think?           

477
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,651
            "Love is sacrifice"?

478
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:13,189
     You know who believes that?
     People who hate themselves.

479
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:16,926
      <i> Who are alone, depressed.</i>
      <i> Just like you.</i>           

480
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:19,095
   - You think I have myself?   
   -<i> I know you do.</i>             

481
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:21,063
      You hate yourself so much,
      you can't even imagine    

482
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:23,399
           how fucked up someone
           would have to be     
           to love you back.    

483
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,636
      <i> So you convince yourself</i> 
      <i> that love is this thing</i>  
      <i> that you can buy.</i>        

484
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:30,106
          That all you have     
          to do is keep giving. 

485
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:32,575
 Well, like I said,             
 I just feel sorry for you.     

486
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,043
           Spare me             
           the fucking pity,    

487
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:36,445
           I'm not the one      
           who's alone here.    

488
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,014
   Oh, I guess not.             

489
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:49,091
And how is Claire               
these days?                     

490
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:55,398
     What are you talking about?

491
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,701
You know, sometimes             
before I open that door,        

492
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,569
      I can heard you           
      talking in here

      what you're talking about.

497
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,014
      I know more               
      than you think.

500
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:23,492
              She's not real.   

501
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,261
    You don't think             
    I know that?                

502
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:27,697

     starting to forget

508
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,451

       One thing                
       I still don't understand.

510
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,056
             The journal.

       living there a long time 

693
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:17,339

01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,351
       -<i> Please? </i>               
       - Nate:<i> Oh, fuck.</i>        

751
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:58,720
       <i> ( Nate screams )</i>        

752
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,024
      <i> I can feel my leg.</i>       
          <i> ( screams )</i>          

753
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:07,228
      What the fuck?            

754
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:14,102
       <i> Somebody help me.</i>       
          <i> ( groans )</i>           

755
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:19,474
         - Oh, my--             
         - ( crashes )          

756
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,677
Come on, do it again.           

757
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:33,088
      One more time.            

758
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:39,260
           I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
           I'm sorry.           

759
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:42,564
Seth. You have                  
to listen to me, okay?          

760
01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:44,699
<i> You have to do</i>                 
<i> exactly what I say.</i>            

761
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:46,267
<i> Are you listening?</i>             

762
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:48,770
Okay, step one                  
is disposing of the body.       

763
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:50,372
The sooner, the better.         

764
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:52,574
<i> Okay, burn it, bury it,</i>        
<i> sink it, whatever.</i>             

765
01:06:52,576 --> 01:06:54,042
<i> Just get it out of here.</i>       

766
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:55,510
<i> But you can't do that</i>          

767
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,145
<i> before you get rid</i>             
<i> of the identifiers.</i>            

768
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:59,614
<i> Teeth, tattoos,</i>                
<i> fingerprints.</i>                  

769
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:02,517
<i> The fingerprints are easy,</i>     
<i> you can use a carob for that.</i>  

770
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,552
       <i> After the teeth,</i>        
   <i> you need to scatter them.</i>   

771
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:06,454
          <i> Dumpsters,</i>           
      <i> in water, whatever.</i>      

772
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:09,124
         <i> Just not all</i>          
      <i> in the same place.</i>       

773
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:10,625
        And then there's        
 just the body to worry about.  

774
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,531
             Seth:              
      <i> He's not gonna fit</i>       
      <i> in the incinerator.</i>      

775
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,566
             Holly:             
     <i> Well, not like that.</i>      

776
01:08:04,848 --> 01:08:06,815
        ( fire erupts )         

777
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:26,167
             Holly:             
    <i> Do you want to practice</i>    
     <i> with me what to say?</i>      

778
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,640
             Seth:              
       <i> Hey, Mrs. Gundy,</i>        
          <i> it's Seth.</i>           

779
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:35,710
  <i> Sorry to call you so late.</i>   

780
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:39,114
       Um, yeah, Nate asked me  
       to watch the front       

781
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:41,783
    while he ran some errands   
    and he's still not back yet.

782
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,352
         <i> I don't know</i>          
        <i> where he went.</i>         

783
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:47,355
              Oh...             
              Okay, good night. 

784
01:08:47,357 --> 01:08:49,357
             Sorry.             

785
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,673
     How do you feel?           

786
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,543
            I don't know.       
            Disconnected.       

787
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:43,378
      Like it happened          
      to someone else, you know?

788
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:46,414
  The first time's              
  always the worst.             

789
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:48,816
      There is no<i> first</i> time.   
      It was an accident.       

790
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:52,587
     - I told you.              
     - You know what always     
      got to me?                

791
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:54,422
    It was the questions.       

792
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:55,924
    I remember                  
    in the beginning            

793
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:59,294
  all I could think about       
  was what if she had a pet?    

794
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:03,198
  <i> It's poor little doggie</i>      
  <i> just sitting by the door</i>     

795
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,667
        <i> waiting for her</i>        
         <i> to come home.</i>         

796
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:08,203
    But all that goes away.     

797
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:09,671
       The more you think       
            about it            

798
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:12,540
     the more you remember      
   the parts that you liked.    

799
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,309
     How it made you feel.      

800
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:15,977
   <i> Like you were in control</i>    
         <i> of your life</i>          

801
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:18,613
   <i> for the very first time,</i>    
 <i> like nothing could hurt you.</i>  

802
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:19,847
     That's not how it was.     

803
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,483
But the only problem is         

804
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:24,919
that sooner or later            
it all goes back to normal.     

805
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:30,692
All of a sudden                 
you're nothing special,         
you're just you.                

806
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:32,827
          Stop, okay?           

807
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:34,696
 Holly:                         
<i> And that's when you</i>            
<i> start to wonder.</i>               

808
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:38,399
How far you'd have to go        
to get that feeling back.       

809
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,834
       It's not the same.       

810
01:10:39,836 --> 01:10:44,005
There is no shame in accepting  
what you are, Seth.             

811
01:10:44,007 --> 01:10:45,506
             I did it,          
             to keep us safe.   

812
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:46,741
             I had no choice.   

813
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,744
 Didn't you ever wonder why     

814
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:53,681
all the girls in the world      
but you get a hard on for me?   

815
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,917
<i> And you think that's, what,</i>    
<i> a coincidence?</i>                 

816
01:10:57,554 --> 01:11:00,955
You and me,                     
we were born to do this.        

817
01:11:00,957 --> 01:11:03,358
       Don't act like you know  
       a goddamn thing about me.

818
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,294
I know that a normal person     
finds a murder confession       

819
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:07,528
and goes to the police.         

820
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:08,730
   not to PetSmart.             

821
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:10,865
          Oh, yeah,             
          "Excuse me, Officer.  

822
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:13,034
       You see that girl        
       over there, the waitress?
       She's Hannibal Lecter.   

823
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:15,637
    <i> You know how I know?</i>       
    <i> I broke into her apartment</i> 
    <i> and stole her shit."</i>       

824
01:11:15,639 --> 01:11:17,005
          <i> Think that'll work?</i>  

825
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:18,906
   Oh, and so plan B            
   is kidnapping?               

826
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,742
             'Cause the fucking 
             alternative        

827
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,844
             was sitting around 
             watching you hurt  
             someone else.      

828
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:25,780
         Mm.                    

829
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:28,750
    Good thing                  
    no one got hurt.            

830
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:32,453
                 I told you...  
                 I told you.    

831
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,521
               It's an accident.

832
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:36,057
     Face it, Seth.             

833
01:11:36,059 --> 01:11:39,794
    This was never              
    about saving lives,         
    you like this.              

834
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:42,463
    You like having             
    that kind of power.         

835

837
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:52,540

                I can save you. 

839

Maybe you're not                
supposed to save me.            

840
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,623

841
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:13,895
                  Don't, don't. 

842
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:33,948
Seth, please help me,           
I'm so cold.

01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,149
                      Yes.      

858
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:44,419
When's the last time            
you saw him?                    

859
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,521
          Wednesday, I think?   
          Wednesday evening.    

860
01:13:46,523 --> 01:13:47,755
          Yeah, he asked me     
          to cover the front    

861
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,190
                   while he ran 
                   some errands.

862
01:13:49,192 --> 01:13:53,094
    - What kind of errands?     
    - Um, he didn't say.        

863
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:55,930
    Uh-huh. And this            
    would be about...           

864
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,965
       what time?               

865
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,967
           9:00, 10:00.         
           Something like that. 

866
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:02,937
He leave out                    
through the front?              

867
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,505
                  Yeah.         

868
01:14:04,507 --> 01:14:06,741
The front door,                 
you sure?                       

869
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:08,609
                Yeah, why?      

870
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:09,977
Well, here's the thing.         

871
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:14,015
The front door operates         
on a keyless entry system.      

872
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:17,985
As you know, it records         
each instance in or out.        

873
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:22,590
Now you wanna guess             
the last time someone           
opened that door?               

874
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:25,493
4:00.                           
That's 4:00 AM.                 

875
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:27,762
  - Huh.                        
  -<i> And you said it was what,</i>   
  <i> </i> 9:00 or 10:00PM?            

876
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,163
It's kind of weird,             
don't you think?                

877
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:31,065
              No, maybe         
              I'm remembering   
              it wrong.         

878
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:34,969
              He could have left
              out the side door,
              or loading docks. 

879
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:38,706
   Loading docks?               
   Oh, sure. Yeah.              

880
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:39,974
        I should check that out.

881
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:44,479
You and Nathan friends?         

882
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:46,581
       Well, we worked together.
      He was a nice guy and all.

883
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:48,182
   Until he tried               
   to get you fired.            

884
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:50,551
      What? Oh.                 
      That is not what happened.

885
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:51,686
                Nate and I      
                were friends.   

886
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,588
Oh, now                         
you're friends again.           

887
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:56,090
Or you were friends,            
past tense.                     

888
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:58,593
That's the second time          
you said that.                  

889
01:14:58,595 --> 01:14:59,994
   Well, you know               
   what they say.               

890
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:03,731
First time 's confusion,        
second time's confession.       

891
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:04,899
              What's this about?

892
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:06,734
Standard procedure.             

893
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:08,903
So now, he asked you            
to cover for him,               

894
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:11,639
this is what Wednesday night,   
nine or ten?                    

895
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:13,007
Did he say                      
where he was going?             

896
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,041
             I think he had     
             to meet someone.   

897
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:16,143
            He got a phone call,
            something.          

898
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:19,981
It's funny, because             
the first thing we did          

899
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:21,749
was check                       
the phone records.              

900
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:25,253
And the last person he          
talked to was his girlfriend.   

901
01:15:25,255 --> 01:15:27,255
  5:32 that afternoon.          

902
01:16:28,318 --> 01:16:30,284
                         Hi.    

903
01:16:35,325 --> 01:16:37,959
            Gotta eat something.

904
01:16:42,165 --> 01:16:46,267
                <i> Holly, come on.</i>

905
01:16:48,638 --> 01:16:52,139
        <i> Come on.</i>               
        <i> Come on, don't do this.</i>

906
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:23,371
             Seth:              
        <i> Now I know what</i>        
         <i> you're doing.</i>         

907
01:17:23,373 --> 01:17:26,273
     <i> It's not gonna work.</i>      

908
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:31,045
   <i> Just talk to me, please.</i>    

909
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,754
                Holly:          
               <i> It's over, Seth.</i>

910
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:44,659
I don't understand.             

911
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,895
              <i> Because if you</i>   
              <i> can't help me</i>    

912
01:17:47,897 --> 01:17:51,799
   if you can't give me         
   what I need, then no one can.

913
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:57,772
   Tell me,                     
   tell me what you need.       

914
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:02,877
            You know the answer.

915
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:06,447
            You put me in a box.

916
01:18:06,449 --> 01:18:09,316
              That's not love,  
              that's ownership. 

917
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:15,856
             <i> You didn't</i>        
             <i> give me anything.</i> 

918
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:21,195
          <i> All you did was take.</i>

919
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,764
I can't let you out.            

920
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:27,702
     -<i> You know that. </i>          
     - I didn't ask you to.     

921
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:29,403
Then what?                      
What do you want?               

922
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:36,844
                      Proof.    

923
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:40,981
        Proof?                  

924
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:45,920
          - A finger.           
          - A what?             

925
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:47,188
      A finger?                 

926
01:18:50,493 --> 01:18:52,059
      My finger?                

927
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:00,768
        No.                     

928
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,739
  <i> No. No. No. No.</i>              

929
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:06,874
   This is fucked.              

930
01:19:06,876 --> 01:19:08,976
  Can't you see that?           

931
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:12,346
This is totally fucked.         

932
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:15,883
   No. I'm trying               
   to save you here.            

933
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:17,418
                 And I'm trying 
                 to let you.    

934
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:20,020
<i> Well, you can't</i>                
<i> ask me for that, Holly.</i>        

935
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:21,489
<i> And I'm not gonna do it.</i>       

936
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:28,462
          I used to think       
          I was the only one.   

937
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:33,968
          Even when I was a kid,
          I still knew.         

938
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,236
              That if they      
              ever found out,   

939
01:19:35,238 --> 01:19:39,306
              my family,        
              my friends...     

940
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:42,309
 If they knew what I really was,
 they'd run the other way.      

941
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:49,083
          And so you learn to...

942
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:54,789
           blend in, to fake it.

943
01:19:57,393 --> 01:20:00,528
               <i> After a while,</i>  

944
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:04,832
     <i> you don't even notice</i>     
     <i> how lonely you really are.</i>

945
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:12,439
                   But then...  

946
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,477
            someone comes along,

947
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:17,945
             someone like you.  

948
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:25,286
           Even if he just      
           doesn't know it yet. 

949
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:29,190
           And all of a sudden, 

950
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:33,060
           you start thinking,  

951
01:20:33,062 --> 01:20:35,196
           maybe it doesn't     
           have to be this way. 

952
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:39,834
             <i> Maybe I don't</i>     
             <i> have to be alone.</i> 

953
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:44,038
               And so let go    
               of the rope.     

954
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:49,844
    Because this person,        
    he's not gonna let you fall.

955
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:52,346
          <i> He's gonna catch you.</i>
          <i> You know it.</i>         

956
01:20:58,054 --> 01:21:01,055
        At least that's what you
        keep telling yourself.  

957
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:05,893
            The whole way down. 

958
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:26,580
             Don't come back.   

959
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,316
               If that's all    
               I am to you,     

960
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:30,618
             if I'm just a pet. 

961
01:21:33,322 --> 01:21:35,055
              Then don't        
              come back for me. 

962
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:38,959
        <i> Don't come back for me.</i>

963
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:58,679
       <i> ( dogs whining )</i>        

964
01:24:11,647 --> 01:24:15,549
          If I do this

965
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:17,751
      then you'll believe?      

966

          Yes.

01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,069
          This is wrong.

01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:36,670
Seth, you love me.              

969
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:39,373
 There is nothing               
 more right than that.

977
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:14,608
    - What are you doing?       
    - Open the fucking door.    

978
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,110
You're already down             
a finger, Seth.

01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:17,578
How much more
