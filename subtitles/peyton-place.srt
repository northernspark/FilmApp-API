<i>My name is Allison MacKenzie.</i>

3
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:42,531
<i>Where I was born, time was told</i>
<i>not by the clock orthe calendar...</i>

4
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,834
<i>but by the seasons.</i>

5
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:47,534
<i>Summer was carefree contentment.</i>

6
00:02:48,714 --> 00:02:51,979
<i>Autumn was that</i>
<i>bitter-sweet time of regret...</i>

7
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:55,745
<i>for moments that had ended</i>
<i>and things that were yet undone.</i>

8
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,781
<i>And then winter fell...</i>

9
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,982
<i>with a cold mantle</i>
<i>of caution and chill.</i>

10
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:05,494
<i>It nipped our noses</i>
<i>and our arrogance...</i>

11
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:10,862
<i>and made us move closerto the</i>
<i>warm stoves of memory and desire.</i>

12
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:13,694
<i>Springwas promise.</i>

13
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:17,306
<i>But there was</i>
<i>a fifth season of love.</i>

14
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:22,445
<i>And only the wise orthe lucky</i>
<i>ones knew where to find it.</i>

15
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:47,728
Hey, mister!
Which way to Peyton Place?

16
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:51,767
Go right up this road about 2 miles,
you'll come right inside the town.

17
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,036
Thanks!

18
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,952
Lucas stole my money and he'll do it
again. He drinks everything in sight.

19
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,595
l spent a year and a half saving
for a correspondence course.

20
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,425
Don't go, Paul.
You were my first born.

21
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,567
Hitting everybody who doesn't
agree with him. Even you!

22
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:53,670
-Only when he's drinking.
-Lately, that's been every night.

23
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:55,429
What did you marry him for?

24
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,542
When your pa died, you, Selena and
Joey had to have some kind of father.

25
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:02,338
Lucas tries hard to be a good man.

26
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:05,876
-Good-bye, mom.
-Paul!

27
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:08,514
Selena, don't you ask me to stay.

28
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,814
My baby-sitting money.
l wish there was more.

29
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:14,454
Paul!

30
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,220
Paul, I'll do extra work.
I'll find a job and...

31
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,627
get the money back.
Only don't leave.

32
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,236
I'm sorry we got into a fight.

33
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:28,998
It won't happen again.
l give you my word.

34
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,437
Paul!

35
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:43,481
He'll come back. You wait
and see. He'll come back.

36
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:54,731
Nellie, I'm... I'm going to try hard
not to drink anymore.

37
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,696
Selena...

38
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:03,406
I'm going to try harder
than I ever tried anything.

39
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:26,589
-Morning!
-Good morning.

40
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,658
May I have a couple of fried eggs
and a cup of coffee, please?

41
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,351
-All right.
-Do you have a washing room...

42
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:33,121
where I can clean up and shave?

43
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:35,822
-First door.
-Oh, yeah. Thank you.

44
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:39,197
-What are you selling?
-Nothing.

45
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:41,598
Sorry. Thought you might
be a traveling man.

46
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:44,297
No. I came here to get a job.

47
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,975
l should've known.

48
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,272
l hear that Harrington Woolen Mills
got some big government contracts...

49
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:52,109
for military uniforms cloth.

50
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:56,781
-Lot of people'll be moving in here.
-Which way is it to Harrington Mills?

51
00:07:56,988 --> 00:08:00,981
Follow Elm Street to the river,
then look up to your right.

52
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:03,884
You'll hate it!

53
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,914
-Morning, Mrs. MacKenzie.
-Morning, Nellie.

54
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:36,625
-Paul left this morning.
-Left for where?

55
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:40,730
Don't know. He wants to get out of
here and make something of himseIf...

56
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,901
instead of working
all the time at the mill.

57
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:46,570
-He wants to see the world.
-Who's going to see the world?

58
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:49,831
-Paul.
-He left town this morning.

59
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,441
Allison, must you play records at
a quarter to eight in the morning?

60
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:56,740
Good breakfast music.
Digest your orange juice with cuIture.

61
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:59,940
I'm glad about Paul, Nellie.
How did Selena take it?

62
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:03,518
She's glad too, but she ain't
a mother. Neither are you.

63
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:07,122
I'd like to see the world,
have a romance in Venice...

64
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:09,418
meet a tall dark stranger
in Hong Kong.

65
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,959
-Allison, don't eat so fast.
-Have to.

66
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:15,030
Senior class is giving
a gift to Miss Thornton.

67
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,861
And I wrote a speech that
Rodney Harrington is going to read.

68
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:20,401
-Badly, I'm sure.
-What's going on?

69
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,165
School board's meeting to appoint
a new principal. Mr. Firth died.

70
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:24,841
How do you know they'll give it
to Miss Thornton?

71
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:26,977
They have to. There's nobody else
who deserves it.

72
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:29,510
I'll drop by the store
after school.

73
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,876
Good-bye, dad.

74
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:37,350
l wish you'd stop that ridiculous
performance every day.

75
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:40,388
What? Saying good-bye
and hello to my father?

76
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:41,991
Saying it to a photograph.

77
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:45,792
l suppose it's silly, but it makes
me feel that he's here with us.

78
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:50,491
-But you scarcely knew your father.
-Not my fault he died when I was 2.

79
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:52,793
l can't even remember him,
l admit, but I miss him.

80
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:56,030
You mean you miss a father?

81
00:09:56,241 --> 00:10:00,075
Yes, mother. Wouldn't it be nice
if you had some man friends...

82
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:02,746
or some dates,
or even married again?

83
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:05,848
Will you stop talking about fathers,
and husbands, and marriage?

84
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:08,915
You miss him more
than I ever realized.

85
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,350
I'm sorry, mother.

86
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:13,421
I'll be late.

87
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:19,361
Forgot the speech.

88
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,532
-Good-bye, mom.
-Good-bye.

89
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,517
-Good morning, Miss Lindsay.
-Morning, Allison.

90
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:44,144
Hi, David.

91
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:52,385
-Good morning, Mr. Herman.
-Good Morning, Mrs. Allison.

92
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,199
Go home, Duff!

93
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,950
-Hi, Doc Swain.
-Good morning, Allison.

94
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:24,086
-Good morning, girls.
-Good morning, doctor.

95
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:41,771
-Good morning, Mr. Cross.
-Good morning.

96
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:48,285
Thank you, Norman. Everything's
gone wrong this morning.

97
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:50,420
If you didn't run all the time...

98
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:57,723
Ted's bringing the gift!

99
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:07,627
Rod! Excuse me.
Here's the speech.

100
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:11,807
-I'll never memorize this.
-Well, just read it.

101
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:15,371
She's coming!
Miss Thornton's coming!

102
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:20,813
"...the job of principal
of Peyton Place High School."

103
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:28,752
Quiet!

104
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:35,323
Miss Thornton...

105
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:38,058
the members of the senior class
have asked me to say a few words...

106
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:41,204
and, on behalf of them,
to present this gift to you.

107
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,842
The names of all of us are inscribed
inside the cover of that dictionary.

108
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,382
Because there are so many different
words that might express...

109
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,416
what we feel
in our hearts for you...

110
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,283
and your long services
to Peyton Place High School...

111
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,755
we decided to give you
all the words in the language.

112
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:06,795
We're going to lose you, but to
something bigger and more important:

113
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:09,761
the job of principal
of Peyton Place High School.

114
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,992
So that you know
we'll never forget...

115
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:16,469
you can turn to the words "love",
"friendship" and "remembrance"...

116
00:13:16,674 --> 00:13:19,199
and know that we're always
thinking of them.

117
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:31,053
This is the loveliest thing
that ever happened to me.

118
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:34,014
l...

119
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:40,061
There's another word in this book:

120
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:42,562
"gratitude".

121
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:46,229
Now, let's talk about graduation.

122
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:51,636
I'd like to have a report from the
president of the class, Ted Carter.

123
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:55,404
Okay. Miss Thornton, l've arranged
for all the necessary committees...

124
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:59,014
and if they all do their jobs, I'm
sure we'll have a fine graduation.

125
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:03,687
Vice-president, Selena Cross?

126
00:14:03,888 --> 00:14:06,413
The programs will be printed
in a couple of weeks...

127
00:14:06,624 --> 00:14:09,957
and l've rented caps and
gowns at US$ 2.5O a piece.

128
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:13,756
We're going to have a tea and
reception on the lawn afterwards.

129
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:18,428
Editor of the yearbook,
Allison MacKenzie.

130
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:19,762
The copies are all done...

131
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:23,236
but the engraver's going mad waiting
for all the pictures to come in.

132
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:27,605
Who doesn't have a picture by
Wednesday won't be in the yearbook.

133
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:32,345
Senior dance, Betty Anderson.

134
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:36,743
Everybody has to help
with the decorations.

135
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:40,287
The tickets are printed and
will go on sale a week before.

136
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:46,058
I'm supposed to announce there's
to be no necking in the parking lot.

137
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:51,199
Nor anywhere else,
for that matter.

138
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:09,449
Harrington, Elsie Thornton has
earned the right to be principal.

139
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:13,055
She's given her life to this town!
The least we can do is recognize it!

140
00:15:13,257 --> 00:15:17,523
Doc, as head of the school board,
is my opinion she should be retired.

141
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,128
I'm afraid I can't quite
concur with you, Leslie.

142
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:22,799
-I agree with Doc Swain.
-You would.

143
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,991
Miss Thornton is practically senile.

144
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:28,468
She's hypochondriac,
uses sleeping pills all the time.

145
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:30,300
You want a drug addict
for a principal?

146
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:34,569
It seems to me that I write a lot of
prescriptions for you every year!

147
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,976
And as far as Miss Thornton being
senile, she's of your generation.

148
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:41,345
-She's not. I'm 36.
-You're 45!

149
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:44,544
My father delivered you the year
they buiIt the Courthouse: 1896.

150
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:46,723
We need someone young.
This fellow who's coming...

151
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:50,587
is the resuIt of correspondence
with five teaching agencies, and...

152
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:54,356
...l can get him at the right price.
-Mr. Harrington, he's outside.

153
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:58,390
He can't do us much good
out there, Miss CoIton. Send him in.

154
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:02,832
-Would you come in, Mr. Rossi?
-Yes. Thank you.

155
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,864
Good morning.

156
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:06,634
-I'm Leslie Harrington.
-How do you do?

157
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:09,312
This is the school board.
Mr. and Mrs. Partridge.

158
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:10,776
-How do you do?
-He's a lawyer.

159
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:12,472
-Dr. Swain.
-Doctor.

160
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:15,982
Seth Bushwell, editor of the "Peyton
Place Times". Please, sit down.

161
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:19,179
Now, Mr. Rossi,
here's our situation.

162
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,450
We're prepared to offer the job
as principal to a qualified man...

163
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,754
with a minimum guaranteed
five-year contract.

164
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:30,662
Mr. Rossi is a graduate from
Penn State, "suma cum laudi".

165
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:33,598
He holds a master's degree
in English and Literature.

166
00:16:33,804 --> 00:16:37,035
He was an outstanding athlete.
He's single.

167
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:40,301
Personally, now that
l've seen him, I like what I see.

168
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:41,500
Did I miss anything?

169
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:43,703
Only that l've been working
for a construction company.

170
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,543
If you're a teacher, why were you
working for a construction company?

171
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:49,815
l couldn't live on the salary
l was being paid as a teacher.

172
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:53,149
This job starts
at US$ 3,OOO a year.

173
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:56,159
Then we're all wasting our time.

174
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,659
That's US$ 5 a week more than I was
making as a teacher, Mr. Harrington.

175
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:03,698
But this offers you security,
a long-term contract.

176
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:06,461
Guaranteed poverty
is not security!

177
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:09,936
l want US$ 5,OOO a year, and a raise
of US$ 5OO on the second year.

178
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:12,868
-We can't do it.
-You own this mill.

179
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:15,102
How much do you pay a foreman?
About US$ 2OO a week?

180
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:19,176
This is business. These men
manufacture products that make money.

181
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,283
You must be practical
and face realities.

182
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:24,544
To people like you, education
is just a necessary evil.

183
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,620
You can't see it,
so it's worth nothing.

184
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:28,382
Well, let me tell you this,
Mr. Harrington:

185
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:32,620
the things we can't see are the
most important things on this Earth.

186
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,732
They're called ideas. Thank you
very much for the interview.

187
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:40,028
If we offered you US$ 5,OOO
would you coach...

188
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:43,673
...the basketball and football teams?
-No, I would not!

189
00:17:43,874 --> 00:17:46,604
ln a town like this, if you can't afford
to pay the principal of your school...

190
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:48,574
a decent salary you have
no right to run the school...

191
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,613
...much less send your children to it.
-Mr. Rossi!

192
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:57,015
Leslie, I'm afraid you're
fighting a losing battle.

193
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:59,019
Now, Mr. Rossi, frankly...

194
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,152
"...the life history of the race...

195
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:06,228
repeats itseIf in the individual."

196
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:13,566
-A notice from the school board.
-Thank you.

197
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,737
"Effective immediately:

198
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:21,105
The school board of Peyton Place
is happy to announce...

199
00:18:21,312 --> 00:18:24,475
the appointment
of a new school principal...

200
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:27,809
Mr. Michael Rossi."

201
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,844
Who?

202
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:34,889
"We trust that you will show him
the same loyaIty and devotion...

203
00:18:35,092 --> 00:18:38,186
you displayed
to the late Mr. Firth."

204
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,565
Class dismissed.

205
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:57,740
I'm sorry, Miss Thornton.

206
00:18:57,948 --> 00:18:59,813
l don't know how
they could do such a thing.

207
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:02,952
You should be principal,
you deserved it.

208
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:09,153
Allison, a person doesn't always get
what she deserves. Remember it.

209
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,529
If there's anything in life
you want, go and get it.

210
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,166
Don't wait for anybody
to give it to you.

211
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,770
Now, I have some work to do.

212
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:40,552
See you later, Al.

213
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,994
-Well, here we are.
-Good-looking school, Doc.

214
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:49,357
That must be
the new principal, you know?

215
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:55,605
They really gave it to you,
didn't they?

216
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,300
Everybody else in this town,
they really gave it to you!

217
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,943
Have you been drinking?

218
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:03,978
You work yourseIf to death for them,
they bring in an outsider...

219
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:08,049
...to pick the plum off the tree.
-You have been drinking.

220
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:11,081
l've known for a long time
you kept a bottle in the basement...

221
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:14,121
but I won't have you bring it
to the classroom ever!

222
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:16,190
-Now don't forget that.
-Might do your kids more good...

223
00:20:16,393 --> 00:20:20,090
to learn how to handle a bottle of
liquor instead of algebra problem.

224
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:23,664
-You're talking like a fool!
-Oh, be l?

225
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:27,993
l sat in this classroom 4 years!

226
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,805
l sat right here!

227
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:37,206
Everything that was important to me
was learned somewhere else.

228
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:41,373
You never applied yourseIf. You
might have learned something here.

229
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:44,050
Tell that to my wife,
the cleaning woman...

230
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,917
tell that to me, a janitor,
cleaning toilets for a living!

231
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:48,751
-Stop it!
-Tell that to every mill worker...

232
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,257
...behind in his bills.
-I said stop it!

233
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:55,455
If you had applied yourseIf you might
have learned how to live intelligently.

234
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:00,228
There isn't nobody in this here
town living intelligently. Nobody!

235
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:03,497
-I don't believe that.
-All right!

236
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:08,678
Name me one important person
graduated from this school. One!

237
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,608
You can't.

238
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:12,942
l want to tell you something,
Miss Thornton...

239
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,618
something you can teach
your class someday.

240
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:21,789
The minute they walk out that door,
they walk into a doggie-dog world.

241
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:26,793
It's crawl in front of the big dogs
if you want to eat, get a job!

242
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:30,498
l won't do it.
l won't do it!

243
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:35,735
That's why I'm washing windows,
scrubbing walls, emptying ashes.

244
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:43,339
l never had nothing I ever wanted.

245
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,440
Shakespeare didn't do me
more good than did...

246
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,087
...Washington crossing the Delaware!
-You didn't help yourseIf!

247
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,822
Elsie, I'd like to have you
meet Mike Rossi. Miss Thornton.

248
00:21:57,027 --> 00:22:00,827
-Hello, Miss Thornton.
-Mr. Rossi, welcome to Peyton Place.

249
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:04,262
-Thank you.
-Our utility man, Lucas Cross.

250
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:07,301
-Hello, Lucas.
-My hand is too dirty.

251
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:10,363
I'll start in another room.

252
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,271
-ls he always drinking?
-He's disappointed for me.

253
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,812
Loyalty is always
more passion than reason.

254
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:21,584
l guess that's why
l came to see you first.

255
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:24,253
There's strong sentiment
for making you principal.

256
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:28,915
Please, don't feel uncomfortable,
Mr. Rossi. My time came too late.

257
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:32,755
-I hope we can work together.
-Of course we can.

258
00:22:32,963 --> 00:22:36,023
l suppose you have a lot
of new progressive ideas.

259
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:40,226
No, not really. I'm rather
old-fashioned, as a matter of fact.

260
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:42,530
l have just two rules.

261
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:46,773
First, I want this school to teach
the truth, as far as we know it.

262
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:49,707
l don't want any teacher
making a fairy tale out of life.

263
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:54,112
It's hard enough as it is without
being unequipped to meet it.

264
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:56,582
That's a good rule.

265
00:22:57,054 --> 00:22:59,352
Shall we sit down?

266
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:02,048
And rule two:

267
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:06,093
teach a minimum of facts
and a maximum of ideas.

268
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:10,734
Our job is teaching to think, not
memorizing for a couple of weeks.

269
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:12,731
If war comes first...

270
00:23:12,937 --> 00:23:15,906
these kids shouldn't fight
just for historical dates, but...

271
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:19,007
for the ideals behind them.

272
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,043
l like your rules, Mr. Rossi.

273
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,839
Peyton Place is very fortunate.

274
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:30,810
Thank you, Miss Thornton.

275
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:41,029
Allison, I don't know what Betty
is buying, but tell her to hurry up.

276
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:43,199
Okay.

277
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:51,773
Mother... Miss Thornton
didn't get the job.

278
00:23:51,976 --> 00:23:55,173
l know. Betty Anderson and
Margie told me. They're in the back.

279
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,210
After giving her the gift
and the speech...

280
00:23:57,414 --> 00:23:59,644
It must have been terribly
embarrassing and tragic for her.

281
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,819
-Well, she'll get over it.
-I'm glad I'm graduating.

282
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,181
l don't want to have anything
to do with the new principal.

283
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,789
Mrs. MacKenzie,
about the graduation...

284
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:11,655
-What about it, Selena?
-My mother needs a new dress.

285
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:14,592
ls there some arrangement I could
make with you to buy her a new one?

286
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,131
After graduation, I'll get a full
time job, and I can pay you back.

287
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:20,530
Well, you'll be needing
a new dress yourseIf.

288
00:24:20,738 --> 00:24:22,729
l can get by.

289
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:27,872
Look, with Easter and the graduation
coming on, I'll need some help.

290
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:30,808
How would you like to work here
afternoons and Saturdays?

291
00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:33,210
-Oh, I'd love to!
-Fine.

292
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,250
-Then, I can buy two dresses!
-Wholesale.

293
00:24:36,553 --> 00:24:39,545
Oh, gee! No girl ever had two
better friends than you and Allison.

294
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:42,419
When you see how hard mother
makes you work, you won't say that.

295
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:48,753
-Rodney is outside.
-Good, let him wait.

296
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:51,093
Aren't you afraid you'll be
arrested wearing that thing?

297
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:52,563
No, just picked up.

298
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,034
Mother says women
should be mysterious.

299
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:58,436
-You think this dress is too old?
-No, you're just too young.

300
00:24:58,642 --> 00:25:01,110
Aren't you afraid people
will think you're a little fast?

301
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:06,112
According to my philosophy, what
people think will not pay the rent.

302
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,511
So, if you're accused of being fast,
you might as well run.

303
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:10,812
That way, you get to
all the good things first.

304
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:15,291
Just remember men can see
much better than they can think.

305
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:18,757
Believe me: a low cut neck-line
does more for a girl's future...

306
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:21,658
than the entire
Britannica Encyclopedia.

307
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:25,665
-Allison, could you help me a moment?
-Sure.

308
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:29,038
-Be right back.
-Do you think Rod will like it?

309
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:37,143
When you have your 18th birthday
party, I don't want you to invite...

310
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:40,214
...Betty Anderson.
-Then I might as well not have a party.

311
00:25:40,517 --> 00:25:42,747
If I can't invite Betty,
Rodney Harrington won't come.

312
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:45,922
-I wouldn't mind that at all.
-Then his friends won't come...

313
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:49,286
...and, pretty soon, nobody will accept.
-I can't understand why you want...

314
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:51,120
...to be friends with a girl like Betty.
-Mother...

315
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:52,955
l don't like the way
she talks about men!

316
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:54,152
-Mother...
-And sex!

317
00:25:54,364 --> 00:25:56,229
The only perfect individual
in Peyton Place is you!

318
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,598
And we've had 17 dull
birthday parties alone.

319
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:02,863
Could you let me have
one for myseIf, please?

320
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:07,807
Hey, Allison!
What about Betty?

321
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:20,381
-Hi, Norman.
-Oh, hi, Allison.

322
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,653
What's the matter?

323
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,593
Same old thing.

324
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:31,767
Grown-ups who act like children.

325
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:34,237
Could I walk home with you?

326
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,463
No, it's out of your way.
Besides, you'd get home late.

327
00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:39,198
You mean your mother
wouldn't like it.

328
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,435
-Well...
-Come on, Norman. Come on!

329
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:47,181
Did you spend the afternoon
in the library again?

330
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:49,443
Yeah.

331
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:53,188
Isn't it awfully dull going
there every day?

332
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:55,615
Yeah.

333
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:58,420
Oh? Then why do you do it?

334
00:26:59,363 --> 00:27:03,299
l like books.
Good place to do my homework.

335
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,469
Besides, where else
could I go, but home?

336
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:11,098
Go down to the water,
sit in the square...

337
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:13,902
take a walk in the woods.

338
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:15,703
l can't.

339
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,275
You know, that was a nice piece
that you wrote for Miss Thornton.

340
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:22,448
I'm sorry I did it now.

341
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:26,316
Why didn't you read it yourseIf
instead of letting Harrington do it?

342
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:28,616
Because I was afraid I'd cry.

343
00:27:28,825 --> 00:27:33,091
l still might cry when I think of
Miss Thornton not getting that job.

344
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:36,725
You know, you might just
turn out to be a great writer.

345
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:39,494
Norman, I hope so.

346
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:41,728
You know,
every time I touch a book...

347
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:43,429
l read a story...

348
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,234
or even when I just
open the dictionary...

349
00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:49,742
something inside
of me goes "thump".

350
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:52,379
And my heart starts pounding...

351
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,813
and my stomach...

352
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:00,146
It's how people are supposed
to feel when they fall in love.

353
00:28:00,557 --> 00:28:03,287
Of course, I never have.

354
00:28:04,094 --> 00:28:08,224
l wish I could be sure
of what I wanted to do.

355
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:10,662
You must have some idea.

356
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:13,829
No.

357
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:17,469
No, I thought of everything,
but nothing seems to fit me.

358
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:20,404
Maybe I'll be unique
and retire at the age of 18.

359
00:28:20,611 --> 00:28:23,011
Norman, it's about time
you got home!

360
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:25,477
Hello, Mrs. Paige!

361
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:29,118
-Bye, Norman.
-Wait just a minute, will you?

362
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,549
-But...
-I don't want to go in just yet.

363
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:35,350
Oh, Norman, what an awful thing
hating to go home.

364
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,958
Come on in here.

365
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:42,391
Well, thanks for walking with me.

366
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,898
l enjoyed it really.
Good-bye.

367
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:49,271
Good-bye.

368
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:58,613
-May I walk on it, Nellie?
-Sure. It's dry by now.

369
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:02,646
-Your mother wants you to call her.
-I really don't feel like it.

370
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,314
-You two had a fight again?
-Same fight, different round.

371
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:10,422
-Nellie?
-Yeah?

372
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:15,064
You've been both a daughter
and a mother. Which one is worse?

373
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:18,061
-Being a mother.
-Why?

374
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:23,001
You find yourseIf doing the same
things you hated your parents doing.

375
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,333
That's very interesting.

376
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,840
Somewhere along the line,
doesn't someone get intelligent...

377
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:30,343
and realize that your children
have to grow up their own way?

378
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:34,011
The mind's got nothing to
do with it. It's the feelings.

379
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:36,013
Kids get born...

380
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:40,178
and you just worry about it
and you hope for them.

381
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:43,926
Well, I got to get going.

382
00:29:44,795 --> 00:29:47,787
-Good night, Nellie.
-Good night, Allison.

383
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:47,219
Hello?
Hello, mother.

384
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:49,722
l just wanted to tell you
l've been thinking it over...

385
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:52,417
and you can invite anyone you
want for your birthday party.

386
00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:56,087
Oh, mother, thank you!
Thank you very much.

387
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:00,292
I'll be home in a little while.
Bye.

388
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:09,937
2676J, please.

389
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:26,919
Hey, watch where you're
going there, buddy, will you?

390
00:31:27,864 --> 00:31:29,832
-Thanks much.
-Thank you.

391
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:33,330
Right now, I want it.
l want some!

392
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:39,339
-Would you like a sandwich, Norman?
-No, thank you.

393
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,442
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

394
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:52,049
-Happy birthday, Allison. Hi!
-Hi, how are you?

395
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:54,516
-Betty and Rodney!
-Where's Ted Carter?

396
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:56,123
Right here.

397
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,522
Let's take that corny music off and
get down to some serious dancing.

398
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:01,287
-That's a good record.
-Yeah, that's a new one.

399
00:32:01,498 --> 00:32:03,523
-How about a sandwich?
-I brought some mistletoe.

400
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:06,133
-Mistletoe?!
-Matt, hang it high, will you, boy.

401
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:09,430
-Only if I can kiss Betty Anderson!
-Nobody's safe with me here.

402
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:11,732
Mistletoe?
Christmas is 8 months away.

403
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:14,536
Yeah, and I believe in doing
my Christmas kissing early!

404
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:17,742
-Where's the punch?
-Over there, Rodney.

405
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:20,007
-Good, I'm really thirsty.
-The old family formula.

406
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:23,050
-Now you're talking, Rod.
-Rodney, we can't do that.

407
00:32:23,253 --> 00:32:24,845
-My mother wouldn't want...
-Don't tell she's here!

408
00:32:25,055 --> 00:32:26,989
-No, she's at the movies.
-Great!

409
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,956
-Put the booze in the bowl!
-Come on, she made me promise.

410
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:32,958
Come on, Allison, you want
to have a party or not?

411
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:35,961
-You can't fight city hall.
-Don't! Put the liquor in the bowl!

412
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:39,693
Allison, forget it. I know 1O other
ways to make a party successful.

413
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:41,768
Now, first...

414
00:32:41,972 --> 00:32:43,940
we got to make the atmosphere
a little more intimate.

415
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,973
Oh, Rodney, aren't you the one?

416
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:26,574
-Evening.
-Good evening. Hello, Doc.

417
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:28,648
Hi, Connie.

418
00:33:28,852 --> 00:33:31,218
-Just coffee, please.
-Right.

419
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:33,480
Who's that, Doc?

420
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:36,317
She's Mrs. MacKenzie.
She runs a dress shop.

421
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:39,620
She has a daughter in the
senior class, Allison MacKenzie.

422
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:41,660
-Beautiful woman.
-Yeah.

423
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:45,301
She's a widow. She was born here,
but she had ambitions and left...

424
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:47,732
married a New Yorker,
some advertising genius.

425
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:49,963
When he died, she came back here.

426
00:33:50,273 --> 00:33:53,401
-I'd like to meet her.
-Wouldn't do you no good.

427
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,871
Bring your coffee.

428
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:01,275
Connie, you haven't met Mr. Rossi,
the new school principal.

429
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:02,974
-Mrs. MacKenzie.
-How do you do?

430
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:06,417
Hello. I hear about you
every day from my daughter.

431
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:12,119
You've been working kind of late?

432
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:16,327
No, l've been to the movies.
Allison's giving a birthday party.

433
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,728
What does your daughter
plan to do after graduation?

434
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:21,927
She'd like to be a writer.
I'd like her to go to college.

435
00:34:22,138 --> 00:34:24,698
It's too bad she didn't have
some brothers and sisters.

436
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:28,969
-Why do you say that?
-I'm against only child families.

437
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:32,080
Only children are on the receiving
end of the attention and energy...

438
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:33,715
of the parents, good and bad.

439
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,680
l don't think Allison's
turned out badly.

440
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:38,820
She hasn't turned out yet.
Her life is just beginning.

441
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:42,788
Anyway, it's a late to give her
any brothers and sisters, isn't it?

442
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:45,427
ln your case, I'd say it wasn't.

443
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:48,598
If I didn't like you so much, Matt,
and know you so well...

444
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:51,460
Ah, now, Connie, don't
you go proposing to me.

445
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:54,034
-For you, Doc.
-Excuse me.

446
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:56,931
Try a cigarette.

447
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,732
-Swain speaking.
-Thank you.

448
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:01,467
l will be right over.

449
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:06,672
Speak of babies and they appear.
Mrs. Runkle's in labor. See you.

450
00:35:07,717 --> 00:35:10,311
-Thanks, Doc.
-Bye.

451
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:19,889
Doc Swain's always
talking about babies.

452
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:23,293
-They're his stock in trade.
-Not a bad subject though.

453
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,258
We teach school children
English, Math, History and yet...

454
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,997
we neglect the one subject that
gives them the most trouble in life.

455
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:33,835
You don't recommend classes
in baby-making, do you?

456
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:39,004
Only in theory. I intend to start a
Sex Education course in the school.

457
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:42,076
-Isn't that a function of the home?
-I think it would be.

458
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:44,344
And yet, not one
parent in ten does it.

459
00:35:44,554 --> 00:35:49,048
-No. Sex is taboo in the home.
-And it should be in the schools.

460
00:35:49,626 --> 00:35:52,254
Where would they learn?
ln the alleys, in parked cars?

461
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:55,056
They'll learn it when they marry.

462
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:57,699
Good night, Mr. Rossi.

463
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,673
Doc Swain offers
a special price for frostbites.

464
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:26,893
-Come on, Allison.
-Rodney!

465
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,915
Allison!

466
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:52,184
This was supposed
to be a birthday party.

467
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:54,515
-Mother.
-We were just playing Photography.

468
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:56,214
You turn out the lights
and see what develops.

469
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:59,088
Don't be fresh.
Just leave immediately.

470
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:01,657
-All of you!
-I'm sorry, Mrs. MacKenzie...

471
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:04,800
...but I caught her under the mistletoe.
-Will you please leave?

472
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:08,361
Happy birthday, Allison.
Come on, Betty.

473
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,314
Thanks, Allison.

474
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,131
Come out here.

475
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:46,137
Allison, I said "Come out here"!

476
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,581
l knew this would happen
if you invited Betty Anderson.

477
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:56,217
-It wasn't my fault.
-You and Rodney making love!

478
00:37:56,419 --> 00:37:58,444
We were kissing, one kiss.
Not making love.

479
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:01,852
Our house in darkness, and couples
necking all over the place!

480
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:05,017
l know, mother, but everyone
wanted to dance in the dark.

481
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:07,355
And I couldn't very well...

482
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,931
Well, mother, at every party in
this town, they turn out the lights.

483
00:38:11,134 --> 00:38:13,432
l don't want you to be
like everybody in this town.

484
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:15,536
l want you to rise
above Peyton Place.

485
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:18,832
It's my home and my town!
Why should I want to rise above it?

486
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:21,101
Because its standards are low.

487
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:24,576
These people spend time trying to
drag each other down to their level.

488
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,510
l don't want to be
perfect like you, mother.

489
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:28,813
l don't want to live in a test tube.

490
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:33,148
l just want to be me, and have
some fun, and have some friends.

491
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:35,881
I'd rather be liked
than be perfect.

492
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:38,754
By liked you mean being
poured over in the dark by...

493
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:41,123
by some young animal
with one thing in his mind!

494
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:43,697
Oh, mother, don't make
it sound like that!

495
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:45,898
Everything has to be
learned, even kissing.

496
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:49,697
And sex! ls that what you're going
to practice at your next party?

497
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:52,739
You keep trying to accuse me of
things I'm not even thinking about!

498
00:38:53,142 --> 00:38:55,235
Allison...

499
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:59,040
l don't want you to get a reputation
for a half-hour carelessness.

500
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:01,774
l already have one,
the wrong kind.

501
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:04,543
l want you to fall in love...

502
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:07,814
and, at the proper time,
to marry a man who respects you.

503
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:09,924
l want you to have a good name.

504
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:12,720
-I want...
-You want, you want, you want!

505
00:39:12,962 --> 00:39:14,759
ls that all you can say?

506
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:18,923
Well, if any man would ask me, I'd
run away and become his mistress!

507
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:22,771
Don't you ever let me hear
you say a thing like that again!

508
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:26,201
l don't know why I said it.

509
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:28,741
l don't know why I said it.

510
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:30,310
Allison!

511
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:35,969
Good morning, Ellen.
Hello, Rudy.

512
00:40:49,425 --> 00:40:51,859
-Hello, Allison.
-Hello, Joey.

513
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:53,551
Selena will be out
in a couple of minutes.

514
00:40:53,763 --> 00:40:55,424
-Thank you.
-Come out in the back.

515
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:59,032
-I got a new baby lamb.
-Oh, I'd love to see it.

516
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,340
Oh, it's darling.

517
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:09,041
l didn't show you my lizard.

518
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:13,142
l keep him in a box, right there.

519
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:18,276
l got some holes punched in it,
just so he can breathe.

520
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:20,545
His name is Pocahontas.

521
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:33,902
Used to be a man didn't
have to cook his own meals...

522
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:37,470
-Look at it all you want.
-Times have changed.

523
00:41:37,673 --> 00:41:39,538
Mom's working
and I'm late for church.

524
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:47,776
The way you parade up and down.
Taking off and putting on clothes.

525
00:41:47,984 --> 00:41:49,918
-I don't parade up and down.
-You do!

526
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,950
You just like showing
yourseIf off, don't you?

527
00:41:52,155 --> 00:41:54,817
l don't like to show myseIf off!

528
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:58,960
Just because we don't live in
a palace we have to act like pigs.

529
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:03,223
-We've got a trash can, remember?
-Well, well, well.

530
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:06,766
If you don't pick it up,
somebody else has to.

531
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:10,166
It wouldn't hurt you to take
the garbage out and bury it either!

532
00:42:10,373 --> 00:42:12,273
Or do you like living like a pig?

533
00:42:12,475 --> 00:42:15,205
What do you think you are?
A general? Always giving orders!

534
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:17,504
Take your hands off me!

535
00:42:24,987 --> 00:42:28,252
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her anymore!

536
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:35,225
Hey. It was just
a little family fracas.

537
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:38,400
l guess my little girl
is getting to big to spank.

538
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:46,808
It was my fault, Allison.
l made him mad.

539
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:49,307
Every family has fights.

540
00:42:49,512 --> 00:42:51,639
They're forgotten in an hour.

541
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:31,980
Hey, Norman, you know what?

542
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:37,090
There's a place I know
that I'd like to show you.

543
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:40,928
That no one knows about.
Not even you.

544
00:43:41,264 --> 00:43:43,596
It's my secret place.

545
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:47,001
l know every spot
within 3 miles of Peyton Place.

546
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:49,137
Not this one. Come on!

547
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,337
You were right.
l never knew this place was here.

548
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,338
l don't think anybody does, but me.

549
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:29,807
And maybe God.
And now you.

550
00:44:32,515 --> 00:44:34,915
It's beautiful!

551
00:44:37,253 --> 00:44:41,690
l've just decided. This is the last
time I'm ever going to come here.

552
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:46,590
Why?

553
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:49,890
Oh, I'm going to leave it
for somebody else to find.

554
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,528
Maybe your children
will discover it.

555
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:56,000
I'm never going to get married,
I'm just going to have lovers.

556
00:44:56,572 --> 00:45:00,099
-Oh, Allison...
-What's wrong with that?

557
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,942
No children to grow up unhappy.

558
00:45:03,145 --> 00:45:05,170
Nobody gets hurt, except maybe me.

559
00:45:05,381 --> 00:45:08,509
Yeah, but that's the worst kind
of emotional maladjustment.

560
00:45:08,718 --> 00:45:10,583
Who said so?

561
00:45:10,786 --> 00:45:13,516
-A book I read.
-What book?

562
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:16,289
Well, see,
l've sent out for a book...

563
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:19,288
It was US$ 1.98
in a plain wrapper.

564
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:21,622
-A plane wrapper?
-Yeah, a plain wrap...

565
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:25,665
And... Well, it was about
marriage and sex.

566
00:45:25,868 --> 00:45:28,268
l had it sent to me at the
post office, general delivery.

567
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:32,373
It took me about 2 weeks to get up
the courage to go pick it up.

568
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:38,839
Golly...
Golly, I know it sounds funny...

569
00:45:39,048 --> 00:45:41,448
but that was the only way
l could find out anything.

570
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:45,980
Norman, you know what?
l sent for a book just like that.

571
00:45:46,188 --> 00:45:49,123
ln the same plain wrapper.
General delivery.

572
00:45:49,325 --> 00:45:51,725
Really? The same one?

573
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:54,527
And I read every word of it.

574
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,632
And I think most of it is just
mid-Victorian nonsense!

575
00:45:59,268 --> 00:46:02,863
Maybe yours was better.
Hey, you want to trade books?

576
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:07,168
Oh, no.
I'd be too embarrassed.

577
00:46:08,744 --> 00:46:11,235
That's your whole trouble, Norman.

578
00:46:12,048 --> 00:46:14,278
Everything embarrasses you.

579
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:17,281
-Everything frightens you.
-I know.

580
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:21,348
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry we
started talking about all this.

581
00:46:21,724 --> 00:46:25,125
Hey, Norman, look...

582
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:32,794
it's about time you learn that girls
want to do the same things as boys.

583
00:46:33,736 --> 00:46:38,298
And you have the right to know how.
l think we should help each other.

584
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:43,811
-Are you suggesting that...
-Oh, Norman, don't get me wrong.

585
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:48,679
All I want is some normal,
intelligent discussion.

586
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:52,516
And maybe some normal affection
between a boy and a girl.

587
00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:54,189
Nothing more.

588
00:46:54,557 --> 00:46:58,926
Everybody in this town hides
behind plain wrappers.

589
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:02,529
You're so afraid.

590
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:06,631
You've even been afraid to
ask me to the graduation dance.

591
00:47:06,836 --> 00:47:09,828
Oh, Allison...
l want...

592
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:13,975
I'm just not asking anybody.
I'll be there, but I can't ask you.

593
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:17,612
-Why not?
-Well, my mother.

594
00:47:18,681 --> 00:47:21,149
Your mother...

595
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:24,719
Well, she wouldn't
actually forbid it.

596
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:30,222
It's just that she gets jealous of
anybody that I spend my time with.

597
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,996
Oh, you don't know her.
You don't have to live with her.

598
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:41,833
But she's my mother.
There's nothing I can do about that.

599
00:47:42,605 --> 00:47:45,005
You don't have
to tell me anymore, Norman.

600
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:47,539
Please, Allison,
l have to tell somebody.

601
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:50,576
She won't let me have friends.

602
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:52,513
She...

603
00:47:55,184 --> 00:47:58,210
She makes me tell her 1O times
a day how much I love her.

604
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:04,192
She's afraid she'll die alone
in a poorhouse. Oh, and marriage.

605
00:48:06,662 --> 00:48:11,065
Marriage, she says, is misery, and
a woman can only cause me trouble.

606
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:13,326
Oh, Norman...

607
00:48:13,536 --> 00:48:17,370
-I can't believe it.
-Nobody would.

608
00:48:17,573 --> 00:48:20,542
Now maybe you know
why I hate to go home...

609
00:48:20,743 --> 00:48:23,177
why I live in the library...

610
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:28,911
why I can't dance or kiss girls,
or look anybody in the eye.

611
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:32,919
You see, I'm a sissy and a coward.

612
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:35,314
No, you're not, Norman.

613
00:48:35,691 --> 00:48:40,060
No one around town stopped
to think and give you a chance.

614
00:48:40,763 --> 00:48:43,027
You shouldn't be afraid of girls.

615
00:48:43,232 --> 00:48:46,395
l know, but I am, and I don't
know what I can do about it.

616
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:49,293
-I know what you can do.
-What?

617
00:48:49,705 --> 00:48:52,071
You can start with me.

618
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:55,539
I'll prove everything
your mother ever said was wrong.

619
00:48:56,512 --> 00:48:59,208
Would you kiss me, Norman?

620
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:03,112
-I don't think I can.
-Yes, you could.

621
00:49:03,919 --> 00:49:06,217
Kiss me!

622
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,368
l don't know why
l should act so experienced.

623
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:27,770
It was only
my second kiss this year.

624
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:30,708
It wasn't as good
as Rodney's, was it?

625
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,304
No...

626
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:03,878
Hello.
l guess I should've phoned.

627
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,639
-But I was in the neighborhood...
-No, that's all right.

628
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:10,083
l have a message for Allison.
ls she home?

629
00:50:10,286 --> 00:50:14,086
No, she and Selena have just gone
over to Kathy Ellsworth's house.

630
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:17,054
It gives me a good
excuse to talk to you.

631
00:50:18,294 --> 00:50:21,821
-May I come in?
-Oh, of course.

632
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:27,830
-You have a lovely house.
-Thank you.

633
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,636
Please, come in.

634
00:50:37,546 --> 00:50:42,540
It's a very comfortable room.
Good books, pictures...

635
00:50:42,851 --> 00:50:44,876
My own hotel room is a bit basic.

636
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:46,884
l have a mirror for shaving,
a basin for washing...

637
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:49,922
and a closet where I hang
my coat, and that's about it.

638
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,821
-You ought to find a house.
-I'm trying to.

639
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:57,260
ln the meantime, I have my room,
which I clear out of after dinner.

640
00:50:57,733 --> 00:51:01,499
You said you had something
you wanted to tell me.

641
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:05,566
l was telling you something,
but you weren't listening.

642
00:51:08,277 --> 00:51:10,677
Your husband?

643
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:14,573
He died when Allison was 2.

644
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:22,123
And Allison?

645
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:26,260
-Well, a few years ago.
-She's grown a bit since then.

646
00:51:26,528 --> 00:51:30,726
l came to tell you that Allison
has been named valedictorian.

647
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:35,160
Oh, that's wonderful.
She'll be terribly pleased, and so am l.

648
00:51:35,504 --> 00:51:38,564
She's a fine girl.
Bright and sensitive.

649
00:51:38,774 --> 00:51:42,107
-You should be very proud of her.
-Yes, I am.

650
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:47,547
Well, that's what I came about.

651
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:53,083
-Good night, Mrs. MacKenzie.
-You are lonely here, aren't you?

652
00:51:54,123 --> 00:51:56,887
It's not the worst thing
that can happen to you.

653
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:58,389
Isn't it?

654
00:51:58,594 --> 00:52:02,530
You can learn to live by yourseIf.
You can get used to it.

655
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:05,928
Maybe, but that doesn't make it
the best way to live.

656
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:09,502
The best way?
What would that be?

657
00:52:09,705 --> 00:52:12,731
People meeting, talking...

658
00:52:14,243 --> 00:52:19,237
Well, in Peyton Place,
two people talking is a conspiracy.

659
00:52:19,448 --> 00:52:21,541
A meeting is an assignation...

660
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,150
and getting to know one
another is a scandal.

661
00:52:24,353 --> 00:52:27,481
l think you're hard on
the town and on yourseIf.

662
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,750
No, l... I'm quite
all right the way I am.

663
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:32,824
What were you going to do tonight?

664
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:36,486
Wash your hair, read a book,
go to the movies alone?

665
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:39,527
-Well, that makes time pass.
-Time shouldn't just pass...

666
00:52:39,735 --> 00:52:42,932
Mrs. MacKenzie, it should be used!

667
00:52:43,138 --> 00:52:46,073
-I wouldn't know where to begin.
-Begin at the beginning.

668
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:48,243
Begin by getting out.

669
00:52:48,444 --> 00:52:52,403
We need another chaperone for the
dance. Why don't you help us out?

670
00:52:53,482 --> 00:52:55,473
Will you come?

671
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:03,855
-I think I'd like that.
-Fine.

672
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:08,889
Good night, and thanks.

673
00:53:19,742 --> 00:53:22,302
-Good night.
-Good night.

674
00:53:35,324 --> 00:53:38,191
Betty Anderson's father
stopped me in the shop today.

675
00:53:38,393 --> 00:53:39,485
What did he want?

676
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:42,493
Ask me when you're going to marry
Betty, before or during college.

677
00:53:42,698 --> 00:53:44,325
l hadn't exactly thought
of marrying her.

678
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:47,400
l wouldn't hear of it
even if you wanted to!

679
00:53:47,669 --> 00:53:50,797
Anderson is a good foreman,
but his daughter's something else.

680
00:53:51,006 --> 00:53:53,566
-I agree.
-Then stop seeing her.

681
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:57,405
l can't stop seeing her right away.
l invited her to the dance.

682
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:58,841
Uninvited her.

683
00:53:59,047 --> 00:54:02,107
-Oh, dad, I can't do that!
-You're going to!

684
00:54:02,317 --> 00:54:05,514
Do you realize what would mean if
you were to marry the local tramp?

685
00:54:05,721 --> 00:54:09,020
When you marry, you're going
to marry someone your own level.

686
00:54:09,224 --> 00:54:12,022
-Call her and tell her it's off.
-Are you trying to kill me?

687
00:54:12,227 --> 00:54:13,319
Call her!

688
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:15,463
-Oh, please, dad...
-Go on, call her!

689
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:20,363
1O42W, please.

690
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:24,869
l can understand you wanting
to see this girl, but not in public.

691
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:28,167
-You know what I mean.
-Okay, nobody is fighting you.

692
00:54:28,377 --> 00:54:29,639
I'll be as big a
Harrington as you are.

693
00:54:29,845 --> 00:54:32,905
I'll marry a cold fish from Boston,
have one child, and cheat for life.

694
00:54:33,115 --> 00:54:35,015
An apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

695
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:37,617
Yeah, but, dad,
the graduation dance is important.

696
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,254
You want a new car, don't you?

697
00:54:40,923 --> 00:54:44,950
Betty? Hello, Betty.
This is Rodney.

698
00:54:45,894 --> 00:54:50,354
Look, Betty, this is so terrible
l don't know where to begin.

699
00:54:50,566 --> 00:54:54,468
-Tell her!
-The graduation dance is off.

700
00:54:58,207 --> 00:55:00,937
She hung up.
What a fine graduation!

701
00:55:01,143 --> 00:55:03,202
-I know someone you can take.
-Who?

702
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:04,970
Allison MacKenzie.

703
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,671
Her mother kicked me out
for kissing her on her birthday.

704
00:55:07,883 --> 00:55:11,114
I'll talk to her mother.
Allison is a girl of quality.

705
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,620
Quality is a good thing on woolen
cloth, but very dull on a big date.

706
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:35,542
l didn't know you were
such a good dancer, Allison.

707
00:55:35,978 --> 00:55:38,538
-Thank you.
-Yeah, sure.

708
00:55:40,115 --> 00:55:42,083
-Hi, Rod.
-Hi there, Allison.

709
00:55:42,284 --> 00:55:44,047
Hi.

710
00:55:51,426 --> 00:55:53,826
Hey, Rodney, looking for someone?

711
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:59,090
After the dance,
shall we go to Rockland? Okay.

712
00:55:59,468 --> 00:56:02,062
Oh, really?

713
00:56:16,184 --> 00:56:19,017
-Some more, Mrs. Mackenzie?
-No, thanks, Miss Thornton.

714
00:56:26,561 --> 00:56:29,121
May I have this dance,
Mrs. MacKenzie?

715
00:56:29,598 --> 00:56:33,227
l haven't danced for such a long
time I'm afraid I'd be terrible.

716
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:36,495
Dancing isn't something you forget.

717
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:56,082
Listen, Allison,
l promised a dance to Betty...

718
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:58,122
the second one after intermission.
Do you mind?

719
00:56:58,327 --> 00:57:02,593
-Not if you promised it to her.
-I'll see you around, okay?

720
00:57:10,403 --> 00:57:14,169
Allison. Did you see your mother
dancing with Mr. Rossi?

721
00:57:14,374 --> 00:57:16,365
No. l've never seen
my mother dance.

722
00:57:16,576 --> 00:57:18,976
Standing right over there.

723
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,844
They make a good-looking couple.

724
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:25,443
They do?

725
00:57:32,892 --> 00:57:34,860
-Hi, Norman.
-Hi.

726
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,538
Dance with me, Norman.

727
00:57:55,782 --> 00:57:59,218
-I don't know how.
-Just try.

728
00:58:08,161 --> 00:58:09,958
-Where are we going?
-You'll see.

729
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:12,222
Hey, Rodney, you got a new car!

730
00:58:12,432 --> 00:58:14,593
Come on, get in.

731
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:18,268
Rodney, it's beautiful!

732
00:58:25,611 --> 00:58:29,445
Here we are snug as peas in a pod.

733
00:58:29,649 --> 00:58:31,981
-Where are we going?
-Nowhere.

734
00:58:32,185 --> 00:58:35,484
I'm mad at you.

735
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:39,618
Come on, Betty.

736
00:58:39,926 --> 00:58:42,156
You really want to kiss me,
don't you?

737
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:44,921
-Oh, I do.
-Tell me how much.

738
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:46,155
-Betty, l...
-Tell me.

739
00:58:46,365 --> 00:58:48,799
l want to kiss you
more than anyone in the world.

740
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:51,561
l want to kiss you a thousand times,
and never want to stop kissing you.

741
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:55,673
That's pretty good.
I'll give you one kiss.

742
00:59:02,782 --> 00:59:04,716
What would Allison say?

743
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:08,148
Why bring her name up
at a time like this?

744
00:59:09,055 --> 00:59:11,922
Only one kiss to a customer.

745
00:59:13,693 --> 00:59:16,491
Betty, I couldn't help it.
My father made me call you.

746
00:59:16,696 --> 00:59:20,632
-Would you rather be with me?
-Yes. Yes.

747
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,892
Tell me how much.

748
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:28,665
ln the whole wide world there's
nobody I'd rather be with than you.

749
00:59:29,509 --> 00:59:32,501
Give me another kiss.

750
00:59:35,982 --> 00:59:38,450
Oh, honey, honey...

751
00:59:39,152 --> 00:59:43,145
-You want to make love to me?
-Oh, yes, of course I want.

752
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,131
Now, go make love
to Allison MacKenzie!

753
00:59:56,335 --> 00:59:59,065
Go get the girl you brought
to the dance and try with her!

754
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:04,102
And the next time I go out it will
be with a man not a papa's boy!

755
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:16,250
Ladies and gentlemen...

756
01:00:16,455 --> 01:00:19,322
pupils and faculty of
Peyton Place High School and...

757
01:00:19,525 --> 01:00:21,720
especially the seniors...

758
01:00:22,361 --> 01:00:26,525
they tell me it is a tradition here
to end each graduation dance with...

759
01:00:26,732 --> 01:00:28,495
"Auld Lang Syne".

760
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:31,932
Since I'm new here and not yet
part of your traditions...

761
01:00:32,371 --> 01:00:35,898
l think the song should be led by a
woman who has been with you long.

762
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:39,341
Miss Elsie Thornton!

763
01:00:52,992 --> 01:00:55,256
Thank you, Mr. Rossi.

764
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:02,263
We're a small spot, in a small town
on a great big map.

765
01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:08,370
And maybe Peyton Place High School
isn't a name that shakes the world.

766
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:12,902
But it's a part
of each of you forever.

767
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:18,107
Make it great by honoring it...

768
01:01:18,517 --> 01:01:22,044
and come back to see us
whenever you can.

769
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:26,089
Now, let's form a big circle.

770
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:28,920
Everyone holding hands.

771
01:01:43,109 --> 01:01:48,547
<i>Should acquaintance</i>
<i>Be forgot</i>

772
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:54,687
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

773
01:01:54,921 --> 01:02:01,292
<i>Should acquaintance</i>
<i>Be forgot</i>

774
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:07,691
<i>And days of</i>
<i>Auld Lang Syne</i>

775
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:14,271
<i>For Auld Lang Syne</i>
<i>My dear</i>

776
01:02:14,573 --> 01:02:20,512
<i>For Auld Lang Syne</i>

777
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,285
<i>We'll take a cup</i>
<i>Of kindness yet</i>

778
01:02:27,486 --> 01:02:34,153
<i>For Auld Lang Syne</i>

779
01:02:55,715 --> 01:02:58,809
It's an odd feeling being
in the school when it's so quiet.

780
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:00,918
l always think of it
as being sleeping...

781
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,089
resting up from the pounding
it takes during the day.

782
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,815
-Do you work here at night?
-Oh, yes, quite often.

783
01:03:07,026 --> 01:03:10,325
You don't realize the work and
preparation it takes to be a teacher.

784
01:03:10,529 --> 01:03:12,190
It's like...

785
01:03:12,398 --> 01:03:14,457
Well, it's like all these kids
were my own.

786
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,999
l love them.
l want so much for them.

787
01:03:17,203 --> 01:03:19,728
It's more than a job to you,
isn't it?

788
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:23,172
l didn't want to sound
like the dedicated idealist.

789
01:03:23,376 --> 01:03:26,174
Well, there's nothing wrong in that.

790
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:30,179
Connie...

791
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:33,349
l did want to thank you
for coming tonight.

792
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:36,453
Well, you don't have to.
l enjoyed everything.

793
01:03:36,655 --> 01:03:39,351
lncluding the dancing?

794
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,751
lncluding.

795
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,299
You're wasting your time, Mike.

796
01:03:50,503 --> 01:03:54,269
l had my love.
A long time ago.

797
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:57,772
And, when my husband died,
l came back here...

798
01:03:57,977 --> 01:04:01,879
and l've had no time for anything
but Allison and the dress shop.

799
01:04:02,014 --> 01:04:05,142
-You've got time now.
-It's too late.

800
01:04:05,351 --> 01:04:08,320
-Look, Connie, if l...
-I said it's too late.

801
01:04:08,521 --> 01:04:11,081
l made my choice.

802
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,349
Long ago.

803
01:04:14,593 --> 01:04:16,891
Please, take me home.

804
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,095
Sure.

805
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:38,246
Selena, let's get married.

806
01:04:38,551 --> 01:04:42,544
-You mean now?
-Sure, I can get a full-time job.

807
01:04:43,189 --> 01:04:47,683
What about college and Law School
that you've always talked about?

808
01:04:47,893 --> 01:04:51,226
It's just a dream. I can't do it.
My old man doesn't make...

809
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,660
But whose father does?

810
01:04:53,866 --> 01:04:56,994
Not everyone in college
is a millionaire's son.

811
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,598
Don't get so steamed up.

812
01:04:59,805 --> 01:05:04,208
Ted Carter, you've always wanted
to be a lawyer. Now, go be it!

813
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:07,311
Don't crumple up
at the first obstacle.

814
01:05:08,314 --> 01:05:12,148
The first obstacle
is the biggest: the money.

815
01:05:12,585 --> 01:05:17,045
Well, then, get over that,
and the rest should be easy.

816
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,125
Selena, you know how long
it takes to become a lawyer?

817
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:25,559
What difference does it make?
It's what you want to do in life.

818
01:05:25,764 --> 01:05:28,494
One of the things I want
to do in life is marry you.

819
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:30,566
If I don't do it now,
maybe I never will.

820
01:05:32,705 --> 01:05:38,007
Ted, the only family
I'll ever have will be half yours.

821
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:43,043
I'll wait,
no matter how long it takes.

822
01:05:56,328 --> 01:06:00,025
-Good night.
-Good night, Selena.

823
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:05,798
Ted...

824
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:08,402
thank you.

825
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:26,816
Mom?

826
01:06:28,994 --> 01:06:30,325
Mom?

827
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:33,597
Joey?

828
01:06:43,175 --> 01:06:46,235
l thought you were
something out of a dream.

829
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:49,039
Where are mom and Joey?

830
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:53,746
Let's... Let's have a drink,
celebrate your growing up.

831
01:06:53,953 --> 01:06:57,013
-Where are mom and Joey?
-Working at a party at Harrington's.

832
01:06:57,223 --> 01:06:59,487
Come on, let's have a drink.

833
01:07:00,259 --> 01:07:04,787
Rather stay in the dark,
getting kissed by Ted Carter.

834
01:07:05,764 --> 01:07:08,028
I'm going to bed.

835
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,517
About time I started
teaching you something.

836
01:07:30,723 --> 01:07:33,624
Lucas, let me go!
Lucas!

837
01:07:34,994 --> 01:07:38,589
Never had nothing I wanted!
Never had a beautiful woman!

838
01:07:43,836 --> 01:07:45,167
Let me up!

839
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:55,173
Let me offer to the class of 1941
this fun farewell.

840
01:07:55,848 --> 01:07:58,476
The world outside waits for you.

841
01:07:58,684 --> 01:08:02,279
It is a world full of love
and rich in opportunity.

842
01:08:02,888 --> 01:08:04,321
That may be dangerous...

843
01:08:04,523 --> 01:08:08,050
but if you hold firm to your
purpose and your ideals...

844
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:12,196
you'll storm the ramparts
of success and capture them.

845
01:08:12,398 --> 01:08:17,529
Tomorrow, you grow up,
and your true happiness begins.

846
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:31,308
-Thank you.
-My best wishes to you.

847
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:33,610
Selena Cross.

848
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,348
Norman.

849
01:08:36,555 --> 01:08:40,389
<i>At first, the diploma seemed</i>
<i>like a reward forthe past.</i>

850
01:08:40,592 --> 01:08:44,756
<i>But once in your hand it became</i>
<i>an obligation to the future.</i>

851
01:08:45,597 --> 01:08:49,124
<i>lndependence was a distant word</i>
<i>that we suddenly owned...</i>

852
01:08:49,335 --> 01:08:51,496
<i>and we exploded with it.</i>

853
01:08:52,638 --> 01:08:55,539
<i>Some of us splashed away</i>
<i>the summer.</i>

854
01:08:56,975 --> 01:09:00,308
<i>Or swooped and stretched</i>
<i>with joyfulness...</i>

855
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:04,448
<i>and emptied ourchildish piggy</i>
<i>banks of their play money.</i>

856
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:11,389
<i>Yet,others of us eager</i>
<i>to feel aduIt...</i>

857
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:15,287
<i>or,out of necessity,</i>
<i>begin ourwork early.</i>

858
01:09:15,494 --> 01:09:17,985
-Put the bottle on one step.
-Here?

859
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:21,689
<i>And gradually,as the happy</i>
<i>confusion of summer faded...</i>

860
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:26,803
<i>one by one we knew the morning</i>
<i>of responsibility was at hand.</i>

861
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:36,212
-Hi, Mr. Rossi.
-Hello, Allison.

862
01:09:39,918 --> 01:09:42,478
Did you read those stories
l gave you?

863
01:09:42,688 --> 01:09:45,248
Yes, I read them.

864
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:47,658
Well?

865
01:09:48,127 --> 01:09:51,893
-When did you write them?
-All summer, ever since graduation.

866
01:09:52,097 --> 01:09:54,088
Has anybody else seen them?

867
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:56,563
Only Selena.

868
01:09:57,202 --> 01:09:59,432
She thinks I'm a genius.

869
01:10:00,038 --> 01:10:04,532
What do you think? Are they good
enough to send to a magazine?

870
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:07,712
Yes, if you want
to end up in prison.

871
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:10,882
Those stories were full
of enough liable, slander...

872
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:13,847
and double-entendre
to hang us all.

873
01:10:14,052 --> 01:10:18,455
Allison, is that how Peyton Place
really looks to you?

874
01:10:18,657 --> 01:10:22,286
They were only fiction.
l didn't use any real names.

875
01:10:22,494 --> 01:10:25,327
You didn't have to.
l recognized everybody in town.

876
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:29,624
But let's get down
to the important part.

877
01:10:29,835 --> 01:10:34,101
You have a talent.
Those stories were a good start.

878
01:10:34,306 --> 01:10:38,367
-Now, where do you go from here?
-It's what I hope to find out from you.

879
01:10:38,577 --> 01:10:40,204
Then I suggest college.

880
01:10:40,412 --> 01:10:43,176
-With your talent and ideas...
-Thank you.

881
01:10:43,382 --> 01:10:47,182
But I don't want to go to college.
l never have.

882
01:10:47,419 --> 01:10:48,408
Why not?

883
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,386
Because I don't want to study
about writing. I want to write.

884
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:56,125
Nobody has to tell me Shakespeare
was a wonderful writer...

885
01:10:56,328 --> 01:10:58,819
or that a million wonderful books
have already been written.

886
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:02,694
Allison, those books
tell you how and why.

887
01:11:05,037 --> 01:11:08,598
I'd rather find that out myseIf
at a typewriter.

888
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:13,441
l need some place to get me going,
some place to start.

889
01:11:16,281 --> 01:11:21,241
All right. If that's how you feel
about it, then let's do it.

890
01:11:22,721 --> 01:11:25,349
Let's start at the
"Peyton Place Times".

891
01:11:26,525 --> 01:11:29,494
Who said I was a cynical
hard-hearted newspaperman?

892
01:11:29,695 --> 01:11:31,754
Aren't all newspapermen
supposed to be?

893
01:11:31,964 --> 01:11:35,456
Allison that's a myth. We're the
most sentimental slobs in the world.

894
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:38,795
-The softest touches there are.
-Prove it.

895
01:11:40,038 --> 01:11:42,598
-All right.
-When do I start?

896
01:11:42,808 --> 01:11:45,174
All I want is a chance
to show what I can do.

897
01:11:45,377 --> 01:11:47,811
Write something up this week
and I'll run it on Friday.

898
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,475
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Bushwell.

899
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:53,150
I'll start right away.
I'll dig up a story you'll never forget.

900
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:55,217
-I don't doubt it.
-Thank you.

901
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,355
Just remember there's no
such thing as a cheap lawsuit.

902
01:11:58,957 --> 01:12:01,790
Hold on!
We haven't discussed pay.

903
01:12:01,994 --> 01:12:04,053
You don't have to pay me.
I'll do it for experience.

904
01:12:04,263 --> 01:12:08,063
The first thing that experience
teaches us is to get paid.

905
01:12:08,267 --> 01:12:11,600
Five dollars a column to start,
more later.

906
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:15,306
Gee.
That's more...

907
01:12:15,974 --> 01:12:19,535
Well, I wouldn't want these stories
to fall in the wrong hands.

908
01:12:23,515 --> 01:12:24,846
Thanks, Seth.

909
01:12:32,357 --> 01:12:36,191
There's no question about it.
The tests confirm you're pregnant...

910
01:12:36,528 --> 01:12:38,962
I'd say about 3 months.

911
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:42,323
-Who's the father?
-I won't tell you.

912
01:12:42,534 --> 01:12:47,836
What kind of rot is that? You're not
the 1st who ever had to get married.

913
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,271
Not in this town, for that matter.
Who's the father?

914
01:12:51,476 --> 01:12:52,966
-Ted Carter?
-No!

915
01:12:53,178 --> 01:12:56,739
-Don't you lie to me! Don't lie.
-I'm not lying to you.

916
01:12:57,249 --> 01:13:00,309
Doc, help me.
l need your help.

917
01:13:00,519 --> 01:13:02,680
What do you mean by help?

918
01:13:02,888 --> 01:13:06,016
l don't want to have the baby.
Give me something.

919
01:13:06,224 --> 01:13:08,351
There's nothing I can give you
to take that could help.

920
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,256
Just tell me who's responsible.
Maybe I can help you that way.

921
01:13:11,463 --> 01:13:14,193
-You can get married.
-He's already married.

922
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:18,332
Well, then he'll have to take care
of you and provide for the baby.

923
01:13:18,537 --> 01:13:21,563
-Just tell who it is.
-Please, just give me something.

924
01:13:23,575 --> 01:13:26,976
l've done a lot of things in my time
but l've never broken the law.

925
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:30,580
What you're asking me to do is
break the law of men and God.

926
01:13:31,049 --> 01:13:35,645
Now, tell me, who is the man?
Selena, tell me who he is. Who is he?

927
01:13:35,854 --> 01:13:41,053
It's my stepfather!
It's my stepfather! It's Lucas!

928
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:48,427
Hi, Doc.
Come on in, have a drink.

929
01:13:49,534 --> 01:13:53,561
-l've got Selena in my office.
-Selena? What for?

930
01:13:53,772 --> 01:13:56,240
She's pregnant.

931
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:01,009
l told her she'd get
in a mess of trouble.

932
01:14:01,213 --> 01:14:04,774
Always rassling around with that
Carter boy. She wouldn't listen.

933
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:07,247
You low, miserable crazy slime!

934
01:14:07,452 --> 01:14:10,683
-Don't you go shoving around...
-It's your child Selena's carrying.

935
01:14:10,889 --> 01:14:13,858
-It ain't!
-I can prove it, Lucas!

936
01:14:14,326 --> 01:14:18,729
l've got proof on you to put you
in jail for the rest of your life!

937
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:22,024
-I never touched her!
-Here, sign that.

938
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,427
It's a statement of the facts.

939
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:29,036
Are you out of your mind?
l never touched her!

940
01:14:29,241 --> 01:14:31,505
Maybe you'd like the State Police
to sweat it out of you.

941
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:35,043
l never touched her and I don't have
to sign nothing that says I did.

942
01:14:36,048 --> 01:14:39,677
All right. You don't want to sign
this paper, that's up to you.

943
01:14:40,052 --> 01:14:42,111
Doc, Doc...

944
01:14:43,321 --> 01:14:46,722
You know I could never do something
as awful as that, don't you?

945
01:14:46,925 --> 01:14:48,620
I'm going back to my office...

946
01:14:48,827 --> 01:14:52,763
and start telephoning
every father in Peyton Place.

947
01:14:54,299 --> 01:14:55,561
You wouldn't.

948
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:58,565
Don't know what they'll take it into
their heads to do but I know this:

949
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:02,069
you're the janitor in a school
full of young girls.

950
01:15:02,274 --> 01:15:04,242
And an hour from now,
l don't want to be in your shoes.

951
01:15:04,443 --> 01:15:07,435
Doc, doc, don't do it.

952
01:15:07,646 --> 01:15:11,082
l wouldn't think of fooling
around with any other girls.

953
01:15:11,283 --> 01:15:13,513
It was just Selena, Doc.

954
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:17,211
Well, there was something about her.
It was just Selena.

955
01:15:17,856 --> 01:15:19,619
Please, Doc, don't.

956
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:23,118
There's just one thing
that will stop me.

957
01:15:23,595 --> 01:15:25,825
You sign that.

958
01:15:36,174 --> 01:15:39,632
If I sign it, what are you
going to do with it?

959
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:42,541
I'll lock it up in my safe.

960
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:46,943
Give your pen.

961
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:55,255
Now get out of here
and leave a man to work.

962
01:15:55,460 --> 01:16:00,420
No, Lucas, you get out
of Peyton Place before dark.

963
01:16:00,632 --> 01:16:02,896
-Doc! I signed it for you.
-If you do...

964
01:16:03,635 --> 01:16:07,071
I'll keep this paper in my safe.
If you don't, I'll use it against you.

965
01:16:07,272 --> 01:16:10,207
-I signed it!
-Don't you ever come back here.

966
01:16:10,408 --> 01:16:13,571
Not next week,
not next year, not ever!

967
01:16:14,045 --> 01:16:16,741
If you do, I'll kill you myseIf.

968
01:16:50,282 --> 01:16:52,978
Well, you little...

969
01:16:53,305 --> 01:16:59,327
