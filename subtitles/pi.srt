{2402}{2485}9:13. Personal note.
{2517}{2583}When I was a little kid,
{2586}{2668}my mother told me|not to stare into the sun.
{2670}{2744}So once, when I was six, I did.
{2747}{2839}The doctors didn't know|if my eyes would ever heal.
{2873}{2926}I was terrified,
{2929}{2989}alone in that darkness.
{3018}{3066}Slowly,
{3069}{3147}daylight crept in|through the bandages
{3150}{3202}and I could see.
{3205}{3265}But something else|had changed inside me.
{3323}{3396}That day|I had my first headache.
{3472}{3546}Jenna, come back here.
{3574}{3628}Max, Max, can I do it?
{3630}{3799}- Jenna.|- What's 322 times 491?
{3802}{3860}158,102. Right?
{3863}{3911}Right!
{3914}{3974}OK, 73 divided by 22?
{3977}{4057}3.318...18...18...
{4060}{4147}..18...18...18...18...
{4542}{4622}12:45.|Restate my assumptions.
{4626}{4690}One: Mathematics|is the language of nature.
{4785}{4827}Two: Everything around us
{4830}{4884}can be represented and|understood through numbers.
{4981}{5066}Three: If you graph the numbers|of any system, patterns emerge.
{5113}{5211}Therefore, there are patterns|everywhere in nature.
{5278}{5310}Evidence:
{5321}{5365}The cycling|of disease epidemics;
{5403}{5458}the wax and wane|of caribou populations;
{5490}{5524}sun spot cycles;
{5557}{5635}the rise and fall of the Nile.
{5735}{5793}So, what about|the stock market?
{5796}{5873}The universe of numbers that|represents the global economy.
{5876}{5949}Millions of hands at work,|billions of minds.
{5952}{6047}A vast network, screaming|with life. An organism.
{6050}{6104}A natural organism.
{6107}{6162}My hypothesis:
{6165}{6248}Within the stock market,|there is a pattern as well...
{6251}{6286}Right in front of me,
{6289}{6373}hiding behind the numbers.|Always has been.
{6376}{6428}12:50, press return.
{6871}{6904}Hello.
{6907}{6942}Maximillian Cohen, please.
{6945}{7014}- Yeah?|- Hi, it's Marcy Dawson.
{7017}{7086}I'm a partner at the predictive|strategy firm...
{7089}{7132}- I told you...|- Sorry I haven't called.
{7135}{7214}I hoped we could have lunch|tomorrow. Say one o'clock?
{7815}{7870}- Max, good.|- Hey, Devi.
{7873}{7935}- I grabbed you some samosas.|- Great.
{7958}{8017}- Your hair!|- What are you doing?
{8020}{8090}- You can't go out like that.|- It's fine.
{8093}{8166}- Don't worry.|- It's fine.
{8204}{8261}- You need a mom.|- I gotta go.
{8280}{8403}Max. Here, your samosas.
{8406}{8454}Thanks.
{8498}{8581}16:23. Results.

{8806}{8846}a career high.
{8849}{8950}Am I bothering you?|I'm sorry, I'll put it out.
{8963}{8990}Name's Lenny Meyer.
{9034}{9060}And you are?
{9095}{9112}Max.
{9115}{9187}Is that Max? Max...?
{9190}{9281}- Max Cohen.|- Cohen! Jewish.
{9341}{9442}It's OK. I'm a Jew too.|Do you practise?
{9445}{9507}No. I'm not interested|in religion.
{9540}{9622}- Did you ever hear of Kabbalah?|- No.
{9624}{9685}- Jewish mysticism.|- Look, I'm busy right here.
{9689}{9747}I understand.
{9773}{9871}But right now is a very exciting|moment in our history.
{9874}{9973}Right now is|a critical moment in time.
{9976}{10043}- Really?|- Yeah. It's very exciting.
{10046}{10151}Have you ever put on Tefillin?|You know Tefillin?
{10154}{10234}Yeah, I know, it looks strange.|It's an amazing tradition.
{10237}{10325}It has a tremendous power. It's|a mitzvah Jewish men should do.
{10328}{10402}Mitzvahs, good deeds.|They purify us.
{10405}{10478}Bring us closer to God.|Wanna try it?
{10481}{10551}- Shit.|- You all right, Max?
{10994}{11067}Please. Please, a small one.
{11118}{11219}17:55. Personal note.|Second attack in under 24 hours.

{14158}{14232}- Hi.|- Mr Cohen?
{14235}{14299}Marcy Dawson here again,|from Lancet-Percy.
{14302}{14423}I checked my schedule and I'm|in Chinatown tomorrow at three.
{14426}{14506}I'd love to stop by to meet you.
{14509}{14574}It'll be worth it for us.|How's three sound?
{14576}{14673}- How did you get my address?|- I got it from Columbia.
{14676}{14722}Three it is.|Looking forward to it.
{14724}{14789}Wait a minute...
{15570}{15593}Max.
{16125}{16174}Stop thinking, Max.
{16177}{16249}Just feel. Use your intuition.
{16428}{16532}- What did you think of Hamlet?|- I didn't get to it.
{16535}{16663}It's been a month. You haven't|taken a single break.
{16745}{16803}I'm so close.
{16865}{16950}Have you met the new fish|my niece bought me?
{16953}{17068}I named her lcarus after you,|my renegade pupil.
{17071}{17148}You fly too high,|you'll get burnt.
{17168}{17237}I look at you,|I see myself 30 years ago.
{17240}{17389}My greatest pupil.|Published at 16, PhD at 20.
{17392}{17475}But life|isn't just mathematics, Max.
{17478}{17571}I spent 40 years searching|for patterns in Pi.
{17594}{17671}- I found nothing.|- You found things.
{17699}{17736}I found things...
{17777}{17827}but not a pattern.
{17920}{18003}Not a pattern.
{18006}{18086}11:22. Personal note.
{18089}{18172}Sol died a little when|he stopped research on Pi.
{18211}{18287}It wasn't just the stroke.
{18290}{18363}He stopped caring.
{18423}{18458}How could he stop,
{18461}{18568}when he was so close to seeing|Pi for what it really is?
{18700}{18782}How could you stop believing|that there is a pattern,
{18785}{18868}an ordered shape behind those|numbers, when you were so close?
{18983}{19042}We see the simplicity|of the circle,
{19045}{19112}we see the maddening complexity|of the endless numbers,
{19115}{19204}3.14 off into infinity.
{19207}{19271}# Are the stars out tonight?

{20345}{20405}Hey, Max.
{20408}{20445}Lenny Meyer.
{20470}{20495}I'll put it out.
{20562}{20638}So... What do you do?
{20715}{20800}I work with computers. Math.
{20803}{20851}Math? What kind of math?
{20855}{20912}Number theory. Research mostly.
{20915}{20974}No way.|I work with numbers myself.
{20977}{21078}I mean, not traditional.|I work with the Torah. Amazing!
{21148}{21227}Hebrew is all math.|It's all numbers.
{21255}{21295}You know that? Look.
{21298}{21373}Ancient Jews used Hebrew|as their numerical system.
{21376}{21431}Each letter's a number.
{21434}{21550}The Hebrew A, Aleph, is 1 .|B, Bet, is 2.
{21553}{21646}Understand? But look,|the numbers are interrelated.
{21648}{21708}Take the Hebrew for father, ab.
{21712}{21784}Aleph, Bet.
{21787}{21847}1, 2 equals 3.
{21850}{21902}The word for mother, haim.
{21905}{21973}Aleph, Mem.
{21976}{22125}1, 40 equals 41 .|The sum of 3 and 41, 44.
{22128}{22246}Right? Now, the Hebrew word for|child - mother, father, child.
{22249}{22302}Yelev.
{22305}{22378}That's 10, 30 and 4.
{22430}{22447}44.
{22503}{22576}Torah is just|a long string of numbers.
{22579}{22685}Some say that it's a code,|sent to us from God.
{22687}{22722}That's kind of interesting.
{22726}{22785}That's kid's stuff,|check this out.
{22788}{22849}The Garden of Eden, Kadem.
{22852}{22930}Numerical translation, 144.
{22956}{23035}The value of tree of knowledge,|in the garden. Right?
{23038}{23146}Aat ha haim. 2, 33. 1, 44. 2, 33.
{23149}{23218}- You can take those numbers...|- Those are Fibonacci numbers.
{23221}{23243}They're...?
{23246}{23316}You know,|like the Fibonacci sequence?
{23319}{23352}Fibonacci?
{23355}{23523}Fibonacci is an ltalian|mathematician in the 13th.
{23526}{23615}If you divide 144 into 233,
{23617}{23712}- the result approaches Theta.|- Theta?
{23715}{23866}Theta. The Greek symbol for the|golden ratio, the golden spiral.
{23899}{23947}Wow.
{23950}{24031}I never saw that before.
{24034}{24105}That's like that series|you find in nature?
{24108}{24221}- Like the face of a sunflower?|- Wherever there are spirals.
{24224}{24285}See, there's math everywhere.
{24819}{24874}Hey, I... Max?
{24885}{24971}13:26. Restate my assumptions.
{25149}{25247}can be represented|and understood through numbers.
{25372}{25437}patterns emerge.
{25440}{25528}Therefore, there are patterns|everywhere in nature.
{25531}{25584}So what about the stock market?
{25587}{25660}A universe of numbers that|represents the global economy.
{25662}{25727}Millions of human hands|at work, billions of minds.
{25730}{25806}A vast network screaming|with life. An organism.
{25809}{25867}A natural organism.
{25962}{26036}there is a pattern,|right in front of me,
{26039}{26096}playing with the numbers.|Always has been.
{26120}{26172}10:18, press return.
{26572}{26599}Max.
{26662}{26702}Max.
{27023}{27059}What the...?
{27189}{27231}Shit!
{27245}{27317}Aaargh! God damn it!
{27397}{27461}10:28. Results.
{27463}{27596}Bullshit. Euclid predicts AAR|at six and a half.
{27600}{27687}AAR hasn't been|beneath 40 in 20 years.
{27690}{27792}Explanations for anomaly:|Human error.

{31478}{31536}Euclid crashed.
{31539}{31631}- I lost all my data, hardware.|- Your mainframe?
{31633}{31658}Burnt.
{31679}{31710}What... What's happened?
{31714}{31791}First, I get|these crazy low picks,
{31794}{31869}then it spit out|this string of numbers.
{31872}{31954}I never saw anything like it.|And then it fries.
{31957}{32021}- It crashed.|- You have a print out?
{32023}{32084}- Of what?|- Of the picks, the number?
{32087}{32168}- I threw it out.|- What number did it spit out?
{32171}{32225}I don't know,|a string of digits.
{32228}{32290}- How many?|- I don't know.
{32293}{32423}What is it, 100, 1 ,000, 216?|How many?
{32426}{32477}Probably around 200. Why?
{32500}{32588}I dealt with some bugs|back in my Pi days.
{32592}{32661}I wondered|if it was like one I ran into.
{32664}{32717}Have you met Archimedes?
{32757}{32821}The one with black spots. See?
{32857}{32925}You remember|Archimedes of Syracuse? Eh?
{32962}{33074}The king asks Archimedes|to determine if a present
{33077}{33154}he has received|is actually solid gold.
{33157}{33206}Unsolved problem at the time.
{33209}{33291}It tortures the great Greek|mathematician for weeks.
{33294}{33390}Insomnia haunts him and he|twists and turns in his bed
{33393}{33522}for nights on end. Finally,|his equally exhausted wife,
{33525}{33594}forced to share a bed|with this genius,
{33597}{33719}convinces him|to take a bath, to relax.
{33722}{33869}While he's entering the tub,|he notices the bath water rise.
{33872}{34003}Displacement -|a way to determine volume,
{34006}{34086}and thus a way|to determine density.
{34089}{34239}Weight over volume. And thus|Archimedes solves the problem.
{34242}{34318}He screams "Eureka!"|and he is so overwhelmed,
{34321}{34403}he runs naked through the|streets to the king's palace
{34406}{34462}to report his discovery.
{34505}{34601}Now, what is the moral|of the story?
{34654}{34698}That a breakthrough will come.
{34701}{34814}Wrong! The point of the story|is the wife.
{34817}{34877}Listen to your wife,|she'll give you perspective.
{34880}{34928}Meaning, you need a break.
{34931}{35008}You must take a bath|or you'll get nowhere.
{35011}{35094}There will be no order,|only chaos.
{35144}{35252}Go home, Max,|and you take a bath.
{36102}{36185}Excuse me.|Can I take a look at the paper?
{36403}{36461}Oh, my God.
{36636}{36694}Six and a half.
{36696}{36728}Hey...
{36774}{36796}Hey!
{36799}{36830}The paper, please.
{37947}{38091}Mr Cohen? Perfect timing.|I was going to head home.
{38094}{38171}- Who are you?|- Marcy Dawson. We were meeting.
{38174}{38196}It's really not...
{38199}{38270}It's such a pleasure|to finally meet you.
{38273}{38313}- I studied your paper...|- Excuse me.
{38316}{38368}- Let's take my car.|- I can't.
{38371}{38392}Mr Cohen...
{39172}{39220}Yes!
{39613}{39722}I just threw out something.|I didn't realise I needed it.
{39725}{39817}Just a print-out.|I lost my data.
{40059}{40156}Whoa! I'm sorry. Max.|How're you doing? Lenny Meyer.
{40159}{40215}- Where you going?|- Up there.
{40218}{40289}You got five minutes?|Do you wanna try Tefillin?
{40292}{40377}- Not now.|- I've a car to go to the Shul.
{40380}{40445}- You got a car?|- That's my friend, Ephraim.
{40513}{40542}- Let's go.|- Great.
{40591}{40631}When you said you're Max Cohen,
{40632}{40697}I didn't realise|you were the Max Cohen.
{40700}{40804}Your work's revolutionary.|It's inspired the work we do.
{40807}{40878}- It has?|- Very much so.
{40881}{40990}The only difference is, we're|not looking at the stock market.
{40993}{41040}Go ahead.|Wrap that round your hand.
{41043}{41107}We're searching for a pattern|in the Torah.
{41110}{41166}- What kind?|- We're not sure.
{41169}{41230}All we know is|it's 216 digits long.
{41233}{41331}- OK, stand up, please, Max.|- 216?
{41334}{41427}That's right. You've gotta|be quiet now. Stand up.
{41430}{41502}- 216?|- Shh. This goes on your head.
{41505}{41618}Look at me, Max. Right here.
{41622}{41689}There you go.
{41743}{41828}All right. Now, we'll say|a prayer together.
{41831}{41935}Repeat after me: Shma Yisroel.
{41938}{42007}- Shma Yisroel.|- Right.
{42010}{42102}- Adenoi Eloihenu.|- Adenoi Eloihenu.
{42105}{42196}- Adenoi Echod.|- Adenoi Echod.
{42259}{42334}Now, what's up, Max?
{42337}{42435}What is this 216 number, Sol?
{42438}{42459}Excuse me?
{42462}{42537}You asked me if I'd seen|a 216-digit number.
{42588}{42665}Oh, yeah. You mean the bug.
{42667}{42738}I ran into it working on Pi.
{42742}{42853}- What do you mean ran into it?|- Max, what's this about?
{42856}{42924}There are these religious Jews|I've been talking to.
{42927}{42971}Religious Jews?
{42974}{43023}Yeah, Hasids,|the guys with beards.
{43026}{43048}I know them.
{43051}{43145}I know one in a coffee shop.|He's a number theorist.
{43148}{43201}The Torah is his data set.
{43204}{43288}He says they're after|a 216-digit number in the Torah.
{43291}{43375}Come on, it's just coincidence.
{43378}{43413}There's something else, though.
{43425}{43454}What?
{43457}{43507}You remember those weird|stock picks?
{43510}{43608}- Yesterday's stock picks? Yes.|- They were correct.
{43610}{43707}I got two picks on the nose.|Smack on the nose, Sol.
{43748}{43777}Something's going on.
{43804}{43890}It has to do with that number.|There's an answer in it.
{43893}{44011}Max... Come with me.
{44014}{44078}The ancient Japanese|considered the Go board
{44081}{44147}to be a microcosm|of the universe.
{44150}{44273}Although, when it's empty,|it appears simple and ordered,
{44276}{44375}the possibilities of gameplay|are endless.
{44378}{44491}No two Go games are alike,|just like snowflakes.
{44494}{44587}So, the Go board|actually represents
{44591}{44729}an extremely complex|and chaotic universe.
{44732}{44822}And that's the truth|of our world, Max.
{44825}{44898}It can't be|easily summed up with math.
{44901}{44975}There is no simple pattern.
{44978}{45058}But as the game progresses, the|possibilities become smaller.
{45061}{45136}The board takes on order.|Soon, every move's predictable.
{45139}{45162}So?
{45165}{45255}So maybe, even though|we're not aware of it,
{45258}{45399}there is a pattern, an order|underlying every Go game.
{45402}{45480}Maybe it's like the pattern|in the stock market?
{45483}{45552}The Torah? This 216 number?
{45554}{45619}- It's insanity.|- Maybe it's genius.
{45623}{45714}- I must get that number.|- Hold on! You're losing it.
{45717}{45795}You have to breathe.|Listen to yourself.
{45798}{45903}You're connecting my computer|bug with one you might've had
{45906}{45959}and some religious hogwash.
{45962}{46087}If you want the number 216,|you can find it everywhere.
{46090}{46166}216 steps from your street|corner to your front door,
{46169}{46287}216 seconds|you spend in the elevator
{46290}{46345}When your mind becomes obsessed
{46348}{46449}you filter everything else out|and find that thing everywhere.
{46452}{46537}320, 450, 22, whatever.
{46540}{46668}You've chosen 216 and you'll|find it everywhere in nature.
{46672}{46730}But, Max,
{46733}{46828}as soon as you discard|scientific rigour,
{46831}{46903}you are no longer|a mathematician,
{46906}{46958}you're a numerologist.
{47046}{47064}Mr Cohen?
{47067}{47090}Mr Cohen...
{47093}{47163}God damn it! I'm sick|of you following me.
{47166}{47257}I'm not interested in money.|I want to understand our world.
{47260}{47311}I don't deal with materialists|like you.
{47314}{47392}I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
{47395}{47452}I admit|we've been too aggressive.
{47455}{47550}But all I ask is that|you give me five minutes.
{47552}{47648}- As a token, accept this.|- I don't want your money.
{47652}{47769}The suitcase isn't filled|with 50s, or gold, or diamonds.
{47772}{47832}Just silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.
{47835}{47919}Ming Mecca? They're not even|de-classified yet.
{47922}{48027}You're right, they're not. But|Lancet-Percy has many friends.
{48062}{48088}Beautiful, isn't it?
{48091}{48149}Do you know how rare these are?
{48185}{48215}What do you...?
{48272}{48317}Mr Cohen?
{48320}{48378}- Are you OK?|- No.
{48381}{48464}Mr Coh... Sir, are you sick?
{49820}{49868}Hey!
{53607}{53675}C'mon, buddy. Get up.
{53677}{53749}It's Coney lsland, last stop.
{53752}{53832}Here. For your nose.
{59041}{59124}Jenna, come back! Jenna!
{59157}{59225}Jenna, come back here.
{59577}{59661}- Farrouhk?|- No, it's Max, from next door.
{59727}{59791}Max. Is everything all right?
{59793}{59869}- Do you have any iodine?|- Did you cut yourself?
{59872}{59925}No, it's to stain a slide.
{59928}{60001}Ah. Science.|The pursuit of knowledge.
{60069}{60133}One second.
{60135}{60233}You surprised me.|I thought you were Farrouhk.
{60275}{60323}Here we are.
{60326}{60432}What are you examining?|A potato?
{60464}{60530}No. Just something|for my computer. Thanks.
{61934}{61988}- Shalom.|- Lenny, it's Max Cohen.
{61991}{62049}Max. What're you doing now?
{62052}{62125}I was thinking about|our conversation last night.
{62128}{62196}- That's good.|- I wanna help.
{62326}{62387}4:42. New evidence.
{62444}{62503}Remember Pythagoras.
{62506}{62639}Mathematician, cult leader.|Athens, circa 500 BC.
{62641}{62757}Major belief: The universe|is made of numbers.
{62760}{62824}Major contribution:
{62826}{62899}The golden ratio.
{62941}{63039}Best represented geometrically|as the golden rectangle.
{63042}{63102}Visually, there exists|a graceful equilibrium
{63105}{63144}between its length and width.
{63171}{63288}When it's squared, it leaves a|smaller golden rectangle behind,
{63291}{63350}with the same unique ratio.
{63353}{63460}The squaring can continue,|smaller and smaller,
{63463}{63492}to infinity.
{64291}{64358}11:18. More evidence.
{64361}{64465}Remember da Vinci. Artist,|inventor, sculptor, naturalist.
{64468}{64530}ltaly, C15th.
{64533}{64598}Rediscovered the perfection|of the golden rectangle
{64602}{64698}and pencilled it|into his masterpieces.
{64701}{64797}Connecting a curve through the|concentric golden rectangles,
{64800}{64894}You generate the mythical|golden spiral.
{64897}{64974}Pythagoras loved this shape,|for he found it in nature -
{64977}{65063}a nautilus shell, rams' horns,|whirlpools, tornadoes,
{65066}{65169}our fingerprints, our DNA|and even our Milky Way.
{65189}{65238}9:22. Personal note.
{65241}{65298}When I was a little kid,
{65301}{65379}my mother told me|not to stare into the sun.
{65382}{65433}So once, I did.
{65436}{65490}At first, the brightness|was overwhelming,
{65493}{65562}but I kept looking,|forcing myself not to blink.
{65565}{65628}And then the brightness|began to dissolve.
{65630}{65748}My pupils shrank to pinholes|and everything came into focus.
{65751}{65818}And for a moment I understood.
{65821}{65918}My new hypothesis:|if we're built from spirals,
{65921}{65976}while living in a giant spiral,
{65979}{66087}then everything we do|is infused with the spiral.
{66242}{66296}10:15.
{66299}{66385}Personal note.
{66388}{66492}lt's fair to say|I'm stepping out on a limb.
{66495}{66564}But I'm on the edge|where it happens.
{66566}{66620}I'm happy you...
{66626}{66706}Look, what do you want|in exchange for the chip?
{66708}{66783}You tech' guys.|I think you know what we want.
{66786}{66893}- I may not find anything.|- We'll take the risk.
{66896}{66961}First, I want you|to call off the surveillance.
{66964}{67000}Done. Anything else?
{67003}{67128}Yeah, I'm a very private person.|Just knock on my door
{67131}{67211}and leave the suitcase outside.|I don't wanna talk to anybody.
{67214}{67306}- How do I know you're home?|- I'll knock back.
{67636}{67760}- The Torah.|- Coffee.
{67796}{67844}What is it?
{67847}{67915}In Hebrew,|characters and numbers.
{67918}{68016}No, the 216 number. What is it?
{68019}{68073}I don't know.
{68076}{68174}If you can find it,|maybe we can figure it out.
{68177}{68320}- Can you really find it?|- If it's there, I'll find it.
{69022}{69058}Max.
{69061}{69109}Jenna.
{69112}{69172}- Can we do it?|- Not now.
{69175}{69206}Please, Max?
{70877}{70945}Happy birthday, Euclid.
{71615}{71705}18:30. Press return.
{73745}{73807}18:33. Press return.
{75129}{75193}Hell!
{75195}{75268}You fuck! You fuck!
{75550}{75608}Fuck!
{75970}{76009}Fuck!
{76341}{76414}Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
{76417}{76477}Fuck you!
{79392}{79465}Yes, hello?
{79468}{79542}He's busy right now, I'm sorry.
{79648}{79708}You were screaming.
{79710}{79819}Who said you could|put locks on the door, Mr Cohen?
{79895}{79953}Are you OK?
{80057}{80132}You're out, you hear me?|Out of here!
{80135}{80200}- I've had it with you!|- Get out!
{80203}{80269}Let's go. 
{80272}{80354}God damn it, no! You're the one|out of here, mister.
{80357}{80381}Get out!
{80384}{80441}Get out! Get out!
{80444}{80489}Get out!
{80553}{80588}Are you OK?
{80607}{80630}Get out!
{84343}{84391}You bastard.
{85413}{85459}Nineteen and a half.
{85490}{85526}Thirty-nine and an eighth.
{85570}{85611}Six and three quarters.
{85672}{85703}Seven and an eighth.
{85747}{85783}Twelve and a quarter.
{85872}{85945}I know these numbers.
{86117}{86232}They're going down...|down...down.
{86235}{86276}You lied to me.
{86331}{86361}You have it?
{86494}{86558}OK, sit down.
{86585}{86727}I gave up before I pinpointed|it, but my guess is that...
{86730}{86850}certain problems cause computers|to get stuck in a loop.
{86853}{86982}The loop leads to meltdown,|but just before they crash
{86985}{87118}they become aware|of their own structure.
{87121}{87239}The computer has a sense|of its own silicon nature
{87242}{87324}and it prints out|its ingredients.
{87351}{87421}The computer becomes conscious?
{87424}{87546}In... In... some ways...|I guess.
{87611}{87708}Studying the pattern|made Euclid conscious of itself.
{87712}{87820}It died spitting out the number.|Consciousness is the number?
{87823}{87897}No, Max. It's only a nasty bug.
{87900}{87983}- It's more than that.|- No. It's a dead end!
{87986}{88082}- There's nothing there!|- It's a door, Sol. A door.
{88085}{88163}A door to a cliff, you're|driving yourself over the edge.
{88166}{88240}- You need to stop.|- You were afraid.
{88243}{88305}- That's why you quit.|- I got burnt.
{88308}{88360}- Come on.|- It caused my stroke!
{88363}{88472}That's bullshit! It's|mathematics, numbers, ideas.
{88475}{88542}Mathematicians|should go to the edge.
{88545}{88610}- You taught me that.|- It's death!
{88614}{88656}You can't tell me what it is.
{88660}{88732}You've retreated to your Go|and books and goldfish.
{88734}{88759}Max, go home.
{88762}{88808}- You're not satisfied.|- Go home. Get out...
{88811}{88840}I'm gonna see it!
{88843}{88909}- Get out!|- I'm gonna understand it.
{89317}{89342}Hey!
{89478}{89497}Hey!
{89652}{89675}Hey!
{91269}{91350}- Who are you working for?|- Me.
{91353}{91407}- Who sent you?|- I'm a student.
{91410}{91481}- Gimme that.|- I've an assignment for class.
{91522}{91549}Leave me alone.
{91882}{92031}- Marcy. What's the matter?|- Let's go for a ride, Max.
{92034}{92077}I can't. I have work.
{92125}{92209}We had a deal, Max.|Now, let's get in the car.
{92212}{92308}- Don't ever touch me!|- Max! Max!
{92311}{92343}- Help!|- Max.
{92382}{92456}- Leave me alone!|- Max, come here.
{92459}{92553}Max. Where're you going, Max?|Stop, Max!
{92556}{92622}- Max! God damn it!|- Help! Help!
{92661}{92683}Help!
{92709}{92752}- Get him!|- I got him.
{92755}{92787}Come here, Max.
{92848}{92875}Get outta here.
{93309}{93402}- Where'd he go?|- He's over there.
{93722}{93752}Max.
{93755}{93821}Leave me alone!
{93824}{93897}- I got him.|- Get off of me!
{93900}{93993}- Help me! Help!|- Get over here!
{94054}{94151}- Sit down and shut the hell up.|- Calm down.
{94154}{94249}Didn't your mother ever tell you|not to play with matches?
{94252}{94293}The market's going to crash.
{94296}{94386}I didn't do anything.|I don't play the market.
{94406}{94463}Be careful where you throw out|your trash.
{94473}{94526}How could you do that?
{94530}{94643}You gave faulty information.|You dangled the carrot,
{94645}{94710}but only gave us|part of the code.
{94714}{94771}Now give us the rest|to set it right.
{94774}{94835}You bastards!|How could you be so stupid?
{94838}{94924}Max, you just don't get it.
{94927}{95053}I don't give a shit about you,|just what's in your head!
{95056}{95172}If you won't help us, we'll|comply with the laws of nature.
{95175}{95283}Survival of the fittest -|and we've got the fucking gun!
{95311}{95396}- Max! Come here!|- Lenny? Lenny!
{95399}{95495}- Hey!|- C'mon, get in here. Hurry!
{95498}{95545}Stay down! Stay down.
{95564}{95595}We've been looking for you.
{95598}{95668}- What's going on?|- You have the number?
{95670}{95721}What's going on? What is it?
{95757}{95801}What're you doing?|Get off of me!
{95804}{95838}Where's the number?
{95841}{95907}It's not on me. It's in my head.
{95910}{95987}You memorised it?|Did you give it to them?
{95990}{96042}- Who?|- Those Wall Street bastards.
{96045}{96101}- What do you care?|- Answer me.
{96152}{96219}Listen. This is really big.
{96222}{96300}I don't wanna hurt you.|Did you give it to them?
{96303}{96364}They've got part of it. Let go!
{96367}{96425}Damn it!
{96428}{96475}- They're using it.|- Using what?
{96478}{96553}Shut up! Impetuous little runt!
{96556}{96630}- Let go!|- No, don't!
{97638}{97686}Max.
{97704}{97752}Max.
{97771}{97819}Max.
{97842}{97866}Max.
{97919}{97955}You're all right.
{98004}{98097}I'm Rabbi Cohen.|Cohen, like you.
{98139}{98237}I'm sorry for what Lenny did.|He's been reprimanded.
{98240}{98335}It's not our way. Are you OK?
{98338}{98387}Yeah.
{98458}{98562}Max, you have|to give us the number.
{98609}{98669}What is it?
{98769}{98840}The Talmud tells us|it began 2,000 years ago,
{98843}{98895}when the Romans destroyed|the second temple.
{98898}{98959}What is this?
{98962}{99037}Max, you'll understand|if you listen.
{99040}{99123}The Romans also destroyed|our priesthood, the Cohanim.
{99126}{99229}And with their deaths, they|destroyed our greatest secret.
{99232}{99325}In the centre of the temple|was the heart of Jewish life,
{99328}{99399}the holy of holies.
{99402}{99506}It was the earthly residence|of our God.
{99509}{99593}The one God.
{99595}{99650}It housed the Ark|of the Tabernacle,
{99654}{99720}which stored the original 10|Commandments
{99723}{99810}which God gave to Moses.
{99813}{99917}Only one man was allowed|to enter this holy of holies
{99920}{100023}on one day, the holiest day|of the year, Yom Kippur.
{100026}{100068}On the Day of Atonement,
{100071}{100120}all of lsrael|would descend upon Jerusalem
{100123}{100219}to watch the High Priest,|the Cohen Godul,
{100222}{100291}make his trip|to the holy of holies.
{100294}{100394}If the High Priest was pure,|he would emerge moments later
{100397}{100471}and we'd have a prosperous year.
{100474}{100554}It meant we were one year closer|to the Messianic age.
{100557}{100710}But, if he was impure,|he would die instantly
{100714}{100809}and it meant we were doomed.
{100812}{100892}The High Priest|had one ritual to perform there.
{100895}{100963}He had to intone a single word.
{100966}{101023}Yeah?
{101026}{101124}That word was|the true name of God.
{101176}{101209}So?
{101212}{101305}The true name,|which only the Cohanim knew,
{101308}{101381}was 216 letters long.
{101507}{101575}Are you telling me that...
{101578}{101692}That the number in my head|is the true name of God.
{101694}{101775}Yes! It's the key|to the Messianic age.
{101778}{101846}It will take us closer|to the Garden of Eden.
{101849}{101917}As the temple burnt,|the Talmud tells us
{101920}{101980}the High Priest|walked into the flames.
{101983}{102051}He took the key to the top|of the building,
{102054}{102152}the heavens opened|and received the key
{102155}{102228}from the priest's|outstretched hand.
{102231}{102306}We have been looking|for that key ever since.
{102309}{102401}And you may have found it.
{102454}{102522}That's what happened.
{102605}{102654}I saw God.
{102656}{102787}No. You are not pure. You cannot|see God unless you are pure.
{102790}{102871}No... I saw everything.
{102874}{102999}You saw nothing, only a glimpse.|There's so much more.
{103002}{103124}We can unlock the door|and show God we're pure again.
{103127}{103224}You're not pure.|How are you pure? I found it!
{103227}{103395}Who do you think you are?|You are only a vessel from God.
{103398}{103463}You're carrying a delivery|meant for us!
{103468}{103527}It was given to me.
{103530}{103620}It's inside of me.|It's changing me.
{103622}{103740}It's killing you! Because you|are not ready to receive it.
{103843}{103916}It's just a number.
{103938}{104031}I'm sure you've written down|every 216-digit number.
{104034}{104108}You've translated all of them.
{104111}{104222}You've intoned them all.|Haven't you?
{104225}{104293}What's it gotten you?
{104296}{104364}The number is nothing.
{104438}{104508}It's the meaning.
{104511}{104634}The syntax.|It's what's between the numbers.
{104685}{104769}You haven't understood it.
{104772}{104865}It's because it's not for you.
{104884}{104964}I've got it. I've got it!
{104967}{105138}I understand it. And I'm gonna|see it. Rabbi, I was chosen.
{105141}{105225}17:13. Personal note.|Getting faster...
{105228}{105341}You stare into space like that,|you could go blind.
{105344}{105419}What can the eyes|do without the brain?
{105559}{105618}14:50.
{105696}{105754}15:10.
{105786}{105844}16:55.
{105853}{105911}10:35.
{105914}{105996}Already, I'm beginning to see.
{106107}{106160}Can I help you?
{106163}{106211}Sol?
{106214}{106272}Were you a friend?
{106275}{106390}- What do you mean?|- He had a second stroke.
{108368}{108441}No! No!
{108465}{108513}No!
{108804}{108902}Three! Five! Nine!
{108905}{108994}Ten! Eight! Six! Five! Two!
{109866}{109914}Five.
{109968}{110016}Eight.
{110053}{110101}Nine.
{110186}{110234}Seven.
{110237}{110351}No, Max. No.
{110361}{110409}Six.
{110412}{110485}Stay with me, Max.
{110559}{110628}Max.
{110807}{110848}No!
