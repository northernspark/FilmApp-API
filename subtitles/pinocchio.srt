Well, I didn't either.

23

Of course, I'm just a cricket
singing my way from hearth to hearth,

24
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:22,630
but... let me tell you
what made me change my mind.

25
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,185
One night a long time... ahem.

26
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:39,656
Pardon me.
Wait'll I fix this thing.

27
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:40,885
There.

28
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,588
One night a long time ago...

29
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,689
my travels took me
to a quaint little village.

30
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,757
It was a beautiful night.

31
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:51,996
The stars were shining
like diamonds...

32
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,199
high above the roofs
of that sleepy old town.

33
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,970
Pretty as a picture.

34
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:04,209
As I wandered
along the crooked streets,

35
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:06,547
there wasn't a soul to be seen.

36
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:09,246
The only sign of life
was a lighted window...

37
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:12,916
in the shop of a wood-carver
named... Geppetto.

38
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,926
So I hopped over...

39
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,323
and looked in.

40
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:27,668
It was a shame to see a nice cheerful
fire like that going to waste.

41
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,573
So what do I do?

42
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:32,633
I go in!

43
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,749
I looked around.

44
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:43,120
Of course, being in
a strange place like that,

45
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:45,486
I didn't know what to expect.

46
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:48,526
A cricket can't be
too careful, you know.

47
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:55,825
Soon as I saw there was no one about,
I made myself at home.

48
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:18,445
As I stood there warming my...
myself, I took a look around.

49
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,226
Well, sir, you never saw
such a place.

you ever laid your eyes on,

51

52
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:31,658

each one a work of art.

53

And shelf after shelf of toys and...

54
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,665
And then something else
caught my eye.

55
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,733
A puppet!

56
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,179

Little puppet made of pine,

00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:15,379
wake.

170
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:18,081
The gift of life is thine.

171
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:28,632
Whew! What they
can't do these days.

172
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,770
I can move! I can talk!

173
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:40,910
I can walk!

174
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:45,980
- Yes, Pinocchio, I've given you life.
- Why?

175
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,884
Because tonight Geppetto
wished for a real boy.

176
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:51,319
Am I a real boy?

177
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,358
No, Pinocchio. To make
Geppetto's wish come true...

178
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:58,225
- will be entirely up to you.
- Up to me?

179
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:00,662
Prove yourself brave,

180
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:04,167
truthful and unselfish,

181
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,170
- and someday you will be a real boy.
- A real boy!

182
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:09,001
That won't be easy.

183
00:17:09,073 --> 00:17:11,507
You must learn to choose
between right and wrong.

184
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:14,875
Right... and wrong?
But how will I know?

185
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:18,006
- How'll he know!
- Your conscience will tell you.

186
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:23,019
- What are conscience?
- What are conscience! I'll tell ya!

187
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:27,046
A conscience is that still,
small voice people won't listen to.

188
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,185
That's just the trouble
with the world today.

189
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:33,059
- Are you my conscience?
- Who, me?

190
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:36,862
Would you like to be
Pinocchio's conscience?

191
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,595
Well...

192
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,967
uh, I, l...

Uh-huh.

194
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:46,768
Very well!
What is your name?

195
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:50,803
Oh, Cricket's the name.
Jiminy Cricket.

196
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:54,443
- Kneel, Mr. Cricket.
- Huh?

197
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:57,520
No tricks now.

198
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,556
I dub you Pinocchio's conscience.

199
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:03,082
Lord high keeper of the
knowledge of right and wrong,

200
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,686
counselor in moments
of temptation...

201
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:08,823
and guide along the
straight and narrow path.

202
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,425
Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket.

203
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:15,598
Well! Ho-ho-ho! My, my!

204
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:19,473
Mmm! Say, that's pretty swell.

205
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:21,512
Gee... thanks!

206
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:24,844
But... don't I get
a badge or somethin'?

207
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,315
We'll see.

208
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:30,310
- You mean, maybe I will?
- I shouldn't wonder.

209
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,309
- Make it a gold one?
- Maybe.

210
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,109
Now remember, Pinocchio,
be a good boy.

211
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:39,016
And always let your conscience
be your guide.

212
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,518
Good-bye, milady.

213

Not bad, says I.

00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:55,491
Oh, yeah! Ho-ho-ho!
Almost forgot about you.

217
00:18:55,569 --> 00:19:00,666
Well, Pinoke, maybe you and I had better
have a little heart-to-heart talk.

218
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:02,572
Why?

219
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,100
- Well, you want to be
a real boy, don't you?
- Uh-huh.

220
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,239
All right, sit down, son.

221
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,218
Now, you see,

222
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:16,881
- the world is full of temptations.
- Temptations?

223
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,948
Yep! Temptations.

224
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:21,824
They're the wrong things
that seem right at the time,

225
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:25,991
but... even though the right things
may seem wrong sometimes,

sometimes the wrong things,
[Chuckle]

227

May be right at the wrong time,
or... visa versa.

Ahem. Understand?

Uh-uh.

But I'm gonna do right!

Attaboy, Pinoke,
and I'm gonna help ya!

232
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,686
And anytime you need me,

No, no.

- Like this? [Blows Air]
- No, son.

Come on, now.
Let's sing it!

240
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:13,869
When you get in trouble
and you don't know right from wrong

241
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,972
Give a little whistle
[Whistle]

When you meet temptation
and the urge is very strong

Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle

Not just a little squeak
Pucker up and blow

- And if your whistle's weak, yell
- Jiminy Cricket?

Right!
Take the straight and narrow path

give a little whistle

Oh, everybody has to sleep.

328
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:34,451
Figaro goes to sleep,
and Cleo.

329
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:38,829
And besides, tomorrow
you've got to go to school.

330
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,834
Why?

331
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:44,838
Oh, to learn things...

332
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:47,602
and get smart.

333
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,734
[Pinocchio]
Why?

334
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:54,407
Ahh... because.

335
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:57,383
[Pinocchio]
Oh.

336
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,824
[Laughter]

337
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:53,406
Oh, look, Father. Look!

338
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:56,136
- Wait! Stand still now.
- What are those?

339
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,610
Huh? Oh, those!

340
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,342
They are your schoolmates,
girls and boys. Now get in.

341
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:02,310
They are your schoolmates,
girls and boys. Now get in.

342
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:04,312
- Real boys?
- Yes!

343
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,315
But hurry now.
Oh, wait, wait!

344
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:14,520
Here's an apple for the teacher.

345
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,616
Now turn around
and let me look you over.

346
00:28:17,693 --> 00:28:19,627
[Chuckling]

347
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:23,495
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Here.

348
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,897
Run along now.

349
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:32,029
Ho-ho-ho, wait, wait.

350
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:35,565
Come back here, Figaro.

351
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:38,978
School is not for you.

352
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:42,108
Good-bye, Father!

353
00:28:42,184 --> 00:28:44,152
Good-bye, son. Hurry back.

354
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,986
Tra-la-la-la
La-la-la

355
00:28:49,124 --> 00:28:51,422
[Laughing]

356
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:55,691
Ah, Gideon, listen.
The merry laughter...

357
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:59,461
of little innocent children
wending their way to school.

358
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:04,165
Thirsty little minds rushing
to the fountain of knowledge.

359
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:07,640
School, a noble institution.

360
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:10,974
What would this
stupid world be without...

361
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:16,740
Well, well, well!
Stromboli!

362
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:20,016
So that old rascal's
back in town, eh?

363
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:24,048
Remember, Giddy, the time
I tied strings on you...

364
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:27,960
and passed you off as a puppet?

365
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:33,468
We nearly put one over
on that old gypsy that time!

366
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:36,834
[Laughing]

367
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:40,238
A little wooden boy.
Now, who...

368
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,437
A wooden boy!

369
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,774
Look, Giddy, look.

370
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:50,114
It's amazing.

371
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:52,653
A live puppet without strings.

372
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:55,622
A thing like that ought to
be worth a fortune to someone.

373
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:58,489
Now let me see.

374
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,085
That's it! Stromboli!

375
00:30:01,163 --> 00:30:04,690
Why, that old faker
would give his... Listen.

376
00:30:04,766 --> 00:30:07,064
If we play our cards right,

377
00:30:07,136 --> 00:30:12,233
we'll be on easy street
or my name isn't Honest John.

378
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:14,707
Quick!
We'll head him off.

379
00:30:29,057 --> 00:30:32,083
Shh! Now's our...

380
00:30:33,428 --> 00:30:35,419
No, no, stupid.

381
00:30:35,497 --> 00:30:38,625
- Don't be crude.
- [Hiccups]

382
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,828
Let me handle this.
Here he comes.

383
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:46,341
Ah, yes, Giddy, as I was saying
to the duchess only yesterday...

384
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,941
Oh!
Oh, how clumsy of me!

385
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:51,002
My, my, my, my.

386
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:54,938
[Honest John]
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

387
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:58,509
- I do hope you're not injured.
- I'm all right.

388
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:01,852
Ah, splendid!

389
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:06,361
Well, well.
Quite a scholar, I see.

390
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:09,556
Look, Giddy, a man of letters.

391
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:13,130
- Here's your book.
- I'm going to school.

392
00:31:13,202 --> 00:31:15,534
School! Ah, yes.

393
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:19,062
Then you haven't heard
of the easy road to success.

394
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:21,234
- Uh-uh.
- No?

395
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,940
I'm speaking, my boy, of the theater!
Here's your apple.

396
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:29,006
Bright lights, music, applause!

397
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:31,985
- Fame!
- Fame?

398
00:31:32,054 --> 00:31:37,549
Yes! And with that personality,
that profile, that physique...

399
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:41,460
Why he's a natural born actor,
eh, Giddy?

400
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,657
- But I'm going...
- Straight to the top.

401
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:47,725
I can see your name in lights,
lights six feet high.

402
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:49,998
- What is your name?
- Pinocchio.

403
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:55,339
Pinocchio!
P-l-N-U-O... Uh...

404
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:58,713
We're wasting precious time.

405
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,248
Come. On to the theater!

406
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:04,752
Hi diddle dee dee

408
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:09,183
A watch of gold
with a diamond chain

409
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:12,921
Hi diddle de day

Whew! Fine conscience

418
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:45,416
Late the first day.

419
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:50,363
Oh, well, he can't get in much trouble
between here and school.

A waxed moustache and a beaver coat
A pony cart and a billy goat

00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:06,673
Why, it's... it's Pinoke!
Hey, where you going?

425
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:11,300
- Wait!
- You ride around in a coach and four

426
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:13,539
- You stop and buy out a candy store
- Halt!

427
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:15,581
- An actor's life for me

Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me

429
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:22,885

from the finest shop
- Hey!

430
00:33:22,956 --> 00:33:25,186
- [Whistle]
- What was that?

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,290
[Honest John]
Jiminy? Up where?

433
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:34,300
Shh.

434
00:33:34,368 --> 00:33:39,169
- You must be seeing things.
- Oh, no, that's my conscience.

435
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:42,675
Now, now, now. Just calm down.

436
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:46,679
Why, there's nothing up there
to be afraid of.

437
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:53,848
[Groaning]

438
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,151

Over here.

00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:07,766
Over here.

443
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:10,268
Oh, Jiminy,
I'm gonna be an actor!

444
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:12,464
All right, son.
Take it easy now.

445
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:16,100
- Remember what I said about temptation?
- Uh-huh.

446
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,407
- Well, that's him.
- Oh, no, Jiminy.

447
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:22,846
- That's Mr. Honest John!
- Honest John?

448
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:26,784
[Mumbling]

449
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:29,515
Get me outta here!

450
00:34:45,972 --> 00:34:48,463
Ohh!

451
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:54,580
All right then,
here's what we'll tell 'em.

452
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:58,015
You can't go to the theater.
Say "Thank you just the same."

453
00:34:58,084 --> 00:35:02,214
- You're sorry,
but you've got to go to school.
- Mm-hmm.

454
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:04,257
[Honest John]
Pinocchio?

455
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:08,158
Oh, Pinocchio! Woo-hoo.

456
00:35:08,228 --> 00:35:10,355
Here they come.
Now you tell 'em.

457
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,830
Woo-hoo!

458
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:15,367
Oh, little boy!
There you are!

459
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:20,099
Where were we?
Ah, yes... on to the theater!

460
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:22,539
[Pinocchio]
Good-bye, Jiminy, good-bye!

461
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:25,703
- Hi diddle dee dee
An actor's life for me
- Huh? Good-bye?

462
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:28,077
- Pinoke, you can't go!
- A high silk hat and a silver cane

463
00:35:28,148 --> 00:35:30,048
- There he goes.
- A watch of gold
with a diamond chain

464
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:33,574
What'll I do?
I'll run and tell his father.

465
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:37,680
No, that'd be snitching.
I'll go after him myself.

466
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:45,955
Ladies and gentlemen,

467
00:35:46,032 --> 00:35:49,001
to conclude the performance
of this great show,

468
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:54,371
Stromboli, the master showman...
that's-a me.

469
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:57,899
And by special permission
of the management...

470
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:01,004
that's-a me too.

471
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:04,346
Is presenting to you something...

472
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:07,250
you will absolutely
refuse to believe!

473
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,586
- [Crowd Murmuring]
- Well, looks like a sellout.

474
00:36:11,658 --> 00:36:14,024
Introducing
the only marionette-a...

475
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:16,255
who can a-sing and a-dance...

476
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:21,824
absolutely without
the aids of a-strings.

477
00:36:21,902 --> 00:36:24,427
I hope-a so.

478
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:29,237
The one... and only...
Pinocchio!

479
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:33,075
- [Applause]
- Hmph! What a buildup.

480
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:46,757
I got no strings
to hold me do...

481
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:50,594

00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:32,342
- Met somebody?
- Yeah, two big monsters!

646
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:35,644
With big green eyes.

647
00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:37,684
Why, l...

648
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,811
Monsters?
Weren't you afraid?

649
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:43,823
No, ma'am.
But they tied me in a big sack.

650
00:48:45,726 --> 00:48:48,194
You don't say!

651
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:52,198
- And where was Sir Jiminy?
- Huh? Oh, Jiminy?

652
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,200
Psst.
Leave me outta this.

653
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,964
They put him in a little sack.

654
00:48:57,037 --> 00:49:00,234
- No!
- Yeah!

655
00:49:00,307 --> 00:49:02,571
- How did you escape?
- I didn't.

656
00:49:02,643 --> 00:49:05,043
They chopped me into firewood!

657
00:49:08,315 --> 00:49:12,718
Oh, look, my nose!
What's happened?

658
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,084
Perhaps you haven't been
telling the truth, Pinocchio.

659
00:49:15,156 --> 00:49:19,286
- Perhaps?
- Oh, but I have! Every single word!

660
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:27,698
Oh, please help me.
I'm awful sorry.

661
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:31,363
You see, Pinocchio,
a lie keeps growing and growing...

662
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,872
until it's as plain
as the nose on your face.

663
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,466
She's right, Pinoke,
you better come clean.

664
00:49:36,544 --> 00:49:39,775
I'll never lie again,
honest, I won't.

665
00:49:39,847 --> 00:49:43,180
Please, your honor,
uh, I mean... Miss Fairy.

666
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,741
Give him another chance
for my sake.

667
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:48,549
Will ya? Huh?

668
00:49:48,622 --> 00:49:50,954
I'll forgive you this once.

669
00:49:51,025 --> 00:49:53,755
But remember,
a boy who won't be good...

670
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,227
might just as well
be made of wood.

We'll be good, won't we?

672

Very well, but this is
the last time I can help you.

673
00:50:08,209 --> 00:50:10,905
Gee, look, Jiminy! My nose!

674
00:50:10,978 --> 00:50:13,913
Hey, we're free.
Come on, Pinoke.

[Stromboli] I buy-a new suit

I got-a no strings on me

Toodle-ooo, Stromboli.

A watch of gold
with a diamond chain

Hi diddle dee day
An actor's life is gay

It's great to be a celebrity

Honest John will stoop.

Nothing like that.

You see...

705
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:00,879
I'm collecting stupid little boys.

Stupid little boys?

No, no. There is no risk!

Now... I've got a coach load
leaving at midnight.

We'll meet at the crossroads
and no double-crossing!

- No, sir.
- Scout around.

- Any good prospects you find,
bring 'em to me.
- Yes, chief.

- I'll pay you well.
I got plenty of gold.

- I will. I'm going to school.

That's the stuff, Pinoke.

726
00:53:17,956 --> 00:53:20,015
I'd rather be smart
than be an actor.

Now you're talkin'!
Come on, slowpoke. I'll race ya home.

- Well, how is the great actor?
- I don't want to be an actor.

731

- Stromboli was terrible!
- He was?

732
00:53:44,716 --> 00:53:46,445
Yeah, he locked me in a bird cage.

- Uh-huh, but I learned my lesson.

That's it!
You are a nervous wreck.

Ahem. We must
diagnose this case at once.

My, my. Just as I thought.

741
00:54:13,578 --> 00:54:15,773
A slight touch
of monetary complications...

with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions
of the flying trapezes.

00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:58,962
Pinocchio! There's something...
phony about all this.

801
00:57:59,036 --> 00:58:01,129
I gotta get him outta here!

802
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:03,696
[Barker] Hurry, hurry, hurry.
See the model home.

803
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:08,768
It's open for destruction and it's
all yours, boys! She's all yours.

804
00:58:13,551 --> 00:58:16,179
What'd I tell ya?
Ain't this a swell joint?

805
00:58:16,254 --> 00:58:19,417
Yeah! Being bad's
a lot of fun, ain't it?

806
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,721
Yeah, uh-huh. Get a load
of that stained-glass window.

807
00:58:28,065 --> 00:58:31,466
All right, now.
Hop to it, you blokes.

808
00:58:31,536 --> 00:58:34,232
- [Whip Cracking]
- Come on! Come on!

809
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:37,001
Shut the doors and lock 'em tight.

810
00:58:37,074 --> 00:58:40,202
Now get below
and get them crates ready.

811
00:58:40,278 --> 00:58:45,580
Give a bad boy enough rope and he'll
soon make a jackass of himself.

812
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,948
[Wicked Laugh]

813
00:58:52,857 --> 00:58:56,054
[Jiminy]
Pinocchio!

814
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,322
Pinocchio?

815
00:58:58,396 --> 00:59:00,387
[Whistle]

816
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:05,769
Where is everybody?

817
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:09,839
The place is like a graveyard.

818
00:59:09,907 --> 00:59:12,603
I don't like the looks of this.

819
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:15,339
Pinocchio!

820
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:20,041
Hey, where are you?

821
00:59:24,088 --> 00:59:27,353
[Whistling]

822
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,935
Where do you suppose
all the kids went to, Lampwick?

823
00:59:39,003 --> 00:59:41,062
They're around here somewheres.

824
00:59:41,138 --> 00:59:43,663
What do you care?

825
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:49,245
- You're havin' a good time, ain't ya?
- Uh-huh, I sure am.

826
00:59:49,313 --> 00:59:52,612
Oh, boy! This is
the life, huh, Pinoky?

827
00:59:52,683 --> 00:59:55,277
Yeah!

828
00:59:55,353 --> 00:59:58,447
It sure is!

829
00:59:58,522 --> 01:00:01,218
Ah, you smoke
like me grandmother!

830
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:05,092
Come on,
take a big drag like this.

831
01:00:07,598 --> 01:00:09,998
Okay, Lampy.

832
01:00:26,951 --> 01:00:29,977
Heh, some fun, huh, kid?

833
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:32,912
Okay, Slats, your shot.

834
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:50,626
[Lampwick] What's the matter, Slats?
Losing your grip?

835
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:54,966
[Jiminy]
Pinocchio!

836
01:00:55,034 --> 01:00:57,093
So this is where I find you!

837
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:59,229
How do you ever expect
to be a real boy?

838
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:02,638
Look at yourself...
smoking, playing pool!

839
01:01:02,709 --> 01:01:06,008
Owww! You're comin' right home
with me this minute!

840
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,640
Hey... who's the beetle?

841
01:01:09,716 --> 01:01:11,650
Let go! Put me down!

842
01:01:11,718 --> 01:01:13,345
[Muffled]
Let me out.

843
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,478
He's my conscience!
He tells me what's right and wrong.

844
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:19,889
What? You mean, you take orders
from a grasshopper?

845
01:01:19,959 --> 01:01:22,894
Grasshopper? Look here,
you impudent young pup!

846
01:01:22,962 --> 01:01:25,988
It wouldn't hurt you to take
orders from your grasshop...

847
01:01:26,065 --> 01:01:28,363
Your conscience,
if you have one.

848
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,665
Yeah-yeah, sure.
Screwball in the corner pocket.

849
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,604
Woo-hoo-hoo!

850
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:46,113
Why, why... ya young hoodlum!

851
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:49,518
I'll knock your block off!

852
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:56,621
- [Laughing]
- I'll take you apart
and put you back together!

853
01:01:56,696 --> 01:01:58,630
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy.
He's my best friend.

854
01:01:58,698 --> 01:02:02,759
Why, I'll...
Your best friend?

855
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:07,033
And what am I?
Just your conscience!

856
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:10,507
Okay, that settles it!

857
01:02:10,576 --> 01:02:15,070
- But, Jiminy?
- You buttered your bread,
now sleep in it!

858
01:02:16,182 --> 01:02:18,150
[Yells]

859
01:02:22,555 --> 01:02:24,887
Ha-ha-ha! Go on, laugh.

860
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:27,983
Make a jackass outta yourself.
I'm through!

861
01:02:28,061 --> 01:02:29,995
- This is the end.
- But, Jiminy?

862
01:02:30,063 --> 01:02:34,432
- Lampwick says a guy only lives once.
- Lampwick... hmph!

863
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,527
Come on, come on.
Let him go.

864
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:45,468
Lampwick... hmph!
Lampwick!

865
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:49,777
It burns me up.
After all I tried to do for him.

866
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,945
Who's his conscience, anyway?
Me or that hoodlum, Lampwick?

867
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,285
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat out of here.

868
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,848
Open up that door!
I wanna go home.

869
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:03,191
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

870
01:03:06,766 --> 01:03:09,633
[Coachman]
Come on, you blokes, keep 'em moving!

871
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:13,661
Lively there now.
We haven't got all night.

872
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,300
[Braying Continues]

873
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,708
Where'd all the donkeys come from?

874
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:22,304
Come on, come on.
Let's have another.

875
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:27,511
- And what's your name?
- Hee-haw!

876
01:03:27,587 --> 01:03:30,784
Okay, you'll do!
In you go!

877
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:33,849
[Coachman]
You boys'll bring a nice price.

878
01:03:33,926 --> 01:03:36,486
[Wicked laugh]
All right, next!

879
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,395
And what might your name be?

880
01:03:39,465 --> 01:03:42,059
- Alexander.
- Hmm.

881
01:03:42,135 --> 01:03:44,194
So you can talk!

882
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:48,832
Yes, sir.
I wanna go home to my mama!

883
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:52,776
Take him back!
He can still talk!

884
01:03:52,845 --> 01:03:56,303
Please, please!
I don't wanna be a donkey.

885
01:03:56,382 --> 01:03:59,715
- Let me outta here!
- Quiet!

886
01:03:59,786 --> 01:04:03,688
You boys have had your fun.
Now pay for it!

887
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:08,352
Boys? So that's what...
Pinocchio!

888
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:12,295
Huh! To hear
that beetle talk...

889
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:15,232
you'd think somethin'
was gonna happen to us.

890
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:22,571
Conscience! Aw, phooey!

891
01:04:29,182 --> 01:04:31,514
Where's he get that stuff?

892
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:36,647
How do you ever expect to be a real boy?
What's he think I look like?

893
01:04:36,722 --> 01:04:39,850
- A jackass?
- You sure do!

894
01:04:41,093 --> 01:04:43,687
Hee-haw, hee-haw!

895
01:04:43,763 --> 01:04:46,129
Hey, you laugh like a donkey.

896
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:51,399
Hee-haw!
Did that come outta me?

897
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:57,100
Oh!

898
01:04:57,176 --> 01:04:59,474
Huh?

899
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:02,938
What the... What's going on?

900
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:06,984
Aaah!
I've been double-crossed!

901
01:05:07,053 --> 01:05:10,454
Help! Help! Somebody, help!

902
01:05:10,523 --> 01:05:12,957
I've been framed! Help!

903
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:16,051
Please, you gotta help me.
Be a pal.

904
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:18,790
Call that beetle.
Call anybody.

905
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,734
Mama?

906
01:05:22,802 --> 01:05:26,135
Mama!

907
01:05:26,205 --> 01:05:30,733
Hee-haw, hee-haw,
hee-haw, hee-haw!

908
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:44,391
Oh! What's happened?

909
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:46,493
I hope I'm not too late.

910
01:05:47,461 --> 01:05:50,328
What'll I do?

911
01:05:52,766 --> 01:05:54,825
Pinocchio!

912
01:05:54,902 --> 01:05:56,836
Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!

913
01:05:56,904 --> 01:06:00,203
Pinoke, the kids, the boys,
they're all donkeys!

914
01:06:00,274 --> 01:06:02,504
Oh! You too.

915
01:06:02,576 --> 01:06:06,410
Come on, quick!
Before you get any worse.

916
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,449
This way, Pinoke.
It's the only way out.

917
01:06:17,825 --> 01:06:21,090
Hurry up...
before they see us.

918
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:25,490
You gotta jump!

919
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:48,145
Jiminy? Jiminy?

920
01:06:48,222 --> 01:06:50,452
You all right?

921
01:06:50,524 --> 01:06:52,958
Sure!
[Cough]

922
01:06:53,026 --> 01:06:55,824
I thought
we'd never make it.

923
01:06:55,896 --> 01:07:00,162
Certainly feels good
to be back on dry land.

924
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:05,166
Come on, let's get home.

925
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:09,505
- Father, I'm home!
- We're home, Mr. Geppetto.

926
01:07:09,576 --> 01:07:12,636
- It's me, Pinocchio! I'm home to stay.
- [Bell Ringing]

927
01:07:12,713 --> 01:07:16,240
Here he is, Mr. Geppetto.
Home at last.

928
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:19,444
Hey, maybe he's asleep.

929
01:07:20,854 --> 01:07:22,822
Father?

930
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:25,586
Father, it's me.

931
01:07:25,659 --> 01:07:28,150
Pinoke, come here.

932
01:07:28,228 --> 01:07:30,162
Look.

933
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:32,391
He ain't here.

934
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:35,162
He... He's gone.

935
01:07:35,235 --> 01:07:37,499
Yeah, and Figaro.

936
01:07:37,571 --> 01:07:40,472
And Cleo too.

937
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:47,504
Maybe something awful
happened to him.

938
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:50,846
Don't worry, son,
he probably hasn't gone far.

939
01:07:58,192 --> 01:08:02,094
Hey! It's a message.

940
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:04,562
- What's it say?
- It's about your father.

941
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:07,862
- Where is he?
- Why, uh, uh. It says here...

942
01:08:07,935 --> 01:08:11,769
he went looking for you
and was swallowed by a whale.

943
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,898
- Swallowed by a whale?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

944
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:18,911
A whale?
A whale named Monstro.

945
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:22,540
- But wait, he's alive.
- Alive? Where?

946
01:08:22,616 --> 01:08:25,813
Inside the whale
at the bottom of the sea.

947
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:27,820
- Bottom of the sea?
- Uh-huh.

948
01:08:27,888 --> 01:08:31,824
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm going to find him.

949
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:34,326
Pinoke, are you crazy?

950
01:08:34,394 --> 01:08:38,455
- Don't you realize he's in a whale?
- I've gotta go to him.

951
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:42,628
Hey, Pinoke, wait!
Listen here, son...

952
01:08:45,072 --> 01:08:48,200
This Monstro,
I've heard of him.

953
01:08:48,275 --> 01:08:52,769
He's a whale of a whale!
He swallows whole ships alive!

954
01:08:52,846 --> 01:08:56,680
Tie it good and tight now.
And besides, it's dangerous.

955
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,617
- Bye, Jiminy.
- Good-bye?

956
01:08:59,686 --> 01:09:02,348
I may be live bait down there,
but I'm with ya.

957
01:09:02,422 --> 01:09:05,323
Come on... let's go.

958
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:08,759
[Jiminy]
Look out below!

959
01:09:16,003 --> 01:09:19,234
[Gurgling Voice]
Gangway, down there.

960
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:30,642
Gee! What a big place.

961
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:43,722
Come on, Jiminy.

962
01:09:43,797 --> 01:09:47,756
All right.
Soon as I take on some ballast.

963
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:50,325
One side, sister.

964
01:09:54,808 --> 01:09:57,834
Well... so long.

965
01:10:01,648 --> 01:10:05,379
Hmm.
Put it in the wrong end.

966
01:10:10,023 --> 01:10:13,959
Hmm! No more privacy
than a goldfish.

967
01:10:14,027 --> 01:10:16,518
Ooo! Chilly.

968
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:23,459
Father?

969
01:10:33,008 --> 01:10:35,636
Father?

970
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:44,013
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!

971
01:10:44,086 --> 01:10:46,919
Father?

972
01:10:46,988 --> 01:10:48,922
Father!

973
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:51,185
Huh!
He ain't my father.

974
01:10:51,259 --> 01:10:55,059
Uh, Mr. Geppetto!

975
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,064
Hey! What the...

976
01:10:58,433 --> 01:11:03,393
Hey, let go! Run along,
you little... squirt.

977
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:05,406
What's the matter?
Can't a fellow... I was only...

978
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:10,875
We were only
looking for... Monstro.

979
01:11:10,946 --> 01:11:13,141
That got 'em.

980
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:17,810
Father?

981
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:27,827
Father?

982
01:11:29,965 --> 01:11:32,297
Oh! Hello.

983
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,661
Oh!

984
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:42,039
Can you tell me where we
can find Monstro, the whale?

985
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:45,477
Gee! They're scared.

986
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:52,115
Uh, pardon me, pearl,

987
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:56,783
are you acquainted
with Monstro, the whale?

988
01:12:02,831 --> 01:12:04,924
Whoa, hold it there.

989
01:12:11,406 --> 01:12:13,374
Hmph!

990
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:16,673
Father?

991
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:21,508
One side there, son.

992
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:24,518
Come on, boys, break it up.
Break it up now.

993
01:12:26,588 --> 01:12:28,419
[Whinnying]

994
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,981
[Jiminy]
Hey! What the...

995
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:33,892
Whoa, quit shovin'.
Don't crowd.

996
01:12:33,962 --> 01:12:36,192
Take it easy there.

997
01:12:43,905 --> 01:12:46,567
- Whoa there.
- [Whinnies]

998
01:12:46,641 --> 01:12:50,077
Steady there, Nellie.
Go ahead, Pinoke, ask them.

999
01:12:50,145 --> 01:12:53,774
Could any of you tell me
where to find Monstro?

1000
01:12:55,484 --> 01:12:57,918
Whoa! Whoa, boy.

1001
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:02,046
Uh, sakes alive.

1002
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:06,794
Father?

1003
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:12,597
- Father?
- Mr. Geppetto?

1004
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:55,238
Not a bite for days.

1005
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:04,149
[Geppetto]
We can't hold out much longer.

1006
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:09,819
Ah... Ah... Ah-choo!

1007
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:11,756
Ah-choo!

1008
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:15,625
I never thought...

1009
01:14:15,697 --> 01:14:19,565
it would end this way, Figaro.

1010
01:14:19,634 --> 01:14:22,228
Starving to death...

1011
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:26,741
in the belly of a whale.

1012
01:14:26,808 --> 01:14:30,403
My poor little Pinocchio.

1013
01:14:30,478 --> 01:14:34,539
He was such a good boy.

1014
01:14:35,617 --> 01:14:38,415
It's hopeless, Figaro.

1015
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:46,126
There isn't a fish left.

1016
01:14:46,194 --> 01:14:49,425
If the monster
doesn't wake up soon,

1017
01:14:49,497 --> 01:14:52,898
I'm afraid we...
we are done for.

1018
01:15:13,688 --> 01:15:16,282
Here they come!

1019
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:19,919
Tuna! Oh, tuna fish!

1020
01:15:22,697 --> 01:15:26,633
Food! We'll eat!
Here's a big one.

1021
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:32,639
Keep them in there, Figaro.

1022
01:15:34,509 --> 01:15:37,706
Wait! Wait a minute!
Have you seen...

1023
01:15:39,881 --> 01:15:43,286
Monstro!

1024
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,888
Ohh!
We gotta get outta here.

1025
01:15:53,096 --> 01:15:56,964
Woo-hoo-hoo! Come on, Pinoke.
Don't wait for me!

1026
01:15:58,535 --> 01:16:01,368
Never saw so many!

1027
01:16:04,374 --> 01:16:10,006
Whoops! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Here's another one.

1028
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,981
Enough for weeks!

1029
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:16,610
Here's a big one.

1030
01:16:23,193 --> 01:16:25,320
Keep them in there, Figaro!

1031
01:16:58,695 --> 01:17:02,461
Hey, blubber mouth, open up.
I gotta get in there.

1032
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:05,433
Looks like the last of them.

1033
01:17:09,706 --> 01:17:12,038
Here's a big one.
Only a few left.

1034
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:16,372
We gotta work fast.

1035
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:18,914
- Hey!
- Here's another one.

1036
01:17:18,982 --> 01:17:21,143
Hey, Father!

1037
01:17:21,217 --> 01:17:24,243
- Father!
- Don't bother me now, Pinocchio.

1038
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,880
P... Pinocchio?

1039
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:31,893
- Father!
- Pinocchio, my son!

1040
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:36,125
- Hey, Father, here I am.
- Huh? Oh, oh, yes!

1041
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:40,932
Pinocchio, my boy!
I'm so happy to see you.

1042
01:17:41,004 --> 01:17:43,131
Me too, Father.

1043
01:17:43,206 --> 01:17:47,142
- Whoops.
- Figaro! Ah, Figaro.

1044
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:50,145
Cleo! Oh, Cleo!

1045
01:17:50,213 --> 01:17:53,705
- You're here too.
- Yes!

1046
01:17:53,783 --> 01:17:56,809
- We're all together again.
- Ah-choo.

1047
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:59,650
- Oh, you are soaking wet.
- Yes, Father.

1048
01:17:59,722 --> 01:18:03,158
- You mustn't catch cold.
- But I came to save you.

1049
01:18:03,226 --> 01:18:05,592
You know, you shouldn't
have come down here.

1050
01:18:05,662 --> 01:18:09,462
- But, Father.
- But I'm awfully glad to see you.

1051
01:18:09,532 --> 01:18:12,501
Let me take your hat off.
Oh!

1052
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:14,969
Pinocchio!

1053
01:18:15,905 --> 01:18:18,237
Wha... What's the matter?

1054
01:18:18,308 --> 01:18:20,037
Those ears!

1055
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:23,204
Huh? Ears? Oh, these!

1056
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:28,080
[Chuckle] Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail too!

1057
01:18:28,151 --> 01:18:30,051
Hee-haw!

1058
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,486
Pinocchio!

1059
01:18:32,555 --> 01:18:36,150
What's happened to you?

1060
01:18:36,226 --> 01:18:37,784
Well, l...

1061
01:18:37,861 --> 01:18:42,161
- I, l...
- Oh, never mind now.

1062
01:18:42,232 --> 01:18:44,598
Old Geppetto has
his little woodenhead.

1063
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:47,192
Nothing else matters!

1064
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,205
[Jiminy] I gotta get in!
My pal's in there.

1065
01:18:50,273 --> 01:18:52,764
Come on, ya big moose!
Open up, I tell ya!

1066
01:18:52,842 --> 01:18:55,174
- Hey! Cut it out.
- [Squawking]

1067
01:18:57,881 --> 01:19:01,749
Hey, beat it, you buzzards!

1068
01:19:01,818 --> 01:19:04,787
Get out? Oh, no, no, son.

1069
01:19:04,854 --> 01:19:09,983
I have tried every way.
Why, I even built a raft.

1070
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:13,143
A raft? That's it!

1071
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:15,916
We'll take the raft
and when the whale opens his mouth...

1072
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:18,389
No, no, no, no.
Now, listen, son.

1073
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:22,292
He only opens his mouth
when he's eating.

1074
01:19:22,362 --> 01:19:26,492
Then everything comes in,
nothing goes out.

1075
01:19:26,566 --> 01:19:29,228
- Oh.
- It's hopeless, Pinocchio.

1076
01:19:29,302 --> 01:19:32,794
Come, we make a nice fire
and we cook some of the fish.

1077
01:19:32,873 --> 01:19:34,534
A fire! That's it!

1078
01:19:34,608 --> 01:19:37,873
- Yes! And then we'll all eat again.
- A great big fire!

1079
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:41,380
- Lots of smoke.
- Smoke? Oh, yes, sure.

1080
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:44,849
- Smoked fish will taste good.
- Quick, some wood.

1081
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:47,409
Pinocchio, not the chair.

1082
01:19:47,487 --> 01:19:51,116
- Hurry, Father, more wood!
- What'll we sit on?

1083
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:55,184
We won't need it.
We're getting out!

1084
01:19:55,262 --> 01:19:57,492
Getting out? But how?

1085
01:19:57,564 --> 01:20:02,934
- We'll make him sneeze!
- Make him sneeze? Oh!

1086
01:20:03,003 --> 01:20:06,461
That will make him mad!

1087
01:20:15,415 --> 01:20:17,883
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

1088
01:20:17,951 --> 01:20:20,579
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

1089
01:20:22,522 --> 01:20:24,683
Ah...

1090
01:20:24,758 --> 01:20:26,783
Ah... Ah...

1091
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:30,956
Well, it's about time!

1092
01:20:31,031 --> 01:20:33,226
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1093
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:37,396
- It won't work.
- Hurry, Father.

1094
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:39,405
Climb aboard.

1095
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:42,408
- We'll never get by those teeth!
- Yes, we will!

1096
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:46,412
Hey, which way you going?
Wait for me!

1097
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,449
Hang on. Here we go!

1098
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:50,949
Ah-choo!

1099
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:58,958
Gesundheit.

1100
01:20:59,025 --> 01:21:00,959
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1101
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:04,463
- We're going back!
- No, we'll make it. Faster, faster.

1102
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,795
Ah... Ah... Ah...

1103
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:09,529
[Geppetto]
It's no use. We're done for!

1104
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:11,093
Ah-choo!

1105
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,310
We made it!

1106
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:23,406
[Roaring]

1107
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:28,112
Look! Now he is mad!

1108
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,061
I told you he'd be furious!

1109
01:21:46,173 --> 01:21:48,403
- He's gone.
- Where'd he go?

1110
01:21:48,475 --> 01:21:51,171
Look out!

1111
01:21:51,244 --> 01:21:53,678
Hang on!

1112
01:22:01,988 --> 01:22:04,388
[Roars]

1113
01:22:07,761 --> 01:22:10,355
He's coming back.
Hurry!

1114
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:13,058
He's trying to kill us!
Paddle, son!

Jump!

1118
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:37,590
Father? Father?

1119
01:22:37,657 --> 01:22:40,251
Oh, Father!

1120
01:22:40,327 --> 01:22:43,228
Pinocchio, swim for shore.
Swim for shore.

1121
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:48,630
Hang on, Father.

1122
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:51,432
Save... yourself.

Don't mind me, son.

1126
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:13,079
Save yourself... Pinocchio.

1127
01:24:15,355 --> 01:24:17,414
Pinocchio?

01:24:18,892 --> 01:24:20,757
Oh, Pinocchio!

1129

My boy!

1133
01:24:41,514 --> 01:24:44,813
My brave little boy.

truthful and unselfish...

1135
01:24:59,165 --> 01:25:03,465
and someday
you will be a real boy.

1136
01:25:03,536 --> 01:25:06,198
Awake, Pinocchio.

01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:08,638
Awake.

1138

Father, whatcha cryin' for?

1139
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,712
Because...
you're dead, Pinocchio.

1140
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:22,721
No! No, I'm not!

1141
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:27,249
Yes, yes you are.
Now lie down.

1142
01:25:27,327 --> 01:25:30,626
But, Father, I'm alive.
See?

1143
01:25:30,697 --> 01:25:33,359
And I'm...

a real boy!

A real live boy. Ha-ha.

Professor, lots of music!

Oh, I think it's swell!

When your heart is in your dream

1161
01:27:05,492 --> 01:27:08,017
No request

1162
01:27:08,094 --> 01:27:13,293
Is too extreme

01:27:13,366 --> 01:27:16,301
[Chorus]
When you wish

1164

Upon a star

1165
01:27:21,417 --> 01:27:28,823
Your dreams come true

your dreams come true
