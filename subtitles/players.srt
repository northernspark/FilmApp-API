2
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,445
Welcome to Le Monte.

3
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:53,386
I am the owner of this showroom.

4
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,816
This is my manager Mr. Chopra.

5
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,418
Mrs. Thappar.

6
00:01:58,495 --> 00:01:59,553
Welcome.

7
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,597
Your husband called.

8
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:05,122
He also sent a blank check,
in advance.

9
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,395
Show off.

10
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:18,274
Yes.
- Hey, baby.

11
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,812
How is your shopping going?

12
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,744
Couldn't you find another showroom..

13
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:23,251
..to send your blank check.

14
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,377
Why? What happened?

15
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:25,751
There's nothing here.

16
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:28,450
Just relax. Give the phone to Chopra.

17
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,621
My husband.

18
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,219
Hello, sir.

19
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:34,388
Listen, tomorrow is
our first anniversary.

20
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:38,131
And I want to gift the most
expensive necklace to my wife.

21
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,192
Don't you think..

22
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,135
..you're paying a big
price for your first year.

23
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,502
Stop blabbering.

24
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:46,768
Now I feel I will get
divorced on my first anniversary.

25
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:48,105
No, no, no, sir.

26
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:49,270
How can you get such a big happiness..

27
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:51,176
..as long as we are there.

28
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:52,680
Just shut up.

29
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:54,444
What is he saying?

30
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:58,318
He is saying your
showroom is pathetic.

31
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:01,653
Go and get the 'Rose Of Samarkand'.

32
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:04,621
Congratulations, sir.

33
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:06,662
We are getting the
'Rose Of Samarkand'.

34
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,162
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,496
Yes.
- Are you happy now?

36
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:14,728
Presenting to you the
'Rose Of Samarkand'.

37
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:17,773
Exquisite finish by Iranian artist.

38
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,535
Just tell me this.

39
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:21,099
If I buy this how drastically..

40
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:23,578
..will it affect my
husband's bank balance?

41
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:26,479
Like four buckets of
water from the swimming pool.

42
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,208
That's all.

43
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:29,410
I mean four buckets of water..

44
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:33,251
..is all that he will be left with,
the rest will be gone.

45
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:34,756
Then I will take this.

46
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:40,595
Good morning.
- Morning, morning.

47
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:42,721
Hello, and hands up.

48
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,667
You, hands up.

49
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,536
Look, you can't get away with this.

50
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,474
This building is heavily guarded.

51
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:56,171
And my guards..

52
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,474
You press that.. I will press this.

53
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:07,381
You don't know who my husband is.

54
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:15,591
Go catch him.

55
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:24,597
Hurry up.

56
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,248
Surprising.

57
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:46,659
A thief spoiled my shopping
and you are looking angry.

58
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:50,794
Why did you sound the alarm?

59
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:55,360
I wanted to see you in action,
Charlie Mascarenhas.

60
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,500
'Are you happy now?'

61
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,438
'Pick me up once you
finish your shopping.

62
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,179
Good morning.

63
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:07,716
Hello, and hands up.

64
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:09,815
Hello, and hands up.

65
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:12,613
Hello.

66
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,179
Good morning.

67
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:25,063
You are my inspiration.

68
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:27,232
Keep your inspiration to yourself..

69
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:28,827
..and give me my share.

70
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,067
You already took that.

71
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,444
You don't know who my husband is

72
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,183
You are a real artist, Charlie.

73
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:44,484
Come on, let's go celebrate.

74
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,450
You know the rules.

75
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:50,583
Six months before and after the job..
- We won't see each other.

76
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,161
Its only six months.

77
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:24,252
Debrovsky.

78
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:37,756
Hi. Please leave your
message after the beep.

79
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:40,399
Hello, Shaila.

80
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,802
I sent you a parcel a month ago..

81
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,766
..and said that if
anything happens to me..

82
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,137
..then send that parcel to Charlie.

83
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,241
Seems like its time to
send that parcel to Charlie.

84
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:57,578
Where is the plan?

85
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:01,088
Where is it? Tell me.

86
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,587
Shaila, my heart felt condolences.

87
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,619
It's been less than four
days since your husband died..

88
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,488
..and you already stopped mourning.

89
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:23,638
Why? Don't you see my black dress?

90
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:28,802
Anyway? Why did you call me here?

91
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:36,044
Raj sent this from Moscow a
month before he died, for you.

92
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,185
He said that if
anything happens to him..

93
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,188
..then I should give it too you.

94
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:42,816
Your childhood
memory and all that crap.

95
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:44,389
Thank you.

96
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,722
Charlie.

97
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:49,060
Raj has left something for you.

98
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,226
It can be yours if you want.

99
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:56,537
You are hot, Shaila.
- I know.

100
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:59,473
But not so much that
I betray my friend.

101
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,440
And if I know Raj, he
has left much more for me.

102
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,508
See you.

103
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,349
The entire library
is waiting to be his.

104
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:12,250
And he's interested in that book.

105
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,382
If you're watching this DVD..

106
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:46,517
..then the breaking news is..

107
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,748
Come on, not again.

108
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:03,533
Hello, Naina. You hacked
into my computer again.

109
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,073
What can I do, Charlie?

110
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,109
That's the only way
to make you call me.

111
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,234
Naina, be serious.

112
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,244
I have to watch an important DVD.

113
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,309
I hope you are not watching porn.

114
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,675
I didn't know that a well educated..

115
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,708
..chartered accountant type
of person also watches porn.

116
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,811
I am not watching porn.

117
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:20,214
Whatever.

118
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,224
I just wanted to tell you
that I have finished my course.

119
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,658
For your information, now I
am a Masters in Computers..

120
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,195
..with a gold medal.

121
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,560
Well done.

122
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:34,733
Hey, wow.

123
00:11:34,804 --> 00:11:35,862
Hey. How are you doing?

124
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:38,333
Come jump in my car
we'll go for a drive.

125
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,204
Hang out, do some stuff.

126
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:45,805
Come on.

127
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,343
Naina.
- The second good news is..

128
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,319
..that I am coming
back to India tomorrow.

129
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,822
Really? Fantastic.

130
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,358
Good, now fix my computer.

131
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,327
Just type my name on
your computer sweetly..

132
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:01,658
..and it will be fixed.

133
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:02,823
But sweetly, okay.

134
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:04,794
Fine. Sweetly.

135
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,830
If you're watching this DVD..

136
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:44,737
..then the breaking news is that..

137
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,775
..the Russian Mafia has killed me.

138
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,771
Today I am going to
tell you a last story.

139
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,408
This story started in 1915.

140
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,784
During World War 1
when the German army..

141
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:59,252
..reached Romania's
capital Bucharest then..

142
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,415
..the Romanian government
decided to flee for their lives.

143
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,517
They took important
documents and their treasures along.

144
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:12,228
The Czar of Russia agreed
to keep their treasure..

145
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:15,361
..showing that they
are good neighbors.

146
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:17,095
Until the war ended.

147
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:19,634
So in this way, on 15 October 1916..

148
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:23,839
..tons of gold were
sent to Russia by train.

149
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,172
But by the end of the war..

150
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:28,182
..the Russian government changed.

151
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,651
The new government
refused to entertain Romania.

152
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,278
''Which gold are you talking about?''

153
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:36,384
And for the past 95 years that gold..

154
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,154
..has been locked up in the
Russian Czar's winter palace.

155
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,289
But the twist in the
story came in this year..

156
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,356
..when Russia finally accepted
that what happened was wrong.

157
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,799
And on this 15th October..

158
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,734
..that gold will be
shipped back to Romania.

159
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:50,704
Exactly the same way, by train.

160
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:52,468
Just like it was brought here.

161
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,099
Pure Romanian gold..

162
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:58,112
..which is worth 1
billion in today's date.

163
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,313
If Romania could survive for
95 years without the gold..

164
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,475
..then it can do so in future as well.

165
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,246
And it never
belonged to Russia anyway.

166
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,053
When something's unclaimed..

167
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:10,481
..then it either belongs to
God or to decent people like us.

168
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,125
Isn't it?

169
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:16,560
Before I leave I want
to give you a final tip.

170
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,300
Don't make the mistake that I did.

171
00:14:19,635 --> 00:14:21,796
This is not a job for one person.

172
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:23,500
You need a team, Charlie.

173
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,768
A team of the world's best players.

174
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,773
And there's just one man
who can get you that team.

175
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:33,843
Our guru, Victor.

176
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,481
Victor sir.

177
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:41,818
This is the safe of the house..

178
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,285
..where the robbery was committed.

179
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,758
Its been three weeks..

180
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:47,125
..but we couldn't
apprehend the thief yet.

181
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:49,391
If you want to catch a cunning thief..

182
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:51,223
..then try to understand him.

183
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:56,732
Not like a policeman but think
like a thief. - Note it down.

184
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,137
Thieves have three rules..

185
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,199
..that differentiate
them from policemen.

186
00:15:01,577 --> 00:15:03,511
Rule no.1.

187
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:06,070
Every thief is a kind of an artist.

188
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:09,779
And no thief betrays his art.

189
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,179
A policeman might forget
his duty but not a thief.

190
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,717
Rule no.2.

191
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:22,457
Only policemen retire. Not thieves.

192
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:26,198
Once a thief always a thief.

193
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,630
Rule no.3 and the most important rule.

194
00:15:32,107 --> 00:15:36,373
When a policeman is
tired of racking his brains..

195
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:40,313
..that's where a
thief starts using his.

196
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,415
Why do I feel that
he is slandering us?

197
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:48,488
Victor sir. What do you want to say?

198
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:53,790
I want to say that you
have lodged the wrong FIR.

199
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:58,323
This isn't a case of robbery
of jewelry worth 40 lakhs.

200
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:01,202
Come on, just help me here.

201
00:16:01,403 --> 00:16:05,271
Come, let's watch those
two pictures carefully.

202
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:09,574
One before the robbery
and the other after it.

203
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,104
Do you see the
difference in both the pictures?

204
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,748
I don't understand.

205
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:20,346
I mean the thief wanted Mr.
Malik's painting and he took it.

206
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:24,124
And he put up a fake
painting instead. - Fake painting?

207
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:29,161
Take a look.

208
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,658
Look, this is the real painting.

209
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:34,134
Look at the signature stroke here.

210
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,295
Its small, isn't it?

211
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:37,737
And this one is fake.

212
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:40,536
Look at the signature
stroke below this one.

213
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:42,236
It's longer.

214
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,576
It's longer, isn't it?

215
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,838
This is the work of a woman.

216
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,444
How can you say that?

217
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:51,418
My CA will tell you that.

218
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:58,454
Before the robbery this vase was here.

219
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:05,633
But after the robbery it
automatically shifted here.

220
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,536
These aesthetics can
never be of a man.

221
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:11,737
Do you understand now?

222
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:13,433
Yes, sir.

223
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:18,602
Do send me sweets when
you catch the thief.

224
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,443
Of course, sir.

225
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:22,773
How are you?
- Fine.

226
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:27,686
And my child Naina..
- She has now grown up.

227
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:31,453
Oh, yes. It's been 10 years. 10 years.

228
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:35,524
Doesn't she want to meet me?

229
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:38,392
She just returned yesterday.
She is suffering from jetlag.

230
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,731
Let it be. I know her.

231
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,361
She is like me.

232
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:44,570
She won't be convinced so easily.

233
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,071
Grandpa, there was another thing.

234
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:52,737
This is the 80 acre land
which you bought near Shimla.

235
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,510
This is our student dormitory.

236
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,244
These are the staff quarters.

237
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:58,513
And they will be so good that..

238
00:17:58,587 --> 00:18:02,216
..the best teachers of
India would want to teach here.

239
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:04,659
And all the facilities
will be available here..

240
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:08,025
..for orphan children to
help them compete in the world.

241
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:09,724
In short.

242
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,227
My incomplete dream.

243
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,659
Your dream can be fulfilled.

244
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:17,731
How?

245
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,064
I am your CA.

246
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,577
I must have thought of something.

247
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,612
You surely didn't
think of anything straight.

248
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,272
If you want to fulfill your dreams..

249
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:28,077
..in this country with a
population of 100 crore..

250
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:30,274
..then you can't think straight.

251
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,214
You taught me this.

252
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:36,248
You must have heard about Raj's death.

253
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,149
He shouldn't have
attempted this job alone.

254
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:47,429
This is the lead that
Raj has provided us.

255
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,097
And this has the plan
that I have thought about.

256
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:52,831
But I need your help.

257
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,606
And some players as well.

258
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,077
Which only you can provide me.

259
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:02,678
You know I have retired.

260
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:05,010
Rule no.2.

261
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,448
Only policemen retire.

262
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:14,194
You have fulfilled mine, Raj
and dreams of so many others.

263
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,427
I just want your only
dream to be fulfilled.

264
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,661
Grandpa.

265
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,469
Naina was asking me to
remind you about some promise.

266
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:32,441
Give this to Naina.

267
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:35,176
And tell her that her
papa has earned this..

268
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,184
..by weaving baskets in jail.

269
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:47,790
How is papa?

270
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,223
Is he fine?

271
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,263
Did you remind him about my promise?

272
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,560
Here, madam. Your father
has sent this for you.

273
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:57,464
His hard earned money.

274
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,446
You are crying.
- No, I am not.

275
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:09,814
Yes, you are crying.

276
00:20:12,454 --> 00:20:13,716
I love him, Charlie.

277
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,650
I miss him.
- Its okay.

278
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:21,192
Three weeks.

279
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,197
After that it will be
just my father and me.

280
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:26,100
Even his CA will have to fix
an appointment through me..

281
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:28,102
..to meet him, okay.

282
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,698
Done.

283
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,826
Three?

284
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,738
Has this become
legal in India as well?

285
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:07,437
Come on, Naina, I don't
even know these girls.

286
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,704
Now I get it.

287
00:21:08,777 --> 00:21:11,302
So this is your financial consultancy.

288
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:14,738
Hey, Charlie.

289
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:19,247
Happy birthday, Charlie.

290
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,220
''Hey, Charlie.''

291
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,628
''Why you got to be like that?''

292
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,258
''Tonight is your night,
let me delight you.''

293
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,363
''Charlie's Angels.''

294
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:39,873
''This restlessness.''

295
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:42,542
''The sweet pain.''

296
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:47,480
''The sleepless nights.''

297
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:52,444
''Charlie's Angels.''

298
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:55,215
''This restlessness.''

299
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,554
''The sweet pain.''

300
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:02,689
''The sleepless nights.''

301
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:05,198
''It's the effect of love.''

302
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,758
''It's a difficult journey.''

303
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:10,430
''I need your support.''

304
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:13,804
''Make my journey easier.''

305
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:19,474
''She crazy, Lord,
give her some sense.''

306
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:24,349
''She crazy, Lord,
give her some sense.''

307
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,081
''Her stars are weak.''

308
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:29,521
''Her intentions don't look good.''

309
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:32,185
''Her life's in danger.''

310
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,592
''Lord, give her some sense.''

311
00:22:34,663 --> 00:22:40,124
''She crazy, Lord,
give her some sense.''

312
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:15,567
''Everyone will know
of your love story.''

313
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:18,295
''Even if you don't speak.''

314
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,637
''Your eyes will reveal everything.''

315
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:25,705
''I admit that you don't
care about the world.''

316
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:30,676
''But what will your
parents say when they find out.''

317
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,652
''Daddy is waiting for me to say yes.''

318
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:36,384
''Even my mother is ready.''

319
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:42,727
''If you say yes then
he'll bless us both.''

320
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,714
Shall I tell you a secret, papa?

321
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:06,311
I won't go back home
until you don't come back.

322
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:14,392
How romantic.

323
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:18,694
So this is what you do..

324
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:21,133
..six months before
and after the jobs.

325
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:22,602
Rhea.

326
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:28,167
You are mistaken.

327
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:29,733
You know I am a one woman man.

328
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,270
That's fine.

329
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:36,812
But who's that one woman.

330
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:40,748
We are meeting after six months.

331
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,154
Have you got only questions for me?

332
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:47,293
I have a gift for you as well.

333
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:56,770
Happy birthday, Charlie.

334
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,167
Nice.
- Of course. It's a Malik.

335
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:02,569
Malik sir.

336
00:25:03,144 --> 00:25:05,669
Then it must be expensive.

337
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:09,277
Why spend so much?

338
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,146
Anything for you, baby.

339
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:17,121
Victor, you were absolutely right.

340
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:18,420
What?

341
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,222
Yes, I met Victor.

342
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:24,424
What did he say?

343
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:25,830
He didn't come?

344
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,829
I've given him the plan.

345
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,298
Now let's hope for the best.

346
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:34,637
''Lord, we are your devotees.''

347
00:25:35,143 --> 00:25:39,307
''Such should be our deeds.''

348
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:42,205
''May we follow the
path of righteousness.''

349
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:44,650
''And shun evil.''

350
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:48,519
''So that we can lay down
our lives with a smile.''

351
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:52,656
Call the ambulance.
- Quick.

352
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,563
Save me, Jesus.

353
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:01,302
Doctor, please save him.

354
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:03,564
There's a lot I have
to learn from him.

355
00:26:05,574 --> 00:26:07,269
Don't worry, Commissioner.

356
00:26:07,576 --> 00:26:09,237
It's my duty to save him.

357
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:14,107
So, Mr. Braganza. Are you
ready for the operation?

358
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,481
It's very risky.

359
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:19,816
But I am prepared to take this risk.

360
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:22,348
Thank you.

361
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:26,750
But this operation will be expensive.
- I know.

362
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:29,091
Call on this number.

363
00:26:29,164 --> 00:26:32,133
You will get the entire
amount for the operation.

364
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,465
A person is dying and he's
concerned about the costs.

365
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:38,529
Okay, Commissioner, we're
going to start the operation..

366
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:41,167
..can you please step out..
- Wish you all the best..

367
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:42,732
..for the operation.
- Don't worry..

368
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,712
..our operation will surely
be successful - Thank you.

369
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,338
Let's go.

370
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:52,246
''Still a lot to learn.''

371
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,415
But our players.

372
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:00,484
The players that you
need are present right here.

373
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:05,155
Explosives expert, Bilal Basheer.

374
00:27:07,702 --> 00:27:10,102
Since childhood he
has only two passions.

375
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,436
Imported cars and local explosives.

376
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,247
Bilal, you are great.

377
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,624
Bilal, you are great.

378
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,499
And since then Bilal Basheer became
Bilal 'Behra' (deaf) with his one ear.

379
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:42,627
Yet, he has contacts in every country.

380
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,831
He can speak 32 languages.

381
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:49,169
An expert in
explosives and spy devices.

382
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:51,745
Hello.
- Hello.

383
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,708
And he's Sunny Mehra.

384
00:27:57,585 --> 00:28:00,145
Master of prosthetics and makeup.

385
00:28:01,156 --> 00:28:03,090
He actually wanted
to be something else.

386
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:04,420
Actor.

387
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:06,483
'That Shah Rukh Khan style.'

388
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:08,560
'Have you seen your face?'

389
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,097
'Get out, get lost.'

390
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:11,723
'You don't become a hero..

391
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,563
'..by getting your picture
taken at Juhu Beach. - But..'

392
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:15,626
That day he decided he
will become an expert..

393
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:18,104
..in make up and prosthetics.

394
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,637
But you will have to stay
slightly careful of him.

395
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,234
He's a makeup artist after all.

396
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:24,471
He cannot keep a secret.

397
00:28:24,546 --> 00:28:26,173
Did you say anything?

398
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,546
No, no, I was just saying
that you are a fine artist.

399
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:32,643
You are embarrassing me.

400
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:34,086
You are born to be embarrassed.

401
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:35,520
Shut up, deaf.

402
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,682
What?

403
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:39,156
Nothing.
- No, you said something.

404
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,558
I see.

405
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:43,127
Seems like they get along well.
- Yes.

406
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:46,126
And he is Ronnie.

407
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:51,835
India's biggest illusionist.

408
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:53,535
Magician.

409
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:26,567
Due to some reasons Ronnie
stopped performing magic shows.

410
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:31,269
But thank God he said yes for
this operation when I asked.

411
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:33,676
Thanks, Ronnie.
- Yes, thank you.

412
00:29:34,215 --> 00:29:36,183
And you do know Rhea.

413
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:39,219
Part time automobile expert.

414
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,551
And full time artist like us.

415
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:44,091
There's hardly a man on earth..

416
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:46,257
..who can resist her charm.

417
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:08,078
And the next day I
read in the newspapers..

418
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:11,084
..that that night she didn't
just break south Africa's..

419
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:15,282
..seventh richest man's
heart but also his safe.

420
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:20,485
But I couldn't provide you
one man according to your plan.

421
00:30:21,162 --> 00:30:22,322
The hacker.

422
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:25,165
Not the hacker, world's best hacker.

423
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,391
Spider.

424
00:30:27,468 --> 00:30:30,494
No one knows who he
is or where he lives.

425
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,704
So is there an alternative for him?

426
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:35,506
Is there an alternative for you?

427
00:30:35,577 --> 00:30:37,442
Him, him, or her?

428
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,579
There is no alternative for the best.

429
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:41,171
You will have to find him.

430
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:45,443
And one last thing, Charlie.

431
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,715
I have broken a big promise.

432
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:53,486
I will make you pay for it.

433
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:55,796
To the last gram.

434
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:03,203
By the way, I have heard
that Spider is the best hacker.

435
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:06,173
He has hacked two of
NASA's satellites.

436
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:08,402
They had to travel to the Moon..

437
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:10,171
..but landed on Mars instead.

438
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,611
Which Spider are you talking about?

439
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,547
Just one of his friends.

440
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:19,746
I thought you are talking about
the world's best hacker Spider.

441
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,586
You know about Spider.

442
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,790
Yes, just briefly.

443
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,297
But this must be someone else.

444
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:34,233
What could a chartered
accountant want from a hacker?

445
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:35,664
I am interested, Naina.

446
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,662
He has stolen millions of
dollars from my clients.

447
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:39,104
By hacking in their bank accounts.

448
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,731
Isn't it, guys?
- Yes, he hacked in..

449
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,742
..and stole my entire showroom.

450
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,108
Only left the shutters behind.

451
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,277
How do you know about Spider?

452
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:49,441
Hello. I have done
Masters in Ethical Hacking..

453
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:51,644
..and Spider was my thesis project.

454
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,452
Do you know who this Spider
is and where we can find him?

455
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:56,854
I got this close to
finding him couple of times.

456
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,688
Last I heard he was in Hong Kong.

457
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,660
But I lost him
before I could track him.

458
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:04,629
But if you want I can try again.

459
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,328
That's great, Naina. Please Try again.

460
00:32:07,702 --> 00:32:09,192
For all of us.

461
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:33,385
Charlie, I am feeling sleepy.

462
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:37,094
Then get some sleep.
- No, I want coffee.

463
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:55,180
I got him. I got him.

464
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,240
He got the mail. He fell for it.

465
00:32:57,652 --> 00:32:59,586
I hacked his system.

466
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:01,345
Spider is an Indian.

467
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:03,653
And you won't believe it, he's in Goa.

468
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:04,783
What?

469
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:06,492
Can we get his address?

470
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:08,426
His postal address is.

471
00:33:09,797 --> 00:33:13,699
Riviera Society.
Apartment 304. Anjuna.

472
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:15,633
Let's go, guys.

473
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:51,729
You stay near the car.

474
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:53,103
Riya, Bilal.

475
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:55,108
Take the lift and cover his door.

476
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:56,837
Ronny, we will block the stairways.

477
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:16,391
Hey, pizza-boy.

478
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:19,065
Where are you going
without making the delivery?

479
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,458
Ronny, I got him.

480
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:22,366
It's the pizza-boy
and he's coming down.

481
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:15,817
So finally Spider is
caught in the web.

482
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,115
You don't have any
proof that I am Spider.

483
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:20,155
You can't arrest me.

484
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:21,388
We are not the police.

485
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:23,521
Then why are you after me?

486
00:35:23,798 --> 00:35:26,289
We want to tip you, pizza-boy.

487
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:29,535
Worth 100 million.

488
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:36,299
You need a team, Charlie.

489
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:39,211
A team of the world's best players.

490
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:40,805
What the..

491
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:43,482
You can make a palace
out of all that gold.

492
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:45,479
What is the plan?

493
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:47,612
Putting it in one line..

494
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,349
..the plan is that we will
steal the gold from the train..

495
00:35:49,423 --> 00:35:51,288
..in which it is being transported.

496
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:52,652
Are you serious?

497
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:55,262
We are talking about an
international robbery.

498
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:57,355
And if it's Russia's, then the
mafia will be involved as well.

499
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,331
Don't you think this
is a difficult job?

500
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,028
I haven't even started
counting the difficulties.

501
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,230
The gold will be transported in this
truck from the Czar's Winter Palace..

502
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:08,775
..with a military convoy.

503
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:12,678
The gold will be loaded from
this Russian Military Station..

504
00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:15,113
..into this cargo container.

505
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:17,747
There are two locks in the container.

506
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:21,519
Electronic and manual.

507
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:23,748
And the code to this electronic code..

508
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:26,520
..will be given to
one Russian General.

509
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,090
Coming to the train.

510
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:33,095
The container filled with gold..

511
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,634
..will be loaded on this train, and..

512
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:37,170
..there will be two
coaches ahead and behind it.

513
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:39,336
Filled with Russian Commandoes.

514
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:41,272
The train's speed will be set..

515
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:43,640
..and its progress will
be tracked by a satellite.

516
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:47,076
If anything is detected
within a kilometer of its range..

517
00:36:47,114 --> 00:36:48,775
..or if the train
slows down or stops then..

518
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:54,721
..within three minutes Russian
Fighter Jets will be scrambled.

519
00:36:55,389 --> 00:36:56,754
And the Russian government..

520
00:36:56,824 --> 00:37:00,055
..has published this
information in their local papers.

521
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:06,097
So no one imagines
about touching this gold.

522
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,092
But, Charlie, how will we do this?

523
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,032
Your new mobiles.

524
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:16,508
It contains the plan's details,
your individual roles..

525
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:18,704
..and also a basic
Russian speaking course.

526
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,812
If you want to be a big player..

527
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,058
..then you have to take a big risk.

528
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,788
Congratulations, guys.

529
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,593
Soon you each be the
owners of 100 million.

530
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,831
Isn't the gold worth 1 billion

531
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,505
And there are six of us.

532
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,768
Are you deducting TDS?

533
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:49,366
You can say that.

534
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,274
The remaining share belongs to Victor.

535
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,179
Who is Victor?

536
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,545
Consider Victor as the
non-playing captain of this team.

537
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:58,013
Committing this big
robbery without his guidance..

538
00:37:58,085 --> 00:37:59,347
..is impossible.

539
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,788
The most important thing.

540
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:04,054
How will we get out after the robbery?

541
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:06,685
You will know the exit
plan when the time's right.

542
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:12,596
Sorry, guys. Excuse me.

543
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,295
Yes, Naina.
- What Naina?

544
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:19,771
You promised me that
if I find Spider..

545
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,668
..then you will take me out on a date.

546
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:23,676
Naina, I am really sorry.

547
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,541
Even I wanted to meet you..

548
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:27,637
..but something urgent has come up.

549
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:30,446
So I am leaving tomorrow.

550
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:34,121
And you will have to go
alone to receive Victor as well.

551
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:36,051
But where are you going?

552
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:38,752
To make my life's biggest deal.

553
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,722
Russia.

554
00:38:57,578 --> 00:39:01,139
Do you like this train?
- Yes, perfect.

555
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:03,510
They are here.

556
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,223
This is our film unit.

557
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:21,700
The heroine.

558
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,202
Director.

559
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,397
He's the cameraman.

560
00:39:24,472 --> 00:39:25,769
And he's the assistant director.

561
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:30,767
Makeup man and spot boy.

562
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:33,775
You could have at
least made me a star here.

563
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:36,779
Your train.

564
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:40,085
Enjoy your shoot at Russia.

565
00:39:40,154 --> 00:39:41,621
Thank you.

566
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:52,464
Try to understand.

567
00:39:53,601 --> 00:39:55,626
I cannot tell you anything more.

568
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:58,361
All I can say is that..

569
00:39:59,073 --> 00:40:01,701
..after this I will
never disappoint you again.

570
00:40:10,184 --> 00:40:12,652
Can I know who you were talking to?

571
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:36,142
There is just one tunnel between..

572
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,643
..the Russian
Military Base and Romania.

573
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:40,544
And the train will take
only two minutes to cross it.

574
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:41,876
And within these two minutes..

575
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,745
..Ronnie you will have
to perform your trick..

576
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:46,446
..and Spider you will have
to hack the Russian Satellite.

577
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,817
But after I hack into it..

578
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:50,516
..the Russian systems will
be down only for 10 minutes.

579
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:53,351
After that the
systems will restart again.

580
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:57,396
That means we have just 10 minutes..

581
00:40:57,465 --> 00:40:59,524
..to execute the entire robbery.

582
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:07,299
Ticket please.

583
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,185
Thank you.

584
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:30,259
How is the train moving?

585
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:41,507
This magician really is dangerous.

586
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,575
I have replaced the engine.

587
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:54,143
And now I am
installing this power booster.

588
00:41:54,455 --> 00:41:57,583
If all goes well then
this rundown diesel train..

589
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,720
..will run at the speed that we want.

590
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:10,363
Hello.
- Yes, CA, how is everything going?

591
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:13,765
We are working on that,
completely involved in it.

592
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:15,468
Don't get too involved that..

593
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:18,273
..you forget how to get out of there.

594
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:21,776
Understood.
- Yes, sir.

595
00:42:22,716 --> 00:42:23,774
Spider.

596
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,678
Victor has sent the
exit plan. Check it.

597
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,153
Right.

598
00:42:32,526 --> 00:42:33,618
Charlie.

599
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:36,528
Charlie. I have hacked into
the Russian Military website.

600
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:38,795
This is the list of
officers who will be involved..

601
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:41,562
..in the train that
will be carrying the gold.

602
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:44,132
The names are according to the rank.

603
00:42:44,204 --> 00:42:45,364
That means the two
generals on the top..

604
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:47,566
..are security in-charge.
- Yes.

605
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:51,507
Lieutenant General Mikhail Levitski.

606
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,771
And Major General Dimitry Yegorov.

607
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:58,249
Bilal, I need all the
information about these two generals.

608
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:00,146
What they eat? How much they drink?

609
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,212
And most important, where they sleep.

610
00:43:04,525 --> 00:43:05,617
Bilal.

611
00:43:05,693 --> 00:43:10,460
Hey. We need information
about these two generals.

612
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,793
So why are you screaming?

613
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:13,328
Because..

614
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,526
Forget it.

615
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,517
Your drink.
- Come, sit down.

616
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,326
So he's our man.

617
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:46,426
So, Riya.

618
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:49,827
Are you ready to meet general Yegorov?

619
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,797
Of course.

620
00:43:56,276 --> 00:43:57,538
One orange juice.

621
00:44:05,252 --> 00:44:06,446
Nervous.

622
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,785
No. But this waiting.. God.

623
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:14,321
I need a drink.

624
00:44:22,436 --> 00:44:24,529
Charlie, Yegorov is here.

625
00:45:07,815 --> 00:45:11,114
''It's getting hot.''

626
00:45:11,185 --> 00:45:14,313
''I am drinking every
shot in this party.''

627
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:17,516
''I am feeling intoxicated.''

628
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:21,527
''I am so knocked out, my
head is getting heavier.''

629
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:24,725
''No, no, no.''

630
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:28,097
''Wonder what will happen next.''

631
00:45:28,235 --> 00:45:31,204
''I am completely numb.''

632
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,704
''Totally drunk.''

633
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:35,833
''I drank it neat.''

634
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,302
''Stop this English tune.''

635
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:40,812
''Watch me sway.''

636
00:45:41,081 --> 00:45:44,448
''To the local beats.''

637
00:45:52,426 --> 00:45:55,623
''As the night grows.''

638
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:58,755
''I feel intoxicated.''

639
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:02,229
''I cannot see anything clearly.''

640
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:05,430
''My sight is getting hazier.''

641
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:08,635
''I will sway to the fullest.''

642
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:11,803
''I can swing to every corner.''

643
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,173
''Someone better stop me.''

644
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:18,377
''Or I might kiss you.''

645
00:46:18,452 --> 00:46:21,421
''Stop this English tune.''

646
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,115
''Watch me sway.''

647
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:26,684
''To the local beats.''

648
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,645
''Should I fill the empty glasses?''

649
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:58,782
''I think what I should do.''

650
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:02,118
''When I have taken the risk.''

651
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:05,494
''So why be afraid of the world.''

652
00:47:05,566 --> 00:47:08,558
''Should I go this way or that?''

653
00:47:08,635 --> 00:47:12,036
''I don't know which way to go.''

654
00:47:12,105 --> 00:47:18,340
''You tell me how do I go
home in this condition?''

655
00:47:18,478 --> 00:47:21,641
''No, no, no.''

656
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:24,742
''Wonder what will happen next.''

657
00:47:25,118 --> 00:47:28,053
''I am completely numb.''

658
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:29,554
''Totally drunk.''

659
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:32,717
''I drank it neat.''

660
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:36,128
''Stop this English tune.''

661
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:37,663
''Watch me sway.''

662
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:41,258
''To the local beats.''

663
00:47:57,684 --> 00:47:59,515
Have a nice evening.

664
00:48:27,247 --> 00:48:29,112
You have to first sing me a song.

665
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,452
Why do Indians always
mix singing with sex?

666
00:48:34,688 --> 00:48:35,814
I've seen in your movies.

667
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:38,421
Hero gets horny, he sings.

668
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:41,154
Heroine gets horny, she sings.

669
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:42,320
Always.

670
00:48:42,396 --> 00:48:44,057
So you don't like Indians.

671
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,359
I didn't say that.

672
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:54,334
We Russians like all
Raj Kapoor movies.

673
00:48:54,841 --> 00:48:58,368
I have seen 'Mera Naam Joker'.

674
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,772
'Awaara' and 'Sri 420'.

675
00:49:04,051 --> 00:49:07,214
You're lying . Prove it.
- Okay.

676
00:49:08,588 --> 00:49:12,388
''My shoes are Japanese.''

677
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:18,428
''My pants are English.''

678
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:21,597
Thank God there is no
mention of underwear in this song.

679
00:49:22,035 --> 00:49:27,701
''The hat I am wearing is Russian.''

680
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:33,373
''But yet at heart I am an Indian.''

681
00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:37,379
Voice sample recorded.

682
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:43,155
You are looking great.

683
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:58,303
''My shoes are Japanese.''

684
00:49:58,672 --> 00:50:02,574
''My pants are English.''

685
00:50:04,244 --> 00:50:06,838
''The hat I am wearing is Russian.''

686
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:09,408
''The hat I am wearing is Russian.''

687
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:12,517
''But yet at heart I am Indian.''

688
00:50:12,586 --> 00:50:15,714
Not just your hat but
you sound Russian too.

689
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,190
Planning time is over.

690
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:23,852
Players, let's go for the gold.

691
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:50,356
Yegorov's driver is
approaching with the car.

692
00:50:55,462 --> 00:50:56,451
Now.

693
00:51:01,134 --> 00:51:02,294
The spikes have done their job.

694
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:05,127
Now you fix your flat tyre.

695
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:07,139
And our man will pick up Yegorov.

696
00:51:08,075 --> 00:51:12,375
Sunny, it's your turn.
- Okay.

697
00:51:56,456 --> 00:51:58,048
Goodbye.

698
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:02,192
Sleep peacefully for
the next 24 hours.

699
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:19,676
Wow. Great.

700
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:24,408
Okay.
- Perfect.

701
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:26,212
Even his father cannot recognize you..

702
00:52:26,286 --> 00:52:28,083
..otherwise my name isn't Sunny Mehra.

703
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,753
Good luck, Charlie.
- Thanks.

704
00:52:51,778 --> 00:52:53,473
Go, get that file.

705
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:06,515
Not this one, the red one.

706
00:53:14,768 --> 00:53:16,326
Yes, sir, General.

707
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:57,369
Look after Yugorov.

708
00:53:57,444 --> 00:53:59,537
Forget him and
concentrate on your work.

709
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:00,705
Stop joking.

710
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,112
Sunny, be in place at the right time.

711
00:54:03,149 --> 00:54:04,446
Okay?
- Okay.

712
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:34,246
Go check the carriages, immediately.
- Okay, sir.

713
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:47,319
The camera's in place.

714
00:54:48,261 --> 00:54:49,455
Great, Charlie.

715
00:54:49,529 --> 00:54:51,190
Time to put up the flags.

716
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,070
This is the symbol of friendship..

717
00:55:09,149 --> 00:55:10,639
..between Russia and Romania

718
00:55:19,793 --> 00:55:22,193
Crew, about turn.

719
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:51,180
015.

720
00:55:51,257 --> 00:55:53,225
920.

721
00:55:54,294 --> 00:55:55,386
61.

722
00:55:55,528 --> 00:55:56,790
03.

723
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:58,690
58.

724
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:00,760
Great.
- Yeah.

725
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:35,695
Hello.
- Ronnie, the gold train has departed.

726
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,259
Let's get ready.

727
00:57:27,554 --> 00:57:28,646
Alright, guys.

728
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:30,746
I am activating the boosters.

729
00:57:59,752 --> 00:58:01,242
Guys, Tunnel spotted.

730
00:58:01,321 --> 00:58:02,788
I can see the tunnel.

731
00:58:09,128 --> 00:58:11,619
Ronnie, the gold train is
about to enter the tunnel.

732
00:58:11,698 --> 00:58:13,029
Okay.

733
00:58:13,266 --> 00:58:16,599
Ronnie, now everything
depends on your illusion.

734
00:59:08,121 --> 00:59:09,679
Spider, your turn.

735
00:59:16,396 --> 00:59:19,024
Ladies and Gentlemen,
sorry for the interruption.

736
00:59:25,038 --> 00:59:26,232
Oh no.

737
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,235
What's wrong?
- I don't know.

738
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:30,435
Just check, man.

739
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:34,443
Your time starts now.

740
00:59:35,415 --> 00:59:37,280
We have 10 minutes.

741
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,818
Buckle up, guys. I am
increasing the speed.

742
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:49,685
Any result?

743
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:52,220
Sir, system has crashed.
- What?

744
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:53,731
Call the engineer, fast!

745
00:59:58,438 --> 01:00:00,406
Guys, I can see the train.

746
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:53,291
The illusion is working.

747
01:00:53,326 --> 01:00:55,294
They cannot see our train.

748
01:01:06,305 --> 01:01:07,636
Good job.

749
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,680
What happened?
- We lost connection.

750
01:02:10,136 --> 01:02:11,364
Spidey, what is the code?

751
01:02:12,505 --> 01:02:14,063
0159.

752
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,165
0159.

753
01:02:16,242 --> 01:02:17,436
2061.

754
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,535
20.
- 061.

755
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:22,740
61.. next.

756
01:02:22,815 --> 01:02:26,717
0358.
- 0358.

757
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,310
That's it
- Yeah.

758
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:38,327
Let's get him.
- Stop!

759
01:03:01,287 --> 01:03:02,413
Yes, sir.

760
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,217
Is anything wrong there?

761
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:07,158
Everything's okay.

762
01:03:24,777 --> 01:03:26,335
Four minutes.

763
01:03:36,255 --> 01:03:37,449
Ronnie.

764
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:41,285
What happened?

765
01:03:41,427 --> 01:03:43,327
There's a problem with the illusion.
- What?

766
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:54,831
I've rewinded the video.

767
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:15,692
Charlie, we're losing time.

768
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:05,808
Players, Jackpot.

769
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,445
Yes, we did it.

770
01:05:09,715 --> 01:05:11,410
Love you, Charlie.

771
01:05:55,127 --> 01:05:57,095
Soon we will
reconnect with the satellite.

772
01:06:32,131 --> 01:06:33,598
Bilal, watch out.

773
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,839
How will we transfer
rest of the gold now?

774
01:06:50,783 --> 01:06:52,580
Guys, we have just one minute.

775
01:06:52,651 --> 01:06:54,710
And the system will
restart in one minute.

776
01:07:16,509 --> 01:07:19,307
Diversion coming up,
hurry up, Charlie.

777
01:07:21,614 --> 01:07:23,741
Their satellite system
can restart any minute.

778
01:07:29,055 --> 01:07:30,454
Come on, Charlie, hurry up.

779
01:07:32,658 --> 01:07:34,148
Come on.

780
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,231
Come on, Charlie,

781
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:43,830
Hurry up.
- Forget the gold bar and jump.

782
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:45,365
Come on, Charlie.

783
01:07:51,744 --> 01:07:53,769
Take my hand.

784
01:08:12,098 --> 01:08:13,497
Yes. We made it.

785
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,226
Thank you, friend.

786
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:17,201
Come on. Get back to your positions.
Everything is fine.

787
01:09:02,414 --> 01:09:06,407
Sir, I will keep visiting you.
- Yes, why not? Why not?

788
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:41,079
I missed you, papa.

789
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:42,786
I really missed you.

790
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:49,593
What will you do with your share?

791
01:09:49,662 --> 01:09:51,095
I will buy this.

792
01:09:51,163 --> 01:09:53,097
My dream mansion in Wellington.

793
01:09:53,165 --> 01:09:54,427
It's being auctioned next week.

794
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,094
Starting bid is 10 million dollars.

795
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:01,506
Charlie, you shouldn't have taken
such a big risk for one gold bar.

796
01:10:01,807 --> 01:10:04,139
Ronnie, I promised Victor..

797
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:06,842
..I will pay him to the last gram.

798
01:10:09,682 --> 01:10:13,618
How lovely, dear. I missed
you and this house so much..

799
01:10:13,686 --> 01:10:15,347
..in the past 10 years.

800
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:18,288
So better understand the
rules of this house as well.

801
01:10:18,357 --> 01:10:22,453
If you want to talk or
meet someone, only through me.

802
01:10:22,528 --> 01:10:23,722
Okay.

803
01:10:34,306 --> 01:10:36,365
Just eat, that's my order.

804
01:10:36,642 --> 01:10:37,768
Okay.

805
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:44,576
Hello.
- We did it.

806
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:46,208
What did I say, papa?

807
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:49,550
The largest robbery of the century.

808
01:10:50,422 --> 01:10:52,447
1biliion.

809
01:10:52,758 --> 01:10:54,316
1biliion.

810
01:10:56,862 --> 01:10:58,693
Now your dream will be fulfilled.

811
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:01,093
I am so happy.

812
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,561
I wish you were here with us.

813
01:11:10,175 --> 01:11:13,804
Naina, I..
- No, papa. No need to say anything.

814
01:11:14,146 --> 01:11:16,273
I just asked for one thing.

815
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:17,373
Just one promise.

816
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:19,246
That you won't do anything wrong.

817
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:22,116
And you broke that. Just for money.

818
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:25,281
No, Naina, I didn't do this
for money. - Papa, stop lying.

819
01:11:25,357 --> 01:11:26,756
Papa, for the past 10 years..

820
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:30,659
..I stayed away from you just so
that you don't do anything wrong.

821
01:11:31,297 --> 01:11:33,424
But maybe you don't
love your daughter.

822
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:35,763
Give me a chance,
Naina, let me explain.

823
01:11:38,537 --> 01:11:41,097
Alright, to success.

824
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:42,640
To the best team in the world.

825
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,370
To Charlie. The best
player in the world.

826
01:11:45,577 --> 01:11:47,408
Bilal Basheer.

827
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:50,414
You have an opportunity to tell us..

828
01:11:50,482 --> 01:11:53,508
..what you will do
with this 100 million.

829
01:11:53,585 --> 01:11:55,883
I will buy cars worth 50 million.

830
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:59,681
Latest, vintage. Every model.

831
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:02,192
The rest of the money?
- Who will fill petrol in those cars?

832
01:12:02,227 --> 01:12:03,216
Your father?

833
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:07,265
My father won't have time
for these useless things.

834
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:10,393
Because he will now
open a production house.

835
01:12:10,703 --> 01:12:15,163
Hazurilal Mehra
presents Sunny the Superstar.

836
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:19,375
Mr. Magician. Will you
tell us something today..

837
01:12:19,445 --> 01:12:21,709
..or prefer to keep silent.

838
01:12:22,314 --> 01:12:25,283
No, I can tell you today.
- Then tell us.

839
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:27,515
I will build a house.

840
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:33,121
A house that has all the
luxuries of the world.

841
01:12:34,126 --> 01:12:35,821
Where everything's done automatically.

842
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:37,859
At a single call.

843
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,428
You could have done that
with your magic as well.

844
01:12:43,135 --> 01:12:44,602
Magic doesn't do anything.

845
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:47,833
It only ruins lives.

846
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:54,403
'Papa.'

847
01:12:59,284 --> 01:13:01,343
'Gudiya!'

848
01:13:03,055 --> 01:13:06,718
My daughter was paralyzed
forever because of my illusion.

849
01:13:08,193 --> 01:13:09,524
She cannot even move.

850
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:12,753
But I want to give her all
the happiness of the world.

851
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:16,364
Everything she commands is done.

852
01:13:16,769 --> 01:13:19,499
She never feels that
she cannot do anything.

853
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:23,267
That will be my biggest magic trick.

854
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:28,379
Ronnie, I hope you can buy
every happiness for her..

855
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:29,675
..with this money.

856
01:13:36,422 --> 01:13:37,650
I sure will.

857
01:13:40,592 --> 01:13:42,560
And if this money isn't adequate..

858
01:14:28,307 --> 01:14:30,104
You rascal.

859
01:14:57,402 --> 01:14:58,767
Who are they?

860
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:02,634
Whose men are they? You must know.

861
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:06,109
After all, you're the
best player in the world.

862
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:08,507
Oh, come on, Charlie.

863
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:11,681
These poor guys, I mean..

864
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,685
..don't break the hearts of
the best team in the world.

865
01:15:15,187 --> 01:15:19,055
Please tell them their
Shaila has a big heart.

866
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:23,493
And she shares it with others..

867
01:15:24,296 --> 01:15:26,389
..just like her husband's secrets.

868
01:15:26,598 --> 01:15:28,463
'And I told you that..'

869
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:30,802
'..if anything happens to me
send that parcel to Charlie.'

870
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,802
'Pure Romanian Gold. Which is worth..'

871
01:15:36,642 --> 01:15:38,667
'..decent people like us.'

872
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:40,673
And tell them that you knew..

873
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:43,180
..you weren't the only
one at Raj's funeral.

874
01:15:44,316 --> 01:15:45,442
I was there too.

875
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:50,549
And one more thing.

876
01:15:50,856 --> 01:15:53,552
A hacker whom no one
could trace in the world..

877
01:15:53,725 --> 01:15:55,625
..but you just caught
him sitting in your dorm.

878
01:15:55,694 --> 01:15:56,854
Just like that.

879
01:15:57,095 --> 01:16:00,155
And no one felt anything suspicious.

880
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:08,235
You didn't find me. I
told you my whereabouts.

881
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:10,597
'Where are you going
without making the delivery?'

882
01:16:10,676 --> 01:16:12,769
You thought you are after me.

883
01:16:13,378 --> 01:16:17,109
But no, I was ahead of you..

884
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:21,746
..always a step ahead.

885
01:16:22,554 --> 01:16:25,045
Yes, for a moment I felt that..

886
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:29,187
..you will keep some
cards to yourself.

887
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:32,494
'You will know the exit
plan at the right time.'

888
01:16:32,564 --> 01:16:38,525
But then you gave me the
exit plan on a platter.

889
01:16:39,504 --> 01:16:42,337
'Victor has sent the exit plan,
check it. - Right.'

890
01:16:42,407 --> 01:16:46,173
I just slightly
changed that exit plan.

891
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:50,603
This place isn't
according to Victor's exit plan.

892
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,350
It's according to my exit plan.

893
01:16:54,753 --> 01:16:57,244
My place, my men.

894
01:16:57,489 --> 01:17:01,016
And some 30 kilometers away
from here your Victor's men..

895
01:17:01,059 --> 01:17:05,519
..would be dancing around
in the snow with their guns.

896
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:10,734
So come on, Charlie,
the master planner.

897
01:17:11,236 --> 01:17:14,262
Please tell me that you knew this.

898
01:17:14,539 --> 01:17:15,631
No.

899
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:20,704
But I knew that I
can pull off this job.

900
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,744
With my intelligence,
and the courage of my team.

901
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,346
And I did it.

902
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:33,122
And you knew that you
can't pull off this job.

903
01:17:34,259 --> 01:17:37,387
You had just one way to get the gold.

904
01:17:38,664 --> 01:17:39,790
Deceit.

905
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:41,760
Hey, Spider.

906
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:45,064
You can do anything you want with us.

907
01:17:45,837 --> 01:17:50,740
But remember, Victor won't spare you.

908
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,471
I admit that I am the
villain of this story.

909
01:17:55,347 --> 01:17:58,373
But my brother, you
should give me some credit.

910
01:17:58,684 --> 01:18:01,482
I must have thought
something about it.

911
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:04,449
'For the past 10 years I
stayed away from you..'

912
01:18:04,523 --> 01:18:07,014
'..just so that you
don't do anything wrong.'

913
01:18:07,092 --> 01:18:09,322
'But maybe you don't
love your daughter.'

914
01:18:09,795 --> 01:18:11,126
'Naina.'

915
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:18,429
'Dear, stay inside.'

916
01:18:18,503 --> 01:18:19,765
'Stay inside.'

917
01:18:20,038 --> 01:18:22,472
'Papa. Papa.'

918
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:52,796
I am really sad, Charlie.

919
01:19:53,398 --> 01:19:57,698
You lost your Guru, friend
and love in a single day.

920
01:19:59,204 --> 01:20:01,172
Do you still want to live?

921
01:20:47,619 --> 01:20:49,610
Ronnie, Ronnie.

922
01:21:00,832 --> 01:21:03,266
You get the gold, and I will get Riya.

923
01:21:48,446 --> 01:21:49,879
Bye-bye.

924
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:56,733
Naina, I.. - ''I am sorry'',
isn't that what you want to say.

925
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,670
Naina, listen to me.
- Why should I?

926
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,605
And what else should
I forgive you for?

927
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,506
For the fact that for
the past ten years..

928
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:03,976
..you are posing as my father's CA.

929
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:06,442
Or for that fact that my
father broke his promise..

930
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:07,880
..for the greed you gave him.

931
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,883
Naina, I am very close to Spider.

932
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,284
How many times will you
try to explain to me..

933
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,649
..that Spider killed papa?

934
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:17,851
He shot him but you threw
him in front of the barrel.

935
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,860
You killed him, Charlie.
- Naina.

936
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,360
And what I regret is that..

937
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:24,455
..my father agreed just for
some money.. - Enough, Naina.

938
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:28,828
I have no regrets that
you misunderstood me..

939
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:34,739
..but I really regret that
you misunderstood Victor.

940
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:38,368
He didn't break your
promise for money..

941
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,714
..but for his dream.

942
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,944
His dream to build
India's biggest orphanage.

943
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:48,746
So that no child can
become Victor or Charlie again.

944
01:23:50,559 --> 01:23:52,288
And trust me, Naina.

945
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,921
I will fulfill this dream.

946
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:04,861
'Sorry, dear. I
broke my promise to you.'

947
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:07,936
'I wanted to do something.. '

948
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:13,810
'.. so that you feel proud
whenever you think of me.'

949
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,411
'Feel proud, dear.'

950
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:43,006
Your dream will surely be fulfilled.

951
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,970
You will not fulfill
my papa's dream alone.

952
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:57,515
One more thing, Charlie Mascahernas.

953
01:24:57,626 --> 01:25:00,891
I will make Charlie pay for
the gold and papa's death.

954
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:04,331
Till the last gram.

955
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:15,538
Look.. Victor is back.

956
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,912
Here are our passports,
visas and other documents.

957
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:27,852
Where are we going?

958
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,550
New Zealand.

959
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,622
That's where we will
find a clue to catch Spider.

960
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,454
Remember this.

961
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,264
This is the last gold bar
that I picked up from the train.

962
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:45,763
For the past one year I
have been traveling around..

963
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:47,968
..to all the gold
markets in the world..

964
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:51,370
..with a hope to find a
dealer who can get me..

965
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,246
..a similar Romanian gold bar.

966
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:56,840
I found a dealer in Auckland.

967
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,317
'How many do you want? '

968
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,717
'How many can you find? '

969
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:00,845
'Give me a week.'

970
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:02,685
'You call when ready, my
boss will be here for the deal.'

971
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:03,850
'Okay?
- Okay.'

972
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:06,894
And two days ago that dealer called.

973
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:08,958
He wants to meet.

974
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,496
Hello.

975
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:52,564
Yes, we have reached Auckland.

976
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:54,575
We should meet today and do the deal.

977
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:57,342
Yes, my boss is also with me.

978
01:26:57,445 --> 01:26:58,537
Okay.

979
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:00,771
Who is the boss?

980
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:02,907
Come, I will show you who the boss is.

981
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,481
Do you know who the boss is?

982
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,961
This is my boss, Mr. Zhaveri Bazaar.

983
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:50,697
A well-known gold dealer in India.

984
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:52,528
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bazaar.

985
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,201
So, Mr. Bazaar, how many
gold bars would you like to buy?

986
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:25,297
One?

987
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:27,696
One hundred?

988
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:29,863
One thousand?

989
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:35,233
But my price, $40,000 per bar.

990
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:48,381
I got it. No problem.

991
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,856
Boss wants to speak to the
astrologer before the big deal.

992
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,256
We're Indians, see.

993
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,692
Yes, yes, Indians
very religious people.

994
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,827
Hello.
- The microchip is working, Charlie.

995
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:06,271
Yes, it's an auspicious phase.

996
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,508
Let's go, the job's done.

997
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:11,812
The deal is.. on.

998
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:20,484
Boss likes to shake
hands when the deal's done.

999
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:21,714
Oh yes, thank you.

1000
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:22,848
What a stalwart, sir.

1001
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:24,585
You made a deal
without saying a single word.

1002
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:25,785
What a personality?

1003
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,226
My ears were yearning
to hear those words.

1004
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:29,763
I struggled for 15 years.

1005
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:32,858
Finally I found someone
who understood my true worth.

1006
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:36,334
Otherwise people would
shoo me away like a stray dog.

1007
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:38,599
Boss very happy deal done.

1008
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,800
Thank you.

1009
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,303
This way.

1010
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,376
Indians. Very religious, very crazy.

1011
01:29:50,819 --> 01:29:52,446
Good one my Zhaveri Bazaar.

1012
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,283
You acted well.

1013
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:56,619
Now you realized
what a good actor I am.

1014
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,556
But the credit for this
acting goes to the director.

1015
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:01,788
Not bad.

1016
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,561
How long have you been doing this?

1017
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:05,331
Seven years.

1018
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,628
For seven years?

1019
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:10,733
Since I was seven years old.
- Really.

1020
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:17,803
The dealer's call is being traced.

1021
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,369
Pick it up, please.

1022
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,474
Hello. How are you?
- That's him.

1023
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:24,176
That's Spider. Trace it.

1024
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:25,411
I am good, sir.

1025
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:27,614
This time I've got a
really big order for you.

1026
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,184
How big?

1027
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,349
The signal's coming from Singapore.

1028
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:31,790
That means Spider is in Singapore.

1029
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,350
It's a 1000 bars.

1030
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,487
1000 bars? Who is the buyer?

1031
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:36,723
And now it's Mexico.

1032
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:38,389
He's bouncing his signal.

1033
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,491
They're Indians, sir.
- Indians?

1034
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,866
New Zealand. Spider is
right here in New Zealand.

1035
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,370
Really rich man.

1036
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:45,797
It's confirmed order, Sir.

1037
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:47,966
Wellington. He's in Wellington.

1038
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:51,212
Ten more seconds and I can
confirm his exact location.

1039
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,337
It's a confirmed order.

1040
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,744
You checked their backgrounds.

1041
01:30:57,719 --> 01:30:59,482
Five seconds.
- No, Sir.

1042
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:01,317
What? You moron.

1043
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:02,548
Three seconds.

1044
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:03,784
But, sir..

1045
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:09,621
Couldn't he talk for
three more seconds?

1046
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,358
At least we know that
Spider is in Wellington.

1047
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:12,491
What good is that?

1048
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:15,263
Where will we look for him
in this huge Wellington city?

1049
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:16,633
Sunny is right.

1050
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:19,232
We need a clue.

1051
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,366
And we will find that
clue here in Auckland.

1052
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:24,869
Naina, you and I will
raid the dealer's warehouse.

1053
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:26,743
And we? What will we do?

1054
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:30,908
You two will do what
you two always do.

1055
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:39,655
Rascal. I won't spare you.

1056
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:40,751
Say it louder.

1057
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:42,625
Rascal!

1058
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,291
Silent.

1059
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:47,568
What burns turns to ember.
What die down are ashes.

1060
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:51,366
And one who can make those
ashes blowup is called Bilal.

1061
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:53,897
Control yourself.

1062
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,409
Because today if this
Sikh loses his mind..

1063
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,335
..he'll take down many with him.

1064
01:31:58,413 --> 01:31:59,675
Who are you?

1065
01:31:59,781 --> 01:32:01,442
I am India. He's Pakistan.

1066
01:32:01,549 --> 01:32:03,346
And we are fighting, like always.

1067
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:04,947
But why?

1068
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:07,745
When for the last 60
years we never understood..

1069
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:10,450
..why we are fighting
then how can you understand.

1070
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:11,889
Isn't it?
- Nice.

1071
01:32:16,798 --> 01:32:22,327
You're taking this joke seriously.
- Let's go.

1072
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,404
There are at least 150 entries.

1073
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:34,914
Check for deliveries in Wellington.

1074
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,814
Spider's gold comes from there.

1075
01:32:38,987 --> 01:32:40,477
Quick.

1076
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:41,919
There are five entries for Wellington.

1077
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:43,320
And this is the only entry that..

1078
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:44,891
..doesn't have the name
and address of the supplier..

1079
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:46,017
..but the date and time.

1080
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,262
This must be Spider's delivery.
- Yes.

1081
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,763
Check the footage for
the date and time on this.

1082
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:56,362
Rewind it.

1083
01:33:01,276 --> 01:33:02,334
Stop.

1084
01:33:03,378 --> 01:33:04,504
Play.

1085
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,685
That's some girl, Charlie.

1086
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,398
Someone up there.

1087
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,600
Zoom on the number plate of this car.

1088
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:30,632
Write it down.

1089
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:33,265
DZG298.

1090
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:41,776
We are reaching Wellington.

1091
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:44,875
Thanks for the information.
I will see you at the castle.

1092
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,477
Alright, thanks.

1093
01:33:47,522 --> 01:33:48,784
You were right, Charlie.

1094
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:50,517
The registration
number was of Wellington.

1095
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:51,916
By tomorrow we will have
the name and address..

1096
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:53,392
..of that car owner.

1097
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,603
Here's the address.
- Alright, thanks.

1098
01:34:12,246 --> 01:34:15,340
Charlie, I got the
address of that girl.

1099
01:34:15,717 --> 01:34:16,843
Maybe she's the one who
came to make the delivery..

1100
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:18,215
..at the gold dealer.

1101
01:34:18,286 --> 01:34:19,583
Her name is Pamela.

1102
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:51,248
Oh no, check-post.

1103
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:54,917
Where did this car come from?

1104
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,723
By the time we cross this check-post..

1105
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:02,387
..we will surely lose her.

1106
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:14,765
Excuse me, officer.
- Yes.

1107
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,935
Is there a problem,
we're in a bit of a hurry.

1108
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,473
There has been a theft at the museum.

1109
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:19,672
We are checking every car.

1110
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:22,640
Charlie, she is gone.

1111
01:35:23,785 --> 01:35:25,412
Open your boot.

1112
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,720
Naina.

1113
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,725
What the.. She was right here.

1114
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:38,559
Where did she go?

1115
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,664
So, where is it going to be?

1116
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:46,236
Your place or mine?

1117
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:51,403
Take right.
- Oh, your place.

1118
01:35:58,653 --> 01:35:59,779
Stop.

1119
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,426
Here? We're going to do it here?

1120
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:07,454
In your dreams, baby.

1121
01:36:10,198 --> 01:36:11,426
What the..

1122
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,207
Hello.
- Naina, where are you?

1123
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:25,377
Right in front of Spider's web.

1124
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:36,515
The rascal has
bought such a huge palace.

1125
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:38,684
Did he sell all the gold?

1126
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:39,817
Impossible.

1127
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:41,658
Spider is selling only so much..

1128
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:42,855
..that doesn't
attract the Russian mafia..

1129
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:45,831
..or the Russian government.
- Correct.

1130
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:50,663
Bilal, can you arrange
for an x-ray scanner..

1131
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:55,266
..which can detect the where
the gold is in the castle.

1132
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:56,938
I can make that.

1133
01:36:57,612 --> 01:36:59,807
But who will make
the software to run it?

1134
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:04,350
Am I Mr. India, do I look invisible?

1135
01:37:04,452 --> 01:37:06,352
How could we forget?

1136
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:09,821
If she can find Spider then she
can find Spider's gold as well.

1137
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:11,415
Isn't it, Charlie?

1138
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:22,459
He's surely getting
his birthday gift today.

1139
01:37:22,537 --> 01:37:24,903
Just get her a few drinks
and have the fun of your life.

1140
01:37:24,972 --> 01:37:26,337
Boys aren't the only
one who take advantage..

1141
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,670
..sometimes girls do too.

1142
01:37:29,377 --> 01:37:31,504
What do you mean?
- Nothing, just..

1143
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,210
..speaking from personal experience.

1144
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:36,807
Who are you talking about?

1145
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:43,651
On the evening of
your birthday, did I..

1146
01:37:43,758 --> 01:37:45,282
Forget it, Naina, let it be.

1147
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,690
Tell me, Charlie.

1148
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:52,631
Just that..

1149
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:57,502
..you held my hand
and pulled me closer.

1150
01:37:58,306 --> 01:38:02,902
After that.. I stared
in your eyes and said..

1151
01:38:03,778 --> 01:38:08,306
..I love you.. Riya.
- What?

1152
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:22,352
Bilal.
- What happened?

1153
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:24,931
I just saw Riya on this market's CCTV.

1154
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:26,564
Riya?
- Yes, Riya.

1155
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:27,725
What? Are you sure it was Riya?

1156
01:38:27,802 --> 01:38:28,860
I am sure.

1157
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:35,400
This is the shop
where Riya was standing.

1158
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:40,941
There's Riya.

1159
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:13,407
After your car crash..

1160
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:15,671
..spider and his men left from there.

1161
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:21,543
And.. they left me
there thinking I was dead.

1162
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:28,948
I thought everything's over.

1163
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:31,785
And I wanted to finish myself as well.

1164
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,725
But God had other plans.

1165
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:39,263
I had just one motive in life.

1166
01:40:40,668 --> 01:40:42,226
Revenge from Spider.

1167
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,263
That's why I came to
Wellington looking for him.

1168
01:40:45,606 --> 01:40:49,440
But, Riya, it took us
so long to find Spider.

1169
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:51,869
How did you find him all alone?

1170
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:57,776
The grand villa Spider
lives in was my choice.

1171
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,653
'My dream mansion in Wellington.'

1172
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:02,188
'It's being auctioned next week.'

1173
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:04,315
'Starting bid is 10 million dollars.

1174
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:07,555
'Maybe someone will
bid higher than you.'

1175
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:10,328
My doubts were
confirmed when I came here.

1176
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:13,590
He really did buy that mansion.

1177
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:15,802
I was in the truck as well.

1178
01:41:15,870 --> 01:41:18,737
Then why didn't I think of it as well.

1179
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:20,501
It's no use, Sunny.

1180
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:23,608
Spider lives amongst hi-tech security.

1181
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:26,571
That's why even I
couldn't do anything until now.

1182
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:36,379
You will now do what you
couldn't do until now.

1183
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,450
Because you are no longer alone, Riya.

1184
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:10,219
This device can detect
gold kept inside, Charlie.

1185
01:42:10,558 --> 01:42:13,891
But for that we will have
to take it over the gold.

1186
01:42:14,361 --> 01:42:17,296
That means we will have to
get inside Spider's villa.

1187
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:18,729
But how will we do that?

1188
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:20,266
It's possible.

1189
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:21,926
Spider calls a new girl every night..

1190
01:42:22,236 --> 01:42:24,466
..from different
night clubs in the city.

1191
01:42:24,538 --> 01:42:25,971
Sometimes Chinese, sometime Italian..

1192
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,468
..or sometimes Turkish.

1193
01:42:27,575 --> 01:42:30,237
I had a Brazilian waiter friend.

1194
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:32,278
Spider had called her as well.

1195
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:33,437
That's how I know.

1196
01:42:33,547 --> 01:42:37,643
That means we will have to
arrange for a girl. - No.

1197
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:39,749
This is Spider's city.

1198
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:41,783
We cannot trust anyone.

1199
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:43,784
I will go.

1200
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:47,485
I am the only one in this group..

1201
01:42:47,595 --> 01:42:49,324
..whom Spider doesn't recognize.

1202
01:42:49,396 --> 01:42:51,364
And you don't know Spider.

1203
01:42:51,432 --> 01:42:53,024
That's why you are being nave.

1204
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,961
I know what I am saying.

1205
01:42:55,269 --> 01:42:57,794
If you have a better
alternative then let's hear it..

1206
01:42:57,905 --> 01:43:00,430
..if you don't then
just stay out of it.

1207
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:10,750
Riya is right, Naina.

1208
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:12,742
It is not an easy job.

1209
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:14,949
Don't take it personally.

1210
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:16,922
It is personal for me.

1211
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:21,493
I came here only to
avenge my father's death.

1212
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:22,789
And today when I
have the opportunity..

1213
01:43:22,897 --> 01:43:24,228
..you want me to stay put.

1214
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:25,798
No. Never.

1215
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,697
I am going to face that rascal.

1216
01:43:33,974 --> 01:43:35,236
Fine.

1217
01:43:37,912 --> 01:43:42,781
Insy vinsy Spider
crawled up the water spout.

1218
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:48,014
Down came the rain drop
and washed the Spider out.

1219
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:49,919
Washed.

1220
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:52,621
No, no.

1221
01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:01,934
Dress me up, baby.

1222
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:06,298
Excuse me, ma'am. Here's
a bottle of champagne.

1223
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,197
With an invitation card for you.

1224
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:23,340
Are you sure we will
get the car we need?

1225
01:45:24,251 --> 01:45:25,650
Are you sure this is the place?

1226
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,812
This is what my contact told me.

1227
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:29,287
He said that the guy's a genius.

1228
01:45:29,356 --> 01:45:31,221
He can provide us
with every type of car.

1229
01:45:31,959 --> 01:45:33,551
Anybody there?

1230
01:45:33,627 --> 01:45:38,360
The horse, dog and monkey are here.

1231
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:48,934
Don't worry, I will give
them a good makeover..

1232
01:45:49,243 --> 01:45:52,007
..and no one will be
able to recognize them.

1233
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,781
Don't worry, I was
talking about the cars.

1234
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:58,414
I have seen you somewhere.

1235
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:00,384
You must have seen me in Amsterdam.

1236
01:46:00,487 --> 01:46:01,545
But that wasn't me.

1237
01:46:01,655 --> 01:46:03,623
My brother Budh Chopra, B.C.

1238
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:06,488
I am M.C. Mangal Chopra.

1239
01:46:06,593 --> 01:46:08,891
I was born on a
Tuesday night at 11:55.

1240
01:46:08,962 --> 01:46:10,896
And he was born after 12:00.

1241
01:46:10,964 --> 01:46:12,454
So he became 'Budh' (Wednesday).

1242
01:46:12,566 --> 01:46:15,467
Two bodies and one soul.

1243
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:18,665
I won't spare him.
- Who? Your brother?

1244
01:46:18,772 --> 01:46:21,935
No, the one who robbed
my brother's jewelry shop.

1245
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:23,471
Completely ruined him.

1246
01:46:23,544 --> 01:46:25,603
I won't spare him.

1247
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:26,805
I won't spare him.

1248
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,541
Mangal, he isn't the one.

1249
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:31,816
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1250
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:33,648
We're twins after all.

1251
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:35,848
So there's this strong
feeling that exists between us.

1252
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:39,357
Like, 'Ram Aur Shyam',
'Sita Aur Gita', 'Karan Arjun'.

1253
01:46:39,460 --> 01:46:41,724
'Karan Arjun' weren't twins, father.

1254
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:44,925
It was a case of reincarnation.

1255
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:48,264
Father had said that..

1256
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:51,504
..we should interrupt
when elders are speaking.

1257
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:53,832
Are they your children?

1258
01:46:54,608 --> 01:46:56,303
So I was told.

1259
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:59,704
But they are..
- Do you have a doubt?

1260
01:47:00,013 --> 01:47:01,776
No..
- No, you should.

1261
01:47:01,849 --> 01:47:03,214
I do it everyday.

1262
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:04,807
They are like their mother.

1263
01:47:05,519 --> 01:47:08,454
He's Suryaprakash, and
he's Chandraprakash.

1264
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:14,255
She's my wife, Shanti.

1265
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:17,819
Anil Kapoor's step sister. Shakaal.

1266
01:47:19,566 --> 01:47:20,794
Hello.

1267
01:47:21,502 --> 01:47:22,799
Shanti, we have guests.

1268
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:25,736
Show some hospitality.
- Right away.

1269
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:27,773
Tea and onion fritters.

1270
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:31,803
Brother, you do take
ginger in your tea, don't you?

1271
01:47:31,879 --> 01:47:33,744
Yes.

1272
01:47:33,814 --> 01:47:36,647
Okay. Come, sons.
- Mother.

1273
01:47:36,717 --> 01:47:37,911
We will visit the temple today.

1274
01:47:38,218 --> 01:47:39,708
How Indian.

1275
01:47:39,987 --> 01:47:42,387
I modified them as well.

1276
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:44,787
Because cars look in am imported look.

1277
01:47:44,892 --> 01:47:46,951
And foreigners always look good..

1278
01:47:47,227 --> 01:47:48,558
..with Indian values.

1279
01:47:48,762 --> 01:47:52,220
Sir, juice.
- Thank you.

1280
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:54,430
He is our Ramu.

1281
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:57,236
Hello.
- Hello.

1282
01:47:57,337 --> 01:48:00,773
He must be the first Indian
who has enslaved a British.

1283
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:02,206
Did you say anything, son?
- No.

1284
01:48:02,276 --> 01:48:04,870
Greetings, uncle.
- Bless you, son.

1285
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:06,939
So, what car..

1286
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:08,646
Hello. Uncle's gone.

1287
01:48:08,749 --> 01:48:09,773
Tell me which car do you want?

1288
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,818
Cheetah, Swamp deer, dog.

1289
01:48:11,885 --> 01:48:14,718
What do you call that? I want that.
- Rhino.

1290
01:48:15,355 --> 01:48:17,823
Get something to eat, I will ready it.

1291
01:48:17,891 --> 01:48:20,860
Uncle, call aunt.

1292
01:48:33,674 --> 01:48:35,369
Naina's a smart girl.

1293
01:48:35,943 --> 01:48:37,274
She will handle it.

1294
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,382
We've started receiving
signal from the device.

1295
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:55,328
The camera's working as well.

1296
01:49:18,185 --> 01:49:20,585
Look at his car collection.

1297
01:49:20,854 --> 01:49:23,288
Bilal, didn't you
want to buy this car?

1298
01:49:37,204 --> 01:49:38,535
Show me, baby.

1299
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:45,606
Let her in, baby.

1300
01:49:48,615 --> 01:49:50,344
Voice automated villa.

1301
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,480
Ronnie's dream.

1302
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:58,452
The rascal didn't just steal
our gold but also our dreams.

1303
01:49:59,293 --> 01:50:00,419
Next.

1304
01:50:16,176 --> 01:50:17,336
Next.

1305
01:50:20,647 --> 01:50:21,875
Cool it, baby.

1306
01:50:30,824 --> 01:50:32,621
Open the web, baby.

1307
01:50:59,453 --> 01:51:02,684
He's really shining
after stealing our gold.

1308
01:51:03,223 --> 01:51:04,622
Don't worry, Sunny.

1309
01:51:05,559 --> 01:51:08,187
We'll peel of that shine.

1310
01:51:08,462 --> 01:51:09,895
Nice place.

1311
01:51:10,197 --> 01:51:11,824
You are one rich dude.

1312
01:51:13,934 --> 01:51:19,497
There were some fools who
couldn't handle their wealth.

1313
01:51:19,706 --> 01:51:21,571
All thanks to them.

1314
01:51:21,641 --> 01:51:27,477
By the way, what is a
beautiful Indian like you doing here?

1315
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:30,612
I can ask you the same question.

1316
01:51:31,651 --> 01:51:32,948
Well, I am here on business.

1317
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:34,881
I am here to have some fun.

1318
01:51:36,857 --> 01:51:38,347
I like it.

1319
01:51:38,959 --> 01:51:40,324
Come in.

1320
01:52:30,777 --> 01:52:36,682
''Why is distance between us?''

1321
01:52:37,717 --> 01:52:44,316
''Let's come closer.''

1322
01:52:44,691 --> 01:52:50,755
''Feel it in every breath.''

1323
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:58,333
''My intoxication.''

1324
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:02,670
''My charm always works.''

1325
01:53:02,742 --> 01:53:06,234
''My beauty is alluring.''

1326
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:14,413
''My Beauty will make you sway.''

1327
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:39,975
''The passion that's burning in me.''

1328
01:53:41,548 --> 01:53:47,680
''You will experience it too.''

1329
01:53:47,787 --> 01:53:51,018
''You will soon know why lovers..

1330
01:53:51,324 --> 01:54:00,926
..intentionally lay down
their lives for their love.''

1331
01:54:01,568 --> 01:54:04,833
''I am life and death.''

1332
01:54:04,905 --> 01:54:08,397
''I am your beginning and end.''

1333
01:54:08,475 --> 01:54:16,644
''Come in my refuge and sway.''

1334
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:49,915
''I am lonely and so are you.''

1335
01:54:50,016 --> 01:54:52,814
''It's a beautiful opportunity.''

1336
01:54:53,954 --> 01:55:00,382
''Let's get to know each other.''

1337
01:55:00,493 --> 01:55:06,625
''I don't know how and when
I lost my heart to you.''

1338
01:55:07,801 --> 01:55:13,762
''I never realized it.''

1339
01:55:14,207 --> 01:55:17,574
''My innocent heart fell for you.''

1340
01:55:17,677 --> 01:55:20,942
''The real culprit got acquitted.''

1341
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:29,451
''Just take my life
and keep on swaying.''

1342
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:46,238
The gold is surely behind those doors.

1343
01:55:47,707 --> 01:55:50,676
First the bed, baby. Then the Jacuzzi.

1344
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,777
Close it, baby.

1345
01:55:57,317 --> 01:55:58,477
Come on, Naina.

1346
01:56:02,889 --> 01:56:04,720
Come on, Naina.

1347
01:56:11,698 --> 01:56:12,790
Found it.

1348
01:56:12,866 --> 01:56:14,857
The underground vault is
below the rascal's Jacuzzi.

1349
01:56:23,610 --> 01:56:25,510
Send Naina the signal to come out.

1350
01:56:35,622 --> 01:56:36,953
Hello, everybody.

1351
01:56:37,957 --> 01:56:39,549
Oh, Charlie.

1352
01:56:40,226 --> 01:56:44,253
Just like you sent Riya
to General Yueberhoff..

1353
01:56:45,265 --> 01:56:48,723
..similarly you sent her to me.

1354
01:56:52,272 --> 01:56:53,466
Everybody out.

1355
01:56:53,973 --> 01:56:55,372
I said out.

1356
01:57:41,554 --> 01:57:45,490
Welcome to my web,
says spider to the fly.

1357
01:57:46,526 --> 01:57:48,892
When I found out that you are alive..

1358
01:57:48,995 --> 01:57:52,692
..and here in Wellington,
I was really happy.

1359
01:57:53,366 --> 01:57:56,301
Spider, my car was
followed from home this morning.

1360
01:57:56,369 --> 01:57:57,495
No you dumb woman.

1361
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,265
You're being followed from Auckland.

1362
01:58:03,543 --> 01:58:05,909
The dealer who told you about me..

1363
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:09,238
..also told me about you.

1364
01:58:09,682 --> 01:58:11,513
And now that you are here..

1365
01:58:11,584 --> 01:58:14,314
..I felt that I will face
action once again in life.

1366
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,683
But, Charlie.

1367
01:58:15,789 --> 01:58:18,485
The same old tricks,
the same thinking.

1368
01:58:18,591 --> 01:58:20,889
And because of your foolishness..

1369
01:58:21,194 --> 01:58:24,960
..first that idiot Ronnie
and then that old Victor..

1370
01:58:28,635 --> 01:58:31,536
Next time you take my
papa's name, do it with respect.

1371
01:58:34,207 --> 01:58:35,265
What are you staring at?

1372
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:37,605
You should be thankful
that it was my left hand.

1373
01:58:41,381 --> 01:58:42,939
Open the door, baby.

1374
01:58:48,421 --> 01:58:50,821
Oh. Charlie has got a gun now.

1375
01:58:50,924 --> 01:58:53,552
What will he do? Shoot me.
Come on, shoot me.

1376
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:57,457
You will surely, but not so easily.

1377
01:58:58,965 --> 01:59:03,664
First, I will steal the
thing that's most dear to you.

1378
01:59:05,538 --> 01:59:09,201
Your gold, to the last gram.

1379
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:13,811
Gone. In the next 48 hours.

1380
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:15,813
An open challenge?

1381
01:59:16,583 --> 01:59:17,845
Man to man.

1382
01:59:18,418 --> 01:59:19,680
Player to player.

1383
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:22,787
But don't you think
48 hours is too less.

1384
01:59:22,889 --> 01:59:25,619
I mean what can you
possibly do in two days..

1385
01:59:25,692 --> 01:59:30,527
When I can bypass your world
class security in two minutes..

1386
01:59:31,865 --> 01:59:34,595
..imagine what I can do in two days.

1387
01:59:35,235 --> 01:59:37,829
For the first time you
impressed me, Charlie, I like it.

1388
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:42,838
48 hours.

1389
01:59:43,376 --> 01:59:44,934
And your time starts now.

1390
01:59:45,778 --> 01:59:46,938
Tick-tock.

1391
01:59:47,213 --> 01:59:48,339
Tick-tock.

1392
01:59:48,848 --> 01:59:50,679
You keep a watch on the clock.

1393
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:52,542
And I will keep my eye on the gold.

1394
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:59,221
Bilal, I think my watch is fast.

1395
01:59:59,292 --> 02:00:01,419
How many hours left to 48 hours?

1396
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:04,261
This is the 12th time you
are asking in the last 6 hours.

1397
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:06,389
Sorry, but I am slightly tense.

1398
02:00:06,499 --> 02:00:08,763
He proudly said 48 hours to him..

1399
02:00:08,835 --> 02:00:10,200
..but I hope we don't
make a fool of ourselves.

1400
02:00:10,303 --> 02:00:13,397
And if he wanted to say,
he could have said 72.

1401
02:00:13,506 --> 02:00:14,700
He could have said 96.

1402
02:00:14,774 --> 02:00:16,799
But no, he had to say 48..

1403
02:00:18,578 --> 02:00:20,307
I was explaining to him..

1404
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:24,646
..if Charlie has said 48 then he
must have thought of something.

1405
02:00:25,385 --> 02:00:26,511
Sunny.

1406
02:00:29,255 --> 02:00:30,620
I thought about it before speaking.

1407
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:32,589
It will take Debrovsky that long..

1408
02:00:32,692 --> 02:00:34,250
..to come here from Moscow.

1409
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:39,225
Bilal, call Debrovsky.

1410
02:00:39,465 --> 02:00:41,831
Tell him that the gold
he's been looking for..

1411
02:00:41,868 --> 02:00:45,770
..for the past one year
is here in Wellington.

1412
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:47,672
And if he wants it..

1413
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:50,265
..then he should
come here in 48 hours.

1414
02:00:51,411 --> 02:00:53,402
What are you saying, Charlie?

1415
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:54,808
If the Russian Mafia arrive..

1416
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:56,905
..then they will take all the gold.

1417
02:00:57,517 --> 02:01:00,247
Our first motive to
come here was revenge..

1418
02:01:00,653 --> 02:01:02,280
..and not to steal the gold.

1419
02:01:03,323 --> 02:01:04,585
Charlie is right.

1420
02:01:04,691 --> 02:01:05,919
It's not about the gold.

1421
02:01:06,192 --> 02:01:07,887
We should call Debrovsky.

1422
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:09,889
This time you stay out of it, Naina.

1423
02:01:10,597 --> 02:01:12,724
We stole the gold amidst
the military commandoes..

1424
02:01:12,799 --> 02:01:14,391
..and not you.

1425
02:01:14,901 --> 02:01:16,892
Charlie, shall we
accept defeat so easily.

1426
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:19,902
Some things are bigger
than winning and losing, Riya.

1427
02:01:21,908 --> 02:01:23,500
Call Debrovsky.

1428
02:02:08,788 --> 02:02:11,484
Someday you will surely kill me.

1429
02:02:11,557 --> 02:02:12,785
Don't worry, baby.

1430
02:02:12,859 --> 02:02:15,487
This gun's still
loaded with rubber bullets.

1431
02:02:23,736 --> 02:02:26,000
You must have heard
everything through this microphone.

1432
02:02:26,606 --> 02:02:28,733
Charlie Mascarenhas.

1433
02:02:29,409 --> 02:02:30,501
What a loser.

1434
02:02:30,576 --> 02:02:32,567
He informed the Russian Mafia.

1435
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:36,877
Sorry, baby. I couldn't hold
them for long. - It's okay.

1436
02:02:37,417 --> 02:02:39,681
Neither him nor the Russian Mafia..

1437
02:02:39,786 --> 02:02:41,549
..can reach my gold.

1438
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:46,956
Our gold, not yours.

1439
02:02:49,262 --> 02:02:50,820
Now that's what I like about you.

1440
02:02:51,664 --> 02:02:53,029
Your attitude.

1441
02:02:53,566 --> 02:02:55,500
But, what now?

1442
02:02:55,568 --> 02:02:58,799
I already have.

1443
02:02:59,472 --> 02:03:01,303
Now that's what I like about you.

1444
02:03:01,607 --> 02:03:02,904
You're fast.

1445
02:03:06,813 --> 02:03:09,577
Bad news.
- What now?

1446
02:03:09,649 --> 02:03:11,344
I have just received
news from my contact that..

1447
02:03:11,417 --> 02:03:13,476
..Spider has hired an armor
truck from Ace Securities.

1448
02:03:13,553 --> 02:03:17,284
That means he's shifting
his gold before 48 hours.

1449
02:03:17,657 --> 02:03:18,954
Don't panic, Sunny.

1450
02:03:21,260 --> 02:03:22,557
That's good news.

1451
02:03:23,896 --> 02:03:27,525
Now we will rob the gold
from the streets of Wellington.

1452
02:03:29,268 --> 02:03:31,429
Just like we did in India.

1453
02:03:32,638 --> 02:03:34,299
In broad daylight.

1454
02:03:35,575 --> 02:03:36,735
Wow.

1455
02:03:38,611 --> 02:03:40,306
What an idea, Charlie?

1456
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:42,639
You thought of this so quickly.

1457
02:03:43,015 --> 02:03:44,642
Now that's what I like about you.

1458
02:03:44,717 --> 02:03:45,911
You are fast.

1459
02:03:49,288 --> 02:03:51,483
You are the fastest, baby.

1460
02:03:52,358 --> 02:03:53,552
What a bitch.

1461
02:03:53,926 --> 02:03:55,826
Now explain the plan in detail.

1462
02:03:57,630 --> 02:03:58,858
Plan no.1.

1463
02:03:59,799 --> 02:04:02,962
Sunny, get all the maps of this city.

1464
02:04:03,536 --> 02:04:04,901
Maps for the roads.

1465
02:04:05,338 --> 02:04:07,568
And maps for the
tunnels below the roads.

1466
02:04:36,369 --> 02:04:37,631
Bilal.

1467
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:52,884
How could this be closed?

1468
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:57,551
According to the map
there should be a road here.

1469
02:04:58,024 --> 02:04:59,457
Mark it.

1470
02:05:06,833 --> 02:05:08,425
Plan no.2.

1471
02:05:09,602 --> 02:05:12,730
Naina, tomorrow you will have to turn
Wellington to Mumbai for some hours.

1472
02:05:13,306 --> 02:05:15,797
Wellington's biggest traffic jam.

1473
02:05:16,609 --> 02:05:17,667
It will be done, Charlie.

1474
02:05:17,777 --> 02:05:20,678
And anyway, we Indians
love causing a traffic jam.

1475
02:05:30,923 --> 02:05:32,413
Plan no.3.

1476
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:37,421
Riya, you begin our exit plan.

1477
02:05:38,464 --> 02:05:40,557
You will find a ship
with the help of Bilal..

1478
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:43,226
..which we will use to
transport gold out of New Zealand.

1479
02:05:43,302 --> 02:05:45,532
Here's your money.
- Okay.

1480
02:05:46,839 --> 02:05:48,306
Thanks.
- Thanks.

1481
02:05:48,474 --> 02:05:49,600
That's your ship.

1482
02:05:53,512 --> 02:05:55,309
And the most important.

1483
02:05:55,781 --> 02:05:58,011
We will have to arrange for cars..

1484
02:05:58,517 --> 02:06:02,578
..that look small but
are the fastest on road.

1485
02:06:42,428 --> 02:06:43,486
Amazing.

1486
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:44,858
Perfect timing, Charlie.

1487
02:06:47,266 --> 02:06:48,392
Even with all the weight..

1488
02:06:48,501 --> 02:06:49,798
..the cars didn't slowdown at all.

1489
02:06:49,902 --> 02:06:51,233
Did you see?

1490
02:06:51,304 --> 02:06:53,636
The marvel of my mice.

1491
02:06:53,706 --> 02:06:55,833
They can get in anything,
get out of anything..

1492
02:06:55,908 --> 02:06:58,001
..and carry any number of weight.

1493
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:00,006
If you use them in a race..

1494
02:07:00,313 --> 02:07:02,338
..they will surely win the gold.

1495
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:03,847
That is exactly what we want to do.

1496
02:07:06,419 --> 02:07:07,613
There was another thing.

1497
02:07:07,687 --> 02:07:08,915
Tell me.

1498
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:14,625
Great.

1499
02:07:15,461 --> 02:07:16,621
You've been promoted.

1500
02:07:16,696 --> 02:07:19,324
I will get all the gold in this.

1501
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:22,795
Do your legs reach down there?
- Yes.

1502
02:07:22,868 --> 02:07:24,802
Of course they do.

1503
02:07:36,749 --> 02:07:39,411
'Can I know who you are talking to? '

1504
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:52,324
'She might have gone home.'

1505
02:07:55,334 --> 02:07:59,930
'My daughter cannot
pick up the phone.'

1506
02:08:01,307 --> 02:08:02,774
'There's a nurse
that stays with her.. '

1507
02:08:03,376 --> 02:08:05,503
'.. who calls me up
and lets her talk to me.'

1508
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:09,905
'But if this is against your rules.. '

1509
02:08:10,716 --> 02:08:12,650
'.. then I will tell
her not to call me.'

1510
02:08:13,586 --> 02:08:17,750
'After all, I am doing this for her.'

1511
02:08:18,824 --> 02:08:20,519
'There is no such rule.. '

1512
02:08:21,927 --> 02:08:24,191
'.. that can stop a father
from talking to her daughter.'

1513
02:08:31,871 --> 02:08:33,270
Hey, Supergirl.

1514
02:08:33,372 --> 02:08:35,465
I don't want to talk to you.

1515
02:08:35,841 --> 02:08:37,604
Seems like Gudiya is angry with me.

1516
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,768
Of course.

1517
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:40,505
You have been fooling me
for the past one week.

1518
02:08:40,613 --> 02:08:42,308
''I will come soon, I will come soon.''

1519
02:08:42,415 --> 02:08:44,406
When will you come back to me?

1520
02:08:47,253 --> 02:08:48,311
Soon.

1521
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:50,947
And the surprise that you
were supposed to bring along?

1522
02:08:53,225 --> 02:08:55,557
I stayed away from you
because of that surprise.

1523
02:08:56,462 --> 02:08:57,827
It's a big surprise.

1524
02:08:58,464 --> 02:09:02,161
That's why it took
really long to get it.

1525
02:09:02,334 --> 02:09:04,802
And you will teach me magic when
you come this time, won't you?

1526
02:09:04,870 --> 02:09:06,929
I have told all my friends..

1527
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:09,400
..that I will become a
magician when I grow up.

1528
02:09:09,475 --> 02:09:10,703
Just like my papa.

1529
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:13,608
There is no one else like my papa.

1530
02:09:13,712 --> 02:09:16,510
Yes or no?
- Yes, dear.

1531
02:09:19,318 --> 02:09:20,945
There is no one like your papa.

1532
02:09:27,927 --> 02:09:30,487
Bye, dear.
- Bye.

1533
02:09:43,742 --> 02:09:46,404
This one's for Ronnie and Victor.

1534
02:09:46,745 --> 02:09:48,212
Cheers.

1535
02:09:54,987 --> 02:09:56,614
May the best player win.

1536
02:10:33,392 --> 02:10:34,586
Hurry up, boys.

1537
02:10:39,798 --> 02:10:40,856
Sunny, come in.

1538
02:10:40,966 --> 02:10:42,900
Sunny, here. Go ahead.

1539
02:10:42,968 --> 02:10:45,528
Are you in position?
- Yes, of course.

1540
02:10:45,638 --> 02:10:47,538
I am waiting for the gold.

1541
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:02,550
Charlie, you were right.

1542
02:11:02,621 --> 02:11:03,883
Game on, guys.

1543
02:11:04,657 --> 02:11:06,249
Naina, follow the truck.

1544
02:11:06,325 --> 02:11:07,587
Okay.

1545
02:11:38,224 --> 02:11:39,555
Welcome to Mumbai.

1546
02:11:47,833 --> 02:11:49,232
Oh no.

1547
02:11:55,674 --> 02:11:57,232
What the hell is going on?

1548
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:06,979
Check the system.

1549
02:12:07,253 --> 02:12:08,743
Check quickly.

1550
02:12:18,297 --> 02:12:19,787
God damn it, you..

1551
02:12:19,898 --> 02:12:21,422
You wanted to right, didn't you?

1552
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:23,263
Now you will go left.

1553
02:12:32,244 --> 02:12:34,542
Sunny, my job's done and yours begins.

1554
02:12:34,613 --> 02:12:35,739
Okay.

1555
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:39,545
Come to me, my darling.

1556
02:12:39,652 --> 02:12:41,643
Come and give me the gold.

1557
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:52,863
Move it, move it.

1558
02:13:11,684 --> 02:13:13,345
Ready for the race, guys.

1559
02:13:54,693 --> 02:13:56,752
At the count of three, sharp left.

1560
02:13:57,763 --> 02:13:58,991
Three.

1561
02:13:59,665 --> 02:14:00,723
Two.

1562
02:14:01,333 --> 02:14:02,493
One, go.

1563
02:14:14,446 --> 02:14:16,539
Oh no. Not again. God dam it.

1564
02:14:16,648 --> 02:14:18,479
Why are you getting angry?

1565
02:14:18,584 --> 02:14:20,779
Just a little bit more.

1566
02:14:31,764 --> 02:14:34,232
Bilal.
- I am ready.

1567
02:14:34,299 --> 02:14:36,790
Sunny, bring the truck on the mark.
- Okay.

1568
02:14:40,305 --> 02:14:43,672
Charlie, he's ready to
plunge in the tunnel.

1569
02:15:18,644 --> 02:15:19,838
Okay, bye.

1570
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:21,378
See you later.

1571
02:15:35,828 --> 02:15:37,591
What a plan, Charlie.

1572
02:15:37,663 --> 02:15:40,860
I never realized
when you stole my gold.

1573
02:15:44,369 --> 02:15:47,702
Gift. Gift. Gift. Its here,
its here, its here.

1574
02:15:47,773 --> 02:15:49,400
What are you doing here?

1575
02:15:49,641 --> 02:15:50,699
Just do as we told you..

1576
02:15:50,809 --> 02:15:51,867
..and get to the place
where you were supposed to be.

1577
02:15:51,977 --> 02:15:53,911
Just let me see the gold once.

1578
02:15:53,979 --> 02:15:55,469
And then I will leave.

1579
02:15:55,581 --> 02:15:57,572
Sunny, the gold isn't in the truck.

1580
02:15:58,584 --> 02:15:59,642
The truck is empty.

1581
02:15:59,751 --> 02:16:00,843
Empty?

1582
02:16:00,953 --> 02:16:02,944
I checked the tire
pressure of the truck..

1583
02:16:03,255 --> 02:16:05,189
..while entering and
exiting the villa.

1584
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:06,382
They were both the same.

1585
02:16:06,458 --> 02:16:08,187
They why did you heist this truck?

1586
02:16:08,293 --> 02:16:10,557
So that the bird hovering above you..

1587
02:16:10,629 --> 02:16:12,722
..thinks that we have
fallen for his trap.

1588
02:16:12,831 --> 02:16:14,765
And now he can
easily get the gold out.

1589
02:16:14,867 --> 02:16:16,926
That means he's shifting
the gold from somewhere else?

1590
02:16:17,236 --> 02:16:18,464
Let's go.

1591
02:16:28,647 --> 02:16:31,207
Pamela, get the gold.

1592
02:16:31,517 --> 02:16:34,509
And come straight to my airstrip.
- Sure, boss.

1593
02:16:44,763 --> 02:16:45,923
Yes, Pamela.

1594
02:16:46,231 --> 02:16:47,698
We're coming out.

1595
02:16:47,733 --> 02:16:49,928
Yes, we're ready at the exit point.

1596
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:57,834
Move.

1597
02:17:04,416 --> 02:17:05,508
The truck's coming.

1598
02:17:06,184 --> 02:17:07,481
Get ready.

1599
02:17:09,555 --> 02:17:11,352
Three, two, one.

1600
02:17:56,268 --> 02:17:57,895
Get ready to die.

1601
02:18:10,949 --> 02:18:12,678
That was my right.

1602
02:18:30,335 --> 02:18:31,495
Hello.

1603
02:18:33,372 --> 02:18:34,566
Hello.

1604
02:18:35,974 --> 02:18:37,441
Speak up you bitch.

1605
02:18:37,776 --> 02:18:39,437
Your bitch is gone.

1606
02:18:43,415 --> 02:18:44,882
You're next.

1607
02:18:45,817 --> 02:18:47,910
Who?
- Your father.

1608
02:18:52,257 --> 02:18:53,884
I am taking your gold.

1609
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:56,525
Do whatever you like.

1610
02:19:00,866 --> 02:19:02,333
Charlie.

1611
02:19:03,935 --> 02:19:05,197
Yes, boss.

1612
02:19:05,303 --> 02:19:07,203
Sam you fool, the
gold has been stolen.

1613
02:19:07,372 --> 02:19:09,431
Go inside and kill them.
- Okay, boss.

1614
02:19:09,641 --> 02:19:10,835
Come on, guys.

1615
02:20:09,367 --> 02:20:12,700
Come on, come on, all the best.

1616
02:20:12,771 --> 02:20:15,296
Come on, throw it, throw it.

1617
02:20:23,782 --> 02:20:25,511
Great, they fell down.

1618
02:22:15,827 --> 02:22:17,886
Hello.
- Charlie, where are you?

1619
02:22:17,996 --> 02:22:19,623
We are reaching Marina Bay.

1620
02:22:19,764 --> 02:22:21,698
Is everything ready?
- Absolutely.

1621
02:22:21,766 --> 02:22:23,427
I am waiting for you.

1622
02:22:24,302 --> 02:22:25,394
Marina Bay.

1623
02:22:29,741 --> 02:22:32,369
Careful, guys, don't hurt them.

1624
02:24:29,995 --> 02:24:31,895
Surprise. Surprise.

1625
02:24:32,564 --> 02:24:35,897
It's become a habit for me
to bring twist in the story.

1626
02:24:36,001 --> 02:24:41,268
Just like it's become your habit
to become predictable, Charlie.

1627
02:24:42,574 --> 02:24:44,565
There's another surprise for you.

1628
02:24:44,909 --> 02:24:47,639
Your old friend.

1629
02:24:56,755 --> 02:25:00,782
You thought you met her
again in the Mini Market.

1630
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:03,860
But forgive me, friends.

1631
02:25:04,529 --> 02:25:09,193
She was actually keeping
a watch on all of you.

1632
02:25:12,837 --> 02:25:14,395
Why did you do this?

1633
02:25:14,606 --> 02:25:16,506
I didn't have a choice, Charlie.

1634
02:25:17,242 --> 02:25:18,504
What could I do?

1635
02:25:19,344 --> 02:25:23,474
A helpless girl who had
to face the world alone..

1636
02:25:23,915 --> 02:25:27,248
..she had to fulfill her
dreams and of her old parents.

1637
02:25:30,522 --> 02:25:32,649
Isn't that the kind of
story you want to hear?

1638
02:25:33,224 --> 02:25:37,718
Crap. The truth is I always
wanted to be with the winner.

1639
02:25:38,229 --> 02:25:41,460
And that night in
Moscow's club I found my winner.

1640
02:25:45,804 --> 02:25:46,896
'Nervous.'

1641
02:25:47,005 --> 02:25:47,903
'No.'

1642
02:25:47,972 --> 02:25:50,372
'But this waiting is.'

1643
02:25:54,612 --> 02:25:55,874
'I need a drink.'

1644
02:25:59,951 --> 02:26:01,578
'Sorry.
- It's okay. '

1645
02:26:04,756 --> 02:26:06,656
'One apple martini please. .'

1646
02:26:06,758 --> 02:26:08,316
'Spider, give me a cigarette.'

1647
02:26:08,426 --> 02:26:09,757
'I don't smoke.'

1648
02:26:12,597 --> 02:26:14,428
'Then whose packet is this? '

1649
02:26:18,770 --> 02:26:20,203
'And what is this? '

1650
02:26:25,343 --> 02:26:27,903
'Our exit plan after the robbery.'

1651
02:26:29,914 --> 02:26:31,677
'Smart, Spider.'

1652
02:26:33,585 --> 02:26:36,577
'What if I don't
tell this to anyone? '

1653
02:26:38,923 --> 02:26:40,652
Actually speaking I
did have a choice..

1654
02:26:40,758 --> 02:26:42,851
..and I could have told
you about Spider's plan.

1655
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:45,888
But the mission was
impossible without Spider.

1656
02:26:46,464 --> 02:26:48,261
And what would I get in return?

1657
02:26:48,633 --> 02:26:51,397
Z E R O.

1658
02:26:51,503 --> 02:26:52,663
That means just for the money you..

1659
02:26:52,770 --> 02:26:54,670
Shut up. Stop this charade.

1660
02:26:54,772 --> 02:26:55,864
Tell me where is it?

1661
02:26:55,974 --> 02:26:58,670
It's a big place, it can be anywhere.

1662
02:27:01,813 --> 02:27:03,246
Where is my gold?

1663
02:27:25,503 --> 02:27:26,697
Where is the gold?

1664
02:27:31,209 --> 02:27:32,836
What the.. Where is the gold?

1665
02:27:33,978 --> 02:27:35,775
Surprise. Surprise.

1666
02:27:38,583 --> 02:27:41,211
If the gold isn't in the
car then where is it, Spider?

1667
02:27:45,523 --> 02:27:46,854
Sorry, Riya.

1668
02:27:47,825 --> 02:27:49,793
I didn't have a choice either.

1669
02:27:51,362 --> 02:27:53,728
You were sitting on 500 million.

1670
02:27:54,432 --> 02:27:58,368
So why did you have to steal the
painting from the Wellington Museum?

1671
02:27:58,803 --> 02:28:00,327
'She is leaving.'

1672
02:28:03,208 --> 02:28:04,607
You could've retired.

1673
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:10,345
But then, only
policemen retire, not thieves.

1674
02:28:10,582 --> 02:28:14,313
He knew. He knew everything
about you, you dumb woman.

1675
02:28:16,521 --> 02:28:18,648
Why are you scolding
this dumb woman, Spider?

1676
02:28:19,190 --> 02:28:21,249
She was helpless before her habit.

1677
02:28:21,459 --> 02:28:23,222
You are the real fool.

1678
02:28:23,695 --> 02:28:26,664
Who asked you to put up
that same stolen painting..

1679
02:28:26,764 --> 02:28:29,198
..in your villa?

1680
02:28:29,634 --> 02:28:31,534
Open the door, baby.

1681
02:28:34,505 --> 02:28:38,464
500 million, and what
does he put up in his villa?

1682
02:28:38,977 --> 02:28:40,706
A stolen painting?

1683
02:28:42,580 --> 02:28:44,707
There's a limit to being cheap.

1684
02:28:46,918 --> 02:28:48,818
Speechless after hearing all this.

1685
02:28:49,921 --> 02:28:51,718
But I hope your watch is working.

1686
02:28:52,257 --> 02:28:53,315
Tick-tock.

1687
02:28:53,391 --> 02:28:54,483
Tick-tock.

1688
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:59,526
There's still one
hour left to 48 hours.

1689
02:29:01,666 --> 02:29:04,260
Do you know what your
biggest problem is, Spider?

1690
02:29:05,637 --> 02:29:07,502
You're always ahead.

1691
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:10,398
And the one who walks ahead..

1692
02:29:10,508 --> 02:29:14,376
..never realize when the
entire game has changed behind them.

1693
02:29:16,681 --> 02:29:19,172
And as far as the twist in
the story is concerned..

1694
02:29:20,551 --> 02:29:23,748
..how can you forget that the
last twist belongs to the hero..

1695
02:29:24,756 --> 02:29:26,656
..and not the villain.

1696
02:29:31,195 --> 02:29:36,326
Now even a fool like you
can understand this twist.

1697
02:29:39,704 --> 02:29:45,472
I gave you the information
that you wanted to hear.

1698
02:29:46,344 --> 02:29:47,902
'Call Debrovsky.'

1699
02:29:56,587 --> 02:29:59,681
I knew that Spider
would come out of his web..

1700
02:30:00,258 --> 02:30:02,556
..after hearing
about the Russian mafia.

1701
02:30:03,494 --> 02:30:04,756
And you did.

1702
02:30:05,263 --> 02:30:08,391
How predictable.

1703
02:30:08,533 --> 02:30:09,761
No, Charlie.

1704
02:30:10,268 --> 02:30:12,463
I will tell you who is predictable.

1705
02:30:12,870 --> 02:30:15,771
I can point a gun at
anyone here I want.

1706
02:30:16,674 --> 02:30:20,838
But I will point this gun
at..the bitch who betrayed you.

1707
02:30:25,516 --> 02:30:26,949
What are you doing, Spider?

1708
02:30:28,252 --> 02:30:29,310
Quiet.

1709
02:30:29,387 --> 02:30:31,378
Your expiry date is gone.

1710
02:30:31,556 --> 02:30:33,251
And anyway, you have
already given me..

1711
02:30:33,358 --> 02:30:35,292
..all the information you
had to in the last six months.

1712
02:30:35,393 --> 02:30:37,224
And as far as loyalty is concerned..

1713
02:30:37,328 --> 02:30:41,526
..so when you can betray
a nice guy like Charlie..

1714
02:30:41,899 --> 02:30:43,366
..then how can you be loyal to me?

1715
02:30:47,305 --> 02:30:50,502
Chill bitch, this time there
are real bullets in the gun.

1716
02:30:53,778 --> 02:30:55,405
Did I break your heart?

1717
02:30:58,483 --> 02:31:01,213
Charlie, do you know..

1718
02:31:01,252 --> 02:31:03,550
..why she asked me to put up
that charade of fake bullets?

1719
02:31:03,654 --> 02:31:06,214
Because she didn't want to
break your heart, Charlie.

1720
02:31:06,591 --> 02:31:08,752
She didn't want you to
know that she betrayed you..

1721
02:31:08,860 --> 02:31:10,657
..before you died.

1722
02:31:11,195 --> 02:31:15,359
You can kill someone
but not break his heart.

1723
02:31:16,868 --> 02:31:18,392
Women, I tell you.

1724
02:31:20,238 --> 02:31:22,331
So my predictable good man.

1725
02:31:22,807 --> 02:31:24,707
Tell me where my gold is.

1726
02:31:28,312 --> 02:31:30,337
So he's the winner you chose?

1727
02:31:35,853 --> 02:31:37,684
Come on, Charlie. Tell me.

1728
02:31:38,756 --> 02:31:40,348
Tell me, Charlie.

1729
02:31:40,925 --> 02:31:42,483
I don't have all the time.

1730
02:31:44,929 --> 02:31:47,523
Tell me, Charlie, or
else I will shoot her.

1731
02:31:48,299 --> 02:31:50,665
You are wasting my time now, Charlie,
I will shoot her.

1732
02:31:50,768 --> 02:31:52,235
Wait.

1733
02:31:53,404 --> 02:31:54,598
I will tell you.

1734
02:32:09,587 --> 02:32:10,815
Riya.

1735
02:32:18,863 --> 02:32:20,421
Sorry, Charlie.

1736
02:32:21,632 --> 02:32:23,827
I didn't have a choice then.

1737
02:32:25,570 --> 02:32:26,867
But I do now.

1738
02:32:32,844 --> 02:32:33,970
Riya.

1739
02:32:43,688 --> 02:32:44,916
Bilal.

1740
02:34:06,971 --> 02:34:08,461
Hit him.

1741
02:34:08,539 --> 02:34:10,734
We still don't know where the gold is.

1742
02:34:37,602 --> 02:34:42,232
All my life I will regret
that I couldn't kill you.

1743
02:35:11,302 --> 02:35:16,535
Down came the rain drop
and washed the Spider out.

1744
02:36:14,365 --> 02:36:16,629
Chief, there's a call for you.

1745
02:36:16,901 --> 02:36:18,334
Okay.

1746
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:20,798
Hello.

1747
02:36:23,974 --> 02:36:25,441
Romanian gold?

1748
02:36:26,510 --> 02:36:27,943
Where in Wellington?

1749
02:36:28,779 --> 02:36:32,875
Where? Where?

1750
02:36:34,251 --> 02:36:35,343
Let's go.

1751
02:36:42,827 --> 02:36:44,556
Which are these three cars?

1752
02:36:44,662 --> 02:36:46,755
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1753
02:36:46,831 --> 02:36:49,891
I will tell you the
test of these three cars.

1754
02:36:59,977 --> 02:37:01,842
So now I understand.

1755
02:37:01,946 --> 02:37:04,244
You left the gold filled cars here.

1756
02:37:04,348 --> 02:37:05,940
And took these empty cars.

1757
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:07,740
Great, Charlie.

1758
02:37:07,852 --> 02:37:10,412
All thanks to M. C and his family.

1759
02:37:10,521 --> 02:37:12,386
You are Indians.

1760
02:37:12,456 --> 02:37:15,721
And I can even lay
down my life for Indians.

1761
02:37:16,327 --> 02:37:18,921
Go on, go on.

1762
02:37:19,663 --> 02:37:21,927
If they had waited a
little while longer..

1763
02:37:22,199 --> 02:37:23,962
..they could've taken
the veneration offerings.

1764
02:37:24,268 --> 02:37:27,431
My darling, they
have got their reward.

1765
02:37:27,538 --> 02:37:30,336
Now I will conduct the
veneration and give you your reward.

1766
02:37:30,441 --> 02:37:31,499
Come on.
- No, no.

1767
02:37:31,609 --> 02:37:33,372
Come on. Saying no to offerings.

1768
02:37:44,455 --> 02:37:45,717
Guys, Russian Mafia.

1769
02:37:46,257 --> 02:37:47,451
Everyone be cool.

1770
02:37:47,625 --> 02:37:49,490
No one will argue with them.

1771
02:37:53,864 --> 02:37:55,422
Check their cars.

1772
02:37:56,834 --> 02:37:59,325
But, sir, please..
- Shut up.

1773
02:37:59,436 --> 02:38:00,698
Understand.

1774
02:38:05,409 --> 02:38:06,501
Empty.

1775
02:38:06,677 --> 02:38:07,769
No gold.

1776
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:14,212
No gold.

1777
02:38:14,318 --> 02:38:15,615
It's not in this car either.

1778
02:38:15,719 --> 02:38:16,913
Then where is the gold?

1779
02:38:17,221 --> 02:38:18,313
Be quiet.

1780
02:38:29,834 --> 02:38:31,961
You look angry.

1781
02:38:32,269 --> 02:38:34,737
Look, don't lock horns with me today.

1782
02:38:34,839 --> 02:38:37,501
I have suffered a loss of 100 million.

1783
02:38:37,608 --> 02:38:39,701
I put my life at stake to get
the gold and what did I get?

1784
02:38:39,810 --> 02:38:40,936
Zilch.

1785
02:38:41,512 --> 02:38:43,412
What will I tell my
father when I return home?

1786
02:38:43,581 --> 02:38:44,809
You have the cars for your father.

1787
02:38:44,915 --> 02:38:46,906
What car?

1788
02:38:46,984 --> 02:38:48,417
Forget this.

1789
02:38:48,519 --> 02:38:51,420
Give him champagne.
- Yes, give me some poison.

1790
02:38:51,522 --> 02:38:53,717
Drink champagne and not poison.

1791
02:38:55,826 --> 02:38:57,851
At least spare this car.

1792
02:38:57,962 --> 02:38:59,725
That's the only memorabilia.

1793
02:39:10,841 --> 02:39:13,503
Oh my, it's made of gold.

1794
02:39:14,211 --> 02:39:15,303
And the rest of the cars?

1795
02:39:15,412 --> 02:39:16,436
What do you think?

1796
02:39:16,814 --> 02:39:21,547
Do you make cars only of
steel or iron.. - Brass, copper..

1797
02:39:21,652 --> 02:39:25,179
..fiber, thermocol, anything you want.

1798
02:39:25,956 --> 02:39:27,821
Gold.
- I..

1799
02:39:28,325 --> 02:39:30,589
Gold?
- Gold.

1800
02:39:32,463 --> 02:39:34,693
You mean the gold wasn't in the car..

1801
02:39:34,798 --> 02:39:36,561
..the car was made of gold itself.

1802
02:40:08,799 --> 02:40:11,666
Uncle, autograph please.

1803
02:40:13,704 --> 02:40:15,899
People will be stunned..

1804
02:40:16,206 --> 02:40:19,903
..when they see the
gold tires of my car.

1805
02:40:24,949 --> 02:40:27,281
Wow.
- Say it.

1806
02:40:27,785 --> 02:40:29,412
Open the gate, papa.

1807
02:41:20,838 --> 02:41:26,640
''Why is distance between us?''

1808
02:41:27,878 --> 02:41:34,181
''Let's come closer.''

1809
02:41:35,185 --> 02:41:41,351
''Feel it in every breath.''

1810
02:41:42,259 --> 02:41:49,324
''My intoxication.''

1811
02:41:50,267 --> 02:41:53,668
''Your charm always works.''

1812
02:41:53,771 --> 02:41:57,400
''Your beauty is alluring.''

1813
02:41:57,508 --> 02:42:00,807
''Your Beauty makes me sway.''

1814
02:42:00,911 --> 02:42:04,438
''I am enchanted by you.''

1815
02:42:04,548 --> 02:42:07,847
''Your intoxication is like a dream.''

1816
02:42:07,951 --> 02:42:11,443
''Your Beauty makes me sway.''

1817
02:42:11,555 --> 02:42:19,963
''You dwell in my thoughts,
my questions and my answers.''

1818
02:42:32,776 --> 02:42:39,272
''You are my desire.''

1819
02:42:40,584 --> 02:42:47,285
''You are my passion.''

1820
02:42:47,391 --> 02:42:53,762
''My life depends on you.''

1821
02:42:54,932 --> 02:43:00,962
''Always stay with me.''

1822
02:43:01,338 --> 02:43:04,774
''You have now become my habit.''

1823
02:43:04,842 --> 02:43:08,437
''Not just my habit, but I need you.''

1824
02:43:08,545 --> 02:43:18,443
''I take you in my and sway.''

1825
02:43:19,305 --> 02:43:25,517
