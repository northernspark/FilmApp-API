The eland, David, has a long nose
and it has four legs.

Why does it have to be so early?

117
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,392
It is the best time to view the animals.

118
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:20,853
Once the sun's up,
it's gonna just get way too hot.

125
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,949
Give Dad a hug. All right!

126
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:43,926
Watch your head.

127
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,062
Okay, now, the two of you...

128
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:50,104
try against all your natural instincts
to have a nice time.

129
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:53,789
Okay? Don't bug your sister.

No? Okay.

132
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,200
Guys, take a look. That over there-
that's the Crocodile River.

133
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:28,761
[ Amy ]
It's not much of a river, is it?

134
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,649
You should see it after the first summer rains.
It's teeming with wildlife.

135
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,951
- Are there crocodiles?
- Sure.

136
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:42,234
Are we actually gonna see some animals,
or are you just gonna talk about 'em all day?

137
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:44,215
Well, how about we do
some off-roading then?

138
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,152
- I thought we were off-roading.
- No, I mean off off-roading.

Hold on, guys.

00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:05,185
- Um, Mr. Ranger?
- Yeah, buddy?

141
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,284
- I gotta go.
- Go where?

142
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:10,242
Go.

143
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,346
[ Chuckles ]
All right. Hold on.

144

[ Quiet Growl ]

145
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:30,424
So you said you've gotta go?
[ Chuckles ]

146
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,506
- There it is.
- Oh, no way.

147
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,579
- What's the matter? Take it.
- No, thanks.

148
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:39,033
- Why?
- I don't need to pee.

149
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,017
- Come on then. Let's go.
- Whoa.

150
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,480
Brian, do you think
this is a good idea?

151
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:46,719
- With him like this, I think it's a very good idea.
- I mean for safety reasons.

152
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:50,846
I've got the rifle. He'll be fine,
and so will you two. We'll see you now.
