Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,253
He was offensive.

3
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,695
He was obnoxious.

4
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,699
He was disgusting.

5
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,565
Do you want me to go on?

6
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,206
Once he wanted me
to approve a contest

7
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,242
where he would
give a new toilet

8
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,836
to the listener with
the largest bowel movement.

9
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,841
On the air.

10
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,317
I mean, you can imagine
the logistics of that.

11
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:11,167
You know, when I look back
on this moment in my life,

12
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,205
I really wanted it to work.

13
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,741
I wanted this to be
the biggest moment

14
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,242
in the history of entertainment.
I'm not kidding.

15
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,871
I wanted everyone
to wake up the next morning

16
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,177
talking about me,
Howard Stern.

17
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,843
That's the kind
of thinking, though,

18
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,410
that usually
gets me into trouble.

19
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,854
I'm here to introduce
the next presenter.

20
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,052
Believe me, a lot of people
refused to introduce this guy,

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,058
but, uh...

22
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,185
Is this safe?

23
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,060
When you drop,
don't spin around

24
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,326
or the wires
get screwed up.

25
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,461
...Radio waves
high above America...

26
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,705
It's a bird...

27
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,605
I'm making such a mistake.

28
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,143
It's a plane...

29
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,011
No, it's Fartman!

30
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,011
Behold, I am Fartman.

31
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,816
Behold, the greatest.
That is me.

32
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,154
The mightiest
of superheroes.

33
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,922
My ass has power!

34
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,462
Screw Superman.

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,761
I am Fartman.
Fartman rules.

36
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,267
Fartman.

37
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,803
Fartman!

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,841
And now, in an extraordinary
display of my powers,

39
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,542
I will show you
something so marvelous.

40
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,549
Behold.

41
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:43,020
The lovely
and talented Fartman,
ladies and gentlemen.

42
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,604
I got to tell you,
with all this carrying on,

43
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,073
I mean, the way
they were screaming,

44
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,007
at first I really thought
I'd won them over.

45
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,841
I thought I was the Beatles
on Ed Sullivan or something.

46
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,404
Oh, shock...

47
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,813
But did my fellow artists
appreciate

48
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,149
the comedically ironic aspect
of my new superhero character?

49
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,052
No. They just thought
I was an idiot.

50
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,491
You know, most of these people
are Satan-worshipping junkies.

51
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,233
Hey, look, all I want
is for my artistic courage

52
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,768
to be an inspiration
to others.

53
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:23,802
Instead, I'm a joke.

54
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,963
Excuse me.
I didn't mean
to interrupt.

55
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,807
Embarrassing.

56
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,108
See, that's when I came
to a profound realization...

57
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,241
Everything I do
is misunderstood.

58
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,250
Haah!

59
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,344
Everything I do
is misunderstood.

60
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,389
I mean, think about
what a burden that is.

61
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,787
What a thing
to go through life with.

62
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,689
All I'm trying to do
is be funny,

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,957
and I end up
feeling like an asshole.

64
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,362
What a fucking jerk.

65
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,201
Howard, it was a home run.

66
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,365
You think so?

67
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,841
Absolutely.
And when you said,

68
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,470
"All of Hollywood
can kiss my ass,"

69
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,380
you had every
teenager in the country
eating out of your hand.

70
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,544
My guess is
we'll get coverage
from 200, maybe 300...

71
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,199
Howard.

72
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,869
Howard...
here's your ticket.

73
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,873
OK? Now call me as soon as
you get to New York, will you?

74
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,841
Yo, Fartman.
Love you, man.

75
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,501
Thanks.

76
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,706
All right. So getting back
to what I was talking about...

77
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,581
More than anything, I'd like
the public to appreciate me.

78
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,985
No, forget that.
I want them to love me...

79
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,522
Not the myth, but the man.

80
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,387
The real Howard.

81
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,426
Let me demonstrate my point.

82
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,426
Thank you.

83
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,962
Now, take this woman,
for example.

84
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,530
She hates me.

85
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,226
She doesn't even know me,

86
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,668
but it's clear that she's
totally disgusted by me.

87
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,068
Down the aisle
on your right.

88
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,401
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

89
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,804
You don't possibly have
another seat available for me?

90
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,672
I'm sorry.
We're showing a full load.

91
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,267
Right here on your left.

92
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,643
Full load.

93
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,582
Yes.
Sir, may I help you?

94
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,084
To your right.

95
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,086
Hello.

96
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,087
Hello.

97
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,124
Is this yours?

98
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,715
Yeah. If you want
to read it, you can.

99
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,260
Thank you.

100
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,363
Pfft, I've seen
this look before,

101
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,099
believe me.

102
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,664
It's the look
of misunderstanding.

103
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,936
She thinks I'm a moron.

104
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,878
In fact, all my life,
people have told me I was a moron.

105
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,016
You're a moron.
Now shut up and sit still.

106
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,415
You're a moron.
Now shut up and sit still.

107
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,954
So this is my dad Ben Stern.

108
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,150
He was an engineer
at a radio station in Manhattan... WHOM.

109
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,989
Why do we live in Roosevelt
when you work in New York?

110
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,119
Shut up.

111
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,130
We never played catch
or went to ball games.

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,963
The only sport
my father liked was yelling.

113
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:09,967
Nothing but crap.

114
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,332
- Is this one crap?
- Don't be a moron.

115
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,502
# Shut up your mouth,
That is your daddy #

116
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,602
# Oh, no #

117
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,307
# My daddy
can't be ugly so #

118
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,475
# Shut your mouth,
go away #

119
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,916
# Ooh, Mama
look-a boo boo day #

120
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:27,918
Huh!

121
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:28,919
# Shut your mouth... #

122
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,512
My father
commuted every day,

123
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,591
I guess it was, about 40 miles
into Manhattan.

124
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,422
He'd leave at 7:00 in the morning,
get home around midnight or something.

125
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,427
I mean, I never saw the guy.

126
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,463
Come on. Come on.

127
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,896
Once a year, my old man
would break down

128
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,158
and take me
to work with him.

129
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,462
A little quality time.

130
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,230
I liked that.
A little bonding.

131
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,271
Dad and son together.

132
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,805
I looked forward to that.

133
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,142
Take my hand,
Howard.

134
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,643
And remember, Howard,

135
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,680
I work here,
so keep your mouth shut.

136
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,214
# Never know
how much I love you... #

137
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,647
You spin and you spin
and you spin.

138
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,652
Records...
Who gives a damn?

139
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,653
Daddy.

140
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:03,916
I told you, shut up.

141
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,049
That man's
throwing records.

142
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,024
No, nobody gives
a goddamn about it.

143
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,925
None of it.
What the fuck is it?

144
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,794
Just fucking records!
It's just this fucking place.

145
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,332
None of it means anything.
It's empty...

146
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,630
Sid, you're on
in 15 seconds.

147
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,033
Get a grip on yourself!

148
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,401
Ah, what the hell
do you know, you bastard?

149
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,733
You mieskait!

150
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,640
You're gonna play the music
for the people? It doesn't...

151
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,641
Symphony Sid!

152
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,008
By the powers vested in me

153
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,047
by the Federal
Communications Commission,

154
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,410
I command you

155
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:33,610
to get on the microphone
in a serious manner

156
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,677
and continue this broadcast.

157
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,430
This is
Sunday Blues And Jazz,

158
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,027
and I'm your host
Symphony Sid.

159
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,268
And now... something
for a blue Sunday.

160
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,641
From that moment on,
I wanted to be on the radio.

161
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,078
Show business
was definitely for me.

162
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:08,353
And for my 12th birthday,
my mother bought me
some puppets,

163
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,050
and pretty soon,
I was spreading joy
throughout the community.

164
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,183
# Biddi-bim-bom,
ay-yi-yi #

165
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,317
# Biddi-biddi-biddi #

166
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,759
# Biddi-biddi-biddi-biddi #

167
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,194
# Biddi-biddi-biddi... #

168
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,358
Oh, baby, I want it. Give it to me.

169
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:22,957
More. More. Ohh!

170
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,036
You like that, huh?

171
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,367
Oh, yes, I love it, baby.
Give it to me.

172
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,135
Oh, baby, yes!
Right there. Ohh!

173
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,073
Oh, more! Harder!

174
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,167
You want it harder?

175
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,576
Oh, yes, harder.
Please give it to me, please.

176
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,410
Ohh! Aah! Aah!

177
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,917
But why can't I play
with my puppets?

178
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,352
Shut up! You know why.

179
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,218
Ah...

180
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,828
You know,
life is very strange.

181
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,693
# Pretend you're happy... #

182
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,664
Just about the time
my puppet career ended,

183
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,702
my whole neighborhood
underwent a demographic shift.

184
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,101
My parents said we're moving
because of those niggers.

185
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,867
They said pretty soon, Roosevelt's
going to be nothing but niggers.

186
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,738
Really? My parents
said we're moving

187
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,935
because of
all the Shvartzes.

188
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,876
Shvartzes are niggers,
idiot.

189
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:07,935
They're the same thing.

190
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,550
I don't want to hear any more
of this, you hear me?

191
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm half negro,
and Howard's half negro.

192
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,248
And anything bad
you say about negroes,

193
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,847
you're saying about us,
you understand?

194
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:24,089
# And nothing's bad
as it may seem... #

195
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,597
Mom, we're half negro?

196
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,471
I can't believe
the stories he makes up.

197
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,940
I mean, I never made him
wear my underwear to school.

198
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,842
And... And as far as my taking
his rectal temperature

199
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,675
every day till he was 14...

200
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,011
He shouldn't make
such a big deal.

201
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,745
He still grew up to be
a very well-adjusted individual.

202
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:47,808
Absolutely.

203
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,548
# Papa was
a rolling stone... #

204
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,124
Roosevelt High School...
beautiful.

205
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,786
A fully integrated
educational institution,

206
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,762
which of course meant
6,000 black guys and me.

207
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,264
And then I hit puberty.

208
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,561
That made things worse

209
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,568
because my penis
never got any bigger.

210
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,297
I mean, I was hung
like a 3-year-old.

211
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,307
Hey, seriously, these guys had
rhinoceros penises... huge.

212
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,037
You know, I've heard
black men complain

213
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,442
that they're
unfairly stereotyped.

214
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,970
Man, I'd love to have
a stereotype like that.

215
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,018
Now, because I had
such a minuscule schlonger,

216
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,383
I turned to drugs.

217
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,890
Unfortunately, the drugs
really made me paranoid.

218
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,330
Howard, I smell smoke.
Are you smoking in there?

219
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,128
There's no smoke
in here.

220
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,193
Howard, your father wants to
see you downstairs.

221
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,205
Howard.

222
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,441
Howard, you're graduating
from high school this year.

223
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,746
You should be making some kind
of plan for your future.

224
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,785
You need a plan.

225
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,411
I want to be on the radio.

226
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,456
He wants to be on radio.

227
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,685
But to be on the radio,
you have to have a voice.

228
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,421
You have to have
some verbal ability.

229
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,520
You hardly ever say a word.

230
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,498
This all from a guy who's only told me
to shut up about 50,000 times.

231
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,966
I talk.

232
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,870
You really want to be
on the radio?

233
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,974
OK. If you want
a shot at radio,

234
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,503
the counseling center says
there's a communications program

235
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,809
at Boston University.

236
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,226
OK, I know
what you're saying.

237
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,025
You're saying I look
a little old to be in college.

238
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,124
Well, for this movie,
you gotta suspend disbelief.

239
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,031
Hey, Lisa.

240
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,503
Lisa.
Hi, how you doing?

241
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,766
Hi.

242
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,468
I was wondering if you'd
like to go out Friday night.

243
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,669
With you?

244
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,404
No, thanks.

245
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,415
Hi. I was just
wondering if you...

246
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,917
Uh, no.

247
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,390
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

248
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,427
Excuse me.

249
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,427
Would you like to
go out Friday night?

250
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,929
Friday?

251
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,299
No. I have a lot of reading
to catch up on,

252
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,806
but thank you.

253
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,311
So I masturbated a lot...
2-time-a-day habit.

254
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,380
I'm not proud of it,
but I did it.

255
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,278
Senior year...
Big year for me.

256
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,373
I finally
got up the courage

257
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,042
to go down
to the college radio station

258
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,312
and get myself on the air.

259
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,320
And my name
is Howard Stern

260
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,413
on the Howard Stern
Experience,

261
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,961
and if you love music,
you'll love Deep Purple on TBU.

262
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,874
Ohh!

263
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,467
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

264
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,806
Ooh!

265
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,815
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

266
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,577
How do I forget it?

267
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,052
It's the single worst moment
in radio history.

268
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,350
It's not radio.

269
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,391
It's college radio.

270
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,686
There's
nobody listening.

271
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,194
Nobody. Maybe, like,
3 guys in a dorm somewhere.

272
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,924
Oh, shit.

273
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,022
Oh, fuck.

274
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,997
I know someone on this block.
Let me think.

275
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,904
Come on.
We're getting wet.

276
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:25,935
Down here. Down here.
Down here.

277
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,639
Hi, Elyse.

278
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,003
Hey.

279
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,304
So, we were on our way to a rally
in support of feminism,

280
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,901
and we got caught
in the rain.

281
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,242
I'm wondering if we can come in
and just hang out for awhile.

282
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,111
Sure,
come on in.

283
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,276
Can I use
your hair dryer?

284
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,980
Yeah, there's one at the end
of the hall. Hey, Rach.

285
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,215
Hi, Ellen.
This is Howard.

286
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,780
Oh, hi.
My hair's wet.

287
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:46,790
Put that there.

288
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,554
I'm just going to go
dry my hair.

289
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,618
Hey, I heard you
on the radio today.

290
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:51,788
You heard that?

291
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,229
Yeah. What happened?

292
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,324
I didn't think anybody
even listened to that.

293
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,959
Alison, this is Howard.
Howard, this is Alison.

294
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:57,968
Alison's
one of my roommates.

295
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:58,969
Hey.

296
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,079
Howard.

297
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,080
Howard.

298
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,709
Hair dryer's
in the bathroom.

299
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,014
Hi. Hi.

300
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,353
Hi, I'm Howard.

301
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,654
Look at you, man.

302
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,422
You can get her.
You can get her.

303
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,894
She looks hot.

304
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,365
How are you?

305
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,231
I'm making a film
for my film class,

306
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,701
and, I mean,
it's a legitimate film.

307
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,704
You won't... You're not gonna
be naked or anything.

308
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:34,966
You'll have your clothes on,
you know.

309
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,268
What's it about?

310
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,037
Well, I'm glad
you asked me that.

311
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,410
In my, um, psychology class,
we're studying B.F. Skinner,

312
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:46,918
and I started to realize that
what Skinner says is true...

313
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,079
We're all rats
trapped in a box,

314
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,621
all searching
for a piece of cheese.

315
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,452
Mm-hmm.

316
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,957
And I'm going to shoot it
on Saturday.

317
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,018
I mean, I can't do it
Saturday.

318
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,259
I work with an outpatient program
for schizophrenics.

319
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,799
One of them actually
killed himself,

320
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,198
so I'm taking
the whole group to...

321
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,396
to the funeral
on Saturday, but...

322
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,870
Sorry.

323
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,601
You are really perfect.

324
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,270
L... All right.
What if I reschedule?

325
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,472
Beautiful. Beautiful.
I don't believe it.

326
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,380
Look, I refused
to leave the room

327
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,816
until she agreed
to be in my film.

328
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,217
I feel stupid.

329
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,586
Seriously, she was the most
enchanting woman I'd ever met.

330
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,818
I'm telling you, I am looking
for the face of an angel.

331
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:27,824
You have
the face of an angel.

332
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,093
Save me.

333
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,425
Save me.

334
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,630
He comes to me.

335
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,435
He comes to me.

336
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,375
Ahh...

337
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,435
Save me.

338
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,616
We give the award
for best student film

339
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,852
to... Mr. Howard Stern.

340
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,328
I'll tell you,
nothing makes a woman hotter

341
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,162
than to be with
an award-winning filmmaker.

342
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,258
This I know.

343
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,099
And at this point,
I knew I was gonna score.

344
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,536
I mean,
it was fait accompli.

345
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,436
I was in. This was it.

346
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:18,499
I'm a stud.
She was liquefied.

347
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,374
We did not have sex
on our first date,

348
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,778
although
he was very sexual.

349
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,078
Our sex life
has always been good.

350
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,381
I mean, Howard complains
that his penis is too small,

351
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,945
but his penis size is fine.

352
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,957
Howard exaggerates.

353
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,261
- OK.
- Now hold this and say...

354
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,762
Hi.
Hi, I'm Camille,

355
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,425
and, uh, I'm in Westchester,
New York, and...

356
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,161
This is Howard's
first job interview.

357
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,601
And this is Howard's
first job interview.

358
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,162
Well, he's going to his first
job interview in New York.

359
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,172
All right...

360
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,173
- One more thing.
- Yes?

361
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,174
Can you
take your top off?

362
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,540
- No.
- No, I'm serious.

363
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,306
I'm serious. That's what
they want you to do.

364
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,109
- No, they do not.
- Yeah, they do.

365
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,148
- No way.
- No, they do.

366
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,410
Howard did not
tell me...

367
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,762
I'm Moti,
station manager.

368
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,162
- Howard Stern.
- You want to be a disc jockey?

369
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,064
Very much so.
I've wanted to be a disc jockey

370
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,067
since I was
7 years old.

371
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,899
What are you,
an idiot?

372
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,201
No, sir,
I'm not an idiot.

373
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,333
L... ln fact, I have a communications
degree from Boston University,

374
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,105
and I would work very hard
for this company

375
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,110
if given
the opportunity to...

376
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,111
You wanted
to see me?

377
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,841
You came late yesterday.

378
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,179
You came late today.
I don't need you. You're fired.

379
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,980
Fuck you.

380
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,179
Good. Fuck you.

381
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,518
You punk!
Fuck you 1,000%% %!

382
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,851
Fuck you
till your asshole

383
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,551
is perfect
donkey asshole!

384
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,352
OK,
you start tomorrow.

385
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,263
10 a.m. To 2 p. M, eh?

386
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,492
Yes.

387
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,535
Pay $96 a week and don't
bring me your problems.

388
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,534
OK.

389
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,797
I'm not psychiatrist.

390
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,862
Thank you very much.

391
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,431
I promise you
I will not disappoint you.

392
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,136
Thank you.

393
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,644
And I start
tomorrow?

394
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,409
Westchester 107,
WRNW 107.

395
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,317
Hi, this is Howard Stern,
and it's 75 degrees presently,

396
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,218
winds out of the northwest.

397
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,952
Chance of precipitation,
85%% % for tonight.

398
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,493
Looks like rain.

399
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:20,157
Tomorrow, partly sunny
at WRNW, Westchester 107.

400
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,933
I was sort of living
with Alison

401
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,531
while she worked on her Master's
of social work, which was really great.

402
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,508
I was also still living
with my parents...

403
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,509
Howard?

404
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,510
Which wasn't so great.

405
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,910
Yeah. Yeah, ma?

406
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,414
I smell smoke.
Are you smoking in there?

407
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,350
No, Ma.
There's no smoke in here.

408
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,217
107 FM, WRNW.

409
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,483
I'm Howard Stern
with you each and every day,

410
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,787
and I've got a great
two for Tuesday.

411
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,762
107 FM... The Ramones...
Gabba gabba wee,

412
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,797
Gabba gabba hey,

413
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,333
Gabba gabba gabba gabba...

414
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,668
Howard, you stink.

415
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,738
I don't mince words.
You will never be a great disc jockey.

416
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,842
You have lousy voice, lousy personality,
and this will not change.

417
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,649
OK? So on the air
is not for you.

418
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,852
But you come on time,
and you are good worker, huh?

419
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,450
So...

420
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,361
how about I make you...

421
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,556
program director?

422
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,368
Program director?

423
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,734
Program... director.

424
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,898
You. You.

425
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,306
You run station.

426
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,810
You... sit.

427
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,743
You pick music.

428
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,804
No more $96 a week.

429
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,645
Eh. I pay you...

430
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,207
you, eh?

431
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,414
$250 a week.

432
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,294
You be management...
like me.

433
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,328
To be quite honest, I didn't really
want to be a programmer.

434
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,865
But at $250 a week,
I could marry Alison,

435
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,525
and we'd get
a real place together.

436
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,627
Oh, look at her.
I mean, this was a miracle.

437
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,831
Here's this beautiful girl,

438
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,134
I mean, a gorgeous woman,

439
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,607
willing to spend
the rest of her life with me.

440
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,338
I just couldn't
have been happier.

441
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,075
I was the happiest
program director in the world.

442
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,014
Yeah, me.
Program director.

443
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:20,881
Overnight,
I become the big boss.

444
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,251
Howard Stern,
executive manager.

445
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,381
I had no idea
what I was doing,

446
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,823
no clue what to do
with this job whatsoever,

447
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,361
but I did it, and everyone
bought into it.

448
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,023
They thought I knew what I was doing.
This was great.

449
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,030
Howard.

450
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,066
Oh, hey, Moti.

451
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,601
Advertising is up.
Profit is up.

452
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,897
Oh, great.

453
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,599
As a disc jockey, you're...
you're shit... ha ha ha ha...

454
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,141
But you are a great programmer.
Here, payday.

455
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,176
Thanks, Moti.

456
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,078
Listen, I want you
to fire Dickie Davis.

457
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,079
But why?

458
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,672
None of your business.

459
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,910
The guy's got 3 kids.

460
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,510
You want to be management,
you fire him, huh?

461
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,646
It's good to fire someone. It gives
a good message to the others.

462
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,156
Just fire him, huh?

463
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,818
I don't want to fire him.
You fire him.

464
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,825
Howard...

465
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,919
disc jockeys are dogs.

466
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,227
Your job is to make them
fetch, eh?

467
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,095
Now, if you want
to truly be management,

468
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,828
you be a man
and fire him.

469
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,530
Do it. Be a man.

470
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,982
Tell Dickie Davis
Howard wants to see him now.

471
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,758
How? Howard?

472
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:37,760
Don't look.

473
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:38,989
You OK?

474
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,962
Let me ask you something.
Would you still love me...

475
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,628
if I gave up
my programming job,

476
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,002
and I stayed on the air,
and I made a lot less money?

477
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,201
Yes. I mean, you know,
I'd have to leave you,

478
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,938
but I'd still love you.

479
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,570
Be serious.

480
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,344
If I make less money, we wouldn't
even be able to afford this apartment.

481
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,943
Well, we can't really
afford the apartment now,

482
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,851
so it doesn't quite matter,
really.

483
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,446
I guess.

484
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,594
Do what you need to do.

485
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,125
Come on back here,
hold this sign...

486
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,190
right in front of you.
Come on back.

487
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,634
I want you to say
"Howard goes to Hartford

488
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,605
and becomes the wacky
morning man at WCCC."

489
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,369
Howard goes to Hartford at CCC.

490
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,810
"Howard goes to Hartford and becomes
the wacky morning man at WCCC."

491
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,313
Howard goes to Hartford
at W...

492
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,508
All right, all right,
that's not going to work.

493
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,519
Howard comes to Hartford
to become the wacky morning man

494
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,918
at WCCC.

495
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,853
Let's see
some muscles.

496
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,950
How about
some back muscles?

497
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,461
Was my voice too deep
doing that?

498
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,461
No. It's very feminine.

499
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:59,334
WCCC, FM 107 and AM 1290.

500
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,503
My name is Fred Norris,
and, uh...

501
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,741
stick around for
the new guy Howard Stern

502
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,749
And the Howard Stern
program.

503
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,711
Hi.

504
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,585
Oh. Oh, my God.

505
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,886
Oh, it's so...

506
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,085
Hi,
I'm Howard Stern.

507
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,821
How you doing?
You're Fred.

508
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,863
I can't believe
how late I am.

509
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,227
Who would've thought?

510
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,823
I'm on the Berlin turnpike,
and I take a left-hand turn,

511
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,132
and I've rehearsed this 500 times,
getting here, and I somehow got lost.

512
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,171
Ohh.

513
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,907
I'm sweating.

514
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm so hot.

515
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,874
I'm so tahitzed.

516
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,970
[Sighs] I'm hot.

517
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,918
I was planning
on being on time.

518
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,288
Whoo, man.

519
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,087
Whoo-oo-oo...

520
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,620
107 FM, AM 1290, WCCC.
Good morning.

521
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,325
My name is Howard Stern.
I'm the new morning man on CCC.

522
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,994
Sitting with me,
uh, Mr. Ringo...

523
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,766
Mr. Ringo Starr,
and he's here in the studio.

524
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,807
Hi, Ringo.

525
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,364
How you doin', me love?

526
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,308
I wish you'd play us a little
Wipeout this morning,

527
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,504
Wake everybody up.

528
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,511
Oh, yeah,
that was great, Ringo.

529
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,781
CCC, AM 1290, FM 107.

530
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,288
This is Cheap Trick.

531
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,488
Ohh. Thank you.

532
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,723
Whoa.

533
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,027
Hartford ended up
being OK, you know.

534
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,623
I mean, Fred seemed
to really like me.

535
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,191
I mean, I think
he really liked me.

536
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,964
The guy's like wallpaper.
Who can get a read on him?

537
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,767
And Alison, well,
she got a job right away.

538
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,775
Now, if you wanted
to buy liver for dinner,

539
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,276
what would you do?

540
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,437
Go to the...
supermarket?

541
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,037
That's right.
And then what?

542
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,844
This afternoon...
Gray skies,

543
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,852
occasional showers,
and precipitation.

544
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,911
Highs near 75.

545
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,184
It's going to be
raining like cats...

546
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,960
And chickens,
I don't think so.

547
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,425
And dogs.

548
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,125
WCCC also wants
to remind you

549
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,962
that our new sponsor
Stanley Sport,

550
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,094
um, is a great place
to go.

551
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,105
You know, I got to tell you something.
When I was a child,

552
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,266
I used to go to Stanley Sport
all the time.

553
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,832
I loved Stanley Sport.

554
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,470
My parents would take me through there,
and we just had a great time.

555
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,137
And we could walk out
with tons of stuff

556
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,409
even though my parents
didn't make a lot of money.

557
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,075
Oh.

558
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,779
And, uh, "There's only
one Stanley Sports,

559
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,152
"and the grand opening
is this weekend.

560
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:27,316
Mark it on your calendar."

561
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,454
The grand opening
is this...

562
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,498
I just realized, uh... that makes
no sense what I just said.

563
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,897
I just told you I went there as a kid,
and now the grand opening...

564
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,494
Well, I just...
I think I was just caught in a lie.

565
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,936
Oh, boy. You know
what the truth is?

566
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,601
I'm a disc jockey
who makes $250 a week,

567
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,837
and I just want to do
the right thing here on the air.

568
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,881
I don't want to get fired,
so, uh, I guess I lied to you,

569
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,076
but, uh, I'll never let that
happen again. You know what I mean?

570
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,743
Oh, boy, do I feel stupid.

571
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,916
Seriously, I heard
the show today.

572
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,651
I think you're
really getting good.

573
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,192
What part did you
like in particular?

574
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,058
Was it the Chinese guy calling in
for the Doobie Brothers tickets?

575
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,725
You know when you did that ad,
when you were just being yourself?

576
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,131
That's what
you liked?

577
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,828
Yeah.

578
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,302
Really?

579
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,202
It was funny.

580
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,901
# Gonna use my arms,
gonna use my legs... #

581
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,239
Little by little,

582
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,540
our ratings
actually improved,

583
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,546
and before long,
I got to interview

584
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,047
my first real
semifamous celebrity,

585
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,380
"B" movie star
Brittany Fairchild.

586
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,714
While I'm
interviewing her,

587
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,049
she actually invites me

588
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,089
to go to a premiere
for her movie.

589
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:33,624
I remember
how embarrassing it was

590
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,387
because nobody
knew who I was.

591
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,654
I'm escorting
this woman around,

592
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,491
and none of these people
know who I am.

593
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,157
They just think she has
some ugly boyfriend, you know?

594
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,564
But who cared?
I mean, it was exciting.

595
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,047
Hello?

596
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,719
I'm here for the shoot.

597
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,759
Is anybody there?

598
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,039
Hello?

599
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,873
Ohh.

600
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,007
My back hurts.

601
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,346
Would you mind taking me
back to my hotel room?

602
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,220
I know this director,

603
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,016
and he told me that
when he was little,

604
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,023
his mother
killed his sister,

605
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,820
but was never charged.

606
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:42,825
Wow.

607
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,953
Come in.

608
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,531
Come in.

609
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,700
- It's nice.
- Sit down.

610
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,535
I'll be right back.

611
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,669
OK.

612
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,717
Hey, man.

613
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,017
Free drinks.

614
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,420
Ahem.

615
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,565
What the hell
is she doing?

616
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,702
I think she's
running a bath.

617
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,241
Oh, my God, man,
she's taking her clothes off.

618
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,509
I guess she forgot
to close the door.

619
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,948
Well, she's
a Hollywood actress.

620
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,383
They have a lot
on their mind.

621
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:45,181
Oh, my God.

622
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,055
Oh, is she cute.

623
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,285
Howard?

624
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,352
Yes?

625
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,331
Could you come here
for a second?

626
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,478
Oh. Hi.

627
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,177
My shoulders tense up
when I travel.

628
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,015
Would you mind
rubbing them for a minute?

629
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,884
Works best when
I'm in a hot bath.

630
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,753
It helps
relax the muscles.

631
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,191
I don't know
if that's OK or not.

632
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,526
Please.
It really hurts.

633
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,864
Look, I don't know
that I can do this.

634
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,562
I'll tell you what,
I'll just kneel over here,

635
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,537
and I'll rub your shoulders
from back here.

636
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,166
No. Sit behind me
in the tub.

637
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,539
Oh, I can't do that.

638
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,373
Why not?

639
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,243
Well, for one thing,
my clothes are gonna get all wet.

640
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:47,011
Well, then I guess
you better take them off.

641
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:50,020
I got to tell you something.
You are gorgeous,

642
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,612
And... And you're a great actress
and everything,

643
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,157
but I got a wife at home.
I can't cheat on my wife.

644
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,386
Then leave
your underwear on.

645
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,452
What?

646
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,795
If you leave your underwear on,
then you can't cheat.

647
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,527
It's just like
going swimming.

648
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,034
I don't know
what it was,

649
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,663
but she started
making a lot of sense.

650
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,001
I really
need your help.

651
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,837
My back
really hurts.

652
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,969
She's right.

653
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,678
Could you start
with my shoulders?

654
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,678
Ahh...

655
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,052
yeah.

656
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:27,483
Mmm.

657
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,426
Can you come around
my sides?

658
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,827
I think I pulled a muscle
in my rib cage.

659
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,433
Mmm.

660
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,831
Howard...

661
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,305
I know how to give
a man pleasure.

662
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:50,980
Mmm.

663
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,873
Ooh. Oh.

664
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,681
Pleasure.

665
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,847
Oh. Oh, wow.

666
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,256
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

667
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,794
Stop that. Stop.

668
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,352
Oh, whoa.

669
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,397
Oh, man.

670
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,557
Wow. Thank you.
Oh, my.

671
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,464
Thanks. Thanks...
Thanks for everything.

672
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,797
Listen, the premiere
and everything.

673
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,030
Oh, my God.

674
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,129
I just...
I just got to go.

675
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,367
You know, it was a great
interview on the radio.

676
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,103
Thanks... Thanks...
Thank you.

677
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,405
I really got to go.

678
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,877
Good-bye!

679
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,036
# I'll take you there #

680
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,083
# Oh, oh #

681
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,276
# Oh! #

682
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,377
# I'll take you there #

683
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,488
# Oh! Oh! Oh! #

684
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,149
# I'll take you there #

685
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,753
# Mercy now #

686
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:37,954
# I'll take you there #

687
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,394
# I'm callin',
callin' #

688
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,728
# Callin'
for mercy #

689
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,824
# I'll take you there #

690
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,733
# Mercy, mercy #

691
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:48,996
Hi.

692
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,506
Hey. How was it?

693
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,065
So bad. So horrible.

694
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,838
I just had
the worst night of my life.

695
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,437
I mean, I can't even begin
to tell you how miserable I am.

696
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,141
It is so late.
I got to get to bed.

697
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,706
I mean, no one
realizes I got to be up

698
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,274
at 4:00 in the morning
in that radio station.

699
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,683
I can't believe
how late it is.

700
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,153
- Go up and get in...
- OK.

701
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,348
L... I just...

702
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,983
I just need to rest.
I need to get some sleep.

703
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,321
Horrible.

704
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,155
God, let me
get away with this,

705
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:18,430
and I swear I'll never stray
from Alison again. Never.

706
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,095
I just want
to thank someone this morning.

707
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,570
I want to thank
Brittany Fairchild

708
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,901
For having myself
and Fred

709
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,965
out to, uh, her new movie.
It was really good.

710
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,943
Fred, what'd you think
of the movie?

711
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,501
I was very moved.

712
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,410
I think a lot of us
were moved last night.

713
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:33,314
CCC, AM 1290, FM 107...

714
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,208
It's the fifth-largest market
in the United States,

715
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,745
and they want me
to start tomorrow,

716
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,303
which is a good sign,
I think.

717
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,780
That means they're,
you know,

718
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,283
they're really desperate
for me, which I like.

719
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:11,083
And they say they're gonna move the
building to the best part of the city,

720
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,056
which I think is good, too...
You know, pump money into the facility.

721
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,786
And the station manager
says we are gonna be

722
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,124
the most aggressive
radio station in Detroit.

723
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,892
We are gonna dominate
the marketplace, which I lo...

724
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,067
Are these yours?

725
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,209
They're wet.

726
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:42,352
Alison's not
coming to Detroit.

727
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,650
I should have
just come home

728
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,690
and told my wife everything,
admitted the truth,

729
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,749
'cause now my wife
doesn't even trust me anymore,

730
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,817
and I don't blame her because
I don't trust me, either.

731
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:54,456
I'm a stupid idiot.
I'm so stupid!

732
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,124
What am I gonna do?

733
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,102
I don't know.

734
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,004
I can always
count on you for help, man.

735
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,472
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

736
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,512
Listen, man, as soon as I get
to Detroit and things start happenin',

737
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,074
I'm gonna get these guys
to hire you, all right?

738
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,381
OK.

739
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,355
Fred, I'm serious.
I'm not gonna forget ya.

740
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,652
Bye.

741
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,405
# Cat scratch fever... #

742
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,965
Howard.
How you doing, man?

743
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,237
How you doing, Marvin?

744
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,040
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

745
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,581
Hey, Patricia Fonfara,
meet Howard Stern. Your newslady.

746
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,810
Hi. I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

747
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,351
The Duke of rock's
just finishing up,

748
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,410
and then we're gonna
get right inside, so...

749
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,388
Hey, Marvin, what happened
to the new building?

750
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,924
I told you, we're gonna
build a new building.

751
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,357
First we got to build
an audience. Heh.

752
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,897
Hey, the Duke of rock's
gettin' ready to walk,

753
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,593
but I want you
to stick around,

754
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:07,069
because we got
a brand-new morning man...

755
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,572
looks like Big Bird
to me...

756
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,130
coming next

757
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,736
on W4106 FM.

758
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,473
What's happening, man?

759
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,980
Come on in, Big Bird.

760
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:20,074
How you doing, man?
Good to see ya.

761
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:23,051
How's things? What's that?
You're gonna do what?

762
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,055
Is that ri... Well, now,
how about that, kiddies?

763
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,921
He's gonna have Kermit the Frog
come in here and sing the Alphabet Song,

764
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:28,924
isn't that somethin'?

765
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,654
Coming up next
on the Big Bird show.

766
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,355
I got to go. See you
at midnight tonight.

767
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,692
This is the Duke of rock
saying,

768
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,459
If you can't be good,
be bad, baby.

769
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,659
Bye.

770
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,032
Hi. How you doing?

771
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,038
Howard Stern.
Nice to see you.

772
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,097
Listened to your show
last night. It was great.

773
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,641
Lookin' forward
to working with you.

774
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,837
Don't hurt yourself,
man.

775
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,709
OK, thanks.
Thank you.

776
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,304
Thank you.

777
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,475
What am I
thanking him for?

778
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,711
So let's review.

779
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,412
My life sucked,

780
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,852
Alison dumped me,

781
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,651
I didn't know if she'd
ever come back to me,

782
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,624
and now this dickwad
is calling me Big Bird.

783
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,183
106 FM, WWWW.

784
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,321
I don't know.
Something in me just snapped.

785
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:07,830
My name
is Howard Stern,

786
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,867
and welcome to
the new morning show.

787
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,401
And we have
a new feature for you.

788
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,369
This is, uh,
something special.

789
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,929
We have a traffic copter now
here at WWWW.

790
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,171
Let's go up to Mama Look-a boo boo day
in the traffic copter.

791
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,677
Mama, you there?

792
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,974
Hello? Mama? Uh.

793
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,815
Hello?

794
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,249
[Doing Mama's Voice] Yes, hello.
This is Mama Look-a boo boo day,

795
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:32,278
the only black traffic reporter
in the Detroit area,

796
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,880
I'm proud to say.

797
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,085
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance this morning, Mama.

798
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,027
Tell me, uh, what's going on
in the traffic?

799
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,724
First, a political
statement, if I may.

800
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,096
Kill, Kill, Kill...

801
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,365
The White Man,

802
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,465
by Eugene
Mama Look-a boo boo day.

803
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,976
Eugene is my pen name 'cause
I wrote this while I was in the pen.

804
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,945
OK, here we go.

805
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,216
Kill, kill,
kill the white man.

806
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,518
Kill him
until he is dead.

807
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,924
Kill the white man.

808
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,496
Thank you.

809
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,940
Yeah, hi. Can I speak
to Alison Stern, please?

810
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,481
Her husband Howard.

811
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,039
It's Howard.

812
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,081
Hello?

813
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:42,683
# There must be some
kind of way out of here #

814
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,228
# Said the joker
to the thief #

815
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,889
# There's
too much confusion #

816
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:55,231
# I can't get no relief #

817
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,365
# Businessmen, they'll #

818
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,170
# They'll drink my wine #

819
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,973
# Plowmen dig my earth... #

820
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,714
You talk too much.

821
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,410
And very important,

822
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,578
I want the time
and the temperature

823
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,851
4 times every 15 minutes,
not 3. 4.

824
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,687
My grandmother
died last night.

825
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,695
I spent all night with her
in the hospital.

826
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,757
She... She
had a car accident.

827
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,732
By the way, uh...

828
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,431
It's 6:45. Temperature
is, uh, 58 degrees.

829
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,905
# No reason
to get excited #

830
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,965
Anyway, her head
went through the windshield.

831
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,510
You know, it's funny,
but her last words...

832
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,875
# The thief,
he kindly spoke #

833
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:40,115
# There are many here
among us #

834
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,549
I want you back
so bad...

835
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,578
# Who feel that life
is but a joke #

836
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,854
# But you and I,
we've been through that #

837
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,417
# And this not our fate... #

838
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,928
I had, like,
no listeners,

839
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,692
and the couple of listeners
I did have

840
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,562
Would call in and tell me
how bad I sucked

841
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,124
on a regular basis.

842
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,830
Although, I did manage to convince
one of them to be my weather lady.

843
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,497
Irene...
the weather girl.

844
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,835
Irene,
are you there?

845
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,103
It's cold, real cold,

846
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,338
but your ass
is gonna be plenty hot

847
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,539
when I give you a good,
hard butt-whipping.

848
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:11,808
Tongue.

849
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,611
What do you think
about that?

850
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,618
Turns you on, doesn't it,
you little maggot?

851
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,675
Yeah.

852
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,483
Irene, thank you
for the weather forecast.

853
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,488
Shut up.

854
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,024
We hope to hear
from you tomorrow...

855
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,286
Give us some
more weather.

856
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,555
Bite me, you loser.

857
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,701
You shaved
your mustache.

858
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,332
Jeez. Alison.

859
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,871
It's great to see you.

860
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,573
Al, I miss you so much.

861
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,444
I'm feelin' so miserable
since you left.

862
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,575
I am just so uncomfortable
in this Detroit. I'm...

863
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:48,913
Howard...

864
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,181
I'm willing to believe
you didn't sleep with that girl.

865
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,486
OK? And I understand
you're a somewhat abnormal person

866
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,788
with a somewhat abnormal job.
That I can accept.

867
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,726
I deal with abnormality
every single day.

868
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,661
I don't need everything
in my life to be normal.

869
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,926
And on the air,
you do what you do. That's your job.

870
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,663
But off the air,
for me to be in this marriage...

871
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,365
I need to know
I'm the only one.

872
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,431
And I'm not saying that
to pressure you.

873
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:15,070
I'm saying it because it's
just something I know about myself.

874
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,444
So... if you need more time
or whatever...

875
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:19,949
I don't need
any more time.

876
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,713
I am just so madly
in love with you.

877
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,517
I don't... I don't need
anyone else in my life.

878
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,420
I never wanted
anyone else in my life.

879
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,083
All I want is you.

880
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,061
I just want you
to forgive me.

881
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,302
Thanks for coming back.

882
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,630
Wow.

883
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,776
Come on, you guys.
Right up here looks perfect.

884
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,242
Isn't Alison amazing?

885
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,835
She's in town,
like, 2 minutes,

886
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:52,849
and already she's got a job
working with a bunch of wackos.

887
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,385
Excuse me.
Mentally challenged.

888
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,785
Nice day, huh?

889
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,720
What can I do
to help here?

890
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,815
Well, I'm gonna
set up lunch...

891
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:02,859
OK.

892
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,555
And you can play frisbee
with the guys.

893
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,393
Start again.
Here we go.

894
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,696
Oh. I'm so sorry.

895
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,702
Listen, what you
got to do is,

896
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,362
you got to put
this hand up, OK?

897
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,303
And you got to try
and catch it, OK?

898
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,273
All right,
here we go.

899
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:19,934
Ready? Here we go.

900
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,546
I'm so sorry.

901
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,816
You know what
we're gonna do?

902
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,284
Just tell me that you're ready.
Are you ready?

903
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:30,752
Y-Yes.

904
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:34,118
Howard! Howard!

905
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,123
Marvin.

906
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,057
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

907
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,924
I have some
very exciting news!

908
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,588
Oh. Are you
all right?

909
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,722
Yeah. Yeah.

910
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:42,993
That was good.

911
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,900
You just got to wait
till somebody looks, OK?

912
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:50,134
Hoo. Uh, well, we decided that
Detroit has too many rock stations,

913
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,732
so starting tomorrow
we're starting a new format,

914
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,778
and it'll give us
a real great edge.

915
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,416
# Ooh ooh #

916
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,214
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
dee dee #

917
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,255
# Ooh doo #

918
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,153
# Doo-doop
doo-doo-doo #

919
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,590
# Doo doo ooh #

920
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,649
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
dee dee... #

921
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,127
Howdy, cowpokes.

922
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,255
Uh, I know I shouldn't be
interrupting in the middle of a song,

923
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,662
but I got to
tell you something.

924
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,667
I know a lot of you out there
really love this music,

925
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,168
but I just don't get it.

926
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,396
Explain it to me.

927
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,405
And maybe it's 'cause
I went to college,

928
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,407
and I never drove a truck

929
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,342
and had sex with
my daddy's sister, but...

930
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,504
I guess what I'm
trying to say is, I...

931
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,171
I don't think
I'm the man for this job.

932
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,979
So this is your old pal
Hopalong Howie saying I quit.

933
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,349
L... I think I quit.

934
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,718
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
dee dee #

935
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,383
# Ooh doo #

936
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,426
# Doo-doop
doo-doo-doo #

937
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,689
# Doo doo ooh #

938
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,129
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
dee dee #

939
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:49,495
# Oh #

940
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,534
# Dee dee dee #

941
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,132
What?

942
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,263
Nothing.

943
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,783
What is it?

944
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,615
I feel like
such a loser.

945
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,384
It's not your fault.
It was a lame station.

946
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,822
Yeah, it was my fault.

947
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,087
You can't blame a radio station.
It's my screwup.

948
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,423
In what way?

949
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,429
In a way that I gotta
figure out what I'm gonna be.

950
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,465
I mean, I don't want to be
one of these disc jockeys

951
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,730
that runs around the country, you know,
looking for work all the time.

952
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:28,169
I don't want to end up like that.
It's so sad.

953
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,502
It's so apparent to me now
what I should be doing.

954
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:32,337
I should be talking
about my personal life.

955
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,343
I've got to get intimate.

956
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,641
And every time I feel like
I shouldn't say something,

957
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,773
maybe I should just say it,
just blurt it out, you know?

958
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,579
I just got to
let things fly.

959
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,586
I got to go all the way.

960
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,087
You didn't go
all the way before?

961
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,418
No. I mean...

962
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,823
No. A lot of times,
I'm just holding back.

963
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,731
Then I guess you should
go all the way.

964
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,268
Hold the sign
nice and low.

965
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,963
With a big smile...
Very sexy...

966
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,369
This is about Howard
coming to Washington.

967
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,599
What's going on here?

968
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:04,901
Um, we're
shooting a movie.

969
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,203
Hey,
you got a permit?

970
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,538
Uh, no, we don't
have a permit,

971
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,101
but this is,
like, one line,

972
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,942
and we'll be done with them in a second
and we'll be out of your way.

973
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,448
You can't be there, then.
You're blocking the median.

974
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:13,847
Come on, you're
gonna have to move.

975
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,612
Um, this if for
the Howard Stern movie.

976
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,347
Wait a minute.
You said Howard Stern?

977
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,615
Yeah.
This is his movie.

978
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,746
Is Howard here?

979
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,415
No, he's not here today,
not in this scene,

980
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,550
but this is his movie.

981
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,184
Come on.
You got to move.

982
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,956
Tsk. Give us a break.
It'll take a second.

983
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,292
Just look right
at the camera,

984
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,592
and say, "Howard
comes to Washington."

985
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,929
Howard comes
to Washington.

986
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,160
Hey, let's go!
Come on!

987
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,203
Howard's, like,
a big fan of the cops.

988
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,498
He loves you guys.

989
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:35,970
We could have
been done by now.

990
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,234
Guess what.
You are done.

991
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,640
I was hired by
an FM rock station, DC 101,

992
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,212
and that's when I met
the other woman in my life.

993
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,713
Howard?

994
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,376
Hi. I'm Robin Quivers,
your newswoman.

995
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,249
Oh. Oh, I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

996
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,309
It's great to meet you.

997
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:52,320
Same here.

998
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,016
Yeah, this is
gonna be great.

999
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,322
OK, I'm just gonna go over here
and work on my script.

1000
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,385
We're almost set.

1001
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,657
Ooh. 

1002
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,101
Ahem.

1003
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,230
DC 101. Good morning.
This is Howard Stern.

1004
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,864
Welcome to the show.

1005
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,171
I have a confession
to make.

1006
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,541
I did not get, uh,
laid last night.

1007
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,911
In fact, I haven't gotten laid
in a really long time.

1008
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,246
Now, give me a call
here at DC 101

1009
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,218
if you have
the same kind of problem.

1010
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,219
Having trouble
with your woman?

1011
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,915
Give me a call.
I'll help you out.

1012
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,889
Let me introduce,
over here to my right,

1013
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:31,655
my beautiful new newswoman
Robin Quivers, who looks so beautiful,

1014
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,755
I'm sure she doesn't have
any of these sexual problems.

1015
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:38,700
But I must tell you,
my life is, um, very odd.

1016
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,703
I get hornier
and hornier.

1017
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,672
My wife, she comes home from work,
she goes to sleep.

1018
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,698
The whole week goes by,
she never gets horny.

1019
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,040
Robin, as a woman,
what is it?

1020
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,137
Do women get horny?

1021
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,083
Sometimes.

1022
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,248
Why is he talking
to his newsperson?

1023
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,723
I'll have him stop.

1024
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,316
What about you
specifically, though?

1025
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,988
When is the last time
that you were with a man...

1026
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,156
sexually?

1027
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,590
About a year.

1028
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,363
You're serious?

1029
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,631
- A year?
- Yeah.

1030
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,002
A year,
ladies and gentlemen.

1031
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,335
Someone more pathetic
than me.

1032
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,068
This is good. This is good.
We're getting somewhere.

1033
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,235
This is a good
discussion.

1034
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,835
Uh, you know,
I bought a book,

1035
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,403
"How to Score with Babes,"

1036
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,880
and listen
to what it says.

1037
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,143
I think
it's rather revealing.

1038
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,515
"When attempting
to score with a babe,

1039
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:31,520
"make sure to wear
tight pants.

1040
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:34,682
"If necessary, stuff
a semirigid, large object

1041
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:35,952
"into your pants

1042
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,426
to create the appearance
of having a large penis."

1043
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,360
Women like large penis.

1044
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,694
Did he say "penis"?

1045
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,233
I know about this stuff.

1046
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,599
I have no bulge in my crotch.
I have a small penis.

1047
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,570
And I've never told
anyone this before...

1048
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,266
And I don't think
you should start now.

1049
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,672
Well, I've done it.
Now the cat's out of the bag.

1050
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,335
But this guy
wrote a good book.

1051
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,572
The author has slept
with over 16,000 women,

1052
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,137
and, uh,
take it from him.

1053
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,683
He says
wear tight pants.

1054
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,311
If he slept
with 16,000 women,

1055
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,151
he wouldn't have time
to put on pants.

1056
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,987
That is true, too.
I didn't consider that.

1057
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:10,320
Why don't you
give me a call at DC 101

1058
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,327
if you want
to talk about this.

1059
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,159
We'll be back
right after these words.

1060
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,731
You're a genius.

1061
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,995
That was great.

1062
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,400
That was interesting.

1063
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,495
Didn't that feel good?
That was great.

1064
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,904
You say
whatever you want.

1065
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,340
You have carte blanche.

1066
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,345
You and Robin must not talk
to each other on the air.

1067
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,176
And don't sing along
with the music.

1068
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,841
And you know
what else you could do?

1069
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,146
I'd like you to memorize
the names of the local high schools.

1070
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,982
And don't criticize
Washington.

1071
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,680
It's not good for ratings.

1072
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,055
Now, if you'll excuse us, we'd like
to talk to Robin alone for a second.

1073
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,422
Wait. I wanted...

1074
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,927
You know what I want you
to do for me,

1075
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,793
is to make up a grid
of all your comedy bits

1076
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,297
and the corresponding
days of the week,

1077
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,596
so that I'll know on which day
you'll be doing which bit.

1078
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,933
I told you I work spontaneously.
I think that l...

1079
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,669
Robin...
don't encourage him.

1080
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,714
He's better
when he's toned down.

1081
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:08,876
We need you to be
a friend here, Robin.

1082
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,147
I'll see
what I can do.

1083
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,052
Great.

1084
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,385
Appreciate it,
Robin.

1085
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,549
- OK.
- Thanks.

1086
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,528
I think we should
separate them.

1087
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,531
Orioles over the Red Sox
3-2 last night,

1088
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,533
extending the Os'
winning streak to 7.

1089
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,535
And finally,
today is Memorial Day.

1090
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:30,038
Sunny skies and warm temperatures
for veterans marching in parades

1091
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,539
across the metropolitan area.

1092
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,543
Highs today in the 70s.
It's 58 degrees...

1093
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,546
You know, Robin, let me
interrupt for a second.

1094
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,548
I'm glad you brought up
Memorial Day.

1095
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,550
I was in Vietnam.
I'd like to talk to you about it.

1096
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,552
I had 11 kills
in Vietnam,

1097
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,055
and I'm telling you,
I really should've had more.

1098
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,057
Officially, I should've
had more kills.

1099
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,059
Let me tell you
what I'm talking about.

1100
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,095
I was in a gook village,
and I come upon a schoolhouse.

1101
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,926
So I grab one of
my grenades off my belt,

1102
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,761
and I throw it right
into the schoolhouse.

1103
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,028
And I blow up
the whole damn thing.

1104
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,161
So I'm out there
counting all the bodies.

1105
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,330
You threw a grenade
into a school?

1106
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,340
That's exactly
what I'm telling you.

1107
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,171
I must've killed, like,
200 kids.

1108
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,871
My dickhead lieutenant
comes up to me, and he says,

1109
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,847
"Stern, those are little kids.
That counts as one person."

1110
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,850
Howard, I was
in the military.

1111
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,318
I was a captain in the Air Force.
What were you?

1112
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,820
What was I?

1113
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,412
Yeah, what were you?

1114
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,492
- What were you again?
- I was a captain.

1115
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,493
That's what I was.
I was a captain.

1116
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,994
And what were you in?

1117
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,529
I was in Vietnam.

1118
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,292
Ohh! Army? Navy?

1119
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,298
In the Army.

1120
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,301
Did you have a division?

1121
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,301
103rd.

1122
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,302
103rd what?

1123
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,804
I was in the 103rd...

1124
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,305
I don't know
what I was in, Robin,

1125
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,399
But I'm saying I was
in the 103rd.

1126
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,410
And the point
of this whole thing

1127
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,242
is that I think a kill
is a kill is a kill,

1128
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,748
and killing a kid should be
just as good as killing an adult.

1129
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:51,412
Well, I suppose even if you're killing
children, they should count them.

1130
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,480
I got some music
for you now at DC 101.

1131
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:56,684
Ha ha!

1132
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,722
You're not even old enough
to have been in Vietnam.

1133
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,728
Duh.

1134
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,765
I couldn't sit there
and not say something.

1135
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,268
I knew they had told me
not to talk.

1136
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,771
I knew I was going to get
in trouble if I did.

1137
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,773
But he was really
onto something,

1138
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,777
and I knew that there was
something going on there...

1139
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,279
and I just went for it.

1140
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:23,318
Well, this just came
from the FCC.

1141
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,820
Did you say "testicles"
on the air?

1142
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:26,856
Wait a second.

1143
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,822
Screw the FCC.
We just lost Muffler Man.

1144
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,826
Hold on. We have
a real problem here.

1145
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,327
I'm just trying
to get ratings.

1146
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,760
I am just trying
to run a radio station.

1147
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,456
I understand that,
and I'm telling you

1148
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,363
that the commercial sponsors
are there once you get the ratings.

1149
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,458
There's a big problem.

1150
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,196
They're gonna be
lining up 10 in a row.

1151
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,397
You listen to me,
you stupid asshole.

1152
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:45,202
Radio is a business, and
you just cost us $40,000.

1153
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:48,904
Wait a second. If I do a lame show,
it's never gonna take off.

1154
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,912
I'm calm.
I am perfectly calm.

1155
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,779
D.C. Carpet canceled
because of him.

1156
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,715
Well, I've reached
my limit.

1157
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,980
I don't know about you,
but my back is against the wall.

1158
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,316
Will everyone
just sit down?

1159
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,515
I just want to say
one thing.

1160
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,023
I really think this show's
starting to take off.

1161
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,525
There's a buzz
on the street about it.

1162
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,527
If we just give it a chance,
if we just take some time with it,

1163
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,654
I think everything's
gonna be OK.

1164
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,631
Don't push
your luck, Howard.

1165
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,429
The countdown to our "Live
Life Like a Millionaire Sweepstakes"

1166
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,594
is getting closer.

1167
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,501
We're going to
have winners take...

1168
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,504
Hey!

1169
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,597
Hi, honey.

1170
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,074
Robin Leach says we
should move to Antigua.

1171
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,577
Oh, yeah?
Come on, hurry up.

1172
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,442
Snap to it.
I'm ovulating.

1173
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:27,449
I'm in the middle of
important show research.

1174
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,452
Howard, seriously,
come on.

1175
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,454
You know what?
You're getting baby fever here.

1176
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,955
And you know, maybe
it's a little premature.

1177
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,958
I'm about 3 days away from being fired,
the way I figure it.

1178
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,960
And do you want
to know something?

1179
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,461
You got to think about
the economics of this.

1180
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,463
You're gonna be the best morning man
in the history of radio.

1181
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,123
At any minute, you're
gonna be number one.

1182
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,461
- Is that so?
- Yeah! Strip!

1183
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:45,796
Let me tell you something.
Look at yourself.

1184
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,302
You're completely on fire
about having a baby.

1185
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,304
You don't understand.
I'm not a piece of meat.

1186
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,033
I mean,
I have to be romanced.

1187
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,972
Oh, yeah. Please.

1188
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,978
Ooh, look at that bra.
Where did you get that?

1189
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,206
You like this?

1190
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,713
OK. That's it.
That's it!

1191
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,647
I am making a baby!

1192
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,776
It's baby time!
I'm ready to give you a baby.

1193
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:03,784
Thank you.

1194
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:04,785
Hold on.

1195
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:08,923
OK. Now I'm hot.

1196
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,425
Now I actually
want to have sex.

1197
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,119
I didn't before
and now I do.

1198
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,560
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous...

1199
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,064
Robin, watch this.

1200
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,865
What am I doing?

1201
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,735
Uh, having a seizure?

1202
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,741
No, that's not a seizure.
That's me dancing

1203
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,903
because I'm happy
'cause I got laid last night.

1204
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,240
- Oh!
- Yeah, I really did.

1205
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,247
In fact,
it was not for lust.

1206
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,907
It was 'cause I was
making a kid.

1207
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,918
- Oh.
- In fact, my wife's eggs are very old.

1208
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,783
They're very, you know,
she's getting older.

1209
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,287
But my sperm
is like supersperm,

1210
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,516
so I'm pretty sure everything
was delivered in one shot.

1211
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,525
Oh, yeah.
Your sperm are fine.

1212
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,527
My sperm are fantastic.
I'm fantastic.

1213
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,029
I'm in a good mood.
Let's take some phone calls

1214
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,531
and see what's doing
out there.

1215
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,032
- OK.
- Hi, you're on the air.

1216
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,591
Hi,
is this Howard Stern?

1217
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,761
This is Howard.

1218
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,270
Oh, whoa.
Anyway, I was calling

1219
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,101
because I have
a really big problem.

1220
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,333
What's your problem?

1221
00:52:58,408 --> 00:52:59,898
Well, every morning
I lie in bed,

1222
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,443
and the only thing
I can do is think of you.

1223
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,105
Oh, really? Well, let's see if we
can't help you with your problem.

1224
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:05,442
What do you look like?

1225
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:09,076
Well, I've got blond hair,
and I've got blue eyes,

1226
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:12,588
and my measurements
are about 38-24-34.

1227
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,453
Some people tell me I look
a lot like Farrah Fawcett.

1228
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,550
I can help you.
Robin, I can help this girl.

1229
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,061
You know, we have the most
beautiful audience.

1230
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,621
We certainly do. We're
very fortunate that way.

1231
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,064
You know what we're gonna do
to solve your problem?

1232
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,102
I'm gonna have sex with you
right now over the radio.

1233
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,568
How are we gonna do that?

1234
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,901
Very simple.
I've thought this through, Robin.

1235
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,567
First of all, what kind of radio
are you listening to us on?

1236
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,577
You have a transistor radio, or you
have one of those big sound systems?

1237
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,112
I have
one of those big sound systems.

1238
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,238
Good. OK.

1239
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,077
Could you turn the treble
all the way down

1240
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,378
and put the bass
all the way up?

1241
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,719
OK. The treble's down,
and the bass is up.

1242
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:48,188
Take your speaker...
You got a big speaker?

1243
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:49,121
Yes, I do.

1244
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,625
Lay it flat
on the floor.

1245
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,390
And I want you to sort
of straddle the speaker.

1246
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,896
- Howard!
- Do what?

1247
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,763
A woman cannot be aroused
in that way.

1248
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,098
No. This is really wrong, Robin.
You're absolutely wrong.

1249
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,104
In fact, my father
was a radio engineer,

1250
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,265
and he proved
this theory years ago.

1251
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,831
You've got to believe.

1252
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,276
Now, what I need you to do is put
your private area over the woofer.

1253
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:10,608
I can't believe you're
really making me to do this.

1254
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,170
Come on, do it.

1255
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,547
Right up against it
so you can feel me.

1256
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,021
I'm on.

1257
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,148
Oh, I have
to ask her a question.

1258
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:25,354
What kind of a woman are you
to have sex this way on the radio?

1259
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,123
Don't answer that question.
Bad question.

1260
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,960
You're gonna ruin
this woman's mood.

1261
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,966
She might start
second-guessing.

1262
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,228
Are you ready
to have sex?

1263
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,735
Oh, my God.

1264
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,768
Ooh!

1265
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,402
Oohh!

1266
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,039
Ooh. It kinda tingles.

1267
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,606
See? It tingles.
She likes it.

1268
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:48,616
Yeah, sure.

1269
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,080
Ohh! Oh...

1270
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,226
She's full of it.

1271
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,096
Aahh!

1272
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:07,068
Ohh! Oh, God! Oh!

1273
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,468
Listen to her.
She's going wild.

1274
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,165
You got me moaning.

1275
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,087
Oh, my goodness.

1276
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,089
Ohhh!

1277
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,059
This is the best sex
I ever had.

1278
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:37,065
Ooh! Standing ovation.
Thank you.

1279
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,225
- Oh, boy.
- Thank you.

1280
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,893
Take your bows.

1281
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,438
A woman on the air
had an orgasm.

1282
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,939
Have you lost your mind?

1283
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,441
But you got to admit,
it was a funny bit.

1284
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,942
The audience loved
that stuff.

1285
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,444
We just lost Stereo City.

1286
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,742
This is not Muffler Man.
This is Stereo fucking City.

1287
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,612
Dee Dee, you know
there's gonna be other sponsors.

1288
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,550
No, there's not, Howard, 'cause
your career is over. You're finished.

1289
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,416
Come on!
How can you say that?

1290
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,115
Dee Dee,
I don't believe it.

1291
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,215
He's up.

1292
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,316
He's up?

1293
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,418
In the new ratings book,
he's up... 2 points.

1294
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,019
I love you.

1295
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,531
2 full points,
and Pizza Shack called.

1296
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,533
They want to buy time
on the Stern show.

1297
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,535
I go to Pizza Shack
all the time. Great.

1298
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,537
This is a great time
to talk

1299
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,038
about putting some money
into the show.

1300
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:18,768
I know a guy,
he does voices, he does comedy.

1301
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:21,276
Absolutely not.
This could be a fluke.

1302
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,643
I guarantee you we'll go up 2 full
rating points if you hire this guy.

1303
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,238
This guy
must be hot.

1304
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,250
This guy is
total personality.

1305
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,808
He's electric.

1306
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,559
Hey, Rick.
How's tricks, buddy?

1307
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,065
I've been coughing all day.

1308
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:47,570
I feel like I'm about
to cough up a lung.

1309
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,800
[Cough] Blecch!

1310
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,432
Waaa!

1311
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,342
Oh, no! It's Lucy!

1312
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:57,278
# You got me so I can't
sleep at night #

1313
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:00,783
# Girl,
you really got me now #

1314
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,444
# You got me so I don't know
where I'm going #

1315
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,112
Thank you very much.

1316
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,122
# Yeah, you really
got me now #

1317
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,658
# You got me so
I can't sleep at night #

1318
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,752
# You really got me,
You really got me... #

1319
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,024
Once the three of us
were together, everything felt right.

1320
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:15,932
I mean, things really
started to take off.

1321
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,024
I mean, things really
started to take off.

1322
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,796
It was then that I made
a startling discovery.

1323
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,202
She's a beautiful girl. You're telling
me this beautiful woman is a lesbian?

1324
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,503
Lesbians
equal ratings.

1325
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,167
Now let me say something.

1326
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:28,870
I am the hero
of the lesbian community,

1327
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,037
am I not, Robin?

1328
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,205
I guess you are.

1329
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,407
I absolutely am.

1330
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,210
All right. Now,
let's get into it.

1331
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:38,345
Julie, I want you to tell us
about your first lesbianic experience.

1332
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,547
OK.

1333
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,056
Tell me about the secret world
of lesbian sex.

1334
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,059
Well, Howard, I was 18.

1335
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,560
Oh, you were so young.

1336
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,062
Right. And I was working
at a summer camp.

1337
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,063
Yes?

1338
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,396
And I was lying
in my bunk,

1339
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:53,561
and the camp director's wife
walked in.

1340
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,035
Ooh, now, that's hot.

1341
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,231
Uh, everyone was asleep,

1342
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,070
and I'm lying
in my bunk,

1343
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,575
and she sees me
looking at her.

1344
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,076
And then
what happens?

1345
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,579
She, like, signals
for me to go with her.

1346
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,080
What are you sleeping in?

1347
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,582
'Cause this is
what I picture.

1348
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,584
Little cotton panties,
a tight little undershirt.

1349
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,813
No. I'm wearing, like,
little baby-doll pajamas.

1350
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,981
Oh, you tease.

1351
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:16,992
So then she takes me
into this tent.

1352
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,029
When you walk in, lesbians
all over the place, right?

1353
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,690
I mean, a whole lesbian
sex festival, right?

1354
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,029
Oh, you know it, Howard.

1355
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,068
Howard?

1356
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:27,067
Ohh!

1357
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,068
Howard?

1358
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:30,605
Alison on line 3.
It is important.

1359
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,903
Do you believe this, in the middle
of Lesbian Dating Game,

1360
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,409
my wife calls in?

1361
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:36,377
Maybe she wants to play.

1362
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,380
Honey, you want to play?
You want a date with Julie?

1363
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,881
Am I on the air?

1364
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,382
Yes, honey, of course
you're on the air.

1365
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,385
I told them I wanted
to talk to you off the air.

1366
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:46,388
But, honey, you're in the middle of
interrupting a beautiful, sexy moment.

1367
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,549
You've got to tell everyone. My audience
wants to know why you're interrupting.

1368
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,922
Don't you want to know,
Robin?

1369
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,392
I think we deserve to.

1370
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:55,124
Yes, honey... Uh-oh, Al?
I think she's gone.

1371
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,063
No. I'm pregnant.

1372
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,566
What?

1373
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,569
I'm pregnant.

1374
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:03,572
Congratulations,
Howard.

1375
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,406
It's my supersperm. I knew
my supersperm would do it, Robin.

1376
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:08,466
You're so blessed.

1377
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:09,842
Julie says we're blessed,
honey,

1378
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,380
and Julie would know
these things.

1379
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,415
Well, I appreciate her support.
Can we talk privately now?

1380
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:14,643
Absolutely, sweetheart.

1381
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,014
Wait a minute. Does she
know what she's gonna have?

1382
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,279
Is it gonna be a lesbian?

1383
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,218
Oh, please, Robin!
You've gone too far.

1384
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,383
No offense, Julie.
Please, I don't need this aggravation.

1385
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,484
We're gonna take a break. We'll get back
to making out with the lesbians

1386
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:26,995
right after these words.

1387
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,831
- Hi.
- Hey.

1388
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,025
I can't believe it.

1389
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,533
I can't believe you made me
do that on the air.

1390
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,035
It's so exciting.
Did you call your mother?

1391
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,536
I called, I called.
I feel so different.

1392
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:36,537
I know.

1393
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,039
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1394
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,540
I'm flipping
out, too.

1395
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,042
I'm somebody's
father.

1396
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,873
Oh, my God!

1397
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,481
Love him or hate him,

1398
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,846
unconventional
disc jockey Howard Stern

1399
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,851
jumped to the top
of the ratings today,

1400
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,921
making him number one
in greater Washington.

1401
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,980
I took a dump of a
radio station and returned it to glory.

1402
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,992
I look like Hitler.

1403
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,994
I was thrilled, totally overjoyed.

1404
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,496
I mean, we were gonna have
our first child,

1405
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:03,998
and 6 weeks later,
the new ratings came out.

1406
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:06,501
We destroyed every other
station in the market.

1407
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,002
My life was perfect.

1408
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:10,005
I'm gonna grab
this guy's hat,

1409
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:11,506
if they show it.

1410
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,445
I'll tell you another thing...

1411
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:18,946
Look, watch this.

1412
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,448
You're gonna miss it.

1413
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,448
Come here.

1414
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,917
I am Officer Howie,

1415
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:27,286
and there's a new law in town.
We're taking it over.

1416
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,456
How!

1417
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:30,958
I love you.

1418
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,963
Al, you OK?

1419
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:38,296
I think
something's wrong.

1420
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,802
Even if I'd put you
in the hospital

1421
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,303
and I pumped you full
of every medication possible,

1422
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,864
you still would've lost
the pregnancy.

1423
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,821
Your body rejected
what was going on.

1424
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,824
And that's so healthy.
It's such a good way to look at it.

1425
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:06,827
And in a couple of months,
we're gonna try to have a baby again,

1426
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,328
and everything's
gonna go great.

1427
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:11,333
You're gonna be totally confident
that everything's going good

1428
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,426
because you know your
body would reject it

1429
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,436
if it wasn't going
right... you know?

1430
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:20,441
I have to tell my parents.

1431
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,445
Not really.
We don't have to tell your parents.

1432
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,947
You know
what you could do?

1433
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,451
I didn't want
to tell you this,

1434
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,953
but I took a polaroid
of the toilet.

1435
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,957
And we can just mail them
a picture of that,

1436
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,959
and they can walk
around Florida, you know,

1437
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,460
and say it was
our grandchild,

1438
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,462
and your mother
will be so happy.

1439
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,464
She just wants pictures
to show her friends.

1440
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:44,965
- No.
- You know that.

1441
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,468
She just wants to be like all
the other yentas who walk around.

1442
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,472
You know, we could name the baby
and everything. Clumpy... Clumpy Stern.

1443
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:55,476
She could walk around with your father
and little Clumpy pictures.

1444
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,780
# All the weather #

1445
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,145
# Now here's God #

1446
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,149
Your Holiness.

1447
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,480
Hello, Howard.

1448
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:04,985
There you are.

1449
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,988
I see your wife
had a miscarriage.

1450
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,489
Aw, don't bring
that up, God.

1451
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:09,990
Please, that's way
too personal.

1452
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:13,495
You tried to have a baby,
and you failed.

1453
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:14,494
Oh, man!

1454
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,997
Now the baby is with me!

1455
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,499
This is crazy.

1456
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:20,501
Boy, what a loser you are.

1457
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:23,504
Wow! He's getting awfully
personal this morning.

1458
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,006
Hey, God, me and my wife
are trying to have another baby.

1459
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,236
A real man would have done it
right the first time.

1460
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,743
Oh, for God's sake.

1461
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,747
It'll be pleasant today. Rain tomorrow.

1462
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,248
That's my kid up there.

1463
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,786
This is God with the weather
on DC 101.

1464
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,014
You're all wrong, God.

1465
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,953
You're completely
out of line this morning.

1466
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,457
I don't think we should be
talking about this.

1467
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,791
I went to the doctor with my wife,
and it was an awful experience,

1468
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,296
because the doctor walks out,
and there's the kid,

1469
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,457
your beautiful child,

1470
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,797
and he's no bigger than
the size of an aspirin.

1471
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,302
Howie Jr., no bigger
than the size of an aspirin.

1472
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,804
Was it a boy?

1473
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,806
It was a boy, yes.
He had a little tiny penis.

1474
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:02,036
And then you look at him,
and he's in the formaldehyde jar.

1475
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,045
And I said to my wife,
"Honey, don't be upset

1476
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,047
that Howard Jr.'s
in a formaldehyde jar.

1477
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,049
We're gonna take him out of
this office, we'll bring him home,

1478
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,108
and next week we'll bring him
to the zoo in a stroller."

1479
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:11,983
Oh, please!

1480
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,646
I don't want to talk
about it, Robin.

1481
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:15,087
I really think
you need counseling.

1482
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,422
I'm gonna play a record.
DC 101.

1483
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,484
We got some great tunes
for you this morning,

1484
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,622
and then Robin will analyze me
when we get back from this song.

1485
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:24,689
Very sad music.

1486
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,234
Not that, Fred.
Play something else, please.

1487
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,737
For God's sake.

1488
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,002
DC 101. Here's
rock 'n' roll for you.

1489
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,517
Hi. Al, you home?

1490
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,256
Hi. How you feeling?
You OK?

1491
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,258
How could you do that?
Do you think that was funny?

1492
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,261
You think it's funny to make jokes
about our personal life like that?

1493
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,762
You're an asshole!

1494
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,593
What are you
talking about?

1495
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,792
Alison, I love you.
What are you talking about?

1496
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,801
Howard, not everything
is for your audience.

1497
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,497
I need a life that is ours,
that belongs to us.

1498
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,541
I'm on the air 5 hours a day.
I'm trying to come up with material.

1499
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,768
I hate going out.

1500
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,207
Too bad!

1501
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,541
I said when we came here,
if I was gonna win on the radio,

1502
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,342
I'd have to talk about everything.
I couldn't hold back.

1503
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:15,281
- Howard...
- Come on, last night
we were laughing about this.

1504
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,376
I just assumed
you thought it was funny.

1505
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,182
It was funny for us
last night.

1506
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,517
Privately, for us.

1507
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,490
Alison, if I don't talk about
you and me on the air...

1508
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:23,490
Shut up. Shut up.

1509
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:24,992
The audience isn't
gonna be there.

1510
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:25,992
Shut up! Shut up!

1511
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:26,993
I won't make any money.

1512
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:27,994
Shut up!
You disgust me!

1513
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,962
I can't even look
at you, idiot!

1514
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,736
It's hard, you know.

1515
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:40,241
When he shares our most personal
details of our life together

1516
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:42,743
with, you know,
millions of listeners, it's...

1517
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:48,515
I wish that there were
more things that could be just ours.

1518
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,021
But I think it's right that
I go crazy, you know?

1519
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:58,025
You know, I think...
I don't know.

1520
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:59,526
It's not simple.

1521
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:07,332
Our entire Washington
radio audience has disappeared.

1522
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,837
It seems the competition
has a disc jockey

1523
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:14,103
that's caused a bit of a shift
in the listening patterns.

1524
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:18,875
One disc jockey has wiped out
our entire audience?

1525
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,346
Can we get him?

1526
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,212
I've got such good news.
It's gonna blow your mind.

1527
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,721
All right.
You go first.

1528
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,223
OK. All right,
That's rude. You go first.

1529
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,224
Go first.

1530
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,726
OK. Listen to this.

1531
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,762
I listen to radio.
I like show.

1532
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,764
But don't make fun
of the Chinese people.

1533
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:38,424
Make fun, not funny.

1534
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:39,933
I didn't make fun
of the Chinese people, did I?

1535
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:40,934
Probably.

1536
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,164
I bring egg rolls.

1537
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:47,508
What is your news?
What is it?

1538
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,510
It's unbelievable.

1539
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:52,570
I got a job offer today
from WNBC in New York.

1540
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:56,084
Afternoon drive, the most powerful
radio station in their chain,

1541
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:57,584
$150,000 a year.

1542
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,087
And they said
if I do really well,

1543
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,419
they're gonna syndicate
my program all over the country.

1544
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,425
This is it.
This is everything I want.

1545
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,326
It's like...
It's the dream, the Big Apple.

1546
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:10,024
I'm pregnant.

1547
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,228
You're pregnant?

1548
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,964
Mm-hmm.

1549
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,432
Come here.

1550
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:21,441
What?

1551
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,137
Come here.
Just come here.

1552
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:24,474
Come here.

1553
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,478
My God.

1554
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:26,479
Pregnant?

1555
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,848
So what's going on?
What's gonna happen?

1556
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:30,851
Everything's good.

1557
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,852
Yeah?

1558
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,354
She's gonna
get naked?

1559
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:34,855
Yeah, sure. Of course.

1560
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,358
All right. Let's get her out.
Let's do it.

1561
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,859
She'll get naked?

1562
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:40,361
Yeah. That's why
we're here, man.

1563
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:42,962
OK, honey.

1564
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,498
Hi. How's it going?

1565
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,967
- Oh, my God.
- This is Gary.

1566
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,502
How you doing?

1567
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:51,506
Good. I'm sorry. I know
I told you I'd do this,

1568
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:52,973
but I've really
changed my mind.

1569
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,508
I don't want to do it
anymore.

1570
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,511
OK. What's, uh, like,
what's the problem?

1571
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,513
What are you
worried about?

1572
01:06:58,581 --> 01:06:59,980
I just changed my mind.

1573
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:01,515
What do you mean?
You are doing it.

1574
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:03,518
We didn't drive here
for you to change your mind.

1575
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,520
No. It's just very
humiliating to me.

1576
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,520
What's humiliating?

1577
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:07,681
It's not that big a deal.

1578
01:07:07,757 --> 01:07:09,520
We've done it a lot
on the show.

1579
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,992
I think Howard would appreciate it
if you would do it for us.

1580
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,460
No. I changed my mind,
and I'm really sorry.

1581
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,465
I know I told you that I'd do it,
but I don't want to.

1582
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:18,966
I think it's
very humiliating.

1583
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:20,969
Honey, this is not humiliating.
This is show business.

1584
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,971
You got a great body.
Let everybody see it.

1585
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,472
Yeah. You're beautiful.

1586
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,974
You're my husband. Don't make me do
something I don't want to do.

1587
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,977
I'm proud of you,
and I want you to do it.

1588
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,979
That's why we drove here
from Jersey.

1589
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,981
What the hell is
this donkey here for?

1590
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,983
Nobody told me anything
about a donkey.

1591
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:36,143
It's a show business
donkey.

1592
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,651
The donkey's not part
of the act.

1593
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,153
It had nothing
to do with you.

1594
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,155
You'll feel at ease
once we go do it.

1595
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,656
It'll just
take 2 seconds.

1596
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,488
Right now, I need to know,
are you doing it or not?

1597
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,492
No, I'm not.

1598
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,994
Honey, you are doing it.

1599
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,497
I changed my mind. And you're
my husband. You should support me.

1600
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,157
Howard goes to New York.

1601
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,996
Thanks for nothing.
Gino, let the donkey go.

1602
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:56,493
Come on, guys. Wrap it up.
They're not doing it.

1603
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:04,239
# Let's dance #

1604
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,510
# Put on your red shoes #

1605
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,676
# And dance the blues #

1606
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,987
# Let's dance #

1607
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:18,960
# To the song they're
playing on the radio... #

1608
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,963
What you're about
to hear is going to shock you

1609
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,896
because it's vulgar
and obscene.

1610
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:27,265
It's x-rated radio,
barnyard radio.

1611
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,134
You mommies and daddies out there
who complained to the radio station,

1612
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,969
I got something
to say to you.

1613
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,736
Here. 

1614
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,970
This is a story
with a twist.

1615
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,138
While we were producing
this report,

1616
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:41,479
Howard Stern was lured away from
Washington by a New York City station.

1617
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:44,986
That station,
you guessed it, is WNBC...

1618
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:52,486
This person is coming here
to work at our flagship station?

1619
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:54,995
Yes.

1620
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:58,033
Brad, you gave this
trash-talking bastard a 3-year deal

1621
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,567
without even hearing him
on the air?

1622
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:00,567
Yes, Roger.

1623
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:01,728
He's on the FCC's
most-wanted list.

1624
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:02,793
Roger, his rate...

1625
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,065
Chuck, will you show
him the numbers.

1626
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:05,232
Through the roof.

1627
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,740
No, no. Don't bother.

1628
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,437
You're fired,
all of you. Get out.

1629
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:13,873
Get out!

1630
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,464
You know,
unless he quits,

1631
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,468
it's gonna cost half
a million dollars

1632
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,333
to buy
Stern's contract out.

1633
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,770
I reject that
on principle.

1634
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,970
Uh, Mr. Erlick,
if I may?

1635
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:45,079
Put me in charge
of the Stern show.

1636
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,081
Let me ride herd on him,

1637
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:50,118
and I'll mold that son of a bitch
into another Don Imus.

1638
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,483
When I'm through
whipping him,

1639
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:54,751
that boy will be asking
permission to wipe his ass.

1640
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:55,847
You want to tame him?

1641
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,892
Well,
either I'll tame him,

1642
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,951
or I'll make him
so crazy...

1643
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,154
he'll quit.

1644
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,324
So either way,
we win.

1645
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:08,034
I'll tell you,
these halls are, like,

1646
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,536
you know, uh,
legendary.

1647
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:10,799
It's pretty wild.

1648
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,033
Kenny. Howard Stern.

1649
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,369
Hi. Hey,
How you doing?

1650
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:14,306
Howard!

1651
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,604
Great to meet you.

1652
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,612
Oh, it is such a pleasure
to meet you, Howard.

1653
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,944
What can I say?
This is unbelievable, you know.

1654
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,449
Kenny is the hottest
young programmer in New York City.

1655
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:25,316
Howard, you gotta listen
to this man 'cause he's a genius.

1656
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,048
Come on, now.
Ha ha ha ha.

1657
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,054
Play nice.

1658
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,454
Thanks, man.
God bless.

1659
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:30,958
Good seeing you.
I'll see you later.

1660
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:32,015
He's terrific.

1661
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:33,389
Oh, yeah,
he's been terrific.

1662
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:34,895
Everyone's been so nice.
It's a good feeling.

1663
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,898
Howard, how about
you have a seat?

1664
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,526
Oh, Howard, Howard,
Howard, Howard, Howard.

1665
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,463
Howard... the way
we work here at NBC...

1666
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,976
is a more professional manner
than you're probably used to.

1667
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:51,740
Now, see, I don't care about
what you did down in Washington,

1668
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,748
'cause that's
chickenshit radio.

1669
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,876
Here at NBC,
this is real radio.

1670
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,386
And the first thing
you've gotta do

1671
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:02,219
is say the call letters
properly, OK?

1672
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:05,727
Now, I'm gonna teach you
how to say them, all right?

1673
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,058
And you know,
I hope you can get them,

1674
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:10,496
because, see, you don't
have a real good voice

1675
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:12,033
like lmus or Captain Frank
or nothing,

1676
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,966
so we're gonna
have to practice it.

1677
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,469
Well...

1678
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:18,233
you mean practice
in here now?

1679
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:21,970
You're not going to get bashful
on me now, are you, Howard?

1680
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,443
OK, you ready?

1681
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,844
The way it's said
properly is...

1682
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:30,752
W N BC.

1683
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,620
This is key.

1684
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,952
Come on.

1685
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,788
W N BC.

1686
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:38,792
No. No.

1687
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:40,419
It's gotta be more
like this.

1688
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:41,690
Listen up.

1689
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,732
W N BC.

1690
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,232
You hear that?

1691
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:47,531
Kinda lift,
that N BC.

1692
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:50,037
W N BC.

1693
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:52,801
W N BC.

1694
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:54,069
Wider and kind of...

1695
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,075
W N BC.

1696
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,076
One more.

1697
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,578
In my mind,
I'm hearing...

1698
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,511
It sounds like I'm saying
exactly what you're saying.

1699
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:00,513
No. Actually...

1700
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:01,708
W N BC.

1701
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:03,149
You've gotta
listen to Imus.

1702
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:05,652
Imus does it
perfectly.

1703
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:08,656
Tell you what. I'm gonna take you
down to lmus' office right now,

1704
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:10,988
and you're gonna hear how he does it.
Come on, boy.

1705
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,493
- You know, l...
- Come on.

1706
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:13,994
I gotta tell you
something, Kenny.

1707
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,928
I always saw myself sort of
something different than lmus.

1708
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,431
That's why
you hired me.

1709
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,933
You are original. You are original,
but... 

1710
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,936
You say a lot
of offensive things,

1711
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,938
and occasionally
you are real funny,

1712
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,440
but you've got to learn
to do what Imus does.

1713
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,033
See, he doesn't actually
say the bad thing himself.

1714
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,577
He says it
through a character.

1715
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,079
Yeah, well,
I don't do character...

1716
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:35,082
How about you go on
the air 3 A.M. This morning,

1717
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,583
show us some characters.
OK?

1718
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:39,018
Good. Now,
I'm gonna go in there

1719
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,182
and just see how he's feeling.
You stay here. OK?

1720
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:44,991
Mr. Imus?

1721
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,423
Back then,

1722
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,864
Don lmus was the number one
disc jockey in New York,

1723
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,629
so I guess I was kind of
curious to meet him.

1724
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,669
You are
interrupting me.

1725
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,137
I have, uh,
Howard Stern outside.

1726
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,230
You have who outside?

1727
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,807
The young man
from Washington that we...

1728
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,809
You have Howard Stern
outside my fucking office?

1729
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,004
How did Howard Stern
get outside my fucking office?

1730
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:05,341
I brought him down...

1731
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,278
Well, I'm not gonna meet
that stupid fuck. He's nothing.

1732
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:09,751
Fuck off!

1733
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:13,655
# 66 #

1734
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:14,349
# 66 #

1735
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,892
# WNBC #

1736
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,427
Hello. I'm Robin Quivers,

1737
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,520
and it's my great pleasure
to introduce you

1738
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,861
to New York's
newest disc jockey.

1739
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,367
Ooo-ey, that's me.

1740
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:30,132
Hi. I'm Lance Eluxina
on W N BC.

1741
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:31,137
WNBC.

1742
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,537
I'm so excited

1743
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:35,372
because I am New York's
first ever gay disc jockey.

1744
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:36,376
Ever!

1745
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:38,276
And now I want to
introduce to you...

1746
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:39,336
This is
so exciting...

1747
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:40,437
I want to introduce
to you

1748
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,608
someone so marvelous,
so wonderful to me,

1749
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:43,912
someone who
has supported me,

1750
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:46,113
is my life mate,
my soul mate, my love mate.

1751
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,850
He's everything and anything
to me, Mr. Blackswell.

1752
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,357
Willkommen. Bienvenue.

1753
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:53,384
Welcome. Oh, Robin, it's so lovely
to see you here today.

1754
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:54,826
Hi, Mr. Engineer. Hi.

1755
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,695
Mmm. Give me
a kiss. Mmm!

1756
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,132
You two are just
adorable together,

1757
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:02,670
and it's a wonderful thing
to have you here,

1758
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:05,229
but I understand there's
already been a problem?

1759
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,364
Yes. You know
about this?

1760
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,033
I was in the program
director's office.

1761
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:09,201
His name
is Pig Vomit.

1762
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,710
Yes, because he
looks like a pig,

1763
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:11,973
and he makes you
want to vomit.

1764
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:12,979
He's Pig Vomit.

1765
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,276
Anyway, Pig Vomit
says to me,

1766
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,044
"This is not WNBC.

1767
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,519
It is W N BC,
W N BC,"

1768
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,283
and I was not saying
the call letters right.

1769
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:22,618
It's a big problem,

1770
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,955
so in order
to rectify this,

1771
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,257
I brought in a cup
of Blackswell's semen.

1772
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,921
Semen?

1773
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,225
I squoze it myself.

1774
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,891
I hope it's
not too tangy.

1775
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:32,956
And what are you
gonna do with it?

1776
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:34,535
I'm gonna gargle
with this

1777
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,332
and say the call letters over
and over again until I get it right.

1778
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:37,633
You think
that'll work?

1779
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:40,004
I don't care, 'cause I love
the taste of a man. Ooga.

1780
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,209
All right, if I could
have some music now.

1781
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:45,246
Mr. Engineer, please,
some music.

1782
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,441
Would you, please?
Would you give us a record,

1783
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:48,448
por favor?

1784
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:51,413
OK, thank you.

1785
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,853
Now watch and learn.

1786
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,651
# La la la
la la la #

1787
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,619
There she blows.

1788
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,125
Oh. Can you believe it?

1789
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:09,602
You just swallowed.

1790
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,229
I swallowed.
Oh, my God.

1791
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,898
Waste not,
want not, Robin.

1792
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:14,237
Oh!

1793
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:18,678
I wanna say I love
W N BC.

1794
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,009
See? It worked.
I can say it.

1795
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:22,016
W N BC.

1796
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,048
- WNBC, please hold.
- WNBC, please hold.

1797
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,749
- WNBC, please hold.
- WNBC, please hold.

1798
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,758
- WNBC, please hold.
- WNBC, please hold.

1799
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:32,350
# Stop it now... #

1800
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,227
So we gave them
some characters, right?

1801
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:42,769
Get in.

1802
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:53,474
You goddamn
motherfuckers.

1803
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:55,039
You fucking waltz
in here,

1804
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,175
and you think you know
everything, don't you?

1805
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,686
Well, I fucking worked
my fucking ass off

1806
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,188
to get to
New York City,

1807
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,621
and you sure as fuck

1808
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,455
are not gonna fucking
blow it for me!

1809
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:06,459
I was just
doing character...

1810
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:07,460
Barry, Jerry,

1811
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,827
clarify the situation
for him, please.

01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,832
Page 108,

1813
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,595
"No jokes dealing
with flatulence,

1814
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,864
"excretion, urination,
ejaculation,

1815

1819
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,215
Now, from now on,
all your little bits

1820
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,648
are gonna be under
2 minutes in duration,

01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:44,559
It's time for
The Match Game.

1827
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,564
And thank you,
Mr. Announcer.

1828
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:50,502
Hi, everybody.
My name is Gene Sternburn,

1829
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,507
and welcome
to Match Game.

1830
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:55,304
We have a lot of excitement
in the air today

1831
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:57,208
because we have
some great panelists.

1832
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,213
Let me introduce you
to everybody.

1833
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:00,906
First of all, I want to
introduce all of you

1834
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,541
to a very, very charming
and beautiful lady,

1835
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:05,449
the very beautiful
Miss Brett Somers.

1836
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,452
How are you, baby?

1837
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:07,749
Hi, Gene.

1838
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:09,882
Hygiene, that's something
I don't think you have.

1839
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,459
Hey, back off.

1840
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:14,552
OK, and let's now go over
to somebody who I really admire,

1841
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:17,188
the ex-president of
the United States, Mr. Richard Nixon.

1842
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,698
Hello, everybody. Hello.

1843
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,826
I'm very, very honored
right now

1844
01:17:20,936 --> 01:17:23,905
to introduce to all of you
a very special man.

1845
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,474
He's come all the way
to our show for the first time.

1846
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:29,009
Mr. Jackie "The Jokeman"
Martling.

1847
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,772
Well, thank you, Gene.
That's very nice of you.

1848
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,437
Let's play our game now,
OK? Shall we?

1849
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:35,414
And what we're gonna do is ask you
to fill in the blank, OK?

1850
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,384
Now, I want you
to listen carefully.

1851
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,818
Our first clue up is...

1852
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,583
blank willow.

1853
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,624
Blank willow.

1854
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,684
Let's go over to
Miss Brett Somers right now.

1855
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,195
Now, Brett, what did you
have for us? Blank willow.

1856
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,732
The only thing
on my mind, Gene,

1857
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:52,765
was pussy.

1858
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,597
Uh-oh.

1859
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,365
Pussy. Hey, all right.

1860
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:57,768
Hey, that's kind of wild.

1861
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,466
Pussy willow, that's
what I would have said.

1862
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,906
All right, let's go over to Dick Nixon,
former president of the United States.

1863
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:03,410
What did you have?
Blank willow.

1864
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,002
In any language, pussy.

1865
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,978
All right!

1866
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,414
Now let's go
to our newest member

1867
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:09,711
of the panel,

1868
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:13,754
Mr. Jackie "Jokeman"
Martling. Blank willow.

1869
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,322
Well, Gene, I didn't
write it too neat,

1870
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:16,891
so I have
a sloppy pussy.

1871
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,357
Sloppy pussy!

1872
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:20,657
We had a sloppy and a fuzzy
pussy and a very big one.

1873
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,196
Are we talking
about Brett again?

1874
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,198
All right, now,
Let's keep going.

1875
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:26,166
Now it's gonna get
a little rougher, OK?

1876
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:27,531
Everybody ready?

1877
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:30,127
Blank a-doodle-doo.

1878
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:31,296
Blank a-doodle-doo.

1879
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,669
Blank a-doodle-doo.

1880
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,936
Think about that while
the celebrities are writing.

1881
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,841
Here we are. Let's go over
to our Dick Nixon,

1882
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:39,312
our own ex-president.
What do you got there, Dick?

1883
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,906
Well, it takes a Dick to know
a cock, and that's what I wrote.

1884
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:44,008
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

1885
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,450
Now, that's what
I would have said.

1886
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,078
That seemed
like the obvious answer.

1887
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,713
OK, let's go to our own
Jackie "The Jokeman" Martling.

1888
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:49,756
Jackie The Jokeman?

1889
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,918
Gene, I have cock,
and I wrote it big.

1890
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:53,358
I have a big cock.

1891
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:55,896
Uh, I don't think you can
say "big cock" on the radio.

1892
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:57,022
I think that's a no-no.

1893
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,599
But I just said pussy.

1894
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,634
Yeah, she
just said pussy.

1895
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,999
Yes, pussy is OK.
It's the way he says it.

1896
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,436
"Big cock" coming out of
your mouth sounds awfully dirty.

1897
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,440
So I can't say
"big cock,"

1898
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:08,476
but you can say "big cock
coming out of my mouth"?

1899
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,044
- That's correct.
- That sucks.

1900
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:13,512
Did you just say, "big cock
coming out of your mouth sucks"?

1901
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,641
All right,
enough of this nonsense.

1902
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,446
We gotta move
to Miss Brett Somers.

1903
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:19,816
Just like the boys,
Gene, I've got cock.

1904
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,220
There it is, cock-a-doo...
do me a favor

1905
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,383
and hold that up
so I can see your cock.

1906
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:26,791
Aw, Gene, don't
have...

1907
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:29,490
All right, there it is.
Cock, cock, cock.

1908
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,533
I must tell you, though,
we have to end this fun right now.

1909
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,432
I want to thank all of you.
Give yourselves a big hand.

1910
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:41,374
OK, let's have
a little music, Phil.

1911
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:44,503
You did not have permission
to do that bit.

1912
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,672
I never approved that script,
God damn it, Howard!

1913
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:48,739
Wait a second.
Calm down, OK, Kenny?

1914
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,215
There's a perfectly
good explanation.

1915
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,014
I'm all ears, Howard.
Let's hear it.

1916
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,714
I gave the script
to Fred.

1917
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:57,291
And I gave it to Robin over there.

1918
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,293
Oh, that's right.
I'm sorry, Kenny.

1919
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,488
I forgot to put it
in your box.

1920
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:03,086
There you go.
Perfectly good explanation.

1921
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,166
It'll never happen again,
Kenny.

1922
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,997
You're goddamn right she's never
gonna do it again. You're fired.

1923
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:09,093
What?

1924
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:11,263
Gather your things together,
Robin. Let's go.

1925
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,273
Wait a second, Kenny.
What are you talking about?

1926
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:14,933
She had nothing
to do with the bit.

1927
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:16,067
It was all me.

1928
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,406
Pack up your shit.
I'm not kidding. Let's go.

1929
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:19,707
Kenny, you can't blame
someone over one lousy bit.

1930
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,009
You can't go firing them.

1931
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:23,607
Oh, yes, I can, Howard.

1932
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:25,208
Robin, get the fuck out!

1933
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,151
#... A boy could give you #

1934
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:28,655
# Take my tears and... #

1935
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:30,088
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1936
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:31,921
If you give me
a couple of days,

1937
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,517
I know I can get you
back on the air.

1938
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:34,993
Forget it.

1939
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,758
They're trying to break us apart.
They're trying to beat us.

1940
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:38,799
That's the whole point.
You and Fred should quit,

1941
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,231
and we should go
somewhere else.

1942
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,600
Quit? If I quit,
they win.

1943
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,003
Don't you see? I don't want them to win.
I can't quit.

1944
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:46,506
- You're not gonna quit?
- No.

1945
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,270
You're gonna let 'em
throw me out like garbage?

1946
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:50,401
No. I want to beat these guys,
stomp them into the ground.

1947
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,503
The only way to do that
is to stay on the air.

1948
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:53,774
I've gotta stay
on the air, Robin.

1949
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:54,814
You're pathetic.

1950
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:56,043
I'm not pathetic.

1951
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,176
Just give me a couple of days
to make them understand.

1952
01:20:58,286 --> 01:20:59,947
I can convince these guys
to bring you back.

1953
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,080
I know I can do that.
I have that ability.

1954
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,487
Fuck you.

1955
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:04,923
They're gonna hire you back.
How can you say "fuck you"?

1956
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,090
Hey, move it,
asshole!

1957
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:09,754
She hates me. She thinks
I'm total scum.

1958
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:11,298
She thinks
I'm lower than scum.

1959
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,732
She thinks you're
letting her take the fall.

1960
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,201
Well, what do you think?

1961
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,970
I think you've been loyal
to every person you've ever worked with.

1962
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,941
That's the way you are,
you know?

1963
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,069
You'll find a way
to get her back.

1964
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,341
In fact,
I feel sorry for NBC,

1965
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:28,848
because as soon
as you start in on them,

1966
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,941
they're gonna be sorry they ever
fired her in the first place.

1967
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,952
You're right.

1968
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,352
I know.

1969
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:39,758
Howard, Fred, I'd like you
to meet your new newsman,

1970
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:41,318
Ross Buckingham.

1971
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,226
Hi. Pleasure.

1972
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,232
I'm looking forward
to joining the team.

1973
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,029
Now, old Ross here's
quite lively,

1974
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:48,227
and I think he'll
fit in well

1975
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:49,462
with your special
brand of humor.

1976
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,505
As a matter of fact,

1977
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,667
I'm a bit of
an old comedy man myself.

1978
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:57,836
I've done quite a bit
of light comedy in my younger years.

1979
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:00,471
Summer stock... mostly.

1980
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,613
Hundreds of people gathered
in Central Park this afternoon

1981
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,688
to remember former Beatle
John Lennon,

1982
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:10,452
who was murdered 2 years ago
today. Lennon's killer...

1983
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,025
Hey, let me
ask you something, Ross.

1984
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,560
Were you a Beatles fan?

1985
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:17,325
Uh... y-yes,
l... I was, once.

1986
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,866
Lennon's killer,
Mark David Chapman...

1987
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:22,927
Now, Mark David Chapman, now,
there's a guy we gotta talk about, Ross.

1988
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,903
Mark David Chapman,
what do you make of him?

1989
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,873
I mean, he's probably in a prison cell
right now enjoying himself.

1990
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:31,504
I say electrocute him. You gotta be
with that program, huh, Ross?

1991
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,513
I hope this was a good idea.

1992
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,015
Uh, I think
we're supposed

1993
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:37,779
to be having
the news now.

1994
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:39,683
Forget that.
Just repeat after me, Ross.

1995
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:41,449
I want to kill
Mark David Chapman.

1996
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,115
# 66 #

1997
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:48,093
# WNBC #

1998
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:49,858
Are we ready in there,
Freddy Boy?

1999
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:52,195
OK. We've got our next
phone call to Ross.

2000
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:53,564
Guess who's
on the phone with us.

2001
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,125
I really have no idea.

2002
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:58,000
Just take a wild guess.
Do it right off the top of your head.

2003
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,870
Um...

2004
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,670
This is a good one.
It's a good mystery guest.

2005
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:03,767
Um...

2006
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:05,812
What an ad-libber, Ross.

2007
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,848
All right, I don't want to
put you under too much pressure.

2008
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,246
Hi. Is this
Betty Jean Rushton?

2009
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,284
Yes, it is.

2010
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:11,944
Betty Jean, hi.
It's Howard Stern,

2011
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:12,951
W N BC.

2012
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:14,578
I work with
your husband Kenny.

2013
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:16,520
Yes. Kenny's
mentioned you.

2014
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:17,888
Oh, I bet Kenny has.

2015
01:23:17,959 --> 01:23:20,655
The reason I'm calling
is because your husband

2016
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:22,889
has been very bitchy
around here lately,

2017
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:26,058
and I'm thinking that maybe
if you gave him some more sex...

2018
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,566
More sex?

2019
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:30,103
Yeah. He's backed up.
Isn't he backed up, Ross?

2020
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,299
Yes. You know, you might
be right about that, Howard.

2021
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:34,807
Oh, really?
I am right.

2022
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:36,378
Howard!

2023
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,240
You ever do that again,
I'll kill you.

2024
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,474
I need Robin.
She's the anchor on the show.

2025
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:41,606
That's
what's missing.

2026
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:42,980
You have violated
my wife.

2027
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:43,983
I did not.

2028
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,213
You soiled the sanctity
of my home!

2029
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:47,845
What are you saying?
I didn't do anything.

2030
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,150
I wouldn't even be
doing bits like that

2031
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:50,657
if Robin was with me.

2032
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:52,590
I never would have even
called his wife on the air

2033
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,592
if I had Robin
sitting there.

2034
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:54,889
She's the voice
of reason.

2035
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:57,898
You know what?
You know what you are, Stern?

2036
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,399
You're the Antichrist.

2037
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:00,934
- What?
- Yes, that's what you are!

2038
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:03,994
You are the motherfucking
Antichrist!

2039
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:06,302
Kenny, take it easy.

2040
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:16,406
Well, this is an exciting day
for us here in the studio

2041
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:17,883
because we have a stage star
with us.

2042
01:24:17,952 --> 01:24:19,852
This is Donna Porter
with us on the show,

2043
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:22,788
and she's here to talk
about life in the theater,

2044
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:24,415
and, Donna, I don't know
if you know this,

2045
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,585
but our own news guy
Ross Buckingham

2046
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,323
actually has some theater experience
as well, don't you, Ross?

2047
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:32,093
Do you want to tell us
about that?

2048
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,000
Yes. Um... I once did
some summer stock.

2049
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,332
I know you're very,
very proud

2050
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,871
of your summer stock
experience.

2051
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,270
When you went on stage
the very first time,

2052
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,307
did you ever
get nervous?

2053
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:44,368
No, I was...
quite comfortable.

2054
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,107
I see.
That's very interesting.

2055
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,614
Then, in 1926,

2056
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:50,845
General Sarnoff
formed NBC radio,

2057
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,546
America's first network.

2058
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,646
I guess you could say
I was a little nervous

2059
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:58,851
the first time I was ever
on stage with a 12-inch kielbasa.

2060
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,394
Now, why is that?

2061
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:02,054
Can I show you?

2062
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,624
Sure. I think we'd like
to see what you have.

2063
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,168
Right now, you're getting
a look at a live broadcast

2064
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,294
of The Howard Stern
Show.

2065
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:10,530
That's about 13 inches,

2066
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,664
and you're licking
whipped cream off a kielbasa,

2067
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:13,866
and you're putting it
in your mouth,

2068
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,705
and you're jamming
the kielbasa

2069
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,244
all the way down
your throat.

2070
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:18,574
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

2071
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,240
The entire kielbasa
is going down.

2072
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,251
She has swallowed an entire
13-inch kielbasa.

2073
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:27,811
Look at that.
A full 13 inches, ladies and gentlemen.

2074
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:30,221
Wow. You gotta
love that, folks.

2075
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,851
You gotta love it,
don't you, Ross? Ho ho.

2076
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,895
Ross Buckingham,
have you ever seen a woman

2077
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,931
swallow
an entire 13-inch kielbasa?

2078
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:38,090
When you were
in the theater,

2079
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,359
did you ever work
with a kielbasa?

2080
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:40,924
What he did to me today

2081
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:45,462
was the most unprofessional
and insulting experience of my life.

2082
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,839
I hold you and this station
personally responsible.

2083
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:51,174
If you want to fire me,
fire me. Go ahead.

2084
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:54,215
But I refuse to work with
this man one minute longer.

2085
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:57,710
Good day.

2086
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:02,585
OK, it's 5:35 at W N BC.

2087
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:03,624
Time for the news.

2088
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,283
I'm not real good
at this, I confess,

2089
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,555
but I'm trying...

2090
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:09,597
Who the fuck
are we gonna get?

2091
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,531
Beats me. No one wants
to work with him.

2092
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,830
Is it Monaco or Mon aco?

2093
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:17,801
Monaco?

2094
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:19,863
That's what I thought.
Monaco.

2095
01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,238
Well, anyway, she's dead.

2096
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,901
You know,
I'm thinking about...

2097
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:24,774
What about Kelly Landers?

2098
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,905
Absolutely refuses.

2099
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:27,913
Says she'd rather quit.

2100
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:29,745
I have a theory
that he is the one

2101
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,341
who cut the brakes
on the car.

2102
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,887
Now, I could be crazy, but I figure
a guy who's been married

2103
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,856
as long as Prince Reindeer
is ready for a new wife.

2104
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,916
I mean, Princess Grace...
beautiful woman and all that...

2105
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,688
but she was losing
her looks. Let's be honest.

2106
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:41,888
There were bags
under those eyes.

2107
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:43,396
In other news,

2108
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:46,126
One of Italy's
highest-ranking police officials,

2109
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,169
General Alberto DeCarlo...

2110
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:52,730
Kenny, we're one of the biggest
radio stations in America.

2111
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,536
We can't just
not do the news.

2112
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:56,236
My program director
Pig Vomit

2113
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:59,508
gets assassinated
by Sicilians in Palermo.

2114
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,014
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

2115
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:02,845
I want to pray to God
right now.

2116
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,544
Jesus Christ,
who I love so much,

2117
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:06,052
more than anything
in the whole world,

2118
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,179
I am begging you,
please...

2119
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:10,781
send a hit man to
the United States of America

2120
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:12,416
to kill Pig Vomit finally.

2121
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:13,790
Thank you. I love you, God.

2122
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:15,761
I'll do whatever you say
if you just make that come true.

2123
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:20,192
# Howard Stern, WNBC #

2124
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:23,995
So if we bring Robin back,
you'll behave?

2125
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,302
Absolutely.
Robin's my anchor.

2126
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,568
You can't trust him.

2127
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:28,734
Kenny,
that's not fair.

2128
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:32,143
And quite frankly,
I'm just a little bit hurt

2129
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:35,307
that you're so incapable
of being supportive.

2130
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:39,285
And, Vin, please, if
you hire Robin back,

2131
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:40,946
I promise you
you won't be sorry.

2132
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,489
You have my word.

2133
01:27:50,798 --> 01:27:51,730
Thank you.

2134
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:57,295
We hate noise.
Isn't that right, Jerry?

2135
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,805
Yeah. Makes me nuts.

2136
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:00,306
No, it's
a very quiet street.

2137
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:01,842
You're gonna like it here.

2138
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:04,441
Excuse me for a second.

2139
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,110
You're back.
I got you back.

2140
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:08,239
It's a miracle
of all miracles.

2141
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:09,611
I can't talk right now.

2142
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:11,242
Oh, hello.
How are you?

2143
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:13,344
I even got you an office.
You're all set.

2144
01:28:13,421 --> 01:28:14,820
I'm showing
my apartment now.

2145
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,356
You're looking
at this apartment?

2146
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:18,085
Let me tell you something.
There are roaches the size of dogs here.

2147
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,592
- I don't advise you living here.
- Excuse me.

2148
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:21,754
It is disgusting.
Take a look behind the fireplace.

2149
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,888
You'll see. Excuse me.
I'll come back and tell you.

2150
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,092
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

2151
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,032
Robin, you got your job back,
so what's the problem?

2152
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:30,127
The problem is that
when I needed you,

2153
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:31,364
you didn't stand
behind me.

2154
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,066
Robin, those guys are assholes.
They screwed you,

2155
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,405
and they screwed me. We gotta
get back in there and beat them.

2156
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,137
We were supposed
to be a team.

2157
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:38,542
We are a team,
for God's sakes.

2158
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:40,103
We're gonna be the greatest team
in the history of radio.

2159
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:42,780
Come on.
What's the big deal?

2160
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:46,149
Look at me, Robin.
Robin...

2161
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,152
See this?

2162
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:48,483
Look what I'm doing.

2163
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:49,716
You know what I'm doing?
I'm begging you.

2164
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:51,258
I'm begging you.

2165
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,793
I'm serious.

2166
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,225
Come here.
I'm gonna kiss your feet.

2167
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:55,353
Look at these gams.

2168
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,624
Look at these feet.

2169
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:58,393
I'm worshipping your foot.

2170
01:28:58,466 --> 01:28:59,728
Look at me, Robin.

2171
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,166
What are you doing?

2172
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,361
People are looking
at us.

2173
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:04,530
I'm begging you to...
I'm liking it down here.

2174
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:06,436
Hey, Robin,

2175
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:08,668
you love this,
don't you?

2176
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:09,937
It gives me
great pleasure now

2177
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,239
to welcome back
on our show

2178
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:13,746
the very beautiful,
multitalented...

2179
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:16,079
uh, vivacious...

2180
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:17,811
tight-sweatered...

2181
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:20,979
beautifully big-breasted
Robin Quivers. I love her.

2182
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,750
Thank you.

2183
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:25,019
May I say that you are
beautifully big-breasted again?

2184
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:26,424
No.

2185
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:28,928
Thank God you're back,
'cause the show sucked without you.

2186
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,396
Actually, I just want to say
how much I really missed you and...

2187
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:32,398
Aww.

2188
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:33,593
That I really do love you,

2189
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:35,329
and I'm just
so glad you're back.

2190
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:37,701
OK there, Mr. Rushton,

2191
01:29:37,772 --> 01:29:41,640
You pick up the phone,
and it rings right into my booth.

2192
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,267
Good, but don't
answer it.

2193
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:46,040
Immediately disconnect
Stern's microphone,

2194
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:48,241
dump out of the delay,
and go straight to a record.

2195
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:49,442
That would be it,
sir.

2196
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:52,611
Always have a record
ready to go.

2197
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:54,177
Yes, sir.

2198
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:59,922
This little puppy's finally
gonna get housebroken.

2199
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,222
Oh, look at this, Robin.
This is unbelievable.

2200
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:03,991
Oh, the underpants
are coming off.

2201
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:07,330
That is the first naked lady
in the history of radio.

2202
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:08,960
Sans panties, sans bra.

2203
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,469
I am shocked.

2204
01:30:10,538 --> 01:30:11,971
So am I.
This is disgraceful.

2205
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:13,063
We should be taken
off the air.

2206
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:15,074
You've finally done it.

2207
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:17,270
Ohh! Beautiful. You're a work of art.
Did you know that?

2208
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:18,277
Thank you, Howard.

2209
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:19,472
Let me tell you
something.

2210
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:21,845
Now, to ensure our place
in the history of radio,

2211
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,544
Mandy has agreed to actually
get on the floor with me

2212
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:26,177
and give me a massage
while she is nude.

2213
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,779
What does a massage have to do
with making it into history?

2214
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,790
Who knows? I don't know.
Massage, schmas.

2215
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:31,790
I just gotta
get touched.

2216
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:32,951
I can't wait, Howard.

2217
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:33,994
You can't wait?

2218
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,153
Let me tell you something...

2219
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:37,493
I'm not kidding around...
You are beautiful,

2220
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:38,998
and my thoughts
are right in the gutter.

2221
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:40,363
You understand what I mean?

2222
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:41,595
This is the Tudor,
right?

2223
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:43,500
Center hall plan,
very traditional.

2224
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:44,765
I've been
thinking about you, too.

2225
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:48,036
Only reason it's for sale
is they're divorcing.

2226
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:51,943
Would you believe 80%% %
of my listings are from divorces?

2227
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,207
Mmm.
For God's sakes.

2228
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,646
Now, what do you suggest
we do here?

2229
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:58,378
Why don't you come lay
over here and get comfortable?

2230
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,216
I could do that.

2231
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,220
All right.

2232
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,654
I can't believe
my luck here.

2233
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,315
Don't hurt yourself
getting over there.

2234
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:05,324
I won't.

2235
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:06,519
All right,
hold on a second.

2236
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,188
Let me get
my cans on.

2237
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:10,195
OK.

2238
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:12,095
Ooh, you know what?
You know... Oh, man.

2239
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,098
Let me soak you in.

2240
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:14,361
Holy cow,
are you naked.

2241
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:15,595
You know what I like
about you?

2242
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:16,602
What?

2243
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:17,695
I like that you're
the perfect height.

2244
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:18,704
I could have sex
with you standing up.

2245
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:20,400
Look at that. Ooh.

2246
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:23,171
Howard! You're married.

2247
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:24,768
I am? I mean, I am.

2248
01:31:24,846 --> 01:31:26,108
Well, I'm not really
married anymore.

2249
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:27,147
What do you mean?

2250
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:28,579
Take a seat. I'll
Tell you what happened.

2251
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:30,810
My wife was suffering from cancer...
I never told you this...

2252
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:31,817
and she died last night.

2253
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:33,376
I've been single
for exactly 6 hours.

2254
01:31:33,454 --> 01:31:35,251
Honey, if you're
up there now,

2255
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,257
I know you can hear me,
and you're at God's side,

2256
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,589
but I want you to cover
your ears and eyes.

2257
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,150
Besides, you're married
to God now...

2258
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,196
Your husband's
quite a character.

2259
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:46,825
Only on the radio.
It's just an act.

2260
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:49,836
Oh, oh, that's nice. No one's ever
touched me like this before.

2261
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:50,871
Let me ask you
something.

2262
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:52,064
You have the look
of love in your eyes,

2263
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,334
but I'm an ugly man.
I know this.

2264
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,171
You couldn't be physically
attracted to me, could you?

2265
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:57,802
Physically, I am.

2266
01:31:57,879 --> 01:32:00,245
I mean, you're smart,
you're sexy.

2267
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,282
Wait. Excuse me
for one minute. Robin...

2268
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,476
I didn't say a thing.

2269
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:06,553
Robin, go up to the cafeteria
and get some lunch.

2270
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:07,849
Yeah, go ahead.
Tell me more about me.

2271
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:08,946
You're funny.

2272
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,787
You know what I would
do to you physically?

2273
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,156
What would you do?

2274
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,195
I don't know what I'd do,
but let me just say something.

2275
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:17,264
Whatever it is,
it would last 3 seconds.

2276
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,764
3 seconds,
I'd be finished.

2277
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:21,802
We would have sex, like,
10 times a day. You would love it.

2278
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,064
I kind of want to
wrap my legs around you.

2279
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:25,070
You do?

2280
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:31,036
The average radio listener
listens for 18 minutes.

2281
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:32,079
Mm-hmm.

2282
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:34,113
The average Howard Stern fan
listens for...

2283
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:35,409
are you ready for this?

2284
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:37,314
An hour and 20 minutes.

2285
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:38,511
How can that be?

2286
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:40,019
Answer

2287
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:42,521
"I want to see
what he'll say next."

2288
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,023
All right, OK, fine.

2289
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:46,150
But what about the people
who hate Stern?

2290
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,218
Good point.
The average Stern hater...

2291
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:51,162
listens for
21/2 hours a day.

2292
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,969
Look, but if they hate him,

2293
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:57,368
why do they listen?

2294
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,439
"I want to see
what he'll say next."

2295
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:02,339
- Kenny.
- Fucking twisted. What?

2296
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,537
You'd better listen to this.

2297
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:06,112
This is nice.
You wanna know something?

2298
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,613
This is
the God's honest truth.

2299
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:09,081
Come here.
I want to tell you closer.

2300
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:12,551
I am fully aroused right now.
I am totally engorged.

2301
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:13,517
Oh, my God.

2302
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:14,816
Well, after the show,

2303
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:17,722
why don't we go someplace else
and see how it feels?

2304
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:19,259
Really? That's great.

2305
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,827
You know why I love you?
'Cause you're smart.

2306
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,158
And you're practically a virgin, right?

2307
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:24,891
Practically.

2308
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:27,696
You have a sharp ass.

2309
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,668
I'm gonna be so honest
with you now.

2310
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:31,364
I've never said this before.

2311
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,168
I'm telling you,
I'm a full 21/2 inches,

2312
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,367
and I've never been 21/2...
What's the music?

2313
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:36,671
We're off the air.

2314
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:38,678
Are we off the air?

2315
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:42,113
Oh. Would you do me a favor?
Just stay right there, OK?

2316
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:43,980
What the hell's going on?
What are you doing, man?

2317
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,643
Look, Rushton told me,
this phone...

2318
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,518
Oh, come on, man.
Don't listen to Kenny.

2319
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:49,851
I'm just doing what
he told me, that's all.

2320
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,357
Shit, man, you don't
take me off the air

2321
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:52,392
in the middle
of a fucking bit.

2322
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,484
Come on.
Don't listen to Kenny.

2323
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:54,585
You're supposed
to listen to me.

2324
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:55,719
He's the boss.

2325
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,560
Forget it.
You believe this?

2326
01:33:58,599 --> 01:33:59,861
What the hell
are they doing?

2327
01:34:02,003 --> 01:34:03,095
Yeah, hi.
Can I speak to Kenny?

2328
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:05,138
It's Howard over
in the air studio.

2329
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:06,206
Just hold the line.

2330
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:07,296
As soon
as they get him on,

2331
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:08,340
just keep him on the line.

2332
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:09,740
Fred, get me back
on the air.

2333
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,005
Just patch the phone call
onto the air, OK?

2334
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,479
Just put it right through
as soon as you can.

2335
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:15,708
Fuck, man.

2336
01:34:15,783 --> 01:34:19,184
# Oh, the canvas
can do miracles #

2337
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:20,311
# Just you wait and see... #

2338
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:22,049
Patch it in.

2339
01:34:22,123 --> 01:34:23,590
I said patch it in!

2340
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:29,589
Yes, Robin, he's
running in right now.

2341
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,757
Can I have the phone, please,
just for a second?

2342
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,356
Hi, Robin.
We back on the air?

2343
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:34,627
Yeah.
Everybody can hear.

2344
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:36,192
OK, I'm right outside
Pig Vomit's office.

2345
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:37,395
I'm gonna knock
on his door.

2346
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:38,403
All right.

2347
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:39,905
Hey, Pig Vomit.

2348
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,805
Come on, Kenny.
Why don't you open up?

2349
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:44,208
I want to know why
this guy had to cut my show off.

2350
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:45,438
Come on, Pig Vomit.

2351
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,707
Mr. Stern,
he's in a meeting.

2352
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:47,873
I'd like to know
what meeting

2353
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:49,108
is more important
than my show.

2354
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,480
He took the show
right off the air.

2355
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:52,849
What'd you take the show
off the air for, Pig Vomit? Huh?

2356
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,512
This isn't funny, Howard.

2357
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:55,520
Oh, it's not funny?

2358
01:34:55,589 --> 01:34:56,920
What are you
talking about?

2359
01:34:56,991 --> 01:34:58,015
I think
it's very funny.

2360
01:34:58,092 --> 01:34:59,081
How would you know
what's funny, anyway?

2361
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,320
You're not bringing
that in here, Stern.

2362
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:03,022
I don't see anybody
in here in a meeting, do you?

2363
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:04,029
You gotta go.

2364
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:05,030
Why would I have to go?

2365
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:06,657
Why don't you explain
to my audience

2366
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:07,734
why you had to
shut down the show?

2367
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:09,325
I don't answer
to you, Stern.

2368
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:11,132
Yes, you do,
you big idiot scumbag.

2369
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,332
I'm your boss.
I'm your boss.

2370
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:14,396
Hey, what's this?

2371
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:17,204
Robin, it's everybody's
salary on his desk.

2372
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:18,540
God damn it,
get out of here!

2373
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:20,273
He hit me, Robin.
He's hitting me.

2374
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:21,279
Hit him back.

2375
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,248
I'm gonna
hit you back.

2376
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:25,114
I hit him back.
He hit...

2377
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:26,585
You're not getting
the phone from me, Kenny.

2378
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:27,586
Gimme the damn phone.

2379
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:28,622
No!

2380
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:29,621
Oh!

2381
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,884
Oh, my God, Robin.

2382
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:33,119
Kenny just hit himself
in the face. He's bleeding.

2383
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:34,161
Give that to me.

2384
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:35,593
Hey, come on.

2385
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:36,630
Oh!

2386
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:38,187
Oh, goodness,
what's going on?

2387
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:39,596
Vince just got hit
by Kenny.

2388
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:40,793
God damn it, Stern!

2389
01:35:40,868 --> 01:35:43,200
You look! See that?!
Blood, Stern!

2390
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:44,965
- Are you OK?
- No!

2391
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:45,971
Broke my nose!

2392
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,302
It wasn't my fault.

2393
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:48,398
I'll sue your ass!

2394
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:49,476
Get out of here!

2395
01:35:51,412 --> 01:35:52,379
Our first guest tonight

2396
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:55,006
is the afternoon
drive-time disc jockey

2397
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:57,642
at WNBC radio
here in New York City.

2398
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:58,844
Ladies and gentlemen,
do me a favor.

2399
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:01,410
Please welcome Howard Stern.

2400
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:02,454
Howard!

2401
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,826
Walk over there
and have a seat.

2402
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:15,300
Now, uh, Howard,
you know, uh...

2403
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:17,200
I admire you, you know?
I love what you do.

2404
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,465
I think
you're a pioneer.

2405
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:20,200
You're on the cutting edge
of radio entertainment.

2406
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:22,606
You and I both work
for NBC.

2407
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:23,643
You have
the radio show,

2408
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:25,336
I have the little
TV show here.

2409
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:27,209
How do you get along
with the folks here?

2410
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:28,373
You enjoying
the experience?

2411
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:29,848
I hate it at NBC, Dave.

2412
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:32,249
It's the worst. It sucks.
I gotta tell you something.

2413
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:33,616
All the management at NBC...

2414
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:36,281
bunch of creeps, and I'm not
afraid to say it right now,

2415
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:38,018
and, you know,
it's funny,

2416
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:40,652
because I know you feel
the same exact way I do about NBC

2417
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:42,593
because you told me on the phone
personally last week

2418
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:43,630
that you feel
the same way.

2419
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:45,892
I couldn't be happier.
Everything is fine.

2420
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:47,365
I don't understand
them at all.

2421
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:49,664
Now, Howard, let's get
back to the issue
of them being creepy.

2422
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:51,227
Now, when you say
they're creep...

2423
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:55,241
He makes us sound like
a bunch of idiots on the radio.

2424
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:57,243
He criticizes us
on television.

2425
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:59,541
I thought you were going
to control this guy.

2426
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:01,444
Oh, well,
we are, sir.

2427
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:04,780
In fact, we're designing
a more restrictive program

2428
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:06,114
- Shut up.
- To make sure...

2429
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:07,654
How are his numbers?

2430
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:10,656
The official ratings don't
come out until tomorrow,

2431
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:11,959
but we've got
some projections.

2432
01:37:14,395 --> 01:37:17,489
Stern... has gone...

2433
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:21,501
from a 2.9 to a 5.6.

2434
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:27,631
He's number one
in the market.

2435
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:29,300
He's the hottest d.j.
In New York.

2436
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:33,278
Kind of weird,
you know?

2437
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,178
I thought there was
a mistake or something,

2438
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:38,878
but...
mm-mmm... no.

2439
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:42,821
My girlfriends think i'm crazy for
letting you behave like that on the air.

2440
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:44,824
What are you
talking about?

2441
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:46,325
You know what it is?
It's those yentas you hang around with.

2442
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:47,826
They're... they're
driving you crazy.

2443
01:37:47,895 --> 01:37:49,522
It's not yentas, Howard.
It's everybody.

2444
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:51,531
I can't even go... I can't
even get my hair done.

2445
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,089
I can't even walk in
and get my hair done

2446
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,499
without people looking at me like,
"Oh, God, that poor little thing."

2447
01:37:55,569 --> 01:37:56,763
Then you know
what you gotta do?

2448
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:57,861
You gotta go to a different
hair shop or something.

2449
01:37:57,938 --> 01:37:59,337
- Please!
- For God's sakes,

2450
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:00,930
If the place is driving
you crazy, don't go there.

2451
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:02,441
It's not that!
It's not that!

2452
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:03,669
God, no wonder they think
you're sleeping around!

2453
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:04,904
Look at me!
Look at me!

2454
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:06,446
- I'm disgusting!
- What about you?

2455
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:09,175
- You're not disgusting.
- Yes, I am! I look like a house!

2456
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,979
- I look like an elephant!
- You don't look like a house.

2457
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,746
- You do not. You look beautiful.
- I look like Babar!

2458
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:14,412
- You don't look like an elephant.
- I do.

2459
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:16,922
You don't look like Babar.
You look gorgeous.

2460
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,356
This is the most beautiful
you ever looked.

2461
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:19,619
You're carrying our baby.

2462
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:22,025
Come over here. You want to
sit down on this couch?

2463
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:24,030
You know what the problem is?
You're tired.

2464
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:25,224
I am tired.

2465
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:26,357
Here.

2466
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,536
Look at this...

2467
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:35,199
It's our baby.

2468
01:38:36,777 --> 01:38:38,244
It's beautiful.

2469
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:40,177
You're beautiful.

2470
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:42,010
Beautiful.

2471
01:38:47,454 --> 01:38:48,386
Who would come here?

2472
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:49,513
Quiet.

2473
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:55,484
I don't want
to get that.

2474
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:57,086
Oh.

2475
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:58,597
OK. I'll go
get the door.

2476
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:01,032
Don't go away.

2477
01:39:06,407 --> 01:39:07,339
Howdy, partner.

2478
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:08,670
- How you doing?
- Oh, hey, Kenny.

2479
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:10,232
Can I come in
just for a second?

2480
01:39:10,311 --> 01:39:11,437
It's kind of
a bad time, OK?

2481
01:39:11,512 --> 01:39:13,412
Just real quick, OK?
Listen.

2482
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,708
I want to tell you
something.

2483
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,249
You've won.

2484
01:39:16,317 --> 01:39:17,875
When the new ratings
come out tomorrow,

2485
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,613
you are going
to be number one.

2486
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:22,315
You understand me? A point
and a half higher than lmus.

2487
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:24,016
- No shit?
- You've killed him. You've slayed him.

2488
01:39:24,091 --> 01:39:25,183
You understand me?
Ha ha!

2489
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:26,248
That's great news.
Thanks, Kenny. I gotta go.

2490
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:27,555
Howard!
Howard! Howard!

2491
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:31,530
Listen, I know I've been
a real pain in the butt, OK?

2492
01:39:31,598 --> 01:39:32,997
But that's
all over with now.

2493
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:35,001
Now, you're going to need
a friend on the inside.

2494
01:39:35,069 --> 01:39:36,730
I'm going to do
everything I can for you.

2495
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:39,705
All right?
How's that sound, partner?

2496
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,307
Fuck you.

2497
01:39:44,712 --> 01:39:46,543
People of New York...

2498
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:48,410
People of Earth...

2499
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:50,074
we are gathered here today

2500
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:51,674
in praise of me!

2501
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:57,686
Man, this is
a great day in my life.

2502
01:39:57,758 --> 01:40:00,158
I've been dreaming
of this day forever.

2503
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:01,785
Thank you!

2504
01:40:01,862 --> 01:40:03,955
Thanks.

2505
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:06,124
You know,
when I got to NBC,

2506
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,225
they treated me
like I was a jerk.

2507
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:11,703
They did everything to
sabotage me, but because of you...

2508
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:15,798
Because of you,
and only because of you,

2509
01:40:15,876 --> 01:40:18,276
I am now the number one
disc jockey in New York,

2510
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:20,040
and I thank you.
I love you for that.

2511
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:21,046
I love you!

2512
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:23,982
Thank you!

2513
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:25,643
This is my gift to you,
New York...

2514
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:27,550
AC/DC!

2515
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:46,904
# She was a fast machine #

2516
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:49,238
# She kept
her motor clean #

2517
01:40:49,309 --> 01:40:52,574
# She was the best damn
woman that I've ever seen #

2518
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:54,876
# She had the sexiest eyes #

2519
01:40:54,948 --> 01:40:56,415
# Telling me no lies #

2520
01:40:56,483 --> 01:41:00,351
# Knockin' me out
with those American thighs #

2521
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:02,048
# We did not
want to share... #

2522
01:41:02,122 --> 01:41:04,818
How!
My water broke!

2523
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:05,824
What?

2524
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:08,020
My water broke!

2525
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:10,188
# Bang, the walls
started shakin' #

2526
01:41:10,264 --> 01:41:12,198
# The earth was quakin' #

2527
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:14,291
# My mind was achin' #

2528
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,427
# We were makin' when you #

2529
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:20,132
# Shook me all night long #

2530
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:23,108
Hey! Hey!

2531
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:28,205
# Yeah, you shook me
all night long... #

2532
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:31,045
Keep it moving!

2533
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:33,780
# One more time,
and when she got to... #

2534
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:47,432
Hoowww!

2535
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:48,468
Now, push! Push!

2536
01:41:48,535 --> 01:41:50,935
No, no, don't push.
Just breathe deeply.

2537
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:51,936
Don't push, honey.

2538
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:52,937
Ice chips.

2539
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:54,337
Fuck ice chips,
How!

2540
01:41:54,408 --> 01:41:56,273
Listen to me...

2541
01:41:56,577 --> 01:41:59,375
we named her Emily.
7 pounds, 8 ounces.

2542
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:01,744
She was incredibly
beautiful. Really nice.

2543
01:42:01,815 --> 01:42:03,112
Well, you must
have felt fabulous.

2544
01:42:03,183 --> 01:42:05,913
Yeah, I had everything I ever
wanted in life, you know.

2545
01:42:05,986 --> 01:42:07,010
You know,
I have to admit

2546
01:42:07,087 --> 01:42:09,885
that I'm really not
a very big fan of yours,

2547
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,322
but, in fact, l...

2548
01:42:11,391 --> 01:42:14,224
I know. You thought I was
a disgusting, sexist, racist pig

2549
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:17,161
who had the maturity level
of a 3-year-old, right?

2550
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:18,255
Yeah, exactly.

2551
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:19,959
Yeah. I get that
all the time.

2552
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:22,331
But then you know
what happens?

2553
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:23,426
What?

2554
01:42:23,504 --> 01:42:25,563
I grow on you
like a fungus.

2555
01:42:27,741 --> 01:42:29,140
I could see that.

2556
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:35,214
You know, I have
to tell you...

2557
01:42:35,282 --> 01:42:37,910
this has been
a really great flight.

2558
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:39,612
Really?

2559
01:42:39,686 --> 01:42:41,085
Mm-hmm.

2560
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,324
You know, I could
get this girl.

2561
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:46,552
I know I could get her.

2562
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:48,561
And this is the hell
that's my life.

2563
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:50,062
I mean, think about it.

2564
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:51,757
What would it be like
to have sex with her?

2565
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,163
It would be amazing.

2566
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:55,463
But I'm not going
to act on it.

2567
01:42:55,536 --> 01:42:57,026
You know why?

2568
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,435
Because I'd be a schmuck.

2569
01:42:58,505 --> 01:43:00,769
No, because
I love Alison.

2570
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:04,299
She stuck with me through
the whole thing, you know?

2571
01:43:04,378 --> 01:43:06,175
You gotta respect that.

2572
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:08,510
I think you have
to respect that.

2573
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,352
You have to
respect that.

2574
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,192
Hey, everybody!

2575
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:22,523
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

2576
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:24,223
Oh, did I miss you!

2577
01:43:24,298 --> 01:43:26,926
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

2578
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,025
Let's go say hi to Mommy.
Come on.

2579
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:30,535
- Hi.
- Wait, wait. There we go.

2580
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:31,798
Did you miss me?
Mmm!

2581
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:33,806
Hi, honey.
I missed you.

2582
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:34,806
Oh, Gloria.

2583
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,176
Honey, Gloria.
Gloria, honey.

2584
01:43:36,176 --> 01:43:36,938
Honey, Gloria.
Gloria, honey.

2585
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:38,068
- Hi.
- Hi.

2586
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:39,737
Maybe the two of you
would like to have

2587
01:43:39,813 --> 01:43:41,713
a little menage a trois
tonight?

2588
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:43,340
Huh. You know what?
Maybe some other time.

2589
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:44,349
Just, you know,
trying.

2590
01:43:44,418 --> 01:43:45,350
Yeah, I know.

2591
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:46,977
OK. See you,
Gloria.

2592
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:49,887
So occasionally I make
a fool of myself in public,

2593
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:51,857
and the FCC
wants me off the air,

2594
01:43:51,925 --> 01:43:54,917
and every fundamentalist group
in this country hates my guts,

2595
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:58,431
and, yeah, most of the things
I do are misunderstood.

2596
01:43:58,498 --> 01:44:00,432
Hey, after all,
being misunderstood

2597
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,934
is the fate of all
true geniuses, is it not?

2598
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:04,698
But my life
isn't bad at all.

2599
01:44:04,771 --> 01:44:06,705
I'm still on the air,

2600
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:08,434
I've got my kids,

2601
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:09,941
and I've got Alison.

2602
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:12,774
Alison... She's the best friend
I could ever have.

2603
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:13,938
And who knows?

2604
01:44:14,014 --> 01:44:15,447
With a little time,

2605
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:16,948
the right energy...

2606
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:19,645
I think I could talk her
into some hot lesbo action.

2607
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,052
# Got my hands into something #

2608
01:44:23,123 --> 01:44:25,216
# I could not touch... #

2609
01:44:25,292 --> 01:44:27,453
Wait! Wait! Is that it?

2610
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:28,551
What, the movie's over?

2611
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:29,755
Oh, yeah?
That's bullshit!

2612
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:32,424
Hi. You know who I am?
Yeah, I'm Stuttering John.

2613
01:44:32,499 --> 01:44:33,898
And you know why I'm pissed?
I'll tell you why.

2614
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,492
I've been getting up at 5:00
every morning to work for Howard.

2615
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:38,003
I've been pissing off
every publicist,

2616
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:39,732
burning every freakin'
bridge in the industry,

2617
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:43,242
And y-y-you'd figure Howard would pay
me back by putting me in his movie!

2618
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:44,833
No, he doesn't!
I'm not in the movie!

2619
01:44:44,911 --> 01:44:47,004
I've been in here for 8 years,
cuttin' his friggin' potato!

2620
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:49,173
I've been smacked around
by Morton Downey,

2621
01:44:49,249 --> 01:44:51,183
punched in the nose by Raquel Welch,
and what do I get?

2622
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:52,650
I get fucking nothing!
That's what I get!

2623
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:53,777
I'm not even in
this fucking movie!

2624
01:44:53,854 --> 01:44:54,912
He's says I'll
be in the sequel!

2625
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:56,717
Yeah? What sequel?
Suppose the movie sucks?

2626
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,621
Th-th-th-there won't
even be any sequel!

2627
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:02,150
# If you lie for your breakfast,
then you won't get lunch #

2628
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:05,995
# I'm a hard charger #

2629
01:45:06,066 --> 01:45:07,966
# I don't believe in dying #

2630
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:10,128
# No such luck #

2631
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:13,798
# Hard charger #

2632
01:45:13,874 --> 01:45:17,571
# Can't stay pretty
'cause it's just no fun #

2633
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:20,169
# Hard charger... #

2634
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:24,683
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mia Farrow.

2635
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,048
Thank you.

2636
01:45:28,121 --> 01:45:29,053
Thank you.

2637
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:33,525
The nominees
for best actor are...

2638
01:45:33,593 --> 01:45:35,026

2639

Howard Stern.

2643
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:56,038
And the winner is...

2644
01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:57,048
Howard Stern.

2645
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:05,681
It's me!

2646
01:46:18,472 --> 01:46:20,269
# I'm a radio star #

2647
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,467
# A hit on TV #

2648
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:24,339
# My life is on film #

2649
01:46:24,444 --> 01:46:26,344
# Yet it sucks bein' me #

2650
01:46:26,446 --> 01:46:27,970
Shut up! Sit down!

2651
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:29,948
# My life's a wreck #

2652
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,246
# I'm bored with sex #

2653
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:36,847
# I've got a big nose
and a skinny neck #

2654
01:46:36,923 --> 01:46:38,982
# I can't sing #

2655
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:40,993
# I can't dance #

2656
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:44,656
# I make money talking about
the joke in my underpants #

2657
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:46,358
# I'm a tortured man #

2658
01:46:46,433 --> 01:46:47,365
Shut up! Sit down!

2659
01:46:47,434 --> 01:46:48,628
# I'm a tortured man #

2660
01:46:48,702 --> 01:46:50,363
I told you not to be
stupid, you moron.

2661
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:51,732
I'm just
thinking for a minute.

2662
01:46:51,805 --> 01:46:54,638
Should I trade half my money
for 10 times as much sex?

2663
01:46:54,708 --> 01:46:56,073
It's an equation
from hell.

2664
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:57,075
Oh, well!

2665
01:46:57,144 --> 01:46:58,270
It's an equation
from hell.

2666
01:46:58,345 --> 01:46:59,277
Oh, well!

2667
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:00,506
It's an equation
from hell.

2668
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:01,945
Oh, well!

2669
01:47:02,015 --> 01:47:05,576
# Your mouth is like a suicide #

2670
01:47:05,652 --> 01:47:08,382
# Talkin' like
you never doubt #

2671
01:47:08,488 --> 01:47:10,319
# Melting me down #

2672
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:14,087
# And suck, suck,
sucking my brain #

2673
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:19,895
# But I can't be the one
that you need, yeah #

2674
01:47:19,966 --> 01:47:21,297
# And I can't be the... #

2675
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:24,166
I bear no grudge
against Howard Stern.

2676
01:47:24,237 --> 01:47:27,001
He's been very successful,
and God bless him.

2677
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:28,506
God bless him.

2678
01:47:28,575 --> 01:47:29,599
But I'll tell you
something,

2679
01:47:29,676 --> 01:47:31,405
I ain't done
too badly myself.

2680
01:47:31,511 --> 01:47:34,173
Uh, I manage
a shopping mall

2681
01:47:34,247 --> 01:47:35,839
down in
Florence, Alabama.

2682
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:39,010
Yeah. It's the number one
mall in Colbert County,

2683
01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:41,076
and it's number 4
in the state,

2684
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:42,917
So, it's not
too bad, you know?

2685
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:47,358
Uh, I play golf
several times a week, you know?

2686
01:47:47,427 --> 01:47:50,419
Uh, but
I'll tell you,

2687
01:47:50,497 --> 01:47:53,557
if Howard would have
listened to me,

2688
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:57,262
I'd still be
up there in radio.

2689
01:47:57,337 --> 01:47:59,430
Still be doing
radio, you know.

2690
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:02,701
How about that?

2691
01:48:06,413 --> 01:48:09,280
That goddamn motherfucker,
you know?

2692
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:13,448
I tried every fucking thing
I could fucking think of

2693
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:15,851
to mold him into
a proper kind of d.j.,

2694
01:48:15,922 --> 01:48:18,686
but that goddamn son of a bitch...

2695
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:22,994
I'll tell you...
Howard Stern, man.

2696
01:48:23,063 --> 01:48:27,966
That motherfuckin'...

2697
01:48:28,034 --> 01:48:31,333
And I'll say that
with no shame either!

2698
01:48:31,404 --> 01:48:33,998
Man's a...

2699
01:48:34,074 --> 01:48:36,065
Foul-mouthed,
immature...

2700
01:48:36,142 --> 01:48:38,007
the man's immature,
you know?

2701
01:48:38,078 --> 01:48:41,980
He's like a... child.

2702
01:48:42,048 --> 01:48:43,481
I'll tell you
this much.

2703
01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:46,781
There ain't no God while
Howard Stern's walking the earth,

2704
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:47,979
I'll tell you that.

2705
01:48:48,054 --> 01:48:49,043
I gotta go.

2706
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,990
How about that?
Howard Stern, huh?

2707
01:48:57,464 --> 01:49:00,365
Howard Stern can
kiss my ass in hell!

2708
01:49:01,305 --> 01:49:07,227
