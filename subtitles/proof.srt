00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,700
We all love
the richness of a good eye cream.

3
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,020
But it does leave a richness
or a greasiness under the eye.

4
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,820
Now let's take a look
at that nasty salsa stain.

5
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,860
This shirt is ruined. Right?
Wrong.

6
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,940
Watch the stain-fighting power of...

7
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,460
... designed with women in mind.

8
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,780
If you can twist it.
Turn it. Remove it.

9
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,660
Then you can fix it.
Replace it. Or improve it.

10
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,660
My kits includes a guidebook...

11
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,940
Plus they painted some people up
like animals. And now it's over.

12
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,580
If you think you need
to go to a gym to lose weight.

13
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,460
Stay in shape. And have a body like this.
Think again.

14
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,580
This is Bowflex. The real workout...

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,740
When you're looking for a home. Your
real estate agent is a big part of your life.

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,380
You need someone
you can count on.

17
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,860
Well. They studied science
and medicine in skin care.

18
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,060
And combined those to
in your skin solutions line.

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,100
That's exactly it. I so much
appreciate being able to be here.

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,340
Nice to have you with us.
As always.

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,260
We would love to take your phone calls.
This really is a very...

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,140
When you contact a RE/MAX agent
to help you buy yourself a home.

23
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,540
You expect service that's
a little out of the ordinary.

24
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,500
After all. RE/MAX agents average
more experience and more sales

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,740
than other agents.

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,260
So the next time you need outstanding
real estate service. Call RE/MAX.

27
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,060
Can't sleep?

28
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,140
Jesus.

29
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,740
Oh, you scared me.

30
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,260
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,860
- What are you doing here?
- I just thought I'd check up on you.

32
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,340
Why aren't you in bed?

33
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,340
Your student's still here.
He's up in your study.

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,860
He's not my student anymore.
He's teaching now. He's a bright kid.

35
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,020
- What time is it?
- After midnight.

36
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,340
- So?
- So?

37
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,380
- Happy birthday.
- Dad!

38
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,580
Do I ever forget?

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,940
Thank you.

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,540
27. I can't believe it.

41
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,420
Neither can I.

42
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,580
I forgot the glasses.
You want me to...?

43
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,220
No.

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,300
This is the worst champagne
I have ever tasted.

45
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,780
- It's not even champagne.
- The bottle's the right shape.

46
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,460
"Windy Valley Vineyards."

47
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,780
I didn't know they made wine in Wisconsin.
You want some?

48
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,980
I hope you're not spending
your birthday alone.

49
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,980
- I'm not alone.
- I don't count.

50
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,620
- Why not?
- I'm your old man. Go out with friends.

51
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,700
- Yeah, right.
- Aren't your friends taking you out?

52
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,060
- Nope.
- Why not?

53
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,860
For your friends to take you out, you have
to have friends. Funny how that works.

54
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,100
You have friends. What about that
cute blonde? Lives over on Ellis Avenue.

55
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,260
- You used to spend every minute together.
- Christie Jacobson?

56
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,100
Christie Jacobson.

57
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,540
- That was in third grade, Dad.
- Oh.

58
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,100
Last time I saw her was in a sandbox.

59
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,060
What about Claire?

60
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,500
She's not my friend.
She's my sister.

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,740
And she's in New York.
And I don't like her.

62
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,940
I thought she was coming in.

63
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,740
Not till tomorrow.

64
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,140
My advice if you can't sleep
is to sit down and do some mathematics.

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,660
- Please!
- We could do some together, the old way.

66
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,420
Can't think of anything worse.

67
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,380
- Line by line, out loud.
- Sure you don't want any?

68
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,380
You better get cracking. By the time I was
your age, I had already done my best work.

69
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,220
- How old were you?
- Hmm?

70
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,260
When it started.

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,420
What?

72
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,260
You know, when... you got sick.

73
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,980
Uh...

74
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,700
- 26, 27. Is that what you're worried about?
- I've thought about it.

75
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,900
Just because I went bughouse doesn't
mean you will. It's not strictly hereditary.

76
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,580
Listen to me. Life changes fast in your 20s,
and it shakes you up.

77
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,500
You're down, you've had a lousy couple of
years. No one knows that better than me.

78
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,540
- You're gonna be OK.
- I am?

79
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,540
Yes. I promise you.

80
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,260
The simple fact that we can
talk about this together is a good sign.

81
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,540
- A good sign?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,180
How could it be a good sign?

83
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,420
Because crazy people don't sit around
wondering if they're nuts.

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,100
- They don't?
- No. They've got better things to do.

85
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,660
Take it from me.

86
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,940
A very good sign that you're crazy is an
inability to ask the question, "Am I crazy?"

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,180
Even if the answer is yes?

88
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,220
Crazy people don't ask, you see?

89
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,460
Huh.

90
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,860
What do you say? Let's call it a night.
You can go up and get some sleep.

91
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,940
- Then in the morning...
- Wait.

92
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,460
- What's the matter?
- It doesn't make sense.

93
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,660
- Sure it does.
- No.

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,740
- Where's the problem?
- The problem is...

95
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,260
- You are crazy.
- So?

96
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,580
So you said a crazy person
would never admit that.

97
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,460
Ah. I see.

98
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,300
So?

99
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,220
- It's a point.
- So how can you admit it?

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,020
Well, because...

101
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,620
I'm also dead.

102
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,900
Aren't I?

103
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,100
- You died a week ago.
- Aneurysm. 63 years old.

104
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,860
The funeral's tomorrow.

105
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,700
Sorry.

106
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,180
- Did I... Did I hurt you?
- No. It's OK.

107
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,180
Good.

108
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,180
Mr. Dobbs, you gonna stand there forever?

109
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,260
This is my daughter Catherine.

110
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,020
- Hi.
- Hi.

111
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,300
Mr. Dobbs is in our infinite program.

112
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,140
As he approaches completion
of his dissertation,

113
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,100
time approaches infinity.

114
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,580
- Catherine?
- What?

115
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,300
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say
I'm done for the night.

116
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,220
Good.

117
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,420
- Champagne, huh?
- Yes.

118
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,860
- Celebrating?
- Do you want some?

119
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,260
- Sure.
- I'm done. You can take the rest with you.

120
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,620
Oh. Um...

121
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,620
- No, thanks.
- Take it. I'm done.

122
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,420
No. I'm driving. Um...

123
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,660
- I'll let myself out.
- Good.

124
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,820
- When should I come back?
- Come back?

125
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,260
Yeah. I'm no way near finished.
Maybe tomorrow?

126
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,860
We have a funeral tomorrow.

127
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,500
You're right. I'm sorry.
I was going to attend, if that's all right.

128
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,900
Sure.

129
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,020
What about Sunday?
Will you be around?

130
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,740
You've had three days.

131
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,980
I know you don't need
anybody in your hair,

132
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,700
but someone's got
to go through your dad's stuff.

133
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,780
- There's nothing up there.
- There are 103 notebooks.

134
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,860
He was a graphomaniac, Harold.
Do you know what that is?

135
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,740
He wrote compulsively.
Call me Hal.

136
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,300
It's like a monkey at a typewriter.
103 notebooks full of bullshit.

137
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,780
I'm prepared to look at every page.
Are you?

138
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,900
No.

139
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,180
I'm not crazy.

140
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,740
Well, I'm gonna be late.

141
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,380
Some friends of mine are in this band.

142
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,140
They're playing in a bar on Diversey,
way down the bill, around 2:30.

143
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,660
- I said I'd be there.
- Great.

144
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,300
They're all in the math department.
They're good.

145
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,620
They have this song called "i."
You'd like it. Lowercase i.

146
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,980
They just stand there.
They don't play anything for three minutes.

147
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,860
Imaginary number?

148
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,580
It's a math joke.
You see why they're way down the bill.

149
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,540
That's a long drive
to see some nerds in a band.

150
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,220
I hate when people say that.
It's not really that long of a drive.

151
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,700
- So they are nerds.
- Oh, they're raging geeks.

152
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,020
But they're geeks
who can dress themselves

153
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,260
and hold down a job at a major university.

154
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,700
Some of them have switched
from glasses to contacts.

155
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,980
They play sports. They play in a band.
They get laid surprisingly often.

156
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,100
So it makes you kind of question
the whole set of terms:

157
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,060
"Geek," "nerd," "wonk,"
"Dilbert," "paste-eater."

158
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,700
- You're in this band, aren't you?
- OK, yes.

159
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,940
I play the drums. You wanna come?
I never sing. I swear to God.

160
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,860
- No, thanks.
- All right, look. Catherine.

161
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,140
- Monday. What do you say?
- Don't you have a job?

162
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,980
- A full teaching load plus my own work.
- Plus band practice.

163
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,180
- Plus I teach hockey to ten-year-olds.
- You make me sick.

164
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,900
I don't have time to do this,
but I have to if you'll let me.

165
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,700
I loved your dad, and I don't believe
a mind like his can just shut down.

166
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,220
He had lucid moments, a lucid year,
a whole year three years ago.

167
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,780
- Sorry.
- Look, let me...

168
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,180
- Wait. You're 27, right?
- How old are you?

169
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,060
- Doesn't matter.
- How old are you?

170
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,180
I'm 26. When your dad
was younger than both of us,

171
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,540
he made major contributions to three fields:

172
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,020
- Game theory, algebraic geometry...
- Don't lecture me.

173
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,500
If I came up with a tenth
of the shit your dad produced,

174
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,220
I could write my ticket
to any math department in the country.

175
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,980
Give me your backpack.

176
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,940
Why?

177
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,260
- Because I wanna look inside it.
- What?

178
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,580
- Open it up and give it to me.
- Come on.

179
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,500
- You're not taking anything out of here.
- I wouldn't.

180
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,820
You're hoping to find something
you can publish?

181
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,980
- Sure.
- Then you can write your own ticket?

182
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,100
What? No, it would be
under your dad's name, for your dad.

183
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,740
- You have something in that backpack.
- What...?

184
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,540
- Give it to me!
- Look, you're being a little paranoid.

185
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,100
Just because I'm paranoid
doesn't mean there isn't something in...

186
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,660
You said yourself that there was
nothing up there, didn't you? Didn't you?

187
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,020
- Yes.
- So what would I take, right?

188
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,340
You're right.

189
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,020
Thank you.

190
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,180
Oh, what the hell...?

191
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,700
This isn't an airport.

192
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,580
You can come back.

193
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,220
The University Health Service
is very good.

194
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,260
I'm fine.

195
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,860
Also... exercise is great.

196
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,780
I go running along the lake
a couple mornings a week.

197
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,820
It clears my head.
It's not too cold yet.

198
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,220
If you wanted to,
I could pick you up.

199
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,580
No, thanks.

200
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,340
All right. Well, I'm gonna be
late for the show. I'd better go.

201
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,980
Good night.

202
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,780
- Wait. You forgot your jacket.
- Oh, no, you...

203
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,380
I'm paranoid?
You think I should go jogging?

204
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,020
- Just hold on.
- Get out. Get the hell out of my house!

205
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,140
Let me explain.
I wanna show you something.

206
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,620
- Give it back.
- Wait...

207
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,740
- I'm calling the police.
- What? Don't.

208
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,860
Look, I borrowed the book, all right?

209
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,380
'Cause I found something your father
wrote. Not math. Just something he wrote.

210
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,260
- I'd like to report a robbery.
- Put the phone down.

211
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,700
- A robbery.
- It's about you.

212
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,260
- He's in the house right now!
- Here's your name.

213
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,580
- I'm at 4655 South...
- "Catherine," see? "Catherine."

214
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,580
South...

215
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,100
"Not a bad day.
Some good news from Catherine."

216
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,140
I'm not sure what that meant.
I thought you might.

217
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,060
- When did he write this?
- Ma'am?

218
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,500
Three years ago. "Machinery's not working
yet, but there's cause for optimism."

219
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,220
The machinery is what he called his mind,
his ability to do mathematics.

220
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,620
I know.

221
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,180
"Talking with students helps,
so does riding in buses.

222
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,220
"Most of all Cathy.

223
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,100
"Her refusal to let me be institutionalized,
caring for me herself,

224
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,580
"has certainly saved my life.

225
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,820
"Made writing this possible.

226
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,740
"Made it possible
to imagine doing math again.

227
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,900
"Where does her strength come from?

228
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,380
"I can never repay her.
Today is her birthday.

229
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,940
"She is 24.
I'm taking her to dinner."

230
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,500
So what are we going
to do on your birthday?

231
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,660
- Dad...
- Let's get the hell out of this neighborhood.

232
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,220
Let's go to the North side or Chinatown.
Greektown. I don't know what's good.

233
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,220
- Dad?
- Hmm?

234
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,740
I'm going to school.

235
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,020
When?

236
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,860
I'm gonna start at Northwestern
at the end of the month.

237
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,860
Northwestern?

238
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,780
I shouldn't have tried to sneak it out. I know
it sounds stupid, but I was gonna wrap it.

239
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,020
Happy birthday.

240
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,820
What's wrong with Chicago?

241
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,140
You still teach there.

242
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:48,420
I'm sorry. That is too weird,
me taking classes in your department.

243
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,740
- It's a long drive.
- It's not that long. It's half an hour.

244
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,060
Still, twice a day.

245
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,460
Dad.

246
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,260
I'd live there.

247
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,540
You'd actually want
to live in Evanston?

248
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,940
I'd still be close.
I can come home whenever you want.

249
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,180
Look...

250
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,940
You've been well. You've been really well
for almost seven months now.

251
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,060
I don't think you need me here
every minute of the day.

252
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,660
- Yes?
- Someone here call the police?

253
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,660
No, honey.

254
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,100
I think we should put the aqua plates
on the registry and the brown couch.

255
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,060
Your mother wants to buy us
a substantial piece of furniture,

256
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,540
and that's the biggest thing that I could find
that will fit in our apartment.

257
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,220
Well, then, don't worry about it, honey.
I'll be home by tomorrow night.

258
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Yeah, let's just get through today first.
Hold on a second.

259
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,500
Hi!

260
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,500
Huh? Um...

261
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
I don't know.
She didn't pick up when I called.

262
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Hopefully better than yesterday.

263
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,980
First thing I'm gonna do is throw her into
the shower and get her out in the sun.

264
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,540
- Better. Much.
- Thanks.

265
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,700
- You feel better?
- Yep.

266
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,820
You look a million times better.

267
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,980
- Have some coffee.
- OK.

268
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,300
- No. Black.
- Have a little milk.

269
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,220
- Have a banana.
- No. Thank you.

270
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,060
Good thing I brought food.
There is nothing in the house.

271
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,380
I've been meaning to go shopping.

272
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,020
- Do you want a bagel?
- No. I hate breakfast.

273
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,420
- Coffee.
- Still making those lists, huh?

274
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,420
It's... It's a compulsion.

275
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,380
Do you ever cheat and tick off something
you haven't actually done yet?

276
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,060
Well, I would only be cheating myself.

277
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,300
Right.

278
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,260
Did you use that
conditioner I brought you?

279
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,140
- No. Shit. I forgot.
- Well, it's my favorite.

280
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,260
You'll love it, Katie.
I want you to try it.

281
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,260
- I'll try it next time.
- You'll like it. It has jojoba.

282
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,020
What is jojoba?

283
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,140
It's something they put in
for healthy hair.

284
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,100
- Hair is dead.
- What?

285
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,140
It's... It's dead tissue.
You can't make it healthy.

286
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,860
- Whatever. It's good for your hair.
- Like what? A chemical?

287
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,780
- No. It's organic.
- It can be organic and still be a chemical.

288
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,500
- I don't know what it is.
- Heard of organic chemistry?

289
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,580
It makes my hair look,
smell and feel good,

290
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,100
and that is the extent
of my information about it.

291
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,300
You might like it
if you decide to use it.

292
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,780
Thanks. I'll try it.

293
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,740
If you don't have anything to wear for
today, we could go shopping downtown.

294
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,820
OK.

295
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,900
It'll be fun.
My birthday present.

296
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,180
Great.

297
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,020
Is there anything else you need?

298
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,380
No. I'm cool.

299
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,900
- Anything at all while I'm here?
- Uh-uh.

300
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,020
I thought we'd have
some people over tonight.

301
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,380
If you're feeling OK.

302
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,940
We are burying Dad this afternoon.

303
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,580
You have to have something.
People expect it.

304
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,980
And it's the only time I can see
any old Chicago friends. It'll be nice.

305
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,100
I think Dad would've
wanted us to have a good time.

306
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,460
It's a funeral, but we don't
have to be completely grim about it.

307
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,980
- Mitch says hi.
- Hi, Mitch.

308
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,140
He sends you his love.
I told him you would see him soon, and...

309
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,340
- We're getting married.
- No shit.

310
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,980
- Yes. We just decided.
- Yikes.

311
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,020
Yes.

312
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,380
- Oh. When?
- In January.

313
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,300
You know, his job is great.

314
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,900
I just got promoted.

315
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,460
Huh.

316
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,540
- You will come?
- Yeah. Sure. In January?

317
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,300
I mean, it's not like I have
to check my schedule or anything. Sure.

318
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,340
- Do you know what you wanna do now?
- No.

319
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,020
- Do you wanna stay in Chicago?
- I don't know.

320
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,900
- Do you wanna go back to school?
- I haven't thought about it.

321
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,860
Well, there's a lot to think about.

322
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,100
- How do you feel?
- Physically? Great.

323
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,060
Except my hair seems unhealthy.
I wish there was something...

324
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,100
- Come on, Catherine.
- What is the point of all these questions?

325
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Katie, some police officers came by
while you were in the shower.

326
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,260
Yeah?

327
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,260
They said they were checking up on things
and wanted to see how everything was.

328
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,780
That was nice of them.
What about this?

329
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,020
They said they responded to a call
last night and came to the house.

330
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,900
Yeah?

331
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,180
- Did you call the police last night?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,940
Why?

333
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,060
Because I thought
the house was being robbed.

334
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,300
- But it wasn't?
- No. I changed my mind.

335
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,740
The police told me you seemed
disoriented and abusive.

336
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,060
These guys were assholes, Claire.

337
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,780
- They seemed perfectly nice.
- They wouldn't leave.

338
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,260
They wanted me to, like, fill out a report.

339
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,140
Were you abusive?

340
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,700
This one cop kept spitting on me
when he talked. It was disgusting.

341
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,500
Did you use the word "dickhead"?

342
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,180
I don't remember.

343
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,300
Did you tell one cop to go...
have sex with the other cop's mother?

344
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,380
No.

345
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,300
- That's what they said.
- Not with that phrasing.

346
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,620
- Did you strike one of them?
- They were trying to come into the house.

347
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,260
- Oh, my God.
- No! I might have pushed him a little.

348
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,700
- They said you seemed disturbed.
- They were trying to search my house!

349
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,420
- You called them.
- Yes.

350
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,540
But I didn't actually want them to come.

351
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,580
So why did you call?

352
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,740
Because I was trying
to get this guy out of the house.

353
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,140
- What is this man's name?
- Hal.

354
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,140
Harold. Harold Dobbs.

355
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,700
Because the police said
that you were the only person there.

356
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,860
- Because he left before they got there.
- With the notebooks?

357
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,900
No, Claire, don't be stupid.
There are over a hundred notebooks.

358
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,260
He was only stealing one.
But he was stealing it to give it back to me.

359
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,020
So I let him go so he could play with his
band on the north side. What about this?

360
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,380
- His band?
- He was late.

361
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,820
He wanted me to come with him.
I was like, "Yeah, right."

362
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,740
Is Harold Dobbs your boyfriend?

363
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,300
No.

364
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,580
- Are you sleeping with him?
- Ew!

365
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,820
No. He's a math geek.

366
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,540
And he's in a band?
A rock band?

367
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,300
No. A marching band.
He plays trombone.

368
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,420
Yes. A rock band.

369
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,380
- What is the name of this band?
- How should I know?

370
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,500
Harold Dobbs didn't tell you
the name of his rock band?

371
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,820
No.

372
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,340
Well, is Harold Dobbs...?

373
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,020
- Stop saying "Harold Dobbs."
- Is this person...?

374
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,220
- Harold Dobbs exists.
- I'm sure he does.

375
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,060
He's a mathematician at
the University of Chicago.

376
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,980
Call the freaking math department.

377
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,620
Mitch has become
an excellent cook. It's like his hobby now.

378
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,620
He buys all these gadgets:

379
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,260
Garlic press, olive oil sprayer.

380
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,420
Every night there's something new.

381
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,020
The other day he made vegetarian chili.

382
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,380
What are you talking about?

383
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,940
Stay with us for a while.

384
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,620
I'm OK here.

385
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,060
Chicago is dead.
New York is so much more fun.

386
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,620
Well, the fun thing is not really
where my head's at at the moment.

387
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,060
- You look so tired.
- I am.

388
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,900
- I just think you could use some downtime.
- Downtime?

389
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,900
Katie, please, you've had a hard time.

390
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,860
- I'm perfectly OK.
- I think you're upset and exhausted.

391
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,220
I was fine until you got here.

392
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,500
Wait.

393
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,660
Catherine!

394
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,980
Who is that?

395
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,420
Harold Dobbs!

396
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,540
Hi.

397
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,180
OK?

398
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,980
I really don't need this, Claire.

399
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,820
I'm fine, you know. I'm totally fine. And then
you show up here with these questions.

400
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,820
Like, "Are you OK?" with that
soothing tone of voice. And... Oh.

401
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,420
The poor policemen. I think
the policemen can handle themselves.

402
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,340
And bagels and bananas and jojoba.

403
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,900
And "Come to New York."
And vegetarian chili!

404
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,620
I mean, it really pisses me off,
so just save it.

405
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,220
- I'm Claire. I'm Catherine's sister.
- Oh, hi. Hal. Nice to meet you.

406
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,100
So he had to go back
and fix the paper in galleys.

407
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,060
He pretty much held it
together with baling wire.

408
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,420
This is a man who,
back in the UK, at the age of 22,

409
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,540
basically invented the mathematical
techniques for studying rational behavior

410
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:29,100
and gave the astrophysicists plenty
to think about when he came over here.

411
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,300
Men like Robert Llewellyn
come into the world very rarely.

412
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,620
And we will miss the man...
intensely.

413
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,060
But... the work will endure.

414
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,940
I'm not on the program.

415
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,260
Wow.

416
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,660
I can't believe how many people are here.
I never knew he had this many friends.

417
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,260
Where have you all been
for the last five years?

418
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,460
I guess to you guys
he was already dead, right?

419
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,460
I mean, what's a great man
without his greatness?

420
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,700
Just some old guy.

421
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,380
So you probably wanna catch up
on what you missed out on.

422
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,220
Um...

423
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:54,220
He used to read all day.
He kept demanding more and more books.

424
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,700
I was getting them out of the library
by the carload. There were hundreds.

425
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,300
And then one day I realized
he wasn't reading.

426
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,180
He believed aliens
were sending him messages

427
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,740
through the Dewey decimal numbers
in the books.

428
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,380
He was trying to work out the code.

429
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,140
He used to shuffle around in his slippers.

430
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,500
He talked to himself.

431
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,580
He stank.

432
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,660
I had to make sure he bathed,
which was embarrassing.

433
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,300
Then he started writing
19, 20 hours a day.

434
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,220
I got him this huge case of notebooks.
He used every one.

435
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,460
I dropped out of school.

436
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,300
You see, he was convinced that...

437
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,540
he was writing the most beautiful,
elegant proofs.

438
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,180
Proofs like music.

439
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,180
I'm glad he's dead.

440
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,980
Catherine.
Catherine.

441
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,660
Catherine.

442
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,060
Don't call the cops.

443
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,660
I can't believe I just said that.

444
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,540
No, it definitely pushed the envelope.

445
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,860
- I think I need to go home.
- Then I'll drive you.

446
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,060
No, that's OK.
I'm gonna walk.

447
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,260
It's a long walk.

448
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,900
Thanks.

449
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,980
Their day care is excellent.
We're starting to apply for preschools now,

450
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,660
which locks you into a commitment.

451
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,780
It does?

452
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,180
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

453
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,500
- Do you ever miss Chicago?
- No.

454
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,140
I mean, uh...

455
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,940
Um...

456
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,940
- No.
- You have the house now, though.

457
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,700
You and Mitch should move back
and fix it up.

458
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,620
You look great.

459
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,780
Claire gave it to me.

460
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,140
I... I like it.

461
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,300
It doesn't really fit.

462
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,900
Sure it does.

463
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,020
You can't prove it.

464
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,300
Well, I can try and disprove the opposite.

465
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,660
I can prove that it doesn't not fit.

466
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,100
How?

467
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,700
I could take a vote.

468
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,300
To your old man.
Hell of a guy.

469
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,460
Thank you.

470
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,820
Too bad he went nuts.

471
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,780
Hell of a guy anyway.

472
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,380
- What do you do?
- I'm a currency analyst.

473
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,660
I probably inherited
one thousandth of my father's talent.

474
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,180
- Are you a mathematician?
- Ooh. Christ, no.

475
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,820
Theoretical phys-physics.

476
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,900
- To the physicists.
- Drink up.

477
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,980
When do you think they'll leave?

478
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,660
No way to know.
Mathematicians are insane.

479
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,580
I went to this conference in Toronto last fall.
I have never been so exhausted in my life.

480
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,100
48 straight hours of
partying, drinking, drugs, papers, lectures.

481
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,100
- Drugs?
- Amphetamines mostly.

482
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,460
I don't. Some older guys, they're hooked.
They think they need it.

483
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,660
Why?

484
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,620
There's this fear that your creativity peaks
around 23, then it's all downhill from there.

485
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,140
That's what my dad thought.

486
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,620
I guess all the really original work,
it's... all young guys.

487
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,940
- Young guys?
- No, there are some women.

488
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,620
Really? Who?

489
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,740
There's a woman at Stanford.
I can't remember her name.

490
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,460
Sophie Germain?

491
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,620
Yeah. I think I've seen her at meetings,
but I don't think I've ever met her.

492
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,740
She was born in Paris in 1776.

493
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,260
Then I've definitely never met her.

494
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,500
Ah, I'm... Sophie Germain.

495
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,700
- I'm stupid. Germain primes.
- Right.

496
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,900
Double them, add one,
you get another prime.

497
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,700
Like two is prime,
double plus one is five, also prime.

498
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,820
Right.

499
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:32,620
Or 92,305 times two
to the 16,998th plus one.

500
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,740
Right.

501
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,500
That's the biggest one,
the biggest known one.

502
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,660
Coming through!

503
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,020
Oh, what the hell are they doing here?

504
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,620
OK.

505
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,780
Now we'd like to play a song
in tribute to a great man,

506
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,980
a great mathematician.

507
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,820
It's called "i."

508
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,020
One, two, one, two, three...

509
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,940
You're probably right.
That book I stole?

510
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:28,260
I'm starting to think it's the only lucid one,
and there's no math in it.

511
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,180
No.

512
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,140
I mean, I'll keep reading,

513
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,540
but if I can't find anything
in the next couple of days...

514
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,180
Back to the hockey rink?

515
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,780
Yep.

516
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,940
And your own research.

517
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,580
Such as it is.

518
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,500
What's wrong with it?

519
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,580
The big ideas aren't there.

520
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,580
Well, it's not about big ideas.
It's... It's work.

521
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,780
You got to chip away at a problem.

522
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,620
- That's not what your dad did.
- I think it was, in a way.

523
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,340
I mean, he'd attack a problem from the
side, you know, from some weird angle.

524
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,780
Sneak up on it, grind away at it.

525
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,860
I don't know.

526
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,780
I don't know. I'm just guessing.

527
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,900
I enjoy teaching.

528
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,340
- You might come up with something.
- It's not gonna happen. I'm 26.

529
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,740
Remember the downward slope?

530
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,900
- Have you tried speed? I heard it helps.
- Yeah.

531
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,060
So...

532
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,700
This is my room.

533
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,980
Wow. You read a lot of math.

534
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,980
No. I read Cosmo.
That's just window dressing.

535
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,300
You're a mysterious person, Catherine.
You know that?

536
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,740
You want a drink?

537
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,140
I'm OK.

538
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,940
We never got
to celebrate your birthday.

539
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,540
OK.

540
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,180
Um...

541
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,420
I'm sorry. I just...
I'm a little drunk.

542
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,060
It's OK.

543
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,340
I'm a little out of practice.

544
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,020
I always liked you.

545
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,220
- You did?
- But then I thought:

546
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,620
"You don't flirt
with your doctoral adviser's daughter."

547
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,140
Especially when your adviser's crazy?

548
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,340
Especially then.

549
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,340
I saw you at my dad's office once.
Do you remember?

550
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,020
I can't believe you remember that.

551
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,540
I remember you.

552
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,620
I thought that you seemed...

553
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,300
not boring.

554
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

555
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,500
Oh, I feel like
I'm gonna crack open like...

556
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,500
Like what?

557
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,180
An egg.

558
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,580
Or one of those really
smelly French cheeses

559
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,940
that ooze out everywhere
when you cut them.

560
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,020
Nice.

561
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,340
Catherine.

562
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,900
How long have you been up?

563
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,220
A while.

564
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,460
Is your sister up?

565
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,900
No.

566
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,740
Her flight leaves in a couple of hours.
I should probably wake her.

567
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,180
Let her sleep.
She did some serious drinking

568
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,500
with the theoretical physicists last night.

569
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,020
I'll make her some coffee
when she gets up.

570
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,140
Sunday mornings I usually go out,
get the paper, have some breakfast.

571
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,660
OK.

572
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,020
Do you wanna come?

573
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,020
Oh.

574
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,020
Well, I should probably stick around
until Claire leaves.

575
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,660
OK.

576
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,260
Do you mind if I stay?

577
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,940
No.

578
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,780
You can work if you want.

579
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,900
All right.

580
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,140
- Should I?
- You can if you want to.

581
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,380
- Do you want me to go?
- Do you wanna go?

582
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,580
- I wanna stay here with you.
- Oh.

583
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,060
Wanna spend the day with you,
if at all possible.

584
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,380
I wanna spend
as much time with you as I can,

585
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,940
unless I'm coming on way too strong
and scaring you,

586
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,460
in which case
I'll begin back-pedaling immediately.

587
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,900
How embarrassing is it if I say
last night was wonderful?

588
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,420
It's only embarrassing
if I don't agree.

589
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,100
So?

590
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,380
Don't be embarrassed.

591
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,820
What?

592
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,540
Here.

593
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,700
The drawer in the desk
in my dad's office.

594
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,980
What's in there?

595
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,020
Now?

596
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,020
- Good morning.
- Please, don't yell. Please.

597
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,500
- Are you all right?
- No.

598
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,420
- Theoretical physicists.
- What happened?

599
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,580
Thanks a lot for
leaving me alone with them.

600
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
That band.

601
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,500
Yeah.

602
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,420
- They were terrible.
- They were OK. They had fun, I think.

603
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,620
Well, as long as everybody had fun.
Your dress turned out all right.

604
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,340
- I love it.
- You do?

605
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,380
Yeah. It's wonderful.

606
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,580
- I was surprised you even wore it.
- I love it, Claire.

607
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,100
Thanks.

608
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,860
You're welcome.
Well, you're in a good mood.

609
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,140
- Should I not be?
- Are you kidding? No, I'm thrilled.

610
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,020
It's just... I...

611
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,380
Hold on a second, Katie.
I just...

612
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,660
- I'm leaving soon, and...
- I know. You said.

613
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,300
I would still like you
to come to New York.

614
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,900
Yes. January.

615
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,260
I would like you to move to New York.

616
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,420
Move?

617
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,220
You could stay with me and Mitch at first,
and then you could get your own place.

618
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,980
I've already scouted some apartments
for you. Really cute places.

619
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,020
What would I do in New York?

620
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,900
You could do whatever you want. You
could work. You could go back to school.

621
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,180
I don't know, Claire,
this is pretty major.

622
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,100
I realize that.

623
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,420
I know you mean well, OK?

624
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,140
Well, to be honest,
you were right yesterday.

625
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,660
It's been a pretty weird couple of years,

626
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,300
and I think I'd just like to take some time
and figure things out.

627
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,820
But it would be much easier for me to get
you set up in an apartment in New York.

628
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,420
I don't need an apartment.
I'll stay in the house.

629
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,020
We're selling the house.

630
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,900
What?

631
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,220
I'm hoping to do the paperwork this week.
I know that seems sudden.

632
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,500
No one was here looking at the place.
Who are you selling it to?

633
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,580
The university.
They've wanted it back for years.

634
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,860
I live here.

635
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,300
Come to New York.
We'll have so much fun.

636
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,620
- I don't believe this.
- It would be so good.

637
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,740
You deserve a change. This would be
a whole new adventure for you.

638
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,380
- Why are you doing this?
- I want to help.

639
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,620
By kicking me out of my house?

640
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,980
- This is my house, too.
- Please! You haven't lived here for years.

641
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:18,020
I know that. You were on your own. I really
regret that, Katie. And now I want to help.

642
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,780
You wanna help now?

643
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,380
Yes.

644
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,140
Dad is dead.

645
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,740
- I know.
- He's dead.

646
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:30,100
Now that he's dead, you fly in for
the weekend and decide you wanna help?

647
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:35,060
You're late. Where have you been?
Where were you five years ago?

648
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,860
- I was working.
- I was here.

649
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,620
I lived with him alone.

650
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,540
I was working 14-hour days.

651
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:48,140
I paid off the mortgage on this house while
living in a studio apartment in Brooklyn.

652
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,500
You had a life.
You got to finish school.

653
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,580
- You could've finished school.
- How?

654
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,620
I told you a million times
to do anything you wanted.

655
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,980
- And what about Dad?
- He was ill.

656
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,340
He should've been in a full-time
professional care situation.

657
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,140
He didn't belong in the nuthouse.

658
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:10,220
- He might have been better off.
- He needed to be here in his own house,

659
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,580
near everything
that made him happy.

660
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,140
Maybe.

661
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,700
Or maybe some real professional care
would have done him more good

662
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,100
than rattling around in this mausoleum
with you looking after him.

663
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,940
What about his remission? Three years
ago, he was healthy for almost a year.

664
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,300
- Then he went downhill again.
- He might have been worse in a hospital.

665
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,540
He might have been better.
Did he ever do any work again?

666
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,380
- No.
- No. And you might have been better.

667
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,740
Better... than what?

668
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,780
You had so much talent.

669
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,660
You think I'm like Dad.

670
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,660
I think you have some of his talent

671
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,700
and some of his tendency
toward instability.

672
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,100
Claire.

673
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:02,060
In addition to the cute apartments
that you've scouted for me in New York,

674
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,380
have you by any chance devoted
some of your considerable energies

675
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:10,140
towards scouting out another type of living
facility for your bughouse little sister?

676
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,900
No. Absolutely not.
That is not what this is about.

677
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,180
Don't lie to me, Claire.

678
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,700
- The resources that I've investigated...
- My God.

679
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,780
If you wanted. All I'm saying is, the doctors
and the people in New York are the best.

680
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,060
- Jesus!
- You wouldn't have to live...

681
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,380
- I hate you!
- Don't yell.

682
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,020
I hate you!

683
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,100
What are you doing here?

684
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,940
How long have you known about this?

685
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,100
A while.

686
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,620
Why didn't you tell me about it?

687
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,020
I wasn't sure if I wanted to.

688
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,740
Thank you.

689
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,500
You're welcome.

690
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,620
- What's going on?
- Catherine, thank you.

691
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,900
- I thought you might like to see it.
- What is it?

692
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,620
- It's incredible.
- What is it?

693
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,660
Oh, it's a result, a proof.

694
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,100
It looks like a proof. It is a proof.
A very long proof.

695
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,500
I haven't read through it all yet or checked
it. I don't even know if I could check it.

696
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:12,020
But if it's a proof of what I think
it's a proof of, it's a very important proof.

697
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,500
What does it prove?

698
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,900
It looks like it proves a mathematical
theorem about prime numbers

699
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,020
which mathematicians have been trying
to prove since there were mathematicians.

700
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,940
You know about this?

701
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,780
- Is it any good?
- It's historic, if it checks out.

702
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,900
What does it mean?

703
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,700
It means that when everybody
thought your dad was crazy,

704
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,220
he did some of the most
important mathematics ever.

705
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,220
If it checks out, it means you publish
instantly. You hold press conferences.

706
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,420
It means that all newspapers
around the world

707
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,500
are gonna want to talk to the person
who found this notebook.

708
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,540
- Catherine.
- Catherine.

709
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,900
I didn't find it.

710
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,260
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

711
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,740
- Did you find it or did Hal find it?
- I didn't find it.

712
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,940
I didn't find it.

713
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,620
I wrote it.

714
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,660
- Hey, guys.
- Where you headed?

715
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,180
- I'm late for Bhandari.
- You know what he's like. Better get there.

716
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,060
Catch you later.

717
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,820
Yeah.

718
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,980
Ah. Catherine.

719
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,460
- So nice of you to drop by.
- Sorry I'm late.

720
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,860
- This work of yours...
- I know. I'm sorry.

721
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,700
- I mean, it's interesting.
- You think so?

722
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,220
In that it has nothing to do with
the problems I'd asked you to solve.

723
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,180
- It won't happen again.
- What happened?

724
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,540
You simply couldn't control yourself?

725
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,580
No. I just... I thought I should get all those
ideas down while they were in my head,

726
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,420
and then it was morning,
and I couldn't come in with nothing.

727
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,700
But this is the third time
that inspiration's overtaken you

728
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,380
just at the moment when
you had to submit to my idea

729
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,500
of what it is you should be learning.

730
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,180
- A third? Really.
- Differential equations don't interest you.

731
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,460
No, they do. I mean...
Yeah, they absolutely do.

732
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,100
Oh, but they didn't last night.

733
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,140
Not as much as usual.

734
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,140
I mean...

735
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,220
I'm worried that your work
is deteriorating.

736
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:58,580
There are some good ideas here, but...
it isn't a coherent mathematical argument.

737
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:03,100
- Well, I didn't get time to finish it.
- But mathematics isn't jazz.

738
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,660
Even the craziest mathematics
is working towards a proof.

739
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,580
Not all the mathematicians
in my family are crazy.

740
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:15,740
- I wasn't using the word in a clinical way.
- I know. I know. Just for the record.

741
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,980
How is your father?

742
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
I don't know. I haven't been able
to get in touch with him for a week.

743
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,020
He's fine.

744
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,900
Last time I talked to him, he was fine. He's
been fine for months now. Nine months.

745
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,940
He was a great man.

746
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,780
He still is.

747
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,420
You're gonna fail me, aren't you?

748
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,780
I'm giving you another chance
to redo the problem set.

749
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,660
You need an A.
You're quite capable of earning one.

750
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,900
Thank you.

751
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,940
- Professor Bhandari?
- Yeah.

752
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,060
Don't worry about me, OK?

753
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,980
I'm gonna write you a really nice fat set
of answers that you're really gonna like.

754
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,060
Hi. We're not here.
Please leave a message.

755
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,580
Claire? Hi. Listen.
When was the last time you spoke to Dad?

756
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,860
Tuesday? Oh, God.

757
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,540
It's fine. It's just that
I normally talk to him every day,

758
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,660
and I haven't been able
to get ahold of him.

759
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,420
Well, I'm glad that
you're sure everything's fine.

760
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,620
I feel much more comfortable.
Thank you.

761
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,580
What could have happened?
I mean, he could've had a car accident.

762
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,980
He could've fallen and broken his hip.

763
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,300
He could be running naked
down the Midway for all I know.

764
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,980
Yes, Claire, I know
that you care about Dad.

765
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,780
Yeah, as much as me. OK.
Now can I please get off the phone?

766
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,180
Dad?

767
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,060
Hello!

768
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,420
Dad?

769
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,820
Dad!

770
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,260
Dad?

771
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,340
Catherine, hi.
What a surprise.

772
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,020
- What are you doing out here?
- I'm thinking.

773
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,860
Writing.

774
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,500
It's 30 degrees.
It's the middle of the night.

775
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,380
- I know.
- Well, aren't you cold?

776
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,740
Of course I am.
I'm freezing my ass off.

777
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,100
So what are you doing out here?

778
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,860
It's too hot in the house. The radiators
clank and I couldn't concentrate.

779
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,060
I've been calling and calling.
Did you not get my messages?

780
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,340
It's a distraction.

781
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,580
I didn't know what was going on.
I had to drive all the way out here.

782
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,020
I can see that.

783
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,660
- Why don't you answer the phone?
- I'm sorry, Catherine.

784
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,300
But it's a question of priorities,
and work takes priority. You know that.

785
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,660
You're working?

786
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,380
Goddamn it!

787
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm working!

788
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,540
I mean, I say "I."

789
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,860
Machinery.

790
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,220
The machinery's working, Catherine.

791
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,420
It's on full blast.
All the cylinders are firing.

792
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,740
I'm on fire.

793
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,340
That's why I came out here to cool off.
I haven't felt like this for years.

794
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,100
- You're kidding.
- No.

795
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,660
- I don't believe it.
- I don't believe it either, but it's true.

796
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,420
It started about a week ago.
I woke up.

797
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,300
I came downstairs,
made a cup of coffee.

798
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,660
Before I could pour the milk in, it was like
someone turned the light on in my head.

799
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,940
- Really?
- Not the light. The whole grid. I lit up!

800
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,140
It's like no time has passed
since I was 21.

801
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,740
- You're kidding me.
- No. I'm back.

802
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,020
I'm back. In touch with the source!
The font.

803
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,100
Whatever the source of my creativity was
all those years ago, I'm in contact with it.

804
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,980
I'm sitting on it. It's a geyser,
and I'm shooting up in the air on top of it.

805
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,260
God.

806
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,620
I'm not talking about divine inspiration. It's
not funneling into my head, onto the page.

807
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,340
I'm not saying it won't be a lot of work.
It will be, a tremendous amount of work.

808
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,220
It's not gonna be easy.
But the raw material is there.

809
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,820
I see places for the work to go,
new techniques.

810
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,060
I'm gonna get whole branches
of the profession talking to each other.

811
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,900
I'm sorry.

812
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,260
I'm being rude.

813
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,860
- How's school?
- School's fine.

814
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,740
- You're working hard?
- Sure.

815
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,580
- Faculty treating you all right?
- Yes.

816
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,980
- Made any friends?
- Yes.

817
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,100
- You dating?
- Dad.

818
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,900
No details necessary
if you don't want to provide them.

819
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,340
School is fine, OK?
I want to talk about what you're doing.

820
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,580
Great. Let's talk.

821
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,460
- This work...
- Yes.

822
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,060
- It's here?
- Part of it, yes.

823
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,420
- Can I see it?
- It's all at a very early stage.

824
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,100
- I don't care.
- It's not complete.

825
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,580
To be honest, it's all in progress.
I think we're talking years.

826
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,100
Dad, it's OK.
Just let me see anything.

827
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,580
- You really want to?
- Yes.

828
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,500
- You're genuinely interested?
- Dad, of course.

829
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,980
Of course. It is your field.

830
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,700
Yes.

831
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,140
You know how happy that makes me?

832
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,380
Yes.

833
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,700
I think there's enough here to keep me
working the rest of my life. And not just me.

834
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,820
I was starting to imagine I was finished,
Catherine. Really finished.

835
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,900
I was terrified I'd never work again.
Did you know that?

836
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,700
- I wondered.
- I was absolutely bloody terrified.

837
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,940
Then I remembered something.
I remembered you.

838
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,060
Your creative years were just beginning.
You'd get your degree, do your own work.

839
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,260
If you hadn't gone into math,
that would've been all right.

840
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,580
Now, Claire's done well for herself.
I'm satisfied with her.

841
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,420
I'm proud of you!

842
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,140
I know you've got your own work,
and I don't want you to neglect that.

843
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,980
You mustn't neglect it.
But I could probably use some help.

844
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,660
To be honest, I'd like you to help me,
to work with me, if you want to.

845
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,380
If you can work it out with your class
schedule. I could help you with that.

846
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Make some calls,
talk to your teachers.

847
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,740
I'm sorry.
I'm getting ahead of myself.

848
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,500
Oh, Jesus, look, enough bullshit.

849
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,420
You asked to see something.
Let's start with this.

850
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,420
I have roughed something out.
It's a general outline for a proof.

851
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,220
It's a major result.
It's important.

852
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,540
It's not finished, but, uh...
you can see where it's going.

853
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,540
Uh...

854
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,180
Here.

855
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,300
It's very rough.

856
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,660
- Was there any other work in here?
- No. That's the only...

857
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,980
Can I see it?

858
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,700
I'm sorry. I just...

859
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,620
So you wrote this incredible thing,
but you didn't tell anyone?

860
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,340
I'm telling you both now.

861
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,500
Catherine, I'm sorry,
but I just find this very hard to believe.

862
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,460
- Claire...
- This is Dad's handwriting.

863
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,700
It's not.

864
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,460
- It looks exactly like it.
- That is my writing.

865
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm sorry.

866
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,740
Well, ask Hal. He's been
looking at Dad's writing all week.

867
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,140
- Well, I don't know.
- Hal, come on.

868
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,980
- I'm not a handwriting expert.
- Well, whose writing does it look like?

869
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,220
It looks... I don't know
what Catherine's handwriting looks like.

870
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,380
It looks like that.

871
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,820
OK.

872
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,100
You know what I think?
I think it's early,

873
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,420
and everybody's tired and not in
the best state to make emotional decisions.

874
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,540
- So let's just all take a breath.
- You don't believe me.

875
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,100
Well, I really don't know
anything about this.

876
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,900
Never mind.

877
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,300
I don't know why I expected you
to believe me about anything.

878
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,740
Could you tell us the proof?
And then that would show that it was yours.

879
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,780
You wouldn't understand it.

880
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Well, tell it to Hal.

881
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,980
I mean, I could. We could sit down
and talk it through. It might take a while.

882
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,820
- You can't use the book.
- For God's sake, it's 40 pages long.

883
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,860
I didn't memorize it.
It's not a muffin recipe.

884
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Oh, Jesus, this is stupid.

885
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,820
- Hal, tell her.
- Tell her what?

886
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,100
- Whose book is that?
- I don't know.

887
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,820
What is the matter with you?

888
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,020
You've been...
You've been going through this other stuff.

889
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,020
You know there's nothing
even remotely like that up here.

890
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,340
- Catherine...
- OK. OK.

891
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,500
OK, we'll sit down
and I'll talk you through the proof.

892
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
OK? OK?

893
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,980
If Claire will please
let me have my book back.

894
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,820
All right. OK, talk him through it.

895
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,860
- It still wouldn't prove that she wrote it.
- Why not?

896
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,060
Your dad may have written it
and explained it to you later.

897
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,820
I'm not saying he did.
I'm saying there's no proof that...

898
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,460
Of course there isn't. But come on!
He didn't write it. He couldn't have.

899
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,860
Even in the year he was well,
he couldn't work.

900
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,540
You know that.
You're supposed to be a scientist.

901
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,020
Here's my suggestion. I know
three or four guys at the department,

902
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,740
sharp, disinterested people,
who knew your dad's work.

903
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,380
- I'll take this to them.
- What?

904
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,620
I'll tell them that
we found something potentially major.

905
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,140
We're not sure of the authorship.
I'll sit with them.

906
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,180
We'll talk through it,
and we'll figure out what we've got.

907
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,820
It might take a couple days,
but then we'd have a lot more information.

908
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,420
I think that's an excellent suggestion.

909
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,020
- You can't.
- Catherine.

910
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,900
- You can't take it.
- I am not taking it.

911
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,380
- This is exactly what you wanted.
- Oh, come on. Jesus...

912
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,500
You don't waste any time, do you?
It's no hesitation.

913
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,540
You can't wait to show them
your brilliant discovery.

914
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,060
- I am trying to determine what this is.
- I'm telling you what it is.

915
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,460
- You don't know!
- I wrote it!

916
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,780
It is your father's handwriting!

917
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,660
At least, it looks an awful lot
like the writing in the other books.

918
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,380
Maybe your writing looks exactly like his.
I don't know.

919
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,140
It does look like his.

920
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,660
I mean, it's one of his notebooks,
the exact same kind he used.

921
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,100
I told you.
He gave it to me.

922
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,820
I didn't show this to anyone.

923
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,380
I wanted you to be the first to see it.
I didn't know I wanted that until last night.

924
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,140
- I trusted you.
- I know.

925
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,460
- Was I wrong?
- No.

926
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,900
I should've known that she
wouldn't believe me, but why don't you?

927
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,300
I know how hard it would be
to come up with something like this.

928
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,060
You'd have to be your dad
at the peak of his powers.

929
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,140
Just because you
and the rest of the geeks worshipped him

930
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,780
does not mean he wrote the proof.

931
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,580
He was the best. My generation
hasn't produced anything like him.

932
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,380
He revolutionized the field
twice before he was 22.

933
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,620
I am sorry. You took some classes
at Northwestern for a few months.

934
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,740
- My education wasn't at Northwestern!
- Even so, it doesn't matter.

935
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,220
It's too advanced.
I don't even understand most of it.

936
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,140
- You think it's too advanced?
- Yes.

937
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,460
It's too advanced for you.

938
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,620
You could not have done this work.

939
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,860
- But what if I did?
- Well, what if?

940
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,500
It would be a real disaster for you.

941
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,220
Wouldn't it?

942
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,820
You and the other geeks
who barely finished your PhD's,

943
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,780
who are marking time
doing lame research,

944
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,460
bragging about
the conferences they go to.

945
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,420
Wow.

946
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,860
Playing in an awful band and whining
that they're intellectually past it at 26,

947
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,660
because they are!

948
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,860
Catherine.

949
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,460
Catherine.

950
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,580
Oh!

951
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,660
When are you going to do
some mathematics with me?

952
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,700
I can't think of anything worse.
You want some Parmesan?

953
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,100
I'm all alone. I have important things
to say, and you're not helping.

954
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,980
- You used to love it.
- Not anymore.

955
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,460
You knew prime numbers
before you could read.

956
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,820
- Well, now I've forgotten.
- Don't be lazy, Catherine!

957
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,380
I haven't been lazy.
I've been taking care of you.

958
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,140
You dropped out of school.
You sleep till noon.

959
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,820
You eat junk. You don't work.
Dishes pile up in the sink.

960
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,460
- Some days you don't even get out of bed.
- Those are the good days.

961
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,540
They're fever days and you sweated them
away. You'll never know what work you lost

962
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,100
because you were moping, moping
in your unmade bad. Always moping.

963
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,940
Up until four in the afternoon sometimes,
Catherine.

964
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,460
I have you on my clock.
You know I'm right.

965
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,340
You know, I'm told by some very important
people. You know I know.

966
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,980
- I've lost a few days.
- How many?

967
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,340
- I don't know.
- I bet you do. I bet you count.

968
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,500
- Knock it off.
- How many days have you lost?

969
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,340
- A month. Around a month.
- Exactly.

970
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,300
- Dad, eat your dinner.
- How many?

971
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,700
- 33 days.
- Be precise, for Christ's sake.

972
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,020
I slept till noon today.

973
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,420
Make it 33 and a quarter days.

974
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,620
Yeah, all right.

975
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
- You're kidding.
- No.

976
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,580
- Amazing number.
- It's a depressing fucking number.

977
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,860
If every day you lost were a year, it would
be a very interesting fucking number.

978
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,100
- 33 and a quarter years is not interesting.
- Stop it. You know exactly what I mean.

979
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,460
- 1729 weeks.
- 1729. Great number.

980
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,500
The smallest number expressible as the
sum of two cubes in two different ways.

981
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,460
12 cubed plus 1 cubed equals 1729.

982
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,460
And 10 cubed plus 9 cubed...
Yes, we've got it. Thank you.

983
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,700
You see?

984
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,820
Even your depression
is mathematical.

985
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,820
Stop moping.

986
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,180
Do some work.

987
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,100
Take a look.

988
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,340
Catherine?

989
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,500
Katie, honey?

990
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,700
Catherine.

991
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,380
I figured out how to get
a lower bound for L.

992
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,860
Modification of Landau-Siegel.

993
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,540
What if this L had a Siegel zero?

994
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,220
You'd need an effective version.

995
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,180
Shit.

996
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,020
Catherine.

997
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,260
Catherine!

998
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,020
Catherine!

999
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,060
- What?
- Aah! Jesus!

1000
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,620
God, you scared me.
What are you doing there?

1001
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,500
Sorry. I just...
I wanted to...

1002
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,420
It's wonderful news.

1003
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,420
I think I've got it.

1004
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,060
Catherine!

1005
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,340
Katie.

1006
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,420
- Katie, what is it?
- It's not mine. It's not mine!

1007
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,740
- It's not mine. It's his. It's not mine.
- What, honey?

1008
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,100
- It's not mine. It's not mine.
- What, honey? What's the matter?

1009
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,700
I stole it from him.
I stole it. It's not mine.

1010
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,140
- What do you mean, you stole it?
- It's not mine.

1011
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,220
OK.

1012
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,220
- I killed him. I killed him.
- No, honey. No.

1013
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,460
I never should have written it.
I never should have written it.

1014
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,700
- OK. You're OK.
- I never should have written it.

1015
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,100
Is it...?
Is it possible, honey, that...?

1016
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,260
Is it possible that you
just wanted to so badly

1017
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:28,100
and you... you deserved to do something
special like this thing, this proof?

1018
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,460
Is it possible
that you just imagined that you wrote it?

1019
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,700
Hmm?

1020
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,300
Is it possible
that it really was Dad's after all?

1021
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,060
Hmm?

1022
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,380
Is that possible?

1023
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,500
You didn't kill him, sweetheart.

1024
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,940
He just died, that's all.

1025
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,420
He just died.

1026
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,020
Hi. We're not here.
Please leave a message.

1027
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,700
Catherine. It's me again.
I really need to speak to you.

1028
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,180
So please call me back.

1029
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,900
Can I take these for you?

1030
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,820
Claire!

1031
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,900
- I thought you'd left.
- I had to delay my flight.

1032
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,980
Where's Catherine?
I need to talk to her.

1033
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,980
- She's inside.
- This thing...

1034
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,660
checks out.

1035
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,100
I've been over it with two sets of guys,
old geeks and young geeks.

1036
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,700
It's weird.

1037
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,100
I don't know where the techniques
come from, it is very hard to follow,

1038
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,580
but we can't find anything wrong with it.

1039
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,180
I mean, there may be something
wrong with it, but we can't find it.

1040
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,420
I have not slept.

1041
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,420
It's real.

1042
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,380
Thank you.

1043
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,900
See, I had to swear these guys to secrecy.

1044
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,980
They were jumping out of their skins.

1045
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,060
One email, it's all over.

1046
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,540
I threatened them.
Yeah, I think we're safe.

1047
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,860
They're physical cowards.

1048
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,340
- Where's Catherine?
- This is not a good time.

1049
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,060
You're leaving?

1050
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,220
- The flight is at noon.
- You're taking her away?

1051
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,820
Yes.

1052
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,460
- To New York?
- Yes.

1053
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,580
- You're just gonna drag her away?
- She's entirely happy to come.

1054
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,460
- I'd like to speak to Catherine.
- She doesn't want to see you.

1055
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,460
Does she have any say
in whether she goes?

1056
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,940
She's been completely out of it, Hal.

1057
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,540
Five days she wasn't speaking.

1058
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,540
Do you want your coat, sweetie?
It's cold.

1059
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,060
I'll get your things. The movers
will get anything we've forgotten.

1060
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,380
Are you all right?

1061
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,780
It works.

1062
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,340
I thought you might wanna know.

1063
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,780
- I had to see you.
- I'm leaving.

1064
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,220
- Just wait a minute.
- What? What do you want?

1065
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,900
You have the book.
She told me that she gave it to you,

1066
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,300
so do whatever you want with it.

1067
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,580
Publish. Go for it.
Have a press conference.

1068
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,420
Tell the world
what my father discovered.

1069
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,100
I don't think your father wrote it.

1070
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,060
- You thought so last week.
- That was last week.

1071
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,380
I spent this week reading the proof.
I think I understand it.

1072
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,180
It uses a lot of newer
mathematical techniques,

1073
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,820
things that were developed
in the '80s and '90s.

1074
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,140
Noncommutative geometry,
random matrices.

1075
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,980
I think I learned more mathematics this
week than in three years of grad school.

1076
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,260
- So?
- So the proof is very...

1077
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,780
- hip.
- Get some sleep, Hal.

1078
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,540
- What was your father doing for 20 years?
- Are you done?

1079
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,220
He wouldn't have been able to master
those new techniques.

1080
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,500
- He was a genius.
- But he was nuts.

1081
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,900
- So he read about them later.
- Maybe.

1082
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,500
The books he would've needed
are upstairs in your room, some of them.

1083
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,340
He dated everything. Even his
most incoherent entries, he dated.

1084
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,580
- There are no dates in this.
- The handwriting.

1085
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,940
Parents and children can
have similar handwriting,

1086
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,500
especially if they've spent
a lot of time together.

1087
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,380
Interesting theory.

1088
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,340
I like it.

1089
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,180
I like it, too.

1090
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,220
It's what I told you last week.

1091
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,500
I know.

1092
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,020
- You blew it.
- This is yours, Catherine.

1093
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,900
It's too bad, too,
'cause the rest of it was really good.

1094
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,660
"I loved your dad." "I always liked you."
"I wanna spend every minute with you."

1095
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,940
That's killer stuff.

1096
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,060
I meant it.

1097
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,860
You got laid and you got the notebook.
You're a genius.

1098
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,580
Talk to me, Catherine.

1099
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,820
- This proof is yours.
- Forget it.

1100
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,020
You'll have to deal with it eventually.
You can't just ignore it.

1101
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,420
- You'll have to publish.
- Leave me alone, Hal.

1102
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,180
- Take it at least.
- I don't want it.

1103
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,140
- Come on. I am trying to correct things.
- You can't!

1104
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,460
Do you hear me?

1105
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,580
You think you've figured something out?

1106
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,740
You run over here all pleased with yourself
because you changed your mind?

1107
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,460
Now you're certain?
Hal, you don't know anything.

1108
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,180
The book, the math,
the dates, the writing,

1109
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,620
all that stuff you just decided
with your buddies, it's just evidence.

1110
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,300
- It doesn't prove anything.
- OK, what would?

1111
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,060
Nothing.

1112
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,540
You should've trusted me.

1113
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,060
I...

1114
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,380
I know.

1115
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,180
Claire sold the house?

1116
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,340
She wants me in New York.
She wants to look after me.

1117
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,420
What? Do you need looking after?
You looked after your father for five years.

1118
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,660
- So maybe it's my turn.
- There is nothing wrong with you.

1119
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,700
We should be on our way, honey.

1120
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,260
You can't just walk away,

1121
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,060
pretend like it never happened and then
get a job at Urban Outfitters or something.

1122
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,780
- Just take it.
- Katie, honey, let's go.

1123
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,860
Stay in Chicago.
You're an adult.

1124
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,140
I gotta go.

1125
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,220
- Please.
- No.

1126
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,260
- Catherine, this isn't about me.
- Katie, come on.

1127
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,700
Don't you owe this to yourself at least?

1128
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,020
Goodbye, Hal.

1129
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,300
Catherine!

1130
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,460
Catherine!

1131
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,580
- Hi. And where are you going today?
- To New York City.

1132
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,620
Can I see some photo ID, please?

1133
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,220
Wow. You sure got a lot done.

1134
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,100
Well, I had five extra days.

1135
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,860
I need some more coffee.
Do you want some?

1136
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,100
Am I on that list?

1137
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,580
What?

1138
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,220
"Square away crazy sister."

1139
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,900
Check.

1140
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,180
That's not fair, Katie.

1141
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,740
I just wanna take care of you.

1142
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,460
Catherine!

1143
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,580
- What?
- Aah! Jesus!

1144
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,100
God, you scared me.
What are you doing there?

1145
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,980
Sorry. I just...
I wanted to...

1146
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,140
It's wonderful news.

1147
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,300
I think I've got it.

1148
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,740
What do you think?

1149
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,820
- Wow, Dad.
- Can you believe it?

1150
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,740
I knew you had it in you.

1151
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,980
That's a pretty
mealy-mouthed response.

1152
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,660
What about it? What do you think?
Let's talk it through.

1153
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,420
Not tonight. I'm tired.

1154
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,460
Come on. This is the beginning
of our real work together.

1155
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,580
You think I've stolen the thunder
because I broke through first?

1156
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,940
This is only the beginning.

1157
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,260
- I think we should call it a night.
- Read out the first couple of lines.

1158
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,620
We go line by line out loud,
see if there's a better way, a shorter way.

1159
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,900
No. Come on. Tomorrow.

1160
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,460
I've waited years for this, goddamn it.

1161
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,340
- Let's do some work together.
- Dad, I think we should get some sleep.

1162
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,380
- Not until we talk about the proof!
- I don't want to talk about it.

1163
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,500
Goddammit, open the goddamn book!
Read me the lines!

1164
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,460
"Let X equal the quantity
of all quantities of X.

1165
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,780
"Let X equal the cold.

1166
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,860
"It is cold in December.

1167
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,100
"The months of cold
equal November through February.

1168
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,820
"There are four months
of cold and four of heat,

1169
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,020
"leaving four months
of indeterminate temperature.

1170
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,020
"In February. It snows.

1171
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,700
"In March. The lake is a lake of ice.

1172
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,300
"In September.
The students come back

1173
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,260
"and the bookstores are full.

1174
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,420
"Let X equal the month
of full bookstores.

1175
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,380
"The number of books
approaches infinity

1176
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,260
"as the number of months of cold
approaches four.

1177
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,140
"I will never be as cold now
as I will in the future.

1178
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,980
"The future of cold is infinite.

1179
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,780
"The future of heat
is the future of cold.

1180
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,140
"The bookstores are infinite

1181
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,660
"and so are never full
except in September."

1182
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,220
I'm exhausted.

1183
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,140
I can't wait to get back
to the coffee at home.

1184
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,260
We have a place where we buy coffee.
They roast it themselves.

1185
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,780
They have an old roaster down in the
basement. You can smell it on the street.

1186
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:16,100
Some mornings you can smell it from
our place, four stories up. It's wonderful.

1187
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,580
"Manhattan's Best."
Some magazine wrote it up.

1188
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,780
I mean, who knows?

1189
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,140
But it's very good.

1190
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,100
I think...

1191
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,780
I'm actually gonna give up coffee
'cause it's bad for my nerves.

1192
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,620
Catherine.

1193
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,460
Catherine!

1194
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,260
How many days have I lost?

1195
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,140
How can I get back
to the place where I started?

1196
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:18,420
I'm outside a house.
Trying to find my way in.

1197
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,700
But it is locked and the blinds are down.

1198
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,260
And I've lost the key.

1199
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,860
And I can't remember what the rooms
look like or where I put anything.

1200
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,140
And if I dare go in inside. I wonder...

1201
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,500
will I ever be able to find my way out?

1202
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,980
Sometimes in my head I think it works,
and then...

1203
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,620
Sometimes I just think it's...
crazy.

1204
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,540
There's nothing wrong with you.

1205
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,020
I think I'm like my dad.

1206
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,660
I think you are, too.

1207
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,060
I'm afraid I'm like my dad.

1208
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,860
- You are not him.
- Maybe I will be.

1209
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,340
Maybe, and maybe you'll be better.

1210
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
It was like...

1211
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,460
connecting the dots.

1212
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,100
Some nights I could connect
three or four of them,

1213
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,780
and some nights
they'd be really far apart.

1214
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,940
I'd have no idea how to get to the next one,
if there was the next one.

1215
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,300
It just seems
really stitched together and lumpy.

1216
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,940
Dad's stuff was way more elegant.

1217
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,500
Talk me through it
and tell me what's bothering you.

1218
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,140
You got a bit of ground to make up, Dobbs.

1219
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,820
You know that?

1220
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,300
And there's no way
to prove that I wrote it.

1221
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,860
No. But we could sit down,

1222
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,300
we could talk it through and
