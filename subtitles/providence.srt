2
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:30,982
Damn, damn, damn!

3
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:32,137
Damn!

4
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,332
Surely the facts are
not in dispute?

5
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,265
This man...

6
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:11,256
a harmless enough old
creature by all accounts

7
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:14,068
was running away
from an army patrol.

8
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:17,738
He was sick, terrified.

9
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,444
You're hurt...

10
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:30,007
Please!

11
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,434
And you killed him,
did you not?

12
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:36,227
He was mortally wounded
when I found him.

13
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:40,083
And you Kevin Woodford took it upon
yourself to put him out of his pain.

14
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:42,734
He said he was dying,
he begged me to finish him off.

15
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:44,577
A sick old man...

16
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:45,591
frightened...

17
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,515
doubted himself out of his wits.

18
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:50,711
No doctor present?
No medical orderlies?

19
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:56,761
We hope not many such
fall into your hand.

20
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:12,030
It wasn't just his bullet
wounds from the patrol.

21
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:13,217
Really?

22
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:14,834
His illness...

23
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,101
he had...

24
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,939
he was...

25
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,413
turning into an animal.

26
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:27,183
Are you being metaphorical Woodford?

27
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,908
Or are you suggesting some
kind of actual metamorphosis?

28
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,766
A werewolf.

29
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,744
A werewolf perhaps?

30
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,724
Well, well, well.

31
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:40,665
Changing...

32
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:42,316
It seemed to me

33
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:46,723
into some kind of animal.

34
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,712
How extraordinary!

35
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:50,516
Well...

36
00:06:50,636 --> 00:06:54,593
That obviously justified you
finishing him off, didn't it?

37
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,543
I'm not saying that.

38
00:06:56,955 --> 00:07:00,414
We shall not try to penetrate the odd
recesses of your imagination Woodford.

39
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:04,182
We shall ask you exactly what you
are trying to saying about his death.

40
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:05,771
Did you feel you personally
have the right

41
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:07,863
to arbitrate on a matter
of life and death?

42
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:11,817
Please!

43
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:20,145
I was confused.

44
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:22,490
As indeed I'm sure we all
are in this court today.

45
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,600
- But it wasn't murder.
- But you did shoot him?

46
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,610
Yes.

47
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,689
And you seriously plea that
this was an act of mercy?

48
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,307
Yes.

49
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:33,613
Well as in the eyes of the law
it was plain homicide.

50
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:35,376
I was confused.

51
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,683
As indeed I'm sure we all
are in this court today.

52
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:39,813
- But it wasn't murder.
- But you did shoot him?

53
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:40,841
Yes.

54
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,072
And you seriously plea that
this was an act of mercy?

55
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:45,623
Yes.

56
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:48,717
Well as in the eyes of the law
it was plain homicide.

57
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:50,537
I think maybe...

58
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:53,329
people should be allowed
to die the way they choose.

59
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:55,061
Ah, I see.

60
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:59,576
An expose of some higher moral law
to which you have privileged access.

61
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:00,798
I wouldn't say that exactly.

62
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,701
No, but some moral argument

63
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,565
which exonerates you
from the charge of murder.

64
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,065
- I'd say that. Yes, I would.
- Hmm, I see.

65
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,719
So you feel that your
action lies outside

66
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,255
the inadequate and pathetic
assumption of this court...

67
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,516
that wilful slaughter
is murder?

68
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:22,587
Why are you so
contemptuous?

69
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:40,473
The idiosyncratic notions of moral law
which exist within the accused's head

70
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,701
are not our concern.

71
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,649
However innocent he is
within his own eyes,

72
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:48,070
he is guilty before the
laws of the state.

73
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,830
We are here to decide not whether
his action was justifiable,

74
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,194
nor even comprehensible,

75
00:08:56,014 --> 00:08:57,727
only if it is criminal.

76
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:02,674
We have the medical evidence
here of Dr. Mark Eddington.

77
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,527
We have the accused's own word.

78
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:09,425
And we have the unequivocal
nature of the law of the state.

79
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:13,431
I'm assure the ladies and
gentlemen of the jury...

80
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:17,595
I'm sure that your
conclusions

81
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:18,767
must be...

82
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:21,416
inevitable.

83
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,085
Oh, Sonia!

84
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:42,305
Why did you marry that petrified
lawyer, the son of mine.

85
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:44,033
I tried to warn you...

86
00:09:44,153 --> 00:09:46,479
It'll have to be rewritten

87
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,653
in so little time.

88
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:48,930
And...

89
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,627
Oh shit!

90
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:53,335
It's Mark Eddington.

91
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:56,980
Damn it, I'll make you
a friend of Claude's.

92
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:00,025
I haven't seen you for ages.

93
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:01,893
What did you make
of that, then?

94
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,867
Well, you've seen Claude
prosecuting before.

95
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,953
He was hateful today,
I'm furious!

96
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,082
I wouldn't say that...

97
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:11,684
Fury in Claude isn't
like most people,

98
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:13,424
comes out ice-cold,

99
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:14,605
logical.

100
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:16,978
The jury was obviously
sympathetic to that boy.

101
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:21,242
And it's not Claude's way to
let that confuse the issue.

102
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:27,683
What a strange young man.

103
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:29,683
Funny sort of crank
to find in the army.

104
00:10:29,803 --> 00:10:32,174
Crank? I thought what
he did was brave.

105
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:33,703
- Well I...
- Mark.

106
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,365
You're going to have lunch
with Claude and me.

107
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,038
Come on, join us at Luigi's
in about half an hour.

108
00:10:39,158 --> 00:10:41,335
- Yes, fine, I'd love to.
- Ya, alright.

109
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:43,163
But dear I'd...
Oh.

110
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:45,920
Sonia!

111
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,643
Wait a minute!

112
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:52,114
But what are you in my
scheme of things Eddington?

113
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,220
The Jolly old, bloody old
doctor character?

114
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:57,550
God forbid...

115
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:00,410
Here he is again!

116
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:02,713
Never liked you Eddington,

117
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,838
never understood what
Claude saw in you.

118
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,076
I'm getting rid of you at once.

119
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,063
Sonia!

120
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:11,802
Here now...

121
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:12,783
What she...

122
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:16,549
Of course, she's intrigued.

123
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:18,740
She wants to meet that
Kevin Woodford.

124
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:23,261
I get it. He wants to cut me up.

125
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,789
Shall we let him try?

126
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:27,454
Wait a minute though...

127
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:30,463
right hospital,
wrong pathologist.

128
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,551
Wasn't Eddington going to
lunch with Sonia and Claude?

129
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,613
Oh, get out of my mind!

130
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:41,310
I regret nothing! Damn and blast you!

131
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:45,035
My love and respect
for the human body...

132
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:46,787
the hard muscle,

133
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,283
fine skin.

134
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:55,233
At Cap Ferrat, those days
salty and strong out of the sea.

135
00:11:55,353 --> 00:11:57,983
Not a vain man, well...

136
00:11:58,103 --> 00:12:00,420
"Ugly", Molly used to say.

137
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,921
Green,

138
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,868
but handsome in your
own fashion Clive Langham.

139
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:07,961
I loved the sun, loved
the cold wine...

140
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,097
Christ, I can taste it now!

141
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:15,415
God, what a tailor's dummy he is.

142
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:17,975
Your mother...

143
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:20,471
Ah, Molly where are you?

144
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,811
She always had the wine chilled
to exactly the right temperature.

145
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:27,199
And prawns
red in their shells.

146
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:32,062
Yes, I see her laughing there
on the terrace in the sun.

147
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:33,111
We...

148
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:35,251
Can't you take a hint?

149
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:37,373
Didn't I say bugger off!

150
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:40,126
You think this horrifies me?

151
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,179
All the pain before I care about.

152
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,292
Well, there's the
morphine I suppose...

153
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:49,919
Verdict: "Not guilty"

154
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,655
There wasn't a jury in there.

155
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:56,832
There was a twelve man
law reform commission.

156
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:00,950
I wonder why Sonia
asked me to lunch.

157
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,629
Well, why shouldn't she?

158
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,431
She's always seeking
allies these days.

159
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,201
What's the matter with you?

160
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,036
We've know each
other for thirty years

161
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,890
and trusted each
other for nearly ten.

162
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,444
It was a command really.

163
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,711
Are you and she in
some sort of crisis?

164
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:18,194
Oh, for Christ's sake Mark, really!

165
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:21,312
She always thinks I'm prosecuting her
when she sees me in court.

166
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:25,756
Do you resent the
boy getting off free?

167
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,745
Well, I have no things
about him whatsoever.

168
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,199
What about losing the case?

169
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,069
Oh, I think my reputation
will stand up.

170
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,375
Where the hell is she?

171
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:44,122
Look, I'm going to have a pee
and then I'm going to order.

172
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:48,198
Oh, I got another of those telegrams
this morning from my father.

173
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:50,390
He's still dying,
of course.

174
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,546
I've never known anyone take
quite so long about it.

175
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,013
And do it in such good health.

176
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:00,933
Claude.

177
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:04,321
I thought you might like to
meet Kevin Woodford.

178
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:06,780
I have met him.

179
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:10,677
To apologize for your aggressiveness
in court, I thought.

180
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,402
I was just going for a pee.

181
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,936
- Why did you whether bring you here?
- I don't mind where I go.

182
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:22,583
I never mind where I am.

183
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:26,095
Oh dear!
I think he's fey.

184
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:28,113
It's always tiresome.

185
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,904
You are fey aren't you?

186
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:32,395
Oh, I know that you
have inner peace.

187
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:36,382
That usually implies no powers
of rational thinking.

188
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:38,023
Whatsoever...

189
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,605
I don't feel like lunch today...

190
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:44,939
suddenly.

191
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,485
Oh Hell!

192
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:08,561
These places are almost becoming
de rigueur as fear symbols.

193
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:13,117
Jolly well, bloody old
de rigueur, eh.

194
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,898
Well, if one's had
a fatuous life

195
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:18,522
one might as well have
fatuous nightmares.

196
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,595
But I am frightened.

197
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:26,483
You will not get me,
you fucking bastards!

198
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,270
That's right children,
go in, go in.

199
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,207
Why not in Claude's house?

200
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,720
Let battle commence!

201
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:21,453
Yes.

202
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:22,473
In here.

203
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,431
Bang on Clive Langham!
Get it down!

204
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,060
No.

205
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,219
No, stop...

206
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,831
it could seem vulgar.

207
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,112
And must not!

208
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,234
Now, that's fascinating.

209
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,888
Yes, I approve of that.

210
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:43,717
Do get on with it children.

211
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,884
My god, he doesn't look
as if it's urgent though...

212
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:58,125
Not angry when rejected...

213
00:16:58,245 --> 00:16:59,995
but wistful.

214
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:01,083
Good, good.

215
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:04,670
But what about the
tyrannical lawyer himself?

216
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,104
Where would he be?

217
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:08,750
OK, so in his office then.

218
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,914
And furthermore father since there is
no point in telephoning you,

219
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:15,047
far less in visiting you, which
would only be exposing ourselves

220
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,155
to our now familiar
mutual recriminations.

221
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,898
Damn it all father,
you're a rich man!

222
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:28,439
If you must do your
dying with such a...

223
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,554
disgusting lack of dignity.

224
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:33,392
Why don't you do it in
a nursing home?

225
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,226
Or some such place...

226
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,432
Where they can
stand in...

227
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:40,774
amazed, well paid tolerance,

228
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:46,559
while you shout and drink and
protest your way to death's dark door.

229
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:53,092
The silence when you reach
the other side will be our

230
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:55,685
only reassurance that
you're actually gone.

231
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:00,117
And I could add...

232
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:01,630
I could add...

233
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:06,072
When you find yourself
potentially alone.

234
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:07,917
You sod!

235
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:11,542
You odious, sanctimonious,
stiff-necked little crumb.

236
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:14,142
I'm not having this, by god!

237
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,789
Watch it Langham.

238
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,851
The blood pressure...

239
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:20,399
I mean to say...

240
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,029
If I don't know how to die,
at least I knew how to live.

241
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:32,102
But what about that mistress
of yours, my son?

242
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,082
What did I do with her?

243
00:18:34,202 --> 00:18:35,680
Don't tell me I mislaid her.

244
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,717
I-diddle-i-de a drunken life for me.

245
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:44,057
Damned it I'm giving you
to the dreaded Claude.

246
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,664
I could do with you myself...

247
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:49,997
if I could just get off this bed,
out of this coffin of a room.

248
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:56,392
Yes, you'll do for the moment.

249
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,734
You can be Claude's mistress.

250
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:01,609
Quick, quick, quick,
first name into the mind...

251
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:02,592
Helen...

252
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:03,894
Wiener

253
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:04,925
Ya.

254
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,001
Intellectual journalist.

255
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:11,140
Goes to conferences on every bloody
thing, that's you Helen Wiener.

256
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:15,471
Just another wee drinkie whilst
they get you onto terra firma.

257
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,463
Did you know...

258
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,446
Did you know,

259
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:37,504
those astronauts who've
been to the moon

260
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,992
It's had a peculiar effect
on some of them.

261
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,861
Lurching about on a lump of
frozen rock hanging in space.

262
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:46,761
Claude's due back.

263
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,431
I think of God's eyes
watching them.

264
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:54,669
A pair of huge brilliant eyes somewhere
out there beyond the sun,

265
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:56,340
brighter then the sun.

266
00:19:56,894 --> 00:20:00,134
Kevin, I'm not overawed
by the universe.

267
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:04,410
It's a very peaceful place
you have here,

268
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,013
you and Claude should like it
quite a lot I should imagine.

269
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,573
And you also imagine that we
should get out before he arrives?

270
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,720
I've never done this before.

271
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,471
I always thought if I did it would be
somewhere else and in the sweat of guilt.

272
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:19,748
On his account...

273
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:22,246
I'm quite easy in
most situations.

274
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:27,473
You see there's every indication
that some of the astronauts

275
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,284
have been profoundly disturbed
by going out there.

276
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:32,365
- Kevin.
- Yes?

277
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:39,787
Why are you so bloody obsessed
by the fucking astronauts?

278
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:44,241
Why do you go on
about the astronauts?

279
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:47,614
Well I think it all
has its poetic side.

280
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,154
Clomping about under
the stars and so on.

281
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:55,733
Sod the moon.

282
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:57,898
No poetry there anymore.

283
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,405
Another of those stabbing
pains right up the arse!

284
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:10,593
Then another stinger
coming right down the spine.

285
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:12,847
Meet the one from
the backside.

286
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:18,561
Out there...

287
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:21,058
in the icy universe...

288
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:24,075
there's nothing.

289
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:37,006
Physiological disaster...

290
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:41,183
there'll be some reddish brown stains
on the underpants yesterday.

291
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:43,752
No more doctors!

292
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:51,723
I suppose he'd meet his
mistress in a motel.

293
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:53,397
No...

294
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,435
Here, Claude, here.

295
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,256
You can't, not now.

296
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:01,885
Mustn't go home.

297
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:06,737
It's inconvenient.

298
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:11,705
Or is it...

299
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,797
Now...

300
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,194
Am I springing Claude on them?

301
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,960
It will give me no end of fun.

302
00:22:36,914 --> 00:22:38,704
With me it was almost
the other way round,

303
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,515
husbands catching me
with their wifes.

304
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:43,312
Bang, thump, wallop.
Down you go Langham.

305
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:46,074
Always the bungler...

306
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:50,732
Never caught anyone with my wife.

307
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:08,158
I don't actually smell sex.

308
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,276
Hasn't there been any?

309
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,414
You should meet my brother.

310
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:30,024
He'd take it just like you,
he's a famous footballer.

311
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:32,733
The telephone...
Why not?

312
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:35,973
What would you say was
interesting about him?

313
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:40,336
I mean, what exactly is the
point about him, his attraction?

314
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:42,986
Any clues about yourself, Woodford?

315
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:44,202
Any ideas...

316
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:51,777
If your wife's attracted to me,
I think that's your problem not mine.

317
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:56,029
I don't I've ever been
a problem have I, Claude?

318
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:59,993
Problems have a way of acquiring
status in a relationship you see.

319
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:07,610
Hello.

320
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:11,452
Helen.

321
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:13,768
Where?

322
00:24:15,513 --> 00:24:18,425
No, I'm having a drink in the
bedroom with my wife,

323
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,083
and the young man
she seems keen on.

324
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,065
Now?

325
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:25,235
Yes.

326
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,917
Right away.

327
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:30,888
Who's Helen?

328
00:24:34,871 --> 00:24:36,849
I despise you Woodford.

329
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,247
I'm sorry about that.

330
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:42,335
He's frightfully unattractive.

331
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:46,514
I mean, it doesn't matter whether
you're good enough for my wife...

332
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:48,639
but are you good enough for me?

333
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:51,293
I really don't think so.

334
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:52,604
Who is Helen?

335
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,378
I don't remember.

336
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,698
I don't remember...

337
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:08,479
I think he'd better get off
and meet old Helen.

338
00:26:09,242 --> 00:26:11,163
Oh, there goes
another thing.

339
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:22,099
Slip the suppository
into position.

340
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:29,317
No such luck for me,
a sudden coronary.

341
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:31,232
No, it has to be...

342
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:34,899
slow, squalid and messy things.

343
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:38,897
Live by the guts and
die by the guts.

344
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:50,081
Now let science soothe
the troubled rectum.

345
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:53,024
And back to business...

346
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:57,851
I-diddle-i-de-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum.

347
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:15,839
Who does not know the mixture of fear and
excitement of going to meet an old flame.

348
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:18,259
Carrying one's thundering prick...

349
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:22,090
Already composing
the get out clauses,

350
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,577
just in case she's cooked up
an actual demand,

351
00:27:25,697 --> 00:27:29,373
or the erstwhile reliable
member should fail

352
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:31,532
in it's exquisite duties.

353
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:34,009
And what's more
if the new encounter

354
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:37,258
should turn out disastrous
from the word "Go".

355
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:40,901
Will one be able to get rid of her
with a dash of style?

356
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:42,746
A little panache?

357
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:58,787
Not you Woodford,
damn and bugger you!

358
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:01,388
Christ he's intractable this one.

359
00:30:01,912 --> 00:30:03,772
I'll never get the hang of him.

360
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:05,378
Out! Out!

361
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:41,647
She looks like his mother.

362
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:45,830
Clearly the boy must have
an unconscious mind,

363
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:47,830
just like everybody else.

364
00:30:49,706 --> 00:30:51,134
Oh, Molly...

365
00:31:03,065 --> 00:31:04,631
You look well.

366
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:06,300
I'm dying.

367
00:31:13,636 --> 00:31:16,086
Have you ever heard
of an allegedly...

368
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:20,127
famous footballer...

369
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:21,552
called Woodford?

370
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:27,360
How's your wife?

371
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,201
I'm thinking of killing
this footballer's brother.

372
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:36,374
It's one of those rare, slow, deadly
diseases you can have without knowing.

373
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:41,186
Then it suddenly accelerates and
nothing can stop it, or reverse it.

374
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:45,149
Suddenly you are
not just ageing,

375
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:48,739
you are irrevocably dying.

376
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:54,578
How's your father?

377
00:31:54,698 --> 00:31:56,217
He's still dying.

378
00:32:02,074 --> 00:32:03,686
Well, he's an old man.

379
00:32:04,015 --> 00:32:07,103
There is no necessary connection
between one's age

380
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:10,081
and the length of time
taken to die.

381
00:32:11,745 --> 00:32:13,979
I am told I have about six months.

382
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:16,503
Maybe a year...

383
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:18,092
We must make the most of it.

384
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:20,563
What a bastard!

385
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:22,191
Great! Smashing!

386
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:27,321
Of course it's been said about
my work that the search for style

387
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:30,584
has often resulted
in a want of feeling.

388
00:32:32,804 --> 00:32:35,051
My goodness, does he
find this erotic?

389
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:38,235
However but I'd put it another
way I'd say that,

390
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:40,153
style is feeling,

391
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:42,823
Its most elegant and
economic expression.

392
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:47,071
Ten out of ten, Clive Langham.

393
00:32:56,492 --> 00:33:00,527
Christ, it's the bloody footballer,
the dreaded younger Woodford!

394
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:06,713
He can't just, just trundle in here
and take a shower.

395
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:08,021
Can he?

396
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:09,938
So what to do?

397
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:12,404
I suppose we could start up
again in another hotel.

398
00:33:14,212 --> 00:33:15,733
We could live together.

399
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,716
And leave Sonia?

400
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,634
To watch me die?

401
00:33:20,904 --> 00:33:22,649
Shouldn't everyone live as
if they're about to die,

402
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:25,227
not next week, nor
next month but now?

403
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:27,086
Anyway...

404
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,293
it's impossible.

405
00:33:29,471 --> 00:33:31,974
So how do you and Sonia live?

406
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:37,884
In a state of unacknowledged mutual
exhaustion behind which we scream

407
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:40,578
silently.

408
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,515
Sounds binding.

409
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:48,049
I learnt self control as a reaction
against my father, it started as a habit

410
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,732
then became a trap.

411
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,524
We squirmed...

412
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:55,737
How did you get out?

413
00:33:57,565 --> 00:33:59,267
Maybe you really scream...

414
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:00,847
No, I never have...

415
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:04,402
No, you have to have a big passion,
a compelling reason.

416
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:06,830
I've had neither of those...

417
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:08,873
neither, I think, has she.

418
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,930
How glad I am

419
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,696
I chose to live alone,

420
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:22,422
right from the beginning.

421
00:34:23,532 --> 00:34:24,542
Are you?

422
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,678
I feel nothing at all.

423
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:36,876
He can say that again.

424
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,538
Damn!

425
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:43,618
He'll be bloody well
blind anyway.

426
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:46,457
Poor Claude!

427
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,304
What a thin owlish little sod
you were at school.

428
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:53,580
Prig from the
word "Go."

429
00:34:56,865 --> 00:35:00,032
Ought we not always to live
as if one's going to die.

430
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:02,851
Eyes like marbles.

431
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:07,217
"Why haven't you got the
Nobel Prize daddy?"

432
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,140
"Our English master says you aren't
nearly as good as Graham Greene."

433
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:13,931
Beset the bugger, say I.

434
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:20,746
Some of us, fuckface, wonder why Graham
Greene hasn't got the Nobel Prize either.

435
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:26,824
He once offered to teach me
how to masturbate.

436
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:28,654
Your father?

437
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:30,754
I was deeply shocked.

438
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:33,486
He'll have to go into a
nursing home, of course.

439
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,215
Eight housekeepers
in five months.

440
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,819
Nobody tries still...

441
00:35:38,939 --> 00:35:40,477
he tries to screw them.

442
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:44,106
You are not going to put that extraordinary
old man in a nursing home.

443
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,849
That purely incontinent,
ageing infant!

444
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:50,907
You just resent his independence,
just as you'd resent mine,

445
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:52,194
if I had any.

446
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:56,952
You're not a husband or a son,
you're a goddamn jailer.

447
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,204
How's Kevin?

448
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:02,809
And being a goddamn jailer is the
nearest thing you've got to an instinct.

449
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,705
You must want him very much.

450
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:07,246
Well I don't want you very much.

451
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:08,313
Not anymore...

452
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,005
You must be forcefully
attracted to him.

453
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,142
I want...

454
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:13,824
I want...

455
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:17,456
I suppose you fancy he's got the
poetic spirit, or something like that.

456
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,176
I want...

457
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:20,787
I would like...

458
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:23,888
I...

459
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:25,223
I...

460
00:36:26,235 --> 00:36:26,928
I!

461
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:29,135
First person singular!

462
00:36:32,071 --> 00:36:35,458
Do I have to oppose you to
reassure myself that I exist?

463
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:40,393
Let's just say there's something
in Kevin that intrigues me.

464
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:41,487
In him?

465
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,678
You mean inside him?

466
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,663
A kind of visionary?

467
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,598
Funny pictures, in his head?

468
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,652
Chubby little people with wings?

469
00:36:54,772 --> 00:36:55,796
Get out.

470
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,172
Get out!

471
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:58,334
Get out!

472
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,424
Now look I do insist...

473
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,642
We must do something about father.

474
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:16,857
When will you pull
yourself together?

475
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:18,636
You're always sniveling.

476
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:20,837
Shall we never be free of you?

477
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:26,427
Well, yes father I...

478
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,583
I admire your books very much.

479
00:37:29,308 --> 00:37:31,837
I think you're a very fine writer indeed.

480
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:36,858
And I hope that you die with every
nerve end in your body shrieking.

481
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:40,092
When will you pull yourself together?
You're always sniveling.

482
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,907
Shall we never be free of you?

483
00:37:46,393 --> 00:37:47,681
Yes, father I...

484
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,086
well, yes I do...

485
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:52,782
He's improving, improving.

486
00:37:53,586 --> 00:37:54,571
So now...

487
00:37:56,048 --> 00:37:58,790
How about a half of
cold champagne.

488
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:02,851
Petite truffles.

489
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:15,762
Damn footballer, must've got
lost in that hotel somewhere.

490
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:45,045
Molly...

491
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:50,563
If you're out there in the
cosmic dark somewhere,

492
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:54,541
don't wait for me.

493
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,043
I'm not coming.

494
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:11,055
There we go...

495
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,351
the tremors, the warnings.

496
00:39:14,303 --> 00:39:18,086
Once death seemed like a gentlest
earthquake of the system,

497
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:20,145
but now...

498
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:23,387
gathering force,
after the years.

499
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:27,330
What I really mean to
say Molly is, of course,

500
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,467
I'd prefer not to come.

501
00:39:50,027 --> 00:39:52,251
I think we'll try this one again.

502
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,926
How's Helen?

503
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:00,627
He killed her.

504
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,262
Father killed her really.

505
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:06,993
Those holidays of
ours at Cap Ferrat.

506
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,384
He tortured her.

507
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,911
He was always randy
when he had a hangover.

508
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:25,143
There's a chap in football gear...

509
00:40:25,263 --> 00:40:26,820
jogging along the street.

510
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,074
I haven't been...

511
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,540
no, I wouldn't say
bored with you.

512
00:40:32,148 --> 00:40:34,161
Self eliminating, yes.

513
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,709
Clever of you to catch
me at seventeen.

514
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:39,859
Well I've been dreaming
you'd wake up.

515
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,925
You became my authority.

516
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:43,814
There's a deep sadness...

517
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:45,803
You remain my only authority...

518
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:48,476
As if dreaming is my only
real level of existence.

519
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:53,488
And so I passed from childhood,
more or less...

520
00:40:53,608 --> 00:40:55,604
to wifehood?

521
00:40:57,445 --> 00:40:59,941
Without the tiresome
intervention of a....

522
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:03,144
developing personality in between.

523
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:07,234
I'm not a person...

524
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:09,326
I'm a fucking construction.

525
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:12,060
Yours...

526
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:14,528
Was...

527
00:41:19,992 --> 00:41:25,004
After certain dreams nothing in waking
life can have such intensity.

528
00:41:29,936 --> 00:41:31,872
Even if it's a common fiction,

529
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,077
it's still poignant.

530
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,592
One thinks...

531
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:41,699
ho-hum.

532
00:42:21,484 --> 00:42:23,639
You might as well drink my drink too.

533
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:44,004
Not Molly!

534
00:42:44,124 --> 00:42:45,734
You can't have my wife!

535
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:49,954
Do I resemble your mother?

536
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:54,059
There's something...

537
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:04,723
Mugged!

538
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:08,095
Yes, mugged!

539
00:43:10,907 --> 00:43:13,413
This city is definitely falling to pieces.

540
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:17,192
All hell out there sometimes.

541
00:43:20,086 --> 00:43:22,722
My last conscious words were...

542
00:43:25,128 --> 00:43:29,170
On the question of subatomic
particles, gentlemen...

543
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:34,724
One gets confused by
what is infinitely small,

544
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,817
and what is infinitely large.

545
00:43:41,297 --> 00:43:42,773
The mind buckles...

546
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,158
the head aches...

547
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:52,942
Much more violently than
the impact of your fists.

548
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:54,282
gentlemen.

549
00:43:55,953 --> 00:43:57,848
So this is how it was?

550
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,514
This is how it was.

551
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,501
Nothing can compare with the
memories of childhood.

552
00:44:04,718 --> 00:44:06,504
And yours and mine of each others...

553
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:10,818
I think I began to love you because
I knew straight away you wouldn't...

554
00:44:10,938 --> 00:44:12,958
invade me,

555
00:44:13,078 --> 00:44:14,189
colonize me.

556
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:18,174
Not some kind of moral achievement
on your part, it's just that I...

557
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:21,656
suppose you simply exhausted
your prejudices on your wife.

558
00:44:21,776 --> 00:44:22,977
How penetrating.

559
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:29,188
Truly, I wouldn't have lived
as I have if I'd met you first.

560
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:33,552
I now look back on all those years
with bitter scepticism.

561
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:36,233
I'm ready to defect.

562
00:44:37,736 --> 00:44:38,614
It's a little late.

563
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:41,395
Aren't you rather letting yourself
down by saying that?

564
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,817
I thought you were bored and
disgusted by the idea of living

565
00:44:43,937 --> 00:44:45,863
with someone continuously.

566
00:44:52,677 --> 00:44:54,621
How you and father
would have fought.

567
00:45:09,815 --> 00:45:13,613
There's a terrific fire across the city,
the sky's red for miles.

568
00:45:14,675 --> 00:45:16,203
Are you still here?

569
00:45:17,908 --> 00:45:19,917
What are your opinions on adultery?

570
00:45:20,688 --> 00:45:23,671
Do you care about
the nature of things?

571
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:25,960
Have you got a philosophical bent?

572
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:27,760
Do you worry?

573
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:34,053
What do you think of
my wife's body?

574
00:45:34,173 --> 00:45:35,661
It isn't the point.

575
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,766
I beg your pardon?

576
00:45:38,377 --> 00:45:40,208
Let me put it this way...

577
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:43,027
It isn't the point.

578
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,602
Did you hear that old boy?

579
00:45:45,983 --> 00:45:47,960
She has a concise way
of putting things.

580
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,703
Well what do you make of it?

581
00:45:50,474 --> 00:45:52,857
What do you make of love?

582
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:56,289
How'd you like to run
away with her?

583
00:45:56,794 --> 00:45:58,836
There's no need to run anywhere.

584
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:01,903
I've already left you,
so why run?

585
00:46:02,316 --> 00:46:04,927
We can manage perfectly
well just as we are.

586
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:07,856
See if you can cope,
I'd be fascinated.

587
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:11,385
You will continue to exert
self-control I'm sure.

588
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:13,607
The chap's an enigma,

589
00:46:13,727 --> 00:46:15,217
he really is.

590
00:46:19,497 --> 00:46:22,728
She is an enterprising fuck
though, isn't she?

591
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:25,244
I'm always content where I am.

592
00:46:25,747 --> 00:46:30,557
My husband you see Kevin, Claude,
is committed to self control.

593
00:46:31,646 --> 00:46:34,243
He exaggerates of course,
it's a performance.

594
00:46:34,363 --> 00:46:37,574
If you knew him you'd realize
he has no emotions to control.

595
00:46:38,634 --> 00:46:40,760
My wife has turned your head.

596
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,273
Oh yes she has...

597
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,439
I can tell the signs.

598
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,754
Woodford! Don't go to sleep!

599
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,493
I know you have inner peace...

600
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:54,183
And you have inner stagnation.

601
00:46:55,368 --> 00:46:57,419
Childhood is shattering.

602
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:00,317
I can see that you must
have got off to a bad start.

603
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:04,754
But you've got more than your fair
share of inner peace, old boy.

604
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:07,829
You'll have to be put down.

605
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:13,890
"Like a mad dog" as they say.

606
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,342
Sonia!

607
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:24,865
Put him down at once.

608
00:47:37,782 --> 00:47:39,882
- Where's the lady?
- Going for a swim.

609
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:42,886
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- I get around.

610
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,426
Aren't you the famous footballer?

611
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:47,573
Or is it cricket?

612
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:50,598
Steady.

613
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:52,450
I believe I'm the affronted party.

614
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,274
After all it is your brother who's
screwing my wife, isn't it.

615
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:57,831
He's not screwing anybody,
isn't Kevin.

616
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:02,383
Do you spend very much time jogging
about town dressed like that?

617
00:48:03,393 --> 00:48:05,438
Oh, training are we?

618
00:48:05,558 --> 00:48:06,921
Big match coming on.

619
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,053
I'm very famous indeed, see.

620
00:48:09,755 --> 00:48:13,025
And an equally serious occupation
of mine is taking care of our Kevin.

621
00:48:13,145 --> 00:48:14,629
He needs it, he needs it...

622
00:48:14,749 --> 00:48:16,755
Our childhood Mr. Langham...

623
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,500
we was brought up like pigs.

624
00:48:20,624 --> 00:48:21,816
My goodness!

625
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:25,183
You do seem to be a very
serious sort of chap.

626
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:28,314
It's a fine game, football,
beautiful to watch.

627
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,807
Well, you know...

628
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:34,166
I mean as a general activity
it seems meaningless,

629
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:38,465
but the form, pattern,
is elegant.

630
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:41,874
If it is football...

631
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:44,121
Choreographically there's
plenty of poetry there.

632
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:45,434
Plenty, plenty...

633
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:48,626
Oh, when one gets hold
of the ball, and...

634
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:51,643
tickles it along...

635
00:48:57,384 --> 00:48:59,616
Can I do anything for you
famous footballer?

636
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:10,345
Ah, this'll never do.

637
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:13,084
Won't do at all!

638
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:18,476
Can't have people thumping
our poor old bloody Claude.

639
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:29,462
Can we...

640
00:49:32,629 --> 00:49:34,259
Oh, for Christ's sake.

641
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:38,298
The pains are banging in my neck
like sodding tom-toms.

642
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:41,778
Oh, is it the arteries?

643
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,244
Or the jugular...

644
00:49:46,372 --> 00:49:47,828
Going to burst?

645
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,366
Then spew out,

646
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:54,952
living, red juice.

647
00:50:14,836 --> 00:50:16,278
Helen?

648
00:50:16,882 --> 00:50:18,316
Molly?

649
00:50:19,104 --> 00:50:21,698
The pains are catching up with me.

650
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,432
In the end I shall call for morphine.

651
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,534
No hero, not heroic, never was...

652
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:32,593
Do you see Molly, they're taking
some of them away.

653
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,493
But not you my love.

654
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:43,329
No...

655
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,233
What a punctual fellow you are.

656
00:50:57,353 --> 00:50:58,591
Come on.

657
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:21,020
Miss Boon.

658
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,726
Ah Miss Boon, how erotic
you look this morning.

659
00:51:29,846 --> 00:51:31,775
This is my friend Woodford.

660
00:51:32,607 --> 00:51:34,395
He used to be in the army.

661
00:51:35,188 --> 00:51:38,789
But now he's nothing more,
nor less, than a failed astronaut.

662
00:51:45,322 --> 00:51:47,539
That's his, his brother Dave.

663
00:51:48,927 --> 00:51:50,576
The famous footballer.

664
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:55,894
What can I do for you
Mr. Langham and...

665
00:51:56,014 --> 00:51:57,305
or Mr. Woodford?

666
00:51:57,809 --> 00:51:59,140
Well you see...

667
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,561
frankly...

668
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:03,526
my wife is thinking of taking
him away with her.

669
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:06,475
He has to be taken otherwise
he'd never go.

670
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:10,191
He's never had the urge for...

671
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:11,423
Bangkok

672
00:52:11,543 --> 00:52:13,111
Venice

673
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:14,815
Tokyo

674
00:52:14,935 --> 00:52:16,772
any of those places
you and I would

675
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:19,244
side for.

676
00:52:20,712 --> 00:52:22,697
Woodford, sit down and
explain your problem!

677
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:28,793
Well...

678
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,840
It all started after his wife had
asked me out to lunch.

679
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:38,744
I'd just been acquitted of murder.

680
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,281
What's more...

681
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:45,745
I think that he and Sonia should
have a quiet, beautiful place

682
00:52:45,865 --> 00:52:48,048
where they can fuck,
night and day.

683
00:52:49,016 --> 00:52:50,641
A sort of backdrop
of a place...

684
00:52:50,761 --> 00:52:52,708
I don't even know
his wife, not really.

685
00:52:52,828 --> 00:52:56,864
Nonetheless, bundle him
out of the country we must

686
00:52:58,894 --> 00:53:00,443
before I shoot him.

687
00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:06,182
Do you approve of
violence Miss Boon?

688
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:08,495
Certainly not!

689
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:10,172
Neither do I.

690
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:12,019
It reeks of spontaneity.

691
00:53:12,707 --> 00:53:14,499
Come, come, young Buddha.

692
00:53:26,242 --> 00:53:27,365
Right...

693
00:53:27,485 --> 00:53:28,621
now...

694
00:53:30,084 --> 00:53:30,972
Yes...

695
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:34,352
Where was I?
In the travel agent...

696
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:43,079
In case there's a myocardial
infarction, but patient...

697
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:44,675
No...

698
00:53:47,634 --> 00:53:50,074
Jesus! That was a spear of fire.

699
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,640
So...

700
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:56,845
Dress the creature will you.

701
00:53:57,214 --> 00:53:58,781
What was that Mr. Langham?

702
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,340
Dress the creature!
Don't bugger about.

703
00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:03,920
He can't walk with my wife
dressed like that.

704
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,059
Yes, Mr. Langham.

705
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:09,538
Dress not the humble exterior clay
Mr. Jennings, but the man within.

706
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:12,317
Oh come, come, come.

707
00:54:12,437 --> 00:54:14,105
I have to leave for my
gunmaker by noon.

708
00:54:14,225 --> 00:54:17,226
Your father rang yesterday,
ordered a dozen shirts.

709
00:54:17,346 --> 00:54:18,276
Shirts?

710
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,377
He should be ordering shrouds.

711
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:27,894
