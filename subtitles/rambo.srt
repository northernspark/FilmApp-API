Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:06,649 --> 00:00:31,105
Thousands took to the streets
and thousands kill...

3
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:36,136
Many peaceful protesting monks have been
killed, some burnt alive and others drowned..

4
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:38,439
Foreign journalists have been shot and caned..

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,331
Thousands of villages have been destroyed.
Rape and torture are a daily occurrence.

6
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:45,255
In Burma there are more landmines,
than anywhere in the world.

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,110
Young men are bitten and forced into
the army. Many as young as 12 years old.

8
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:51,248
Beheadings and mutilations
are common.

9
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:56,329
The Karen people comprising mostly of poor Christian
farmers have been singled out for extermination.

10
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,949
The military government wants many of
the abundance resources on the Karen land.

11
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:05,340
The bloody military campaign against the Karen
people has been going on for almost 60 years.

12
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:08,546
The longest radical war in the world.

13
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:25,680
Ready. Send them out!

14
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,753
Move!

15
00:02:56,655 --> 00:02:58,218
Shoot them all!

16
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:56,413
OK.

17
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:32,914
Looks like dangerous work.

18
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,773
I am Michael Burnett.

19
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,015
Do you have some time to talk?

20
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,804
Won't take too long, I promise.

21
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,760
I was told it might be possible to
rent your boat. We like to do that.

22
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,018
Is that possible?

23
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,097
We need to get up river.

24
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,765
Where are you going?

25
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,704
Into Burma.

26
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,275
Burma is a war zone.

27
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,188
That's what people call it.

28
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,065
But it's more like genocide than war.

29
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:59,611
This will be my fifth trip in,

30
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:02,636
we are aware of all the risk.

31
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,807
I don't go that far north.

32
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,108
Let me explain our situation.

33
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:12,022
Our church is part of the Pan-Asia
ministry..

34
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,273
located in Colorado.

35
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:16,611
We are all volunteers, whom
around this time of the year,

36
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:20,052
bring in medical supplies,
medical attention..

37
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:24,188
prayer books and support to the
Karen tribe's people.

38
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:27,144
People say you know the river
better than anyone.

39
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,186
They lied.

40
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:31,107
What I am asking is, we compensate you...

41
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,880
for a few hours of your time..

42
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,487
to help change people's lives.

43
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:40,597
Are you bringing in any weapons?

44
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:42,527
Of course not.

45
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,934
You are not changing anything.

46
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:51,860
It's thinking like that,
that keeps the world the way it is.

47
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,112
F..k the world.

48
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:57,596
- Let's go
- Why?

49
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:58,847
He's not interested.

50
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:01,246
- Let me try.
- Sara...

51
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,914
It'll be an interesting trip going up there.

52
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:03,853
What do we have to lose?.

53
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:06,669
Let me try.

54
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:07,712
Sarah.

55
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:17,932
Hello?

56
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:23,043
I am Sarah Miller. Hope you don't
mind me coming back here.

57
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:26,484
The man you were talking to...

58
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,674
I wasn't talking to anybody.

59
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,330
Ok, the man that was talking to you..

60
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:36,600
asked if we could hire your boat
to go up river.

61
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:39,312
and you said no, why?

62
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:41,397
Can't help you out.

63
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:46,508
If you have some reasons,
mind if I heard them?

64
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:52,660
Go home.

65
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,362
Why did you come back?

66
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,179
Waiting for you.

67
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:37,435
I told you before,
I can't help you.

68
00:12:37,853 --> 00:12:39,939
We need to know why you
can't help these people.

69
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:41,503
We are here to make a difference.

70
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,006
We believe all lives are special.

71
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,327
Some lives, some no.

72
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,577
Really?

73
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:49,116
If everyone thought like you,
nothing will ever change.

74
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:49,742
Nothing will change.

75
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:51,895
Of course it does.
Nothing stays the same.

76
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:53,653
Value your life, it's a good one

77
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,373
It's what I am trying to do!

78
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:57,981
No, what you are trying to do
is change what is.

79
00:12:58,017 --> 00:13:00,275
And what is?

80
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,777
Go home.

81
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:09,244
Really.
Go home.

82
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,592
Maybe...

83
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:38,444
Maybe you lost your faith in people.

84
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:44,076
But you feel the same for something.
You must still care for something.

85
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,830
Maybe we can't change what it is,

86
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:54,922
But trying to save a life,
isn't wasting your life. Is it?

87
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:21,411
As bad as these people are,
they will eventually lose.

88
00:14:21,447 --> 00:14:24,435
They can't keep it up against a united front.

89
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:25,270
They can't!

90
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,380
Time alone will tell. In the meantime,
we just got to hold it together.

91
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:32,674
Just the other day...

92
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,551
Excuse me, Sara?

93
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,481
Where are you going?

94
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:38,306
To talk to him.

95
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:40,287
He'll probably want his privacy.

96
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,060
Michael, you shouldn't worry,
he's helping us.

97
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:43,538
He's being paid.

98
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:45,189
He didn't take anything.

99
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:55,514
Thank you again for doing this.

100
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,182
Really from all of us.

101
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,268
You never told us your name.

102
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,875
John.

103
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:04,691
Where are you from?

104
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,089
Arizona.

105
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,739
- Why did you leave?
- I got drafted in Vietnam.

106
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,408
And you just stayed?

107
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,328
It's complicated.

108
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:17,518
You have a family back home?

109
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:19,917
Father maybe.
I don't know.

110
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:26,174
Aren't you curious to see what
might have changed back home?

111
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,825
Don't have a reason for that.

112
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,186
Sara.

113
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,523
Because of you we going,
I'll approve it..

114
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,026
anytime you want to turn around...

115
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:43,799
...it is done.

116
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,510
Ok.

117
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,740
What is it?
Who are they?

118
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,305
Burmese pirates.

119
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:44,599
Everyone sit down,
don't make a sound.

120
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:49,605
- It's all right.
- Don't talk.

121
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,860
- Are there more of them?
- Maybe.

122
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:31,529
We will know?

123
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,032
We should keep going.
We made a commitment.

124
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:35,700
I ain't talking to you.

125
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:39,350
What do you want to do? - We are a
group here. They want to vote. Vote.

126
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:42,026
Sit down!

127
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,522
If it is money they want...

128
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:49,154
Nobody talks. Heads down!

129
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,287
What are you doing?

130
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:04,311
We come here to stop the killing.
Who are you to kill?

131
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:06,360
- Who are you?
- Let him go!

132
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:11,299
You want them to rape her
fifty times and cut her head off!

133
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,411
Who are you?

134
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:14,427
Who are any of you?

135
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:17,974
We are going back.

136
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,377
No. We shouldn't go back!

137
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:28,574
Let go.

138
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,530
- What are you doing?
- We are so close!

139
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,580
What has happened here is horrible...

140
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:37,996
But what the people in there are
being killed like this every day.

141
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:43,732
Michael this was your idea.
We made a commitment.

142
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:46,756
I know you don't believe
in what we are doing,

143
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,425
But it is our lives.

144
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:49,885
Our choice.

145
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,474
You are not going to change anything.

146
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:58,191
Please

147
00:20:58,228 --> 00:20:59,897
Please John.

148
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:01,879
Please

149
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:17,730
Go sit down.

150
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:19,365
We are taking the overland route on the way
back, so there is no need to wait around.

151
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:22,806
I have to report this.

152
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:25,934
I know you think what you did is right,..

153
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,020
but taking a life is never right.

154
00:22:43,976 --> 00:22:46,480
I don't know what to say.

155
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:50,755
Maybe you shouldn't say anything.
Should you? Good Luck.

156
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,934
KLAW KBE LO LANDSBYEN.

157
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,051
Open your mouth.

158
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,533
We signify your faith with
this little flower, ok?

159
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:49,679
Hey dear. Can you hand
over the bandages?

160
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:15,751
Get out of here!
What about them?  Go on, take them!

161
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,524
......calling Raven.

162
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:54,236
Over...

163
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:55,696
What am I?

164
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,407
We made you this way.
You are a full blooded combat soldier.

165
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,119
Talk to me Johnny!

166
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:02,438
You don't just turn it off!

167
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:07,272
- It's over!
- Nothing is over!

168
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:16,345
Aren't you curious how things
might have changed back home?

169
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,228
You have done enough damage!

170
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:22,706
You will always be tearing away soldier..

171
00:31:23,124 --> 00:31:25,277
till you come to terms with what you are.

172
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:28,025
So you are just going to stay here forever?

173
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:31,989
John Rambo!

174
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:34,387
John.

175
00:31:35,116 --> 00:31:36,785
John Rambo.

176
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,385
My name is Arthur Marsh.

177
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:55,244
Pastor of Christ Church Colorado.

178
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,539
I need to talk with you.

179
00:31:57,956 --> 00:32:02,023
It is very important, otherwise
I won't come here like this.

180
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:07,133
The morning of the day the group left,..

181
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,808
Michael Burnet notified me...

182
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,869
that they were traveling through this location.

183
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,145
What happened?

184
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,814
No one knows exactly.

185
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:22,255
They will supposed to return 10 days ago,
but they never came back.

186
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:25,592
I requested help from the embassy,
but they can't help.

187
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,469
Not in Burma and not in time.

188
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:30,077
How do you know they are alive?.

189
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:34,248
Because we have been in contact
with the Karen freedom fighters,

190
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:37,481
who say they think they know
where they were taken.

191
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:42,069
I was given the name of an ex-military
American local from the embassy..

192
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:45,929
who put me in touch with men who say they
have experience in this part of the world.

193
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:46,763
Mercenaries?

194
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:49,996
Yes.

195
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:52,671
I don't have any other choice.

196
00:32:52,707 --> 00:32:56,879
You know the exact spot.
We need you to take these men,

197
00:32:56,915 --> 00:33:00,216
to where you let our people off.

198
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,884
When are they ready to leave?

199
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:04,179
When you are.

200
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,411
You know what you are.

201
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:27,957
What you are made off.

202
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:32,024
War is in your blood.

203
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,361
Don't fight it.

204
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:39,950
Did you kill for your country?

205
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,809
Did you kill for yourself?

206
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:48,814
God is never going to make that go away.

207
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:56,219
When you are pushed...

208
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:03,206
Killing is as easy as breathing.

209
00:34:31,051 --> 00:34:33,293
Look at this f..king place!

210
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,527
Only a f..king ape would live here?

211
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:37,725
What am I doing here?

212
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:40,541
Hey, knock that shit off!

213
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:42,382
And you don't like the arts?

214
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,921
And you don't like the shit.
I like your sister, Diaz.

215
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:46,590
She got a thing for retards.

216
00:34:46,694 --> 00:34:48,363
Hey boatman!

217
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,908
How much longer in this ancient piece of shit?

218
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:58,792
What did the reverent say?

219
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,086
Something about his flock went missing.

220
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,893
I said look mate, that is what you get
when you're trespassing into Burma.

221
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:08,454
That's what you get, when you go around
sniffing other people's garbage.

222
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:12,662
You know those generals in there are making millions,
cranking up more than anyone in this planet.

223
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:13,600
Bullshit!

224
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:16,834
Millions, Moron. How do you
think they paid for that shit all ?

225
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,667
Try to read the papers
instead of sticking under it.

226
00:35:19,704 --> 00:35:22,465
The general is the biggest junkies
of all of them.

227
00:35:22,502 --> 00:35:24,098
It's noble Louis..

228
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:28,305
You are? Those people going in
without weapons.

229
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,600
Just books and medicine.

230
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:32,164
It's noble.

231
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:33,483
Ok, schoolboy!

232
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,710
You stick your nose in other people's
business, you get f..k up...

233
00:35:35,746 --> 00:35:37,274
or you are dead.

234
00:35:37,587 --> 00:35:40,351
The only reason I am doing this
is for an ex-wife and 3 kids.

235
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:43,115
and after the shit is over, you can
shove that right up your ass.

236
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:45,268
- Try to think careful, mate!
- Back off!

237
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:47,911
And you, I don't want to die of old age
before I get there. So move.

238
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:57,819
You said something?

239
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:28,376
S.P.D.C. LET INFANTERY BATTALION 360

240
00:37:56,812 --> 00:38:03,278
Is it me? Or is it the air coming in
smelling like some wet dog?

241
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:08,388
For f..k sake, I can swim faster than this.

242
00:38:08,492 --> 00:38:11,621
- Am I right?
- We dead.

243
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:17,044
Chop, chop. The quicker we are there,
the quicker we get back.

244
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,553
Those idiots.

245
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,749
They come here..

246
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:29,663
start all the trouble...

247
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:34,773
... expecting the whole world to work
like their old neighbours. Well it doesn't..

248
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:39,257
So they send in the devil...

249
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:42,490
... to do god's work.
Ironic isn't it?

250
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,975
Am I boring you man?

251
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:52,084
Is it the trip? It's got you nervous?

252
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:53,959
Because we..

253
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:56,463
...we really appreciate the action.
You know what I mean?

254
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:59,384
Look at me in the eyes if
you know what I am saying.

255
00:39:01,784 --> 00:39:03,869
Oh dear..

256
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:07,311
You are really an uptight master,
aren't you?

257
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:11,535
You can drop the act in your stare.

258
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:13,776
I have seen it all before.

259
00:39:14,507 --> 00:39:16,384
I am not impressed.

260
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:30,619
He's old school, SAS.

261
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:34,113
The first rate soldier to be
told to go maniac.

262
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,763
They call him schoolboy.

263
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:40,996
The name stuck with him since.

264
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:45,064
The name he start calling me
no matter how many people I shoot.

265
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:15,620
What do you want from us?

266
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:05,365
One man and a kid in a chicken coop.

267
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:07,727
This sort of rebel they put up.

268
00:41:07,764 --> 00:41:11,831
I am not liking it You are in a jungle,
there is nothing to like.

269
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:13,359
How are you doing?

270
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:16,107
My name is Bieth, this is Tha.

271
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:17,463
This is it?

272
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:19,617
What's with the kid?

273
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:24,033
He's a good tracker.
We don't need a tracker. We need a guide.

274
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:25,701
You know the exact location right?

275
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:27,474
10 km west.

276
00:41:27,996 --> 00:41:30,864
To north 6 km walk.
- How many soldiers?

277
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,382
- 100 maybe.
- 100?

278
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,677
Heard what he said.
- More soldiers coming tomorrow.

279
00:41:35,713 --> 00:41:38,738
I know I'm just a white trash
full of blanks, but I can count.

280
00:41:38,842 --> 00:41:40,928
...stop f..king with the 100 strong.
Alright, alright!

281
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:43,081
Let's get this straight.

282
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:46,142
We don't engage anybody.
If we can extract these people, good.

283
00:41:46,351 --> 00:41:49,062
It's in, out, clean, or we go off.

284
00:41:49,062 --> 00:41:51,461
Somebody want to tell me
what the boatman is doing?

285
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:55,282
Why don't you wait with the boat.

286
00:41:55,632 --> 00:41:59,074
- My man will stay with the boat.
- Your boat, you stay here.

287
00:41:59,491 --> 00:42:00,638
I won't slow you down.

288
00:42:00,638 --> 00:42:03,245
No, you won't.
It's not a nature hunt?

289
00:42:03,348 --> 00:42:06,060
You can believe that.
He can be with me at the back.

290
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:09,294
He stays here. He's the boatman.
He stays with the boat.

291
00:42:09,503 --> 00:42:11,067
Only a white man with a f..king dick.

292
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:14,612
Who has the explosives?

293
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:16,385
I've got some C4.

294
00:42:17,116 --> 00:42:20,245
- I’ve got a claymore.
- Alright.

295
00:42:20,593 --> 00:42:24,103
Let's go on with it.
Come on, move.

296
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:08,739
What is that?  ### bomb.
English dropped it in World War II.

297
00:43:57,336 --> 00:44:00,674
Your people taken from here.

298
00:44:02,238 --> 00:44:04,324
In my life, I've seen some shit.

299
00:44:05,888 --> 00:44:09,434
But I've seen no shit like this.

300
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,403
Check it out!

301
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:29,249
All these commies, kill everything,
People are dead here as warning.

302
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:38,009
Mines, everywhere.

303
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,929
Watch where you are walking.

304
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:57,824
- Alright let's move on.
- To what?

305
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:02,308
They even kill the dogs.
Those people are dead. I'm with Kenji.

306
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:04,081
At least to have a look see.

307
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:07,105
Check it out.
I'm with you.

308
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,461
Check what? They are 100 strong.

309
00:45:08,566 --> 00:45:13,676
We told the man's money.
Hey, calm down.

310
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:19,270
We got to see what is wrong.

311
00:45:19,307 --> 00:45:24,313
If anything is wrong, anything at all,
we leave. Alright?

312
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:26,816
Yes.

313
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:30,049
I order.

314
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:33,491
Good.
This way.

315
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:41,312
- Army!
- Go!

316
00:46:03,629 --> 00:46:05,715
I'm going to fire at them.

317
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,617
No, if they don't make it back from where
the hell they came from, they'll be on to us.

318
00:48:00,016 --> 00:48:03,353
Who are you boatman?
- Let's move. - Move?

319
00:48:03,562 --> 00:48:05,856
They are going to come after us,
when these guys don't show up.

320
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:07,837
We don't need this shit.
We are going back to the boat.

321
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:20,247
Any of you boys want to shoot,
now is the time.

322
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:30,885
Any reason one of us just
doesn't want to surprise us.

323
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:32,658
But this is what we do.

324
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:35,473
Who we are.

325
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:39,854
Live for nothing.

326
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,400
Or die for something.

327
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:49,031
Your call!

328
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,829
What's your call?
Let's move.

329
00:49:38,529 --> 00:49:43,014
Once Schoolboy's on the tower, we've
got 15 mins. Set your watches to 1:45.

330
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,645
And we won't wait for anybody.

331
00:49:44,683 --> 00:49:49,270
We meet at the base of the tower.
We don't meet up there, we f..ked.

332
00:49:51,147 --> 00:49:53,233
All set?
Set!

333
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,548
Go!

334
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,829
Go!

335
00:51:27,815 --> 00:51:28,858
Go!

336
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,797
Don't talk. Hear me out.

337
00:53:06,778 --> 00:53:07,785
Where is the girl?

338
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:11,574
She's over there.
Go untie him. I'll be back again.

339
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:38,376
Here!

340
00:53:41,295 --> 00:53:44,632
There's two in the cage.
Near the pitch. Get them.

341
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:20,010
Come on!

342
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,271
Let's move!

343
00:58:19,308 --> 00:58:20,767
Where is the boatman?
And Sarah.

344
00:58:20,871 --> 00:58:22,853
15 minutes. That's the deal.
We're leaving.

345
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,485
Let's go!
5 more minutes.

346
00:58:24,522 --> 00:58:25,773
Bullshit!
He knew the deal.

347
00:58:25,774 --> 00:58:27,652
If we're getting away,
we f..king leave together!

348
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,005
Your live.
Let's go!

349
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,362
Not without her!

350
00:58:33,907 --> 00:58:36,827
Who do you think save your life?
We did.

351
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,268
Get up!

352
01:01:25,553 --> 01:01:27,638
- You got us covered?
- Yes.

353
01:01:28,577 --> 01:01:30,663
Why did you come back?
Why did you do?

354
01:01:33,479 --> 01:01:35,565
This way.

355
01:03:13,692 --> 01:03:16,821
My leg.
Hold still!

356
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:29,752
Shut up.
We got you. We're getting you out.

357
01:03:30,586 --> 01:03:32,740
His leg is broken!

358
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:37,641
Where is the guide?
He's gone!

359
01:03:37,677 --> 01:03:39,762
- We're not going to make it to the river with him.
- Will you shut up.

360
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:41,639
Untie his lace.
Take of his boot.

361
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:45,394
No! Leave his boot on.

362
01:03:46,229 --> 01:03:48,731
....I need a knife.

363
01:03:54,675 --> 01:03:56,239
- Is he going to make it?
- I don't know. Make him stretch.

364
01:03:56,276 --> 01:03:58,221
Spread out!

365
01:04:22,727 --> 01:04:24,812
Take the point.

366
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:45,878
Hear that?
They're tracking us.

367
01:04:49,943 --> 01:04:52,446
- Turn around.
- What are you doing?

368
01:04:56,201 --> 01:05:00,023
I want you two to go to the river.
The boat is waiting.

369
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,917
It's out there.
You can follow the shore line.

370
01:05:03,953 --> 01:05:07,150
- What about you?
- I'll be alright.

371
01:05:07,254 --> 01:05:08,923
Give me the claymine.

372
01:05:10,383 --> 01:05:11,842
- Fire of a shot.
- What?

373
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:14,659
Fire off a shot!

374
01:05:23,418 --> 01:05:25,503
Go! Go!

375
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:15,898
Let's move.

376
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:40,196
- Wait.
- Where are they?

377
01:08:46,036 --> 01:08:49,998
- Son of a bitch!
- Look

378
01:08:53,648 --> 01:08:55,837
Oh God!

379
01:09:05,745 --> 01:09:08,143
Oh damn it!

380
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:44,224
F..k you!

381
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:45,268
Come on to me, you lady boy!

382
01:10:04,977 --> 01:10:08,001
What did we do?
We did nothing.

383
01:10:38,241 --> 01:10:42,413
What are we going to do?
We can't do anything.

384
01:13:53,664 --> 01:13:55,541
Karen rebels.

385
01:16:46,874 --> 01:16:48,647
Michael!

386
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:53,653
Michael!

387
01:17:30,363 --> 01:17:32,345
Michael!

388
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:21,030
