{2482}{2582}<i>[ Woman ] Last night</i>|<i>I dreamt I went to Manderley again.</i>
{2580}{2690}<i>It seemed to me I stood by the</i>|<i>iron gate leading to the drive,</i>
{2690}{2750}<i>and for a while</i>|<i>I could not enter...</i>
{2750}{2802}<i>for the way was barred to me.</i>
{2805}{2870}<i>Then, like all dreamers,</i>
{2870}{2960}<i>I was possessed of a sudden</i>|<i>with supernatural powers...</i>
{2958}{3052}<i>and passed like a spirit</i>|<i>through the barrier before me.</i>
{3052}{3125}<i>The drive wound away</i>|<i>in front of me,</i>
{3125}{3208}<i>twisting and turning</i>|<i>as it had always done.</i>
{3208}{3328}<i>But as I advanced, I was aware</i>|<i>that a change had come upon it.</i>
{3328}{3390}<i>Nature had come</i>|<i>into her own again,</i>
{3390}{3472}<i>and little by little</i>|<i>had encroached upon the drive...</i>
{3475}{3550}<i>with long, tenacious fiingers.</i>
{3595}{3722}<i>On and on wound the poor thread</i>|<i>that had once been our drive,</i>
{3718}{3810}<i>and fiinally</i>|<i>there was Manderley.</i>
{3810}{3900}<i>Manderley--</i>|<i>secretive and silent.</i>
{3898}{3998}<i>Time could not mar the perfect</i>|<i>symmetry of those walls.</i>
{3998}{4085}<i>Moonlight can play</i>|<i>odd tricks upon the fancy,</i>
{4082}{4195}<i>and suddenly it seemed to me that light</i>|<i>came from the windows.</i>
{4262}{4330}<i>And then a cloud</i>|<i>came upon the moon...</i>
{4332}{4442}<i>and hovered an instant</i>|<i>like a dark hand before a face.</i>
{4440}{4525}<i>The illusion went with it.</i>
{4528}{4612}<i>I looked upon</i>|<i>a desolate shell...</i>
{4610}{4745}<i>with no whisper of the past</i>|<i>about its staring walls.</i>
{4742}{4812}<i>We can never</i>|<i>go back to Manderley again.</i>
{4812}{4860}<i>That much is certain.</i>
{4860}{4922}<i>But sometimes in my dreams...</i>
{4922}{5010}<i>I do go back to the strange</i>|<i>days of my life...</i>
{5008}{5098}<i>which began for me</i>|<i>in the South of France.</i>
{5920}{5988}<i>No! Stop!</i>
{5988}{6072}What the devil|are you shouting about ?
{6072}{6168}Who are you ?|What are you staring at ?
{6168}{6255}I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.|But I, I only thought--
{6252}{6322}Oh, you did, did you ?|Well, what are you doing here ?
{6322}{6370}I was only walking.
{6370}{6458}Well, get on with your walking.|Don't hang about here screaming.
{7058}{7125}I'll never come to Monte Carlo|out of season again.
{7125}{7205}Not a single well-known|personality in the hotel.
{7205}{7318}Stone cold ! Waiter.|G<i>arcon.</i> Call him.
{7315}{7365}Tell him to get me some--
{7365}{7498}<i>Why, it</i>'<i>s Ma</i>x <i>de Winter.</i>|<i>How do you do ?</i>
{7592}{7650}- How do you do ?|- I'm Edith Van Hopper.
{7650}{7702}It's so nice|to run into you here,
{7702}{7785}just when I was beginning to despair of|fiinding any old friends here in Monte.
{7785}{7842}But do sit down|and have some coffee.
{7842}{7930}Mr. de Winter is having coffee with me.|Ask that stupid waiter for another cup.
{7930}{8048}I'm afraid I must contradict you.|You shall both have coffee with me.
{8045}{8098}- G<i>arcon.</i> Coffee, please.|<i>- Oui, monsieur.</i>
{8098}{8145}- A cigarette ?|- No, thank you.
{8145}{8212}You know, I recognized you|just as soon as you came in,
{8212}{8305}though I haven't seen you since|that night at the casino at Palm Beach.
{8302}{8400}Perhaps you don't remember|an old woman like me.|Are you playing the tables much here ?
{8402}{8472}No, I'm afraid that sort of thing|ceased to amuse me years ago.
{8470}{8532}I can well understand that.|As for me,
{8532}{8610}if I had a home like Manderley,|I should certainly never come to Monte.
{8610}{8730}<i>It</i>'<i>s one of the biggest places</i>|<i>in that part of the country, and</i>|<i>you can</i>'<i>t beat it for beauty.</i>
{8728}{8818}What do you think of Monte Carlo ?|Or don't you think of it at all ?
{8815}{8868}Oh, well,|I think it's rather artifiicial.
{8870}{8938}She's spoiled, Mr. de Winter.|That's her trouble.
{8935}{9002}Most girls would give their eyes|for a chance to see Monte.
{9002}{9065}Wouldn't that rather|defeat the purpose ?
{9065}{9148}Now that we've found each other again,|I hope I shall see something of you.
{9150}{9250}<i>You must come</i>|<i>and have a drink in my suite.</i>|<i>I hope they</i>'<i>ve given you a good room.</i>
{9248}{9328}<i>The place is empty. So if you</i>'<i>re</i>|<i>uncomfortable, mind you, make a fuss.</i>
{9328}{9388}Your valet has unpacked for you,|I suppose ?
{9388}{9455}I'm afraid I don't possess one.|Perhaps you'd like to do it for me ?
{9455}{9550}Well, I, I hardly think--
{9548}{9640}Perhaps you could make|yourself useful to Mr. de Winter|if he wants anything done.
{9638}{9690}You're a capable child in many ways.
{9692}{9765}That's a charming suggestion,|but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto:
{9762}{9818}'' He travels fastest|who travels alone.''
{9818}{9878}Perhaps you've not heard of it.|Good night.
{9878}{9940}What do you make of that ?
{9942}{10032}<i>Do you suppose that sudden departure</i>|<i>was intended to be funny?</i>
{10032}{10090}Come, don't sit there gawking.|Let's go upstairs.
{10090}{10142}- Have you got the key ?|- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
{10142}{10215}I remember when I was younger|there was a well-known writer...
{10215}{10290}who used to dart down the back|way whenever he saw me coming.
{10288}{10375}I suppose he was in love with me|and wasn't quite sure of himself.
{10375}{10435}Well, <i>c</i>'<i>est la vie.</i>
{10435}{10532}By the way, my dear,|don't think that I mean to be unkind,
{10530}{10605}but you were just a teeny, weeny bit|forward with Mr. de Winter.
{10605}{10658}Your effort to enter|the conversation...
{10658}{10715}quite embarrassed me,|and I'm sure it did him.
{10715}{10790}Men loathe that sort of thing.|Oh, come. Don't sulk.
{10792}{10868}After all, I am responsible|for your behavior here.
{10868}{10940}Perhaps he didn't notice it.|Poor thing !
{10938}{11012}I suppose he just can't|get over his wife's death.
{11012}{11080}They say he simply adored her.
{11478}{11542}<i>Oui.</i>|[ Speaking French ]
{11542}{11618}Oh ! How awkward of me.
{11618}{11690}<i>What a stupid thing to do.</i>|<i>Oh, I</i>'<i>m so sorry.</i>
{11690}{11748}<i>Please don</i>'<i>t bother.</i>|<i>It doesn</i>'<i>t really matter.</i>
{11748}{11818}Leave that. Leave that.|Go and lay another place at my table.
{11815}{11888}- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.|- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.
{11888}{11955}- Why not ?|- Oh, please don't be polite.|It's very kind of you,
{11955}{12025}- but I'll be all right if|they just change the cloth.|- I wasn't being polite.
{12025}{12122}I should have asked you to have|lunch with me even if you hadn't|upset the vase so clumsily.
{12120}{12198}Come along. We needn't talk to|each other if we don't feel like it.
{12198}{12245}Thank you very much.
{12335}{12405}Oh, I'll just ha-have|s-some scrambled eggs.
{12405}{12455}<i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>
{12492}{12540}What's happened to your friend ?
{12540}{12588}Oh, she's ill in bed with a cold.
{12588}{12665}I'm sorry|I was so rude to you yesterday.
{12665}{12755}The only excuse I can offer is that I've|become boorish through living alone.
{12752}{12820}You weren't really.|You simply wanted to be alone, and--
{12820}{12920}Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper|a friend of yours or just a relation ?
{12920}{12998}No, she's my employer.|I'm what is known as a paid companion.
{12995}{13050}I didn't know companionship|could be bought.
{13050}{13102}I looked up the word ''companion''|in the dictionary once.
{13102}{13152}It said,|''a friend of the bosom.''
{13155}{13208}[ Chuckles ]|I don't envy you the privilege.
{13208}{13292}Oh, she's very kind, really,|and I have to earn my living.
{13290}{13382}-Haven't you any family ?|-No, my mother died years and years ago,
{13382}{13450}and then there was only my father.
{13450}{13538}And he died last summer,|and then I took this job.
{13535}{13605}- How rotten for you.|- Yes, it was rather,
{13605}{13672}because, you see,|we got on so well together.
{13672}{13720}You and your father ?
{13720}{13768}Yes. He was a lovely person--|very unusual.
{13768}{13818}- What was he ?|- A painter.
{13818}{13878}- Ah. Was he a good one ?|- Well, I thought so.
{13880}{13940}But people didn't understand him.
{13940}{13992}Yes, that's often the trouble.
{13992}{14078}He painted trees.|At least it was one tree.
{14078}{14148}You mean he painted the same|tree over and over again ?
{14148}{14230}Yes. You see, he had a theory that|if you should fiind one perfect thing...
{14228}{14288}or place or person,|you should stick to it.
{14288}{14335}Do you think that's very silly ?
{14335}{14395}Not at all.|I'm a fiirm believer in that myself.
{14395}{14475}And what did you fiind|to do with yourself|while he was painting his tree ?
{14475}{14552}Oh, I sat with him and I sketched|a little. I don't do it well, though.
{14552}{14612}-You're going sketching this afternoon ?|-Yes.
{14612}{14660}- Where ?|- I haven't made up my mind.
{14660}{14735}- I'll drive you somewhere in the car.|- Oh, no, please. I didn't mean--
{14735}{14808}Oh, nonsense.|Finish up that mess and we'll get along.
{14805}{14878}Thank you. It's very kind of you,|but I'm not very hungry.
{14878}{14952}Oh, come on.|Eat it up like a good girl.
{15188}{15280}You're taking|long enough for that sketch.|I expect a really fiine work of art.
{15278}{15342}Oh, no, don't look at it.|It's not nearly good enough.
{15342}{15390}But it can't be|as bad as all that.
{15390}{15438}Now, don't rub it all out.|Let me look at it fiirst.
{15440}{15505}- It's the perspective.|I never can get it right.|- Let me see.
{15502}{15560}Oh, dear.|Tell me, is it the perspective...
{15560}{15628}<i>that gives my nose that</i>|<i>curious twist in the middle ?</i>
{15628}{15692}- Well, you're not|a very easy subject to sketch.|- No ?
{15692}{15770}- Your expression|keeps changing all the time.|- Does it ?
{15770}{15842}Well, I'd concentrate on the view|instead if I were you.
{15842}{15895}Much more worthwhile.
{15895}{15985}It rather reminds me of our coastline|at home. Do you know Cornwall at all ?
{15982}{16055}Yes. I went there once|with my father on holiday.
{16055}{16140}I was in a shop once,|and I saw a postcard...
{16140}{16205}with a beautiful house on it,|right by the sea.
{16205}{16298}And I asked whose house it was, and|the old lady said, ''That's Manderley.''
{16295}{16365}- I felt ashamed for not knowing.|<i>- Manderley is beautiful.</i>
{16365}{16488}To me, it's just the place|where I was born...
{16485}{16548}and have lived in all my life.
{16548}{16622}But now, I don't suppose|I shall ever see it again.
{16802}{16902}We're lucky not to be home|during the bad weather, aren't we ?
{16902}{16950}Hmm.
{16950}{17062}I can't ever remember enjoying swimming|in England untilJune, can you ?
{17120}{17192}The water's so warm here|that I could stay in all day.
{17192}{17288}There's a dangerous undertow, and|there was a man drowned here last year.
{17328}{17398}<i>I never have any fear</i>|<i>of drowning, have you ?</i>
{17558}{17605}Come, I'll take you home.
{17945}{18052}<i>[ Mrs. Van Hopper ]</i>|<i>Oh,yes. I know Mr. de Winter well.</i>|<i>I knew his wife too.</i>
{18050}{18125}Before she married, she was the|beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.
{18125}{18195}She was drowned, poor dear,|while she was sailing near Manderley.
{18195}{18265}<i>He never talks about it,</i>|<i>of course, but he</i>'<i>s a broken man.</i>
{18262}{18335}I suppose I'd better have it.|Wretched stuff!
{18335}{18395}Give me a chocolate, quick !
{18395}{18450}Oh, there you are.|It's about time.
{18450}{18522}Hurry up.|I want to play some rummy.

{18970}{19025}<i>But he</i>'<i>s a broken man.</i>
{19070}{19130}<i>- Bonjour.</i>|- Well, where are you going ?
{19128}{19195}-Oh, I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.|-I see.
{19195}{19275}I suppose you've had a look at the pro,|and he's desperately handsome...
{19272}{19348}and you've conceived|a schoolgirl crush on him.
{19348}{19410}All right, go ahead.|Make the most of it.
{19460}{19510}<i>- Off duty?</i>|- Oh, yes.
{19512}{19588}Mrs. Van Hopper's cold has turned|into flu, so she's got a trained nurse.
{19588}{19662}- I'm sorry for the nurse.|You keen on tennis ?|- No, not particularly.
{19662}{19735}That's good.|We'll go for a drive.
{20185}{20252}Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper.|How are you feeling ?
{20252}{20330}You got on rather well with him,|didn't you ?
{20328}{20402}That pro must have been|teaching you other things than tennis.
{20438}{20505}Hurry up.|I want you to make some calls.
{20505}{20578}I wonder if Mr. de Winter|is still in the hotel.
{21852}{21900}May I go now ?
{21900}{21980}For the number of lessons you've had,|you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.
{21980}{22040}But this will be your last,|so make the most of it.
{22040}{22108}The trouble is, with me laid up|like this, you haven't had enough to do.
{22108}{22155}But I'm getting rid of that nurse today,
{22155}{22202}and from now on|you'll stick to your job.
{22202}{22255}Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.
{22298}{22358}- Nurse !|<i>- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper?</i>
{22358}{22452}Are you absolutely sure you left|those messages for Mr. de Winter ?
{22450}{22518}- Why, yes, madame.|- I simply can't believe it.
{22518}{22580}He would most certainly|have called me back.
{22580}{22665}Oh, well. Poor boy.|I simply hate to see him so alone.
{22830}{22902}You know, I, I wish there|could be an invention...
{22900}{22985}that bottled up the memory|like perfume.
{22985}{23040}And it never faded,|never got stale.
{23040}{23098}Then whenever I wanted to,|I could uncork the bottle...
{23098}{23150}and live the memory|all over again.
{23150}{23215}And what particular moment|would you want to keep ?
{23215}{23285}Oh, all of them,|all these last few days.
{23285}{23398}I feel as though I'd, I'd collected|a whole shelf full of bottles.
{23395}{23482}Sometimes, you know, those|little bottles contain demons...
{23480}{23540}that have a way|of popping out at you...
{23540}{23600}just as you're trying|most desperately to forget.
{23852}{23908}Stop biting your nails.
{23908}{23978}Oh, I wish I were a woman of 36,
{23978}{24050}dressed in black satin,|with a string of pearls.
{24050}{24118}[ Laughing ] You wouldn't be here|with me if you were.
{24178}{24275}Would you please tell me, Mr. de Winter,|why you asked me to come out with you ?
{24272}{24335}Oh, it's obvious|that you want to be kind,

{24735}{24808}But if you think I just asked|you out of kindness or charity,
{24810}{24878}you can leave the car now|and fiind your own way home.

{127032}{127142}They sent a diver down.|He found another boat.
{127140}{127225}Yes, I know. Frank told me.|Rebecca's boat.
{127225}{127305}Oh, it's terrible for you.|I'm so sorry.
{127302}{127370}The diver made another discovery.
{127370}{127448}He broke one of the ports|and looked into the cabin.
{127480}{127535}There was a body in there.
{127535}{127588}Then she wasn't alone.

{131752}{131818}enchanted by her, as everyone was.
{131818}{131932}And when I was married, I was told|I was the luckiest man in the world.
{132000}{132060}She was so lovely,

{132305}{132382}And I believed them, completely.
{132418}{132492}But I never had|a moment's happiness with her.
{132492}{132560}She was incapable of love...

{132752}{132865}Do you remember that cliff|where you fiirst saw me in Monte Carlo ?
{132865}{132948}Well, I went there with Rebecca|on our honeymoon.
{132948}{133015}That was where|I found out about her.
{133015}{133085}Four days|after we were married.
{133088}{133148}She stood there laughing,
{133150}{133210}her black hair|blowing in the wind,

{133285}{133332}Everything.

{135835}{135920}She took a flat in London,|and she'd stay away for days at a time.

{139400}{139475}She looked almost triumphant.
{139512}{139615}Then she started|toward me again, smiling.

{140680}{140740}I put her in the cabin.
{140740}{140808}When the boat seemed a safe distance|from the shore, I took a spike...
{140808}{140880}and drove it again and again|through the planking of the hull.

{141520}{141568}We must explain it.

{151375}{151445}<i>That</i>'<i>s right, that</i>'<i>s right.</i>|<i>Now, we want you to tell us...</i>
{151445}{151518}<i>whether you were on the shore</i>|<i>that last night she went sailing.</i>
{151515}{151572}- Eh ?|- Were you on the shore...
{151575}{151648}that last night she went out,|when she didn't come back ?
{151645}{151748}I didn't see nothin'.|I don't want to go to the asylum.
{151748}{151802}Them cruel folks there.
{151805}{151862}Now, nobody's going|to send you to the asylum.
{151862}{151925}All we want you to do|is tell us what you saw.
{151925}{151965}I didn't see nothin'.
{151965}{152080}<i>Come, come. Did you see Mrs. de Winter</i>|<i>get into her boat that last night ?</i>
{152078}{152210}I don't know nothin'.|I don't want to go to the asylum.
{152282}{152340}- Very well, you may go.|- Eh ?
{152340}{152405}You may go now.
{152408}{152502}<i>Mr. Tabb, would you</i>|<i>step forward, please ?</i>
{152575}{152680}The evidence you give will|be the truth, the whole truth|and nothing but the truth ?
{152680}{152752}I do, so help me God.
{152750}{152842}The late Mrs. de Winter|used to send her boat to your|shipyard for reconditioning.
{152842}{152912}- That's right, sir.|<i>- Can you remember any occasion...</i>
{152912}{152980}<i>- when she had any sort</i>|<i>of accident with the boat ?</i>|<i>- No, sir.</i>
{152980}{153028}<i>I often said Mrs. de Winter</i>|<i>was a born sailor.</i>
{153028}{153098}Now, when Mrs. de Winter|went below, as is supposed,
{153098}{153148}and a sudden gust of wind|came down,
{153148}{153218}that would be enough to capsize|the boat, wouldn't it ?
{153218}{153298}Excuse me, sir, but there's|a little more to it than that.
{153295}{153378}<i>- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb ?</i>|- I mean, sir, the seacocks.
{153378}{153432}<i>- What are the seacocks ?</i>|<i>-Seacock--</i>
{153432}{153550}<i>Oh, well, the seacocks</i>|<i>are the valves to drain out the boat,</i>
{153548}{153660}and they're always kept|tight closed when you're afloat.
{153658}{153695}<i>Yes ?</i>
{153698}{153780}Well, yesterday when I examined|that boat, I found they'd been opened.
{153780}{153858}- What could be the reason for that ?|-Just this.
{153858}{153955}That's what flooded the boat|and sunk her.
{153952}{154040}<i>- Are you implying--</i>|<i>- That boat never capsized at all.</i>
{154038}{154108}I know it's a terrible|thing to say, sir,
{154108}{154190}but in my opinion,|she was scuttled.
{154190}{154240}[ Murmuring ]
{154240}{154322}- And there's them 'oles.|- What holes ?
{154325}{154395}- In her planking.|- What are you talking about ?
{154392}{154480}<i>Of course, that boat</i>'<i>s been</i>|<i>underwater for over a year,</i>
{154480}{154560}<i>and the tide</i>'<i>s been knocking her</i>|<i>against the ridge,</i>
{154560}{154660}but it seemed to me the 'oles looked|as if she'd made 'em from the inside.
{154700}{154772}Then you believe she must have|done it deliberately ?
{154772}{154870}Couldn't have been no accident,|not with her knowledge of boats.
{154868}{154915}[ Murmuring ]
{154918}{154990}You knew the former|Mrs. de Winter very well, I believe ?
{154988}{155072}- Oh, yes.|- Would you believe|her capable of suicide ?
{155072}{155148}<i>No, frankly I would not,</i>|<i>but you never can tell.</i>
{155148}{155215}You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.

{155455}{155492}<i>[ Pounds</i> G<i>avel ]</i>
{155498}{155572}I'm sorry to drag you back|for further questioning, Mr. de Winter.
{155570}{155652}You've heard the statement of Mr. Tabb.|I wonder if you can help us in any way.
{155652}{155720}- I'm afraid not.|- Can you think of any reason|why there should be holes...
{155720}{155785}in the planking of the late|Mrs. de Winter's boat ?
{155785}{155840}Well, of course I can't|think of any reason.
{155840}{155908}Has anyone ever discussed|these holes with you before ?
{155908}{156005}Well, since the boat has been|at the bottom of the ocean,|I scarcely think that likely.
{156002}{156088}Mr. de Winter, I want you to believe|we all feel very deeply for you,
{156088}{156148}but I don't conduct this|inquiry for my own amusement.
{156148}{156208}- That's rather obvious, isn't it ?|- I hope that it is.
{156208}{156298}<i>Since Mrs. de Winter went</i>|<i>sailing alone, are we to believe</i>|<i>she drove those holes herself?</i>
{156295}{156338}You may believe what you like.

{160082}{160148}Well, those holes in the planking,|for one thing.

{161605}{161662}Oh, I'm not going to bother you|with the contents now,

{161990}{162068}However, for the time being--
{162068}{162168}You know, Max, I'm getting awfully fed|up with my job as a motorcar salesman.
{162165}{162222}I don't know if you've ever|experienced the feeling...

{162340}{162420}You know what I mean.|You want to own the car yourself.
{162420}{162498}I've often wondered what it would be|like to retire to the country,

{164190}{164262}Oh, I know ColonelJulyan.|We're old friends, aren't we ?
{164262}{164355}Since you're old friends, I assume you|also know he's head of the police here.
{164358}{164438}I think he might be interested|to hear your proposition.|Go on, tell him all about it.
{164435}{164510}I merely said I hoped to give up|selling cars and retire.
{164512}{164562}Actually, he offered to withhold|a vital piece of evidence...
{164562}{164610}if I made it worth his while.
{164610}{164675}I only want to see justice done,|Colonel.
{164675}{164722}Now, that boatbuilder's evidence...
{164722}{164785}suggested certain theories|concerning Rebecca's death.
{164785}{164832}One of them, of course, is suicide.
{164832}{164948}I have a little note here which puts|that possibility quite out of court.

{165448}{165520}you'd go to all the trouble|of putting out to sea in a boat,
{165520}{165600}then take a hammer and chisel|and laboriously knock holes|through the bottom of it ?
{165598}{165658}Come, Colonel,|as an offiicer of the law,
{165658}{165738}don't you feel there are some|slight grounds for suspicion ?
{165738}{165792}- Of murder ?|- What else ?
{165792}{165875}You've known Max a long time, so|you know he's the old-fashioned type...

{166065}{166132}It can bring a lot of trouble|to a great many people,

{166215}{166288}I see. You're going to hold|de Winter's hand through all this...
{166288}{166382}just because he's the big noise|around here and he's actually|permitted you to dine with him.

{166825}{166898}But he was always hanging about.|He must have seen this whole thing.
{166895}{166965}It's ridiculous|even listening to all this.
{166965}{167030}Ah. You're like a little trades union,|all of you, aren't you ?

{168068}{168130}As you seem to have worked out|the whole thing so carefully,
{168132}{168188}perhaps you can provide us|also with a motive ?
{168188}{168248}I knew you were going|to bring that up, Colonel.
{168250}{168325}I've read enough detective stories to|know that there must always be a motive.
{168328}{168420}And if you'll all excuse me|for a moment, I'll supply that too.
{168418}{168500}I wish you would go home. You ought|not to be here through all this.
{168500}{168548}Please let me stay, Maxim.
{168548}{168598}<i>Surely, Colonel Julyan,you</i>'<i>re</i>|<i>not going to allow this fellow--</i>

{168718}{168772}I have no alternative|but to pursue his accusation.

{170180}{170230}No, no, I refuse to believe it.|I knew everything about her,
{170230}{170278}and I won't believe it.
{170280}{170352}There, you see ? It's impossible.|She knows that as well as I do.
{170350}{170422}Now, listen to me, Danny. We know that|Rebecca went to a doctor in London.
{170422}{170498}- Who was it ?|- I don't know.
{170498}{170548}Oh, I understand, Danny.
{170548}{170622}You think we're asking you|to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.
{170622}{170682}You're trying to defend her.|But that's what I'm doing.
{170685}{170752}I'm trying to clear her name|of the suspicion of suicide.
{170752}{170830}Mrs. Danvers,|it has been suggested...
{170828}{170892}Mrs. de Winter|was deliberately murdered.
{170892}{170948}There you have it|in a nutshell, Danny.
{170948}{171020}But there's one more thing you'll|want to know: the name of the murderer.
{171020}{171090}It's a lovely name that|rolls off the tongue so easily:
{171090}{171165}George Fortescue|Maximilian de Winter.
{171312}{171390}There was a doctor. Mrs. de Winter|sometimes went to him privately.
{171390}{171460}She used to go to him|even before she was married.
{171458}{171515}We don't want reminiscences, Danny.|What was his name ?
{171718}{171815}Dr. Baker, 1 65 Goldhawk Road,|Shepherd's Bush.
{171812}{171885}There you are, Colonel.|There's where you'll fiind your motive.
{171885}{171955}Go and question Dr. Baker.|He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him--
{171955}{172012}<i>to confiirm the fact that</i>|<i>she was going to have a child,</i>
{172012}{172072}<i>a sweet, curly-headed</i>|<i>little child.</i>
{172075}{172142}It isn't true. It isn't true.|She would have told me.
{172142}{172208}She told Max about it.|Maxim knew he wasn't the father.
{172208}{172292}So, like the gentleman of the old school|that he is, he killed her !
{172292}{172352}<i>[Julyan ] I</i>'<i>m afraid we shall have</i>|<i>to question this Dr. Baker.</i>
{172355}{172450}Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,|I think I'd like to go along too.
{172450}{172530}Yes, unfortunately, I suppose|you have the right to ask that.
{172528}{172610}I'll see the coroner|and have the inquest postponed|pending further evidence.
{172610}{172712}<i>I say, aren</i>'<i>t you rather afraid that the</i>|<i>prisoner, shall we say, might bolt ?</i>
{172710}{172788}You have my word for it|that he will not do that.
{172815}{172862}Toodle-oo, Max.|Come along, Danny.
{172865}{172960}Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend|their last moments together alone.
{173220}{173275}Are you sure you don't want me|to go with you, Maxim ?
{173275}{173325}No, darling.|It'll be very tiring for you.
{173330}{173422}I'll be back the very fiirst|thing in the morning, and|I won't even stop to sleep.
{173420}{173472}I'll be waiting for you.
{173605}{173668}- Ready, Maxim ?|- Yes.
{173668}{173738}You two go on ahead.|I'll follow with Favell.
{174062}{174172}Dr. Baker, you may have seen Mr. de|Winter's name in the papers recently.
{174172}{174265}Oh, yes, yes. In connection|with a body that was found in a boat.
{174265}{174338}My wife was reading all about it.|A very sad case.
{174335}{174395}- My condolences--|- Oh, this is going to take hours.|Let me--
{174395}{174465}Don't bother, Favell.|I think I can tell Dr. Baker.
{174465}{174522}We're trying to discover|certain facts...
{174522}{174605}concerning the late Mrs. de Winter's|activities on the day of her death,
{174605}{174690}October 1 2, last year,|and I want you to tell me, if you can,
{174690}{174770}if anyone of that name|paid you a visit on that date.
{174770}{174845}I'm awfully sorry.|I'm afraid I can't help you.
{174848}{174908}I should have remembered|the name de Winter.
{174908}{174970}I've never attended|a Mrs. de Winter in my life.
{174970}{175042}Well, how can you possibly tell|all your patients' names ?
{175040}{175122}I can look it up|in my engagement diary if you like.
{175122}{175198}<i>- Did you say the 1 2th of October?</i>|<i>- Yes.</i>
{175198}{175315}<i>Oh, here we are.</i>|<i>No, no de Winter.</i>
{175312}{175408}- Are you sure ?|- Well, here are all|the appointments for that day.
{175405}{175490}'' Ross, Campbell, Steadall,|Perrino, Danvers, Mathews--''
{175490}{175550}Danny ! What the devil !
{175550}{175635}Would you read that name again ?|Did you say Danvers ?
{175632}{175698}Yes, I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.
{175698}{175755}What did she look like ?|Can you remember ?
{175755}{175835}Yes, I remember her quite well.|She was a very beautiful woman--
{175835}{175908}tall, dark,|exquisitely dressed.
{175908}{175990}- Rebecca.|- The lady must|have used an assumed name.
{175988}{176130}Is that so ? This is a surprise.|I'd known her a long time.
{176128}{176165}What was the matter with her ?
{176168}{176218}My dear sir,|there are certain ethics.
{176218}{176312}Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker,|for Mrs. de Winter's suicide ?
{176312}{176385}For her murder, you mean. She was|going to have a kid, wasn't she ?
{176385}{176432}Come on, out with it !
{176432}{176508}Tell me what else a woman of her class|be doing in a dump like this ?
{176508}{176578}I take it the offiicial nature of this|visit makes it necessary for me to--
{176578}{176678}I assure you we'd not be troubling you|if it were not necessary.
{176678}{176740}You want to know|if I can suggest any motive...
{176738}{176802}as to why Mrs. de Winter|should have taken her life ?
{176802}{176880}Yes, I think I can.
{176920}{177012}The woman who called herself|Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill.
{177012}{177100}She was not|going to have a child ?
{177098}{177190}That was what she thought,|but my diagnosis was different.
{177190}{177318}I sent her to a well-known specialist|for an examination and X-rays,
{177315}{177412}and on this date she returned|to me for his report.
{177410}{177508}I remember her standing here|holding out her hand for the photograph.
{177508}{177560}''I want to know the truth,''|she said.
{177560}{177632}''I don't want soft words|and a bedside manner.
{177632}{177700}If I'm for it,|you can tell me right away.''
{177700}{177762}I knew she was not the type|to accept a lie.
{177762}{177832}She'd asked for the truth,|so I let her have it.
{177832}{177932}She thanked me and I never|saw her again, so I assumed that--
{177930}{178005}- What was wrong with her ?|- Cancer.
{178065}{178125}<i>Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.</i>
{178125}{178198}<i>An operation would have been</i>|<i>no earthly use at all.</i>
{178198}{178265}<i>In a short time,</i>|<i>she would have been under morphia.</i>
{178262}{178348}<i>There was nothing that could</i>|<i>be done for her, e</i>x<i>cept wait.</i>
{178350}{178442}<i>[ Ma</i>x<i>im ]</i>|<i>Did she say anything when you told her?</i>
{178440}{178522}<i>She smiled</i>|<i>in a queer sort of way.</i>
{178522}{178592}Your wife was a wonderful woman,|Mr. de Winter.
{178592}{178660}And, oh yes,|I remember she said something...
{178662}{178732}that struck me as being|very peculiar at the time.
{178732}{178795}When I told her|it was a matter of months,
{178795}{178868}she said,|''Oh, no, Doctor, not that long.''
{178938}{179015}You've been very kind.|You've told us all we wanted to know.
{179018}{179085}We shall probably need|an offiicial verifiication.
{179082}{179158}-Verifiication ?|<i>-Yes, to confiirm the verdict of suicide.</i>
{179158}{179230}<i>[ Dr. Baker ] I understand. Can I</i>|<i>offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?</i>
{179230}{179305}<i>[Julyan ] No, very kind.</i>|<i>I think we ought to be going.</i>
{179372}{179420}Thank heaven we know the truth.
{179420}{179468}Dreadful thing, dreadful.
{179468}{179535}Ayoung and lovely woman like her.|No wonder--
{179535}{179645}I never had the remotest idea.|Neither did Danny, I'm sure.
{179680}{179728}I wish I had a drink.
{179730}{179790}Will we be needed at the inquest|any further, ColonelJulyan ?
{179792}{179855}Oh, no. I can see to it that Maxim|is not troubled any further.
{179855}{179910}- Thank you, sir.|- Are you ready to start, Colonel ?
{179910}{179972}No, thank you.|I'm staying in town tonight.
{179972}{180068}And let me tell you, Favell,|blackmail is not much of a profession,
{180068}{180158}and we know how to deal with it|in our part of the world,|strange as it may seem to you.
{180155}{180215}I'm sure I don't know|what you're talking about.
{180218}{180290}But if you ever need a new car,|Colonel,just let me know.
{180290}{180362}It's impossible to thank you for your|kindness to us through all this.
{180362}{180428}- You know what I feel|without my saying anything.|- Not at all.
{180430}{180502}Better let your wife know.|She'll be getting worried.
{180500}{180572}Yes, I'll phone her at once, then|we'll get straight down to Manderley.
{180572}{180650}Good-bye, Crawley.|Maxim's got a great friend.
{180795}{180852}- Frank.|- Yes, Maxim ?
{180900}{180958}There's something you don't know.
{180960}{181022}Oh, no, there isn't.
{181222}{181278}I didn't kill her, Frank.
{181278}{181325}But I know now that when|she told me about the child,
{181325}{181380}she wanted me to kill her.
{181380}{181455}She lied on purpose.|She foresaw the whole thing.
{181458}{181525}That's why she stood there|laughing when she--
{181525}{181588}Don't think about it anymore.
{181638}{181688}Thank you, Frank.
{181730}{181818}Hello, Danny ?|I just wanted to tell you the news.
{181818}{181918}Rebecca held out on both of us.|She had cancer.
{181960}{182015}Yes, suicide.
{182015}{182088}And now Max and that|dear little bride of his...
{182088}{182180}will be able to stay on at Manderley|and live happily ever after.
{182212}{182260}Bye-bye, Danny.
{182330}{182410}- Is this your car, sir ?|- Yes.
{182410}{182482}Will you be going soon ?|This isn't a parking place, you know.
{182482}{182530}Oh, isn't it ?|People are entitled...
{182530}{182582}to leave their cars|outside if they want to.
{182582}{182668}It's a pity some of you fellows|haven't anything better to do.
{182745}{182818}When you phoned,|did she say she'd wait up ?
{182818}{182892}I asked her to go to bed,|but she wouldn't hear of it.
{182930}{183002}I wish I could get some|more speed out of this thing.
{183002}{183062}Is something worrying you, Maxim ?
{183062}{183135}I can't get over the feeling|something's wrong.
{184265}{184322}- Frank !|- What's the matter ? Why did we stop ?
{184325}{184372}What's the time ?
{184372}{184442}Oh, this clock's wrong.|It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why ?
{184442}{184498}<i>That can</i>'<i>t be the dawn</i>|<i>breaking over there.</i>
{184498}{184562}It's in the winter that|you see the Northern Lights, isn't it ?
{184608}{184685}That's not the Northern Lights.|That's Manderley !
{185235}{185310}Frith ! Frith !|Mrs. de Winter. Where is she ?
{185308}{185360}- I thought I saw her, sir.|- Where ?
{185532}{185568}Maxim.
{185610}{185670}Thank heaven|you've come back to me.
{185670}{185742}- Are you all right, darling ?|Are you all right ?|- Oh, yes, I'm all right.
{185742}{185810}Mrs. Danvers. She's gone mad.
{185810}{185885}She said she'd rather destroy Manderley|than see us happy here.
