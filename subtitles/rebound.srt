161
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:18,582
Besides, Coach Roy is never
hit appear

162
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,891
Okay, great, great,
so that is the criteria

163
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,420
He is never hit the kids, then he could
work in no one find it

164
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,064
Yeah, l know
but check it up

165
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,060
lf he step his line in anyway,
all we have to do is call the NCBA

166
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,372
And he is been out of here

167
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,205
So l think he is gonna be responsible

168
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,603
Okay, how you gonna to run the school
and monitor a mad man ?

You go all the games, anyway
you gonna be my eye and ear

172
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,994
Yeah, the minute you said he is
out of line

173
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:00,691
He is gone

174
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,663
Come on, coach

175
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,132

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,471
Too much press

180
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,170
What's that ?

181
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:49,372
Look, l don't care how many
times he wants

182
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,242
l don't care anything about that
under his reputation

183
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,410
Come on, give him a chance
-Of what ?

184
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,281
He got some problem

185
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,689
Oh, he didn't hit anybody
-Yeah

We hit him and
brought off of him
