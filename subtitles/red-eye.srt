Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,335
Let's go.

3
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,127
- Taylor. Bob and Marianne Taylor.
- Just bear with me one second.

4
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,728
- There are other hotels in Miami.
- I'm sorry.

5
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,708
What is the problem here? We made
these reservations over six months ago.

6
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,267
- I know, I'm just not seeing it.
- Where's Lisa?

7
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,871
- Lisa always takes care of us.
- She's out of town.

8
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:31,109
- Her grandmother passed away.
- Cynthia?

9
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,118
- Yes?
- Would you get in more trouble

10
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,713
if you bothered her
or if I called corporate?

11
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:38,848
OK.

12
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,162
Damn! Dallas drivers!

13
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,823
Who taught you how to drive?
Stevie Wonder?

14
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,834
- You'll catch your plane. You got...
- Ten minutes.

15
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,494
- Lisa Reisert.
- Lisa? Hi.

16
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:56,030
I'm so sorry to call, but I didn't
know what to do. I have a situation.

17
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,306
- Slow down. What's the problem?
- Bob and Marianne Taylor.

18
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,903
Yep. They're regulars.

19
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,949
Yeah, well, I think I sort of
erased their reservation.

20
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,985
I was never checked out
on this system.

21
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,818
Did I mention I had a confirmed
reservation? This is my receipt.

22
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,323
I downloaded it off the Internet myself.

23
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,225
- I know, Mrs. Taylor, calm down.
- Don't say that. No...

24
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,160
- Calm down?
- She told me to calm down.

25
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,530
Don't tell us to calm down.
We've been very calm right up until now.

26
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,536
- I'm so sorry. Lisa?
- Cynthia, tell them one more minute,

27
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,040
- they'll be happy, you promise.
- One more minute. You'll be happy.

28
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,631
- I promise.
- We better be.

29
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,803
Now, enter my PIN.
It's 7-8-8... Hang on.

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,942
- Dad? Hold on.
- Lisa?

31
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,141
- Can you hold on?
- Sure.

32
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,550
OK, it's 7-8-8-4-underscore-L-Reisert.

33
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,181
- Lisa, I'm so sorry for calling.
- No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.

34
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,157
- Are you logged in yet?
- What do I do?

35
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,457
Click on the Crisis folder,
you'll see a list of empty rooms,

36
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,498
give 'em fourth-floor,
comp 'em for tonight and tomorrow.

37
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:57,059
OK, just a sec. OK, you are all set.

38
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,400
The first two nights
are gonna be on us.

39
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,168
And if you need anything else,
just let me know.

40
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,937
We won't.

41
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,739
This is not my fault.

42
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,114
God, they totally threw me.
They were such assholes.

43
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,310
There are no assholes.
Only guests with special needs.

44
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,718
- Here we are.
- Keep it. Anything else?

45
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:19,053
The Simpsons didn't get
the California King they requested.

46
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,114
What else?

47
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,520
- Oh, my God.
- Tell me.

48
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,394
Security left a message
saying the Charles Keefe party

49
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,798
will be arriving
at 5:30am instead of pm.

50
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,462
That's not that unusual.
It's a security thing.

51
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,371
Make sure our guys have the entrance
set, his security takes it from there.

52
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,875
Is Mr. Keefe Platinum Club
or something or?

53
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,605
Political. Homeland Security.

54
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,773
Make sure there's a box
of Montecristo Cubans in the room

55
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,647
and a bottle of Cristal on ice.
It's 3825.

56
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,278
- OK. Got it covered. Safe flight.
- Thanks.

57
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,190
Attention passengers
leaving on flight 1387.

58
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,591
- Lisa Reisert.
- I'm still here.

59
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,220
Dad, I'm so sorry.

60
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,465
- It's fine, sweetie.
- What's up?

61
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,764
Gearin' up for another sleepless night
with a comedy marathon.

62
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,566
Before I forget,

63
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,903
that book I gave you,
you finish it yet?

64
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,533
Almost.

65
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,504
You know, he's from Texas.
I didn't think shrinks came from there.

66
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,277
Yeah, they do. They just move
to California and start TV shows.

67
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,251
- How's the remodeling?
- Good. Good.

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,185
They made headway
in the last few days.

69
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,691
I lost my wallet, but that's par
for the course. It's lookin' good.

70
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,589
That's good.
I can't wait to see it.

71
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,461
You should. The upstairs hallway
is totally unrecognizable.

72
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,092
- Your room hasn't been touched.
- No, Dad.

73
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,262
Please, go nuts, make it
into a gym or a putting green.

74
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,329
You know I can't do that.

75
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:44,069
You never know when you might just
wanna spend a few nights back here.

76
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:48,204
You know? Make an escape
from the day-to-day.

77
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,681
Day-to-day, it's where I thrive.
You know that.

78
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,182
Right.

79
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,179
So,

80
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:01,192
- how's your mom holdin' up?
- As good as can be expected.

81
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,862
You? What about you?
You all right?

82
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,160
- Yep, I'm fine.
- You sure?

83
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,634
Everything's fine, Dad. You're gonna
have to start takin' my word for it.

84
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,569
Look, I gotta go. I gotta check in.

85
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,073
You sure you don't need a pickup?

86
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,873
- I thought you lost your wallet.
- Leese, it's just five minutes.

87
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,380
I'm taking the red-eye.
It's the last flight.

88
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,882
It's gonna be late.
I love you. I'll call you.

89
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,114
- I love you too, sweetie.
- OK, bye.

90
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:36,218
Attention. We have a cancellation
update. Flight 1192 has been canceled.

91
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,330
Anybody who was on the flight
to Atlanta that was canceled,

92
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,201
come to the front of the line
so we can reroute you.

93
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,035
Flight 1019 to Miami...

94
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,774
- I'm sorry.
- Don't sweat it.

95
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,573
I'm wearing my combat boots.

96
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,549
- Excuse me?
- Travel is war these days.

97
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,050
Yeah.

98
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,348
I just love him.

99
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,118
How is that? Are you learning a lot?

100
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,783
I'm not really sure.

101
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,085
He's so handsome.

102
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,222
I work during the day
so I always miss his shows.

103
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,823
Flight 247 to Cleveland
has been delayed.

104
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,234
- Here. That'll catch you up.
- Oh, no. No, no, I... I couldn't.

105
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,967
I'm finished. My Dad's given me so
many, I could start a library. Please.

106
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,533
- That's very nice of you.
- Once again anyone who is scheduled

107
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,012
on the flight to Atlanta, if you
wanna get out of Dallas tonight,

108
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,549
come to the front
of the line at this time.

109
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,847
Excuse me.
You're letting them go,

110
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,980
but we've been standing
for an hour? How does that happen?

111
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,217
If we don't re-book,
they miss their flight.

112
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,728
It doesn't matter that you
canceled my flight then rerouted?

113
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,764
- I understand.
- Get your boss. This is ridiculous!

114
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,596
Don't make her do that.
She's doing the best she can.

115
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,431
I don't think I was talking to you

116
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,232
- I realize that...
- I'm trying...

117
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,273
Please, sir.

118
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,571
She is the one standing
between us getting out and anarchy.

119
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,204
- Yeah, but she's not the one in...
- She's exhausted, worked 18 hours,

120
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,976
and she suspects we all hate her
just as much as you do.

121
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,951
What do you say we give her a break?
Let her get back to a job

122
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,955
I'm guessing is a lot
more thankless than yours.

123
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,160
This airline sucks.

124
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,033
Next in line, please.

125
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,796
That's me.

126
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,496
Here.

127
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,170
Thank you very much.
And thank you.

128
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,540
You're welcome.

129
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,273
Yeah. Thank you.

130
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,315
Not at all.
That was just backup.

131
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,044
- You got the ball rolling.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,348
- Reflex, I guess.
- Why is that?

133
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,981
I work in a hotel. I deal
with people like that all the time.

134
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,324
The Marriott? The Hilton?

135
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,726
- The Lux Atlantic It's in...
- Miami.

136
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,821
- Right. I know it well.
- Yeah.

137
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,562
- So you're on this...
- Very delayed flight to Miami. Yeah.

138
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,196
- You?
- Yeah. Sadly, yeah.

139
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,673
But you know what? That's
why God created the Tex-Mex.

140
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,940
The best nachos in the airport
and right across from our gate.

141
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,379
Good tip. Thanks.

142
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,348
Save you a seat.

143
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,148
Yeah, that was... I thought
since we're on the same flight...

144
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,956
I didn't mean to invade
your personal space or...

145
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,395
- No.
- I can take you over here.

146
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:29,628
- I just... I have a few calls to make.
- Sure. I understand. You go ahead.

147
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,728
- Have a good flight.
- OK. You too.

148
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,365
We will be updating you
with the departure time

149
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,103
of flight 1019
with service to Miami...

150
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,543
- Hi.
- Hi. You must be Rebecca.

151
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,205
- Yes.
- Well, my name's Mary,

152
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,341
and I hear this is the first time
you're flying by yourself.

153
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,012
Well, you must be very brave.

154
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,782
- Are you gonna be OK?
- Yes, Mom.

155
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,255
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

156
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,419
- I'm just asking.
- I'm 11, not nine.

157
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,655
Come with me, you two.

158
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,525
There you go, sir.
Your nachos. Careful, hot plate.

159
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,159
Thank you, sir.

160
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,931
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

161
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,531
- It's iced. Don't worry.
- OK.

162
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,203
- Let me find you napkins.
- No, no, no. It's fine.

163
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,745
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

164
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,713
OK. Larry,

165
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,716
could you run back to Starbucks?
I need another mocha.

166
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,378
- Finish that one already?
- Someone's wearin' it.

167
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,649
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention.

168
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,853
Flight number 17 leaving Dallas
National Airport from gate two

169
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,418
will be delayed for 20 minutes.

170
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,247
Paging a skycap with
electric cart to gate four.

171
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,780
Paging a skycap with
electric cart to gate four.

172
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,421
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,696
- Is this taken?
- No, it's all yours.

174
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,256
Thanks.

175
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,098
So did you get your calls made?

176
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,966
Yep. No more calls.

177
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,167
Good. What will you have?

178
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,074
- No, it's... I'm OK.
- If I can guess...

179
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,540
OK.

180
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,818
I'm feeling vodka.

181
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,280
Definitely sweetened.

182
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,259
Cosmo. Way too common.

183
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,686
Screwdriver.

184
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,857
No. No. No. Way too boring.

185
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,959
So that leaves me with the
simplicity of the grapefruit

186
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,369
or the complexity of the pineapple.

187
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,206
Grapefruit sea breeze.

188
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,681
- Could I have a bay breeze?
- You got it.

189
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,011
Thanks.

190
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,746
It's an impressive talent, though.
Very close.

191
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,687
- You know, breaks the ice.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,486
- So are you headed home?
- Yeah. Trying.

193
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,527
Yeah. Flying's so
much fun these days.

194
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,155
Fun for me is just getting off
that plane in one piece.

195
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,758
- Fear of flying?
- Yeah. Just a little.

196
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,826
Were you in Texas
on hotel business?

197
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,394
No. My grandmother died.

198
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,408
It's OK. She was 91.

199
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,945
- Ninety-one.
- Yeah.

200
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,446
That's respectable.
What was her secret?

201
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,416
Grape-Nuts. And a guy named Duke.

202
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,510
Excuse me?

203
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:39,251
Yeah, she said the Grape-Nuts
kept her arteries clean

204
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,817
and Duke helped with the rest.

205
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,196
Wow. A dynamic woman.

206
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,202
Nothing fazed her, you know?
She was so optimistic.

207
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,005
"Always look forward."

208
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,540
That's what she'd say

209
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,338
- There ya go.
- Thanks.

210
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,474
...heightened security
measures are now in place.

211
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,916
- That taste OK?
- It's fine.

212
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,885
You sure? 'Cause we can
always get you that sea breeze.

213
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,421
You sound like my dad.
I say I'm fine,

214
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,458
he says, "Are you sure?" I'm sure.

215
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,461
- OK, I believe you.
- Good.

216
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,089
- The name's Jackson, by the way.
- Lisa.

217
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,395
- Pleased to meet you.
- Is it Jack for short?

218
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,096
No, I haven't gone by Jack
since I was ten years old.

219
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,936
Last name's Rippner.

220
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,831
Jack Rippner.

221
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,106
Jack... the...

222
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,771
- There you go.
- OK.

223
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,247
- That wasn't very nice of your parents.
- No.

224
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,285
That's what I told 'em
before I killed 'em.

225
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,341
What?

226
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,658
Well, if it's any comfort,
my middle name's Henrietta.

227
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,953
Henrietta.

228
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,019
But that's my
grandma's name, though.

229
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,061
Was.

230
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,725
Well, here's to Henrietta,
whose spirit is very much alive.

231
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,707
What?

232
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,455
I'm tellin' you, man,
she was tasty.

233
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,389
And now let's go
to Washington for an update.

234
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,227
As the war on terrorism escalates,
Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security

235
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,790
Charles Keefe embarks on a seven-day
tour of Southern port cities,

236
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,929
starting tomorrow. You may
recall that four months ago,

237
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,463
Keefe sent shockwaves through
the department after he made remarks

238
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,533
during his first press conference.

239
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,707
I don't discriminate, I communicate.
Just not always with a kind word.

240
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,080
Now, don't get me wrong,
I believe in diplomacy.

241
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:50,679
It can work. But first
you have to have their attention.

242
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:56,585
Do I have your attention?
Thank you. Thank you very much.

243
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:01,292
We're cleared for the boarding of
flight 1019, service to Miami, Florida.

244
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,169
- I guess that's us.
- Wonders never cease.

245
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,473
Yeah.

246
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,879
- Let me get this.
- Oh, no. No. Please.

247
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,542
I got it. I got it.

248
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,449
- Yeah. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

249
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,885
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

250
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,614
Well...

251
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,385
Report unattended baggage

252
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,554
- to airport security. Thank you.
- Can you hang on? I'm sorry.

253
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,224
Hello? Yeah.

254
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,326
Can you just hold on?

255
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,863
I gotta take this.

256
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,167
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

257
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,003
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

258
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,202
- Have a good flight. Bye-bye.
- You too.

259
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,608
Bye.

260
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,375
Hey. Yeah, looks like
we're gettin' outta here.

261
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,611
The storm's moved on.
No, there's time.

262
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,118
- Thank you for your patience, sir.
- Yeah, right.

263
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,857
Come on, we gotta move it, bro.
Come on.

264
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,722
- You made it, boys.
- Yeah. Just barely.

265
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,527
Thank you. Bye-bye.

266
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,089
Here we go.

267
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,567
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thanks.

268
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,665
There you go.
Thanks for your patience.

269
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,302
5-A is to your right.
Enjoy your flight. Hello.

270
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,972
- Hi.
- 18-G. Down the aisle to your left.

271
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,072
- Thank you.
- Thanks for your patience.

272
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,582
- How are you?
- Better now.

273
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,141
- Sorry for the delay.
- 21-F.

274
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,449
- 21-F is right down...
- Yeah. Thank you.

275
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,489
Hi, how are you?

276
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,292
We're going to dim the lighting

277
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:40,321
for tonight's flight. Lights can be
activated by the button on your armrest.

278
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,493
Once we've reached cruising altitude
and the captain turns off

279
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,936
the fasten seat belt sign,
we will be offering our beverage service

280
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,497
with complimentary soft drinks,
juice and coffee.

281
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,941
- I'll help.
- Cocktails available for a charge.

282
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,603
Thank you

283
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,877
Hi.

284
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,849
Again.

285
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,446
- I figured you'd be in first class.
- No, not me.

286
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,786
- I'm all coach, all the time.
- Me too.

287
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:10,522
Yeah. I think that's my seat.

288
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,497
- What, you're not sitting here.
- Well, I don't know.

289
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,863
- That says 18-G?
- You're kidding.

290
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,165
You're not kidding.
You need a bellhop?

291
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,503
- No, no, no. That's OK.
- Let me help. I insist.

292
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,907
- You OK?
- Yeah.

293
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,536
- You sure? OK.
- Yeah.

294
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,047
I'm not normally such a lightweight.

295
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,547
Those were strong bay breezes.

296
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,452
Well, I'm cutting you off anyways,
all right?

297
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,518
So... What are the odds?

298
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,189
Yeah, I know.

299
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,533
Wait a minute.

300
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,694
You're not stalking me, are you?

301
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,261
No.

302
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,939
- You got me.
- I'm sorry.

303
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,450
- Oh, jeez.
- You all right?

304
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,681
If I say yes,
are you gonna ask me if I'm sure?

305
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,656
No. No. That's your dad's department.

306
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,149
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

307
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,526
Earlier today I had
some cheap wine at the funeral,

308
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,122
and combined with the cheap vodka...

309
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,328
- I see.
- I blame you for that part.

310
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,201
- Well, I feel terrible now.
- You should.

311
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,671
Oh, I do.

312
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,699
We know it's been a long night, so stow
your belongings and take your seats

313
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,508
as quickly as possible,
we'll be under way. Thank you.

314
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,573
- I think somebody needs a bellhop.
- Excuse me.

315
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,845
OK.

316
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,513
Let me.

317
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,816
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

318
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,625
Just when I thought there
weren't any gentlemen left.

319
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,489
You have a pleasant flight.

320
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,796
Oh, my.

321
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,065
I'm already in chapter two.

322
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,334
Great.

323
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,970
I gave her this book earlier.

324
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,741
She's a huge Dr. Phil fan.

325
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,181
I saw that. Very nice of you.

326
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,946
Well, that's me.

327
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,714
People-pleaser, 24-7.

328
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,453
- Well, you are popular.
- I'm sorry.

329
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,926
- No, it's OK. No.
- It isn't usually like this.

330
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,326
Go ahead.

331
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,795
Hey. What's up?

332
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,329
Yeah. No, it's OK.

333
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,029
So it's definitely happening?

334
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,402
5:30. OK, done deal.

335
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,401
Work. For the last time.

336
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,480
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Good flight.

337
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,217
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

338
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,255
At this time we'd like
to ask that you discontinue

339
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,767
the use of any electronic devices,
pagers, cell phones, laptops,

340
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,826
anything with a switch
should now be in the off position.

341
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,702
The use of cell phones is not
allowed during the flight.

342
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,868
A list of devices suitable for use
can be found on the cover

343
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,675
- of your Fresh Air magazine.
- Flight attendants, please be seated.

344
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,560
From the deck, looks
like we're the red-eye to Miami.

345
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,098
Welcome.
The weather conditions may cause

346
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,397
a bumpy takeoff, but don't worry,
we'll soon climb above it.

347
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,528
We'll see if we can't
make up lost time.

348
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,472
We're number one for departure.
Flight attendants, secure the cabin.

349
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:49,346
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been cleared
for takeoff. Please enjoy your flight.

350
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,633
- We're not gonna make it.
- Shut up.

351
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,032
We're not gonna make it.

352
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,469
Shut up. I will punch
you in your face. Shut up.

353
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,870
Just kidding. Come on.

354
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,323
Are we there yet?

355
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:45,029
So was Henrietta your
mom's mom or your dad's mom?

356
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,499
My mom's. My dad's...

357
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,675
My dad's died a long time ago.

358
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,579
Are your folks still together?

359
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,318
They divorced three years ago,
married for 32.

360
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,954
That's a shame.

361
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,450
So your mom...

362
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,259
Mom moved back to Texas
and Dad stayed in Miami.

363
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,527
I see. And does Dad still work?

364
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,467
Yeah. No! He's recently retired.

365
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,631
He's got a lot of time on his hands
so he makes phone calls.

366
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,834
OK. He's filling
all his work time with...

367
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,638
Worry time.

368
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,407
Does he have reason
to worry about you?

369
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,749
Well, even if he does, I mean,

370
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,946
he's just gotta get used
to the fact that life changes

371
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,854
and sometimes things happen.

372
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,255
I know what you mean.

373
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,556
Usually when things are going perfectly,
you're back on track,

374
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:48,065
everything's going to plan,
and then one day, outta nowhere,

375
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,693
somebody forgets to bolt
the engine to the wing.

376
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,600
Yeah.

377
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,539
This is your captain. We're through
the worst of it, so you can relax.

378
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,872
Keep your seat belt
fastened while seated,

379
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,810
as we may hit more turbulence.
Thank you.

380
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,806
- Thanks for distracting me.
- Well, it's not really what I'm doing.

381
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,681
What are you doing?

382
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,313
Just keeping the focus
on you and your father.

383
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,716
Why?

384
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,281
Part of my job.

385
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,024
Are you a shrink?

386
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,298
No. Manager.

387
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,031
- Better not say of a hotel.
- No.

388
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,071
- That would...
- Cause you to buy a self-help book.

389
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,171
So, what do you do?

390
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:36,510
Government overthrows, flashy
high-profile assassinations. The usual.

391
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:43,010
- You're a spy. I should've known.
- No, I'm not a spy.

392
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,617
- A hit man.
- I'm a lousy shot.

393
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,886
Right. You work for the CIA.

394
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,190
Well, if I did,
I couldn't say, could I?

395
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,390
- But, no.
- The Mafia?

396
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,126
The money's shit.

397
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,268
OK, well, that's kinda weird.

398
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,772
- Why don't you tell me what you do?
- I did.

399
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,177
OK. OK, I'm sorry, I...

400
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,614
It's... Whatever you do,
that's your own business.

401
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,811
Just as long as you're not...

402
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,945
What?

403
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,422
Hijacking the plane.

404
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,755
No. No, I'm not suicidal.

405
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,387
That's good.

406
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,228
You're right.
Most days it is my own business.

407
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,633
But right now, as fate would have it,
my business is all about you.

408
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,001
- I'm sorry, about me?
- That's right.

409
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,704
OK, I'm not sure
where you're going with this.

410
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,305
Charles Keefe. One of your
regular VIPs. Ring a bell?

411
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,108
- No, should it?
- Yes, it should.

412
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,349
He's on his way to your hotel
and that's why you need to listen.

413
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,118
No. No, I don't think...

414
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,182
- I don't have to do that.
- Yes, you do,

415
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,921
if you want your dad to live.

416
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,231
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

417
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,903
Yeah.

418
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,471
Suit yourself. You might
wanna take a look at this.

419
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,844
JR. Joe Reisert.
Your father? Yes?

420
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,811
- Where did you get that?
- I didn't get it.

421
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,445
My associate grabbed it
off your dad's desk.

422
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,422
Apparently next to
your graduation picture.

423
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,217
JR. Definitely Dad's wallet.

424
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,954
His initials. But gee, mine too.

425
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,895
Jack Rippner. Credit card, license.

426
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:36,024
"For some reason,
Miss Stewardess, this unstable,

427
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,729
inebriated girl,
whom I've never met before tonight,

428
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,330
suddenly went crazy
when I took it out of my pocket."

429
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,372
You tell the flight attendant
and your dad dies.

430
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,711
Sit down.

431
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,386
You might wanna buckle up.

432
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,905
- Any luck?
- Our pensions go, then our coffeepots.

433
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,910
18-G's flashing.
Do you want me to?

434
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:23,175
I'll take care of it. She
probably just wants another drink.

435
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,307
Maybe I'll join her.

436
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,850
- Hi.
- Hi.

437
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,087
- What can I do for ya?
- Leese,

438
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,790
did you need another
pillow or anything?

439
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,225
No, I don't need anything.

440
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,960
She's just had a really rough day.

441
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,368
A death in the family.

442
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:51,136
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

443
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,973
- I'll get you water and some tissues.
- Thanks.

444
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,036
- Be right back.
- Thank you.

445
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,083
That was great, Leese.
Keep doing the right thing.

446
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,451
Just bottle the emotions
a little more, OK?

447
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,391
Have you done something to my father?

448
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,590
No. And it'll stay that way
as long as you keep playing along.

449
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,434
What do you want from me?

450
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,936
Now, I wanna wait
for your Kleenex and water.

451
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,338
And once we have our privacy,
we can get back to business.

452
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,433
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

453
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,479
- Sure. Feel better, hon.
- Thank you.

454
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,694
I need you to call your hotel.

455
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,629
It's very simple.
Just use your managerial pull

456
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:50,964
to move Keefe
from 3825 to suite 4080.

457
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,903
I'll leave the details to you.
You just sell it.

458
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,772
You've got the wrong person.
I don't have the authority to do that.

459
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,538
Well, I happen to know that you do.

460
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,842
You're the only voice
that can get this done

461
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,007
by the time I need it done.

462
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,444
- You need me to write it down?
- No.

463
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,915
Well, then what's the delay?

464
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,357
So by changing Keefe's room,
does that make it easier?

465
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,567
Lisa, whatever female-driven,
emotion-based dilemma

466
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,235
you're dealing with right now,
you have my sympathy.

467
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,642
But for the sake
of time and sanity,

468
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,410
let's break this down into a little
male-driven, fact-based logic.

469
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:42,180
One simple phone call
saves your dad's life.

470
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,221
And it has to be made soon.

471
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,717
You're gonna kill Keefe,
aren't you?

472
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,252
You really need to start worrying
more about your dad, Leese.

473
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:56,823
How am I supposed to know if he's OK?
How do I know you haven't hurt him?

474
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,028
- He's fine.
- Why am I supposed to believe?

475
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,971
The last call I got said he was sitting
in the TV room eating leftover lasagna

476
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,168
and watching the comedy marathon.

477
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,839
Relax, Leese. By now my guy is
probably back in his silver Beemer,

478
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,714
parked outside
9321 Blossom Palms Lane.

479
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,879
He's sitting in the dark,
listening to a little smooth jazz,

480
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,220
while he sharpens
his 12-inch KA-BAR.

481
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,252
That's a knife, Leese.

482
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,097
- I wanna talk to my dad.
- Sure. After you make the call.

483
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:36,834
No. I wanna know he's OK right now
or I don't call anybody.

484
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,270
Your dime.

485
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,980
Credit card?

486
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,820
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has
turned off the fasten seat belt sign.

487
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,792
You're free to move about the cabin.

488
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:28,457
Stay tuned for more of the comedy
marathon following these messages.

489
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,732
I'm comin', I'm comin'!

490
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,601
God.

491
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,902
- Hello?
- Dad?

492
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,042
Leese? Are you already home?

493
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,575
No, I'm on the air phone on the plane.

494
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,341
We were late taking off and...

495
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:54,317
Honey, I know you don't like it
when I ask, but are you all right?

496
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,216
You sound upset.

497
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,948
Leese?

498
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,789
Leese? Are you still there?

499
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,430
Did he sound healthy to you?

500
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,401
I hope that's a yes,
because that's the best I can do.

501
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,165
Now let's get this over with.

502
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:19,300
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Can you help me again?

503
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,141
Last time, I promise.

504
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,646
Sure.

505
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,587
Don't get cute.

506
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,099
- You're so sweet.
- Hello, again.

507
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,368
You know, I didn't think that
this book would be so much work.

508
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:54,605
There's all these surveys about yourself
before you can go on to the rest...

509
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,772
Could you wait one second?

510
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,443
- Sure.
- My nails.

511
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,280
Know what? Don't worry
about the surveys. I'll just...

512
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,687
- I'll just highlight my favorite part.
- Wonderful.

513
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,352
- Got it.
- Great.

514
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,416
- You are a lifesaver.
- Yep.

515
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,952
Would you gimme your address too?
I wanna return the favor.

516
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,465
I'm always breaking
my nails on these things.

517
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,229
I'm gonna need you
to help me put it back up.

518
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:22,103
- Clear the aisle.
- We're on a collision course.

519
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,466
- I'll come back for that later.
- No. Here you go.

520
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,102
- Last time?
- Thank you.

521
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,476
OK.

522
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,949
- Sorry I'm... I'm blocking your seat.
- Not at all.

523
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,883
- Excuse us, ma'am.
- I'm going.

524
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,478
Thank you.

525
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,924
They're much pushier these days.

526
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,798
I didn't want this
to get complicated.

527
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,797
I have to assume
she's gonna read that.

528
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,101
Read what?

529
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,023
- How's she doin'?
- Much better. Thank you.

530
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,034
- Good.
- Thanks.

531
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:49,884
Pillow?

532
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,192
Would you like a blanket?

533
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:57,998
Pillow? Pillow?

534
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,436
Would you like a blanket?
Would you like a blanket?

535
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,591
Please return to your seats. Thank you.

536
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,270
"I want you to get
excited about your life.

537
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,363
But you gotta get real.

538
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,432
I'm challenging you, starting now,

539
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,706
to stop dealing
in opinions and assumptions

540
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,610
and start dealing in facts.

541
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:47,173
Fact: Fearing to act is human.

542
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,811
Failing to act
is just plain dumb.

543
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:53,015
Fact: Thinking when
you should be acting

544
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,286
will only make your head hurt."

545
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,294
I'm not makin' this up, Leese.
It's right here.

546
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,988
Fact:

547
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,931
You've been out
for a half an hour

548
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,593
and Keefe's room still
hasn't been changed.

549
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,137
So I got you some aspirin.

550
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,569
I need you coherent, Leese.

551
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,410
Well, we were hoping
things would calm down,

552
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,473
but that's not happening. So control's
just cleared us up to 35,000 feet.

553
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,815
Let's see if we can't get above
this weather, smooth things out.

554
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,016
Now, let's do this.

555
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,926
If I do it, if I make that call,

556
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,399
do you promise you'll tell who's
outside my dad's house to go away?

557
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,369
You call, I call,
Dad wakes up, puts on coffee,

558
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,874
never suspects a thing,
you go back to work, life goes on.

559
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:51,340
I am now calling your hotel.

560
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,281
I don't have to tell you
to sound convincing.

561
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,321
- You've said enough.
- Good.

562
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:04,551
Good morning,
Lux Atlantic Resort, this is Cynthia.

563
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,359
Hello? Hello?

564
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,160
Cynthia, it's Lisa.

565
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,997
Lisa? You sound terrible.
Are you OK?

566
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,835
There's just... There's
a lot of turbulence on the plane.

567
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,807
- You're still on the plane?
- Yeah.

568
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,809
I heard flights are delayed.

569
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,437
You'd be so proud of me.
We're all set for Keefe.

570
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,676
Cristal on ice, the cigars,
not easy to find this time of night.

571
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,083
You know, about that. I'm gonna
need you to do me a favor, OK?

572
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,677
You sure you're OK?

573
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,189
Please do not
ask me again if I'm OK.

574
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,451
I hope you're...

575
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,063
Look, something's come up.

576
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,569
We gotta change Keefe's room.

577
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,502
Can you pull up the file?

578
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,537
We're gonna move him
to room 4080. Right.

579
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,580
The PIN is 4882.

580
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,646
- I'm gonna need you to take...
- Gimme that.

581
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,877
Hello? Cynthia?

582
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,251
Pretty clear thinking,
given the circumstances.

583
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,852
Let me guess,
stress management courses?

584
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,592
They're really paying off. We get
outta this, I may have to steal you.

585
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,764
- Excuse me, miss.
- Yes?

586
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:21,100
- Are the phones not working?
- They cut out during storms.

587
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,265
They'll come back
when we find clear air.

588
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,469
- Great. Thank you.
- You don't have a backup plan?

589
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,607
- Why are you doing this here?
- Blame your grandmother.

590
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,014
She keeled over,
you hopped on the next flight,

591
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,680
- Keefe changed plans, here we are.
- Excuse me. Peanuts or pretzels?

592
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,382
- Peanuts, thank you.
- Ma'am?

593
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,118
No.

594
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,158
So, what happens
if they don't start working?

595
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:48,225
You bury your dad
in a closed casket.

596
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:07,048
Well, gang, brace yourselves,
'cause I have news. I'm engaged!

597
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:05,872
I know him.

598
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,878
- Know who?
- Keefe.

599
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,506
He's a really decent man.

600
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,574
Well, sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

601
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,417
Like you.

602
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,955
You know, I've known you
for a while now, Lisa.

603
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,686
Before tonight, I mean.

604
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,661
And far as I can tell,
your life revolves around your job.

605
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,131
The occasional cocktail
at the corner cafe,

606
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,569
the classic late-night movies.
And scrambled eggs at 3am.

607
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,571
What turned you into such a loner?

608
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,834
Was it your parents' divorce?

609
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,204
Wait, did someone break your heart?

610
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,284
The captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

611
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,688
- I have to go to the restroom.
- You're free to move about the cabin.

612
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,523
Best I can do.

613
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,588
OK, you know what? You got me.

614
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:05,157
I'm gonna make that call
when I can make the call.

615
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,534
But right now you gotta let me go.

616
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,041
I need to go.

617
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,305
OK. I trust you.

618
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,645
And I need my purse.

619
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,706
But not that much.

620
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,558
I was really nervous
there for a minute.

621
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,424
We just kept goin' in and out.

622
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,947
Excuse me.

623
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,482
You in line?

624
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,756
Yeah. Do you wanna?

625
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,126
You were here first.

626
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,425
Excuse me.

627
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,764
Oh, God.

628
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,442
OK. Get up.

629
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,513
I was wondering...

630
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,256
Don't fight me.

631
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,560
You're all worked up
from being so creative. Breathe.

632
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:53,625
Hey, Rebecca.

633
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,133
You can’t just run off like that.

634
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,834
A man went in there.

635
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,174
Everyone shares. I'll take you
to the one close to your seat.

636
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:05,113
But a lady's in there too.

637
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,083
OK, one of those flights.
Here, come on.

638
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,919
Please, just stop whoever's
at my dad's house.

639
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:16,551
I already have, by twice
intercepting these little communiqués.

640
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,562
If they'd have fallen into
the hands of a stewardess,

641
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,861
she'd have gone to the cockpit
and we'd land somewhere else.

642
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,458
If that happens, Leese,
our guy in the BMW's

643
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,734
gonna know about it.
So do Dad a favor

644
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:33,038
and stop gambling with his life.

645
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:43,685
You don't have to do this.
Any of this.

646
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,627
Someone do that to you?

647
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:58,458
No.

648
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,737
Is that what it is?

649
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,398
No.

650
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,538
You know what I think?

651
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,406
You know what I think?

652
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,678
I think you're not
such an honest person.

653
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,117
Because I've followed you
for eight weeks now

654
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,814
and I never once
saw you order anything

655
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,153
but a fucking sea breeze.

656
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:24,023
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

657
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,360
I never lied to you, Leese.

658
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,495
Know why?
'Cause it doesn't serve me.

659
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,369
We're both professional.
We have the will and the means

660
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,636
to follow through.
'Cause when we don't,

661
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,270
our customers aren't happy.
And when they're not,

662
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,814
we suffer and our lives go to shit.

663
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,644
And that's not going to happen.

664
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,311
Is it?

665
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:55,183
- No.
- Good.

666
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:58,558
Because I'm gonna tell you
the phones are working again.

667
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:01,358
Are you sure we
got a deal this time?

668
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,097
Yes.

669
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,960
Peachy.

670
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,209
Well, thanks for the quickie.

671
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,035
Good.

672
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,348
Come on.

673
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,783
Excuse me.

674
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,449
This isn't a motel.

675
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,517
Sure.

676
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,996
- Lose something?
- Yes, my book.

677
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:44,782
