<i>Sonja.</i>

5
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:28,054
<i>You are suffering, Sonja...</i>

6
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:32,734
<i>but vengeance shall be yours.</i>

7
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:35,414
<i>Vengeance on Queen Gedren...</i>

8
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,534
<i>who wanted you for herself.</i>

9
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:42,973
<i>Your disgust was clear.</i>

10
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:51,413
<i>And so it was that Gedren</i>
<i>ordered your family murdered...</i>

11
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:57,053
<i>your body violated by her soldiers.</i>

12
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,973
<i>But in your quest</i>
<i>for justice and vengeance...</i>

13
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:06,412
<i>you will need great strength...</i>

14
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:11,532
<i>for your sword arm must have no equal.</i>

15
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:15,972
<i>I give you that strength.</i>

16
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:04,284
Varna, where is the Lord of Hyrkania?

17
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,724
He has not come, Highness.

18
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:09,964
He should be here
for the destruction of the talisman.

19
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:14,923
But we cannot delay.
We will proceed without him.

20
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:42,122
O God of the high Gods...

21
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:47,162
behold the talisman with which
you created the world and all things.

22
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:56,521
O God of Gods...

23
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,841
it has become too powerful for us...

24
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:04,201
and we must destroy it
before it destroys the world.

25
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,360
Forgive us now
as we send it out of the light...

26
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,680
from which it draws its power...

27
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,920
into eternal darkness.

28
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,919
Forgive us.

29
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,233
Come on.

30
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:13,232
So this can make worlds...

31
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:17,432
or shatter them by storm and earthquake.

32
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:21,712
Have it lifted out.

33
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,111
Lift it out!

34
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,630
Touch it.

35
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:53,787
So it is true. Only women may touch it.

36
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:57,427
The cover.

37
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,026
Take it out.

38
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:22,426
Great queen,
what shall we do with the prisoners?

39
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:34,785
- No!
- No!

40
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:01,424
Come.

41
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:24,983
Horses.

42
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:25,617
The talisman's stolen.

43
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:29,337
Must destroy the talisman.

44
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:34,377
We must find my sister. Take me.

45
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:38,576
I know where she is. Please.

46
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:13,575
Magnificent.

47
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,854
You have nothing more to learn, Sonja.

48
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:31,214
You are the master of the master.

49
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,454
Never have l seen your equal.

50
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,733
You must learn to like men a little better.

51
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:54,573
They are not all evil.

52
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:58,253
We must judge by our own experience,
Grand Master.

53
00:15:58,293 --> 00:15:59,413
I know.

54
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:04,172
But in life, all is not swordplay.

55
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:08,972
Hatred of men in a lovely young woman...

56
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:12,212
it could be your downfall.

57
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,292
I don't hate all men, Grand Master.

58
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:20,932
That would have been music to my ears
30 years ago.

59
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:22,731
Come.

60
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:27,651
A great swordsman
must have a great sword.

61
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:42,211
Choose.

62
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,250
A gift from the Grand Master.

63
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,930
<i>Sonja.</i>

64
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,130
What is it, Red Sonja?

65
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:32,048
I'm looking for Red Sonja.

66
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:48,607
- I am Sonja.
- Your sister's dying.

67
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,967
I'll take you to her.

68
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:47,285
Varna.

69
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:56,004
Thank God.

70
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,644
I've lived long enough.

71
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:02,204
The talisman's stolen.

72
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:05,684
All the priests massacred.

73
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:09,763
- We fought...
- Rest, Varna. Later we can talk.

74
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,483
There's no time. Listen.

75
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:17,363
The talisman has terrible power...

76
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:20,483
which grows in the light.

77
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,123
In 13 days it could destroy the world...

78
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,882
by storm and earthquake.

79
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:41,682
You must destroy the talisman, Sonja.

80
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:46,562
Send it into darkness. Swear that you will.

81
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:48,162
I swear.

82
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,722
Who took it?

83
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:52,961
I don't know.

84
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:57,761
There was a woman with a gold mask.

85
00:19:58,721 --> 00:19:59,921
Soldiers.

86
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:02,881
Where did they take it? North? South?

87
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,960
She's dead.
And the living have work to do.

88
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,320
Her work, my work, is no concern of yours.

89
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,200
- Who are you, anyway?
- My name is Kalidor.

90
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,360
I befriended your sister, remember?

91
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,559
I'm a friend of yours, too.

92
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:38,399
I thank you for what you did for my sister.
You will be rewarded.

93
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:41,199
I'm no mercenary. Nobody pays me.

94
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,839
If l think somebody owes me something,
l take it.

95
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:29,237
Someone is using the talisman.

96
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:35,037
- What place is that?
- Hablok. It's a great city.

97
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:42,116
Where are you going?

98
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:44,356
Hablok.

99
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:47,956
Wait. I'll come with you.

100
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:51,716
Why should you? It's no business of yours.

101
00:21:52,036 --> 00:21:53,596
And neither am I.

102
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:55,916
You may be wrong on both counts.

103
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:59,475
I know you're a brave girl,
but danger is my trade.

104
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,715
Then l'll learn it by myself.

105
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:08,755
Don't make me angry, Kalidor.

106
00:22:09,435 --> 00:22:11,475
I don't need any man's help.

107
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:35,474
Don't shake it, fool. Hold it steady!
Can you do nothing right?

108
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:37,754
Still, you great idiot.

109
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:40,513
I'm trying, Your Highness.

110
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:45,473
Clumsy oaf. Stupid, dumb,
useless, selfish beast!

111
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,593
Quickly, come. Come to me.

112
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:51,433
Don't give me orders, slave.
I'll have you hung by the heels.

113
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:53,673
Anyway, it's too slippery.

114
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:57,713
Do you want me to fall
in that boiling mud? You numskull.

115
00:22:58,393 --> 00:23:00,992
I'll try to swing it around. Now.

116
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:03,672
- Hold still, boy.
- Boy?

117
00:23:07,832 --> 00:23:10,592
Steady, Your Majesty. Steady.

118
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,831
Jump off. Jump.

119
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,671
What about me?

120
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:37,351
Get back here and stop playing the fool.

121
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:41,390
I hear and obey, master of the world.
I'm coming.

122
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:12,349
Lucky for you that this person came along.

123
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:15,509
Reward her, and tell her who l am.

124
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:21,389
His Royal Highness, the Prince Tarn,
Great Lord of Hablok...

125
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,628
keeper of the spotless throne...

126
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,148
great elephant who fertilizes the world
with his...

127
00:24:27,228 --> 00:24:29,348
l've told you not to say that.

128
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:32,188
Do it again, and l'll have you impaled.

129
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,468
Well, reward her, fool.

130
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:51,027
From the look of your kingdom, Prince,
you need this more than l do.

131
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,347
Did she address me?

132
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,307
What happened?

133
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:02,147
Queen Gedren attacked us
is what happened.

134
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:05,026
Gedren? Queen Gedren?

135
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:06,826
That's right.

136
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:11,826
She knocked down half the city with her
new weapon and demanded our surrender.

137
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:13,426
My army ran away.

138
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:16,146
Do they want to live forever?

139
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,266
I refused to surrender.

140
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:21,226
So she knocked down the other half.

141
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:25,426
Falkon, since everyone is dead
or run away...

142
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:28,345
you shall escort me
to the mountains tomorrow.

143
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:30,265
I shall raise a new army...

144
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:33,585
and crush this upstart Gedren underfoot.

145
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:36,905
Where can l find her, this Queen Gedren?

146
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:39,745
In Burkubane, the land of eternal night.

147
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:41,105
How do l get there?

148
00:25:41,145 --> 00:25:45,025
There's a long scenic way, and there's
the short way through Brytag's toll road.

149
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:48,064
I'll take Brytag's toll road.
Which way is that?

150
00:25:49,144 --> 00:25:51,944
Straight north from here.
You can't miss it.

151
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,704
But it's worth a try.

152
00:25:56,664 --> 00:25:59,424
Ask the woman
if she wishes to join my army.

153
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:01,984
We'll probably need a cook.

154
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:05,104
Your Highness is too kind,
but l travel alone.

155
00:26:06,424 --> 00:26:10,103
Dismiss the woman, Falkon.
I shall dine in an hour.

156
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:18,223
May l give you a word of advice?

157
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:21,623
Put him over your knee
and beat some manners into him.

158
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,103
You wouldn't happen to have a tablecloth,
would you?

159
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,260
Brytag, come down and open the gate.

160
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,380
Not so fast, redhead.

161
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,100
I'm up here
where l can get a better look at you.

162
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,420
I have no time to waste, Brytag.

163
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,819
I have plenty. Come up, l say.

164
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:19,457
- Come here, wench.
- Why should I?

165
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:26,057
Because l am Brytag. This is my land.

166
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:29,577
All that pass through pay me tribute.

167
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:32,217
- How much, Brytag?
- Who mentioned money?

168
00:28:33,097 --> 00:28:34,616
Tribute, l said.

169
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,696
The tender kind all women pay to Brytag.

170
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:48,616
Suppose l don't.

171
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:52,696
Suppose, instead, l open up
that great fat belly of yours.

172
00:28:56,975 --> 00:28:58,375
You hear that?

173
00:28:58,815 --> 00:29:01,175
She's going to open up my great...

174
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:06,895
Woman, l have fought 177 men.

175
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:10,015
Only one survives, and he has got no legs.

176
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,575
You dare to mock at Brytag?

177
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:15,135
That takes no daring.

178
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:22,454
But when l've killed you,
will your warriors let me go unharmed?

179
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:24,934
When you've killed me?

180
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:31,294
When this wench has killed me,
you will let her go unharmed, won't you?

181
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:32,774
Aye.

182
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:39,333
See?

183
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:44,093
So, wench.

184
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:51,253
I'm gonna feed your eyes
to the birds, red hair.

185
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:53,293
I don't need eyes to find you.

186
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,773
I can smell you at a hundred paces.

187
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,850
I will tell the future in your entrails,
red woman.

188
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,930
I know my future. You have none.

189
00:31:38,248 --> 00:31:39,648
Hold on, Sonja.

190
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,647
Sonja, come on.

191
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:08,526
Look out!

192
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,845
This way. Follow me!

193
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:34,005
- Get away. Go!
- What about you?

194
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,765
I can hold them. Go!

195
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,085
Hurry! Stop them!

196
00:33:14,403 --> 00:33:16,123
Release me, ruffian!

197
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:17,923
Release me, l say!

198
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:21,963
- Tell us where it is.
- I'll have your head for this!

199
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,443
Don't be shy.

200
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:28,082
The gold, boy. Where's the gold?

201
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:30,682
There is no gold, ruffian.

202
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:38,402
I tell you, l have no gold!

203
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:43,802
You have fine raiment, boy,
almost as resplendent as mine.

204
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:47,042
And you expect me to believe
you're penniless?

205
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:51,161
I'll have you know, villain,
l am Prince Tarn of Hablok.

206
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:54,881
My subjects will see
to your punishment for this.

207
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:59,361
And a grievous punishment it will be,
impertinent oaf!

208
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:01,041
Your subjects?

209
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:03,561
My kingdom is greater than yours.

210
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,521
And l have but four.

211
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:09,760
Pull him!

212
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:17,317
- Are you all right, your sovereign Majesty?
- Yes, clumsy oaf.

213
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:20,077
Why did you leave him?

214
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:22,437
We needed food. I went hunting.

215
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:24,557
You could have taken him with you.

216
00:35:24,637 --> 00:35:27,517
Tell her, Falkon,
that l don't care for hunting.

217
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:31,557
He doesn't care for hunting.

218
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,595
Treasure to the vaults,
prisoners to the dungeons.

219
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,155
Take the talisman back
to the Chamber of Lights.

220
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:08,915
Very well, my queen.

221
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,070
Perhaps fewer candles...

222
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,630
would be advisable, Your Majesty.

223
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,110
Why?

224
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,630
The stronger the light, the greater
the power of the talisman grows.

225
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,710
I want more light here, not less.

226
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,310
But it is dangerously powerful already,
great queen.

227
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,590
- Look what it did to Hablok.
- Yes. Very satisfying.

228
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:01,069
But l want its full power
when we march against Toktyl, Ikol.

229
00:38:01,149 --> 00:38:02,509
Its full power.

230
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:05,709
- It will be beyond our control, Majesty.
- Majesty!

231
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:08,389
Enemies are approaching
the outer empire.

232
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:45,904
It's the Prince of Hablok, Your Majesty...

233
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,824
with his army.

234
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,144
Insects.

235
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,864
That girl.

236
00:39:57,344 --> 00:40:00,584
So she escaped the fire. How fortunate.

237
00:40:01,824 --> 00:40:06,183
Ikol, l want her alive
without so much as a scratch on her skin.

238
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,343
Shall l send out a small ambush party?

239
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:12,583
No.

240
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:16,263
We'll wait till they get a little closer.

241
00:40:32,022 --> 00:40:35,982
Burkubane, the land of perpetual night.

242
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,982
Falkon, proclaim my arrival...

243
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,542
and the defiance of Queen Gedren.

244
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:43,542
Sound your trumpet.

245
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:45,702
Keep quiet...

246
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:48,741
at least till we find a way across.

247
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,621
Princes do not sneak in
on their enemies like thieves.

248
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:55,901
You don't know
much about princes, do you?

249
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,860
You wait here with the horses.

250
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,939
I want to test this bridge first.

251
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:32,099
Or whatever it is.

252
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:12,857
It looks safe enough.
We'll lead the horses across.

253
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:17,777
Now hear me, Gedren!

254
00:42:17,857 --> 00:42:20,417
It is I, Prince Tarn of Hablok...

255
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:23,977
to revenge myself
on the tyrant of Burkubane.

256
00:42:24,537 --> 00:42:27,857
Be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.

257
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:30,337
How dare you, woman?

258
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,256
I'll show you how l dare.

259
00:42:32,336 --> 00:42:34,776
This should have been done long ago.

260
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:38,336
No. If you must hit someone, then hit me.

261
00:42:41,296 --> 00:42:43,376
You're not worth the effort, boy.

262
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:45,456
Boy?

263
00:42:45,536 --> 00:42:48,216
Yes, boy. You'll never be anything else...

264
00:42:48,296 --> 00:42:51,736
till you learn gratitude
and self-sacrifice, like Falkon.

265
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,495
He's a real man.

266
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:04,695
She didn't mean it, my prince.
She doesn't know your fine qualities.

267
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:23,454
Take that, ruffian.

268
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:38,693
Take that, you ruffian.

269
00:43:53,253 --> 00:43:55,013
Practicing, Highness?

270
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:58,772
I thought princes did everything so well,
they wouldn't need to.

271
00:43:59,252 --> 00:44:01,852
I was disarmed by those ruffians
the other day.

272
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,932
I noticed. So? It needn't be fatal.

273
00:44:05,372 --> 00:44:07,572
I am disarmed. Kill me. Come on.

274
00:44:08,452 --> 00:44:09,652
Come on!

275
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:20,571
You're meant to be
using your sword. Remember?

276
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:29,491
Simple, isn't it?

277
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:32,091
But it's not in the rule book.

278
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:35,291
You see, fencing and fighting
are two different things.

279
00:44:35,771 --> 00:44:37,850
You need to learn them both.

280
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,690
Will you teach me to fence and to fight?

281
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,690
If you please?

282
00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:01,969
Spoken like a prince.

283
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:09,689
You were disarmed
because you hold the hilt too tight.

284
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:11,809
Grip gently. See?

285
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:17,729
Gently. I see. Like this?

286
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,288
Your Highness learns fast.

287
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:25,568
I think we'll continue
your fencing lessons another time.

288
00:45:26,888 --> 00:45:28,608
We've an early start.

289
00:45:29,128 --> 00:45:30,848
You are very beautiful.

290
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:34,328
When l am king of Hablok,
l shall have you at my court.

291
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:37,448
You will? My, the honor.

292
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:40,927
I may even make you my queen.

293
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:43,407
But l'm still young.

294
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:45,647
We shall have to see.

295
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:20,086
They will reach
the Ithian Cavern tomorrow.

296
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:22,845
We must force them to take shelter there.

297
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:26,085
The killing machine will do the rest.

298
00:46:26,165 --> 00:46:28,485
Yes. They'll make fine fish food.

299
00:46:30,045 --> 00:46:31,605
But not the girl.

300
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:35,445
I want that beauty here with me.
See to it that she is spared.

301
00:46:36,805 --> 00:46:39,565
I'll do my best, my queen.

302
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:42,965
The machine is difficult to control.

303
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:46,404
One cannot guarantee
that something will not go wrong.

304
00:46:48,124 --> 00:46:51,284
If it does, you will be its next victim.

305
00:47:03,044 --> 00:47:06,763
The talisman, Ikol. We need a storm.

306
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:09,563
A little one.

307
00:47:21,123 --> 00:47:22,963
We should be out in the storm.

308
00:47:23,963 --> 00:47:25,882
Why? This is shelter, isn't it?

309
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:29,962
I haven't got time to shelter.
I've four days left to find the talisman.

310
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,802
Besides, something drove us in here...

311
00:47:35,162 --> 00:47:36,882
every bit of the way.

312
00:47:38,162 --> 00:47:40,682
I noticed it, but l'm not complaining.

313
00:47:43,882 --> 00:47:45,242
Where's Tarn?

314
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:49,841
He promised not to wander.
Dry off, l'll go find him.

315
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:57,201
Look at this.

316
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:06,081
It must be the biggest in the world.

317
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,240
Could be fake.
There's a lot of bad stuff around.

318
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,760
This pearl can rebuild Hablok...

319
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,840
fill its treasury, buy me an army.

320
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,960
Dig it out!

321
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,800
Your Highness,
it may belong to somebody.

322
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,720
It does, and he wants it now!

323
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:30,159
Yeah.

324
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:38,319
Use your dagger, fool!

325
00:48:58,678 --> 00:48:59,998
What are you doing?

326
00:49:00,078 --> 00:49:02,678
Falkon, Highness, look at the water!

327
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:06,478
Come on. Put your back into it.

328
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:09,997
It won't budge.
Maybe it wasn't meant to come out.

329
00:49:10,357 --> 00:49:13,237
The water is rising.
You must get out of here.

330
00:49:23,357 --> 00:49:26,317
- This way! Make for the stairs!
- Come, my prince!

331
00:49:56,315 --> 00:49:58,395
- Get out of the water!
- Yes.

332
00:50:00,555 --> 00:50:02,555
Climb up here, my prince.

333
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:35,673
Tarn!

334
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,793
I'm coming, my prince!

335
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:49,593
Let go!

336
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:18,831
Where is she?

337
00:52:55,627 --> 00:52:57,907
I can't kill it! It's a machine!

338
00:53:13,826 --> 00:53:15,866
Sonja, we have to blind it!

339
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:18,746
It's our only chance!

340
00:53:47,064 --> 00:53:49,544
Falkon, get out! It can't see!

341
00:54:35,582 --> 00:54:38,022
There. Keep it covered.

342
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,822
Why have you been following me?

343
00:54:41,902 --> 00:54:44,262
To see that you reach the talisman safely.

344
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:45,461
Why?

345
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:48,821
I have to be sure
that the talisman is destroyed.

346
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:51,781
Centuries ago, the high lords of Arcadia...

347
00:54:51,861 --> 00:54:54,661
had entrusted the talisman
to the priestesses...

348
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:57,021
because only women may touch it.

349
00:54:57,341 --> 00:55:00,261
But to guard it,
or to destroy it if need be...

350
00:55:00,821 --> 00:55:03,221
is still the duty of the High Lord.

351
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:05,341
You? The High Lord?

352
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,300
I was coming to the temple
to see the talisman destroyed...

353
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,540
when l found your sister dying...

354
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,140
and learnt that the talisman
had been stolen.

355
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,500
So she guided me to you.

356
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,020
Why didn't you tell me who you were?

357
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,900
You didn't seem to want a man's help.

358
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,939
But you needed it,
so that's why l followed you.

359
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,259
I had to be sure you reached the talisman.

360
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:32,179
I see.

361
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:36,259
I misunderstood.
I thought you had another reason.

362
00:55:43,779 --> 00:55:44,939
I did.

363
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:57,258
No. I'm under a vow.

364
00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:03,778
No man may have me
unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.

365
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:12,857
So the only man that can have you
is one who has tried to kill you.

366
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:16,497
That's logic.

367
00:56:43,576 --> 00:56:47,336
If you yield only to a conqueror,
then prepare to be conquered.

368
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,815
Don't be a fool. I don't want to kill you.

369
00:57:02,455 --> 00:57:03,575
Try it.

370
00:57:11,574 --> 00:57:12,814
Come on.

371
00:57:21,894 --> 00:57:24,494
Keep it down over there.
We're trying to sleep.

372
00:57:44,173 --> 00:57:45,773
Are you all right?

373
00:57:45,973 --> 00:57:48,853
Yes, Prince. We were just practicing.

374
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,493
Then let me down!

375
00:57:58,572 --> 00:57:59,852
Thank you.

376
00:59:19,688 --> 00:59:21,688
Why does she fight so hard?

377
00:59:22,288 --> 00:59:24,168
She doesn't want to win.

378
01:00:59,004 --> 01:01:02,763
Gedren's army.
Another kingdom enslaved.

379
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:33,402
The talisman! We must find a way in.

380
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:48,241
We'll have to climb.

381
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:54,321
Three of us should go in.

382
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:57,881
Who'll stand guard this doorway,
the post of danger?

383
01:01:58,721 --> 01:02:00,681
- Falkon?
- Me? Here?

384
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:03,561
I don't know what's coming out that door.
No, l am going up.

385
01:02:03,641 --> 01:02:04,800
Coward!

386
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,240
I'll take my chances in there.

387
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,320
And l have to go in.

388
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:21,960
I'll stay.

389
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:31,679
Take care, Your Highness.

390
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:48,838
Thank you.

391
01:04:07,915 --> 01:04:09,835
Tomorrow, l start my diet.

392
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,074
Majesty, the talisman
is almost beyond control.

393
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,594
We must bury it in the dark
before it is too late!

394
01:04:19,674 --> 01:04:23,314
It'll be buried when l have no further use
for it, and that time is not yet.

395
01:04:23,394 --> 01:04:27,114
But it will kill us all!
O God, Majesty, what do you want?

396
01:04:27,394 --> 01:04:30,794
Our vaults are brimming with gold.
Great states live in terror of us!

397
01:04:30,874 --> 01:04:33,353
- What more is there?
- The world, Ikol!

398
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:36,713
Today we took another piece
of the city of Toktyl.

399
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:40,353
But l have wider claims
and the talisman will enforce them!

400
01:04:41,353 --> 01:04:43,833
Madness. There will be no world.

401
01:04:44,873 --> 01:04:47,473
There will be no world.

402
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:48,470
We must find the talisman.
Only l can touch it, remember.

403
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:53,830
You take that way, l'll go the other way.
Falkon, you take the center.

404
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:06,829
How's the food around here?

405
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:09,149
Who are you?

406
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:16,386
- Look for the talisman.
- Yeah. Right.

407
01:07:36,825 --> 01:07:39,624
- Ikol, Gedren's black spider.
- You.

408
01:07:39,704 --> 01:07:42,104
Yes. Prince Tarn of Hablok:

409
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:45,384
The city you blasted
with your filthy sorcery.

410
01:07:49,144 --> 01:07:51,984
So the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.

411
01:07:52,744 --> 01:07:54,464
Out of my way, child.

412
01:07:55,384 --> 01:07:58,344
So that you can desert,
like the thief you are?

413
01:07:59,704 --> 01:08:01,223
With my gold?

414
01:08:02,023 --> 01:08:03,463
Hablok's gold?

415
01:08:09,303 --> 01:08:12,703
Now that was unmannerly
of Your Highness...

416
01:08:13,303 --> 01:08:16,623
and rude little boys need correction...

417
01:08:16,943 --> 01:08:20,023
if they're going to grow up into...

418
01:08:27,862 --> 01:08:31,502
l'm afraid Your Highness' growth
is going to be stunted permanently.

419
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:39,542
Now, yield, Black Spider.

420
01:09:26,019 --> 01:09:27,739
Where's Queen Gedren?

421
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:30,579
She's gone. I'm so glad that you've come.

422
01:09:33,019 --> 01:09:35,979
Please, will you protect me?
I'm so frightened.

423
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:51,858
Gedren! Where are you?

424
01:09:53,938 --> 01:09:57,938
So the Prince of Hablok
honors us with his presence unwisely.

425
01:09:58,258 --> 01:10:02,538
How many are with you?
Tell me! How many are with you?

426
01:10:03,298 --> 01:10:06,057
- How many?
- Enough, Gedren!

427
01:10:10,577 --> 01:10:13,537
Get back, or Hablok will need
an heir to the throne.

428
01:10:13,617 --> 01:10:15,537
And your own throne, Gedren.

429
01:10:15,617 --> 01:10:19,417
Unless the talisman goes into the dark,
your whole kingdom will...

430
01:10:23,657 --> 01:10:25,857
Prince, get Kalidor and Falkon.

431
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,496
There's a way behind the throne.

432
01:10:31,056 --> 01:10:33,256
The talisman, Gedren. Quickly!

433
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:37,656
You are a fool.
We could have ruled the world together.

434
01:10:37,736 --> 01:10:42,096
Now l shall rule alone,
and you will die for what you did to me.

435
01:10:42,176 --> 01:10:43,536
What l did?

436
01:10:44,016 --> 01:10:46,736
You slaughtered my parents like cattle.

437
01:10:46,816 --> 01:10:49,255
My brother, my sister!

438
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,135
Vermin! What were their lives
compared to this?

439
01:10:53,175 --> 01:10:56,575
You are mad!
The talisman will destroy you.

440
01:11:53,452 --> 01:11:55,092
Up here, Sonja.

441
01:11:56,972 --> 01:11:58,172
Up here.

442
01:14:05,926 --> 01:14:09,686
Kalidor, Falkon, this way! Hurry!

443
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,924
Down this hallway!

444
01:14:51,084 --> 01:14:53,124
Sonja. Over here.

445
01:15:05,883 --> 01:15:07,323
Falkon, help.

446
01:15:21,442 --> 01:15:22,842
Prince Tarn, come back.

447
01:15:22,922 --> 01:15:26,362
I am here, Gedren. Death to all tyrants.

448
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:55,521
Sonja, help me!

449
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:57,201
I'm trapped!

450
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,760
Sonja! Behind you!

451
01:17:15,277 --> 01:17:16,957
I can't get through.

452
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:22,557
Falkon, pull her through. I'll hold the gate.

453
01:18:22,634 --> 01:18:24,874
Follow me. This is the way out.

454
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:33,313
How do you know, Highness?

455
01:18:33,393 --> 01:18:35,993
Because this is the way
l came in, you clown.

456
01:18:47,393 --> 01:18:49,113
Here's the way through.

457
01:18:49,193 --> 01:18:50,552
Go. Quickly!

458
01:19:13,751 --> 01:19:15,031
The door doesn't move.

459
01:19:15,111 --> 01:19:16,311
How does it open?

460
01:19:16,391 --> 01:19:18,231
I know. Leave it to me.

461
01:19:19,111 --> 01:19:20,911
No! Come back, Prince!

462
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:33,950
He's done it.

463
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:37,350
We can't leave him.
Wait here, my prince. Don't go away.

464
01:19:41,390 --> 01:19:43,750
Save yourselves! Run for it!

465
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:46,390
You, too, Falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!

466
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:48,710
Run! Run for it!

467
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:51,390
I'm not leaving here without you,
my prince.

468
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:56,749
Give me your hand. Reach. I'll get you out.

469
01:21:04,466 --> 01:21:06,226
Hablok is over there.

470
01:21:06,386 --> 01:21:09,266
When it's rebuilt,
you must come to visit us.

471
01:21:09,466 --> 01:21:11,786
I'm sure to need a queen someday.

472
01:21:11,826 --> 01:21:13,386
You'll find one.

473
01:21:13,586 --> 01:21:16,625
Whoever she is, Prince, choose carefully.

474
01:21:17,185 --> 01:21:21,585
I make it a rule never to take a woman
unless she can beat me in a fair fight.

475
01:21:22,145 --> 01:21:25,145
That's a challenge
l might think about someday.

476
01:21:25,905 --> 01:21:27,625
What about right now?

477
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:34,825
Why not?

478
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,263
Come along, Falkon.

479
01:22:08,063 --> 01:22:08,983
Come on.

480
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:14,550
With My Pleasure
Ammar Schwarzenegger
