00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,460
<i>Hello. Welcome back to Group Hug.</i>

3
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,563
<i>I'm your host, Ken Hyman, touching you, touching me.</i>

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,371
<i>My guest today is psychologist and author, Dr. Richard Clayton.</i>

5
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:22,939
<i>He has written a new book titled Ready, Set, Let Go. A Guide to Anger Management.</i>

6
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,713
<i>Doctor, you first applied the methods described in your book</i>

7
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,516
<i>to patients in your own private care. Is that correct?</i>

8
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,888
<i>Yes, I was, uh, trying to solve some of my own issues</i>

9
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,451
and, uh, well, in doing so, I... I discovered something that worked so well

10
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,963
<i>I thought I would use it to help other people.</i>

11
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,227
<i>I'd like to open the lines up to callers.</i>

12
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,293
<i>If anyone out there is dealing with anger issues,</i>

13
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,703
<i>Dr. Richard Clayton is standing by.</i>

14
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,742
<i>And we have a call. Hello?</i>

15
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,972
<i>Yeah, I got a little bit of a problem.</i>

16
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,604
<i>You know what my problem is?</i>

17
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,376
<i>This used to be a rock station</i>

18
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,408
<i>and now we've got Mr. Touchy-Feely here talking out of his ass!</i>

19
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,251
<i>You suck, Hyman. I'm gonna slash your tires!</i>

20
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,483
Don't cut him off.

21
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,321
Uh, Caller. What is it exactly about the show

22
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,793
that, uh, that makes you so angry?

23
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,228
<i>That it sucks!</i>

24
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,825
Okay, good. Now, do you honestly think that slashing Mr. Hyman's tires

25
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,597
is gonna make you feel any better?

26
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,002
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I think it will.</i>

27
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,769
In fact, many of the things that we do when we're angry

28
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:26,778
don't make us feel any better at all. They often make us feel worse.

29
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,780
<i>We are in control of our emotions,</i>

30
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,306
<i>not the other way round. The first step of taking control of our lives</i>

31
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,252
<i>is learning to master the emotional self.</i>

32
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,586
What're you staring? Eyes front. Let's go, jackass.

33
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,183
<i>I'd like you to do something for me.</i>

34
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,695
<i>I'd like you to close your eyes,</i>

35
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,665
<i>take a deep breath, repeat after me.</i>

36
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,826
Ready?

37
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,870
Ready.

38
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,303
- Set.
- Set.

39
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,601
Let go.

40
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,663
Let go.

41
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,438
- Let go.
- Let go.

42
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,440
How do you feel?

43
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,573
Mmm. Let go.

44
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,844
Yeah.

45
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,681
<i>I feel real good.</i>

46
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,519
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

47
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,921
That's all the time we have for on Group Hug today.

48
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,463
I'd like to thank our guest, Dr. Richard Clayton.

49
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,761
<i>The book is Ready, Set, Let Go.</i>

50
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,596
<i>It's available at better book stores everywhere.</i>

51
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,830
<i>I'm Ken Hyman, touching you, touching me.</i>

52
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,064
<i>'Till next time.</i>

53
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,207
You were great in there, Doc.

54
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,176
Thank you, honey. It's just... It's all so exciting.

55
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,303
In three weeks

56
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,506
I'll be married to the most wonderful girl.

57
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,844
Could life be any sweeter?

58
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,578
Yeah, you could be me.

59
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,876
<i>I don't think we have enough aluminum in our lives.</i>

60
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,680
<i>I think that's copper, isn't it?</i>

61
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,744
Mercury.

62
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,053
<i>Mercury? Well done, Ellen.</i>

63
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,025
Thank you.

64
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,288
<i>So, Ellen,</i>

65
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,326
pretty soon you'll be part of the Clayton family. Ha ha ha.

66
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,026
How does it feel?

67
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,968
Well, it's an honor. I love your son very much.

68
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:35,474
<i>That's so very sweet. But, um, what do you think of Richard?</i>

69
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,999
<i>Swish. Two points!</i>

70
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,012
Give it up, Mom. Come on.

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,810
Not at the table, darling.

72
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,751
<i>The entire public welfare system should be abolished.</i>

73
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,516
<i>That's easy for you to say. You're white.</i>

74
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,525
<i>And you're the son of a wealthy industrialist. As am I.</i>

75
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,585
Some people are born into disadvantage because of their background

76
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,722
<i>or the color of their skin.</i>

77
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,996
<i>Yes. It all sounds like the same bunch of typical liberal claptrap.</i>

78
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,661
<i>Thank you, Rosa.</i>

79
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,035
Thank you very much. You're a good woman.

80
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,041
Your people are, are a fine people, a proud people.

81
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,439
She doesn't understand what you're saying, Richard.

82
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,004
Everyone understands the language of respect, Mother.

83
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,573
Give it a rest. Have some brandy.

84
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,482
No, thank you. I don't drink anymore.

85
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:25,013
How a son of mine turned into such a bleeding heart, I will never know.

86
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,820
Maybe he gets it from his father.

87
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,326
<i>If that were the case,</i>

88
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,225
<i>then I'd have no compassion whatsoever.</i>

89
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,888
Not necessarily.

90
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,365
Uh, Mitch, I think you've had one too many.

91
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,767
<i>But isn't time he knew the truth?</i>

92
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,826
About what?

93
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,133
Mitchell.

94
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,173
About the bear.

95
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,573
<i>Bear? What bear? What is he talking about?</i>

96
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,805
Maybe it's best if I show you.

97
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,676
Mitch, Mitch. Get back here.

98
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,710
Where's he going?

99
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,721
Maybe we should just tell him.

100
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:57,881
Tell me what?

101
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,858
Richard, we didn't wanna tell you like this,

102
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,895
<i>but I suppose there's no easy way.</i>

103
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:08,628
<i>And with the wedding coming up, I suppose it's time that, um, that you know the truth.</i>

104
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,228
<i>Rosa, déjanos solos.</i>

105
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:15,896
<i>Although, uh,</i>

106
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:19,741
we loved both you and Mitch, uh, equally,

107
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,940
and we raised both of you as our own,

108
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,815
I'm... not your father,

109
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,683
strictly speaking.

110
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,220
I don't understand. What do you mean?

111
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,225
I'm not your biological mother, either.

112
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,163
This is some kind of joke?

113
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,166
It's not a joke, Richard.

114
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,226
I'm afraid you were adopted, son.

115
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,365
Adopted?

116
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,405
No, that's impossible.

117
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,446
<i>Not necessarily.</i>

118
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,972
I was up in the attic last night digging through some of our old stuff

119
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,779
and, uh, I found this.

120
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,545
What is this?

121
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,648
The orphanage found you on the doorstep

122
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,885
with just that one item.

123
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,689
<i>You were only a few months old.</i>

124
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,297
<i>Now, let's not make a big scene, Richard.</i>

125
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,803
Who's making a big scene? You... you're telling me that I'm adopted?

126
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,303
Richard, lower your voice.

127
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,203
I can't believe what I'm hearing!

128
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,004
It's in the past. What difference does it make?

129
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,771
Well, I'm 34 years old!

130
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,973
Did it cross your mind that I'd want this information earlier?

131
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,881
What for? So you could be traumatized?

132
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,186
<i>Ready, set,</i>

133
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,986
<i>let go.</i>

134
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,924
<i>Ready, set,</i>

135
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,526
Let go.

136
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,033
You okay, Doc?

137
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,593
Oh, I'm fine, bunny.

138
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,937
I'm better than fine. I'm good.

139
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,306
Honey, what are we listening to?

140
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,312
Uh, it's a meditation tape.

141
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,173
<i>Sea of Serenity.</i>

142
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,479
Soothing, isn't it?

143
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,611
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,819
<i>So, can you find them?</i>

145
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,328
<i>I've been doing this for over 25 years.</i>

146
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,593
Well, uh, how... how does one, uh, go about this?

147
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,397
In a case like this where there's not a lot to go on,

148
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,770
<i>we generally start by placing ads in the papers of the town you were found in,</i>

149
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,536
posting notices and such.

150
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,239
<i>If they're out there, and they're alive, I'll find them.</i>

151
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,508
Mmm. Good.

152
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,519
<i>Of course the layout's fantastic.</i>

153
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,216
I wish I had that much confidence in the publicity.

154
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,350
No, they're... they're taking care of you.

155
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,725
There's been plenty of publicity for this book signing on Monday.

156
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:55,563
<i>In fact, they even took out a great big ad in today's Tribune.</i>

157
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,804
Is that the picture they're gonna use?

158
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,998
Yeah.

159
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,008
Yeah, I'm such a stiff!

160
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,340
I don't really look like that, do I?

161
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,048
No, not at all.

162
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:15,178
Oh, I'm sorry. Just one second, Jeff. Hello?

163
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,722
<i>Spicer here. Good news!</i>

164
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,781
Looks like I found your birth parents.

165
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,553
Uh, that's terrific! Who are they?

166
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:29,701
A Frank and Agnes... I may be mispronouncing this. Manuree.

167
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,932
Yeah, Manuree. That would be French. Where do they live?

168
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,701
Pekin, Illinois. It's near Peoria.

169
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,402
That's just a few hours from here.

170
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,468
They'll love to come up for a visit. Want me to set this up?

171
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,979
Perfect! That's perfect.

172
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,415
We'll have a party. I'll introduce them to everyone.

173
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,076
Oh, this is a nice one.

174
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,350
Yeah, I hope so. Rich wants everything to be perfect.

175
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,891
He gets that look on his face if it's not.

176
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,893
Honey! We found them!

177
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,124
<i>Honey, we found them. My parents.</i>

178
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,687
They're gonna come next week!

179
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,699
They're gonna visit. We're gonna have a party!

180
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,497
<i>He found 'em. I don't know how he did it.</i>

181
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,869
I have to run. I have an appointment, but I'll call you later.

182
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,477
<i>Any sign of 'em yet?</i>

183
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,853
No, not yet.

184
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,223
I don't know what's keeping them.

185
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,636
You must be the Manoires.

186
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,497
Wow, I had no idea I was biracial,

187
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,703
but I've always identified with the struggle of the Black man.

188
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,609
And now I know why.

189
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,707
<i>So Dad, Mom, tell me about yourselves. I wanna know everything.</i>

190
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:56,153
Well, I graduated Berkeley in the Summer of Love. That's where I met your mom.

191
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,419
I was a slogan writer for many of the popular protest movements

192
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,153
of the '60s and '70s.

193
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,287
Remember, "Save the Whales," "No Nukes, Peace"?

194
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,352
Sure.

195
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,296
Those were mine.

196
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,560
Wow!

197
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,625
<i>And I'm the founder of the organization</i>

198
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,298
for Rethinking Ethnocentric Opinion. OREO.

199
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,206
Oh, such good work.

200
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,504
You two are amazing.

201
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,045
And you are the son we've always wanted.

202
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,980
I try, Mom. I really do.

203
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,045
<i>But tell me something. Why did you give me up?</i>

204
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,816
Well, it was all part of a sociological experiment.

205
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:37,454
We wanted to see if the child of open-minded, liberal humanitarians like ourselves

206
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:43,127
could flourish in a family of narrow-minded, hypercritical individuals like the Claytons.

207
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,362
I always knew it.

208
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,339
<i>I must say that you have passed with flying colors.</i>

209
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,034
Congratulations, son.

210
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,209
We love you.

211
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,779
Hey, Doc?

212
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:02,843
Yeah?

213
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,390
Do I look okay? I wanna make a good impression.

214
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,359
<i>Bunny, you look beautiful.</i>

215
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,826
My God, they're gonna love you.

216
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,624
I don't know how they could not love you.

217
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,528
I'm the one who should be worried.

218
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,430
If I'm a disappointment to them?

219
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,403
You have nothing to worry about because you're a great man.

220
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,804
You're gonna be the best wife ever.

221
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,868
Oh, my God, that's them!

222
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,243
Um, where's my jacket?

223
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,542
<i>You're wearing it.</i>

224
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,776
Right. Okay. Uh, do I look okay?

225
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,113
You look fine. Relax.

226
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,881
I can't believe I'm gonna meet my true parents.

227
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,217
Do I call them Mom and Dad?

228
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,757
No, just call them Mr. And Mrs. Manuree.

229
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,225
Right, of course. Of course.

230
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,818
Here I go.

231
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,460
Frank Menure.

232
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,368
You must be our son. How the hell are ya?

233
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,669
How the hell are ya? This is quite a moment for us.

234
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,206
I'm sorry. What was that name again?

235
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,677
Frank.

236
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,770
The part after that.

237
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,405
Menure. It's French.

238
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,183
Ah. Well, you must have the wrong house.

239
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,585
We're expecting the Manurees.

240
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,213
Richard.

241
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,993
And you must be Frank Jr.

242
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,551
Frank Jr.?

243
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,860
That's him alright. I'd recognize him anywhere.

244
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,627
He takes after my side of the family.

245
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,134
You call 'em circus freaks you come from a family?

246
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,663
It's better than that White Trash you come from. You shut up.

247
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,073
I can't believe it's really you!

248
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,306
<i>We sure got ourselves a family here.</i>

249
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,277
How old are you son, anyway? Thirty four?

250
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,343
<i>It was about that time when I started losing my hair.</i>

251
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,982
<i>But don't let it worry you because it's a sign of virility.</i>

252
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:50,961
<i>By the way, when it comes time to shop for a rug, I know a good place.</i>

253
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,431
You just tell 'im you're my boy, he'll cut you a deal.

254
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,860
Why don't we all step inside?

255
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,168
Nothing would please us more!

256
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,301
Can I help you with your, uh...

257
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,207
This here's a cheese ball.

258
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,906
I made it myself for the occasion. I hope you like it.

259
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,814
A cheese ball? Very nice.

260
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,114
<i>Back home I'm famous for my cheese balls.</i>

261
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,178
I make the best cheese ball in town. I can give you the recipe.

262
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,123
Nobody gives a damn what the hell you put in that rat ball,

263
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,956
except for maybe the Board of Health.

264
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,792
Why don't you shut the hell up?

265
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,594
He's an alcoholic.

266
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,566
I heard that.

267
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,468
Oh, we... we certainly appreciate the gesture, anyway.

268
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,132
Thank you. Don't we, Richard? Richard?

269
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,669
You certainly have a beautiful place here, son.

270
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,739
<i>It's got a certain je ne sais quoi.</i>

271
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,785
Yes siree, Bob.

272
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:51,221
You must be really raking in the dough, son. What's your racket, anyway?

273
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,622
I'm a psychologist and a writer.

274
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,289
Oh! How about that?

275
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,196
I knew these genes was good for somethin'.

276
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,564
What do you write, son?

277
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,502
Uh, I write books about psychology.

278
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,039
You ever write a book about dogs?

279
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,098
I sure do like a book about a dog.

280
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,108
No, I can't say that I have.

281
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,236
Huh.

282
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,304
If you do, let me know. I'll buy it.

283
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,483
I can't tell you how much Richard and I have been looking forward to this.

284
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,614
<i>Richard has a lot of questions for you. Don't you, Richard?</i>

285
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,716
<i>I don't know where to begin.</i>

286
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,954
You wore that damn hairnet, didn't ya?

287
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,018
<i>I thought I told you</i>

288
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,758
not to be wearing that damn hairnet when we meet our boy.

289
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,821
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

290
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,562
how ugly you look with that damn thing on your head?

291
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,570
<i>Any idea at all?</i>

292
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,630
I told you I have to wear the hairnet

293
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,268
to keep my hairs out of the cheese ball.

294
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,677
<i>I'm gonna count to three. And when I get to three,</i>

295
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,910
you better have that damn thing off your head.

296
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,577
One.

297
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,047
Two.

298
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,091
I ain't taking it off my head.

299
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,322
Three. That's it. I'm a-coming for it!

300
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,138
Why don't we all calm down here? I'm sure we can...

301
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,949
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

302
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,916
Ooh!

303
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,385
Oh, Richard, Oh, honey.

304
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,287
Are you happy now? Are you happy now?

305
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,587
We just met our son not five minutes ago

306
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,321
and you go beat him in the nuts with that damn rat ball!

307
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,692
You're gonna be alright.

308
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,631
Of course he's gonna be alright. He's tough like his old man.

309
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,192
I wish I had a nickel for every time I was laid low by one of them damn things.

310
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,328
I'd be a wealthy man.

311
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,736
Is there anything I can do?

312
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,104
Ain't you done enough already?

313
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,744
You're probably wondering why we gave you up, son.

314
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:58,476
Well, it's the same old story. You probably heard it a thousand times.

315
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,576
<i>Boy meets girl. They fall in love.</i>

316
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,177
Girl gets pregnant.

317
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,317
<i>Boy gets arrested for impersonating a meat inspector.</i>

318
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,524
I'm sorry. What was that last part?

319
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,257
It's a long story.

320
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,095
We just thought that you'd have a better chance in life

321
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,226
<i>with a family that could provide for ya.</i>

322
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,998
I hate to be the one to say this,

323
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,735
but I think the meat in this sauce has gone off. It don't taste right.

324
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,574
Oh, well actually it... it's not meat. It's seitan Parmesan.

325
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,107
Satan's what?

326
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,015
No. Seitan. Richard and I are vegans.

327
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,451
That means we don't consume animal products.

328
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,718
<i>Seitan's a form of wheat gluten. Kind of hard to explain.</i>

329
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,759
It... it's very healthy.

330
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,919
<i>If you don't like it, we can order out or...</i>

331
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,122
Oh no, we like it fine. Don't we, Frank?

332
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,289
Sure!

333
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,698
Thi... this is probably the best damn gluten I've ever tasted.

334
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,235
Mmm-hmm.

335
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:55,069
What do you do there, uh, for a living? You?

336
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,074
You can call me Dad, son.

337
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,268
Hmm.

338
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,278
<i>Well, I worked at the rodeo for a spell,</i>

339
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,042
'till I got tired of all the bull.

340
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,879
Get it?

341
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,885
<i>Bull? Rodeo?</i>

342
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,716
<i>That one's so old it's got a beard.</i>

343
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,119
So do you.

344
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,685
Anyway, after that, I took a job at the Peekaboo Carnival. That's where I met your mother.

345
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:21,028
<i>But lately I've been selling a household pest product door-to-door.</i>

346
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,694
It's called Scoot. Good stuff, that.

347
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,067
I got a case of it in the car if you're interested.

348
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,732
Oh, thank you. That's very thoughtful.

349
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,106
Are y'all planning on making us grandparents anytime soon?

350
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,941
Well, we have been discussing that option.

351
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,106
<i>Gonna take more that discussing.</i>

352
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,084
That ain't gotta get you knocked up!

353
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,621
Please, don't embarrass me in front of my boy.

354
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,984
<i>In all seriousness, though, there are some things you should know</i>

355
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,087
about our medical history if you're fixing the, you know, propagate.

356
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,222
What do you mean?

357
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,132
It's just there're some things that could get passed on to your young.

358
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:03,004
I myself suffer from a bacterial condition called Blackfoot.

359
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,269
<i>Blackfoot?</i>

360
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,810
Ever hear of athlete's foot?

361
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,072
A-ha.

362
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,341
It's that times ten.

363
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,350
<i>It's both chronic and incurable.</i>

364
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,785
Aside from that, there's the shrinking.

365
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,983
Shrinking?

366
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:23,494
Yes, ma'am. The Menure men tend to shrink after 40.

367
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,429
<i>On my side you got your mental afflictions,</i>

368
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,898
such as Tourette's Syndrome, schizophrenia,

369
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,027
and a rare condition known as Cokie's Disorder.

370
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,473
It's generally characterized by dementia, the murder impulse,

371
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,875
and an irrational fear of natural fibers.

372
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:44,439
<i>Well, if the Tourette Syndrome ain't kicked in yet, you're probably in the clear.</i>

373
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,043
<i>But I'd still keep an eye out for Cokie if I was you.</i>

374
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,251
<i>We want you to know, son, it's our greatest shame that we weren't there to raise ya.</i>

375
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:58,854
<i>But we intend to spend the rest of our lives making it up to ya.</i>

376
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,058
You really don't have to.

377
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,126
Oh, no. We insist.

378
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,208
You're not losing your hair.

379
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,843
Doc, you wanna talk about it?

380
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,011
Talk about what?

381
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,815
Oh, I'm fine. Fine.

382
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,386
Let's just go to sleep.

383
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:34,891
Look at it this way.

384
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,232
It's just two days and then you'll never have to see them again.

385
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,464
Yeah.

386
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,666
<i>Don't you hit me.</i>

387
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,403
Well, that's better.

388
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,027
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

389
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,537
<i>Who's yer Daddy? Who's yer Daddy?</i>

390
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,097
I sail in a sea of serenity.

391
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,541
<i>You're my Daddy !</i>

392
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,687
Morning, son. Sleep well?

393
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,926
Yeah, great.

394
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,889
See ya at breakfast.

395
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,206
<i>Did you see my tube of... Oh, there it is.</i>

396
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,887
What are you doing over there?

397
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,359
I'm a Menure.

398
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,124
No, you're not, honey.

399
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,324
<i>Yes, I am. I am a Menure.</i>

400
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,526
<i>No, you're a talented, intelligent man.</i>

401
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,762
It doesn't matter where you came from.

402
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,639
I... I'm sure they have many wonderful qualities

403
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,576
that have just yet to reveal themselves.

404
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,704
What are we gonna do about this party?

405
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,941
I told everybody that we had a big surprise.

406
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,349
I can't introduce these people to everyone we know.

407
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,183
Good God, Mitch'll have a field day.

408
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:43,551
<i>Ooh, he's big. Will you look at the critters?</i>

409
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,687
Those two are humping.

410
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,363
Look at that.

411
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,459
Look at 'em go.

412
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,300
That reminds me. Where's that pretty li'l gal of yours?

413
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,534
Oh, Ellen? She's out running an errand.

414
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,735
I think she should be back any minute.

415
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,779
<i>He's going at it.</i>

416
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,616
Hi. Can I have two tickets

417
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,586
to the Midsummer Night's Smackdown at the Rosemont Horizon tonight, please?

418
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,825
Uh, Junior, what are we listening to?

419
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,390
<i>It's Sea of Serenity, a meditation tape.</i>

420
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,299
It helps him relax.

421
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,634
<i>So, uh,</i>

422
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,074
we have a little surprise for you two.

423
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,133
For us?

424
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,179
We didn't know if you'd be interested

425
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,011
but there's a big wrestling event going on. It's the...

426
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,052
Midsummer Night's Smackdown.

427
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,282
And, uh, we went ahead and got tickets!

428
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,721
Wow!

429
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,918
How did you know we was wrestling fans?

430
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,324
Who isn't?

431
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,658
<i>Maybe it runs in the family.</i>

432
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,493
So the show time's at 8:00,

433
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,795
and, uh, we'll get you a map when we get home.

434
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,732
You're gonna come with us, ain't ya?

435
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,566
We'd love to. We, we...

436
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,969
We're not able to...

437
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,734
Yeah. There's this, uh,

438
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,776
it's a mee... It's like a meeting thing.

439
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,333
You wouldn't wanna be there.

440
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,402
It's a lot of small talk and schmoozing.

441
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,972
I don't mind schmoozing. I grew up on a farm.

442
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,178
<i>It's just that we, uh, only have the weekend</i>

443
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:19,747
<i>and we was hoping to kinda maximize our quality time together.</i>

444
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,555
<i>But this is just a couple hours I... I think.</i>

445
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,094
Couple hours, right?

446
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,271
You okay, Mom? You look bored.

447
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,315
This place is like a funeral home.

448
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,247
I thought you said it would be casual.

449
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,445
<i>Believe me, for these people it is casual.</i>

450
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,719
Grab his shorts!

451
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,061
<i>Grab 'em I Woo!</i>

452
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,157
We should try and move.

453
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,359
Woo!

454
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,928
Hey.

455
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,129
Hey!

456
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,505
Hey. What?

457
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:13,976
I'm worried about the time. It's getting late.

458
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,672
Relax. It's a long program.

459
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,271
We should try to speed things.

460
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,907
Don't these people have homes?

461
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,050
<i>Oh, dear,</i>

462
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,556
do you happen to know what your mother plans to wear for the wedding?

463
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,491
No, I don't. Why do you ask?

464
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,688
<i>There surely must be something in her closet without sequins.</i>

465
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,095
Mrs. Clayton, if you feel so strongly about it,

466
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,689
why don't you ask her yourself?

467
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:39,066
There's no need to be defensive. I was just making a suggestion.

468
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,764
Excuse me.

469
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,206
<i>So, Richard?</i>

470
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,733
<i>What was this big surprise that you promised us tonight?</i>

471
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,507
<i>Big surprise?</i>

472
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,412
Yeah! You said you had a big surprise.

473
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,073
Uh,

474
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,309
we're having a baby.

475
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,855
<i>Oh!</i>

476
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,151
What?

477
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,123
Not now, but she's not pregnant.

478
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,891
<i>But we will. She will be someday.</i>

479
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,058
Maybe tonight. Who knows?

480
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,700
<i>So, uh,</i>

481
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,240
who's up for charades?

482
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,809
<i>Dad, it... it's kind of late.</i>

483
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,777
Oh, it's not even 9:00.

484
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,710
Oh, let's play. Let's play.

485
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,049
What the hell is this?

486
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,715
Staring at her like she got knobs on her?

487
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,589
I was just being friendly.

488
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,720
<i>You've been pushing my buttons all day long.</i>

489
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,059
Where's the off button?

490
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,599
There ain't no off button. I'm gonna keep going.

491
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,328
I don't know what you're selling,

492
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,892
but there's no peddling here.

493
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,337
Oh, we're not selling anything, young man.

494
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,271
We just come here to visit our son.

495
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,334
Your son? Uh, Richard Clayton lives here.

496
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:57,074
That's... That's our boy! Frank Jr.

497
00:26:58,817 --> 00:26:59,943
You mean you're...

498
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,920
We're his parents! Can't you see the resemblance?

499
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,184
Yes, of course!

500
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,351
Uh, Hi. I'm Mitchell, uh, Richard's...

501
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,793
Frank Junior's adoptive brother.

502
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,263
Oh! Why didn't you say so?

503
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:17,301
Frank Menure. This is my wife Agnes. How the hell are ya?

504
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,631
How the hell are ya?

505
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,193
What was that name again?

506
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,205
- Frank.
- The last name.

507
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,798
Menure. It's French.

508
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:28,870
Uh, movie.

509
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,539
It's a movie.

510
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,772
Second word.

511
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,948
Terror.

512
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,082
Horror. Nausea.

513
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,989
<i>Is it Cape Fear?</i>

514
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,283
<i>It is Cape Fear.</i>

515
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,091
Yes, I'm hot tonight. Who's next?

516
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,325
<i>Richard, I always knew you were number two,</i>

517
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,994
but I never realized you were number two.

518
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,196
Swish, two points. Right. Come on.

519
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,899
Richard, who are those people?

520
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:59,705
<i>They're a couple of former patients of mine. Schizophrenic, delusional.</i>

521
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,177
I... I'll take care of it.

522
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,005
Well, your mother and her big mouth

523
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,483
got us thrown out for making a ruckus.

524
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,919
<i>She started mouthing off. I was just being friendly with somebody.</i>

525
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,219
You were flirting with that usherette.

526
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,953
I refuse to be a party to your delusion.

527
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,825
Ha! Can't even trust you around a plant.

528
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,422
I'd like to introduce Richard's very special guests.

529
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:26,368
His birth parents, the Menures. It's French, you know.

530
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,271
<i>Merci beaucoup. How the hell are ya?</i>

531
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,602
<i>How the hell are ya?</i>

532
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,040
What have you done?

533
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,978
<i>It's such a pleasure to meet all of you fine friends</i>

534
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,039
of our beloved son, Frank Jr.

535
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,813
That's Richard. Frank Menure Jr. to all of us.

536
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,253
Frank told us you all was a bunch of stiffs.

537
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,258
<i>But you all seem like friendly folks to me.</i>

538
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:51,056
<i>Any friend of Frank Jr.'s a friend of ours.</i>

539
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,394
<i>By the way, if you got any problems with critters,</i>

540
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,299
<i>just let me know. I sell a fine product called Scoot.</i>

541
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:01,031
It gets rid of your ticks, your fleas, your cockroaches, what have you.

542
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,472
<i>Just give me a buzz some time.</i>

543
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,704
Get it? Give me a buzz.

544
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,803
<i>How very thoughtful of you.</i>

545
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,144
How would you two like to meet the nice couple

546
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,275
who were so kind as to raise Frank Jr.?

547
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,376
Oh, nothing would please us more.

548
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:19,116
<i>Excellent. Mom, Dad? This is Frank and Agnes.</i>

549
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,988
Meet Douglas and Arleen Clayton.

550
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,085
Oh!

551
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,424
Oh!

552
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:30,093
I wanna thank you on behalf of myself and my wife and I

553
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,262
for doing such a great job with Frank Jr.

554
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,896
We just love him to death.

555
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,635
<i>He is a fine Christian man.</i>

556
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:41,839
Yes, sir. I myself I'm from the church of C and E.

557
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:45,906
Ask me what that stands for. C and E, ask me what it stands for.

558
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,076
Alright. What does it stand for?

559
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,022
Christmas and Easter. Get it?

560
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,753
The church of C and E is Christmas and Easter.

561
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,620
That's an old joke.

562
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:02,689
So is your face. Hey, Clayton, how about a swap?

563
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,962
<i>She may have a few miles on her,</i>

564
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,301
<i>but she gets you where you wanna go.</i>

565
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:12,639
Does Arleen get you where you wanna go? I bet she does, you old devil.

566
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,440
She looks like she's got some great suspension.

567
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,946
<i>Guys, this is Angela Minnola, Ellen's mother.</i>

568
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,883
Angela, the Menures.

569
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,286
What a pleasure. I love your dress.

570
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,948
<i>Thank you!</i>

571
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,721
<i>When is that wedding happening, anyway?</i>

572
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,160
We should get back to the game, right? Who's up?

573
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,164
Were you folks playing a game?

574
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,666
We were playing charade. You must join us.

575
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:38,892
Hell, yeah.

576
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,461
<i>Alrighty then. Prepare people.</i>

577
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,904
I'm an expert at this game.

578
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,475
It's a movie.

579
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,642
<i>Mother Jugs and Speed. Is it Mother Jugs and Speed?</i>

580
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,777
<i>Would you let the man get started?</i>

581
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,186
Will you shut the hell up?

582
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,857
It has four words.

583
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,053
<i>One. One. Rocky I. How the West Was Won.</i>

584
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,117
First word.

585
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,129
That would be The.

586
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,429
First word. Is that the first word?

587
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,833
That's the first word. Is The.

588
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,671
Second word.

589
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,072
<i>From Here to Eternity.</i>

590
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,406
Listening?

591
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,140
<i>Is it listening?</i>

592
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,340
Is it sound?

593
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:27,714
<i>Sound! Mother Jugs and Speed. Is it Mother Jugs and Speed?</i>

594
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,878
<i>No, no. American Gigolo.</i>

595
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,888
We saw that one at the drive-in.

596
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,221
Woo-wee! That Richard Gere. Oh, he is hot to trot.

597
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,762
We are trying to play an intelligent game here.

598
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,026
Then maybe you should leave the room.

599
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,436
Little word.

600
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,369
Of.

601
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,067
Oh, that was very nice.

602
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,411
<i>Yentl. Is it Yentl?</i>

603
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,251
I think it's the fourth word, Frank.

604
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,684
Oh, okay. Fourth word.

605
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,479
What the hell is he doing now?

606
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,252
I don't know what the hell that is.

607
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,952
<i>Seven Year Itch!</i>

608
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,357
<i>What is that?</i>

609
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,201
He's holding his hands out.

610
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,865
Chest! Chest!

611
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,431
<i>Mother Jugs and Speed!</i>

612
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,704
<i>It is not Mother Jugs and Speed!</i>

613
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,338
<i>God!</i>

614
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,508
Clayton, excuse me. How do you expect us to get the answer

615
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,949
with the quality of the clues you're giving us?

616
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,078
<i>I don't wanna be the one to say this,</i>

617
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,623
<i>but I don't think you're cut out for this game.</i>

618
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,955
<i>Don't be so hard on the man, Frank.</i>

619
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,995
Some people don't have the aptitude for this sort of thing.

620
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,031
This is ridiculous.

621
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,396
You sir, are an ass.

622
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,797
<i>Richard,</i>

623
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,327
I hope you will enjoy your real parents.

624
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,200
My dear.

625
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,842
Real nice party, Richard.

626
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,075
Who's turn is?

627
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,913
You're dumb as a shovel, ain't ya?

628
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:12,514
You know, Richard, things are rarely as bad as they seem,

629
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,558
which makes tonight to unique.

630
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,384
Good night.

631
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,758
Good night, Jeffrey.

632
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,855
<i>You gonna go? Bring the hat over here.</i>

633
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,628
<i>I'll do one. Leaving Las Vegas!</i>

634
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,566
Well guys, I guess this is it.

635
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,570
We really hate to leave.

636
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,309
<i>But I guess we'll see you at the wedding.</i>

637
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,282
Hey, you never told us the date.

638
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,547
Oh, didn't I? Well, it's all gonna be in the invitation.

639
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,678
Oh.

640
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,847
Oh, good, good.

641
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,517
<i>Son, I can't tell you how proud we are of you.</i>

642
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,760
We are so proud of you.

643
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,195
You are a fine, fine man.

644
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,963
And Ellen, we never had a daughter.

645
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,160
<i>But we feel like we got one now.</i>

646
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,866
Thank you. That's very sweet.

647
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,341
The traffic backs up right about now, so...

648
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,436
I can honestly say

649
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:13,610
that this has been the best two days of our lives.

650
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:17,051
<i>We may have only spent a weekend together,</i>

651
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,351
but we've loved a lifetime.

652
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,793
Yeah, it feels that way.

653
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:24,919
Oh.

654
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,295
Now you know you all can come and visit us.

655
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,166
<i>It's only a trailer, but we'll sleep on the sofa.</i>

656
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,297
That, uh, I, I don't think that's gonna be necessary.

657
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,365
Good bye, you all.

658
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,774
Okay, bye-bye.

659
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:43,336
<i>A tornado touched down just outside of Pekin, Illinois.</i>

660
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,382
<i>The worst to hit our area in many years.</i>

661
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,508
Did he say Pekin?

662
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,552
Uh, no, he didn't. Drive carefully.

663
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,282
<i>A tornado touched down just outside Pekin, Illinois.</i>

664
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,848
<i>It looks like the worst one to hit this area in years.</i>

665
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,656
<i>We are waiting for information...</i>

666
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:01,027
That's our park. That's where we live!

667
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,430
<i>There's our sofa.</i>

668
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,489
Where?

669
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,058
Up in that tree.

670
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,969
<i>Everything we own is in that trailer.</i>

671
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,998
<i>Everything in the world. Gone with the wind.</i>

672
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,773
Well, the Dan Ryan starts to lock up at about 5: 30, so...

673
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,781
Richard!

674
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,512
We have no home to go to, son. That's it.

675
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,020
This is awful. I hope you're insured.

676
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,556
Oh, no. I'm afraid not.

677
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,251
We ain't even got a bank account.

678
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,818
I don't believe in insurance. And I don't trust nobody with our money.

679
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:36,663
I kept it all in the home. Not to mention 50 cases of Scoot.

680
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:40,932
Oh, Lord. Why should this tragedy befall us?

681
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,836
<i>What's gonna become of us?</i>

682
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,137
<i>Is there anyone you can stay with?</i>

683
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:48,542
<i>I guess it's the streets for us. But we'll get by.</i>

684
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,310
We've been in tougher scrapes than this before, honey.

685
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:56,820
<i>I don't think I can go through being homeless again.</i>

686
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:00,824
<i>Not at my age.</i>

687
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,484
Richard.

688
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,493
Richard, can I speak to you for a moment?

689
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,653
Okay.

690
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,067
We've gotta do something.

691
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,901
Come on, Ellen. I did my part.

692
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,908
I did the weekend. I saw it through. I want my life back.

693
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,443
What are they supposed to do?

694
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,138
Why can't they live in their car?

695
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:25,080
They lived in a trailer home. That's like a big car.

696
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,413
I cannot believe you.

697
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,579
You are being completely heartless.

698
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,818
<i>You are always speaking out on the plight of those less fortunate.</i>

699
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,621
<i>Now you're ready to turn your own parents out on the street?</i>

700
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,561
I know they're a little obnoxious,

701
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,599
but they really do seem to care about you unconditionally,

702
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,261
which is a lot more that I can say for Doug and Arleen.

703
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,032
Doug and Arleen Clayton are good people.

704
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,097
They may be a tad conservative, but they're fine people.

705
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,109
Ellen, the weeding is in two weeks.

706
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,701
This is the worst time for this.

707
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:59,842
It'll only be a few days. The wedding is all set to go. Richard?

708
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,818
Richard, you know this is the right thing to do.

709
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,922
Right?

710
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,554
Uh, folks?

711
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,030
Richard has something he'd like to tell you.

712
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,333
Ellen and I want you to know that, um, you're welcome to stay here for a few days.

713
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,467
If that makes you uncomfortable, we completely understand.

714
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:30,344
What can I say, son?

715
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,144
You've rescued us in our hour of need.

716
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,582
I guess family is the most important bond of all.

717
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,919
Yeah.

718
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,519
Nothing on Earth is more important than family.

719
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,166
Oh, my.

720
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,307
I'm so full of emotion.

721
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,845
You're not uncomfortable with this at all, then?

722
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,073
No, this is so good.

723
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,549
I found these in the garage. They'll help you sleep.

724
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,454
No, I refuse to wear ear plugs in my own house.

725
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,551
I'll say one thing for them.

726
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,120
It's sweet to see a couple who are still so attracted to each other.

727
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,063
Sweet? That's psychotic.

728
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,695
They're completely oblivious to the effect they're having on others.

729
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:30,002
That's alright, because it's not getting under my skin.

730
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,066
My feet have been all itchy lately. Do you think it's Blackfoot?

731
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,441
You don't have Blackfoot.

732
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,413
How do you know? Are you a podiatrist?

733
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,507
Stop pacing and come back to bed. You're making me nervous.

734
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,710
Alright.

735
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,586
<i>Who's my Daddy?</i>

736
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,333
Do you mind?!

737
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,606
Dear.

738
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,679
<i>You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen before.</i>

739
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,882
Except a brain.

740
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,590
Hey, honey. Are you okay?

741
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,286
Yeah, yeah.

742
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,921
Do you think they're gonna start looking for a place?

743
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:30,626
Doc, could you at least try to like them, for me?

744
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,302
Of course. You... you know me. Uh, of course.

745
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,631
Do I look smaller to you?

746
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,068
If you get a chance,

747
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,546
remind her that there's no smoking in the house.

748
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,173
I'll tell her.

749
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,411
<i>Where are you running off to, son?</i>

750
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,680
<i>Uh, nowhere.</i>

751
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,450
Uh, I got some business in town.

752
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,753
Wanna toss the ball around a little?

753
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,221
Uh, no.

754
00:39:56,293 --> 00:40:00,457
I mean, I... I would love to, but I really... I'm, I'm running late.

755
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,465
Come on, son.

756
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,900
All my life I dreamed about tossing the pigskin

757
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,234
around on the lawn with my only son.

758
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,102
Huh.

759
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,109
I... I can't Frank. I really can't.

760
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:18,114
I... I've got a bad shoulder. You know, I dislocated it once playing Lacrosse.

761
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,777
That's no big deal. I got bad knees, a bad back.

762
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,752
I got a bad heart.

763
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,654
Come on, let's play a little catch while I'm still alive.

764
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,951
I'm in a really good suit.

765
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,927
Let me just toss it to you one time.

766
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:36,126
Okay, alright, one time. And then I really have to run. One time.

767
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,599
Get the camera.

768
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,159
<i>Woo-hoo. Here we go.</i>

769
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,138
Oh, this is a dream come true, son.

770
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,005
Oh, that's a very fine watch you got there.

771
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,441
You must be living right.

772
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,001
Thank you. It was a gift.

773
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,341
Yes, a fine watch.

774
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,279
If you ever need another one, let me know,

775
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,807
because I know a guy who sells 'em wholesale out of the back of his car.

776
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,080
Come on, let's go.

777
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:58,977
Here ya go.

778
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,057
Oh, you're looking good, son.

779
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,491
Okay.

780
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,051
Go long, son. Go long.

781
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,361
Oh, very good.

782
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,464
That was pretty good. Alright, here we go.

783
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:12,593
<i>Alright, son.</i>

784
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:15,170
Whoa. Very nice.

785
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,797
Do this with Doug?

786
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,171
No.

787
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,211
Doug didn't really like to get his hands dirty.

788
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,139
Well, stick with me, son. My hands is always dirty.

789
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,014
Hit me hard. Come on.

790
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,780
Come on, let's go. Right here.

791
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,788
Ah!

792
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:35,519
Oh, what happened? Son, son!

793
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,356
I think I dislocated my shoulder.

794
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,487
Oh, hold still. I'll pop it back in for ya.

795
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,690
No, no, no. You're not gonna pop anything.

796
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,357
Trust me. I can do this.

797
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,902
<i>I've seen Lethal Weapon ten times. Give me that.</i>

798
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,939
Let him pop it. He's good at popping it in.

799
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,268
I can do it.

800
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,104
No popping.

801
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,571
Almost got him that time. Here we go.

802
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,170
Come on, I'm gonna get you.

803
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,375
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

804
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,480
<i>Stay away from me.</i>

805
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,785
Do I have more hair in this picture?

806
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,382
What?

807
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,449
Never mind.

808
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,688
Hi.

809
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,923
I just wanna thank you, Dr. Clayton.

810
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:17,729
This book really saved my life. Could you sign it?

811
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,564
I'd be honored.

812
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,810
There you are.

813
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,317
I can't read this.

814
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,656
Thank you.

815
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,854
Richard, are you sure you're gonna be able to do this?

816
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,760
Yeah, yeah.

817
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,297
That's my boy.

818
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,002
Oh, they're done early.

819
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,941
<i>Since when do you read The Star?</i>

820
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,042
Oh, it's Agnes'. It's very interesting.

821
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,019
Don't they have somewhere to go, yet?

822
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,181
I'll gladly pay for a hotel.

823
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,953
They won't take any money from us. They're very proud.

824
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:20,122
Proud? Proud of 200 years of inbreeding?

825
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,791
They broke my arm. My book signing was a disaster.

826
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,767
They're actually not that bad once you get to know them.

827
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,828
In fact, Frank is very handy around the house.

828
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,397
Agnes gave me wonderful recipes.

829
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:36,469
Recipes for what? Pig's feet or possum pie?

830
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,082
Mmm.

831
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,782
Ellen, this is delicious. What is it?

832
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,257
Tempeh croquette with a tofu tahini dip.

833
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,696
Do I have the best wife in the world or what?

834
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,926
And that's not all. I have a special surprise for you.

835
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,903
<i>A surprise? I love surprises.</i>

836
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,273
It's a cheese ball.

837
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,007
I made it myself with my own two feet.

838
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,817
What the hell?

839
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,956
No. No!

840
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,392
Your father said you're looking for a rug.

841
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:26,690
I cut you a deal.

842
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,692
<i>No. No, this isn't happening.</i>

843
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,464
<i>Just shut the hell up. Just shut the hell up!</i>

844
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:34,970
You're not my wife.

845
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,031
Yes, I am. And you're my husband.

846
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,666
Lookee here.

847
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,085
Like father, like son!

848
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,790
<i>No. No!</i>

849
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,162
No!

850
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,495
What's the matter? Ain't ya hungry?

851
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,571
Run, honey, run.

852
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,105
Ah.

853
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,578
Oh.

854
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,542
Oh, Ellen.

855
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,549
I just had the worst dream.

856
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,853
Son?

857
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,024
Agnes?

858
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,567
Are you okay?

859
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,733
I thought I heard a scream.

860
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,203
Yeah, I... I just... I had a nightmare.

861
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,172
<i>But I'm fine. Thank you.</i>

862
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,439
<i>Oh, honey. Don't cry. Mommy's here.</i>

863
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,241
Okay.

864
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,407
You know,

865
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:57,045
there was a lullaby I used to sing to you when you were a little baby.

866
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,648
I bet if I sang it to you now, you'd drop right off to sleep.

867
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,160
Tha... That's not necessary. I... I don't, I don't...

868
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,035
That... that's very pretty, but I don't wanna wake Ellen up.

869
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,612
Agnes, I'm 34 years old.

870
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:32,678
<i>Very restful. Thank you, Agnes.</i>

871
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,358
There's another verse?

872
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,531
Point it toward me. Wait, wait. That angle.

873
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,761
There we go. Right there? You happy?

874
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,463
Ellen, have you seen my watch?

875
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,630
What watch?

876
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:52,038
Mi Rolex. I can't find it. It's just gone.

877
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:53,736
When was the last time you had it?

878
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,244
Last night. I took it off.

879
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,076
I put it on the nightstand like I always do.

880
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,979
You know what? Frank was commenting on it yesterday.

881
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,145
Remember that? He was admiring it.

882
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,280
Oh, Richard, you can't be serious.

883
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,085
He stole my watch!

884
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,320
<i>Do you honestly think</i>

885
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,694
<i>that Frank snuck in here in the middle of the night and took your watch?</i>

886
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,667
I don't know! He does have a criminal record.

887
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:22,364
You have to ask yourself what kind of man impersonates a meat inspector.

888
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:25,465
I never met a sane person in your family.

889
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,339
<i>You probably misplaced it.</i>

890
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:30,744
Oh, no, I didn't. I didn't misplace it, Ellen.

891
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:33,214
My father gave me that watch. My real father.

892
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,843
You always told me you thought it was too flashy.

893
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,444
That doesn't mean it gives him the right to steal it.

894
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,788
<i>Bye, honey.</i>

895
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,157
<i>Be safe.</i>

896
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,059
I will. Thank you.

897
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,379
Is this the Clayton residence?

898
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,540
<i>Yes, it is. But there must be some mistake.</i>

899
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,174
We didn't order any meat.

900
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,582
Well, someone did.

901
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:14,249
Got an order here for a Franklin... Manurie? Manrouee?

902
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,258
Woo-hoo! Ho!

903
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,352
My prime rib's here. Finally.

904
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,418
Prime rib?

905
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,727
Yeah, from the Meat- of-the-Month Club.

906
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:25,791
I've been waiting three weeks for this. Come on, boy.

907
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,200
Right in the kitchen.

908
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:31,332
I had to move out all that Satan stuff and make some room for it.

909
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,674
<i>That's right.</i>

910
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,873
Ready, set, let go.

911
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,807
Yeah, stick it... wait. Move that tofu.

912
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:45,719
Um, Frank, you haven't seen my Rolex by any chance, have you?

913
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,347
No, I didn't, son.

914
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,049
That's good. Let me sign it for you.

915
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,960
<i>You don't have another, like you have a list of meat?</i>

916
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,295
I'm gonna be downstairs working on my new book, downstairs in the office.

917
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:59,301
Fine. I'll catch you next time.

918
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,103
Woo. It's hot as a pistol out there.

919
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,837
I'm sweating like a whore in church. You ain't lyin'.

920
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:46,645
You know, all that suntan lotion and naked flesh gives a man some ideas.

921
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:50,312
Oh, yeah? What are you gettin' at, Franklin Menure?

922
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,446
I'm gonna be getting at you in a minute.

923
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:57,389
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

924
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,861
<i>You're my honey.</i>

925
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,064
<i>Son! Son, are you alright?</i>

926
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,233
If you had any questions about sex, why didn't you just ask?

927
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,799
I don't wanna talk about it.

928
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:14,969
You're still our son.

929
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,535
I don't wanna talk about it!

930
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:17,739
We understand.

931
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,009
We're here for you, Junior. Son!

932
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,778
Son, son!

933
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:26,118
Your mom and I are very concerned about you. You're the pent-up type.

934
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,487
You've got to get in touch with your emotions.

935
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:29,786
Go away!

936
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,243
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

937
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,439
It's not gonna work.

938
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:54,973
<i>Of course it's gonna work. Look how it flatters your waistline.</i>

939
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,917
Mom, I'm not talking about the dress.

940
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,750
What's the matter?

941
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,786
I've been reevaluating things lately.

942
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,691
That's only natural, honey.

943
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,161
This is a very big step for the two of you.

944
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,964
I'm just not sure if Richard and I are right for each other.

945
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:17,473
Mom, he always seemed so tolerant and so compassionate.

946
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,099
What do you mean, seemed?

947
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:22,441
I just don't understand why he is so hard on Frank and Agnes.

948
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:23,672
I know they're coarse

949
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,307
and they can come across a little too strong some times

950
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:30,149
but, I don't know, it seems like he wrote them off from Day One.

951
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,315
Well, he really seems to love you.

952
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,221
I know he does.

953
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:39,752
When you love somebody, you gotta accept them for who they are.

954
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:51,197
I'll get it.

955
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,468
I'll get it.

956
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,204
<i>No, I'll get it.</i>

957
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:57,570
Hello?

958
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,547
Hey, are you sitting down?

959
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,605
No. Why?

960
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,142
The Holly Davis show called. They want you on the show, Friday.

961
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,950
Holly Davis, this Friday?

962
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:09,958
<i>Yes! Deepak Chopra canceled. He got appendicitis.</i>

963
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,254
That's fantastic.

964
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,627
I know! Richard, this is the break of a lifetime.

965
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:18,134
One appearance on that show could really put your book over the top.

966
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:20,226
<i>I'll call you tomorrow with the details.</i>

967
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,294
Perfect. I'll speak to you then.

968
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,805
Honey, that's terrific.

969
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,502
Just wait till I tell my parents.

970
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,908
No need, son. We heard every word.

971
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,544
Just a last-minute-thing fell into my lap

972
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,847
but it looks like it could be a very big break.

973
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,683
Congratulations, Richard. That sounds very exciting.

974
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,552
<i>I'm sure you'll be a big hit</i>

975
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:44,025
with dissatisfied overweight housewives everywhere.

976
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,528
It seems a bit long in the sleeves, doesn't it?

977
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,662
Mom, really?

978
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:52,395
<i>Richard, your father and I have been discussing this</i>

979
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:56,371
and we both feel very strongly that these Menures have got to go.

980
00:52:56,439 --> 00:53:00,273
If you insist on continuing your association with these horrible people,

981
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,743
<i>your mother and I will not be at the wedding.</i>

982
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,507
<i>There's only room enough</i>

983
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,515
<i>for one set of parents in this family.</i>

984
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,051
Either us or them. The choice is yours.

985
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:14,651
Well, I, I assure you they'll be out by the wedding, Mother.

986
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,192
Come on! They're fun!

987
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,786
<i>Excuse me. Hi.</i>

988
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,086
Get out of here.

989
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,654
Ouch!

990
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,307
Yeah.

991
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,243
Oh, son.

992
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:49,445
Everybody, we'd like to introduce our son, Frank Jr.

993
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,623
Hey, Frank, I want to...

994
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,023
These are all of my friends from the Peekaboo Carnival.

995
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,789
Son, these people just been passing through and, uh,

996
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:01,797
how about you sit down and relax with us?

997
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,264
No, thanks.

998
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:07,235
I would like to have a word with my fiancée. In private.

999
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,883
Excuse me.

1000
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,544
Hey, I'm 85 years old.

1001
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,053
Congratulations.

1002
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:29,987
I want them out now.

1003
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,858
Oh, Richard, let's not go through this again.

1004
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:37,025
They've overstayed their welcome, and I want them out now.

1005
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,536
You had no right to let them throw a party without consulting with me first.

1006
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:43,401
They said they were going to invite a few friends over.

1007
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,805
I had no idea it was gonna be this elaborate.

1008
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,673
<i>The entire cast of Hee Haw is down there.</i>

1009
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,838
They haven't seen their friends in a long time.

1010
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:54,145
Can we give them this little pleasure? They will wrap it up by 10:00.

1011
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,684
Ten? Ellen,

1012
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:59,051
I have a live national television appearance tomorrow morning.

1013
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,680
I'll ask them to cut it short.

1014
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:05,558
No! I've had it, and I want them out now! These people are a plague.

1015
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,493
Why do you hate them so much?

1016
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,623
Why? Why? I'll tell you why.

1017
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,031
<i>Because they're rude, crude, and intrusive.</i>

1018
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,866
They're the most dysfunctional people I've ever met.

1019
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,099
They're a biological and sociological mess.

1020
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,232
That's who they are. You can't stand the thought

1021
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:22,369
that you might be the offspring of such common people.

1022
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,434
That's not true.

1023
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,505
You know what you are, Richard? You're a snob.

1024
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,107
Are you calling me a snob?

1025
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,379
That's right. I'm calling you a snob.

1026
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:32,045
I am not a snob.

1027
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,613
Yes, you are. You're a total snob!

1028
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:37,125
Why don't you just shut up?

1029
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,188
You shut up!

1030
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:40,524
No, you shut up!

1031
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:41,962
Son, son.

1032
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,659
<i>It may not be my place to say,</i>

1033
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,328
but you shouldn't be talking to your wife like that.

1034
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,804
<i>A man's wife should be treated with respect.</i>

1035
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:50,897
A man's wife...

1036
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,168
You shut up, you cow.

1037
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,143
I'm trying to tell him that a man's wife is his castle.

1038
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:56,473
<i>His castle?</i>

1039
00:56:56,546 --> 00:57:00,141
<i>If your brains was chocolate, you wouldn't have enough to fill an M&M.</i>

1040
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:03,549
I'm trying to talk some sense, and you're mixing your metaphors.

1041
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,882
<i>I'm trying to help.</i>

1042
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,649
You can help by shuttin' up.

1043
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:07,985
Get out of my house!

1044
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:11,823
Get out of here right now! All of you! Party's over!

1045
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:15,695
That's right! Not one more minute! Not one more minute!

1046
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,529
<i>Out! The party's over. Everyone out!</i>

1047
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,128
Go on! What are you, anyway?

1048
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,638
Where do you think you're going?

1049
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,537
<i>I am going to my mother's.</i>

1050
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,405
For although she may not be perfect,

1051
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,741
I accept her for who she is!

1052
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,610
Come back here.

1053
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,740
Come back here right this second!

1054
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,451
Not you!

1055
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,611
Ellen?

1056
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,351
Shut up, Susie.

1057
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,404
Welcome back.

1058
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,935
If you just joined us, our guest today is Dr. Richard Clayton,

1059
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:08,279
<i>the author of a new self-help book titled Ready, Set, Let go.</i>

1060
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,581
<i>A Guide to Anger Management.</i>

1061
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,914
<i>Ready, Set, Let Go</i>

1062
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,982
seems kind of simplistic, doesn't it?

1063
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,190
Holly, I can personally vouch for this program because it certainly changed my life.

1064
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,893
Tell me what was your life like before you developed your system.

1065
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:28,233
<i>Well, I had a very, very difficult childhood</i>

1066
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:31,330
<i>which led to some quite destructive tendencies as an adult.</i>

1067
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:32,874
<i>I was prone to fits of rage.</i>

1068
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,842
<i>Things finally came to a head</i>

1069
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:38,210
<i>when I had a nervous breakdown at the age of 29.</i>

1070
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:43,776
And after being arrested for disorderly conduct after some drunken binges,

1071
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,980
I realized that it was time for a change.

1072
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:49,582
Uh, I stopped drinking and eventually completed my doctorate.

1073
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,524
That's amazing.

1074
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:55,621
Is it true you haven't lost your temper in four years?

1075
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,496
<i>Uh... yeah. Actu... you could say that, that, that...</i>

1076
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,663
<i>that since I developed these techniques,</i>

1077
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:06,539
<i>I, I've definitely, uh, managed my emotions much better.</i>

1078
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,544
Richard, we have a little surprise for you.

1079
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,170
<i>A surprise?</i>

1080
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,875
<i>We know you've come a long way.</i>

1081
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,282
<i>Your family must be very proud.</i>

1082
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,116
<i>So we brought your parents here today</i>

1083
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:22,624
<i>to talk about the past and how far you've come.</i>

1084
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,884
I beg your pardon?

1085
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:28,897
In fact, they're here at the studio audience right now.

1086
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,990
Shall we bring them down?

1087
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,264
<i>Yeah, let's bring them out. Come on out, folks.</i>

1088
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,396
<i>Please, welcome Richard's parents.</i>

1089
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,702
<i>How ya doin'? Hello.</i>

1090
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,711
How the hell are ya?

1091
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,839
How the hell are ya?

1092
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,143
Good morning, America.

1093
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,184
<i>Wrong show, dingaling.</i>

1094
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,241
<i>Shut the hell up.</i>

1095
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,483
<i>Welcome to the show. Hello.</i>

1096
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,824
<i>Pleased to know ya.</i>

1097
00:59:56,893 --> 01:00:00,090
<i>I'm Frank Menure. This is my wife Agnes and there's our boy.</i>

1098
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,858
<i>It's him right there. Frank Jr.</i>

1099
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,797
<i>There's, there's been a terrible mistake.</i>

1100
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,268
<i>These are not my parents.</i>

1101
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:09,737
<i>These aren't your parents?</i>

1102
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,435
<i>Of course we're his parents. I don't look old enough.</i>

1103
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:17,411
A friend of mine recently told me I have the skin of a 20-year-old.

1104
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,506
That friend mention anything about your 50-year-old ass?

1105
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,685
No, your name didn't come up.

1106
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,285
<i>Holly, we are so proud of our boy.</i>

1107
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,294
<i>He is a chip off the ol' block.</i>

1108
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:35,889
As my daddy used to say, blood is thicker than water.

1109
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,661
<i>Not with all the alcohol in yours.</i>

1110
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:43,468
He tried a 12-step program, but he got so drunk he fell down the steps.

1111
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,674
You'll have to pardon my wife.

1112
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,974
She's got a mouth like a damn Seven-Eleven.

1113
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,037
It's open 24 hours a day.

1114
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,675
I'm sorry. I have to set something straight.

1115
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:58,016
These people, you're not my parents.

1116
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,453
<i>My parents are Doug and Arleen Clayton.</i>

1117
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:02,753
<i>I... I don't understand.</i>

1118
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:06,283
<i>These people, they're... They've contributed biologically,</i>

1119
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,557
so they're biological contributers. Yes.

1120
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:12,931
Technically, they're parents of mine, but they're not my parents.

1121
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,199
<i>My staff was informed that these are your parents.</i>

1122
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,103
<i>Informed? Informed by whom?</i>

1123
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,108
<i>Your brother Mitch, I believe.</i>

1124
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,542
<i>At least I think he was your brother.</i>

1125
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,313
<i>Holly, you gonna have to excuse our boy.</i>

1126
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:28,850
<i>He's not himself today.</i>

1127
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:31,887
<i>On account of the trouble he's been having at home.</i>

1128
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,013
I can't watch.

1129
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,923
He's just been having some trouble with the little lady.

1130
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,120
<i>They're fixing on tying the knot.</i>

1131
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:42,596
<i>And they had themselves a little misunderstanding.</i>

1132
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:45,156
He was like a man possessed.

1133
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:48,533
<i>He and his gal, but they love each other.</i>

1134
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,903
<i>I'm sure he didn't mean to scream at her like he did.</i>

1135
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:52,838
<i>You know kids.</i>

1136
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,878
He's a good boy. We're so proud of him.

1137
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,378
We are so proud of him.

1138
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:02,880
Oh, my God! Frank!

1139
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,857
<i>Leave him alone.</i>

1140
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,655
<i>Don't hurt the boy.</i>

1141
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,990
<i>Don't hurt him.</i>

1142
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,907
<i>Hey, Jennifer. Hey, what about tonight?</i>

1143
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,811
<i>What do you mean you got homework?</i>

1144
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,316
<i>You know, I never did homework.</i>

1145
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,147
Come here, you son of a bitch!

1146
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,245
I'll kill ya!

1147
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,447
I'll kill ya.

1148
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,254
It was a joke. I never meant for it to go this far.

1149
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:46,227
<i>I'll kill you.</i>

1150
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,660
Don't. It's an Italian sweater.

1151
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:55,601
Don't pull on it!

1152
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,334
Go ahead. Go ahead, hit me.

1153
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,035
I've always been jealous of you.

1154
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,010
You've done so much with your life.

1155
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:04,637
I've done nothing. I...

1156
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:08,244
I guess that's why I've always been such a prick to you.

1157
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,520
Swish. Two points.

1158
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:20,623
Wow.

1159
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,164
<i>There was chaos on the set</i>

1160
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:24,927
<i>as one of the guests went berserk.</i>

1161
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:28,027
<i>Dr. Richard Clayton, author of a book on anger management,</i>

1162
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,699
<i>blew his top today during a taping of the popular TV talk show</i>

1163
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:36,575
<i>attacking his own parents on camera before a live audience.</i>

1164
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:41,276
<i>I guess he should have called his book Ready, Set, Go Nuts!</i>

1165
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,210
<i>And now back to Mother, Jugs and Speed.</i>

1166
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:52,694
<i>There's good news and there's bad news.</i>

1167
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:56,323
The bad news is your publisher called. They wanna drop you.

1168
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,163
The book tour has been canceled.

1169
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:01,635
And Kmart has decided to stop carrying the book.

1170
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,567
And the good news?

1171
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,739
You've been invited to be on Jerry Springer.

1172
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,680
I'm really at my wit's end, Dad.

1173
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:15,979
Ellen's gone back to her mother and...

1174
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:19,351
<i>I'd like to come back and stay for a couple of days if I could,</i>

1175
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,980
just to get my head straight.

1176
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:25,187
Richard, this is really not a good time. We have guests.

1177
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,363
<i>This is your mess, son.</i>

1178
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,832
You're going to have to deal with it yourself.

1179
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:44,111
<i>Agnes, you really don't have to do that.</i>

1180
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,343
It's the least we could do, you lettin' us stay here and all.

1181
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,974
You mean it's the least I can do.

1182
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,884
All you've done is sit there on your tail.

1183
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,285
Shut your hole.

1184
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,720
There's still no answer.

1185
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,928
We just feel terrible about this.

1186
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:05,024
Mitch told us it was gonna help his career. Oh, sugar.

1187
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:09,467
Is one little argument worth throwing a whole wedding over for?

1188
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:15,534
<i>I just can't see myself spending the rest of my life with him anymore.</i>

1189
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,171
I feel like he's not the man I thought he was.

1190
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:22,547
Maybe you oughta go there and see if he's okay. He won't talk to us.

1191
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,518
Oh, honey.

1192
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,257
Richard?

1193
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,015
Richard?

1194
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:09,229
Are you down here?

1195
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:15,367
Oh, hi, Ellen. I didn't, uh,

1196
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,867
I didn't hear you come in.

1197
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,067
Uh, maybe you can give me a hand.

1198
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,939
I'm making a cheese ball.

1199
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,481
It's a lot harder than it looks.

1200
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,351
<i>I tried to call you but you were...</i>

1201
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,387
Richard, is that meat?

1202
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,481
Mmm.

1203
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,322
<i>Barbecued pork. It's the meat of the month.</i>

1204
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,557
<i>A little red meat's not so bad from time to time.</i>

1205
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,066
Honey, what are you doing to yourself?

1206
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,762
I'm accepting my heritage, Ellen.

1207
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,605
You know, I've had this thing all wrong from the beginning.

1208
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,270
Why fight it? I'm a Menure.

1209
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:59,403
Okay, you know what...

1210
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:03,819
What difference does it make? I'm ruined anyway.

1211
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:06,354
This is not the man I know.

1212
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,152
No, you knew Richard Clayton.

1213
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:12,353
I'm Frank Menure Jr. How the hell are ya?

1214
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,092
Richard, this is crazy!

1215
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,725
Well, runs in the family.

1216
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:22,532
What about our plans? We're supposed to get married. We're supposed to...

1217
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,004
And do what?

1218
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,234
<i>Bring more Menures in the world?</i>

1219
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,209
More Cokie Syndrome? More Blackfoot?

1220
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,714
No, thank you very much. These genes stop here.

1221
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:39,653
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a cheese ball to make.

1222
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,086
Fine, if that's the way you feel about it,

1223
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,591
then you should have this back.

1224
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:58,231
Good bye.

1225
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,103
That's alright, Ellen.

1226
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,408
I'll be fine.

1227
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,408
I'm in complete control of my emotions.

1228
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,082
Ready, set,

1229
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:25,992
<i>Mom, he's so far gone. I don't know what to do.</i>

1230
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:27,535
What happened?

1231
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:31,164
He's a drunken wreck.

1232
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,869
It's like he's totally given up. He's even eating meat.

1233
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,940
Richard's eating meat?

1234
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,445
Yes, red meat.

1235
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:39,947
<i>Well, he's not himself.</i>

1236
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,779
<i>It's the fear of commitment. It's the pressure...</i>

1237
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:45,320
<i>No, no, no, no, it's not. It's the Menures.</i>

1238
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:50,017
<i>He, he, he blames them for everything.</i>

1239
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:53,061
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

1240
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,994
<i>It's alright.</i>

1241
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:58,966
<i>It's alright now. It's alright.</i>

1242
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,681
Go away!

1243
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,328
<i>Get off my property.</i>

1244
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:30,695
We just come to get our things, son. We won't be a minute.

1245
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:33,166
Good news. We're leaving.

1246
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:36,363
The Peekaboo Carnival has offered us our old jobs back.

1247
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:40,139
Alright. Stay there. I'll get it.

1248
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,742
There's your stuff. Now just go away.

1249
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,084
You didn't happen to see my silver locket lying around, did you?

1250
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,453
It's shaped like a heart.

1251
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:58,084
No. Good bye.

1252
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,650
Wait just a second, son.

1253
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:00,956
What do you want?

1254
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:04,295
Uh, we would like to speak to you for a minute if we could.

1255
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,598
Just one more time, then we'd be out of your hair for good.

1256
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:12,334
<i>I think what we have to say you'll be very interested in.</i>

1257
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:17,973
I don't quite know how to say this. Um...

1258
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,547
Might as well just tell him.

1259
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,846
Would you please just get to the point?

1260
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,285
We're not really your parents, son.

1261
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:29,819
You...

1262
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,086
What?

1263
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:39,692
See, we always wanted kids, but we never could have any of our own.

1264
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:44,068
And then we saw that ad in the paper and we figured, well, let's give it a shot.

1265
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:46,965
No, you can't be serious.

1266
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:50,978
<i>We had to do some fancy talking around that detective.</i>

1267
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:54,106
<i>But we're smarter than we look.</i>

1268
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,378
We never meant no harm.

1269
01:10:56,452 --> 01:11:00,650
So you mean to tell me that this past week,

1270
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,658
this entire ordeal, was all based on a lie?

1271
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,422
We realize now it was wrong.

1272
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,328
And we're, we're very sorry.

1273
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,492
<i>Sorry? You're sorry?</i>

1274
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,093
You ruined my life!

1275
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,397
<i>I could have you arrested for this!</i>

1276
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:19,498
I told you.

1277
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,543
Well, son, that's your choice.

1278
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:25,740
<i>But, uh, then we would have to stick around for the trial and all.</i>

1279
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:30,217
<i>Uh, otherwise, we just get out of your hair.</i>

1280
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,881
No, perhaps you're right, Mr. Menure. If that is your real name,

1281
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,823
which I hope for your sake to God that it is not.

1282
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:43,024
<i>When I think of poor, sweet, trusting Ellen defending the two of you.</i>

1283
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,464
Wait until I tell her about this.

1284
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:48,230
You are the lowest people that I have ever met.

1285
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,671
If I see you around here again, I will call the police.

1286
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,140
Good bye and good riddance!

1287
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:05,453
<i>I can't believe they would do something like that.</i>

1288
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:10,220
<i>They seemed so genuine. They seemed like they really cared about you.</i>

1289
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,295
Can we talk in private just for a second?

1290
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,025
I was headed upstairs.

1291
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,934
Mom, we'll be down in a minute!

1292
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,631
Well, I guess they fooled both of us, huh?

1293
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,635
This doesn't change the way that you treated them, Richard.

1294
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:33,682
You didn't even know they weren't your parents at the time.

1295
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:38,384
You really betrayed the values I thought we shared.

1296
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:41,480
You're right. Ellen, I'm ashamed of the way that I acted.

1297
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:44,890
Most of all, I'm ashamed of they way that I acted towards you.

1298
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,123
<i>I just... I couldn't accept the fact that I could...</i>

1299
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:51,526
That I could've come from people like that.

1300
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,761
<i>And I paid a huge price for it.</i>

1301
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,930
Not my career. I got what I deserved there.

1302
01:12:57,005 --> 01:13:00,668
Ellen, I don't wanna lose you over this.

1303
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,473
<i>You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.</i>

1304
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,890
What happened to your watch?

1305
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:26,759
I... I stopped wearing it. It's too flashy. It's really not me.

1306
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,566
Doc.

1307
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,267
Yeah, bunny?

1308
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,152
<i>The rehearsal went great.</i>

1309
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,851
It's going to be a lovely wedding.

1310
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:59,951
Thank Heaven those horrible people are finally gone.

1311
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:03,623
<i>You should be so glad those people aren't your real parents.</i>

1312
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:08,068
<i>Can you imagine being stuck with people like that the rest of your life?</i>

1313
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,000
<i>They're just lucky you didn't have them arrested.</i>

1314
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:20,845
To the Menures, who could not be with us tonight, I can only say, thanks.

1315
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,750
<i>Cheers.</i>

1316
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:28,585
<i>I hear this caterer we're using is wonderful.</i>

1317
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:32,787
<i>The Coolidges used them for their daughter's wedding.</i>

1318
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,058
Good night

1319
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:38,564
Good night, Richard.

1320
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,102
You okay, Doc? You seem like you have something on your mind.

1321
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,144
You're not having second thoughts, are you?

1322
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,844
No! Absolutely not.

1323
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,147
I'll see you tomorrow.

1324
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,348
Yeah.

1325
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:06,758
<i>Be safe.</i>

1326
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,401
Ivesdale.

1327
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:31,943
<i>Step right up.</i>

1328
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,278
<i>Step right up. Step right up.</i>

1329
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:40,117
Win yourself a prize. Knock over the milk cans and win yourself a big prize.

1330
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:42,486
You, son, you look like you could throw a ball.

1331
01:17:42,557 --> 01:17:45,287
How about winning a prize for the pretty young lady?

1332
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,622
Got a lot of nice prizes.

1333
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,686
Alright. Three balls for $5.

1334
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:51,130
Thank you. There you go. Lay into it, son.

1335
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:57,062
Oh! Almost, almost.

1336
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,004
Little over to the left here.

1337
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:01,837
<i>Oh, no. Here ya go.</i>

1338
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:03,901
You gotta real lay your arm into it.

1339
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:06,345
Yeah, you're ain't trying hard enough.

1340
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:10,309
<i>Oh, too bad.</i>

1341
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:11,909
This is a rip-off!

1342
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,249
You wanna try again?

1343
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,619
I bet I can knock you over easy enough.

1344
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:19,058
Well, son, since you're being such a good sport,

1345
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:21,561
<i>why don't we give you a consolation prize?</i>

1346
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:26,431
<i>Honey, dear, dear. Give him one of the consolation prizes.</i>

1347
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:31,131
A nice, a nice doggie for the young lady in pink. Yes, sir.

1348
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:35,040
Here you go. Pretty pink like your cotton candy.

1349
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,204
Thank you. Okay, mingle up. Thank you very much.

1350
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,908
Oh!

1351
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,849
Real smart, pop tart. The first day back to work

1352
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,046
and you're already blowing the profits.

1353
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:50,217
You could save me some money on a costume by working at the House of Horrors.

1354
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,728
You wanna see some horrors, monkey butt? I'll show you some horrors.

1355
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:55,820
<i>Monkey butt? Shut up.</i>

1356
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:56,955
<i>You better shut up.</i>

1357
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,624
I'd like to play.

1358
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,907
Actually, I...

1359
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,709
I just wanted to give you your locket back.

1360
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:13,980
Mom.

1361
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,544
Why did you lie to me?

1362
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:26,060
You said that your problems started when we showed up,

1363
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:29,495
so we just figured the best thing to do was to go away.

1364
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:36,836
So you gave me up for my own good... again.

1365
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:46,544
Can you ever forgive me?

1366
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,613
Of course. You're our son!

1367
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:51,242
<i>Baby boy.</i>

1368
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,918
Son, boy.

1369
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,795
Hey, uh, do you still wanna come to my wedding?

1370
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:06,196
Oh, nothing will give us more pleasure.

1371
01:20:06,268 --> 01:20:08,031
Hey, when is that wedding, anyway?

1372
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,765
Uh, it's jus... about an hour and a half.

1373
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,133
Where is he?

1374
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,405
He should've been here an hour ago.

1375
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,979
I wouldn't worry about him. He'll show up.

1376
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,783
Hello.

1377
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,282
<i>Whoa. There we go.</i>

1378
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:32,724
<i>That's a good spot.</i>

1379
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,153
Don't be nervous son.

1380
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,663
<i>You look so handsome.</i>

1381
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:39,291
I can't believe I'm actually doing this.

1382
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:43,770
All I can say, son, is that if Ellen makes you half as happy

1383
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,468
as Agnes has made me throughout the years,

1384
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:50,170
then you'll only be half as miserable as I am now.

1385
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:53,544
<i>Don't make me whip your butt in front of a church.</i>

1386
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:55,810
I better get in there. Wish me luck.

1387
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:57,078
Good luck, son.

1388
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,676
Oh, you're gonna be fine.

1389
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,616
<i>Don't forget to say "I do."</i>

1390
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,624
Alright. I'll see you in there.

1391
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,357
Kids.

1392
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,728
They grow up so fast.

1393
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,221
Just one second.

1394
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:08,389
Hi. Hello, everybody. Thank you for coming.

1395
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:13,325
Weddings are a time when we come together to celebrate new family.

1396
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,329
As many of you know,

1397
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,957
I've recently had some additions to my own family.

1398
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:22,362
<i>I'm very proud to introduce to you two special guests of mine</i>

1399
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,132
who don't appear in your program.

1400
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:28,301
My birth parents, Frank and Agnes Menure. Please welcome them.

1401
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:39,642
Okay.

1402
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,218
You look so pretty.

1403
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:20,819
Thank you.

1404
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,632
I'll explain later.

1405
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,100
Dearly beloved,

1406
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:41,137
we are gathered here together to unite this man and this woman

1407
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:43,377
<i>in holy matrimony.</i>

1408
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:46,113
<i>Marriage is a sacred state.</i>

1409
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:01,594
<i>Alright. Is it, is it on?</i>

1410
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:05,002
<i>If the red's light on, it means the camera's runnin'.</i>

1411
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,132
<i>What's this? Oh.</i>

1412
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:12,612
<i>Here we are at the maternity ward.</i>

1413
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,672
Oh, my God, please. What are you doing?

1414
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:18,776
Oh. No, no.

1415
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:21,014
<i>What d'you got hanging in there?</i>

1416
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,750
<i>What is that hanging down there?</i>

1417
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:24,587
Oh, stop that.

1418
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,127
<i>Come on. Oh, here we go.</i>

1419
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:32,394
I am just so happy

1420
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:35,630
and so excited about Richard and my daughter.

1421
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:37,034
Watch it, Spielberg.

1422
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:40,097
<i>And now, for the horror portion of our program.</i>

1423
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,439
Watch what you're doing with that camera

1424
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:45,809
or you're gonna find some extra footage where the sun don't shine.

1425
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,644
So, anybody wanna come in and say hello?

1426
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:50,377
<i>Yeah!</i>

1427
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,781
Hey, everybody.

1428
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,487
Would you like to meet little baby?

1429
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:03,721
<i>Let me take the camera.</i>

1430
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:11,535
<i>So, Angela, how do you feel about being a grandmother?</i>

1431
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,670
He looks like a Harvard man.

1432
01:25:19,747 --> 01:25:20,736
Oh no, Yale.

1433
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:24,008
<i>Clayton, pass him by. Give him to me.</i>

1434
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:25,313
<i>Be careful.</i>

1435
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:27,616
I know. You gotta hold his head.

1436
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:28,678
Oh, my God.

1437
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:30,451
<i>He looks just like you.</i>

1438
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:31,651
Don't he look like me?

1439
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:34,320
All wrinkled and short with his mouth wide open.

1440
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,287
Don't mind her.

1441
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:39,026
She's the first one in her family born in captivity.

1442
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,701
There you go. Oh, my goodness.

1443
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:44,795
Oh, oh.

1444
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:48,102
Oh, oh!

1445
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:51,703
<i>There ya go, Papa. Alright, Papa, okay.</i>

1446
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:04,222
<i>Oh yeah, he's a Menure all right.</i>

1447
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,858
Da-da.

1448
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:35,368
Daddy.

1449
01:29:36,305 --> 01:29:42,223
