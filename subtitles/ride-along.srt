I got water, but you panicked.

456
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,359
I don't even want
to dig into that.

457
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,199
That's getting off subject.
I want to talk to you...

458
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,389
Show and prove.

459
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,959
Show and what? What are you...

460
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,239
You want to marry my sister?

461
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,110
Show me you're worthy of her.

462
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,821
And prove to me you
got what it takes.

463
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,639
How do you want me to
do that? I don't get it.

464
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,079
Tomorrow, I'm going to
take you on a ride-along.

465
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,781
You can show me what kind
of man you're made of.

466
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,599
And prove to me

467
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,495
that you deserve somebody
as special as Angela.

468

- Mmm-hmm.

469
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,950
Thank you, man.

470
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,504
I cannot wait to show you that I'm
twice the man that you think I am.

471

I'll pick you up tomorrow.

All right. I'll see you then.

It's time to let go.

Hey, this is going to be great.

Didn't I tell you to
bar that patio door?

What are you doing, man?
It's 6:00 in the morning.

Uh-uh. Forgetting what?

492

This could be the last time Angela
sees your little ass alive.

493

Don't you want to say goodbye?

No.

495
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,506
You can get shot today.

Aw.

And I love the way your hands open
up and close, like monkey paws.

You was like, "Put it on your

- Hey, Val, how you doing?

Good. How's it going?

927

but I will be.
You hear me? I will be.

1449

And there is nothing that
you can do about that.

1450

- I tried to help you.
- Hey! Hey, man!

1451
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,639
You came to me and said, give me
a day to show me what you got.

1452
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,021
I gave you a day.

It's not good enough.

1454

So the answer to
your question is no!

1455
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,679
I do not give you my blessing.

I don't need your blessing.

This isn't Afghanistan. I'm not
about to buy her with a goat.

That girl loves me, man.

1459
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,719
That girl loves all of this.

1460
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,319
Breathe it in, because
it's in your face.

1461
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,055
I'm taking care of her, not you.

1462

- You?
- Me.

1463
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,747
You can't even take
care of yourself.

1464
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,759
You wouldn't last
one day out here.

1465
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,799
You think I'm gonna become a
cop and get myself killed?

1466
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,879
Leave her by herself?

1467
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,999
This conversation is over.

1468
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,119
Get in the car.

1469
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,639
This is your problem, man.

1470
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,479
It's why you don't
have no damn partner.

1471
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,839
You walk around here by yourself

1472
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,279
because you don't trust nobody.

1473
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,559
Eventually you're gonna have
to trust somebody, James.

1474
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,199
I'd never trust you.

1475
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,229
I'd never trust you with my life.

1476
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,239
And my family's life?

1477
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,666
Can you comprehend that?

1478
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,359
You don't even know
why you don't like me.

1479
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,599
Tell me why! You don't know why.

1480
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,199
Because you don't know me, James.

1481

trait for a cop.

1486

What you mean?

Well, after three years and all that
overtime, you finally got your man.

I didn't get my man.

Actually, I didn't.

- No.
- That was a look of respect, James.
