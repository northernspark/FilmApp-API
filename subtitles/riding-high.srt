2
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:40,191
J. L... Yes, J. L... Yes, J.L.

3
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,798
- I've been waiting a half-hour!
- Not now, Mel. I'm busy.

4
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,803
Got to get all his sons-in-law
on the phone.

5
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,635
Main, 674.

6
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,041
Board of directors' meeting tonight.
This is the 1 st, you know.

7
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,680
They all know it's the 1 st.

8
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,783
They know there's a meeting tonight.
The whole town knows it.

9
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,247
Higgins Iron Works?

10
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,889
Higgins, Higgins, Higgins.

11
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,683
That's not a family,

12
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,623
it's a disease!

13
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,392
Arthur Winslow talking.

14
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,500
Oh, yes, Mrs. Peterson. Yes.

15
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,037
I just want to remind you there's
a board of directors' meeting

16
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,072
at J.L.'s house tonight
at 7 sharp.

17
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,579
Oh, yes, Mrs. Peterson.

18
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,408
Oh, you know me,
"Never Late" Early.

19
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,990
No, Mrs. Peterson, Mr. Brooks
hasn't been in all day.

20
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,989
I don't know.

21
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,559
It's got to be cut lower.
I've told you 100 times, lower!

22
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,855
Madame, I told you 200 times,
there's a limitation.

23
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,497
There will be at least
1,000 people...

24
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,291
All right. So what?
It's my wedding, not my funeral!

25
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,059
- Who is it?
- Your father's secretary.

26
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,431
What does that old bag want? Hello?

27
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,231
Well, how do I know where
Dan Brooks is?

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,668
Please help me locate him!

29
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,639
You know how strict your father is
about the meetings.

30
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,244
Well, he's not under my bed.

31
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,074
All right, I'll get him to the meeting
as I got him to all the others.

32
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,511
He's probably out
with that stupid horse.

33
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,111
Come on, Whitey! You're heading
into the stretch. Let him roll!

34
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,289
Come on! Let him roll!
Let's see if we got a horse.

35
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,048
Kick it out of low, princess.
Come on.

36
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,818
Oh, Bill. Oh, Bill. Come on, boy.

37
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,696
- What'd he make it in?
- Huh?

38
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,530
- What'd he make it in?
- 1:42.

39
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,137
- Is that good?
- Good?

40
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,036
Honey, on a cowpath like this,
for a 3-year-old, that's flying.

41
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,972
Here, Bill. Come on, boy.

42
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,746
Mr. Brooks, this animal
just ain't human.

43
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,179
He's a flier, isn't he?

44
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,750
- What'd he do it in?
- 1:42.

45
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,182
Great day in a morning!

46
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,913
With me on him?
He's diseased with speed.

47
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,422
It's a nice way to be sick.
Isn't he a beauty, princess?

48
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,721
Oh, you said it.
Oh, we're proud of you, Broadway Bill.

49
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,694
Steady, Bill.

50
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,966
- How's that ankle?
- Feels cool.

51
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,930
- He made it.
- Well, what's this?

52
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,608
- <i>Pathé</i> news comes to Higginsville?
- No, that's Skeeter.

53
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,675
- Skeeter?
- Miss Alice taught him to do that.

54
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,345
- I have many talents.
- Well!

55
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,812
Broadway Bill, you got a mascot
like a stakes winner. Big stuff, huh?

56
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,043
Is it true horses get so attached to
mascots they won't run without them?

57
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,381
Yeah, that's true,
but I think a jockey's useful too.

58
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,057
Hey, Whitey, get those bandages off
and go to walking him, huh?

59
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,490
Dan? When you put racing shoes
on him, can I help you?

60
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:23,923
Huh?

61
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,121
Say, you know more about
this horse than I do.

62
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,061
You been hanging around
the stable quite a bit, huh?

63
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,496
Want to make something of it?

64
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,135
No, but don't you let
Emperor Higgins catch you.

65
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,804
He'll ship you off to the salt mines.

66
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,065
Emperor Higgins
doesn't even know I'm alive.

67
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,742
I'm just the young brat in the family.

68
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,376
Well, you will stay single.

69
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,273
Why don't you get married
and give him another son-in-law.

70
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,971
Yes, I know. Someone to take care
of another Higgins enterprise.

71
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,410
Not little Alice.

72
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,778
OK, but marriage is getting
popular, you know.

73
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,477
I'm going to post soon.
Don't get shut out.

74
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,051
Been a long time since I've seen
a horse work that good.

75
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,590
Dan, why don't you?

76
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,786
Yeah, I should. Why don't I what?

77
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,760
Imperial Race Track
opened last week.

78
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,366
Oh, no. No more of that hobo stuff
for Dan Brooks.

79
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,593
He's getting married.
Gonna be a solid citizen.

80
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,534
Don't do it, Dan. Don't marry a Higgins.
Don't marry any Higgins.

81
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,867
You'll just rot here,
like the rest of us.

82
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,941
Princess, you've got
a very attractive little nose,

83
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,306
but keep it out of my business
or I'll twist it off for you.

84
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,811
- You're a fool!
- Well, I'm a happy one.

85
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,915
I was just a race track mug
till I met your sister.

86
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,347
Now I'm general manager of
the Higgins Paper Box Company.

87
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,418
Prune juice! You've been dying
to get out of Higginsville

88
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,146
- ever since you came here.
- Oh, get her!

89
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,882
Your heart and soul are in horses,
and you're making paper boxes.

90
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,357
Four hundred thousand last month.
Or was it last year?

91
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,621
- You're scared, that's what you are.
- Who's scared?

92
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,389
Dan Brooks, horseman.

93
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,829
Dan Brooks,
just another Higgins slave.

94
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,732
Yeah? Well, at my salary,
slavery can come back.

95
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,509
- Mr. Brooks, it ain't fair. It ain't honest.
- What ain't honest?

96
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,735
- What do you mean?
- We been together for a long time,

97
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:47,845
and this is the mostest horse
we ever did have!

98
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,412
He's ready, Mr. Brooks.

99
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,175
Just picked up that truck
with my last 25 bucks.

100
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,377
He's ready. You know it better than
I do. We owe it to him. He's ready!

101
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,079
Yes, he's ready and you're ready,
but I'm not. Do you hear?

102
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,553
I got smart. I quit racing.

103
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,556
I'm gonna stay smart.

104
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,690
Hey, Bill, go on.

105
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,662
Go on, chase him, chase him.
Chase him!

106
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,065
Go on. That's it. Push him.

107
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:19,042
No. Now, I'm through. No! Now, leave
me alone. I'm through with racing.

108
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,078
Don't mess with me.
I'm a big paper-box man.

109
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,112
Yeah, attaboy.

110
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,648
Never mind, now. Break it up.

111
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,446
Never mind.

112
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,019
No, I don't want to play. No, I'm a big
business man. Gotta go to a meeting.

113
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,390
You can stop that dancing too.

114
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,431
I told you, I'm through with horses.
Go on! Go back to Whitey.

115
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,693
Go with Whitey. I don't want anything
to do with you. Go on!

116
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,871
Now go back. Give him some more.

117
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,630
Yeah, that's it.

118
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,869
You back again?
What do you want with me?

119
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,409
What do you want with me?
I'm through! I'm through with horses.

120
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,309
Gonna make the paper boxes.
Yeah! Yeah!

121
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,617
Now go give him some more.

122
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,947
Why, I'll kick you in your big...

123
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,545
- Good evening, Miss Margaret.
- Good evening. What is your name?

124
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,045
- Huh?
- Is Mr. Brooks ready yet?

125
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,685
Not quite.
The name is Clarence White.

126
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,865
<i>Wort say that rivers flow</i>

127
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,795
<i>Or day turns to night</i>

128
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,234
<i>But, darling</i>

129
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,535
<i>I'd say we've got a sure thing</i>

130
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,608
<i>All right</i>

131
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,476
<i>Wort say it's winter</i>

132
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:08,552
<i>When snow falls from above</i>

133
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,516
<i>But, darling</i>

134
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,558
<i>It's a sure thing we're</i>

135
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,392
<i>In love</i>

136
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,927
- Maggie!
- Darling!

137
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,862
Come here.

138
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,238
We'll never get to the meeting this way.
Come on, slowpoke.

139
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,241
Wait a minute.
Not so fast, me proud beauty.

140
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,711
What's your hurry?
What's the rush?

141
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,177
Anybody ever tell you you're
the most beautiful girl in the world?

142
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,614
Just the world?

143
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:46,019
I'll include all the available planets,
the stratosphere, the outer space,

144
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,887
New York, New Haven and Hartford,
leaving on track five.

145
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,960
- That's better.
- Here.

146
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,425
- Come on.
- What's the hurry?

147
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,929
Come on, darling.

148
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,693
I may not be the most beautiful,
but I'm the happiest girl in the world.

149
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,235
The invitations were mailed today,
and you should see my dress.

150
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,668
- A stunner?
- Only three weeks more, darling.

151
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,399
The wedding will be the biggest thing
since Texas joined the Union.

152
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,703
- That was a big day.
- Good heavens!

153
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,608
- Even your dinner jacket smells horsy!
- What?

154
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,714
What do you use,
Equine No. 5?

155
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,544
You know he worked
a mile in 1:42 today?

156
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,980
- Who?
- Broadway Bill!

157
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,416
And with Whitey on him too.
Just sitting there, looking and cooking.

158
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,953
Why don't you come out
the next time he works.

159
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,385
I'll bet if you knew him,
you'd love him.

160
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,787
Oh, I like horses, all right.
Especially when they're racing.

161
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,621
- Didrt I meet you at the track?
- That's what you did.

162
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,229
Remember, when I leaned over
and asked you if you had a winner?

163
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,595
Oh, and I had a winner too. You.

164
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,429
- Ready?
- Sure, I'm ready. Flashy.

165
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,468
What kind of socks
are you wearing this time?

166
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,836
What difference does it make?

167
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,011
Dan, you've got to change them.
Quickly, where are the black ones?

168
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,940
They'll be under the table
all night anyhow.

169
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,944
If you got to know
Broadway Bill personally,

170
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,312
I'll bet you'd be crazy about him.
Did I ever tell you about his mother?

171
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,884
- She was blind, you know?
- Blind?

172
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,749
Yeah, stone-blind.
Beautifully bred mare, though.

173
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,185
Put those on, and hurry.

174
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,825
She had quite a problem
when the little colt arrived.

175
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,154
Naturally, she wanted to be near him,
but she couldn't,

176
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,558
because she couldn't find him.
It was pitiful to watch her.

177
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,360
She'd start in a little circle, and
the circle would get larger and larger.

178
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,161
She'd cover every foot of that field,

179
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,839
but that little rascal, he'd just stay
a step ahead of her all the time.

180
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,667
She couldn't reach him, and at night,

181
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,866
boy, at night,
what a ruckus she'd raise!

182
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,172
I'd have to get up, find Broadway Bill,
take him in to her. But I licked it.

183
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:19,215
You know what I did? I got a bell.
An ordinary dinner bell.

184
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,409
I tied it around his neck.
Solved her problem.

185
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,816
- She'd hear the bell, find the colt.
- Clever.

186
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,251
Put the other one on.

187
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,119
After a while,
an amazing thing happened.

188
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,624
You won't believe this,
but this is absolutely true.

189
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,230
That little colt, he realized that
something was wrong with his mother.

190
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,024
And he wouldn't leave her side.

191
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,203
Gee, I can remember we used to turn
the colts and the mares out.

192
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,429
They'd head lickety-split
for the field, just kicking,

193
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,337
playing, buckjumping,
but not Broadway Bill. No, sir.

194
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,774
He'd stay with her, and he'd lead
her every step of the way, over rocks,

195
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,040
around the ditches and the ruts
until he got her safely into the pasture.

196
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,741
You'd just have to love a little egg
like that, wouldn't you?

197
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,318
- I don't blame you.
- That's him.

198
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,614
Out in the barn,
that's Broadway Bill!

199
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,955
Well, then a lot of bad breaks
came along.

200
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,095
Couldrt win a race, horses got sick,
lost a few of them,

201
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,093
and up to my ears in debts.

202
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,823
Then you came along,
asked me if I had a winner.

203
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,233
So in three days, I sold the whole kit
and caboodle of them, you remember?

204
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,930
Paid off my debts and proposed to you
every hour on the hour.

205
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,600
Promised to quit racing
and followed you here to Higginsville,

206
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,473
but I couldn't come without
Broadway Bill.

207
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,478
I figured maybe after
our kids grew up,

208
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,981
he'd make a nice little horse
for them to hack around on.

209
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,710
Whitey... Couldrt leave old Whitey,

210
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,754
not after all we'd been through
together, working and starving.

211
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,084
So Broadway Bill's a 3-year-old now,
and he's a runner!

212
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:37,091
- Maybe a great runner, Maggie.
- Oh, it's a wonderful story, darling.

213
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,991
But, as you say,
you're through with racing.

214
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,893
And if you think that old mare's
got a problem,

215
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,466
I've gotta get you to that meeting
on time or be disowned. Come on!

216
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,500
Maggie, wait, wait.
Let's duck the meeting tonight.

217
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,933
- Duck the meeting?
- Yeah. Let's you and I

218
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,039
go somewhere and just sit
under the moon together and talk.

219
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,469
I want to talk about a few things.

220
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,871
Father would throw a royal fit.
You know we've got to go.

221
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,570
Why? What difference does it make?
He does all the talking anyhow.

222
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,339
We just sit there
with our heads on hinges.

223
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,747
"Yes, J.L. Of course, J.L.
Oh, you're so right, J.L."

224
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,217
I'd like to go to one of those meetings
with a stiff neck sometime.

225
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,617
- Throw the whole thing out of tempo.
- Oh, Dan, stop.

226
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,953
Father has great plans for you.
That's why the others are all so jealous.

227
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,959
Yeah, "the others". Look, let's go over
and stand in front of the house

228
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,563
and throw rocks at the meeting.
What do you say?

229
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,234
- Dan, it's almost 7.
- Well, do you want to throw rocks?

230
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,130
No. And neither would you
if you had any sense.

231
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,737
Remember, you'll be calling those
meetings someday. Now, come on!

232
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,170
We can't afford to be late again.
You know Father. Come on!

233
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,603
"Yes, J.L. Yes, J.L."

234
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,009
- Good evening, Mrs. Early.
- Good evening, Johnson.

235
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,978
- Good evening, Johnson.
- Mr. Early.

236
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,977
- J.L.'s in the study.
- Thank you, Johnson.

237
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,781
Well, right on the dot.
"Never Late" Early, they call me.

238
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,364
No more stale jokes.

239
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,157
And don't be so scared of him.

240
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,994
Who's scared?

241
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,036
Good evening, J.L.

242
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,473
- Evening.
- Father.

243
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,044
Well, right on the dot.
"Never Late" Early, they call me.

244
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,476
Henry.

245
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,548
Hi.

246
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,693
Evening, Father.

247
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,489
Don't scold me. I'm on time.

248
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,564
- Good evening, Mrs. Winslow.
- Good evening.

249
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,762
- Mr. Winslow.
- Good evening, Johnson.

250
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,708
- J.L.'s in the study.
- Oh, thank you, Johnson.

251
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,380
You may not be the smartest, Arthur,
but you're the best-Iooking.

252
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,252
Thank you!

253
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,194
- Good evening, Father.
- Evening.

254
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,338
J.L. Evening.

255
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,903
- Good evening, Johnson.
- Good evening, Miss Margaret.

256
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,582
J.L. Is in the study.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

257
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,183
Dan.

258
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:37,474
- Hello, Dan, I see you made it.
- Oh, she went to the whip on me. Hi.

259
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,973
- Father.
- J.L.

260
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,702
- We're late.
- Well, that's my fault.

261
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,744
There was sort of a hassle
down at the box factory.

262
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,176
You see, we had this big box...

263
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,113
- We'll get started.
- We...

264
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,388
- How do I get out of this box?
- Leave Higginsville.

265
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,289
Still in there punching, aren't you?
What's on the agenda for this evening?

266
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,862
Oh, soup, cold lamb
and the financial report.

267
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,262
Sounds exciting.
Say, would there be such a thing as

268
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,994
- a slug of whiskey around the house?
- In this house?

269
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,230
Isn't anything ever changed
around this mausoleum?

270
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,069
- Yeah, bedspreads and underwear.
- The daily double.

271
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,889
Any of you got ulcers yet?

272
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,893
Well, here's hoping.

273
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:46,802
The purpose of this meeting is to elect
him permanent member of this board.

274
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:50,243
Now that he's to become
a permanent member of this family.

275
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,381
But first, some good news.

276
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:04,293
Acme Lumber Company.
Bought it today at our own figure.

277
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,594
- Very good, J.L. Very good, J.L.
- Fine, fine, J.L. Fine. Fine. Fine.

278
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,702
10:05 this morning, it became the
Higgins Lumber Company. Approved?

279
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,899
- Why, of course, J.L. Splendid!
- Seems like a wise move, J.L.

280
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,735
- You approve?
- Huh?

281
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:24,473
Oh, naturally, J.L. Top-hole, J.L.
Of course, J.L.

282
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,478
Present has no active head.

283
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,455
It shall remain so.

284
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,958
Courage, men.

285
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,668
It'll remain so until empty chair
is suitably occupied.

286
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,436
If you mean me, Dad,
you're wasting your time.

287
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,632
- What's that?
- You might as well forget it.

288
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,074
The man I marry won't care
for the lumber business.

289
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,805
- Don't be impudent, Alice.
- I'm sorry.

290
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,247
That's OK, J.L.
You're still batting...

291
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,511
...750.
- Maybe only 500.

292
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,853
Dinner.

293
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,133
Meeting's opened.
Higgins Enterprise is doing fine,

294
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,246
except the Higgins
Paper Box Company.

295
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,879
Sales, way below normal.

296
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,344
Higgins Special, nationally known,
off 22 percent.

297
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,424
- Mr. Brooks, any explanation?
- Maybe paper bags are catching on.

298
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,853
Could be.

299
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,192
Maybe it's off gallivanting
with a ridiculous horse.

300
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,628
Father!

301
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,094
Let's get back to
the paper boxes, huh?

302
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,329
Yes, indeed, let's.

303
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,205
You came to this town
over a year ago. Penniless,

304
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,244
questionable background.
Racetrack profession, I believe.

305
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,841
"Reformed gypsy", you said.

306
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,451
You and Margaret wanted
to get married.

307
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,143
I was not impressed.

308
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,413
I got mine the hard way.

309
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,392
Ulcers.

310
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,654
But we decided upon
a probationary period.

311
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,993
I put you at the head of
the Higgins Paper Box Company,

312
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,227
the most successful
of the Higgins Enterprises.

313
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,937
You accepted, with gratitude.

314
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,131
You were the envy of Mr. Winslow
and Mr. Early.

315
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,640
- Oh, no, J.L.
- No, J.L., no.

316
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:38,016
It isn't paper bags,
my reformed gypsy friend, it's neglect.

317
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,581
Shameful neglect.

318
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,880
Now, Margaret's divorce, final.

319
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,853
Wedding, set. Expensive.

320
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,462
Four daughters, no sons.
Have to accept what they bring in.

321
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,028
But I don't want to go through

322
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,099
what I had to go through with the last
fellow who sat in that chair.

323
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,134
- A hockey player, I believe.
- Thank you, Father.

324
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,131
Beginning tomorrow,
exclusively paper boxes.

325
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,276
Beginning tomorrow,
get rid of that horse.

326
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,138
See that it's done.

327
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,613
Now, back to Acme Lumber Company.

328
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,342
I've had their statement gone
over thoroughly.

329
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,818
I find a book value of
17 dollars a share.

330
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,958
This allows for depreciation
in current year's taxes.

331
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,493
Figures follow.
Cash on hand in banks: $13,764...

332
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,096
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute, J.L. Wait here.

333
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,598
You may be interested to hear I have
no intention of disposing of that horse.

334
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,429
Matter of fact, I'm leaving
Higginsville in the morning.

335
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,833
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Alice!

336
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,008
Everything you said is true.
I have neglected the business.

337
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,073
It isn't that I don't appreciate what
you've done for me. It's just that...

338
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,077
...I'm not built for it, that's all.

339
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,217
Take handsome here. He was meant
to spend his life in an ironworks.

340
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,410
And Never Late Early.
He even looks like a lampshade.

341
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,852
But me, boy, I have nothing
in common with paper boxes.

342
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,619
Yes, I've...

343
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,122
I took it for a year, on probation.

344
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,493
Isn't that beautiful, probation?
Like a criminal. What was my crime?

345
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,136
I fell in love with your daughter,
so I get a year in a paper-box factory,

346
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,965
where, since 1889, the Higgins
Enterprises have made a paper box

347
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,731
for 4 cents and sold it for 5.

348
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,272
If only once we could have made
it for 5 and sold it for 4.

349
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,207
That would've been
a welcome switch.

350
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,311
I know I sound crazy to you.
Maybe I am.

351
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,881
Maybe you strike me the same way.

352
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,277
It's just that you're only interested
in one thing:

353
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,818
Accumulating wealth and gobbling up
the little fellow, like this morning

354
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,354
when you snatched the Acme Lumber
Company from some poor little Joe

355
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,083
who spent his lifetime building it up.
I hope it made you happy.

356
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,556
- Young man! Don't...
- Look at you!

357
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,322
Look at you! You haven't had
a vacation in over 40 years.

358
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,932
You're just rotting away here
in this little kingdom of yours!

359
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,228
Well, that's not my idea of a way
to live, and it isn't Margaret's either.

360
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,065
And another thing,
I wouldn't get rid of that racehorse

361
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,900
for you or anybody else in the world!

362
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,599
You wait! Someday you're gonna
take off your hat to Broadway Bill.

363
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,306
That's true. I was broke when I came,
and I'm going to leave the same way.

364
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,380
I'm turning back every dime
of the Higgins money.

365
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,142
Margaret and I'll make good
in our own way.

366
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,287
We'll get married in some nice,
little church like decent people.

367
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,388
If it's all the same to you,
you can accept my two weeks' notice

368
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,024
two weeks ahead of time.
Margaret, I'll wait for you in the car.

369
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:02,488
Dan!

370
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,286
Let's get on with the meeting, Father.

371
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,294
Darling, you come back and sit down
and behave yourself.

372
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,759
Margaret, this is what I wanted
to talk to you about tonight.

373
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,666
Come on. Let's get out of this prison,
honey. It's fun to be free. You'll love it!

374
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,137
And Broadway Bill just isn't any horse.
He's a stakes winner.

375
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,537
He's got speed and stamina,
and he'll stay.

376
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,576
A man waits a lifetime
for such a horse, Margaret.

377
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,042
All right, all right.

378
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,682
But the invitations are out,
2,000 of them.

379
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,512
- Do you want to ruin it all?
- Let's get married right away, tonight.

380
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,245
If I sit down in this chair again, I'm
gonna wind up just like those two guys.

381
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,981
A Christmas tiger.
"Yes, J.L. Yes, J.L."

382
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,820
I can't handle it.
I'll be at the apartment, packing.

383
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,461
- Go with him, Margaret. Go with him!
- Oh, shut up!

384
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,132
Well, Emperor Higgins,
I hope you had fun.

385
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,433
Meeting is adjourned.

386
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,373
<i>All a millionaire's money</i>

387
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:56,809
<i>Couldrt build a better abode</i>

388
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,779
<i>Than that someplace</i>

389
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:04,786
<i>On Anywhere Road</i>

390
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,548
You might have
something there at that.

391
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:10,125
Oh, yes, boss. Come on, perk up.

392
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,561
<i>My new address will be someplace</i>

393
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,025
<i>On Anywhere Road</i>

394
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,307
<i>It's the prettiest someplace</i>

395
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,441
<i>On Anywhere Road</i>

396
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,043
<i>Anywhere Road</i>

397
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:32,182
<i>Got the fanciest rooftop</i>
<i>Made of sky</i>

398
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:39,317
<i>Independently lucky am I</i>

399
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,286
- <i>Don't need a nickel</i>
- <i>Don't need a nickel</i>

400
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,691
<i>I feel at home when I'm someplace</i>

401
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,660
<i>On Anywhere Road</i>

402
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,198
- <i>Heading for nowhere</i>
- Yes!

403
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,498
<i>Living up to the vagabond code</i>

404
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,701
<i>And all a millionaire's money</i>

405
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,582

<i>Than my someplace</i>
<i>On Anywhere Road</i>

407
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,557
Programs, programs.

408
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,736
What does the star mean in front
of the horse's name?

409
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,633
I don't know, kid. I think the trainer's
got a boy in the service, probably.

410
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,740
I don't know.

411
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,272
Park him and go over to see
the racing secretary.

412
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,780
Yes, sir.

413
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,613
- Hey, buddy, what's going on?
- They're unloading Gallant Lady!

414
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,051
Gallant Lady! Oh, this I gotta see!

415
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,784
Hey, Bill, here's that great champion
you're going to trim.

416
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,694
Hey, Bradshaw!
Bradshaw, come here!

417
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,763
- Yes, Mr. Whitehall.
- Get all these people out of the way.

418
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,828
- And where do you think you're going?
- Don't race your motor, Mike.

419
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,902
Never mind, Mike. Pat's the name.
Get back.

420
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,631
Pat, let me see this horse.

421
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,070
Now, look here, you blighters.

422
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,837
I'm not going to bring Gallant Lady
out before a rabble like this.

423
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:11,015
She's not used to it. She's too nervous.
Get off the platform, will you?

424
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,514
You hear what the man said?
Now get back and take it easy, will you?

425
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,778
- Officer, discharge your duty!
- Aw, shut up, you foreigner.

426
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,452
- All clear, Mr. Whitehall.
- Oh, all clear, eh?

427
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,152
Good. All right, get her out of here.
Bring that pony out first.

428
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,392
All right, bring her out.

429
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,501
Keep her head down. Watch
her feet and look at her hips.

430
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,166
- That's a good-Iooking filly, isn't she?
- Certainly is.

431
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,170
Don't crowd her.

432
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,412
Well, hello.
Win, Place and Show, huh?

433
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,947
How are you, Mr. Howard?
Dan Brooks, you remember me?

434
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,016
Yeah, sure. That your outfit?

435
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,950
That's the transportation department
of the Dan Brooks Stable.

436
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,590
- What are you hauling today?
- The winner of the Imperial Derby.

437
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,316
- So? Want a tip?
- Sure. What?

438
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,119
Enter the truck instead.

439
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,196
- Who's getting your action?
- I only bet on sure things.

440
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,458
- Gallant Lady.
- Oh, isn't that too bad?

441
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,365
Gallant Lady's going to be seeing
a lot of that come derby day.

442
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,840
- I thought we were betting on Sun Up.
- Why don't you broadcast it.

443
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,245
- There you are.
- OK. All made out, huh?

444
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,419
"Broadway Bill by Burning Ginger,
out of Mary D."

445
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,848
Well, at least he's bred for speed.

446
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,318
- Oh, he can scamper.
- Now, Dan, you'll have to supply

447
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,719
three photos of his "night eyes"
for the Protective Bureau.

448
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,450
You mean the little wart
inside the hock?

449
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,754
Yes, it's a new gag.
That's different on all horses,

450
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,794
- like fingerprints on a human.
- Very tricky.

451
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,024
- Here's your condition book.
- Yes, sir.

452
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,168
Here are your owners' badges.

453
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,770
Say, what's this about your wanting
to enter him in the Imperial Derby?

454
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,634
Why, sure!
We're gonna come back in style, boy!

455
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,537
Don't be a sucker, Dan.

456
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,507
You don't think he'd beat the champ,
Gallant Lady, do you?

457
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,078
What do you mean? He'll pull a spring
wagon and tie that old mare in a knot.

458
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,510
Come on, what's the entry fee?

459
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,946
- I gotta get out of here.
- OK, all right, you win.

460
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,019
It looks like you wrapped all your horse
sense in one of those paper boxes.

461
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,883
Make out the stake blank.
It's $500.

462
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,123
Five hundred dollars?

463
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:06,255
Well, it's a $25,000 race.
I guess 500 is a fair fee.

464
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,091
- Wouldrt you think, Mr. White?
- Peanuts.

465
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,325
You want to make out
a check right now, Dan?

466
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,561
- Now? Right...? Right now?
- Well, you don't have to.

467
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,673
You can do it the day before the race.
Two weeks off, if you like.

468
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,843
- I like.
- I thought you would.

469
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,774
But you'll have to nominate him
before 6 tonight. This is the last day.

470
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,312
I've got the nominating fee right here.
Yes, sir, $25, huh?

471
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,110
- Fifty dollars now, Dan.
- Fifty?

472
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,980
Things have gone up
in the last couple of years.

473
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,247
Say, Collins, how come
4 extra pounds on my horse?

474
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,822
What do you wanna do,
break him down?

475
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,959
He won his last two, didn't he?
You wanna win them all?

476
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,026
And another thing.
I'm not going to enter another horse

477
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,220
until you loosen up that track,
Mr. Pencil-Pusher.

478
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,660
If you didn't have blind staggers,

479
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,800
you could look out and see them
harrowing the track right now.

480
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,264
And don't call me "Pencil-Pusher".

481
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,335
I'll go to Santa Anita,
where I'll get a break.

482
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,770
You can go to... Oh, nothing but beefs.
Now, where are we, Dan?

483
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,435
I'm up to 43. Oh...

484
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,542
Mad money. Forty-four.

485
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,977
I have 44.
Forty-four, 44, 44, we need 50.

486
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,583
Oh, ho, Whitey, let me hear
from you. I have 44, need 50.

487
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,413
Sure would surprise me.
You take a look in the vault.

488
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:08,082
Well, the ootbay national ankbay.
Let's see what we have here.

489
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,989
Bless my soul, who would have
thought that was in there?

490
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,994
- Came a little hard, didn't it?
- Yes, sir.

491
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,963
A Ionely, lovely little <i>finif.</i>
Thank you, brother White.

492
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,568
We have 49, need 50. Have 49,
need 50. We have 49, need 50.

493
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,261
Oh, ho, we have 49, need 50.
Have 49...

494
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,134
- Fifty!
- Thank you, sir.

495
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,536
You are a gentleman. If you're
ever down in Bourbon County,

496
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,645
the smokehouse's full of hog meat,
and we got juleps 9 feet tall.

497
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,405
I guess we're all nuts!

498
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,140
But if this ever gets around,
I'll run you right off this track.

499
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,979
Oh, nix cracken, Jimmy Bracken,
I'm as silent as the tomb.

500
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,484
- There you are.
- Thank you.

501
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,681
- Now we'll have to have a stall.
- Stall. Now you got me.

502
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,257
Not a stall left on the track.

503
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,859
What do you want me to do,
tie up under a tree?

504
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:46,257
I was saving one
for you gypsies, but,

505
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,297
well, that Gallant Lady outfit put
the bee on me for the whole shebang.

506
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,629
- You know Gallant Lady, name horse.
- Oh, yeah, pulls in the public, I guess.

507
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,566
Yes, she does.
Oh, wait a minute, now.

508
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,708
I have got one barn. Old Pop Jones',
over here on Maple Street.

509
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,877
- Not in very good shape, though.
- Oh, we don't care.

510
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,875
- Broadway Bill's no snob. We'll take it.
- Good.

511
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,604
And thank you, Mr. Pencil-Pusher.

512
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,510
Good luck, Dan,
and don't forget those photos.

513
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,241
- Oh, no, we'll have them.
- Bye, Whitey.

514
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,682
Say, Collins, what are you doing,
plowing up the track?

515
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:13,517
What is this, a corn field?
Gallant Lady won't run on a soft track.

516
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,853
Now, I told you that. So help me,
I'll scratch her right out of the derby.

517
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,427
Will you take it easy, Mr. Whitehall?

518
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,120
That track will be lightning-fast
come derby day.

519
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,027
I am doing this track a favor
by entering Gallant Lady,

520
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:28,672
and I want a fair shake, and don't
you forget it, you pencil-pusher!

521
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,175
Hey, he needs a saliva test, huh?

522
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:38,111
- Gallant Lady. Gallant Lady.
- Oh, Gallant Lady. Oh, my dear.

523
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,730
Nice and comfortable inside.

524
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,267
Pretty well broke in, I guess.

525
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,477
Well, I guess it's all right, Pop.

526
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,952
That'll be $25 dollars a week,
in advance.

527
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,183
- In advance of what?
- Well, before you move in.

528
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,590
Oh, we haven't moved in yet.
A few things I want to check.

529
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,425
Had some pretty fine horses
stay here.

530
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,328
- Did they survive?
- Eh?

531
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:33,129
Well, we won't quibble.
Now, who's the feed man?

532
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,999
- Eh?
- The feed man. Who's the feed man?

533
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,867
- Oh, the feed man.
- Yeah.

534
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,303
- Right here.
- You?

535
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,637
Well, now, that's a break, Whitey.
Pop's the feed man too.

536
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,643
Hallelujah!

537
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,474
Not too loud,
you'll wake up the termites.

538
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,081
Pop, there's a few things
we're gonna need.

539
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,118
We'll need some barley, some oats,
carrots, of course, and a little salt,

540
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,846
- about 10 pounds of salt.
- Is this for cash?

541
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,820
- Eh?
- Eh?

542
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,152
- Oh, you too?
- Oh, since I was a little shaver, yeah.

543
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:02,197
- Just this ear, though. OK here.
- I say, is this for cash?

544
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,301
Cash? Now, what's the matter
with you? Don't you trust me?

545
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,097
- Yeah, but I don't know you.
- Well, I don't know you.

546
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,433
- But it's my barn.
- But it's my horse.

547
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,667
And another thing,
we'll need some cots.

548
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,504
- Eh?
- Some cots. C-O-T-S.

549
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,203
- You know, to sleep on.
- You're going to sleep in here?

550
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,815
Certainly! You don't think...

551
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,351
Pop, that's the horse that's going
to win the Imperial Derby.

552
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,648
I couldn't let him sleep
in here all by himself.

553
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,985
Now, come on, Pop, get on the ball.
Wake up! Come alive!

554
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,061
We're letting you in on a sure thing,
chance to pick up a bankroll.

555
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,787
- This horse is a sleeper.
- He's a what?

556
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,399
- He's a sleeper! A sleeper!
- You want a cot for the horse too?

557
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,272
Say, he's a riot, isn't he? Pop, you're
a card. You ought to be in vaudeville.

558
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,739
You're a riot!
Look, now. Come on, get on the ball.

559
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,505
We gotta get some food in here for this
horse. Keep him on edge. Keep him fit.

560
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,341
Get the stuff in here, now.
It's feeding time.

561
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,517
Got him fit and get him ready.
Come on, move, move!

562
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,083
- Whitey?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Brooks.

563
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,720
Remind me to get down to the bank in
the morning and make that deposit.

564
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,517
Yes, sir. It ain't safe to be carrying
that money around in your pocket.

565
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,421
No, it wearies a body.

566
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,240
Mr. Brooks, you certainly
got some funny ideas.

567
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,178
- Why?
- When I go out to borrow money,

568
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,750
I generally wear my old clothes,
my old shoes and things.

569
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,615
It's plain to see you don't appreciate the
secret of the race track, then, Whitey.

570
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,190
Gotta put on a front. If you look hungry
and down-at-the-mouth, you're dead.

571
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,487
Now, if these threads of mine impress
Professor Pettigrew sufficiently,

572
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,290
- our enforced diet is over.
- Who's Professor Pettigrew?

573
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,434
Who's Professor Pettigrew? Why,
he's a gentleman, a profound scholar

574
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,002
and a fellow you can bite
for a fast buck if he's got it.

575
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,139
- I hope he's got it.
- Oh, he's got it, all right.

576
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,365
The grapevine tells me
that the professor is literally

577
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,168
infested with the green stuff.

578
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,005
As a matter of fact,
he's worked out a system,

579
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,238
and he's had 15 straight winners.

580
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,547
- Professor Pettigrew!
- Yes, angel?

581
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,413
Take your feet off
my needlepoint chair!

582
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,451
Yes, chicken.

583
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,386
Happy, at long last, eureka!

584
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,323
For 15 years, ever since I left
the faculty of Yale University,

585
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,930
in utter boredom, I have been working
on the Pettigrew system

586
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:18,125
for beating the mutuels.
And now, voilá!

587
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,762
You know, he's beginning to believe
that Yale baloney himself.

588
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,040
I've had my ups and downs,
but today

589
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,437
I can finally say that my system
is infallible.

590
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:30,944
It certainly is. Fifteen straight losers.
How infallible can you get?

591
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,649
Is that so?

592
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,284
There, Einstein. Gin.

593
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:40,082
By an investment of a paltry $50,
I can show a profit of a $165,000

594
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,759
- within two weeks!
- I read my fairy tales at night.

595
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,293
But it'll cease to be a fairy tale
when I get the 50.

596
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,464
Where you gonna get it,
from vinegar-puss?

597
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,495
- Professor Pettigrew!
- Yes, my love.

598
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,564
I'll get the 50 from the finest
gentleman that ever raced a horse:

599
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,434
Dan Brooks,
a very good friend of mine.

600
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,270
Anybody who had 50 bucks
wouldn't be a friend of yours.

601
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,471
Is that so? Well, Dan Brooks is a
captain of industry, owns a paper mill,

602
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,944
and he's never turned me down yet.

603
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,778
And what's more, we're going
to be his guests at lunch today.

604
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,022
- He's going to buy us lunch?
- At the Greenview Club, laddie,

605
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,248
where even the busboys have
to be bank presidents.

606
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:18,259
How do we get inside that place?
Disguised as salads?

607
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,294
You overlook the power
of culture, my friend.

608
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,897
I merely phoned them and said,

609
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,728
"Professor Pettigrew of Yale
is lunching with Mr. Brooks,

610
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:27,097
"the noted tycoon.
Prepare a table, please."

611
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,239
Oh, by the way,
have you a dime for carfare?

612
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,635
I never carry any large
denominations.

613
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,538
I see. Very well, we'll walk.

614
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,770
Now, the good professor's
been kind enough to invite me

615
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,005
to lunch with him at
the exclusive Greenview Club,

616
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,740
where the blue blood flows like water

617
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,580
and the carpets are thicker
than porterhouse steaks.

618
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,414
Wish me luck, huh?

619
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,324
And if you can't get the money,

620
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,661
bring me back a piece of that
thick carpet. Medium brown.

621
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,478
- Here we are, Mr. Brooks.
- Oh, Dan.

622
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:17,381
- Dan, my boy. Well, this is a pleasure.
- Professor.

623
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,816
Capital.

624
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,718
Oh, hello, hello. How are you?
Glad to see you.

625
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,156
Please lower your voices.
Rule of the club.

626
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,795
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down, professor.

627
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,989
I took the liberty of bringing my
business associate, Oscar McGuire.

628
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,532
Oscar, this is Dan Brooks.

629
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,204
- How are you, sir?
- Stop me if I'm breathing too loud.

630
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,236
Yeah, keep it soft,
or we'll get the heave-ho.

631
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,705
This, gentlemen,
this is an occasion.

632
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:42,544
After the separation of many years,
Damon and Pythias are reunited.

633
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,975
Isn't this great?

634
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,412
- Pythias.
- Damon, old pal.

635
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,608
Waiter, a bottle of champagne
for auld lang syne.

636
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,845
Yes, and bring a thick steak
for auld Pythias too.

637
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,545
- Yes, sir.
- Bring the entire menu.

638
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,248
- Fill up the table. Bring everything.
- Bring everything on.

639
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,452
- And for you?
- Anything. I just came in to get warm.

640
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,461
Say, your friend's pretty amusing,
isn't he?

641
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,998
He comes up with some polite stuff.
Say, professor,

642
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,727
- I hear you're in the upper brackets.
- <i>Comme ci, comme ca.</i>

643
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,168
- <i>Parlez francais</i>, huh?
- After all, a mars wealth

644
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,035
- is the friendship of those he admires.
- That's a beautiful sentiment.

645
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,143
Well-put too.
But I've heard some things about you.

646
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,142
I hear you've got a system,
and it's rolling.

647
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,974
They tell me you're knocking
the ponies dead.

648
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,615
They say that you won
more money the other day

649
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,148
than you could carry away
from the race track.

650
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,747
True or false?

651
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,755
- Eh, how about you?
- Well, I can't complain.

652
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,450
- My horse is eating.
- I...

653
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:37,461
Modesty becomes you, Dan.
You great big industrialist.

654
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,801
Wait a minute.
We'll get thrown out of here.

655
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,529
You know, I always said,
"Dan Brooks.

656
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,935
"There's one man that
will really come through." Eh?

657
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,111
Yeah, you know what I've always
said about you, professor,

658
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,541
"You're a winner in my book.
A true-blue friend."

659
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:53,274
- How long does this go on?
- We're old pals, the social...

660
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,611
The bubbly has arrived.
Well, well.

661
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,948
I'm delighted for this opportunity to
repay your past favors, Dan, my boy.

662
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,022
Well, thank you, professor.
You're very sweet.

663
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:04,388
- I have a little mathematical certainty.
- Yes?

664
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:12,068
I have a little mathematical certainty
that should net us precisely $160,000.

665
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,101
- Oh, yeah?
- I wouldn't let anyone in on it but you.

666
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,533
Say, it sounds good.

667
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,002
- A toast.
- A toast.

668
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,176
A toast to the birth
of a new syndicate.

669
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,738
Pettigrew and Brooks.

670
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,244
Pettigrew supplies the brains.
Brooks supplies the money.

671
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:29,284
With a start of a mere $50
and the use of a little applied calculus,

672
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,114
I have a system
of parlays worked out...

673
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,780
Professor. Do these flapping
old ears of mine deceive me,

674
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,517
or did you come here to put
the bite on me for 50 bucks?

675
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,252
Oh, nothing as vulgar as that.

676
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:43,194
This is an investment
in the progress of science, my boy.

677
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,370
Well, don't look now, professor,
but we're back in the Dark Ages.

678
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,799
You mean?

679
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,406
I came here to put the bite
on you for a grand.

680
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,244
You mean to tell me you're broke?

681
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,476
Down to the bricks.

682
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,451
I beg your pardon?

683
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,190
And I came here...

684
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,956
- And you came here...
- I guess so.

685
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,367
Well, that's the funniest...

686
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,732
It's sensational.

687
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,237
What's so funny about that?

688
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,903
He's trying to bite me.
I'm trying to bite him.

689
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,946
Nobody's got a quarter.

690
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,084
Waiter, more champagne!

691
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,653
Gentlemen, please, please.
You're disturbing our patrons.

692
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,825
- I'm a little disturbed myself.
- Gentlemen.

693
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,994
- Professor. Come in the office.
- Yes?

694
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,255
What is the exact extent
of your financial embarrassment?

695
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,693
The lower depths.

696
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,662
Not even enough to pay
for this meal?

697
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:54,634
Not one bubble of this
very delightful champagne.

698
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,172
Well, maybe we can get
something back on the bottle, huh?

699
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,071
Hey, how's your wallet?

700
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,402
I don't know. I ate it yesterday.

701
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,449
Well, gentlemen. We appear
to be in something of a situation.

702
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,017
To the situation.

703
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,448
We might as well get
to like one another.

704
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,486
We're gonna be together
for at least 30 days.

705
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,250
- All right, gentlemen?
- Sure. Cut up another 30 days.

706
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,889
I have been mulling
the problem over in my mind.

707
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,430
- Yes?
- I have come to a simple

708
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,603
- but adequate conclusion.
- I know, we all drop dead.

709
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,931
- Oh, not that.
- Quiet, quiet, quiet.

710
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,131
- Gentlemen, just gaze about you.
- Yes?

711
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,675
All we have to do is to shock the
sensibilities of this prize collection

712
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:38,144
of stuffed shirts,
and we will be promptly ejected.

713
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,646
You know, I think he's got something.

714
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,841
What'll we do? Jump up and down
and slug each other with tea bags?

715
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,648
No, no, no, gentlemen.
We are in our cups.

716
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,586
Or as we used to say at Yale,
we are "stinko".

717
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,159
You mean we are loaded?

718
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,490
- We are fractured.
- Well, here we go.

719
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,863
<i>We are poor little lambs</i>
<i>Who have lost our way</i>

720
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,973
- Take the tenor.
- <i>Baa, baa, baa</i>

721
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:09,507
<i>We are little black sheep</i>
<i>Who have gone astray</i>

722
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,808
- Please.
- <i>Baa, baa, baa</i>

723
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,110
- Gentlemen, I beg of you.
- <i>Baa, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa</i>

724
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:22,657
<i>Gentlemen songsters off on a spree</i>
<i>Doomed from here to eternity</i>

725
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,385
Any decent restaurant would
have had us in the gutter by now.

726
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:29,088
- It's crawling with Yale men.
- Class of '82.

727
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,632
This is outrageous.
How can anyone eat in this bedlam?

728
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,634
Why, I understood this to be
a dignified, quiet <i>salle á manger</i>,

729
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,103
not a <i>Hofbräuhaus</i>.
We are leaving. Out of the way.

730
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,832
- Is anything wrong?
- Anything wrong?

731
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,477
You expect us to eat
in this collegiate cacophony?

732
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,840
You'll have a sharp note
from ASCAP, sir.

733
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,743
Yes, but you were the ones
who begun this.

734
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,078
Us? We're Harvard men.

735
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:55,314
<i>Baa, baa, baa</i>

736
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,730
Here we are.

737
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,693
Give.

738
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,027
- You drive a sharp bargain, my friend.
- Yes, sir.

739
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,067
That's the new light type.
You'll like that.

740
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:10,832
Yeah. Well, it ain't exactly
the size I wanted.

741
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,601
What do you want for a hamburger?
A telephone pole?

742
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,747
Oh, I ain't kicking,
but I should ought to have a hat or...

743
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,313
Hey.

744
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,815
- I'll give you a Coke for the hat.
- That's ridiculous.

745
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,680
We were just served champagne
for a song.

746
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,150
- Sure.
- Pie for the tie.

747
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,119
Wouldrt have anything
to hang myself with.

748
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,815
What's the matter with you fellows?
I thought you was hungry.

749
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,892
You should ought to have
some dessert or something.

750
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,564
Wait. Look these over.
We may be in for dinner tonight.

751
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,325
Spats. You should ought
to see me in spats.

752
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,196
I'd be a sight for sore eyes
in spats.

753
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,928
Wait till this peasant
finds out about shoes.

754
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,834
- Oh, I've got shoes.
- Congratulations.

755
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,372
I'll give you another hamburger
for the spats.

756
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,874
No, no, he's dedicating
a drive-in market this afternoon.

757
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,773
- Maybe tonight. We'll see.
- OK.

758
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,346
Dinner tonight for the hat,
spats and tie. Is that a deal?

759
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,881
Muff off.

760
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,314
We've got a little business to talk over.
Do you mind?

761
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,317
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

762
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,217
Say, if you've got anything
my wife can use...

763
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,790
Bring her in, and we'll cut her up.

764
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,522
Smart guy, huh?

765
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:11,191
Well, little man, what now? Raising
$500 may prove to be a slight hazard.

766
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,767
Professor, you've been
a disappointment.

767
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,437
Don't worry, my friend.
From now on,

768
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,471
my time and wisdom will be
devoted entirely to your welfare.

769
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,041
- I feel sorry for you.
- Oh, is that so?

770
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,940
Well, I have a brilliant idea already.
My ace in the hole.

771
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,637
- Edna.
- Edna?

772
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,079
A 50-to-1 shot.
You'd have to marry her first.

773
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,512
Who would Edna be?

774
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,983
That's the vinegar-puss landlady
at the boarding house.

775
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,485
Well, why would she expect him
to marry her?

776
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,818
Confidentially, Dan, I encouraged it.
An economic necessity, you know.

777
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,425
- I see.
- That'll give you an idea

778
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:38,696
- of what I've been driven to.
- "Driven to", my foot.

779
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,027
- Of what I've been driven to.
- "Driven to", my foot.

780
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:43,098
He'd rather make phony love
to that vinegar-puss than go to work.

781
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,531
Trouble is, he's got a vinegar-puss
in every race track town in the country.

782
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,069
It's kept me in food and lodging
for years. And you too.

783
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,570
Just... Now, wait a minute.

784
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,504
This vinegar-puss...
Whatever you call her.

785
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,736
Do you think she might fall
for a Ford truck?

786
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,813
That's what I would call
a perfect mating.

787
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,449
- What's the idea, Dan?
- Well, this Ford truck,

788
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,642
I don't think any used-car dealer
would have anything to do with it.

789
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,286
But maybe I could get 50 bucks
for it from her.

790
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,581
What's good 50 bucks
when you need 500?

791
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,849
There's a maiden race tomorrow
for $1,000.

792
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,050
We drop Broadway Bill in there.
We're home free.

793
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,389
But I need the 50 slugs
for the jockey and for expenses.

794
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,225
An inspiration, Dan. I'll make love
as I never made love before.

795
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:20,335
Vinegar-puss will own a Ford truck if
I have to make the supreme sacrifice.

796
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,371
Bravo. Let us pray such
a necessity never arises.

797
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,940
A 100-to-1 shot.

798
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,377
Hey, Happy.
Who do you like in the first race?

799
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,207
- Drop dead.
- Thanks.

800
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,286
- Is this it?
- Yes, my dear.

801
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,960
Sturdy and dependable.

802
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,129
- What's it supposed to be?
- Come, my beloved.

803
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,560
Broadway Bill is in the third race.
Allow me.

804
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:52,532
Oh, darling. I didn't sleep a wink
last night thinking about you.

805
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,601
- You make love so beautifully.
- Yes, I know.

806
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,296
But that's only the beginning, angel,
only the beginning.

807
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,277
What's the matter?
They've been there for ten minutes.

808
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,641
They're having trouble
with Broadway Bill.

809
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,710
Looks like we need some help
with that five horse.

810
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,409
Somebody get ahold of him.

811
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,316
But, sugar, we've still got time.

812
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:13,854
- Just 10 dollars.
- No.

813
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,457
- But 5 dollars.
- No.

814
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,718
- Well, 2 dollars.
- No.

815
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,657
But, sugar, I saw him
work out this morning.

816
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,626
I'm not going to bet.

817
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,857
I guess she's not going to bet,
professor.

818
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,504
I guess not, and I hope she gets
a worm in her Adam's apple.

819
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,570
Oh, sugar.

820
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,781
Where did that thing come from?

821
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,782
Get behind him and load him.

822
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,920
OK, Ray.
Get him up closer.

823
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,893
Now, sit still on him, rider.

824
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,194
Just sit still.

825
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,259
I don't think he's quite ready yet,
Mr. Brooks.

826
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,835
Oh, he's ready.
Sure, he's ready.

827
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,835
It's just that gate's new to him,
and all those horses.

828
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,373
Once they ring that bell, he'll be so far
out in front he'll feel at home again.

829
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,040
- You've got a bad horse here.
- Whoa.

830
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,351
Number five.

831
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,324
He's half-horse and half-nuts.

832
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,031
Put him on the school list
before he starts again.

833
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:42,341
Kind of homesick, huh, pal?

834
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,179
But you gotta take on
a little nourishment, you know.

835
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:48,840
Come on, Bill, here.
It's a carrot, Bill.

836
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,418
Come on, Bill.
Here. Go on.

837
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,580
When he turns down carrots,
he's lost interest in everything.

838
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,920
Yeah, I don't think he's going to perk
up either until that rooster comes.

839
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,356
Think she's gonna send him?

840
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,190
I don't know.
She hasn't even answered my letter.

841
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,857
- Skeeter.
- Skeeter.

842
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,196
- Skeeter.
- Skeeter.

843
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,999
- Oh, princess, am I glad to see you.
- Dan, you're smothering Skeeter.

844
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,575
- Oh, Skeeter, a thousand pardons.
- Hey, Bill. Look who's here.

845
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,837
It's your old buddy-buddy.

846
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,242
Here. Here, look here.
Look here.

847
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,247
Look here.

848
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,982
Ain't that beautiful?

849
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:28,681
Hello, Bill. Hello, Whitey.

850
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,291
- Good to see you.
- He's a new horse already.

851
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,587
Look at him.
I was gonna call a psychiatrist.

852
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,287
- Whitey, walk him a bit, will you?
- Why, sure. Come on, boy.

853
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:37,160
Go strut your stuff.

854
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,835
There he goes again.
He wants to go for a walk too.

855
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:43,200
Get out of here.
Princess, you're a lifesaver, really.

856
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,875
Isn't that a riot? Now, who'd think
those two would go for each other?

857
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,873
That's the way with a horse, though.
You get him a mascot.

858
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,808
He gets attached to him. You take
him away, boom, he falls apart.

859
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,107
But you didn't have to bring Skeeter.
Why didn't you ship him, honey?

860
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,012
I didn't know where
to paste the stamps.

861
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,153
Come on, sit down here.
Bring me up to date on everything.

862
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,720
- How's Margaret?
- Oh, she's all right. She's fine.

863
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,084
- How's she look? Beautiful as ever?
- Yeah, more so.

864
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,055
Well, come on, tell me.
When did you see her last?

865
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,489
How'd she look?
What was she wearing?

866
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,425
Did she have her hair
piled up in back the way I like it?

867
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,963
- Yes, it was up.
- Oh, I can just see her.

868
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,197
- You miss her, Dan?
- Oh, miss her and how.

869
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,030
Did she say anything
about coming down?

870
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,467
No, not to me, she didn't.

871
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,038
Well, how'd you know about
Skeeter, then?

872
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,904
Well, she let me read your letter.

873
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,339
She read it to me, that is.

874
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,741
And she said that I should
bring Skeeter down to you.

875
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,678
She did? You see. She's beginning
to weaken. I knew she would.

876
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:30,410
I'll have her out of Higginsville quicker
than you can say, "Never Late Early".

877
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,952
Give her a big kiss for me
when you get back.

878
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,453
I would, but I'm not going back.

879
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,818
- What? Come on, infant, you're...
- No. No, I'm not.

880
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:39,086
- What have we here?
- It could be my purse.

881
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,230
The finance company has arrived.

882
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,023
- Are you my pal? True or false?
- True.

883
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,723
Then you'll hold still
for a light touch, I'm sure.

884
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,493
- How light?
- Let's see what you're holding here.

885
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:50,537
Lipstick, eyebrow pencil, comb,
compact, things and...

886
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,504
Oh, pay dirt.

887
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:55,701
- I'll take this. You may have that.
- Well, that seems fair.

888
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,881
With this 50, I can enter Bill
in an overnight race tomorrow.

889
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,174
If he wins, I'll have 500
to put him in the big heat.

890
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,113
- Oh, he'll win.
- Oh, he'll walk his beat.

891
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,913
And after he wins the big one,
I'll pay you this back with interest.

892
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,714
Did I save you enough
for a train fare home?

893
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,358
It doesn't matter. I'm staying
at the hotel till after the race.

894
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,959
- No, no.
- Yes, I am.

895
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,129
- Oh, no, you're on your way.
- Don't be so patronizing.

896
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,661
- I'm staying.
- You can't stay.

897
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,792
You can't hang around
a race track town all alone.

898
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,865
Well, why not?

899
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:23,669
Well, for one thing, you're developing
into a very tasty little dish.

900
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,839
You think I'll have any
difficulty down here?

901
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,739
There's a lot of characters I know
that would just love

902
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,709
to add you to their
crockery collection.

903
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,712
Fine. I'll get myself a rosy-cheeked
peasant and get married.

904
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:37,409
Great. Great.
<i>L'amour</i> comes to <i>la Princesse</i>, huh?

905
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,282
Now you're talk...
I tell you what.

906
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,320
Why don't you save yourself
for old Dan, huh?

907
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,753
After Margaret gives me the brush,

908
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,825
why, you and I can hit the road
together, just like tramps.

909
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,256
<i>Oh, ho, for the open road</i>

910
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,192
- Wort that be dandy?
- Yeah, that's a good idea

911
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,697
- if my peasant doesn't object.
- You've got him all picked out.

912
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,530
You've been operating since we left
Higginsville. What did you grab?

913
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,000
- Some big All-American, I'll bet.
- No.

914
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,639
Well, who, then?
Come on, tell Grandma...

915
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,468
Oh, don't be so smart. He's perfect.

916
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,871
He's the ideal man.
He's 11 feet tall.

917
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,071
He hasn't any ears,
and he eats little babies.

918
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,182
Here, wait a minute, princess.
Hey, wait a minute.

919
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,541
Princess, I'm sorry.

920
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,584
Come on. This is old dancing Dan,
your pal.

921
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,756
The fellow with the songs
and the lively patter.

922
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:17,085
Come on. Give us a smile, big.
Show the china.

923
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,923
Let's see them all.
That's better. That's better.

924
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,065
That's the princess
we love and adore.

925
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,701
Look, honey. You marry anybody
you want to, hear?

926
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,200
You go to the hotel and check in

927
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,803
and stick around for the race
if you wanna too.

928
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,736
It's your life. You live it.
That's what I've always preached.

929
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,773
Come on, sermors over.
School's out. Beat it now.

930
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:37,037
I gotta get Broadway Bill
used to the starting gate.

931
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,781
Horses I understand, fair.

932
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,513
But women...

933
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,055
- Whitey.
- Yes?

934
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:59,193
Hey, bubblehead. You mean you got
me up this morning just to see this?

935
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,665
Early bird, Happy. Early bird.

936
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,931
Take a deep breath of fresh air.
Get something in your lungs. Live.

937
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,469
Ride him up close, rider.

938
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:10,913
Hey, Sid.
I think he's catching on.

939
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,309
Yes, bring him back tomorrow,
and if he breaks all right,

940
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:14,779
I'll take him off the schooling list.

941
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,249
Thanks. Isn't it amazing what a
difference that little rooster makes?

942
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,682
Smile, Skeeter.

943
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,618
Why don't you slap a saddle
on the rooster.

944
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,418
- You might have a better chance.
- Oh, you think so, huh?

945
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,618
You'd holler if you're hung
with a new rope.

946
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,162
Hey, jock. This time don't pull him up.
Work him out a good mile, will you?

947
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,300
- I wanna clock him.
- All right, Mr. Brooks.

948
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,426
- I wanna clock him.
- All right, Mr. Brooks.

949
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,660
Ready his head.

950
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,289
Who's that black horse?
He's really traveling.

951
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,516
Oh, that's that Brooks' Broadway Bill
by Burning Ginger.

952
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,718
They all look good when
they're working alone.

953
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,954
There's nothing running this morning.
Come on, let's get out of here.

954
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,257
- I got a date.
- He's really moving.

955
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,770
Holy smoke, I wouldn't believe it.

956
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,811
- What'd he do it in?
- 1:39.

957
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,347
Crying to run all the way.

958
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,279
Shake that watch.
I think it's ad-libbing.

959
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:23,748
Why, he was sired by Pegasus.

960
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,218
Whitey, go get the champion
and cool him out and bring him in.

961
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,254
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir. 1:39.

962
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,621
How about that? I've never seen
a 3-year-old work...

963
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,591
Here comes a spy from
the Confederate Army.

964
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,264
Oh, we're cooked.

965
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,229
Well, Dad. I'm glad you came around.
We just clocked him.

966
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,130
Ninety-two dollars and 72 cents.

967
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,965
Oh, I love the way you ease
into a conversation.

968
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,073
I say, you should've been here.
You know what he worked in?

969
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,539
I don't give a hang.
I want this feed bill paid.

970
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,679
- Pop, I promised you...
- I can't pay my bills with promises.

971
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,815
You got no bank account, mister.
I checked up on you.

972
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,643
Either I get my money now,
or I go to the law.

973
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,376
Now, my dear friend,
if you're worried about a paltry 92.82,

974
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,179
my good friend here,
Professor Pettigrew,

975
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,085
will be only too happy to vouch for
my financial stability. Right, professor?

976
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,419
Why, of course, of course. Let's pay
this vulture off and be rid of him.

977
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,323
- How much is it, $1,000?
- Oh, no, no, professor.

978
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,327
It would be senseless
to break a big bill here.

979
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,432
Just tell him you guarantee
my obligations.

980
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,228
- To the full limit of my resources.
- There you are. You see?

981
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,961
I don't see nothing.
Never saw him before.

982
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,436
Never heard of him.
Looks like a phony to me.

983
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,332
- Eh?
- He's a rival tycoon.

984
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,772
This isn't funny.

985
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,105
No, I know, but he's really
one of the biggest operators...

986
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,215
I don't give a hang who he is,
I want my money.

987
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,941
Well, you're gonna get it.
But you don't understand.

988
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,347
You're not coordinating.
We're letting you in on a good thing.

989
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,682
Horse named Broadway Bill
just worked a mile in 1:39,

990
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,585
- with the jock sitting right against him.
- Eh?

991
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:37,885
- He worked the mile in 1:39.
- Wait a minute.

992
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,791
- What's the idea of telling him that?
- Mr. Cadwalliger, I...

993
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,726
I thought this was
a private syndicate.

994
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,027
I have a jolly good mind
to withdraw my $25,000.

995
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,796
- Now, now...
- I didn't invest $25,000

996
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,530
to have you slip the information
to a penny-ante feed man.

997
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:53,333
He's not that.
He's not at all.

998
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:55,670
Pop Jones is one of my oldest
and truest friends.

999
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,608
I don't care if he's your
half-wit brother.

1000
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,180
- But he can be trusted, I tell you.
- You can trust a mug

1001
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,908
with a puss like that.
I won't. I'm through.

1002
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,348
- Mr. Cadwalliger...
- Let him go.

1003
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,782
I shall assume his obligation.

1004
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,116
No, professor, you're in for
$50,000 already. That's enough.

1005
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,555
Why, it's a trifle, a trifle.
Your horse is good enough for me.

1006
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,092
- Come along. I'll wire my brokers.
- Well, sir, I...

1007
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,094
I hope I didn't cause you no trouble,
Mr. Brooks.

1008
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,097
Trouble? Don't you ever
let that happen again.

1009
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,361
No, no.

1010
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,505
Let what happen again?

1011
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,572
Mr. Brooks, don't drop our dinner.
It might bend.

1012
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,683
Don't you be belittling
these beans, boy.

1013
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,150
I'm just gonna let them simmer a little,
cut in a few of Bill's carrots,

1014
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,880
add a soupcon of paprika,
a dash of lemon.

1015
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:42,319
- You can cut out the lemon.
- Why?

1016
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,823
Because we're fresh out of them.

1017
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,825
Say. Looks like it's blowing up
a little rain, Whitey.

1018
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,864
Good for us tomorrow.
Old Bill loves the mud.

1019
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,433
Shower down, rain.
Let me hear from you.

1020
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,800
- Hey, somebody's in the barn.
- Hope it ain't the feed man.

1021
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,970
Oh, you.

1022
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,168
Welcome to
the Higgins Greasy Spoon.

1023
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,607
What's going on here?
What are you doing?

1024
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,748
Nothing much. It just seemed to me
this shack needed a womars touch.

1025
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,010
Look. You're a nice kid, but you can't
stake a claim around these diggings.

1026
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,915
We can take care of ourselves
all right, now beat it.

1027
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,612
You've been doing
a pretty sloppy job of it.

1028
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,519
You two look like you're
in the last stages of beriberi.

1029
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,216
What have you been living on, beans?

1030
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,693
Why is it all women want to play
Florence Nightingale?

1031
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,868
We've been eating like pigs,
haven't we, Whitey?

1032
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,196
That's the word.

1033
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,668
Besides, if you wanna hang around
here, you've got to wear pants.

1034
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,674
- What do you think these are?
- Those look like my best Levi's.

1035
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,710
- You been into my bag?
- No.

1036
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:41,441
Come on, take them off. Take off my
Levi's. Come on. Whose are they?

1037
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,949
- Are they mine?
- No, they're mine.

1038
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,951
Well, you look very cute in them,
as you well know.

1039
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,453
- Sure. Ravishing.
- What did you do?

1040
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,215
Corner that little peasant somewhere?

1041
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,654
Go on, I've got work to do.

1042
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,090
I don't know if I wanna...
Pushed around in my own place.

1043
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,389
Anyway, how do you expect
to win a race if you don't eat?

1044
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,499
I ain't running.

1045
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,432
Whitey!
Oh, come hither.

1046
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,475
Princess, you're an angel
from heaven.

1047
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,804
Looks like I'm marrying
the wrong woman.

1048
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,543
Isn't this a beauty? This nice,
brown, luscious roast chicken.

1049
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,980
Skeeter! Skeeter!

1050
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:19,121
Don't worry about Skeeter.
Princess wouldn't do that.

1051
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:20,550
She loves Skeeter.

1052
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,484
Skeeter's... Is he there?

1053
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,128
Well, we got peas,
mashed potatoes, chicken.

1054
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,662
- Where's the dessert?
- Dessert yet?

1055
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,096
I suppose you expected
a great big cake with no flour,

1056
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,929
- no baking powder, no eggs...
- Who needs those things?

1057
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:35,968
We bake a cake every night here
without them. Don't we, Whitey?

1058
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,935
Yeah, man, out of sunshine.

1059
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,506
Stand by.

1060
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:45,472
<i>Poing mi</i>
<i>Pleet-baa, pleet-baa, pleet-baa</i>

1061
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:51,784
<i>We ought to bake a sunshine cake</i>

1062
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:55,515
<i>Oh, we ought to bake</i>
<i>A sunshine cake</i>

1063
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,023
What's that?
What's a sunshine cake?

1064
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,956
<i>Why don't we get the stuff together</i>

1065
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:06,363
<i>And demonstrate</i>
<i>How to bake us up a sunshine cake</i>

1066
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:15,943
- <i>Mama</i>
- <i>We ought to bake a sunshine cake</i>

1067
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,944
<i>It does more good</i>
<i>Than a big, thick steak</i>

1068
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,550
<i>You start with</i>
<i>A tablespoon of trouble</i>

1069
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,720
- Then?
- <i>Then add a smile</i>

1070
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:29,153
- <i>And let it bubble up, up</i>
- Up?

1071
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,419
<i>Oh, we ought to bake a sunshine cake</i>

1072
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,359
<i>It really isn't so hard to make</i>

1073
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,465
- How?
- <i>Fresh tears</i>

1074
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,601
<i>A pound or two of pleasure</i>

1075
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,031
<i>Kind words</i>

1076
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:44,866
- <i>You needrt use a measure cup</i>
- So?

1077
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,670
- <i>Oh, it's not from a recipe book</i>
- Dinner.

1078
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:52,075
- <i>And you don't have to be a good cook</i>
- The chicken.

1079
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:55,809
<i>Or run to the oven and look</i>

1080
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,715
<i>With such a simple dish</i>
<i>All you do is wish</i>

1081
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,517
<i>So why not bake a sunshine cake</i>

1082
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,854
<i>Of course, it may keep</i>
<i>Your dreams awake</i>

1083
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:09,031
<i>Friends say</i>
<i>There's nothing like the flavor</i>

1084
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:12,565
- Really?
- <i>Don't wait to do your friends a favor</i>

1085
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,703
<i>And for goodness' sake</i>

1086
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,394
- <i>What are we waiting for?</i>
- <i>What are we waiting for?</i>

1087
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,973
<i>Let's bake a sunshine cake</i>

1088
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,278
Ladies and gentlemen.
Due to technical difficulties

1089
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:35,220
beyond our control, the program
originally scheduled for this time

1090
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,552
will now be heard.

1091
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:42,289
<i>Well, we've got the right ingredients</i>
<i>So let's proceed</i>

1092
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,468
<i>Cheerful disposition</i>
<i>That's all we need</i>

1093
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:49,627
<i>Bits of happy poetry</i>
<i>We need a lot</i>

1094
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:55,672
<i>Nothing</i>

1095
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:58,279
<i>Add a little dreaming</i>
<i>Of the cobweb type</i>

1096
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:01,507
<i>Put on your slippers</i>
<i>Then you light your pipe</i>

1097
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,243
<i>Then add a little feeling</i>
<i>Here's a measure cup</i>

1098
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,617
<i>And then you give it to the lady</i>
<i>Let her stir it up</i>

1099
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,348
- <i>Stir it up</i>
- <i>Stir it up</i>

1100
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,186
- <i>Stir it up</i>
- <i>No fuma</i>

1101
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:14,454
<i>Sí, sí, sí</i>
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da</i>

1102
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:17,360
- <i>Hey</i>
- <i>Hopa, hopa</i>

1103
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,400
- <i>Rumba</i>
- <i>Riba</i>

1104
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:24,232
<i>Yes, arumba, arumba</i>
<i>Hello, toowee bravo</i>

1105
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,606
<i>Enchilada</i>

1106
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,142
- <i>Low bridge</i>
- <i>Olé</i>

1107
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,836
- <i>Olé</i>
- <i>Look out, we're coming round you</i>

1108
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,949
<i>Nobody heard</i>
<i>Seňorita, be my guest</i>

1109
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:38,052
- <i>Sí, seňor</i>
- <i>? Cómo dice?</i>

1110
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,744
<i>Da, da, da, da, dum, dum</i>

1111
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,483
<i>Sí, sí, sí</i>
<i>Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, hey</i>

1112
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:49,587
- <i>It's got vitamins A</i>
- <i>Vitamins B</i>

1113
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,267
<i>Vitamins L-O-V-E</i>

1114
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,734
- <i>It's fine if you're fat</i>
- <i>Finer if you're thin</i>

1115
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,567
<i>What's wrong if you get</i>
<i>A double grin?</i>

1116
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:01,676
<i>Oh, you ought to bake</i>
<i>A sunshine cake</i>

1117
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:05,314
<i>Oh, she ought to bake</i>
<i>A sunshine cake</i>

1118
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,382
<i>I can't bake a sunshine cake</i>

1119
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:11,884
<i>You both better go</i>
<i>And jump in the lake</i>

1120
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,851
<i>Oh, for goodness' sake</i>

1121
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:18,323
<i>Why don't we check on the chicken</i>
<i>We can't live on a sunshine cake</i>

1122
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:20,996
<i>We ought to bake a sunshine cake</i>

1123
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:24,462
<i>Oh, we ought to bake a sunshine cake</i>

1124
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,966
<i>Oh, we ought to bake a sunshine cake</i>

1125
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:32,130
<i>Of course, it may keep</i>
<i>Your dreams awake</i>

1126
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:39,811
- <i>Don't wait to do your friends a favor</i>
- <i>Let's bake a sunshine cake</i>

1127
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:42,917
Alle, alle oxen free.

1128
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,781
<i>Of course, it may keep</i>
<i>Your dreams awake</i>

1129
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,616
- Hey.
- <i>Friends say</i>

1130
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,519
- Enzio.
- <i>There's nothing like the flavor</i>

1131
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:53,492
- <i>Don't wait to do your friends a favor</i>
- John Chuck.

1132
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,631
- Endoina.
- <i>And for goodness' sake, let's...</i>

1133
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,233
- Cake is done, son.
- Sure enough?

1134
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:02,165
It's souffléd and frappéd.

1135
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,340
- Dinner.
- Oh, what a beautiful sonata.

1136
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,406
The number one song
on the hit parade.

1137
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,100
Just bring that great big, brown,
beautiful bird over here.

1138
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:11,143
We'll take some and leave some,
but not much.

1139
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,278
- Oh, the rairs coming in.
- Oh, let it come in.

1140
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:19,978
I could eat this bird underwater.

1141
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,747
- Give me some equipment here.
- Right.

1142
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,220
- Give me a fork and a...
- Sir.

1143
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,519
A good, sharp knife.

1144
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,854
All right, the act's over.
That's all. It's been on.

1145
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,999
- Pretty happy tonight, aren't you?
- Oh, I ought to be happy.

1146
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,229
Tomorrow, we're gonna win
that $1,000 race.

1147
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,465
After that, we'll win the big one,
and we'll prove to Margaret that...

1148
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:43,009
<i>We ought to bake a sunshine cake</i>

1149
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,146
Mr. Brooks, the rairs coming in.

1150
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,909
All right, let it rain. I'm busy.
I'm working on this bird.

1151
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,915
You really want to win
that big race, don't you?

1152
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,747
Oh, honey, you'll never
know how much.

1153
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:55,049
I got to win that money
to breed horses.

1154
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,089
You will. I've got my fingers crossed.

1155
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:05,931
Mr. Brooks, the rairs
coming in, right over Bill.

1156
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:10,998
Whoa, Bill. Now, steady.
Whoa, Bill, whoa.

1157
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,701
Here, now, Bill. Steady. Let's get
the doors and the windows.

1158
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,574
- You get that big door there.
- Yes, sir.

1159
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,277
What about dinner?

1160
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:29,082
Come on, Bill. Here, boy. Here, Bill.
Come on, Bill. Here. Here, now.

1161
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:33,285
Here, boy. Here, here, here. Come on,
Bill. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, Bill. Here.

1162
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:37,860
Whoa. Hey, get me a dry blanket.
This thing is soaking wet.

1163
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,167
Come here, boy. Here. Whoa, boy.

1164
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,533
You'll be all right now.
You'll be all right. Steady. Whoa, Bill.

1165
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,772
It's raining right on top of him.

1166
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,940
Come on with that blanket!
Hurry up!

1167
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,546
Yeah, I'll fix that. Come find
a warm place to move him.

1168
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,149
Steady, Bill. Steady, Bill, old boy.

1169
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,512
- Ain't no such thing.
- No dry place?

1170
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,688
It looks like a punchboard.

1171
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:03,987
Whitey, you stay right with that
horse, now. Don't let him get excited.

1172
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,491
- Hum to him. Build a fire.
- Dan, can I help?

1173
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:09,392
No, you stay out of the way.
You'll get hurt.

1174
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,968
Bradshaw. Put Bradshaw on!

1175
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,966
- Yes, Mr. Whitehall?
- Hello, Bradshaw. How's Gallant Lady?

1176
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,406
It's beginning to rain pretty hard.
Make sure all the windows are shut.

1177
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,410
Don't let any drafts come in.
We don't want her catching any colds.

1178
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,550
And watch that thermostat!
Don't let it vary more than 2 degrees.

1179
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,685
Righto, I'll hop to it.

1180
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,650
Now, you blighters,
check all those windows.

1181
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,666
What are you doing up here?
Go on, get back down.

1182
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,768
Do you wanna get hurt?

1183
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,676
Whoa, boy.

1184
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:16,425
I don't think it's ever gonna let up.

1185
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,123
Here, give me one of those
mustard plasters, will you?

1186
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:20,563
- Hurry up.
- Here you are.

1187
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,362
Let me have them.

1188
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,005
Here, Bill.

1189
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:27,199
Here, Bill. Whoa, boy.

1190
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,378
How is he? Warm?

1191
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,548
No, he's still shivering. Get another
one ready, will you? Right away.

1192
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:38,118
Poor darling, you're not gonna
get sick on us, are you? Of course not.

1193
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:40,448
Here, boy.
Just keep him up on his feet.

1194
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,214
Don't let him get down,
or we're cooked.

1195
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,916
Whoa, baby. Whoa.

1196
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:48,188
It's pretty cold in here.
What time is it, Whitey?

1197
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,328
Four o'clock.

1198
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:54,431
Four o'clock?
I'll make you some coffee.

1199
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,434
You'll be all right.

1200
01:02:58,374 --> 01:02:59,602
Hey, big boy.

1201
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:15,355
- What now?
- I don't know.

1202
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,430
Well done, huh?

1203
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,734
Oh, you poor kid, you must be beat.

1204
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,270
You look worse than the chicken.

1205
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,712
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding, honey.

1206
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,413
Here, come on over here, where
you can stretch out and get some rest.

1207
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,646
- I'm sorry, Dan. I'll be all right.
- No, you must be beat.

1208
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,654
- You must be knocked out.
- I'm not sleepy!

1209
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,622
Get the coat off and lie down.

1210
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,558
You should be back in the hotel,
where you can keep warm,

1211
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,733
instead of over here trying to do
the work of five or six roustabouts.

1212
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,402
Sit down there
and give me your boots.

1213
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,233
Oh, you poor kid.

1214
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,907
You wanted to come
to the races, huh?

1215
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,140
My old sleeping bag. You'll be all right.

1216
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,473
We'll get you zipped up here,
and you'll be snug as a bug in a rug.

1217
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,277
- How that?
- That's fine.

1218
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,043
- That better?
- Thanks, Dan.

1219
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,049
You're a sweet kid, princess.

1220
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,848
No kidding.

1221
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:26,252
OK. Get some rest now.

1222
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,096
- Dan?
- Hey?

1223
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:33,702
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1224
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:38,596
Yeah. Sure.

1225
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,067
- Sick animal.
- It's pretty bad, huh?

1226
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:49,074
He's running a high fever.
I just gave him a shot of penicillin.

1227
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:52,372
But with a cold like that, it may be
some time before the horse runs.

1228
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:55,209
He looks so pathetic.

1229
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,517
Every two hours, give him these.

1230
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,917
Send the boy with me, and I'll send
you back some capsules.

1231
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,682
- OK.
- Save a lot of time.

1232
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:07,192
Say, doc, he's entered in the big race
Saturday. What am I gonna do?

1233
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:10,388
Saturday? Well, I don't know,
that's a week off.

1234
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,727
Horses are very funny. Sometimes
they snap out of it just like that.

1235
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,733
And sometimes...

1236
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:18,839
But don't work him until the fever
disappears, and he starts eating again.

1237
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,942
Even then, I wouldn't work him
too hard. Give his heart a chance.

1238
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,671
Rest him till the very
last minute. All right, Whitey.

1239
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,915
Come on, Bill. Come on.

1240
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,286
You're not gonna let Dan
down now, are you?

1241
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,724
You're not gonna let
a little cold stop you.

1242
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,332
Come on, try and get up.

1243
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,373
Well, do we or do we not
call this whole thing off?

1244
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,603
I don't want a fiasco happening around
here. They're hinting at it already.

1245
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,974
Father, don't you dare call anything off.
It's my wedding.

1246
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,743
I warned you, Margaret, you and
your hockey players and jockeys.

1247
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:05,477
And it's coming off
according to schedule,

1248
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,622
and neither you nor
any horse is going to stop it.

1249
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:11,315
Why don't you do something about it?
What's Alice doing down there?

1250
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,119
Oh, she took him down
a pet rooster or something.

1251
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,763
Rooster? Has she gone crazy too?

1252
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,559
I don't like it.
That's no place for her, the little imp.

1253
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:21,703
Oh, stop worrying about Alice.
She'll be back, and so will Dan.

1254
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:24,338
- Yes? Perhaps.
- That's what I came to see you about.

1255
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,667
I know the others have been talking
to you about the paper-box factory.

1256
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,537
Well, I can't hold his job
open indefinitely.

1257
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:31,042
You owe it to me to hold it open
for him. It was your fault he left.

1258
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:32,874
My fault the man
doesn't like paper boxes?

1259
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:34,310
You thought you could order
him around,

1260
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:35,882
the way you do Mary's husband,
and Mathilda's.

1261
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,645
He didn't wanna leave. He loves me.
You drove him away.

1262
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:40,116
We always get around to this,
don't we?

1263
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,550
Imagine the position
that you've put me in.

1264
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,317
People are saying I have a horse for
a rival, and the horse is winning out.

1265
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,394
Well, it's true, isn't it?
And you're not doing a thing to stop it.

1266
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,826
If that horse wins a race,
you'll never see Dan Brooks again.

1267
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:53,661
Oh, Father, be your age.
The day of miracles is over.

1268
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,734
I inquired about Broadway Bill.

1269
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:59,305
The man at the nightclub
said he was a pig.

1270
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:02,607
Pig?

1271
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:04,240
Yes?

1272
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:05,937
<i>A man by the name</i>
<i>of Butch calling, sir.</i>

1273
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:08,013
Butch?

1274
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,947
Oh, yes. Yes. Put him on.

1275
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:16,981
Hello, Mr. Butch?

1276
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,629
Are you prepared to accept
a wager on a pig...? A horse?

1277
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,027
Come on, let's get up.
Try. Come on, get up.

1278
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:27,669
Dars out there worrying. You don't
want Dan to worry over you, do you?

1279
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,930
Come on, Bill. Come on, try.

1280
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,507
Try to get up. We gotta
win that race Saturday, Bill.

1281
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:39,010
Come on, boy.
Come on, now, try real hard. Try.

1282
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:43,015
We're going up this time. Come on.
Here we go. This time, we get up.

1283
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,950
Come on. Come on. Come...
Come on, boy.

1284
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,852
Up you go. Dan, he's getting up!

1285
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:53,722
- Dan! Dan, he's up!
- Oh, you old goldbrick artist.

1286
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:57,660
You're gonna be all right. Come on,
get up on your toes. On your feet.

1287
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:00,335
Whitey! Whitey! Oh, Whitey!

1288
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:02,466
Whitey, bring us a carrot. Come on.

1289
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:06,163
Oh, I got some right here.
Here, Bill. Here.

1290
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:09,538
Look, he's eating. Oh, this horse has
got a heart as big as a grandstand.

1291
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,906
- He's gonna be OK.
- Think he'll be able to run on Saturday?

1292
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,342
Run? He'll dance!

1293
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,744
<i>A do-si-do and away we go! Do-si-do...</i>

1294
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,181
What are we doing dancing here?
We got work to do.

1295
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,117
- Come on, Bill. Come on, boy.
- But the vet said not to work him.

1296
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,052
Oh, he don't know this horse.
This is a different horse.

1297
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:27,161
Come on, Bill. You big sissy, you.
Come on, boy. Come, Bill. Here, Bill.

1298
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:31,356
Come on, you big, black...
Come on, boy.

1299
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:35,025
He's gonna run Saturday.
He's gonna win Saturday. Come on.

1300
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:38,001
Big old goldbrick, in there
goldbricking on me, werert you?

1301
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,641
You was goldbricking on me.
Yes, you was.

1302
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,368
- No, professor, I...
- Oh, I nearly forgot.

1303
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:47,174
- Compliments of vinegar-puss.
- Well, isn't this dandy? Fine.

1304
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,879
Oh, sinkers again. Don't you ever
have any meat over at your house?

1305
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:52,314
Meat? Meat? What's meat?

1306
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,852
Professor, I don't think
we can take a chance.

1307
01:09:54,056 --> 01:09:56,217
The vet told me not to dare
run this horse until Saturday.

1308
01:09:56,425 --> 01:10:00,293
So we gotta find some other way
to raise the $500. Are you with me?

1309
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,726
- To the bitter end, my friend.
- Now, I have a suggestion.

1310
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:05,298
Of course, it's likely to jar
your tender sensibilities,

1311
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:06,968
but suppose we go to work for it?

1312
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:09,433
Oh, my allergy.

1313
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:10,933
It's our only hope.

1314
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,007
There's a lot of ways you can pick up a
little quick scratch around a racing town.

1315
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,802
Why don't you go collect Happy
and see what you can do.

1316
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:19,503
Well, the shock will probably kill him,
and I feel slightly nauseous myself.

1317
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,774
Godspeed, professor. Whitey?

1318
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,212
- Yes, sir?
- You got any ideas?

1319
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:27,219
Oh, yes, sir.
My acrobats are ready to perform.

1320
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:29,391
- Can I help too?
- That's a handsome offer, honey,

1321
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,060
- but it's a mars job.
- Five hundred is a lot of money.

1322
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:35,094
I just let Whitey and the professor
in on it so they'd feel good.

1323
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:36,787
I could raise the whole
bundle myself.

1324
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:39,160
Matter of fact, I'm on my way now,
down to the bank where they know me.

1325
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:42,963
Open. Let's see. Boing. So long.

1326
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,866
I tell you, that dog was leading
all the way and got beat by that much.

1327
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,509
- Mr. Bagley?
- Yes, ma'am.

1328
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,702
- Did you see that last race?
- I wouldn't bet him with your dough.

1329
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,778
He hadrt had a horse out of...

1330
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,883
Say, bud, they still giving 15 bucks
a pint for this stuff?

1331
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,212
Where you been?
Twenty-five, as long as it's red.

1332
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,047
Oh, happy day.

1333
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:03,089
Well, they can drain me dry, boy.
I'm gonna leave here loaded.

1334
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:04,816
Hey? Who do you like in the fifth?

1335
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:07,052
Oh, I gotta pick up a fast 500.
I need a long shot.

1336
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,494
There's a thing in there called Fancy
Felice, gonna be about 30-for-1. Yeah.

1337
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,223
I'm betting my pint on her, boy.

1338
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:15,096
Well, it's your blood.

1339
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,235
- Fancy Felice.
- Mr. Brooks.

1340
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,000
Hit me with that happy needle.

1341
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:23,576
- Leave me enough to get home on.
- Roll your sleeve down.

1342
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,076
- What?
- Your blood count's rather low.

1343
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,680
You haven't been eating regularly,
have you?

1344
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:29,578
Oh, you must have got ahold of
a bad corpuscle or something, sister.

1345
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,013
- Here, try the other arm.
- Yeah, I know.

1346
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,916
We have a fund for fellows like you.
Go out and get yourself a good meal.

1347
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,647
- Mr. Shaugnessy?
- Here.

1348
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:37,086
I'm Dan Brooks.

1349
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,158
I own Broadway Bill.
He's gonna win the derby.

1350
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:42,387
Not if he hasn't been eating any better
than you have. Go in, Mr. Shaugnessy.

1351
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,396
- What's with you?
- Late scratch.

1352
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:47,831
I'm just a drip without a drop, I guess.

1353
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:51,973
Right at the captairs house.
Come on, dice.

1354
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,837
- Ten is the play.
- A dollar and six bits on ten.

1355
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:01,076
- Ten.
- Wait a minute.

1356
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,777
- Loaded.
- You double-crosser, you!

1357
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:12,291
- Hello.
- Yes?

1358
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,893
How do you hock something?

1359
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:21,229
First time, huh? Just put it
on the counter, lady. It's painless.

1360
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,740
At last we're back in action.
Pick a sucker.

1361
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,773
It would be difficult
to pick one who wasrt.

1362
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:31,411
Now, remember, all we make
goes to Broadway Bill.

1363
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:33,911
I don't care what it's for,
as long as we work.

1364
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,346
Maybe you'll get used
to the idea and like it.

1365
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,577
Oh, there he is.

1366
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:44,191
I never knew a fella could have so
much bad luck in one day, in all my life.

1367
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:48,159
I'm sure my wife will give me
the dickens for this.

1368
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:54,326
Our first victim,
and dripping with innocence.

1369
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,333
Beautiful. Go get him.

1370
01:12:56,538 --> 01:13:00,531
<i>Pick them and pluck them</i>
<i>Pick them and pluck them</i>

1371
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:07,577
If you had such bad luck
all the day long as I've had...

1372
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,546
I don't know what I'm gonna tell
the old woman.

1373
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,885
I beg your pardon, could I borrow
your pencil for a moment?

1374
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:14,953
Oh, sure.

1375
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,493
The ear.

1376
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:22,321
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

1377
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,934
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1378
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:31,334
<i>Doughboy, number three,</i>
<i>is 2 pounds overweight.</i>

1379
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,168
- Pardon me, sir, do you own horses?
- What was that?

1380
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:37,402
- Do you own horses?
- Well, naturally.

1381
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,475
- Thank you.
- Colonel Snodgrass.

1382
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:42,445
Colonel Snodgrass!
I've been looking all over for you.

1383
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,619
The big boss says for you
to scratch your horse.

1384
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,720
Scratch my horse?
What do you mean, scratch my horse?

1385
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,824
It's gonna be a boat race.
They got it all set for...

1386
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:55,754
- Oh, got him all set to win.
- He said to tell you and nobody else.

1387
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:57,989
Thank you, sonny boy.

1388
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,794
- Well, good day.
- Good... Pardon me, sir.

1389
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,834
- Couldrt let a fella in on it, could you?
- On what?

1390
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:05,529
On the name of the horse.
The one they've got all set to win.

1391
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,038
Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.

1392
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:10,211
Oh, I've had awfully bad luck.
I haven't had a winner all day.

1393
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:12,437
I'm sorry, my friend,
but these things are confidential.

1394
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:15,014
If too many people wager,
it brings the odds down.

1395
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,583
Oh, I won't bet too much,
just enough to kind of get even.

1396
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:21,882
- Sorry, stranger. Sorry.
- Oh, gee whiz.

1397
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,248
How would you like
the name of that horse?

1398
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,725
- How would I like it? Say, listen...
- OK, It'll cost you $25.

1399
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,830
- Twenty-five dollars!
- All right, forget it!

1400
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,522
Just a minute. Don't get excited.

1401
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:33,223
I'm taking a chance on losing my job,
ain't I?

1402
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,369
Yeah, but that's
an awful lot of money.

1403
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:36,936
Come on, make it snappy.
Somebody might see us.

1404
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,731
There you are.
Now, what's the name of the horse?

1405
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,340
- What?
- What's the name of the horse?

1406
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:41,770
- Doughboy.
- Doughboy!

1407
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,344
- Don't go spreading it around.
- Oh, you can trust me. I never talk.

1408
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:50,348
Doughboy. Doughboy.
Doughboy. Doughboy. Doughboy.

1409
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:52,782
Doughboy. I just got word
right from the stables.

1410
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:56,954
Can't lose. Doughboy!
Bet all you got on Doughboy.

1411
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:01,027
Doughboy. It's in the bag. It's all fixed.
They're gonna hit Doughboy.

1412
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:04,165
Hock the family jewels
and bet it on Doughboy.

1413
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,334
Give me a 150 bucks on Doughboy.

1414
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,366
All the money my wife's
got in the world.

1415
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,902
- How much will you give for this suit?
- Can't use it.

1416
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:13,564
- Here, I milked him for 25.
- Excellent.

1417
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:16,767
You know, it grieves me to see
the gullibility of the human race.

1418
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,379
- What fleabag did you give him?
- Doughboy.

1419
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:23,347
Doughboy. Why, Doughboy
hasn't the ghost of a chance.

1420
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:26,544
- OK. Pick another sucker.
- Oh, a pleasure.

1421
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:29,485
<i>Pick them and pluck them</i>
<i>Pick them and pluck them</i>

1422
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:34,024
I beg your pardon, but could I
borrow your pencil for a moment?

1423
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:37,824
Oh, I'll mark your program, sir.
Number three. Doughboy.

1424
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:40,900
Can't lose, can't lose.

1425
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:45,630
I got the lowdown
on the next race: Doughboy.

1426
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:49,136
Doughboy on the schnoz.
He can't miss.

1427
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:52,404
I just come from the stable.
Get down on him. Doughboy.

1428
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:54,844
Doughboy will walk in.

1429
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,416
The smart money's on Doughboy.

1430
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:58,881
Doughboy's hot.

1431
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:02,887
- Doughboy. Doughboy.
- Doughboy. Doughboy.

1432
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,822
Twenty-five!

1433
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:14,366
Twenty-five! Twenty-five!

1434
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,265
Twenty-five!

1435
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:20,267
Twenty-five dollars on Doughboy!

1436
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:26,006
<i>There they go!</i>

1437
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,146
Doughboy. Doughboy.

1438
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,284
Doughboy.
Dough... Dough...

1439
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,857
Where's Doughboy?

1440
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,491
Bilked by my own chicanery.

1441
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,903
I beg your pardon.

1442
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,369
- Watch yourself. Watch yourself.
- Doughboy!

1443
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:55,907
- Coming through.
- Doughboy!

1444
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,238
Doughboy!

1445
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,745
Doughboy!

1446
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:06,081
- Whitey?
- Yes, miss.

1447
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,051
Come here.

1448
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,755
That's what you get
for using loaded dice.

1449
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:13,928
- It was for a noble cause.
- Yes, I know. It's a mars job.

1450
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,565
Well, today is ladies' day.
Here's $120.

1451
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:19,893
You won that shooting craps,
you understand?

1452
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:22,263
- I did?
- Yes. There'll be more tomorrow.

1453
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,372
If you tell Mr. Brooks where that
came from, I'll fix your other eye.

1454
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,769
I bet you would at that.

1455
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,500
- Miss Alice?
- Yes?

1456
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:31,939
I'm pulling for you.

1457
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,514
Thanks, Whitey.

1458
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:39,676
<i>Men say there's nothing like the flavor</i>

1459
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:42,982
<i>Don't wait to do your friends a favor</i>

1460
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:45,625
<i>And for goodness' sake</i>

1461
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:50,855
<i>Let's bake a sunshine cake</i>

1462
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,632
460, 470, 480...

1463
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,804
I've never seen Alexander Hamilton
look so well.

1464
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,998
480, 485, 490, 495.

1465
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,973
- What comes after 495?
- Five hundred!

1466
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,306
You are right, my friend.
And $10 to celebrate on.

1467
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,574
Let me run through that
with my bare fingers.

1468
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,615
To think that this vast fortune
was accumulated

1469
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,652
with just the clever employment
of two little squares of ivory.

1470
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:17,018
A toast to Whitey,
whose hand is quicker than his eye.

1471
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:18,852
- To Whitey!
- Whitey.

1472
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,522
My dear professor, even though your
share in this was as nebulous as mine,

1473
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,666
your story about Doughboy
was so touching, we forgive you.

1474
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,928
The first time I ever saw a guy
sucked in by his own gag.

1475
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,073
- I was a victim of mass hypnosis.
- Yes, I'll say you were.

1476
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:36,574
And to you, princess,
for your moral support, a kiss.

1477
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,906
And now to the secretary's office
to deposit the $500 entry fee.

1478
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,743
That done, we shall repair to the village,
where there shall be merrymaking,

1479
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:45,647
dancing in the streets and carousing
in the cool of the evening.

1480
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:47,253
- Get your coat, honey.
- Oh, I don't need it.

1481
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,947
I've got your kiss to keep me warm.

1482
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:51,553
Get a hen and join us.

1483
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,320
<i>We ought to bake us a sunshine cake</i>

1484
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,054
<i>It does more good</i>
<i>Than a big, thick steak</i>

1485
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,428
- <i>Start with a tablespoon of trouble</i>
- Doughboy.

1486
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:02,070
<i>Then add a smile and let it bubble</i>

1487
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,434
<i>Then add a smile and let it bubble</i>

1488
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:55,914
<i>The owner told Clarence the clocker</i>

1489
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:59,560
<i>The clocker told Jockey McGee</i>

1490
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:02,855
<i>The jockey, of course</i>
<i>Passed it on to the horse</i>

1491
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:07,398
<i>And the horse told me</i>

1492
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:13,935
<i>If it's muddy or wet</i>
<i>Take the size of your bet</i>

1493
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:17,168
<i>Divide by the size of the shoes</i>

1494
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:21,179
<i>Add the age</i>
<i>Multiplied by the length of the stride</i>

1495
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:24,750
<i>Providing you win</i>
<i>You can't lose</i>

1496
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:43,395
<i>The owner told Clarence the clocker</i>

1497
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:46,836
<i>The clocker told Jockey McGee</i>

1498
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:50,034
<i>The jockey, of course</i>
<i>Passed it on to the horse</i>

1499
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:54,011
<i>And the horse told me</i>

1500
01:20:58,453 --> 01:21:02,150
<i>Now, it was sunny and warm</i>
<i>And according to form</i>

1501
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:05,019
<i>No nag could get near Maryjane</i>

1502
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:09,288
<i>Well, now, when the weather is dry</i>
<i>She can take off and fly</i>

1503
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:13,160
<i>So I bet</i>
<i>And it started to rain</i>

1504
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:21,766
Oh, shut up, will you?

1505
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:27,180
<i>The owner told Clarence the clocker</i>

1506
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:30,476
<i>The clocker told Jockey McGee</i>

1507
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:33,552
<i>The jockey, of course</i>
<i>Passed it on to the horse</i>

1508
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:37,247
<i>And the horse told me</i>

1509
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:38,892
- Hey, No-Blood.
- Hello, pal.

1510
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:41,585
- Here's a new one.
- What?

1511
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:45,197
<i>Tell the age of the beast</i>
<i>By his teeth and at least</i>

1512
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,164
<i>His teeth in the paddock looked great</i>

1513
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:51,567
<i>But the toothy old wretch</i>
<i>Stopped to sneeze in the stretch</i>

1514
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,105
<i>But he won by a lost upper plate</i>

1515
01:21:57,112 --> 01:22:01,014
<i>The owner told Clarence the clocker</i>

1516
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:04,242
<i>The clocker told Jockey McGee</i>

1517
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:07,387
<i>The jockey, of course,</i>
<i>Passed it on to the horse</i>

1518
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:10,786
<i>And the horse told me</i>

1519
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,358
Hey, I got one, wait for me.
Don't rush. No, I got one.

1520
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:15,927
Hello, Shorts. What've you got?

1521
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:19,396
<i>I had 20 across</i>
<i>With no chance for a loss</i>

1522
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,468
- <i>I even hocked all of my clothes</i>
- You fool.

1523
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:25,765
<i>But the horse threw a shoe</i>
<i>Had bellyache too</i>

1524
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:29,307
<i>Now I'm down</i>
<i>To my buttons and bows.</i>

1525
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:38,987
<i>The owner told Clarence the clocker</i>

1526
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:41,683
<i>The owner told Clarence the clocker</i>

1527
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,155
<i>The clocker told Jockey McGee</i>

1528
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,954
<i>The jockey, of course</i>
<i>Passed it on to the horse</i>

1529
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:51,496
<i>And the horse told me</i>

1530
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,605
- Dan, what if you lose tomorrow?
- Oh, Margaret used to love that song.

1531
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:07,141
<i>But, darling, I'd say we've got</i>
<i>A sure thing this time</i>

1532
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:13,447
<i>I'd say that we're on our way to a star</i>

1533
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,283
<i>And you can take a tip from me</i>

1534
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:20,222
<i>We are</i>
<i>We are</i>

1535
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:23,761
<i>And I won't...</i>

1536
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:27,924
Where's Bill? Hey. Hey.

1537
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:33,239
Bill? Bill! Bill!

1538
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:38,171
- Whitey!
- Mr. Brooks! Mr. Brooks!

1539
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,678
Where's the horse? Where's Bill?
He's not in his stall.

1540
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:42,110
- Where is he?
- They took him away.

1541
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,614
- Who?
- Mr. Jones, the feed man.

1542
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,376
- He came here with the sheriff.
- The sheriff?

1543
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:47,316
- Yes, sir, and took him off.
- Why didn't you stop them?

1544
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:49,888
I tried, but they had papers.
They put a rope around his neck

1545
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,490
- A rope?
- And tied him to an automobile

1546
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,058
- and dragged him off.
- Which way did they go?

1547
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,388
I chased them for half a mile,
but it didn't do no good.

1548
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:58,862
Dan! Dan, wait! Wait!

1549
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:01,861
Get in that stall!

1550
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:05,662
- Get in there, or I'II...
- What are you doing to that horse?

1551
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,774
Why, you dirty...

1552
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:13,678
- Hey, what's going on?
- What's going on here?

1553
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,942
- Come on, let go. Break it up.
- Take it easy, now.

1554
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,380
- Let go of me!
- Take it easy.

1555
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:21,521
That rat was whipping my horse!
He was beating my horse!

1556
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,688
Cool off and have a nice sleep.

1557
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,690
Don't you worry about me,
you better take care of my horse.

1558
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,157
I'll go right out and cut him some hay.

1559
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,331
That's Broadway Bill,
he's in the Imperial Derby tomorrow.

1560
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,329
He'll look funny carrying the judge
across the finish line.

1561
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:35,765
He'll carry the judge, jury, the clerk of
the court and bailiff and win that heat.

1562
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:37,596
- What's eating him?
- Search me.

1563
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:40,138
Somebody attacks his nag,
and he's blowing his top.

1564
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,808
What's the matter, operator?
I wanna get Pittsburgh.

1565
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:52,453
If Detroit can't handle any more, OK.
What price? OK, 2,000 on Sun Up.

1566
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:54,747
Denver, 2,200. Frisco, 1,800.
New Orleans, 3,000.

1567
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:57,049
- Dallas, 12. New York, 9,000.
- What's the total? What's the total?

1568
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,249
- Close to 40,000.
- Why, we haven't even started yet.

1569
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:00,985
- What's the average?
- About 7-to-1.

1570
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:04,461
7-to-1? Listen, Sully, I'm gonna
shoot the works on that horse of yours.

1571
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,930
I hope we're not pulling a boner.
You're sure he's all right?

1572
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:09,330
- Sun Up? If it wasrt for Gallant Lady...
- Forget Gallant Lady.

1573
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:10,799
- He's a cinch to beat all the others.
- OK.

1574
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:12,770
All right, folks,
get your bets down, please.

1575
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,737
Don't get shut out.
The big race of the day.

1576
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,342
Any bets on Broadway Bill?

1577
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:18,512
Not one. They're laying off
of that plug like poison.

1578
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,840
- Ten dollars on Sun Up to win.
- Better make him 100-to-1.

1579
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:22,516
- Might pick up some sucker money.
- OK.

1580
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:24,150
Make Broadway Bill 100-to-1.

1581
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:27,651
All right, folks,
Broadway Bill is 100-to-1.

1582
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:31,420
A 100-to-1 shot.

1583
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,595
Broadway Bill, you old rascal.

1584
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,229
Where have you been all my life?

1585
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:38,092
Horses again.
You'd think they were men.

1586
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,233
Here's where I give
that bookie heart failure.

1587
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,801
He's going to buy my fall outfit
and doesn't know it.

1588
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,835
Number 28.
That's you again, Mae.

1589
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:48,566
Oh, it would be. That old moneybags
in 28 is going to drive me...

1590
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,471
Why, Mae, you ought to be thrilled.

1591
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,306
J.P. Chase is the richest man
in the world.

1592
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:57,549
Confound it, where is everybody?
Nurse? Nurse!

1593
01:25:57,752 --> 01:26:01,381
- Now, now, what's all the excitement?
- I've gotta get out of here.

1594
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:04,080
- You're a big boy now.
- Well, I tell you, I've got to get out of...

1595
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,920
- Oh, no, now, not another needle.
- Not this time, cutie.

1596
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:10,154
Where's that idiot of a doctor?
I'm going crazy in here.

1597
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,230
Now, take it easy.
You've got a broken leg.

1598
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,594
Broken leg. I've got a broken back
from lying here,

1599
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:16,793
- reading this cheap trash.
- Relax.

1600
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,336
I've got a business to attend to,
young woman.

1601
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:21,134
Relax. So you didn't make
another million in the market today.

1602
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:24,106
Oh, is that so?
Well, tell me something, smarty.

1603
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,246
How do you pass
your time in this prison?

1604
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:27,675
Oh, I flirt with the angels.

1605
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:29,372
- You what?
- Bet on horses.

1606
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,984
You bet on horses?
That keep your mind occupied?

1607
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:36,556
Brother, it keeps my mind occupied,
my blood boiling and my purse empty.

1608
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:38,487
Well, what horse
are you betting on today?

1609
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:41,890
- Broadway Bill.
- Broadway Bill? Why?

1610
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:45,463
It's 100-to-1. That's reason enough.
And I'm going to win one someday.

1611
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,931
100-to-1?
How much money are you betting?

1612
01:26:48,136 --> 01:26:49,626
- Two smackers.
- Two what?

1613
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:53,034
Two smackers. Dollars. Those things
you get nightmares about.

1614
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:57,405
Oh, all right. Well, you can
bet 2 smackers for me.

1615
01:26:57,612 --> 01:27:00,706
- You?
- Well, why not, huh?

1616
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:03,850
Give me something to think about.
One. Two. There.

1617
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,020
- Boy, is this funny.
- What's funny?

1618
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,247
You, the richest man in the world,
betting 2 bucks on a nag.

1619
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:11,857
- Are you sure you can spare it?
- Go on. You get out of here.

1620
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,927
Just put that 2 bucks on that
Buffalo Bill or whatever his name is.

1621
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:16,858
This is going to rock Wall Street.

1622
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,863
Just a minute, young lady.
How will I know we've won?

1623
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:23,462
You'll know. I'll come in
and dance a hula for you.

1624
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:26,538
Well, that's something.

1625
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:29,803
Steve, you want to hear
something funny?

1626
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:32,673
J.P. Chase just bet 2 whole dollars
on Broadway Bill.

1627
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,110
Oh, really? That's very funny.

1628
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:40,344
Hey, Rosie, get this. Old J.P. Chase
just bet 2 C's on Broadway Bill.

1629
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:43,020
Broadway Bill?

1630
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:48,889
Broadway Bill? Hey, J.P. Chase
just bet 2 G's on Broadway Bill!

1631
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,928
J.P. Chase? What do
you know about that?

1632
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:53,794
- Boy, that's good enough for me.
- Give me that phone.

1633
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,936
Yeah, 20,000 bucks.
Can you imagine that?

1634
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:58,731
J.P. Chase don't chuck it down
like that unless he knows something.

1635
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:02,137
- Must be hot. He bet 50,000 smackers.
- A hundred thousand? You're kidding.

1636
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,334
I just got it from the inside.
Two hundred grand.

1637
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:05,773
On Broadway Bill?

1638
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,005
Cross my heart. He said something
like a quarter of a million.

1639
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:10,446
Wow! On a 100-to-1 shot too.

1640
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:13,050
Two bucks on Broadway Bill,
on the nose.

1641
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:14,812
Two hundred dollars to win
on Broadway Bill.

1642
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,991
Give me $2 to win on
Broadway Bill for me,

1643
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:19,091
$2 for my brother,
and $2 for my wife.

1644
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,522
I got a telegram on him.

1645
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:22,423
You ought to get a bet on him yourself.
He's gonna win!

1646
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:24,655
It scared me to death.
I thought it was my mother.

1647
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:28,267
Who? Broadway Bill
hasn't got a chance.

1648
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:31,404
What do I care what a bunch of yokels
are doing? Let them bet their heads off.

1649
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:33,506
The more they do,
the better I'm gonna like it.

1650
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:34,936
Look what they're doing for us.

1651
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,804
They sent the price of Sun Up
from 4-to-1 up to 12-to-1.

1652
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:40,811
Boss, we've got one less horse to beat.
Broadway Bill's going to be scratched.

1653
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,482
What do you mean, "scratched"?

1654
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:45,278
- I didn't make this up, I just heard it.
- Well, what happened?

1655
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:46,748
I thought I was bringing you
some good news.

1656
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:48,182
All right, come on, what happened?

1657
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:50,857
I don't know. The guy that owns him
got himself in a jam. He's in jail.

1658
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,924
In jail?
With Broadway Bill out of the race,

1659
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:55,823
the odds on Sun Up will go
right back to 4-to-1.

1660
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,430
Listen, I've got to get ahold
of that guy. What's his name?

1661
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:00,863
- Brooks. Dan Brooks.
- Brooks. Dan Brooks, that's right.

1662
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,037
He's got to put Broadway Bill
back in the race.

1663
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,671
Now, you fellows don't lay
any bets till I get back.

1664
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,933
Company.

1665
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:11,770
- Hello, Dan.
- Hello, Mr. Howard.

1666
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:14,243
What's this little delegation here?

1667
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:18,277
You fellows didn't bring
a loaf of bread with a file in it, did you?

1668
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:20,613
I'd ask you in, only the door
seems to be stuck.

1669
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:22,847
- What happened?
- Well, along about the third round,

1670
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:25,787
I found out the guy I was messing with
was wearing a badge, so here I am.

1671
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:27,620
It isn't bad, though.
It keeps me out of the pool hall.

1672
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:29,763
What's the idea,
scratching that horse of yours?

1673
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:31,829
It's a long, dull story.
Something about a feed bill.

1674
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,661
You've got me in a mess. I've got a lot
of dough bet on that horse of yours.

1675
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,097
- You have?
- Sure.

1676
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:37,532
- Did you see him work?
- Oh, sure, sure.

1677
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:38,967
You know, I had that horse
go a mile in...

1678
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:41,573
Why don't you tell a guy when you're in
a jam? How much are you in hock for?

1679
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:44,176
- Oh, about 200, I guess.
- Why, that's chicken feed.

1680
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,574
Never keep a secret
like that from a pal.

1681
01:29:46,781 --> 01:29:48,009
- Here.
- What's this?

1682
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:49,877
Go ahead, you want the horse
back in the race, don't you?

1683
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:52,484
- Well, yeah.
- Well, so do I.

1684
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,079
You're not the old man
with the whiskers, are you?

1685
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:57,484
Never mind, I'm just grateful.
I'll pay you back soon as I can.

1686
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,819
Forget it. I'll get paid back plenty
when that horse breezes in.

1687
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,461
- He'll breeze in. Don't worry about that.
- You got a jockey?

1688
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:04,460
Well, I was talking to this little boy,
Eddie Jacobs.

1689
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:06,428
He's an apprentice.
How about Ted Williams?

1690
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,124
Ted Williams? Can you get him?

1691
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:10,827
Can I get him? He'll do
anything for me. We're like that.

1692
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,563
With Williams aboard, it's just bring
a buck and a truck, and we're home.

1693
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:16,175
Go on down to the captain.
Pay his fine. Get him out of here.

1694
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:18,004
Put up a bond, whatever they want,
but get him out fast.

1695
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:19,440
- OK, boss.
- Now, you're all clear.

1696
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:22,548
I don't know how to thank you.
If you were free, I'd marry you.

1697
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,479
Don't you worry,
I'll make plenty on that race.

1698
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:26,619
I'll have Williams come up
and see you right away. So long, Dan.

1699
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:28,049
- Oh, say, Eddie.
- Yeah?

1700
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,622
Where will we go on
our honeymoon? Hey, guard.

1701
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:34,090
Hey, princess, Whitey.
Teddy Williams, the rider.

1702
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,923
- Oh, hello.
- How do you do, Mr. Williams?

1703
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:38,633
- How do you do?
- Bill, this is D-day for you.

1704
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:39,395
- How do you do?
- Bill, this is D-day for you.

1705
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,058
And here's the boy that's gonna
ride you to glory. Ted Williams, Bill.

1706
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,136
- He looks sharp.
- He's fit and ready to run.

1707
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:48,433
I blew him out of the gate this morning.
Three-eighths of a mile in 35 flat.

1708
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:50,668
- Thirty-five?
- Crying to run all the way.

1709
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,743
How is he in the gate?
I hear he threw his last jock.

1710
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:55,074
Oh, he's OK now.
That was only his first out, kid.

1711
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,513
- Has he got a hard mouth?
- Cast iron. Don't try to hold him.

1712
01:30:57,718 --> 01:30:58,946
He doesn't like to be held.

1713
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:02,247
You just hang on, Mr. Williams.
Old Bill will do the rest.

1714
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,947
I guess I'm just going along
for the ride.

1715
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:06,786
And ten percent of the purse. Well,
you better get over to the jocks' room.

1716
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,256
Be prepared to have
your picture taken, son,

1717
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,828
because you're gonna be
in the winner's circle.

1718
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,760
Whitey, looks like the old man
with the whiskers

1719
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,025
- has really got his arms around us?
- Yes, sir.

1720
01:31:14,235 --> 01:31:15,793
Bill, I've got a little bit
of a shock for you.

1721
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:18,301
Havert got the truck to take
you to the race track today.

1722
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:20,736
Old Bill, he'll walk just like
the rest of us poor people.

1723
01:31:20,942 --> 01:31:22,170
I guess so.

1724
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:23,741
<i>Take your places</i>
<i>Off to the races</i>

1725
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:26,470
<i>We don't give a rap</i>
<i>And we're off to the handicap</i>

1726
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:41,550
Yeah, this joint's full of smoke.
Don't nobody ever inale?

1727
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:43,923
Doc, will you move over
with that pipe, Hempstead?

1728
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:45,894
You're killing me with that pipe.

1729
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,965
What are you smoking, overhalls?

1730
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,733
<i>The Camptown ladies sing this song</i>

1731
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:56,876
<i>A doo-dah, a doo-dah</i>

1732
01:31:57,078 --> 01:31:59,478
<i>The Camptown race track</i>
<i>Nine miles long</i>

1733
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,045
<i>Oh, doo-dah day</i>

1734
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:03,547
<i>I came down there</i>
<i>With my hat caved in</i>

1735
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:05,719
- <i>Doo-dah, a doo-dah</i>
- <i>A doo-dah, doo-dah</i>

1736
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,979
<i>Go back home</i>
<i>With a pocket full of tin</i>

1737
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:10,248
<i>Oh, doo-dah day</i>

1738
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,619

01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,955
<i>I'll bet my money</i>
<i>On the bobtailed nag</i>

1741
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:19,064
<i>Somebody bet on the bay</i>

1742
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,428
<i>The long-tailed filly</i>
<i>And the big, black horse</i>

1743
01:32:21,636 --> 01:32:23,126
- <i>A doo-dah, a doo-dah</i>
- <i>A doo-dah, a doo-dah</i>

1744
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:24,736

- <i>A doo-dah, a doo-dah</i>

1745
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:27,999
<i>They both cut across</i>
<i>Oh, doo-dah day</i>

1746
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:30,268
<i>The blind horse sticking</i>
<i>In the big mud hole</i>

1747
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,639
- <i>A doo-dah, a doo-dah, a doo-dah</i>
- <i>A doo-dah, a doo-dah, a doo-dah</i>

1748
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:35,315
<i>You can't touch the bottom</i>
<i>With a 10-foot pole</i>

1749

- <i>Gwine to run all night</i>

- <i>Gwine to run all day</i>
- <i>Gwine to run all day</i>

1752
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,824
<i>Bet your money</i>
<i>On the bobtailed nag</i>

1753
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:46,186
<i>Somebody bet on the bay</i>

1754
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,191
<i>Watch old Bill in the first furlong</i>

- <i>Doo-dah, doo-dah</i>

01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:52,429
<i>Bet him to win</i>

1757
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:54,692

- <i>Oh, doo-dah day</i>

1758
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:56,961
<i>I'll bet my money</i>

- <i>Doo-dah, doo-dah</i>

1760
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,174
<i>We'll win enough money</i>
<i>To pay the feed man</i>

1761
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:02,603

- <i>No change?</i>

1762
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:05,142

01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:07,371
- <i>Gwine to run all night</i>
- <i>Gwine to run</i>

1764
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:08,981
- <i>Gwine to run all day</i>
- <i>All night, all day</i>

1765
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:10,878
<i>I'll bet on the bobtailed nag</i>

1766
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:14,054
<i>Oh, doo-dah day</i>

1767
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:18,021
- <i>Oh, doo-dah day</i>
- <i>Oh, doo-dah day</i>

1768
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:21,323
That mob down there's gone crazy.

1769
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:23,360
You know what Broadway Bill
is at the track? 6-to-1.

1770
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:25,088
- What are you worrying about?
- Now, listen, Eddie,

1771
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:27,426
there's a lot of dough going down on
that horse. Where's it coming from?

1772
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:30,035
A plug like Broadway Bill doesn't get
a play like that unless something's up.

1773
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:31,499
Somebody knows something,
I tell you.

1774
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:33,435
Maybe it's the Greek.
Maybe he's trying to pull a fast one.

1775
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:35,768
- You're screwy. The Greek's in with us.
- Then where is it coming from?

1776
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:38,639
Use your brain, maybe you'd find out.
Did you ever try to figure it out?

1777
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:41,314
Every bet that's being placed on
Broadway Bill is a 2-buck bet.

1778
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:43,813
Two bucks. Does that sound like
wise money to you?

1779
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,986
It starts out 50-to-1,
meat for the sucker.

1780
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:48,815
Every barber, bootblack and
chambermaid scrambles to get aboard.

1781
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,650
The rumor gets started,
the first thing you know,

1782
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:52,758
all the poor boobs are trying
to hock their undershirts.

1783
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,427
I've seen it happen a million times.

1784
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,221
It's sucker money, that's what it is.
Sucker money.

1785
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:57,658
Well, I still don't like it.

1786
01:33:57,865 --> 01:34:00,197
Maybe you'd be happier if you knew that
Ted Williams was riding Broadway Bill.

1787
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:02,164
- He is?
- Yeah, Williams on Broadway Bill,

1788
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:04,167
and Roberts on Gallant Lady.
Now are you happy?

1789
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,964
- Sun Up is 20-to-1 in Chicago.
- What did I tell you?

1790
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:07,902
- How much will they handle?
- How much will you handle?

1791
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:09,337
- Fifteen thousand?
- OK.

1792
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:10,976
- New York, 20-to-1.
- How much can they handle?

1793
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:12,770
How much can you handle?
About 20.

1794
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:16,416
OK. Chicago, 15 grand.
New York, 20 grand.

1795
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:18,849
You want the race run honestly,
don't you?

1796
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:21,521
Naturally, but I don't like
this implication that my jockey...

1797
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:23,883
Listen, Mr. Whitehall,
we spend a fortune every year

1798
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:28,118
maintaining our Protective Bureau.
Why? To try to keep racing honest.

1799
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,921
If we can't have it that way,
we'll close the track up.

1800
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:32,929
Yes, I know, but what makes you think
that my boy is involved?

1801
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:35,398
I had Howard trailed,
and I had his men trailed.

1802
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:38,094
I was determined to find out
just what he had up his sleeve,

1803
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:41,638
and I found out, Mr. Whitehall.
Your jockey, Roberts.

1804
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:45,007
Well, that's the works.
How much have we got down?

1805
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:47,442
A hundred and one thousand,
average 12-to-1.

1806
01:34:47,648 --> 01:34:50,242
Over a million bucks.
It's the one we've been waiting for.

1807
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:53,345
Hey, boss, did you hear
what happened?

1808
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:57,012
Joey Roberts has been suspended.
He ain't gonna ride Gallant Lady.

1809
01:34:57,224 --> 01:34:58,851
- How did you find that out?
- I saw it on the bulletin.

1810
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,187
They got Bobby North aboard.

1811
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:03,829
Somebody smelled a rat.
This is a mess. Come on.

1812
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,556
I knew this was too good to be true.

1813
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:09,030
<i>The horses are now in the paddock.</i>

1814
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:28,482
I'm only interested in one horse.
Sun Up, number five.

1815
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:30,418
Beat him and you win this race.

1816
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:32,216
You're up against some
tough customers.

1817
01:35:32,426 --> 01:35:34,189
That jockey on Sun Up
might try anything.

1818
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:37,125
Don't let him get away with it.
Gallant Lady must win this race.

1819
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:40,266
Now, there's only one horse
you've got to beat. It's Gallant Lady.

1820
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:42,561
But you've got to beat her.
I don't care how.

1821
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:44,328
You've ridden lots of races and won.

1822
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:47,132
If you win this, there's a 5 G bonus
for you, if you do.

1823
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:51,008
Use your head or anything else
that's necessary,

1824
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,009
but you've got to beat Gallant Lady.
Understand?

1825
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,680
Listen, son. Bill don't like to run in
behind horses. See?

1826
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:58,443
If you get boxed or pocketed,
take him back and go around.

1827
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:00,677
Don't worry if you lose a little ground.
He'll make it up for you.

1828
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:03,550
There's one thing, though.
You've got to remember this one thing.

1829
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,248
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah, sure.

1830
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:07,120
This is a free-running horse, see.
Don't hold him back.

1831
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:10,525
Give him his head.
Give him his head, or he'll go crazy.

1832
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:12,665
I got to win this race, son.
I got to.

1833
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:15,768
I don't want to give you the house-and-
mortgage or the sick-mother routine,

1834
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:17,938
but my whole future depends on it.

1835
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:19,834
I can't explain, but that's it.

1836
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,233
- Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you.

1837
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:24,638
Jockeys up.

1838
01:36:27,815 --> 01:36:29,806
Now, remember, it's up to you.

1839
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:33,077
If you're smart, you'll cop this race.
Remember, it's up to you.

1840
01:36:33,387 --> 01:36:36,151
Well, Bill, it's up to you, boy.

1841
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:40,357
Must be nervous.
What are you shaking for?

1842
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:41,789
Who's shaking?

1843
01:36:49,336 --> 01:36:52,328
Come on, Skeeter,
let's go see a good race. Come on.

1844
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:10,212
<i>The horses are on the track.</i>

1845
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:12,156
Here he comes.

1846
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,833
- Dan.
- Well, it won't be long now.

1847
01:37:21,035 --> 01:37:23,560
Dan, Dan, I stand
at the crossroads of destiny.

1848
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:25,500
If we don't win,
it's goodbye, professor.

1849
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:27,970
- Why, what's the matter?
- I got 50 from Edna this morning,

1850
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:31,110
but I had to promise to marry her
if Broadway Bill loses.

1851
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:32,836
Well, a fellow can always
change his mind.

1852
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:35,345
Not with vinegar-puss.
She made him put it in writing.

1853
01:37:35,549 --> 01:37:38,848
Confidentially, Dan, it can't be done.
I'm slightly married already.

1854
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:41,747
- Well, who to?
- To another vinegar-puss in Latonia.

1855
01:37:41,956 --> 01:37:43,184
In a moment of carelessness.

1856
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:45,290
He thought he had a sure thing
that time too,

1857
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:47,187
but the horse forgot
what he came for.

1858
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:50,921
Dan, on my bended knees,
win this race.

1859
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:53,258
- All right, professor.
- So long, fella. Good luck.

1860
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:54,934
But your horse just don't figure.

1861
01:37:55,135 --> 01:37:58,832
Any guy that puts his dough on him
just naturally believes in fairies.

1862
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,529
Come on, Stupe.

1863
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:03,172
Don't pay any attention to him, Dan.

1864
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,777
- Good luck.
- Thanks, princess.

1865
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:09,106
If Happy's right, I'm on my way
to Higginsville in the morning, huh?

1866
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:11,307
Don't even think about it.
You'll win.

1867
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:13,247
Thanks, princess.

1868
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:15,418
Hey.

1869
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:18,018
You're not supposed to cry
till after the race. Come on, here.

1870
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,125
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1871
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:21,885
Good luck.

1872
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:26,592
Now, now, go watch the race. Go on.

1873
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:32,305
I wish I knew how this thing
was going to end.

1874
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:40,741
That Broadway Bill looks all right.
What's Doc Poole worried about?

1875
01:38:42,116 --> 01:38:44,141
- I don't think he was ever sick.
- He looks all right today.

1876
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:55,356
Come right on in, miss.

1877
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:57,086
Did you place a bet on number six,
Broadway Bill?

1878
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:58,526
Sure crazy if you didn't.

1879
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:06,233
Two dollars on Broadway Bill.

1880
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,603
- Number six.
- Thanks.

1881
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:17,512
Well, goodbye, sawbuck.

1882
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:19,879
Might as well go crazy
with the rest of the world.

1883
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:21,315
Oh, come on, come on.

1884
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:26,521
Broadway Bill, number six,
on the schnozzola.

1885
01:39:30,998 --> 01:39:32,465
Who'd you bet on, Happy?

1886
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:34,065
Gallant Lady, of course.

1887
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:36,862
- Me too.
- Smart boy.

1888
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:39,637
<i>Which horse is going to win?</i>

1889
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,638
<i>Will it be Gallant Lady,</i>
<i>the temperamental favorite,</i>

1890
01:39:42,843 --> 01:39:44,708
<i>Sun Up, the great money horse,</i>

1891
01:39:44,912 --> 01:39:46,436
- <i>or will it be Broadway Bill?</i>
- Sit down.

1892
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:49,582
<i>A colt that's never raced before</i>
<i>and who threw his jockey</i>

1893
01:39:49,783 --> 01:39:53,617
<i>the last time out and was</i>
<i>literally laughed off the track.</i>

1894
01:39:53,887 --> 01:39:56,014
<i>The wise ones say that his owner,</i>
<i>Dan Brooks,</i>

1895
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:58,919
<i>has a screw loose somewhere</i>
<i>for entering him.</i>

1896
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:02,061
<i>But we're going to keep our eyes</i>
<i>on Broadway Bill.</i>

1897
01:40:02,262 --> 01:40:04,389
- <i>For some mysterious reason,</i>
- Sit down.

1898
01:40:04,598 --> 01:40:06,862
<i>This unknown horse</i>
<i>has been receiving terrific support.</i>

1899
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:10,525
<i>Almost overnight, the odds went down</i>
<i>from 100-to-1 to 6-to-1.</i>

1900
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:12,706
- Yes, sir?
- Any whiskey in the house?

1901
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:14,771
- No, sir.
- Get some.

1902
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:16,636
Get some!

1903
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:25,083
<i>The horses are at the gate now</i>
<i>and ready for the bell.</i>

1904
01:40:25,285 --> 01:40:26,513
<i>And what excitement.</i>

1905
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,587
Sit still on Gallant Lady there.

1906
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:34,455
Keep your eyes open, boys.

1907
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:35,889
Anything's liable to happen
in this race.

1908
01:40:36,096 --> 01:40:38,326
Don't you forget to break fast, Bill.

1909
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,530
<i>There they go.</i>

1910
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,577
He's in the vanguard.

1911
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:57,376
<i>Broadway Bill takes the lead</i>
<i>by two lengths...</i>

1912
01:41:00,287 --> 01:41:02,881
<i>... by a head, and Gotham Kid...</i>

1913
01:41:03,090 --> 01:41:05,991
<i>At the clubhouse turn,</i>
<i>Broadway Bill is in the lead</i>

1914
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:09,685
<i>by four lengths.</i>
<i>Gallant Lady is second by one length.</i>

1915
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:14,095
<i>Great Arab is third by two lengths,</i>
<i>and Sun Up...</i>

1916
01:41:14,301 --> 01:41:15,996
Quit pulling that horse.

1917
01:41:16,203 --> 01:41:17,431
Quit pulling him.

1918
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:19,663
<i>... by one length,</i>
<i>and now dropping back,</i>

1919
01:41:19,873 --> 01:41:22,341
<i>as Gallant Lady takes the lead</i>
<i>by one length.</i>

1920
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:23,976
<i>Gotham Kid is second...</i>

1921
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:26,271
Give him his head, you little thief.
Let him go.

1922
01:41:35,789 --> 01:41:37,518
Bill.

1923
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:43,486
Make way,
or I'll throw you over the fence.

1924
01:41:43,697 --> 01:41:44,925
Nuts to you.

1925
01:41:45,132 --> 01:41:47,100
We got a chance now.

1926
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:50,134
Come on. What are you trying to do?
Let go of that bit.

1927
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,531
Oh, he's got his tongue
over the bit now.

1928
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,799
He can't stop you, Bill.
He can't stop you, Bill.

1929
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,174
Let go of that bit.

1930
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:08,677
Go, go, Bill. Go.

1931
01:42:09,356 --> 01:42:13,122
- <i>It's Gallant Lady and Sun Up...</i>
- Head for home, Bill. Go, boy.

1932
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:17,295
<i>And here comes Broadway Bill,</i>
<i>moving between horses.</i>

1933
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:18,931
<i>Look at this horse go.</i>

1934
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,362
Come on, Broadway Bill.

1935
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:23,126
Come on, Broadway Bill!

1936
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:29,571
- Friend to the downtrodden!
- Come on, Broadway...

1937
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:31,368
Come on!

1938
01:42:33,413 --> 01:42:36,314
Bill. Bill. Come on.

1939
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:43,282
Come on, Broadway Bill.
Come on, Broadway Bill!

1940
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:48,154
Yes, Broadway Bill! Come on.
Come on. Come on, Broadway Bill.

1941
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:55,829
<i>They're coming into the stretch.</i>

1942
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:07,708
<i>It's Gallant Lady, Sun Up</i>
<i>and Broadway Bill, head and head,</i>

1943
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:11,009
- <i>all three together.</i>
- Come on, Bill. Come on! Come on.

1944
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:13,176
Stay back there, will you!

1945
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:16,986
Stay back, you rat.

1946
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:18,658
He's got the bit.
I can't hold him, you nit.

1947
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:21,054
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.

1948
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:34,670
<i>It's Gallant Lady and Broadway Bill.</i>
<i>Sun Up is dropping back.</i>

1949
01:43:39,179 --> 01:43:41,613
Come on. Come on, Bill. Come on.

1950
01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:44,215
<i>It's Gallant Lady and Broadway Bill.</i>

1951
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:50,788
<i>It's Broadway Bill and Gallant Lady.</i>

1952
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:57,523
<i>They're coming down to the line</i>
<i>of finish, and Broadway Bill wins it!</i>

1953
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:04,003
He did it. He did it.
Oh, he did it.

1954
01:44:04,204 --> 01:44:05,865
Oh, he did it. He did it.

1955
01:44:10,877 --> 01:44:12,504
Bill.

1956
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:14,044
Bill.

1957
01:44:19,786 --> 01:44:22,254
<i>Back off that track, will you,</i>
<i>please. Now, don't get excited.</i>

1958
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:23,718
<i>And keep back.</i>
<i>Everybody keep back.</i>

1959
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:25,755
<i>Officers, see that everybody</i>
<i>keeps off that track.</i>

1960
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:29,087
<i>You know how dangerous it is. Horses</i>
<i>will be getting back any minute.</i>

1961
01:44:29,296 --> 01:44:31,059
Fellows, can I get through?
Let me through, will you.

1962
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:33,756
- Who are you?
- This is my horse, fellas.

1963
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:37,596
<i>Officers, keep those people back.</i>
<i>Keep off the track, will you, please.</i>

1964
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:39,871
Mr. Brooks.

1965
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,535
Back it up, people. All right...

1966
01:44:42,743 --> 01:44:44,301
Let me through. Gangway.

1967
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:46,172
- How's the boy?
- The boy's OK.

1968
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:47,642
- Are you a doc?
- Yes, sir.

1969
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:49,475
- Are you a veterinary?
- Yes, sir.

1970
01:44:49,683 --> 01:44:52,413
<i>The race was over.</i>
<i>He won and then he dropped.</i>

1971
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,989
Too much for him.
Burst his heart.

1972
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:07,464
He was dead, you might say,
when he hit the dirt.

1973
01:45:07,668 --> 01:45:09,363
Too bad.

1974
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:11,264
A great horse.

1975
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:14,864
Bill.

1976
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:19,672
Will you hold it for a shot,
Mr. Brooks, please?

1977
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:21,438
Officer, get those men out of there.

1978
01:45:21,648 --> 01:45:23,479
These old eyes have seen
some great horses, but...

1979
01:45:23,684 --> 01:45:24,912
Tough break, kid.

1980
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:27,985
Come on, get back, will you, please.
Everybody, give us a little room here.

1981
01:45:28,188 --> 01:45:30,418
<i>Off the track, everybody.</i>

1982
01:46:21,074 --> 01:46:22,371
We're all grateful to Mr. Brooks

1983
01:46:22,576 --> 01:46:26,569
for permitting us to lay Broadway Bill
to rest here at the scene of his victory.

1984
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:28,779
What he did yesterday afternoon

1985
01:46:28,982 --> 01:46:32,713
was to teach us all the true meaning
of courage and loyalty.

1986
01:46:32,986 --> 01:46:37,355
Broadway Bill only ran one race,
but he ran it well.

1987
01:46:37,557 --> 01:46:40,583
For he not only overcame the speed
of his brother horses,

1988
01:46:40,794 --> 01:46:43,194
but he had to overcome the greed
in us human beings.

1989
01:46:43,997 --> 01:46:47,558
We should all feel humble
and a little ashamed that a horse

1990
01:46:47,768 --> 01:46:50,293
should teach us such a lesson
in honesty.

1991
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:53,329
If we profit by such an example,

1992
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,701
then racing will be something
more than a sport,

1993
01:46:56,543 --> 01:46:59,569
and Broadway Bill
will never be forgotten.

1994
01:47:00,046 --> 01:47:01,946
Mr. Brooks.

1995
01:48:05,278 --> 01:48:09,214
Well, I guess I'll be
saying goodbye, Dan.

1996
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:12,450
You'll be going back home
to Higginsville, huh?

1997
01:48:14,054 --> 01:48:16,147
But not you. You won't.

1998
01:48:16,356 --> 01:48:17,983
No.

1999
01:48:19,626 --> 01:48:21,992
I'll be on my way, I guess.

2000
01:48:23,697 --> 01:48:25,494
Good luck.

2001
01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:28,263
Princess, you've been swell.

2002
01:48:28,468 --> 01:48:30,732
- You've helped me over a...
- Thanks, Dan.

2003
01:48:32,172 --> 01:48:34,197
Oh, there's Dad.

2004
01:48:37,611 --> 01:48:39,044
Dan.

2005
01:48:40,213 --> 01:48:41,771
J.L.

2006
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,343
Margaret come with you?

2007
01:48:44,918 --> 01:48:46,613
No, she didn't.

2008
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:50,051
You see, Margaret sort of counted
on your coming back to Higginsville,

2009
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:52,725
- now that Broadway Bill...
- Yeah.

2010
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:55,724
I guess she figured
this would be the break.

2011
01:48:56,062 --> 01:48:58,053
I'm not going back
to Higginsville, J.L.

2012
01:48:59,432 --> 01:49:01,900
I... I don't know.

2013
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:04,633
Nothing matters much anymore.

2014
01:49:04,838 --> 01:49:07,068
Just take care of the princess, huh?

2015
01:49:18,318 --> 01:49:20,980
That's my decision, and it's final.

2016
01:49:21,187 --> 01:49:22,745
But, Father, what's come over you?

2017
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:24,583
You can't sell the paper-box factory.

2018
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:26,986
We've only been married for
two months. It isn't fair to Bertie.

2019
01:49:27,193 --> 01:49:29,718
- Yeah.
- Bertie.

2020
01:49:30,564 --> 01:49:32,691
And I'm selling the ironworks,

2021
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:36,198
the lampshade plant
and next and last, the bank.

2022
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:37,961
- No, no, not the bank.
- No, not the bank.

2023
01:49:38,171 --> 01:49:40,571
- The bank?
- Well, what will become of us?

2024
01:49:40,807 --> 01:49:42,035
You?

2025
01:49:42,776 --> 01:49:45,006
You'll have to go to work.

2026
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,692
- It's Dan.
- Princess.

2027
01:50:02,896 --> 01:50:05,364
Hey, it's Mr. Brooks, sir.

2028
01:50:05,565 --> 01:50:09,126
"Release the princess
from the dark tower", he says.

2029
01:50:18,478 --> 01:50:21,709
Well, go on. Go on.
Don't be an idiot like your sister.

Princess!

Looking for someone?

2032
