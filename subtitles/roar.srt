2
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:27,651
Do you have to fight with
your lazy relatives all day?

3
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:35,276
- I telegraphed him that we come today.
- You telegraphed him 8 o'clock.

4
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,567
But in the morning or in the evening?

5
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:40,234
That's it. He thinks we
arrive in the evening.

6
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,276
Shit!

7
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:10,151
Please empty this bottle or
you won't get a good night kiss.

8
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:42,192
They ordered the commission to
regulate the wildlife stock.

9
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:45,359
- They don't come just because of you.
- Why do we need such things?

10
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:50,942
Last weekend they killed
more than 200 elephants.

11
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:55,942
This is a gun, you
don't need it. Get away.

12
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:02,067
Why are the big ones so angry?

13
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:06,817
- Toga is back, that's why they are angry.
- Toga is back?

14
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:10,109
He always tries to get into
the pride, but doesn't know how.

15
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:15,567
When they see the conflicts here
they won't expand your contract.

16
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:18,651
Just because of Toga.

17
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,276
Then it's over with your
animals and your family too.

18
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:26,067
- How is your antelope?
- Great, just like me.

19
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,317
As long as your pets
won't come too close.

20
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:05,692
But I don't have blood everywhere.

21
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:10,359
They don't use napkins.
And Toga is a lone wolf.

22
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:12,442
Nobody cleans him up.

23
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,192
Look at this.

24
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:26,192
Now they arrive, although
I'm waiting for my family.

25
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:04,817
He became an alpha animal because
this is the only way to study them.

26
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,609
Respect for Hank's studies,
the commission is overwhelmed.

27
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,484
We are here to congratulate.

28
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:28,526
Then Africa will be soon be
the land of Liger and Tigons.

29
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,359
A mixture between tiger and lion.

30
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:22,484
Get away!

31
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:08,984
I declare war, Hank!
We will kill them all! And you!

32
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:17,859
The animals were nervous because of a
lion who does not belong to the pride.

33
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,276
Normally he lives anywhere else.

34
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,026
I saw him 200 miles away from here.

35
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:01,984
I think he and Robbie are brothers.
They both have a huge black mane.

36
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,484
They also act similar.

37
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:35,234
One of your children
likes thumb-sucking.

38
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:37,359
Please behave.

39
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:45,442
When I get into their
conflicts they fight me.

40
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:50,317
You won't find a whip in this
house. Or anything like this.

41
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:52,942
If you love them, they love you.

42
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:56,359
When I want them to trust me
I have to accept their rules.

43
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,317
And they must accept me as
one of their pride. Understand?

44
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,026
He likes this very much... Au!

45
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:08,276
Don't be evil! I told you before!

46
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:11,234
They only play, they don't
know how strong they are.

47
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:14,901
Were are you going to sleep
when your family is here?

48
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:18,609
I mean what is your wife thinking?

49
00:29:19,317 --> 00:29:22,234
Of course I will sleep in the
same bed with Madelaine. Why?

50
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:28,234
Get away, you hurt my foot.

51
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:37,234
I think Madelaine will sleep alone,
reading a book and cursing you.

52
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:43,192
This is Marc. If you drink a beer
you have to be careful. He loves beer.

53
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:46,026
Your lions are drinking beer?

54
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,484
I bet your family will run
away soon after seeing this.

55
00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:55,276
Why is he dancing like
this? He want to marry me?

56
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:57,526
She does not know...

57
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:02,942
Are you crazy? Don't be so rough!

58
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:09,651
Okay, this is better. Please
don't say anything now.

59
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:15,192
I don't want to hear a word.

60
00:30:15,484 --> 00:30:20,109
Okay, what should I say? Can I help you?

61
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,526
- Take me to the living room?
- And the lions?

62
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:26,859
- They do nothing because I'm hurt.
- I hope they know it.

63
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,776
Tell me why you didn't
get here with dad?

64
00:30:40,067 --> 00:30:44,359
- Because of your and Melanie's school.
- We were old enough.

65
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:47,192
No. I know you.

66
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:49,151
You never trusted us.

67
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:31,317
This is unique.

68
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:34,276
As long she has milk
she let all kids come.

69
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,442
No matter what race.

70
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:47,567
Look, Margie, what I have.
Two more babies for you.

71
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:55,151
They are cute. Little leopards.
You will feed them, okay?

72
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:57,567
Please be nice to your new mother.

73
00:32:03,192 --> 00:32:05,776
Don't bite your mother.

74
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,359
Yes, you are hungry.

75
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:13,192
And what about you?

76
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:19,942
Don't run away. Good guys. See you.

77
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:51,442
Are you crazy? Tiger on the boat...

78
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:55,692
I can sing a song. Hopefully
the tigers run away.

79
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:14,192
You hate me singing?

80
00:33:40,026 --> 00:33:42,901
Hey, do you know why elephants
have such long trunks?

81
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:45,651
Then you can differ them from the frogs.

82
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,401
You have such a long
nose for the same reason.

83
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:52,401
When I see you I like
to eat frog's legs.

84
00:33:57,776 --> 00:34:00,942
I don't suppose you want to scare
me with your Karate for old people.

85
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:06,734
One hit left, one hit right,
you won't get me in the middle.

86
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:09,609
Stop it! Now!

87
00:34:13,942 --> 00:34:18,526
Stop it! We don't need
this at the moment.

88
00:34:23,776 --> 00:34:25,442
- Idiot!
- Stop it!

89
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:29,234
Stop it now!

90
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:32,276
Look the animal!

91
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:38,776
- What animal?
- You!

92
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:44,567
I was so beautiful for you father.

93
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:02,776
Your animals do not care.

94
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:07,942
Look the boat, you can throw it away.

95
00:36:08,692 --> 00:36:11,567
- Where's the second?
- Rocco, where are you?

96
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:17,484
Good. And now get out of the water.

97
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:20,776
Or I will throw with mud.

98
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:45,067
Stop shooting, you will hurt us!

99
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,234
What can I do, the animal will hurt you!

100
00:50:54,734 --> 00:50:56,734
- How much bullets are left?
- Five.

101
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:40,026
I wanted to visit a
baseball game with him.

102
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:42,859
I will never see him
again but you don't care!

103
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:44,776
Stop be hysterical.

104
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:49,651
Your father is still alive, believe me.

105
00:55:49,942 --> 00:55:52,276
He will come soon.

106
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,859
You also wanted to
get away from Chicago.

107
00:55:56,151 --> 00:55:58,067
But we didn't know what
trouble this causes.

108
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:01,317
All will be good.

109
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:05,192
I hope you are right.

110
00:56:06,317 --> 00:56:08,526
Come, relax.

111
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:13,484
No!

111
