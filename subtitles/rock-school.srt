Delicious Vegan Sausages, Cheese
and Burgers - Vegusto.co.uk

2
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,885
Three, four.

3
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,468
'Kay, this little dude here is
gonna rock your ass tonight.!

4
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,094
Swear to God.

5
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,639
The other guys are gonna
rock your asses too.

6
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,902
It's a good one. It's a good one.

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,776
I only got angry six times
during nine weeks of rehearsals.

8
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,783
That's gotta mean somethin', all right?
Thank you guys for comin' tonight.

9
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,851
You guys ready to rock tonight?

10
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,551
I'm gonna ask for one more big hand,
'cause these kids worked really hard.

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,255
You guys can set off the whole thing
tonight. One more big hand. Come on.

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,758
Ladies and gentlemen,
our tribute to the guitar gods.

13
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:14,699
Five, six, five, six, seven, eight.

14
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,966
Hey, did you guys ever see my
Silence of the Lambs impression?

15
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,044
- Yes.
- Oh, God.

16
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,045
Who's here saw
Silence of the Lambs?

17
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,047
- Yes.
- That's the best movie of all time.

18
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,049
He does.
He spits, though.

19
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,314
If you don't want spit on you,
I'd suggest you move.

20
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,082
Okay. Very good. Very good.

21
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,090
Guys, you gotta watch this.

22
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,027
Come on. Stop!

23
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,563
Put the lotion in the basket!

24
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:56,504
It puts the lotion in the basket,
or it gets the hose!

25
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,712
It puts the lotion in the basket,
or it gets the hose!

26
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,306
Put the fuckin' lotion in the basket!

27
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,908
Thank you.

28
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,783
I'm qualified to teach-
I'm probably not qualified to teach.

29
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,189
But I have people on staff
with music degrees, for those parents-

30
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,354
I'm self-quali-
I mean, I'm a really good teacher.

31
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,761
I just say that 'cause I am.

32
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,164
I mean, I just-
It comes naturally to me.

33
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,168
And I've honed my craft
over the years.

34
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,832
You know- Some people can just play.
I can just teach.

35
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,775
And I'll teach all day.
I'll teach you somethin' right now.

36
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,472
Okay? I'll teach you
how to take a punch.

37
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,763
It started out with just 17 kids
coming over to my apartment every week.

38
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,600
I thought they gettin' real good.

39
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,766
I had a practice space
when I was with my band.

40
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,311
So I said, "Okay, kids,
let's get together on Saturday and jam."

41
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,778
And we did, and the kids were awful.

42
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,181
All those scales and chords and songs
they learned were useless.

43
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,186
I'm a stubborn son of a bitch.

44
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,121
So I said, "Okay, we're gettin' together
every Saturday until you guys get this."

45
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,124
Then it was only three
or four Saturdays later...

46
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,127
where the kids I was bringin' to the thing
were so much better.

47
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,129
All the strings-

48
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:28,928
Big ideas I was able to express in
concrete terms that kids could understand.

49
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,094
So- And I loved it.

50
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,263
It wasn'tjust like,
"Since my band didn't make it...

51
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,307
I'll teach guitar,
and I'll be all bitter."

52
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,468
I was like, you know, "This is cool.
And I don't have to carry equipment."

53
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,274
It was only a matter of time from there
that a friend of mine...

54
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,872
who had heard us jamming
and working on things said...

55
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,951
"Why don't you guys play
at my art opening?"

56
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,355
Let's do it!

57
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,662
And the kids were amazing.
There were, like, 200 people there.

58
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,633
There was, like, glass windows outside,
and people were six deep outside.

59
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,296
At that point, I was like,
"Okay, this is somethin' here."

60
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,382
- Tucker, just do it.
- Okay, fine.

61
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:31,730
I wanna be a musician
when I grow up...

62
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,358
because I wanna go on tour.

63
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,403
And that's the reason why
I wanna be a musician.

64
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:43,305
I want-Wait.
What was the question you asked?

65
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:48,870
I wanna be a musician
when I grow up so I can-

66
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,542
so I can, like, go to concerts...

67
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:57,453
- Hello.
- Get free tickets to go to places.

68
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,548
- Hello.
- And things like that.

69
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,423
AC/DC's really simple.

70
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:07,227
And all you do is-
One and two and three and four.

71
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,167
One and two and three and four.

72
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,706
Collins twins. You know,
I think they- They go to school.

73
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,900
I think it's hard for them
to practice a lot on their own.

74
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,739
But they don't- I'm not sayin'-
They're nine-year-olds.

75
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,781
They need to work
a little more on music.

76
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,374
One thing I don't really like is people
appreciating the novelty of playing music.

77
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,386
So, even if you're nine-

78
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,786
I mean, that's the whole point
of what we do here is not...

79
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,824
"Come look at kids play music."

80
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,086
It's, "Come and look at kids
play music well."

81
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,128
I learned a long time ago...

82
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,028
if you don't tell a kid what
they can't do, they may never find out.

83
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,033
I'm not gonna cut them short
and say...

84
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,330
"You're nine. Let's put you on stage
and not turn your volume up."

85
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,270
You know. Who knows?
Maybe Tucker can play drums.

86
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,968
And maybe all it takes
is someone believing in them...

87
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,070
in a way where it's, like,
all you gotta do is practice.

88
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,652
You know, C.J. Makes it hard
for everybody else.

89
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,653
C.J.'s 12, and look how good he is.

90
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,887
I'm gonna be in a band.
I'm gonna be writin' songs.

91
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,256
Yeah, I'm gonna sell millions.

92
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,301
Stuff, hopefully.

93
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,964
We tried baseball,
and I think he tried soft- soccer?

94
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,064
- Uh-huh.
- Soccer.

95
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,043
And martial arts,
and that's really not his thing.

96
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,613
For him, I mean, the guitar is it.

97
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,110
When he started playing guitar,
I asked him what he wanted to be.

98
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,487
He said, "I wanna be a rock star."

99
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,651
At the time,
he was good enough.

100
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,697
I didn't see any reason why, you know,
I would discourage him from doing that.

101
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,097
C.J. Is gonna make us all
a lot of money.

102
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,102
Couldn't ask for more in a kid.

103
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:55,971
Soft-spoken, kind, smart,
hardworking, talented.

104
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,168
Not only does he have the talent...

105
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:02,805
but I've never seen focus
in somebody that age.

106
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:07,215
Pretty much after every performance,
I could say I try-

107
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,416
I wanna do better than that,
even though that was good.

108
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,322
I want to strive to be perfect.

109
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,828
Yeah, I'm kind of a perfection-
perfectionist.

110
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,236
Whenever I do coffeehouses
and stufflike that...

111
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,536
I play, like, Sheryl Crow
and all the folky stuff...

112
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,271
then stuff that I wrote,
which is not always rock.

113
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,112
Because, my voice, actually,
kind of shines with folky things.

114
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,742
You know, like Sheryl Crow
and the Dixie Chicks.

115
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,048
Madi's a pain in my ass, okay?

116
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,613
Madi has all the support- I don't think
that girl was told no once in her life.

117
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,699
Madi's a girl who came to me...

118
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,097
and she walked right in,
in front of a room full of people...

119
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,228
picked up an acoustic guitar
and sang a Sheryl Crow song.

120
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,068
And I was amazed that a teenage girl
would have the courage...

121
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,766
to sing a Sheryl Crow song.

122
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,640
I gasped that she would sing a Sheryl
Crow song. You know what I mean?

123
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,010
If I had to bet on the five kids
who were gonna make it...

124
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,582
in some way I'd say Madi's one.

125
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,084
She's confident.
She's, you know, she has a good look.

126
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,485
She-A little dated, but it works.

127
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,581
She can play guitar.
She can sing.

128
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,523
She could probably make it
without my help.

129
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,028
My concern is, is she gonna
make it as, you know, . Jewel?

130
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,326
Or is she gonna make it
as. Joni Mitchell...

131
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,163
who could fuckin'play guitar?
I'll tell you what.

132
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,433
I'm William H. O'Connor.

133
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,913
I was born Caesarean birth.

134
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,415
My head was too big to come out
of my mother's uterus...

135
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,681
and the umbilical cord
was wrapped around my neck.

136
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,724
I have received, I think,
brain damage from that, they think.

137
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:57,558
And from one to three,
I had to wear a neck brace...

138
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,688
because my head was too big.

139
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,791
And I had to sleep standing-
sitting up like the Elephant Man.

140
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,427
Otherwise, blood would rush
to my head and I would die.

141
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,369
I was misdiagnosed as retarded

142
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,442
and entered the sixth-
Kindergarten at age seven.

143
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,275
Other kids would tease me,
call me stupid and retarded.

144
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:20,148
I had to go to special L.D. Classes
for reading and writing.

145
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,619
Up till five, I wasn't
given a chance for anything...

146
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,715
and I wasn't allowed
to leave my house.

147
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,091
I spent most of my time
with my mother, who has one hand...

148
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,993
and she taught me how to draw.

149
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,534
And, basically, that's what I do
with my life. I'm an artist.

150
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,626
I like to draw.

151
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:43,573
I've attempted suicide a lot-
since very young.

152
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,008
I can remember when I was little...

153
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:50,549
wrapping the extension cord
of the vacuum cleaner around my neck...

154
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,641
and trying to jump off the banister.

155
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,848
One of my only friends
was a member of Rock School...

156
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,925
and I went to see him
at a performance.

157
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,429
I was sitting off by myself and Paul Green
actually asked me to join Rock School.

158
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,021
He is a piss-poor musician.

159
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,567
I mean, and he's, like,
"I wanna be challenged this season."

160
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,762
I gave him some challenging
songs and I would-

161
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:17,207
I would be stunned if he learns
half his songs correctly. And we'll see.

162
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,871
I think I greatly overestimated
Will's ability to better himself.

163
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:26,145
Here's some of his bass songs. Will's like,
"I want a challenge." Here's a challenge-

164
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,016
Will you stop making fun of Will
for the night? 'Cause he's clearly upset.

165
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,824
It's or-fay the ovie-may.

166
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,124
See?

167
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,495
I kind of see Paul
as a role model for me.

168
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,799
'Cause he was someone who, much like me,
didn't have a very good home life...

169
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,340
and left his house at 15.

170
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:53,003
And built this whole
music empire for himself.

171
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,348
If it wasn't for Rock School...

172
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,250
and a few other things,
I'd probably be dead, honestly.

173
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,255
And I'm barely alive now.

174
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:12,394
Okay, the fourth, when it bends,
makes you sound like. Jimi Hendrix.

175
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,327
So you know that's in your arsenal.

176
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,464
Whenever you're playin' a solo, you go
to that, 'cause you know that does that.

177
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,440
So then, like-

178
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,741
Five-five. Evil.
Devil's-The devil's interval.

179
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,012
Evil

180
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,313
And then like-

181
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,412
Major seven.
Fairy

182
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,616
Devil

183
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,920
Not devil.

184
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,824
So, basically, I have
two goals with the kids.

185
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:49,299
Get the kids to, realize
their potential musically...

186
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,301
to get 'em as good as possible...

187
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,497
and then to get 'em out on stage
in front of as many people as possible.

188
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,703
So, you know, my only real interest
in any of these kids...

189
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,542
is to really see what they can do once you
strip away the fear and the laziness.

190
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:07,244
Watch Will. Five bucks says
he doesn't get any of his songs right.

191
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,914
Will, is it because
you're talently deficient?

192
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,515
- 'Cause I don't practice enough.
- You don't practice at all.

193
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,822
To get the second goal,
we have our all-star program.

194
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,988
Right now, we're doing
the music of Frank Zappa.

195
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:32,806
Zappa a lot of times enters in modes and
blues and jazz and the classical ideas.

196
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:36,678
So the whole goal, initially,
is to get as good as possible.

197
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,182
Then, when you're really seasoned-
I mean, and seasoned-

198
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:43,483
These 16-year-olds
are very, you know...

199
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,489
sophisticated musicians.

200
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,721
Everything leads towards then playing Zappa,
and I become their manager, in essence.

201
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,230
And I try to get them
as good of gigs as possible.

202
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,870
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

203
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,277
We're gonna learn the music.
We're gonna learn the music real fast.

204
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,178
And I say this every time,
and I'm like an alcoholic.

205
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,717
I say this time things are gonna be
different, and things aren't different.

206
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,515
We're scheduling rehearsals
right at the end.

207
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,523
We're like, let's try the song
as crappy as possible. Get it up on stage.

208
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,593
So that I don't have to
cut you from your songs...

209
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,561
and your parents, like, "I paid all that money,
and my kid was only in two songs. Why?"

210
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:28,155
I have to explain to 'em, your kid's lazy.
They smoke dope. They don't practice.

211
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,827
You know what I mean?
So let's not get into that.

212
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,927
And practice early and often.

213
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,905
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

214
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,498
Try that.

215
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,089
Two, one, two.

216
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,229
- Yes. Now you gotta practice it.
- I gotta practice it.

217
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,699
Here, follow me.
Here's what I do.

218
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,071
This is an average day for me.
Come along.

219
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,911
I go in, and I'll visit in on students,
and I'll berate them.

220
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,280
'Cause we have a very sophisticated game
of good cop, bad cop.

221
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,286
So I'll go in... to Dylan's lesson here,
and talk to Cat...

222
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,618
and tell her a couple things
I don't like.

223
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:29,023
Then, when I leave, I can assure you
Dylan's, like, "We'll show him."

224
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,390
- Hi, Cat. This is Cat Sherman.
- Hi.

225
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,992
Cat's got much rock heart
in her heart.

226
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,537
The heart of rock and roll
beats within that breast.

227
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,372
But yet, due to some, I'll say,
parental issues, or something...

228
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,536
she's afraid to unleash it
on the crowd.

229
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:53,175
But this show, Guitar Gods, she will
unleash it, as you lay waste in her wake.

230
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,118
Look at her.
Doesn't she look rock and roll?

231
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,622
She has, sort, of that Chris Robinson,
future heroin addict look about her?

232
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,793
Thanks.

233
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,247
Cool. Do you remember what
we did the last time, though?

234
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,248
- With the-
- Yeah.

235
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,376
Where we were counting?
Let me hear you do that.

236
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:32,480
All right. One and- One and two and
two and three. Hold on.

237
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:37,221
One and two and three and four
and five and six and seven and-

238
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,561
One and two and three and four.
One and two and three and four.

239
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,998
And then from that dot
to the other dot.

240
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,100
Which strings though?

241
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,549
So, it's two-two-two notes
in a row on the fifth fret.

242
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,385
Do that much.

243
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,753
Then...

244
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,400
No, wait. It's-

245
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,630
- All right. Let's play it, then.
- Okay. Try it.

246
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,368
You know, I never say,
"Turn that down." Or everything stops.

247
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,236
If you wanna play your music,
turn it up to 11. I don't care.

248
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,400
You know, I love it.

249
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,104
When I was young, all I wanted
to be was a rock star, you know?

250
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,272
I wanted to be famous
and be a rock star.

251
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,943
Now I get to kinda sorta
live vicariously through my kids.

252
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,486
Why don't you play some Sabbath?

253
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,718
I don't really know
"Paranoid" that well.

254
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,592
I think Paul called me a soccer mom,
only without the soccer.

255
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,359
You know? I'm like, "Did you practice?"
I didn't hear you. I can't hear you.

256
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,426
Nobody gets credit for practicing
unless I hear it. You know?

257
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:28,870
It's like, "Turn your amp up.
Lemme hear you practice. Do it again."

258
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,999
I don't know what
it's supposed to sound like.

259
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,044
So, I'm, like, "That sounds right."

260
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:38,310
I would like to think
that what Paul is doing-

261
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:42,148
It should be bringing, like, families
together. You know, parents and kids.

262
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,215
Mom?

263
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,317
Set the table, would you?

264
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,919
- Mom.
- Come on. Get the forks and knives out.

265
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,329
Not sit. Get the forks
and knives out.

266
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,796
You're capable.

267
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,270
My mom's into this thing where
she tries to show people...

268
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,341
that we have some
semblance of a normal life.

269
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,876
- We really don't.
- That's right. We fake it. Yeah, right.

270
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,378
Ordinarily, I wouldn't be doing
any work around the house.

271
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,471
- He does too.
- At all.

272
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,244
So what are you playing right now
for Rock School, the '80s show?

273
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,345
"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,"
"Bad," "Land Down Under."

274
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,424
You wouldn't really know it.
It's not your generation.

275
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,516
- No, it's not my music.
- You know Girl's-

276
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,858
I didn't know anything about
Rock School until this year.

277
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,956
It's not the Sorbonne.
It's not studying atJuilliard.

278
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:32,628
But those interests
aren't what William is.

279
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,105
Do I see William becoming
a great musician? I don't know.

280
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:40,736
You do like to perform, don't you?

281
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:45,112
- Mom, Jesus Christ. Don't cross me.
- Don't cross you?

282
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:49,153
I think in the future, though,
by the time I'm 30, I could be decent.

283
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:52,485
Not good but decent at the bass.

284
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,218
- Is that your goal?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,293
By 30?

286
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,954
Not by 30. I don't even know if
I'll be alive then, honestly.

287
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,894
You know, the old,
"We're with a group...

288
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,523
we go sit on the tree stump by ourselves
and hope someone talks to us."

289
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,534
That's Will's life,
you know what I mean?

290
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:08,231
I don't buy it for a minute. Another thing
I do with Will is I listen to what he says.

291
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,001
And he hates that.
And he loves it.

292
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,269
So he'll make a statement.
And I'm like, "Really?"

293
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,607
And it drives him nuts,
and he eventually goes away.

294
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,613
But, you know,
I don't think people listen to him.

295
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:22,347
He's trying to play that 16-year-old
coffee shop intellectual, mopey, droopy-

296
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,481
But, you know.
That's a role for a 1980s movie.

297
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,460
- Do you yell at Paul?
- No. I'm afraid of Paul.

298
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,962
- He has more of a temper than you have?
- Sure.

299
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,728
That's his way of keeping
you guys in control, huh?

300
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,066
- No. He's just fuckin' crazy.
- Well-

301
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,436
Don't you think he'd have to
have a lot of energy...

302
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,806
to keep track of how many
16, 17, 18-year-olds?

303
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,469
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,479
- That much l-
- Sure.

305
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,675
So, for as crazy as he may or may not be,
I give him a lot of credit.

306
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,719
Yeah, sure. I do too.
He's a great guy.

307
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,757
- I don't have a problem with him.
- Yeah. He's always been nice to me.

308
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:03,817
He's different around the parents.

309
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,338
Die, scoundrel! Kneel!

310
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:25,007
- Say it! Say it!
- All hail Paul.

311
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,584
Good.

312
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:51,170
One, two. You mess up once, I'll fuckin'
punch your face out, all right?

313
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,677
- Okay.
- Okay. One, two, three, four.

314
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,771
You have to love this.
Do you love this song?

315
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,448
Do you love Dio?
Do you love Satan?

316
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,980
- Do you love Satan?
- Yes.

317
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,254
I love you.
I want you to rock. That's all.

318
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,728
I want to give you...
the gift of rock.

319
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,131
Do you love, like, hot women
and rock music and all that?

320
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,601
'Cause that's what Satan gives us.

321
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:23,368
To tempt us...
from what we should be doing.

322
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,103
Like, the whole trend in education now
is, you don't compare children.

323
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,078
I do. She's better than you.

324
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,172
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

325
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,251
You know what the problem is, Shannon?

326
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,842
You're pretty good at singing.

327
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,649
You're pretty good at keyboards.
You're pretty good at vocals. You know?

328
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,690
But you're not as good as
the Zappa keyboard players.

329
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,258
You're not as good
as the Zappa vocalists...

330
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,419
and you're not as good
as the Zappa guitar players.

331
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,361
- Just fuckin' do what I say for a change!
- Okay, okay.

332
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,127
- You wanna dump crying today?
- No.

333
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,134
- Don't look at your fingers!
- All right.

334
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,534
Girls look at their fingers.
You wanna be a girl guitar player?

335
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,629
- No.
- You wanna be in the Bangles?

336
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,766
You even stop working
for one second, you're out.

337
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,844
You're out of Rock School. All right?

338
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,108
I'm gonna hunt your dad.
I'm gonna kill your family. All right?

339
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,945
I am. I will kill your family.

340
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,420
I will send Angelo and Johnny
to your house, kill your family.

341
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:14,049
And they will bathe in the blood,
all right? Bloodbath?

342
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,956
This chair does not need to be here.

343
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,689
You know, you're not loud enough.
You're not loud enough, okay?

344
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,095
I told you to come in
and take care of the keyboards, okay?

345
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,190
Get, you know, your feet in back.
Let's set us up.

346
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,895
I mean, I'm not your fuckin' roadie.
I'm really not.

347
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,165
You know what, John?
You know what? Fuck you, John.

348
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,173
- You know what? Just go. Just go.
- What?

349
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,902
You-You know-

350
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,945
I just told you what to play!

351
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,447
Just get the fuck out of here, okay?

352
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,984
Who the fuck do you-
I'm your fuckin' teacher.

353
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,180
Okay? I own the best fuckin' music school
in the city. In the fuckin' east coast!

354
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,221
When I first joined,
I was horrified.

355
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,560
I was like, "What did I join?
What is this? Some cult?"

356
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:32,865
I think Paul wants us to
think it's fun and serious.

357
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,603
Paul is-

358
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,699
He's like a second dad to me.
It's kind of weird.

359
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,335
He is the best teacher
I've ever had.

360
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:45,473
And he pushes you.
'Cause he knows what each student thinks.

361
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,984
Like, he knows if you
think you're too good...

362
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,077
or he knows if you don't
think you're good enough.

363
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,816
He, like, always tells me
I suck and stuff.

364
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:57,657
That kinda gets me to, like,
practice a lot more and stuff.

365
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,855
And he still tells me I suck.

366
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:03,526
So, he treats you how
you need to be treated...

367
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,696
to get yourself to be the best guitar
player, singer, whatever, that you can be.

368
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,741
God, Paul has been so influential
on my musical taste...

369
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,776
because before we
came into Rock School...

370
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,438
- we were listening to Bush and stuff.
- And 311.

371
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:19,779
Before, I was into, like, Korn
and Limp Bizkit, and crap like that.

372
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,912
He definitely has that
random thought thing going on-

373
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,616
when he teaches the kids,
but I think they like it.

374
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,252
It's a lovable quirk that
he's mentally disturbed.

375
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,956
He yells and screams.

376
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:37,194
And I know I don't react
very well to that type of teaching.

377
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:42,262
I gotta tell you, he scared me to death,
'cause he kept yellin' at people.

378
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,275
The bottom line is, you
can't argue with success.

379
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:51,316
He's able to bring out things in some of
these kids that, honestly, I don't see.

380
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,351
Yeah, his, definitely, his method is-

381
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,545
He tries to get on the kid's level.

382
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,455
Okay. This is a Vietnam picture
I'm workin' on.

383
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,460
It's about four buddies-

384
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:08,158
The narrator, Fatty,
Brooklyn, and the Kid.

385
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:13,329
Okay? They're basically running gumbo duty
up the Yang Kwai river, you know.

386
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:16,407
Sort of like Behind Enemy Lines,
that kind of thing.

387
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:21,036
And he plays a Vietnamese regular,
V.C., Vietcong, all that.

388
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,344
Who, we actually let go earlier in the movie
'cause we're a platoon with a heart.

389
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,511
But after we let him go, he actually
kills Fatty later in the picture, okay?

390
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,680
So, now, we've captured him again.

391
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,418
And okay.
You're playin' Brooklyn.

392
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,326
I'm the narrator, right?
We're askin' him where the guns are.

393
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,024
'Cause they're in the village somewhere,
but we can't find them.

394
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,999
Where are the guns?
Where are the guns?

395
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,969
Where are the fuckin' guns?

396
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:51,099
- Where are the guns? Where are the guns?
- He doesn't understand you!

397
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,769
He doesn't understand me?
You understand me, don't you?

398
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:59,282
You understood how to kill Fatty!
You understood that, didn't you?

399
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,282
Thank you.

400
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,792
I need more coffee.

401
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:15,457
A long time ago, in fact,
I had to reconcile the...

402
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,025
Paul the guitar player
with Paul the guitar teacher.

403
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,732
'Cause our goals are very different.
If I succeed as Paul the guitar teacher...

404
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,639
I'm making kids who are, frankly,
better guitar players than me...

405
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,735
which Paul the guitar player
doesn't like at all.

406
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,473
Sometimes a kid'll get good...

407
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,209
and I'll start practicin'to stay
a couple steps ahead of them.

408
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,152
Probably what got me started
in rock music...

409
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,887
was what got
a lot of people started.

410
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,622
One, I loved music growin'up.

411
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,893
Two, I noticed that if I played guitar,
people noticed me.

412
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,534
Music and, sort of, playing
guitar sort of came easy to me.

413
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:57,005
I noticed that it set me apart
from people, and I enjoyed that.

414
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:01,408
I really feel like Paul...

415
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,383
was and is, like, a genius musician.

416
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:11,353
Man, the stuffhe used to write
for the band was really incredible.

417
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,924
I mean, really innovative and amazing.

418
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,289
You know the movie Almost Famous?

419
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,192
Saw that movie, great movie. It's just
a feel-good movie. You're smilin'.

420
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,925
With all the music
and the good feelings in that movie...

421
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,830
I realized I still
wanted to be a rock star...

422
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,903
but I wanted to be
a rock star in 1972.

423
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,131
Like, I'd never want to be
a rock star now, you know?

424
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:34,178
So, like, I get to do music, live off it,
not have to cut fish for a living.

425
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,713
And at the same time...

426
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:42,344
not have all the attendant pratfalls
of being a musician in today's age.

427
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,905
Okay. That gentleman's name
is Napoleon Murphy-Brock.

428
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,450
I got ahold ofhim
last night. I talked to him.

429
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:18,147
And I said, "If you could
tell the kids one thing"-

430
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,453
At some point, I'm gonna bring him here,
and he's gonna talk to you kids.

431
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,119
'Cause maybe you'll listen to him.
You know what I'm sayin'?

432
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:28,928
'Cause he only played, you know,
in the Zappa band and... is awesome.

433
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,433
And he said this.
I swear to God. Verbatim.

434
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:35,802
When he performs, he realizes
that those people out in the audience...

435
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,273
could have sat home
and watched TV that night.

436
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,812
But they came to see you,
and they deserve a show.

437
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:45,872
And not a plaid-shirt-
and-baseball-hat-and-jeans...

438
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,578
we're-just-three-guys-playing-
three-chords-up-here show.

439
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:52,349
'Cause that shit sucks.
And it has no staying power.

440
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,948
Okay? But a real show.

441
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,687
He said the best way to have
the audience love what you do...

442
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,195
is you love it and let it show.

443
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,494
And I'm not tellin' you this.
Napoleon Murphy-Brock's tellin' you this.

444
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,262
You went to see Zappa
back in the day, he's gonna-

445
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,032
You buy your ticket, he's goin' out
and gonna put on three hours...

446
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,107
and you're not gonna be bored
for one second.

447
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,108
That's what I'm tryin'
to teach you guys to do.

448
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,577
I'm tryin' to teach you guys to be way
above any of that stuff that's there now.

449
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,946
You know my dream, right?
Rolling Stone magazine, 2007.

450
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,713
Where did all these bands come from?
And they start tracing people back to me.

451
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,415
And all of a sudden there's this
new movement of significant music.

452
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,792
As an educational tool,
it's ended up being perfect.

453
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,094
I'll cast a kid. I'll say here, you are
assigned to the hardest Zappa song ever.

454
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,192
Then, when they don't have it
after a couple of weeks...

455
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,998
I'll say, "What are you doing?

456
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:44,040
What are you doing? Are you watching TV?
Go practice your song."

457
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,406
So, never do I indicate,
"You shouldn't be doin' this."

458
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,139
So they think,
"I can do this if I just practice."

459
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,238
And then they do practice.
And then they can do it.

460
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,180
So the next thing you know,
we're playing Zappa tunes...

461
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,047
with saxophones and xylophones...

462
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:58,589
and vocal harmonies,
and, forget what the question was.

463
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,126
I think after you listen
to music like Frank Zappa...

464
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:06,163
and you play it, and you've like,
"Yes. I can master that song."

465
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:10,564
And then you listen to, like, 311,
you're like, that's such a simple song.

466
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,536
It's really an honor
to be a part of something like that.

467
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:19,008
And I'm so excited that Paul is actually
putting this out there and saying...

468
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,375
"Hey, guys, look at
what these kids can do." You know?

469
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,856
Zappa's gonna continue from now.
It's gonna be the, you know-

470
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,158
You practice, you get in this.
You get in this, cool things happen.

471
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,993
If you're not gonna work for me
and you're not gonna listen...

472
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,199
I have no use for you. Okay?

473
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:56,646
And the people who do work for me,
I'm gonna fuckin' hook up so awesome.

474
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,377
The Zappa kids are playing the Trocadero
three times between now and June 1.

475
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:05,081
Okay? We're playing
Borders bookshop on Saturday.

476
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,417
We're gonna rock
the fuckin' bookshelves.

477
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,122
I'm takin' 'em to Germany, okay?

478
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:18,100
We got asked to play
the Zappanale Festival in Germany...

479
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:22,605
which is, like, this huge,
just, crazy Zappa festival.

480
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,246
I don't know if it's gonna be
some kind of free-for-all...

481
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,325
crazy Zappa people everywhere.

482
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,394
I hope I don't get too nervous...

483
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,395
because I heard there was gonna
be thousands of people there.

484
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,294
No, I'm definitely not
going to Germany.

485
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,129
- Why do you say it like that?
- What? No.

486
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,137
I don't know. It's like the forbidden
fruit that you'll never taste.

487
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,571
Like, these are the good kids,
and these are the rewards.

488
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,142
You suck, and you'll never get shit.

489
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,212
We're gonna play with
Napoleon Murphy-Brock and Ike Willis...

490
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,110
and all these famous Zappa people.

491
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:08,345
I'm, like, half nervous, half excited.

492
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,183
I just know it's gonna turn out to be...

493
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,223
like, one of the best
playing experiences of my life...

494
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,690
'cause we're gonna be playing
with these-my heroes.

495
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,207
Paul actually usually bashes on me more
about being a Quaker than anything else.

496
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,778
It's okay.

497
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:40,283
Quakerism for me, like, I have been
going to meetings since I was seven.

498
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,353
I was in a lot of leadership positions...

499
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,614
and was really out there,
doing, you know, service...

500
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,952
in homeless communities...

501
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,425
andjust lots of peace activism.

502
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,730
I don't do Quakerism stuff
that much anymore...

503
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,461
because I'm more involved here,
and I really hate my school.

504
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,903
And I really hate the area
that I live in...

505
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:06,306
so I look forward to coming to Rock School
and hanging out with my friends here.

506
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,611
I couldn't let this show
go a month, two months...

507
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,984
without putting it on stage.

508
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,217
Basically tonight's a tune-up
for everything that comes after tonight.

509
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:25,227
You guys, if not tonight, then very soon,
we'll have the best show in town. Really.

510
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,263
I mean, go out and see some bands.

511
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,925
Then you'll just realize
how fuckin' awesome we are.

512
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:34,664
And not even we- Me. No.

513
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:39,505
You. And not all of you.
But most of you. Okay?

514
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,704
Her solos-You know, she-
In rehearsal, her solos are great.

515
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:46,045
At the show, she just stands there.
No one's even noticing she's playing a solo.

516
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,675
Last night- Did you see
what I did Sunday night?

517
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,755
And she was pissed.
But her solo sounded good for once.

518
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,022
I mean, be a fuckin'rock star.

519
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,925
I always say that
at the beginning of rehearsals.

520
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,929
If you don't wanna be great,
let me know.

521
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,558
If you're just here to have a little fun,
I mean, we'll do that, you know?

522
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:41,035
But Madi's keeps insisting,
you know, "I'm gonna be great."

523
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,130
Okay. Then, be great.

524
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,301
He picks out stuff that
he knows will piss her off.

525
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,742
Then when he does it,
it does piss her off...

526
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,438
which really is just so stupid.

527
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:54,006
No, you missin' those two
for shit-ass $5.50-an-hour job?

528
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,780
$6.75.
Please, Paul Come on, Paul.

529
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,220
I'll pay $6.75 just to
punch your mom in the face, all right?

530
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,053
Perfect example
is the Quaker rap thing...

531
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,095
which, prior to her being
found out by Rock School...

532
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,324
was something that she was
excited about and enjoyed.

533
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:11,868
I met these guys who are
the friendly gangsters.

534
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,999
It's just a bunch of guys that
got together five years ago

535
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,803
when they were all really young.

536
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,606
And they werejust, like,
"God, hymns suck so much."

537
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,875
And so, they started
rapping them outside.

538
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:30,443
And they're "Oh, whatever.
Raise your hands in the air. Oh, Jesus."

539
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,758
It actually all started
'cause there was this song...

540
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,796
I learned at a Quaker conference
called, "Come and Fill Me Up."

541
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,922
It's a modern Christian hymn...

542
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,560
but it has some pretty
blatant sexual undertones.

543
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,231
I've, like, rapped it before
just as a joke, so I was, like, all right.

544
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,331
We can do that. So we did it.

545
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,706
And everybody went wild for it.!

546
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,780
And we pulled out, like, a hymnal
and just ended up pulling out...

547
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,816
all these random Quaker hymns
that we all knew and just rapped 'em.

548
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,817
Everybody loved it.

549
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:06,879
And that was the year we
met "Sha-freaka," a.k.a. Madi.

550
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,527
When true
simplicity is gained

551
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:21,833
To bow, to bend
we shan't be ashamed

552
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:26,239
To turn, turn
It will be our delight

553
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:31,179
Just by turning, turning
we come 'round right

554
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,911
When true-

555
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,922
'Cause Madi's always busy, like, doin' her
Frank Zappa shit, and goin' to Germany.

556
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:47,020
See, I have this idea that
we should go to Germany with her.

557
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,395
And we could set up
on stage with them...

558
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,630
and just, like, refuse to stop playing
until Madi played a show with us.

559
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,831
But Madi said that wasn't a good idea.

560
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,773
Madi Diaz, she's out of the show.

561
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,010
Rock with the friendly gangsters.

562
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,910
Hello, Germany!

563
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,645
If you see an old lady
crossing the street

564
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:13,190
Give her a hand
Don't be rude

565
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,988
Now shejust thinks it's totally bogus
because he's made such fun of it, right?

566
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,324
She just thinks it's bullshit.
And that sucks.

567
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,920
I told her that the other day.

568
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,829
I said, "You know, Madilyn,
you've taken something-

569
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:25,458
You've let them take something
that you enjoyed and ruin it."

570
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,231
Saturday nights
we feed the poor

571
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,864
Sunday
we feed 'em some more

572
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:38,708
I want to utilize children's
learning ability...

573
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,909
while trying to
make them not be children.

574
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:44,886
You know what I mean? So the perfect
student is one who's still a child...

575
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,686
and still has that love and joy,
but somehow has a work ethic.

576
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:57,598
Only my class knows that
I'm pretty good at guitar.

577
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:03,538
They were like, "Wow, you should be
on Star Search or something."

578
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:07,236
For him, a lot of the times
I have to diffuse the pressure.

579
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,210
He puts pressure on himself
at school too.

580
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,338
He came home with
a "B" and he was distraught.

581
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,749
And I'm, like, "B's are okay.
You know, it's okay to have fun."

582
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,844
And sometimes he just thinks, "No."

583
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,220
These are things that he
needs to do in order to make it.

584
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,987
I actually am very much against...

585
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,622
kids "making it" at a certain age.

586
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,929
'Cause no one under the age of 17
has ever made any significant music...

587
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,060
or had a career after that.

588
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:37,630
I almost feel like what we do is,
is let them cut their teeth and have-

589
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:42,441
and simulate the music career...

590
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,879
while they wait to have
their heart really broken.

591
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,681
Is this what you want to do
with the rest of your life?

592
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,813
Yeah. Definitely.

593
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,321
The mirror's down here.
Come here, buddy.

594
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,264
You're crazy. Come here.
Look up. Look up.

595
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:08,336
There's really no other
way for me to do this.

596
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,373
We're going to-

597
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,408
We're going to be doing
a show called Black Sabbath.

598
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,740
It seems like it might be very hard.

599
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:19,009
- Not too heavy.
- Not too heavy, I promise.

600
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,876
There must be some
inherent gene in women...

601
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,785
that lets us be able to handle
the whole makeup thing.

602
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,358
'Cause the boys don't have it.

603
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:34,159
The two songs that I sing in it
is "Iron Man" and...

604
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,496
I also sing "Into the Void."

605
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,501
So sing "Into the Void" for me.

606
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,071
Rocket engines
burning fuel so fast

607
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,733
- Up into-
- No, that's not the point. With timing.

608
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:48,107
Rocket engines
burning fuel so fast

609
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:51,181
Up into the night sky
they blast

610
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,182
- Mom!
- Yes.

611
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,948
Can I have a cross
and my eyes look cool?

612
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,489
- Can you have a cross on your forehead?
- Yes.

613
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:04,186
- I want a pentagram.
- I'm not giving you a pentagram.

614
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,389
- A pentagram.
- I'm not giving you a pentagram.

615
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,365
Or a 666
or anything like that.

616
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,197
Tucker thinks he's done?

617
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,672
I just gotta write Ozzy on his knuckles,
and then we're done.

618
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,542
- What about those lines that go right there?
- I'm gonna put them on.

619
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:27,811
I probably need to get this sharpened,
though, to do the lines in the Z's.

620
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,115
- Yup. I know what you mean.
- You know what I mean?

621
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,150
I'm going to be playing a song-

622
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,321
playing one song on guitar
and it's called "Paranoid."

623
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,127
And it's gonna be
very hard, I think.

624
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,259
'Cause it's
a very fast song.

625
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,927
And I'm singing two songs.

626
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:50,165
One song is "Iron Man"
that me and Tucker both sing.

627
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:55,041
And the other song I sing is called
"Sweet Leaf" which is about pot.

628
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,479
Didn't realize

629
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,682
I can't forget you

630
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,458
For your surprise

631
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:19,400
You introduced me
to my mind

632
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:23,439
Asa, I'm about to spray
Aqua Net all over your hair.

633
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,876
I don't know.
Maybe I can get the front to stay up-

634
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,976
Mom, tell him when
he can open his-

635
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,829
This next hour and a half
is the most important time.

636
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:51,595
Now is the time we can do
the most damage or good to the show.

637
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,101
If you reallyjust focus
and go over last-minute details...

638
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,869
we can really hammer this
into a really good show.

639
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:05,074
I will make sure that you look
amazing up here tonight.

640
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,377
Tonight's not about rock and roll.
It's not about you guys.

641
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,044
It's not about me.
Tonight is about Satan. Okay?

642
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,247
Yeah!

643
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,153
To the glowing sun

644
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,056
Through the empires
of eternal void

645
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,028
Freedom from
the final suicide

646
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,826
On the seventh-

647
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,731
Look, look, look. When you're onstage-
When you're onstage...

648
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:27,770
I'll be sitting in the front, right?

649
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,931
You're gonna be nodding and doing
your whole thing, your little Ozzy bop.

650
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,566
Then when I go like this,
we're gonna sing together.

651
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,339
Rocket engines
burnin'fuel so fast

652
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,382
Up into the night sky
they blast

653
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:43,044
You're right on time.
Do you know what I mean?

654
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,849
You're in time with the music,
so you have it.

655
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,817
Guys, guys.
We can laugh at ourselves...

656
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,863
but now we're gonna play some Sabbath
and it's no laughing matter.

657
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:58,094
I love you guys. Whatever you do,
it's all right with me. We'll talk Monday.

658
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:01,569
When I say, go, we're gonna say,
"Six, six, eight, neighbor of the beast."

659
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:03,572
Okay?

660
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,733
Six, six, eight, neighbor of the beast.
One, two, three!

661
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,301
Six, six, eight,
neighbor of the beast!

662
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:12,905
These kids are really brave,
and I think they worked really hard.

663
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,247
I think they're a little scared tonight,
so I wanna give 'em a big hand...

664
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:20,517
just for havin' the guts and the diligence
to get up here and do this, okay?

665
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,999
Two, three, four.

666
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,170
All right, now!

667
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,412
Won't you listen

668
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,682
When I first met you

669
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,720
Didn't realize

670
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,796
I can't forget you

671
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,103
Yes. On the cymbals.

672
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,281
Finish with my woman

673
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:32,055
'Cause she couldn't help me
with my mind

674
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,130
People think I'm insane

675
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,598
Because I am frowning
all the time

676
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,476
Rocket engines
burning fuel so fast

677
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,145
Up into the night sky
they blast

678
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,917
Through the universe
the engines whine

679
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,492
Could it be the end
of man and time

680
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:39,721
Back on earth
the flame oflife burns low

681
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,424
Everywhere
is misery and woe

682
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,933
Pollution kills the air
the land and sea

683
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:48,129
Man prepares
to meet his destiny

684
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,277
You know when you know
you practiced enough?

685
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,147
When you can play your song
perfectly...

686
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:06,586
with a fuckin' World War III
going on around you.

687
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,887
And I don't care, 'cause hopefully
you'll practice in the future.

688
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:14,726
But you know what you guys did?
You let those guys see you sweat tonight.

689
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,823
And you never do that.

690
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,630
You let 'em see you sweat.

691
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:23,399
Okay? Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna play pretend.

692
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,408
We're gonna pretend
that the first set was a joke...

693
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,179
and we were just pretending
we were kids...

694
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,716
and pretending we didn't know
what amps we were plugged into...

695
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,876
or what microphones to use...

696
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:39,353
or where the smoke was coming from,
or what the lyrics are.

697
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:43,187
But guess what.
Nobody went home.

698
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,785
They want to be rocked tonight.

699
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:51,766
And we've got about one song
to show them we're not fuckin' around.

700
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,666
We're gonna do the songs too wild,
and they're gonna say...

701
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,238
"What the fuck was that first set?
Where did those kids go?

702
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,570
Who are these new kids?"
You hear me?

703
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,939
- Yeah.
- If you don't believe that, leave now.

704
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,171
If you think this is all a joke, leave now.
'Cause you know what I do?

705
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,771
I make really good musicians.
That's what I do for a living.

706
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,477
That's why I am who I am.
And I'll tell you how to do it.

707
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:12,783
Smile, fuck them, fuck you
and just play your songs.

708
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,290
If you mess up,
you meant to mess up.

709
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,485
Okay? Thank you.

710
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,474
Heavy boots oflead

711
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,211
Fills his victims full of dread

712
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,810
Running as fast as they can

713
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,915
Iron man lives again

714
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:03,990
Always been an ambitious person,
and, you know, wanna do special things.

715
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,592
I've always loved kids.
I've always loved teaching.

716
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,331
I mean, I'm just-
I teach all the time.

717
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:12,033
Can you sayJethro Tull?

718
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,406
Jethro Tull?

719
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,912
Watch this.

720
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:34,126
He likes it when Daddy
rocks the fat beats. Right?

721
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:41,369
November 20 of 2002,
I had a son-

722
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,462
Walden McKinley Green.

723
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:46,565
He's a very cool boy,
and in some sense has changed me.

724
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,473
Lisa wouldn't say so.

725
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,706
Lisa says I go on about my life
like nothing ever happened.

726
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:55,376
But I'll tell you. I mean, it makes-
It puts things in perspective, you know.

727
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:59,319
It's, like, the next step. You know,
I love kids, and now I have my own.

728
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:03,359
And now I have an excuse to
coach Little League in a couple years...

729
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,553
so it's not weird.

730
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,036
Good.

731
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:22,208
Classical music,
that's, like, a thing now.

732
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,475
You know, you play classical music
for your baby to make them really smart.

733
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,319
I really just think
it was so boring to him.

734
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,324
And then we put Frank Zappa
on one day...

735
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,485
and he was like-

736
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:43,032
he was, like, kicking his legs,
smiling and just laughing.

737
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:47,763
And he loves Frank Zappa,
which Paul's very happy about.

738
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,110
- All those acoustics-
- Extreme.

739
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:05,048
On a serious note, keep a little whatever-
whatever it is you do...

740
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:09,353
in your heart for C.J., who had
an operation yesterday on his leg.

741
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:14,089
He has a bone disorder, and his-
he was walking around for a month...

742
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:17,530
with his leg
out of his hip socket.

743
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,125
Yeah. And he can't come tonight,
he can't come tomorrow...

744
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,400
but he will be playing the show on Sunday,
but he has to sit down to play.

745
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,566
- Wow, that's great.
- C.J.

746
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,609
And maybe it'll be like
the start of a tradition...

747
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,645
and he'll be, like,
a sit-down guitar player.

748
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,737
Can anybody name
a sit-down guitar player?

749
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,056
- Yeah, C.J.!
- C.J.!

750
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:48,228
Bottom left. Bottom left. Bottom left.
That's right, right there.

751
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,164
I was thinking about it...

752
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,532
and do I really wanna do this?

753
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,936
But I knew my dream was to,
like, be a rock star, you know.

754
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,476
It was like- I mean, I was thinking
I might not wanna do this...

755
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,477
but I think I'm gonna have to.

756
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,706
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. C.J. Tywoniak.

757
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:09,947
Fresh from an operation
on his legs... three days ago?

758
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,283
- Friday, right? Last Thursday?
- Yeah.

759
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,790
Then he told the doctor he would wait
unless he could play the show tonight.

760
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,826
So, let's give him a big hand.

761
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:24,124
The thing I tell the kids
a lot lately is...

762
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,193
in one sense, music is
the most selfish act.

763
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,205
But if you can actually
get up there and play music...

764
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,400
and make people smile,
there's nothing like that.

765
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:36,878
And if I create kids who go out there
and play music selfishly...

766
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,849
and in spite of themselves and
make other people happy by doing that...

767
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,886
and make themselves happy...

768
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,319
and understand that when
you'rejust playing music...

769
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,653
to create music,
you're at your best...

770
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,726
that's enough.

771
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,956
Let me tell you something else.
I'm gonna be a jerk for a minute.

772
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,335
The Philly Enquirer
is coming in here tomorrow.

773
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:01,904
They're gonna come a few times.

774
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,439
They're gonna write a story
in the Sunday Magazine.

775
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,702
Okay? About me.

776
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,541
The circulation of the Sunday Enquirer
is like two million people.

777
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,673
I'm gonna have
a million new students.

778
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:18,743
Okay? You know what that means?
Apocalypse for most of you.

779
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,823
It's the end, motherfuckers.

780
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,825
Basically, I got a call
out of the blue one day...

781
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,725
Melissa Dribben,
Philadelphia Enquirer.

782
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:31,028
They wanna do an article, so, you know,
I had her come in and you know...

783
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,659
maybe as this movie will show,
I'm not that good at editing myself...

784
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,763
when people with pens
and recording devices are around.

785
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,536
I met the lady
that wrote the article...

786
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:45,980
and she was... fucking weird in the head.

787
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,919
First of all, I mean, it was written
with the composition of a fourth grader...

788
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,853
rambling and outright long.

789
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,619
She misquoted me, created the quote.

790
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:00,856
Also, she called me a sad Eeyore
of Rock School, which was okay.

791
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,865
But the major underlying point
of the article...

792
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:09,530
and what struck a chord with my mother...
is that there was-

793
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,130
It outright said that
there was a Will O'Connor Award...

794
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,143
for the kid most likely to kill himself.

795
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:18,641
Why is it the Will O'Connor Award?

796
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,376
Because when you meet Will O'Connor,
he says, "Hi. My name's Paul Green."

797
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,942
I'm Paul Green. He says, "Hi. My name's
Will I tried to kill myself three times."

798
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,955
And then he tells the stories,
and they're funny stories.

799
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,048
And if they're funny to him,
they're okay to me.

800
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,651
When Paul does it, it's all right, because
it's in the close quarters of Rock School.

801
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,822
And my parents
certainly didn't know about it.

802
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,901
They kinda think
Paul's an immature child.

803
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,904
He really needs to be more of an adult
in the way he handles his business.

804
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,497
They call him a Peter Pan.
He likes to appeal to children.

805
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,098
He never wants to grow up.

806
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,077
He can't be an adult in real society,
so he surrounds himself with children...

807
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,807
where he can be the hero.

808
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,749
He said, "My mom's not gonna pay for lessons.
She's furious and thinking of suing you."

809
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:01,347
It took a lot of doing and work
for her not to get a lawyer on my part.

810
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,894
In fact, the irony is
is that since Will joined Rock School...

811
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,360
all chance of him attempting
suicide pretty much ran out the door...

812
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:10,399
because in this place
he found, you know, it's a breeding-

813
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,095
Not a breeding ground. It's a meeting
place for misfits of all shape and sizes.

814
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,404
No. No "Purple Rain."

815
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,037
- "Purple Daze."
- No "Purple Rain," no.

816
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,946
Why don't you fuckin' do the songs
you don't know? No "Purple Rain."

817
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,679
- Paul, what do you want me to do?
- I want you to know the song!

818
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,880
- I know the song.
- I want you to know the keyboard!

819
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:35,116
Get people in your songs together...

820
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,090
and teach them so you
are all playing the same parts.

821
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,718
I want people to understand when they
sound good and listen to their own parts...

822
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,763
and have some fuckin' pride
in this shit.

823
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,732
That's a mess.
Don't fuckin' shake your head.

824
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:48,235
He'll bash heads with me a lot,
you know, around other people.

825
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:52,707
But when it's just the two of us,
or like three of us hanging out...

826
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,004
you know, me and, like, one other person
and Paul, he'll tell me...

827
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,011
you know, like,
you know I don't hate you.

828
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:59,206
Did you ever get together
with the people on this song once?

829
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,215
- Yes, I did.
- How come they don't know how it goes?

830
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:03,945
I don't know, Paul. 'Cause they don't know
how to play their instruments maybe.

831
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,419
Oh, and you're so fuckin' hot.
All right?

832
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,491
I don't know, Paul.
What do you want me to do?

833
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,287
I want you to get the people
and have them learn their songs!

834
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,884
I'm doing everything I can.

835
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,521
That's what I've been saying
since the beginning!

836
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,532
You weren't even playing
the right parts.

837
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:19,431
I kept cuing you,
and you wouldn't play it.

838
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:22,528
Madi would have been
out ofhere a long time ago...

839
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,869
if I didn't feel I had something to
teach her and owed it to her to teach her.

840
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:28,808
So, the net loss
that she brings to my program...

841
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,904
I mean, really, as far as
morale and sort of influence...

842
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:35,644
is disregarded because I really feel
like Madi is an extraordinary talent.

843
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,242
That's what I've been saying.

844
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,787
Bullshit. Ask Lee if I've talked
to her once this whole time.

845
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,824
- This rehearsal!
- Goddamn it. Bite my ass.

846
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,261
All right.
Why aren't you working?

847
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:50,560
I gave you a new song.
Why aren't you working with people?

848
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,370
It gets mixed up sometimes.
Sometimes my friends say...

849
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,635
"You're talking to me like you talk
to the kids." I do that sometimes.

850
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:04,736
But Paul Green, the dude,
is a simple guy.

851
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:08,875
You know, he likes-
You know, I mean-

852
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,352
When I am able to leave work behind,
I go home.

853
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,355
I like, you know, watching movies.

854
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:17,984
I like watching basketball.
I like making a fire.

855
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,996
You know, it's like
I tell the kids about performing...

856
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:25,829
it's a lot of me...
is performing, you know.

857
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,835
I mean, sometimes I'm really mad.

858
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,872
And then sometimes I'm just faking it
to get people's attention.

859
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:34,341
I kinda have, you know,
I kinda play both sides...

860
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,277
because, you know, as a 12-year-old,
I was the nerdy little kid.

861
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,780
And then as a 16-year-old,
I was kind of the cool guy guitar player.

862
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:43,717
So I kind of have a little bit of both,
but with the fat bald guy mixed in.

863
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:49,486
On the other hand, these kids are literally
part of something that's the best.

864
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,083
Not the only, but the best
of its kind, you know.

865
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,687
There's very, very few times
where you get to be the best in life.

866
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,562
And I know my ego's as big
as the whole universe.

867
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,865
If I couldn't be the best guitar player,
I've invented something new...

868
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:04,565
so I could be the best at it.

869
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,513
Do it! Yeah!

870
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,805
Girl, you really got me now

871
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:41,536
You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin'

872
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,112
Girl, you really got me now

873
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:48,240
You got me so I can't sleep at night

874
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,819
Girl, you really got me now

875
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,151
You got me so I don't know
where I'm goin', yeah

876
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,420
Oh, yeah
You really got me now

877
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,586
You got me so I can't sleep
at night

878
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:04,963
You really got me. You really got me
You really got me

879
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,771
Please, don't ever let me be

880
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:15,003
I only wanna be by your side

881
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,579
Please, don't ever let me be

882
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,513
I only wanna be by your side

883
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,211
Girl, you really got me now

884
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,619
You got me so I don't know
where I'm goin', yeah

885
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:30,784
Oh, yeah
You really got me now

886
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,952
You got me so I can't sleep at night

887
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:37,965
You really got me. You really got me
You really got me

888
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,366
Oh, no, no, no

889
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,898
Girl, you really got me now

890
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,935
You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin'

891
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,495
Ow.! Girl, you really
got me now

892
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:20,007
You got me so I can't sleep
at night

893
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,204
Girl, you really got me now

894
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,680
You got me so I don't know
what I'm doin', yeah

895
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:31,015
Oh, yeah
you really got me now

896
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,054
You got me so I can't sleep at night

897
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:38,219
You really got me. You really got me
You really got me

898
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:54,205
C.J. Will be signing
autographs in the lounge...

899
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,278
five dollars each
after the show.

900
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,842
I think the show's awesome.

901
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:05,079
I think C.J.'s awesome.

902
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:10,582
I don't care, like,
ber musicians, you know.

903
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:15,255
And not, you know, not at the expense
of the happiness of the kid.

904
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:19,164
I think there's a true happiness...

905
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:23,136
that comes with the confidence
of being that creative...

906
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,799
and exceptional.

907
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,308
That is, you know, it's sublime.

908
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:32,040
And so at the same time, not like-
I don't wanna create, like...

909
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:34,048
miserable geniuses.

910
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,243
I wanna create,
you know, happy geniuses.

911
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,719
Be yourself! Big!

912
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:44,224
Wait, wait. Wait!

913
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,932
Beat!

914
01:02:56,038 --> 01:03:01,738
Wanna set you free
I need you here by me because

915
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:03,869
Rock School's really built
in the hierarchy.

916
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,211
And the way it's supposed
to be looked at, the hierarchy...

917
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,409
is you strive to be that good.

918
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,386
But often times
it's very disillusioning...

919
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:15,286
when you try
and you're not that good.

920
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:19,794
And you don't-And it's not even feasible
for you to be that good.

921
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,421
And you kinda get-
I just feel that there's a lot of kids...

922
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:26,298
that kinda get lost
in the web that is Rock School.

923
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,105
It's how it ends.

924
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,915
Mike! What the fuck!

925
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:45,453
What the fuck are you learn-
What the fuck!

926
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,218
With the guitar going-

927
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:57,197
That is how it ends,
but that wasn't the ending!

928
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,495
If you guys can reasonably
get through the song...

929
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:02,469
meaning don't stop the song
before it's over-

930
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,540
I realize I made a mistake.

931
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,007
Just realizing you made
a mistake is not enough!

932
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:12,137
Don't fuckin' make mistakes!
Not on "Rebel Yell."

933
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,216
Okay.

934
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,376
I've got- Come here.

935
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:20,649
I have to deal with this, okay?

936
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:25,318
This I have to worry about.
I should not have to worry about you.

937
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,328
- Okay.
- Understand?

938
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:30,695
This is waiting for me to see how
his song's going. How are your songs?

939
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,791
- Good.
- No, they're not.

940
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,893
Kids don't always strive for the best...

941
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:38,030
and Paul thinks his tactics
work best over everything.

942
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,632
And brute force
and shrieking at children...

943
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,975
is always the best route
to get them to practice.

944
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:48,016
I actually had a really long speech
with the kids the other night.

945
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:51,609
And what I told them was, you know,
they're not my friends.

946
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,246
And I understand that
and never expected them to be, you know.

947
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,450
I mean, they don't even
understand what friendship is.

948
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,356
I know I'm a big fat jerk, all right?

949
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,361
I know. I know I am. I know.

950
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,658
I have to get up and look at myself
in the mirror every day.

951
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:06,997
I don't see fuckin' Eric Svalgard
in the mirror. I see me.

952
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:11,870
Okay? But I also know the couple times
I'm trying not to be a big fat jerk...

953
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:15,808
you kids are horrible, you're evil,
you're manipulative little fucks.

954
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,846
I'm their friend.

955
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:20,279
And, you know, there's not a kid
in the school who won't...

956
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,682
when the chips are on the table,
choose their peers...

957
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:25,947
and this sounds weird,
but their parents...

958
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:29,786
or an easy way out over me.

959
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:33,828
You know, as much as I do and all that.
You understand, it's just what kids are.

960
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,728
So kids will put the knife right in,
and that's fine.

961
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:40,324
I mean, if I was sensitive about that,
I'd be in the wrong business.

962
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,928
But, at the same time, I have
a deep affection for many of these kids.

963
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,771
'Cause you can't do this job
without investing yourself in the kids.

964
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,868
Christ.

965
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,881
It has to be on a 45-degree angle
pointing in...

966
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,252
'cause we have square tips here.

967
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,793
But they come in other fashions.

968
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:08,057
I feel I felt more solace
and more contention in music...

969
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,064
in the music I chose
to listen to...

970
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:14,626
not the music Paul felt I should
and that Paul felt I should learn.

971
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:18,969
Though learning it helped me, to some
extent, to become a better musician...

972
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:24,342
which is, I suppose,
the underlying purpose of it all.

973
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:32,452
Me and Paul parted ways
on the best possible terms.

974
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:36,286
I mean, I cried almost
a little bit kind of, but not really...

975
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,860
and I don't wanna talk about it
in that sense.

976
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:42,624
But Paul was very respectful.
He just approached me...

977
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,565
and he was, like, "Do you wanna be
in Rock School anymore?"

978
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,160
And I guess it was more of, like,
that was his way of saying...

979
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:52,263
"You're not paying,
you don't wanna work...

980
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,502
and you're not gonna get good."

981
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,806
Maybe Paul honestly saw me
as a lost kid...

982
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,816
and that he felt like
he should give me help...

983
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:06,115
'cause I was a pretty fucked-up kid.

984
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,315
So, I mean, do you- do you miss it?

985
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,891
Do I?

986
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:17,063
I do, but not to the extent
that I'd ever go back.

987
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,464
I feel like that part
of my life is over.

988
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,699
One, two, three.

989
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:29,810
One, t- Listen to me.
One, two, three, four.

990
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:33,211
There it is. Okay?
It's not on four. It's on four and.

991
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,284
One, two, three, four.

992
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,582
No! Why are you hitting that
before the song?

993
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:43,886
This is my, on so many levels,
was sort of my little reward.

994
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:49,124
One, two, three, four.

995
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,893
And now this is sort of
the end point.

996
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:55,300
This is, "Look at the work
I've done with these kids."

997
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,396
Sing it into the mike!
Sing into the mike!

998
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,509
That's not an unimportant
part of the song.

999
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,340
That's the shining moment.
Who told you not to play that?

1000
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:07,280
Everyone's sick
of keyboard girls over there.

1001
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:10,841
We gotta raise the ante.
We're going to Germany.

1002
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,285
And, you know, I get to
put them on stage...

1003
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:16,756
in front of people who know
and understand this music.

1004
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,828
And I have a feeling that
we're gonna be the best act there.

1005
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:56,952
We just find that bottle.
We were walking around-

1006
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:59,994
Am I, like, burping out on my bed?

1007
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:01,960
- No, not really.
- You sure?

1008
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:04,965
Okay, fact number one:
Bad Doberan's already packed.

1009
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:06,967
There's gonna be tons of people
at this festival.

1010
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,299
Fact number two:
We have other people on the schedule.

1011
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,669
People are like, "Who?"
We're playing right after Ike Willis.

1012
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,572
And we're playing right before
Napoleon Murphy-Brock and all this stuff.

1013
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:18,408
And I just ran into some English guys
downtown, who were, like, practicing.

1014
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,573
And I was like, "Oh, hey,
I'm doing the festival too."

1015
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,651
They're like, "Oh, whatever."
And I was like, "Where's the"-

1016
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,686
'Cause I knew the office with someone.
They're like, "It's around here somewhere."

1017
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:29,781
Disrespect, okay?
They're disrespecting you guys.

1018
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,988
I'm dead serious.
We have to fuckin' destroy everybody.

1019
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,963
We have to destroy them like we
destroyed the Germans in World War I.

1020
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:40,365
Like we destroyed the Germans
in World War II.

1021
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:41,993
Okay?

1022
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:46,132
And like we run their economy now.
Okay, anyway.

1023
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,580
Anyway, listen. We've had fun.

1024
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:58,312
We're gonna get out. When we
wake up tomorrow, it's work, okay?

1025
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:02,083
It is work. You guys are gonna practice
for three hours tomorrow.

1026
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:04,489
You're gonna practice
for three hours on Saturday.

1027
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,618
And you're gonna do nothing
but warm up on Sunday. All right?

1028
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,196
There is no excuses, okay?

1029
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:11,323
You're gonna work on some
vocal harmonies with Lauren.

1030
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,458
- I got some.
- Okay. You're gonna just-

1031
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:17,061
Like sometimes you nail those parts
of"Inca Roads," sometimes you don't.

1032
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,970
You're gonna just have to guarantee.
You know what I'm saying?

1033
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:22,703
We pull off"Inca Roads"- I wanted to
end with it, but I'm not quite-

1034
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,972
So, I moved it earlier in the set.

1035
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,378
But we pull "Inca Roads" off, everybody,
the crowd is just gonna go nuts.

1036
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:30,145
- No, we'll work on it.
- If we're just good...

1037
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,516
if we're just amazing,
it ain't gonna happen.

1038
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,454
We have to be the best band
at Zappanale.

1039
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,652
Hey, oh

1040
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,390
Throw your hands in the air
and wave 'em like you just don't care

1041
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:54,333
And if you think that we're gonna rock
somebody say, "Oh, yeah"

1042
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:56,631
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey

1043
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,539
Guys?
Somebody say, "Oh, yeah"

1044
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:04,578
- Oh, yeah.
- Good morning

1045
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,978
Rise and shine

1046
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:10,074
Let's go wake the ladies up.

1047
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,422
Everybody decent?

1048
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,990
Good morning
It's your birthday

1049
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,428
We're gonna party
like it's your birthday

1050
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,761
Who wants to rock
Oh, yeah

1051
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,336
Stop. Oh, God.

1052
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,642
There's all these people
that like Zappa and all this shit.

1053
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,241
I don't wanna, like,
mess it up and everything.

1054
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,615
We have too much
on our shoulders.

1055
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:58,696
I just hope people show up
to the show.

1056
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:02,362
And I hope we don't screw up,
'cause they all know Zappa material.

1057
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:07,374
It's not-We don't play late enough
for everyone to be drunk and not care.

1058
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:10,036
That's how I feel.

1059
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:22,279
- So, come on. Let's do this.
- All right.

1060
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,856
As far as the kids go,
I met them in Philadelphia.

1061
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:31,626
I was on tour
with Project/Object last year.

1062
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:36,727
When we got to Philadelphia, they said,
"Oh, here's this guy named Paul Green...

1063
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:39,535
with these kids,
and they play Frank Zappa music.

1064
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,973
And they're from
the age of nine to 17."

1065
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,637
And I went, "And they do what?"

1066
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:47,806
"Yeah, they play Frank Zappa music."
"Oh, really? Which songs do they play?"

1067
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:51,477
And they gave us a list of the songs,
and I went, "No, they don't play that."

1068
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,351
- Good.
- One, two, three, four.

1069
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:02,961
And all I can say about
the effect that it had on us...

1070
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:06,364
is that, you know, we could have
captured a lot of flies in our mouth...

1071
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:09,301
because we stood there
and listened to them like this.

1072
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,002
I know what I had to go through
to learn those songs.

1073
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:22,573
And for them to learn them and be able to
perform them at the level that they do...

1074
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,584
you know, it's quite inspiring.

1075
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:28,281
And yes, I think it will be
an historical event...

1076
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:32,724
that I play with them
on "Inca Roads" of all songs.

1077
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:50,808
It helps me understand
a lot of what I did with Frank on the-

1078
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:52,813
on the albums that I did.

1079
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,713
It helps me to understand,
you know...

1080
01:15:55,817 --> 01:16:00,345
why I had intuitions
to do it a certain way...

1081
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:05,620
or why, you know, I had such a level
of tenacity and, you know, intensity.

1082
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:09,993
Because I was preparing
teaching tools for them.

1083
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:12,396
But we didn't know it
at the time.

1084
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:16,938
But when I saw them, and I went,
like, "Oh, that's why. Now I understand."

1085
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,271
On Ruth, on Ruth
Ha, ha, that's Ruth

1086
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,177
I think we got a winner.

1087
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:30,344
Okay, what's gonna happen, as soon as
we break here and these guys start playing...

1088
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:32,750
we're gonna get all the gear
right by there, okay?

1089
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:38,256
On "Inca Roads,"
we're gonna do the opposite thing.

1090
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:42,023
We're gonna put the saxophone
on the left side.

1091
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:46,501
You're out of tune,
your song gets cut, okay?

1092
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:52,963
Okay, keyboard players,
don't turn down during your solos.

1093
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,206
Play with distortion.

1094
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:58,370
You always play with distortion.
Play with distortion.

1095
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:03,616
One, two, three. Okay?

1096
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:09,854
- How many guitars are there?
- I already went through this. Two.

1097
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,589
Don't just be dumb when you're not-

1098
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:17,494
Do something
when you're not playing, okay?

1099
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,459
With Mike's drum solo
ending with a flourish of some type...

1100
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:25,836
I will count off
one, two, three, four.

1101
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:43,355
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Paul Green School of Rock...

1102
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,052
from Philadelphia.

1103
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:08,672
Three hundred years ago
I thought I might get some sleep

1104
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:11,685
I stretched myself out
on an antique bed

1105
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:14,381
And my spirit
did a midnight creep

1106
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:17,458
You know I'll never
sleep no more

1107
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:24,195
It seemed to me
like itjust ain't wise

1108
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,764
Did you ever wake up
in the morning

1109
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:32,806
With a Zomby Woof
behind your eyes

1110
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,705
Just about as evil
as you could be

1111
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,730
I am the Zomby Woof

1112
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:05,603
I'm the creature
all the ladies been talkin'about

1113
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:09,805
I am the Zomby Woof

1114
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:14,848
They all seek for shelter
when I come chargin'out

1115
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:18,509
Tellin'you all the Zomby troof

1116
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:23,523
Here am is the Zomby Woof

1117
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,556
Tellin'you all the Zomby troof

1118
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:31,098
Here am is

1119
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:03,053
All together now!
Let's go!

1120
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:52,100
Did a vehicle come from
somewhere out there

1121
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:55,167
Just to land in the Andes

1122
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,971
Was it round
and did it have

1123
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,606
A motor

1124
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:07,848
Or was it something different

1125
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:10,791
Sure was something different.

1126
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:12,917
I ain't never seen nothing
like this in my entire life.

1127
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:15,121
- Why'd you go sharpen it?
- Whose python boots are those anyway?

1128
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:42,714
On Ruth, on Ruth
Ha, ha, that's Ruth

1129
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:49,249
Let's hear it
for the School of Rock.

1130
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:41,737
It feels pretty good.

1131
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:43,777
Yeah. Was it first time
you was in concert?

1132
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:47,143
Oh, yeah.
It was my first time.

1133
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,846
I can't tell you
how much I enjoyed that, man.

1134
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:55,451
And the work that you're doing...

1135
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:58,185
- I hope you continue with this, man.
- Yes.

1136
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:01,160
They're phenomenal.

1137
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,628
Thoroughly enjoyable.

1138
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:08,428
And they chose some of the hardest music
in the world to learn.

1139
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:10,629
It doesn't get
any better than that.

1140
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:15,266
You get me to my knees,
hey, that's it.

1141
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:19,312
That's everything.
It brought me to my knees.

1142
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:21,678
God bless every one of them.

1143
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,445
The greatest success of my life.

1144
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,645
Right there-
Oh, my baby-

1145
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:30,713
Then the greatest success
of my life.

1146
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,107
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1147
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:52,111
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1148
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:56,616
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1149
01:25:56,718 --> 01:26:00,210
Thank you. Thank you.
God bless you all.

1150
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:01,845
Good night.

1151
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:08,561
Thanks, everybody.
Good night.

1152
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,097
Thanks, Paul.
You're the man.

1153
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:15,192
Thank you. Most of us or some of us
will be back next year.

1154
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:18,602
We will see you.
Thanks to Wolfheart, Jim Cohen-

1155
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:33,343
Rock School is many things
to many people.

1156
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:36,218
And to me,
it was a life-changing event.

1157
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,952
Oh, I don't like that.
Let me try again.

1158
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:42,120
My dream is still to be a rock star.

1159
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,824
I wanna be, like, a legend.

1160
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:50,565
And as far as
coming to that- to that goal...

1161
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:56,577
I have to say
I just got a little bit closer.

1162
01:26:56,678 --> 01:26:58,805
Paul is not Rock School.

1163
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,541
Rock School is bigger than Paul.

1164
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,445
And I think he knows it.

1165
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:06,813
No, I don't like that.

1166
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:10,550
This is gonna sound cheesy,
but, you know, you can do anything.

1167
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:18,022
I didn't think I could play
half of the riffs that I can play.

1168
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:22,125
When I first got here I was fucking
playing Sheryl Crow, you know.

1169
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:26,071
I was strumming open "D" chords
and, you know...

1170
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:28,267
Paul taught me that, you know...

1171
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:30,936
I could think about things and
figure things out for myself.

1172
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:33,343
Not just, you know,
like the normal songs.

1173
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,313
I can figure Zappa out, you know.

1174
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,079
I could play this shit and make it sound
like it's supposed to be played.

1175
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:42,987
I wouldn't say it was a learning thing
so much as it was an experience.

1176
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,618
Something that I will always remember is,
like, my youth and things like that.

1177
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:49,288
And the friendships
I've made there are lasting.

1178
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:53,527
And as a social misfit, that's been
very crucial to my development.

1179
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:57,162
I just, you know, I hope
it was a great experience, you know.

1180
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:02,437
I hope, and I hope they see
that life can be more than...

1181
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:05,979
you know, whatever, you know.

1182
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:10,244
I hope they can see that they're capable
of amazing things.

1183
01:28:10,351 --> 01:28:13,912
And that, you know,
really are, you know-

1184
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,512
I don't mean to be cheesy...

1185
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:18,456
but our humanity
is tied up in things like playing music.

1186
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:21,027
That's where our humanity is.
That's why we're not chimps.

1187
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,394
I wouldn't mind being a chimp,
but we are human.

1188
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:29,027
So, you know, like I always say,
if you major in the humanities-

1189
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:33,471
The humanities are philosophy
and poetry and literature and music.

1190
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,804
And that's what makes us human.

1191
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:40,040
And to hone our crafts
is to hone our humanity, you know.

1192
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,844
And hopefully
they'll continue to do that.

1193
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:51,383
If I was giving you guys
the opportunity to end the movie...

1194
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:55,121
by saying one-
anything you guys wanted to say...

1195
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:57,424
it could be about Rock School,
it could be about anything...

1196
01:28:57,532 --> 01:29:00,558
this would be the last thing
after you watch the whole movie...

1197
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:03,296
you guys would be up there
as the last people on the screen...

1198
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:07,363
- what would you say?
- Look at the camera and say it. Lean in.

1199
01:29:07,475 --> 01:29:09,033
Tell the American audience

1200
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,839
what you want them to know
about Rock School.

1201
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:17,816
- If Don gave me- gave me a chance-
- Tucker and I.

1202
01:29:17,919 --> 01:29:22,049
If Don gave Tucker and I
a chance to say the last thing...

1203
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:25,717
in the end of- of the movie...

1204
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:31,322
I would say "Party on."

1205
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:35,528
If Don gave- gave me a chance...

1206
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:40,335
to be the last person
in the documentary on Rock School...

1207
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:44,138
I'd say "Long live rock."

1208
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,413
Well, we got no choice

1209
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:25,611
All you girls and boys

1210
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:29,315
Making all that noise

1211
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:33,087
'Cause they found new toys

1212
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,958
Well, we can't salute you
Can't find a flag

1213
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:39,328
If that don't suit ya
that's a drag

1214
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:43,837
School's out for summer

1215
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:46,304
Yeah

1216
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:50,503
School's out forever

1217
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:57,114
School's been blown
to pieces

1218
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,687
No more pencils

1219
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:12,595
No more books

1220
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,636
No more teacher's

1221
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:18,898
Dirty looks

1222
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:21,873
Oh, yeah

1223
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:25,673
If it's good, I will change my attitude,
and we'll do an hour of solid-

1224
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,510
If it's bad, we all
come right back in this room-

1225
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:29,583
Paul, but don't be-

1226
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:32,312
And I tell the story of how
I lost my virginity, okay?

1227
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:38,918
And it wasn't-
it wasn't a nice story.

1228
01:31:39,026 --> 01:31:41,187
It wasn't a nice story.

1229
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:44,753
- It smelled like nicotine and-
- Ahh! Stop!

1230
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:46,834
- Whale oil.
- Stop.

1231
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:50,563
School's out for summer

1232
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:53,071
Yeah

1233
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:57,440
School's out forever

1234
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:05,218
School's been blown
to pieces

1235
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,847
No more pencils

1236
01:32:09,957 --> 01:32:13,393
No more books

1237
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:17,191
No more teacher's

1238
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:20,790
Dirty looks

1239
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:23,598
Out for summer

1240
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:27,037
Out till fall

1241
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:34,047
We might not
come back at all

1242
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:38,244
School's out forever

1243
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:45,051
School's out for summer

1244
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:51,588
School's out with fever

1245
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:59,505
My school's out completely

1246
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,474
My life would probably
be really boring...

1247
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,102
if I wasn't in Rock School.

1248
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:08,670
Rock School is, like, probably
my favorite place in the entire world.

1249
01:33:15,556 --> 01:33:17,456
Hottest band in town.

1250
01:33:18,305 --> 01:33:24,924
