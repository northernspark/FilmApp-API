00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:26,348
Two households,
both alike in dignity,

3
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:31,030
In fair Verona,
where we lay our scene,

4
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,432
From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,

5
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:42,000
Where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

6
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:47,475
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes

7
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:53,357
A pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life;

8
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:58,398
Whose misadventured
piteous overthrows

9
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,441
Do, with their death,
bury their parents' strife.

10
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,400
But the quarrel is between
our masters and us their men.

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,509
'Tis all one.

12
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,830
Here come the house
of the Montagues.

13
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:38,871
Good morrow.

14
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:40,652
Good morrow to you, sir.

15
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:43,573
Quarrel! I will back thee.

16
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,893
Right.

17
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,334
Fear me not.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,173
Come. Let's on.

19
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:59,500
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

20
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:02,698
I do bite my thumb, sir.

21
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
Look at them.

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,896
No, sir, I do not bite my
thumb at you, sir;

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,723
but I do bite my thumb, sir.

25
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,242
Do you quarrel, sir?

26
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,435
Quarrel, sir? No, sir.

27
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,712
If you do, sir, I am for you.

28
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,530
I serve as good a man as you.

29
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:26,688
No better.

30
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:28,313
Yes, better, sir.

31
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,458
You lie.

32
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:48,481
Draw!

33
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:50,031
Draw, if you be men!

34
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,171
Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow.

35
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,311
Kill the Capulets!

36
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:15,000
Part, fools!
Put up your swords.

37
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,800
You know not what you do.

38
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:18,764
The prince hath
expressly forbid

39
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:20,157
this bandying
in Verona streets.

40
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,834
Here come the Capulets!

41
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,300
Tybalt, Capulet's kinsman.

42
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:39,720
What, art thou drawn among
these heartless hinds?

43
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,350
Turn thee, Benvolio,
look upon thy death.

44
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:46,970
I do but keep the peace.

45
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:48,000
Put up thy sword,

46
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,767
or manage it
to part these men with me.

47
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,140
What, drawn,
and talk of peace?

48
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,000
I hate the word

49
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,300
as I hate hell,
all Montagues, and thee.

50
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,461
Have at thee, coward!

51
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,500
Capulet!

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,330
Montague!

53
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,381
Now hie thee home, fragment!

54
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,205
Villain!

55
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,983
Capulet!

56
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,700
Give me my long sword, ho!

57
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,000
Capulet!

58
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,100
Down to the market square!

59
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Capulet!

60
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:41,192
Follow me! Follow me!

61
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:44,000
Kill that villain Montague!

62
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:49,714
My noble uncle!
My noble uncle!

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
What?

64
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,807
My sword! My sword!

65
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,129
Thou shalt not stir
a foot to seek a foe.

66
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,615
Hold me not, let me go.

67
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,000
Montague!

68
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,888
Kill the villain Capulet!

69
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,113
The prince!

70
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:52,789
The prince is coming!
Put down your weapons!

71
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:53,900
The prince!

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The prince!

73
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,081
Here comes the prince!

74
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:13,853
Rebellious subjects,
enemies to peace,

75
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,400
Throw your mistempered
weapons to the ground!

76
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,000
Down your weapons.
Down, I say.

77
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:23,326
And hear the sentence
of your moved prince.

78
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,500
Three civil brawls,
bred of an airy word

79
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,480
By thee, old Capulet...

80
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,380
No, no.

81
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,432
...and Montague,

82
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,880
Have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

83
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:49,767
If ever you disturb
our streets again,

84
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:54,102
Your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

85
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,956
For this time
all the rest depart away.

86
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:04,623
You, Capulet,
shall go along with me;

87
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,602
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.

88
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,500
Once more, on pain of death,

89
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,700
all men depart.

90
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,028
Where is Romeo?
Saw you him today?

91
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,015
Right glad I am
he was not at this fray.

92
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,351
Madam, an hour before
the worshipped sun

93
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,600
Peered forth the golden
window of the east,

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
A troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad;

95
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,000
Where, underneath
the grove of sycamore

96
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,244
So early walking
did I see your son.

97
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,885
Towards him I made;
but he was ware of me

98
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,765
And stole into
the covert of the wood.

99
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,435
Many a morning hath
he there been seen.

100
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,100
See, where he comes.

101
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,200
So please you, step aside,

102
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,530
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,455
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay

104
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,778
To hear true shrift.
Come, madam, let's away.

105
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,800
Good morrow, cousin.

106
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:11,700
Is the day so young?

107
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,500
But new struck nine.

108
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,200
Ay me!

109
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
Sad hours seem long.

110
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,300
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?

111
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,431
It was.

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,172
What sadness lengthens
Romeo's hours?

113
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,622
Not having that, which,
having, makes them short.

114
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,000
But, Romeo...

115
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,635
Farewell, coz.

116
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:05,000
God's me, what fray was here?

117
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:08,500
Yet tell me not,
for I have heard it all.

118
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:16,950
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

119
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,000
Soft! I will go along.

120
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,955
But Montague is bound
as well as I,

121
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:31,831
in penalty alike.

122
00:10:32,908 --> 00:10:34,372
And 'tis not hard, I think,

123
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:37,047
for men as old as we
to keep the peace.

124
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,422
Of honourable reckoning
are you both,

125
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:43,759
And pity 'tis you
lived at odds so long.

126
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,594
But... But now, my lord,

127
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:49,550
what say you to my suit?

128
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:52,388
But saying o'er what
I have said before:

129
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,620
My child is yet
a stranger in the world.

130
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,660
She hath not seen the change
of fourteen years.

131
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,730
Let two more summers
wither in their pride

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,700
Ere we may think her
ripe to be a bride.

133
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,489
Younger than she
are happy mothers made.

134
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,809
And too soon marred
are those so early made.

135
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,414
The earth hath swallowed
all my hopes but she,

136
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,409
She is the hopeful lady
of my earth.

137
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:32,500
But woo her, gentle
Paris, get her heart,

138
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,800
My will to her consent
is but a part.

139
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,209
Peter!

140
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
This night I hold
an old accustomed feast,

141
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,950
Whereto I have invited
many a guest,

142
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,400
Such as I love;
you among the store,

143
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:50,000
One more, most welcome,
makes my number more.

144
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,609
Nurse, where's my daughter?

145
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,299
Call her forth to me.

146
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,300
Now, by my maidenhead
at twelve years old,

147
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
I bade her come.
Where is the girl?

148
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,500
Juliet! Juliet!

149
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,261
Where is the girl? Juliet!

150
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:16,803
Where is the girl? Juliet!

151
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,328
How now, who calls?

152
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,290
Your mother,
your lady mother.

153
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:34,800
It's your mother,
your lady mother.

154
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,300
Make haste, girl. Make haste.

155
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,379
Where were you?

156
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:45,000
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

157
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,447
This is the matter.

158
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,780
Make haste, girls.
Come on, come on.

159
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:52,817
Nurse,

160
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,501
give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret.

161
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,500
Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.

162
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,900
Thou's hear our counsel.

163
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:10,800
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

164
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,850
I can tell her age
unto an hour.

165
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:14,000
She's not fourteen.

166
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,900
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth,

167
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,700
and yet, to my teen
be it spoken,

168
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,400
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.

169
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,400
How long is it now
to Lammastide?

170
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
A fortnight and odd days.

171
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,500
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,

172
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,400
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.

173
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,700
Susan and she,

174
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,500
God rest all Christian
souls, were of an age.

175
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,050
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.

176
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,474
But, as I said, on Lammas Eve

177
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:37,600
at night
shall she be fourteen.

178
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,094
That shall she, marry;
I remember it well.

179
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,800
My lord and you
were then at Mantua.

180
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,138
Nay, I do bear a brain.

181
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,900
For then she could
stand high lone;

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
nay, by the rood, she could
have run and waddled all about;

183
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,900
for even the day before,
she broke her brow;

184
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,015
and then my husband - God rest
his soul, he were a merry man -

185
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
took up the child.

186
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,009
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?

187
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;

188
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:06,450
wilt thou not, Jule?"

189
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,509
Nurse!

190
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,160
And, by my holidame,

191
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,300
the pretty wretch left
crying, and said: "Ay".

192
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,213
Enough of this.
I pray thee hold thy peace.

193
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,500
Yes, madam.

194
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,000
Now, Juliet.

195
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,177
God mark thee to his grace!

196
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,570
Thou wast the prettiest babe
that e'er I nurs'd.

197
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,800
An I might live to see
thee married once,

198
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,128
I have my wish.

199
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Marry, that "marry" is the
very theme I came to talk of.

200
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,978
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

201
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,853
how stands your disposition
to be married?

202
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
It is an honour
that I dream not of.

203
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,500
An honour? Were not I
thine only nurse,

204
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I would say thou hadst
sucked wisdom from thy teat.

205
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
Well, think of marriage now.

206
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,600
Younger than you, here in
Verona, ladies of esteem,

207
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,700
are made already mothers.

208
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,309
By my count,
I was your mother

209
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,658
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.

210
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Oh, yes, I remember.

211
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,135
Thus then in brief:

212
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,200
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.

213
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,300
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world.

214
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,800
Why, he's a man of wax.

215
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,200
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.

216
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,800
Nay, he's a flower...

217
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,895
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?

218
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,500
Madam! Madam!

219
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
The guests are come,
supper served up,

220
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,800
you called,
my young lady asked for...

221
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,400
We follow.

222
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,657
Speak briefly,
can you like of Paris' love?

223
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,292
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.

224
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,300
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,

225
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,209
Than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.

226
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,300
Juliet, the County stays.

227
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,010
Madam, I come.

228
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,928
Go, girl, seek happy nights
to happy days.

229
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,400
Give me a case
to put my visage in.

230
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
A visor for a visor!

231
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,578
What care I what curious eye
doth quote deformities?

232
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,059
Here are the beetle brows
shall blush for me.

233
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:56,626
What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?

234
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,100
Or shall we on
without apology?

235
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,332
The date is out
of such prolixity.

236
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,149
Let them measure us
by what they will.

237
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:04,296
We'll measure them
a measure, and be gone.

238
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:07,000
Come, knock and enter;
and no sooner in

239
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,659
but every man
betake him to his legs.

240
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,011
And we mean well, in
going to this mask;

241
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,258
but 'tis no wit to go.

242
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,013
Why, may one ask?

243
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,300
I dreamt a dream tonight.

244
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,900
And so did I.

245
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,600
Well, what was yours?

246
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:28,957
That dreamers often lie.

247
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,444
In bed asleep, while they
do dream things true.

248
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,938
O, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.

249
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,450
Queen Mab?

250
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,900
She is... She is
the fairies' midwife,

251
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,300
and she comes in state

252
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,000
no bigger than an agate stone

253
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,950
on the forefinger
of an alderman,

254
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,818
drawn with a team
of little atomies

255
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,500
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.

256
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,800
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinners' legs,

257
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,620
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;

258
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:10,953
the traces,
of the smallest spider's web;

259
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,630
and the collars, of the
moonshine's watery beams;

260
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,215
her whip, crack...

261
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,892
...is a cricket's bone;
the lash, of film.

262
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,359
And in this state

263
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,867
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,

264
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and then they dream of love.

265
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,538
O'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,

266
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,400
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,

267
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,200
because their breaths with

268
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,164
sweetmeats tainted are.

269
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,000
And sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,

270
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,294
tickling a parson's nose
as he lies asleep,

271
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,131
Then dreams he
of another benefice.

272
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,097
Amen.

273
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,613
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,

274
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,500
and then dreams he

275
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,

276
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,200
ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
drums in his ear,

277
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,400
at which he starts and wakes,

278
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,200
and being thus frighted
swears a prayer or two...

279
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,692
...and sleeps again.

280
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,000
This is that very Mab

281
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,010
that plats the manes
of horses in the night

282
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,336
and bakes the elflocks
in foul sluttish hairs,

283
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,500
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.

284
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,530
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,

285
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,800
that presses them
and learns them first to bear,

286
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,690
making them women
of good carriage.

287
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,213
This is she...

288
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,337
This is she that...

289
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,696
This... is she.

290
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,452
Peace, Mercutio, peace.

291
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,459
Thou talk'st of nothing.

292
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,569
Thou talk'st of nothing.

293
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,744
True.

294
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,586
True, I talk of dreams,

295
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,054
which are the children
of an idle brain,

296
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,848
begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;

297
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,857
which is as thin
of substance as the air,

298
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:37,200
and more inconstant
than the wind,

299
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:40,722
who wooes even now the
frozen bosom of the north,

300
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,968
and, being angered,
puffs away from thence,

301
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,493
turning his side
to the dew-dropping south.

302
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,890
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.

303
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,092
Strike, drum.
On, lusty gentlemen!

304
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,658
Romeo, we shall
arrive too late.

305
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,090
I fear too early;..

306
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,610
for my mind misgives

307
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,053
some consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,

308
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,212
shall bitterly begin

309
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,000
his fearful date
with this night's revels

310
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,313
and expire the term
of a despised life,

311
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,800
closed in my breast,

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,858
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death.

313
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,610
But he, that hath
the steerage of my course,

314
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,131
direct my sail!

315
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,831
Enter my poor house!
Welcome!

316
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,594
Oh, my lovely Helena,
my lovely niece!

317
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,017
Welcome all!

318
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,136
Be merry, gentlemen.
Be lively, ladies.

319
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,810
Welcome, gentlemen!

320
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,478
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor

321
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,749
and could tell a whispering
tale in a fair lady's ear,

322
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,300
such as would please.

323
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,552
'Tis gone, 'tis gone.
You are welcome, gentlemen!

324
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,410
Ladies!

325
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,619
She doth teach the torches
to burn bright!

326
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,490
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night

327
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,214
As a rich jewel
in an Ethiop's ear:

328
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,737
Beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

329
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,976
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows,

330
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,451
As yonder lady
o'er her fellows shows.

331
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:28,715
Did my heart love till now?

332
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:32,128
Forswear it, sight!

333
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:36,385
For I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.

334
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,400
This, by his voice,
should be a Montague.

335
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,336
Uncle, this is
a Montague, our foe.

336
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,778
A villain that is
hither come in spite,

337
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,652
To scorn at
our solemnity this night.

338
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,036
Young Romeo, is it?

339
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,498
Dares the slave come hither
covered in an antic face,

340
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,175
to fleer and scorn
at our solemnity?

341
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,053
He bears him like
a courtly gentleman;

342
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:10,719
and, to say truth,
Verona brags of him

343
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:12,539
to be a virtuous
and well-managed youth.

344
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,278
I would not for the wealth
of all this town

345
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,409
here in my house
do him disparagement.

346
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,715
Therefore have patience,
take no note of him.

347
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,493
The Moresca!

348
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,700
The Moresca!

349
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,093
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame!

350
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,700
Go to.

351
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,974
You are a saucy boy.

352
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,212
You'll make a mutiny
among my guests!

353
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,681
Am I the master here, or you?

354
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:04,500
I will not endure him.

355
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,455
You will not endure?
He shall be endured!

356
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,974
Or I know what!

357
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,090
Well said, my hearts!

358
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,995
You are a princox.

359
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:28,467
Be quiet, or...

360
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,130
For shame!
I'll make you quiet.

361
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,610
Leonardo will sing!

362
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,009
Leonardo, I pray thee, sing.

363
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:59,201
What is a youth?

364
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:03,148
Impetuous fire

365
00:30:03,444 --> 00:30:06,488
What is a maid?

366
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:09,556
Ice and desire

367
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:13,116
The world wags on

368
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:17,536
A rose will bloom

369
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:21,660
It then will fade

370
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:26,580
So does a youth

371
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:34,520
So does the fairest maid

372
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:37,788
Comes a time

373
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:40,128
When one sweet smile

374
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:44,707
Has its season for a while

375
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:50,371
Then love's in love with me

376
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,715
Some they think only to marry

377
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:57,271
Others will tease and tarry

378
00:30:57,567 --> 00:31:00,335
Mine is the very best parry

379
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:04,083
Cupid he rules us all

380
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:07,639
Caper the cape,
sing me the song

381
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:11,099
Death will come soon
to hush us along

382
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:14,559
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall

383
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:17,910
Love is a pastime
that never will pall

384
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,450
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall

385
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:27,414
Cupid he rules us all

386
00:31:45,962 --> 00:31:50,170
A rose will bloom

387
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:54,206
It then will fade

388
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:59,929
So does a youth

389
00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:09,525
So does the fairest maid

390
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,733
If I profane
with my unworthiest hand

391
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,816
This holy shrine,

392
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,813
the gentle sin is this:

393
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,089
My lips, two blushing
pilgrims, ready stand

394
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:33,611
To smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss.

395
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,073
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much,

396
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,757
Which mannerly devotion
shows in this;

397
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,818
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

398
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,418
And palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.

399
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,096
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?

400
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,339
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.

401
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,294
O, then, dear saint,

402
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,812
let lips do what hands do.

403
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,534
They pray, grant thou,

404
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,171
lest faith turn to despair.

405
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:40,187
Saints do not move,

406
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:41,507
though grant
for prayers' sake.

407
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:44,427
Then move not,

408
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:52,746
while my prayer's
effect I take.

409
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,313
Thus from my lips, by thine,

410
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,933
my sin is purged.

411
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,539
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.

412
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,709
Sin from my lips?

413
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,491
O trespass sweetly urged!

414
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,678
Give me my sin again.

415
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:29,125
A rose will bloom

416
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:32,500
It then will fade

417
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,749
So does a youth

418
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:48,845
So does the fairest maid

419
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:01,010
Juliet!

420
00:35:01,287 --> 00:35:02,780
Lady Juliet!

421
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:04,167
Nurse?

422
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,775
Your mother craves
a word with you.

423
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,399
Make haste, make haste!

424
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,249
What is her mother?

425
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,100
Marry, bachelor,

426
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,000
her mother is
the lady of the house,

427
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,536
and a good lady,
and a wise and virtuous.

428
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,313
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

429
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,000
I tell you, he that
shall lay hold of her

430
00:35:38,064 --> 00:35:40,964
shall have the chinks.

431
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,500
Is she a Capulet?

432
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,000
O dear account!

433
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,600
My life is my foe's debt.

434
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,531
What ho, my mistresses?

435
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,700
What, will you be gone?

436
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,157
It seems so, for God,
it is so very late

437
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,253
that we may call it early,
by and by.

438
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,818
Sweet my lady Juliet.

439
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,689
Come hither, nurse.

440
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,200
What is yond gentleman?

441
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,200
Count Paris.

442
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,871
No. What's he
that follows there?

443
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,450
I know not.

444
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,693
Go ask his name.

445
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,400
Romeo, of
the house of Montague.

446
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,000
What?

447
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
His name is Romeo,
and a Montague,

448
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,731
the only son of
your great enemy.

449
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,900
My only love sprung
from my only hate!

450
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,456
Too early seen unknown,
and known too late!

451
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,699
Prodigious birth of love
it is to me

452
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,173
That I must love
a loathed enemy.

453
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,800
Juliet!

454
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,516
Lady Juliet!

455
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,000
Madam!

456
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,000
Romeo!

457
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,000
Juliet!

458
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:35,199
Romeo!

459
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,769
Lady Juliet!

460
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,000
Juliet!

461
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,042
Romeo!

462
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,120
Romeo!

463
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:53,538
Romeo!

464
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,000
Romeo!

465
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,210
Romeo!

466
00:38:01,387 --> 00:38:02,220
Romeo!

467
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,145
Romeo!

468
00:38:04,622 --> 00:38:06,500
Romeo!

469
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,800
One, two, three.

470
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,500
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

471
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:16,550
He is wise,

472
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:19,300
and, on my life, hath
stolen him home to bed.

473
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,800
He leaped this orchard wall.

474
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,500
Call, good Mercutio.

475
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,220
Romeo!

476
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,645
Romeo! Passion! Lover!

477
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,900
Madman!

478
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:33,100
Romeo!

479
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,300
He heareth not, he stirreth
not, be moveth not.

480
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,446
The ape is dead.

481
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,611
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.

482
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,610
Romeo, good night.

483
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,900
But soft!

484
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,295
What light through
yonder window breaks?

485
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,652
It is my lady.

486
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,569
O, it is my love!

487
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,656
O, that she knew she were!

488
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,538
She speaks,
yet she says nothing.

489
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,492
What of that?

490
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,900
Her eye discourses,
I will answer it.

491
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,695
I am too bold,

492
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,931
'tis not to me she speaks.

493
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,056
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens,

494
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,630
having some business,
do entreat her eyes

495
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,669
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.

496
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,174
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand!

497
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,355
O, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

498
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,576
that I might touch
that cheek!

499
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,132
Ay me!

500
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,613
She speaks.

501
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,735
O, speak again, bright angel!

502
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,936
O Romeo, Romeo!

503
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,490
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

504
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,017
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.

505
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,052
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

506
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,878
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.

507
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,200
Shall I hear more,
or shall I speak at this?

508
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,017
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.

509
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,934
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

510
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,690
What is Montague?

511
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,777
It is nor hand, nor foot,
nor arm, nor face,

512
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,711
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

513
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,936
O, be some other name!

514
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,851
What's in a name?

515
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,851
That which we call a rose

516
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,136
By any other name
would smell as sweet.

517
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,413
So Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

518
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,431
retain that dear perfection

519
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,131
which he owes
without that title.

520
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,719
Romeo, doff thy name,

521
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,300
and for that name
which is no part of thee,

522
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,734
take all myself.

523
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,069
I take thee at thy word.

524
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,932
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;

525
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,339
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.

526
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,200
What man art thou that,
thus bescreened in night,

527
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,600
so stumblest on my counsel?

528
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,170
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.

529
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,895
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,

530
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,750
because it is
an enemy to thee.

531
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,738
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.

532
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,411
My ears have not yet drunk

533
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,850
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,

534
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,600
yet I know the sound.

535
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,070
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

536
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,600
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.

537
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,000
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?

538
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,800
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,

539
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,017
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

540
00:42:24,154 --> 00:42:26,000
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

541
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,435
With love's light wings

542
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,133
did I o'er perch
these walls,

543
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,500
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

544
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,175
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

545
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,794
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.

546
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,792
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.

547
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,051
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.

548
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,411
And, but thou love me,

549
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,050
let them find me here.

550
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,400
My life were better
ended by their hate,

551
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,096
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.

552
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,639
Dost thou love me?

553
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,777
I know thou wilt say "Ay";
and I will take thy word.

554
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,600
Yet, if thou swearest,
thou mayst prove false.

555
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,409
At lovers' perjuries
they say Jove laughs.

556
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,930
O gentle Romeo,

557
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,713
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

558
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,809
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,

559
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,132
I'll frown, and be perverse,
and say thee nay,

560
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,619
so thou wilt woo;

561
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,853
but else, not for the world.

562
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,894
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond.

563
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,450
And therefore thou mayst
think my haviour light.

564
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,312
No.

565
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,139
But trust me, gentleman,
I'll prove more true

566
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,532
than those that have
more cunning to be strange.

567
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,971
I should have been more
strange, I must confess,

568
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,900
but that thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,

569
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,678
my true love's passion;

570
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,814
therefore pardon me,

571
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,770
and not impute this yielding
to light love,

572
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,998
which the dark night
hath so discovered.

573
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,350
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon I swear...

574
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,100
O, swear not by the moon,

575
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,100
the inconstant moon,

576
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,576
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

577
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,976
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.

578
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,000
What shall I swear by?

579
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,658
Do not swear at all.

580
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,809
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy
gracious self,

581
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,175
Which is the god
of my idolatry,

582
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,000
And I'll believe thee.

583
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,376
If my heart's dear love...
I swear!

584
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,169
Oh, Juliet!

585
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,373
Sweet, good night.

586
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,015
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath,

587
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,534
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

588
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,933
Good night, good night!

589
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,934
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart

590
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,416
as that within my breast.

591
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,773
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

592
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,615
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

593
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,930
Th' exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

594
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,209
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.

595
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,815
And yet I would it were
to give again.

596
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,731
Would'st thou withdraw it?

597
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,100
For what purpose, love?

598
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,297
But to be frank,
and give it thee again.

599
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,409
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have.

600
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,200
My bounty is
as boundless as the sea,

601
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,113
my love as deep.

602
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,500
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,

603
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,830
for both are infinite.

604
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,409
Juliet!

605
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,334
Anon, good nurse!

606
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,273
Sweet Montague, be true.

607
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,880
Madam!

608
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,935
Stay but a little,
I will come again.

609
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:47,142
Madam! Lady Juliet!

610
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,280
O blessed, blessed night!

611
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,780
Oh! I am afeard,
being in night,

612
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,780
all this is but a dream,

613
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,880
too flattering-sweet
to be substantial.

614
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,580
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

615
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,800
If that thy bent of love
be honourable,

616
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,394
thy purpose marriage,
send me word tomorrow,

617
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,400
by one that I'll procure
to come to thee.

618
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,060
Where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite;

619
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,430
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay,

620
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,340
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

621
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,255
Madam!

622
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,419
I come, anon.

623
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,550
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee -

624
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,508
Lady Juliet!

625
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,293
By and by, I come!

626
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,968
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.

627
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,013
Tomorrow will I send.

628
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,993
So thrive my soul.

629
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,168
A thousand times good night!

630
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,200
Romeo!

631
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,400
At what o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

632
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,571
At the hour of nine.

633
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,295
I will not fail.

634
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,895
'Tis twenty years till then.

635
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,655
Romeo!

636
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,616
I have forgot
why I did call thee back.

637
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,656
Let me stand here
till thou remember it.

638
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,300
I shall forget, to have
thee still stand there,

639
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,298
remembering how
I love thy company.

640
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,500
And I'll still stay,

641
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,400
to have thee still forget,

642
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,409
forgetting
any other home but this.

643
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,492
Good night, good night!

644
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,574
Parting is such sweet sorrow,

645
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,971
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

646
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,219
Friar Laurence!

647
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,098
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

648
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,333
Good morrow, father!

649
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,533
Young son, it argues
a distempered head

650
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,777
So soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

651
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,731
Therefore thy earliness
doth me assure,

652
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,091
Thou art uproused with
some distemperature.

653
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,331
Or if not so,
then here I put it right,

654
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,709
Our Romeo hath not
been in bed tonight.

655
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,496
That last is true,
the sweeter rest was mine.

656
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,458
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?

657
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,453
With Rosaline?
My ghostly father, no.

658
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,811
I have forgot that name,
and that name's woe.

659
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,089
That's my good son.

660
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,978
Well, where hast
thou been, then?

661
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,012
I'll tell thee, ere
thou ask it me again.

662
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,373
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

663
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,474
Where on a sudden
one hath wounded me.

664
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,290
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

665
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,709
Riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift.

666
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:56,871
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set

667
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,692
On the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

668
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,615
As mine on hers,
so hers is set on mine,

669
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,700
And all combined,
save what thou must combine

670
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,800
By holy marriage. When,
and where, and how,

671
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,378
We met, we woo'd, and made
exchange of vow,

672
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,850
I'll tell thee as we pass;
but this I pray,

673
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,529
That thou consent
to marry us today.

674
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,600
Holy Saint Francis!

675
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,900
Is Rosaline, that thou
didst love so dear,

676
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,900
so soon forsaken?

677
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,256
Thou doest not mock me,
Father!

678
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,700
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

679
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,480
but in their eyes.

680
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,412
Hear me, Father.

681
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,712
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine

682
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,956
Hath washed thy sallow
cheeks for Rosaline!

683
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,998
And art thou changed?

684
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,672
Pronounce this sentence then,

685
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,091
Women may fall, when
there's no strength in men.

686
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,978
Thou chid'st me oft
for loving Rosaline.

687
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,000
For doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

688
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,891
Yes, for loving.
And badest me bury love.

689
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,657
Not in a grave, to lay one
in, another out to have.

690
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,410
Come, young waverer.
Come, go with me.

691
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,334
In one respect
I'll thy assistant be.

692
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,136
O, Father!

693
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,731
For this alliance
may so happy prove,

694
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,788
To turn your households'
rancour to pure love.

695
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,400
O, let us hence! I stand on
sudden haste.

696
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,898
Wisely and slow,
they stumble that run fast.

697
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,890
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

698
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,493
Came he not home tonight?

699
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,400
Came he not home tonight?

700
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,300
Who?

701
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:52,050
Romeo.

702
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,331
O no, not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

703
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,009
Hey, Tybalt, the kinsman
to old Capulet,

704
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,178
hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

705
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,200
A challenge, on my life.

706
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,978
Romeo will answer it.

707
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,671
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

708
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,500
Nay, he will answer
the letter's master,

709
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,258
how he dares, being dared.

710
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,136
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead!

711
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,169
Stabbed with
a white wench's black eye;

712
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,256
run through the ear
with a love song;

713
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,500
the very pin of his heart

714
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,649
cleft with the blind
bow-boy's butt-shaft.

715
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,915
And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

716
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,892
Why, what is Tybalt?

717
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,734
More than prince of cats,
I can tell you.

718
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,853
Good morrow to you both.

719
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,875
That we should be
thus afflicted

720
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,494
with these strange flies,

721
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,700
these fashion-mongers,

722
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,891
these pardonnez moi's.

723
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,535
Signior Romeo, bon jour!

724
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,848
Bon jour.

725
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,929
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.

726
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,916
You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

727
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,389
What counterfeit
did I give you?

728
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,100
The slip, sir, the slip.

729
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,899
Can you not conceive?

730
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,296
Pardon, good Mercutio.

731
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,896
My business was great,

732
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,616
and in such a case as mine

733
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,200
a man may strain courtesy.

734
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,300
Come between us,
good Benvolio;

735
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,390
my wit faints.

736
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,511
Thy wit is
very bitter sweeting;

737
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,277
it is most sharp sauce.

738
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,900
Why, is not this better now

739
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,735
than groaning for love?

740
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,853
Now art thou sociable,

741
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,132
now art thou Romeo;

742
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,058
now art thou what thou art,

743
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,729
by art as well as by nature.

744
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,650
For this drivelling love
is like a great natural

745
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,500
that runs lolling up and down

746
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,260
to hide his bauble in a hole.

747
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,599
Stop there, stop there.

748
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,656
Thou desirest me to stop
in my tale against the hair?

749
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,395
Thou wouldst else
have made thy tale large.

750
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,939
No, no, no,
thou art deceived;

751
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,053
for I was come to
the whole depth of my tale,

752
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,498
and meant indeed to occupy
the argument no longer.

753
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,352
Here's goodly gear!

754
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,479
Here's a fine barge!

755
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,879
A sail.

756
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,279
A sail, a sail!

757
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,973
Two, two; a shirt
and a smock.

758
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,819
Peter.

759
00:56:33,827 --> 00:56:35,800
Anon.

760
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,692
My fan, Peter.

761
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,000
Good Peter, to hide her face;

762
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,377
for her fan's
the fairer of the two.

763
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,276
God ye good morrow,
gentlemen.

764
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,178
God ye good den,
fair gentlewoman.

765
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,888
Is it good den, I pray?

766
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,829
Well, 'tis no less,
I tell you,

767
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,929
for the bawdy hand
of the dial

768
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,790
is now upon the prick
of noon.

769
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,673
Out upon you,
what a man are you?

770
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,693
One, gentlewoman, that God
hath made himself to mar.

771
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,600
By my troth, it is well said.

772
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,078
"For himself to mar,"
quoth 'a?

773
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,990
Gentlemen, can any
of you tell me

774
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,500
where I may find
young Romeo?

775
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:21,677
Romeo, Romeo.

776
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,657
I am the youngest
of that name,

777
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,499
for fault of a worse.

778
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,890
If you be he, sir,

779
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I desire some
conference with you.

780
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,872
She will indite him
to some supper.

781
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,160
A bawd, a bawd.

782
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:49,998
A bawd!

783
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,200
You filthy bum!

784
00:57:58,156 --> 00:58:00,000
Mercutio, no!

785
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,540
An old hare hoar,

786
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,300
And an old hare hoar,

787
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,257
Is very good meat in lent:

788
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,040
But a hare that is hoar

789
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,211
Is too much for a score

790
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,891
When it hoars
ere it be spent.

791
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,433
Farewell, ancient lady.

792
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,914
Scurvy knave, scurvy knave!

793
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,193
I'm none of his flirt-gills!

794
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,493
I'm none of his skains-mates!

795
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,800
Er, cur, lousy knave,

796
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,858
lousy, lousy knave.

797
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,800
I pray you, sir,

798
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,776
what saucy merchant was this,

799
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,272
that was so full
of his property?

800
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,494
A gentleman, nurse, that
loves to hear himself talk,

801
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,729
and will speak
more in a minute,

802
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,295
than he will stand to
in a month.

803
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,558
An 'a speak anything against
me, I'll take him down,

804
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,000
an 'a were lustier
than he is,

805
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,295
and twenty such jacks;

806
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,577
and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.

807
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,993
And thou must stand by too,

808
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,700
and suffer every knave

809
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,873
to use me at his pleasure!

810
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,633
Punk rampant!

811
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,132
Pray you, sir, a word.

812
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,272
Beef wit.

813
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,492
My young lady bade me
inquire you out.

814
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,774
What she did bid me say,
I will keep to myself;

815
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,332
but first let me tell ye,

816
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,679
if ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise...

817
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,637
Nurse...

818
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,400
...as they say,

819
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,958
it were a very gross
kind of behaviour,

820
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,753
for the gentlewoman is young;

821
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,917
and therefore, if you
should deal double with her,

822
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,133
truly, an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman,

823
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,452
and very weak dealing.

824
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,976
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady and mistress.

825
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,051
I protest unto thee.

826
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,257
Bid her devise

827
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,909
some means to come to shrift
this afternoon;

828
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,618
and there she shall
at friar Laurence's cell

829
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,955
be shrived and married.

830
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,353
Here's for thy pains.

831
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,054
No, no truly, sir,
not a penny.

832
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,500
Go to, I say you shall.

833
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,379
No.

834
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,333
Well...

835
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,975
Sir, my mistress
is the sweetest lady.

836
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,329
Lord, Lord, when she were
a little prating thing...

837
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,611
Goodbye.

838
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,089
O, there is
a nobleman in town,

839
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,832
one Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard.

840
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,250
I anger her sometimes, and say

841
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,800
that Paris
is the properer man.

842
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,238
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady.

843
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,195
A thousand times.

844
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,012
The clock struck nine
when I did send the nurse.

845
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,930
In half an hour
she promised to return.

846
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,700
Perchance
she cannot meet him.

847
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,800
That's not so.

848
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,572
O, she's lame.

849
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,171
Love's heralds
should be thoughts.

850
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,374
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,

851
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,255
she would be as swift
in motion as a ball.

852
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,070
But old folks, many feign
as they were dead;

853
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,815
unwieldy, slow, heavy,

854
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,880
and pale as lead.

855
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,929
O God, she comes.

856
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,014
O honey nurse, what news?

857
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,169
O Lord, why look'st thou sad?

858
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,300
Though news be sad,
yet tell them merrily.

859
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,000
Send thy man away.

860
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,640
Peter, stay at the gate.

861
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,150
Go on.

862
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,349
Hast thou met with him?

863
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,410
Oh, I am aweary, give me
leave awhile.

864
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,359
Fie, how my bones ache!

865
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,333
Sweet, sweet,

866
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,055
sweet nurse.

867
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,929
Tell me, what says my love?

868
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,988
Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

869
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:38,375
and a courteous, and a kind,

870
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:41,817
and a handsome,
and, I warrant him,

871
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,432
a virtuous...

872
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,859
Where is your mother?

873
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,479
Where is my mother?

874
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,700
Why, she is within.
Where should she be?

875
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,612
How oddly thou repliest!

876
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,857
"Your love says like
an honest gentleman,

877
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,093
where is your mother?"

878
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,074
O God's Lady dear!
Are you so hot?

879
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,469
Marry, come up, I trow.

880
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,513
Is this the poultice
for my aching bones?

881
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,370
Henceforward do
your messages yourself.

882
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,233
Here's such a coil!

883
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,214
Come, what says Romeo?

884
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,071
Have you got leave
to go to shrift today?

885
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,540
I have.

886
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,591
Then hie you hence
to friar Laurence's cell.

887
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:23,030
There stays a husband
to make you a wife.

888
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,559
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.

889
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,868
They'll be in scarlet
straight at any news.

890
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,869
Hie you to church.
I'll to dinner.

891
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,139
Honest nurse, farewell.

892
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,570
So smile the heavens
upon this holy act,

893
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,370
that after-hours with sorrow
chide us not.

894
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,956
Amen, amen.

895
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,756
But come what sorrow can,

896
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,416
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy

897
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,414
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.

898
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,500
These violent delights
have violent ends

899
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,860
and in their triumph die,
like fire and powder,

900
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,660
which, as they kiss, consume.

901
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,135
The sweetest honey
is loathsome

902
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:16,990
in its own...

903
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:17,800
deliciousness.

904
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:19,200
Deliciousness.

905
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,273
And in the taste
confounds the...

906
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,100
appetite.

907
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,300
Appetite.

908
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:26,500
Therefore love moderately:

909
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,659
long love doth so.

910
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,899
Here comes the lady.

911
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,299
O, so light a foot will ne'er
wear out the everlasting flint.

912
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,979
Juliet!

913
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,717
Good even to
my ghostly confessor.

914
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,075
Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.

915
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,700
Ah, Juliet,

916
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,251
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,

917
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,600
that thy skill be
more to blazon it,

918
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,318
then sweeten with thy breath
this neighbour air.

919
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,733
They are but beggars
that can count their worth.

920
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,415
But my true love is
grown to such excess,

921
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:04,657
I cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth.

922
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:11,014
Come, come with me.
We will make short work;

923
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,400
for, by your leaves, you
shall not stay alone,

924
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,977
till holy Church
incorporate two in one.

925
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,332
I pray thee,
good Mercutio, let's retire.

926
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,600
The day is hot.

927
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,700
The Capulets abroad.

928
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,856
If we meet, we shall not
scape a brawl.

929
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,800
For now, these hot days,
is the mad blood stirring.

930
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,900
Mercutio, let's retire.

931
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,100
Thou art like one
of these fellows

932
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,977
that, when he enters
the confines of a tavern,

933
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,474
claps me his sword
on the table,

934
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,216
and says, "God send me
no need of thee!"

935
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,056
and by the operation
of the second cup,

936
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,420
draws him on the drawer,
when indeed there is no need.

937
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,468
Am I like such a fellow?

938
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,559
Nay, an there were two such,
we should have none shortly,

939
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,159
for the one would kill
the other.

940
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,773
Why thou hast
quarrelled with a man

941
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,873
for coughing in the street,

942
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,531
because he hath wakened
thy dog that hath lain asleep

943
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,900
in the sun.

944
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:09,194
And thou wilt tutor me
from quarrelling!

945
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,232
Mercutio...

946
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,400
By my head,
here come the Capulets.

947
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,690
By my heel, I care not.

948
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,900
Gentlemen, good den.

949
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,800
Good den.

950
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,213
A word with one of you.

951
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,090
And but one word
with one of us?

952
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:59,440
Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.

953
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,211
You shall find me
apt enough for that, sir,

954
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,898
and you will
give me occasion.

955
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:11,880
Can you not take some
occasion without the giving?

956
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:16,873
Mercutio, thou
consort'st with Romeo.

957
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,900
Consort?

958
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,500
What, dost thou
make us minstrels?

959
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,300
If you make minstrels of us,

960
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,933
you look to hear
nothing but discords.

961
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,538
Here's my fiddlestick.

962
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,800
Here's that shall
make you dance.

963
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,151
Zounds, consort!

964
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,610
We talk here in
the public haunt of men.

965
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,771
Either withdraw unto
some private place

966
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,090
or reason coldly
of your grievances.

967
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,835
Or else depart;
here all eyes gaze on us.

968
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,112
Men's eyes were made
to look, and let them gaze.

969
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:45,890
Mercutio!

970
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,995
I will not budge for
no man's pleasure, I!

971
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,891
Well, peace be with you, sir.

972
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,268
Here comes my man.

973
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,699
Mercutio!

974
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,569
Tybalt.

975
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,500
Romeo, the love
I bear thee can afford

976
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,300
no better term than this:

977
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,499
thou art a villain.

978
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,659
Tybalt, the reason that
I have to love thee

979
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,113
doth much excuse
the appertaining rage

980
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,715
to such a greeting.
Villain am I none.

981
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,231
Therefore farewell.

982
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,900
I see thou knowest not me.

983
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,690
Boy!

984
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,734
This shall not excuse the
injuries thou hast done me.

985
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,938
Therefore turn and draw!

986
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,851
I do protest,
I never injured thee,

987
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,670
but love thee better
than thou canst devise,

988
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,058
till thou shalt know
the reason of my love.

989
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,000
And so, good Capulet,

990
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,788
which name I tender
as dearly as mine own,

991
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,939
be satisfied.

992
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,249
No, no.

993
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,774
No, Mercutio.

994
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,191
O calm, dishonourable,
vile submission!

995
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,395
No, Mercutio, no!

996
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,456
Leave me!

997
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,800
Tybalt, you ratcatcher!

998
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,860
What would'st thou
have with me?

999
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,929
Good king of cats,

1000
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,412
nothing but one of
your nine lives,

1001
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,831
that I mean to
make bold withal,

1002
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,631
and as you shall
use me hereafter,

1003
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,959
dry-beat the rest
of the eight!

1004
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,814
Please, good Mercutio.

1005
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,300
Will you pluck your sword
out of his pilcher

1006
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,839
by the ears?

1007
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:51,800
Make haste,

1008
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,456
lest mine be about your ears
ere it be out!

1009
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,770
I am for you, sir.

1010
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,774
Gentle Mercutio,
put thy rapier up.

1011
01:13:09,053 --> 01:13:10,872
Come on, come.

1012
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,916
Benvolio, beat down
their weapons!

1013
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,692
Gentlemen, for shame!
Forbear this outrage!

1014
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,800
The prince expressly hath
forbid this bandying

1015
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,969
in Verona streets.

1016
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,496
Tybalt!

1017
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:29,857
Mercutio!

1018
01:13:31,445 --> 01:13:32,200
Leave us!

1019
01:13:32,255 --> 01:13:33,578
Leave us. Away, you coward!

1020
01:13:33,674 --> 01:13:35,237
Go hang thyself.

1021
01:14:34,764 --> 01:14:37,282
Cut his hair, Tybalt!

1022
01:14:56,188 --> 01:14:58,791
Keep your distance, Tybalt.

1023
01:15:06,441 --> 01:15:08,922
Keep away, coward!

1024
01:15:11,745 --> 01:15:15,070
Make haste, Tybalt,
we cannot wait all day.

1025
01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:20,846
Ah, mother's baby
has dropped his sword.

1026
01:15:27,573 --> 01:15:28,337
Tybalt, no!

1027
01:15:29,232 --> 01:15:31,406
Gentlemen, restrain!

1028
01:15:31,502 --> 01:15:32,545
Tybalt, go!

1029
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:34,764
Mercutio, come!

1030
01:15:46,351 --> 01:15:48,190
Begone, begone...

1031
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,871
Fly, Tybalt. Fly away.

1032
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,533
I am hurt.

1033
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,473
I'm hurt.

1034
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,609
What, art thou hurt?

1035
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:21,653
A scratch, a scratch.
Marry, 'tis enough.

1036
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,018
Courage, man.
The hurt cannot be much.

1037
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:28,128
No, 'tis not so deep
as a well,

1038
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,438
nor so wide as a church door,

1039
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,328
but 'tis enough!

1040
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,100
You ask for me tomorrow,

1041
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,458
and you shall find me
a grave man.

1042
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,000
Where is my page?

1043
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:43,675
Go, villain,
and fetch me a surgeon.

1044
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:46,155
Fetch me a surgeon!

1045
01:16:47,865 --> 01:16:49,700
Did he hurt you?

1046
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,455
Why the devil
came you between us?

1047
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,430
I was hurt under your arm.

1048
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,351
I thought all
for the best, I...

1049
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:21,694
Help me into some house,
Benvolio, or I shall faint.

1050
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:39,500
A plague o' both your houses!

1051
01:17:39,601 --> 01:17:41,401
He drinks too much wine!

1052
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:47,215
They have made
worms' meat of me.

1053
01:17:50,118 --> 01:17:51,841
I have it,

1054
01:17:51,937 --> 01:17:54,339
and soundly too.

1055
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,800
Your houses!

1056
01:17:59,112 --> 01:18:00,972
He jests!

1057
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,970
Mercutio!

1058
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,499
Romeo, Romeo!

1059
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,149
Brave Mercutio's dead.

1060
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:38,474
This day's black fate
on more days doth depend.

1061
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,658
This but begins the woe
others must end.

1062
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,416
He gone in triumph!

1063
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,716
And Mercutio slain!

1064
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:51,870
Away to heaven,
respective lenity,

1065
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,496
and fire-eyed fury
be my conduct now!

1066
01:18:56,968 --> 01:18:58,611
Tybalt!

1067
01:19:00,146 --> 01:19:02,000
Tybalt!

1068
01:19:02,444 --> 01:19:04,000
Romeo!

1069
01:19:08,779 --> 01:19:10,200
Tybalt!

1070
01:19:10,698 --> 01:19:12,041
Romeo!

1071
01:19:14,488 --> 01:19:16,000
This way!

1072
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:18,200
Tybalt!

1073
01:19:18,752 --> 01:19:20,500
Romeo!

1074
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,200
Tybalt!

1075
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,534
Now, Tybalt,

1076
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,333
take the "villain" back again,

1077
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:35,538
that late thou gavest me;

1078
01:19:35,898 --> 01:19:37,141
for Mercutio's soul

1079
01:19:37,237 --> 01:19:39,519
is but a little way
above our heads,

1080
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,055
staying for thine
to keep him company.

1081
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,536
Either thou, or I, or both,

1082
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,776
must go with him!

1083
01:19:52,808 --> 01:19:54,678
Let him go!

1084
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,970
Have this!

1085
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,772
Sword, Romeo.

1086
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:07,287
Thou, wretched boy,

1087
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:09,006
that didst consort him here,

1088
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,235
shalt with him hence.

1089
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:12,209
This shall determine that.

1090
01:20:24,734 --> 01:20:26,734
Keep your feet, Romeo!

1091
01:20:28,402 --> 01:20:30,402
Attack the head, Romeo!

1092
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,350
Give me your sword.

1093
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,910
Quick!

1094
01:21:41,993 --> 01:21:43,895
Give him a sword!

1095
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:45,140
A sword!

1096
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,156
A sword!

1097
01:22:17,737 --> 01:22:20,376
Romeo! Romeo!

1098
01:22:40,852 --> 01:22:42,211
A sword!

1099
01:22:42,507 --> 01:22:44,234
A sword!

1100
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:45,368
Give it to me!

1101
01:22:45,564 --> 01:22:47,203
Your sword, Romeo!

1102
01:22:47,299 --> 01:22:48,838
The sword, Romeo!

1103
01:23:01,517 --> 01:23:03,056
Tybalt!

1104
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,996
Romeo, away, be gone.

1105
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,800
The citizens are up.
Stand not amazed.

1106
01:23:12,908 --> 01:23:15,574
The prince will doom thee
death if thou art taken.

1107
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:17,208
Hence, be gone, away!

1108
01:23:17,304 --> 01:23:19,343
Romeo!

1109
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,632
O, I am fortune's fool!

1110
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:29,532
O, Romeo! Away, away!

1111
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I am fortune's fool!

1112
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,949
A curse on the Montagues!

1113
01:23:38,049 --> 01:23:40,215
O, Tybalt!

1114
01:23:40,311 --> 01:23:42,346
Tybalt! Tybalt!

1115
01:23:42,446 --> 01:23:44,564
The best friend I had!

1116
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,693
O, courteous Tybalt,
honest gentleman!

1117
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:50,539
That ever I should live
to see thee dead!

1118
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,090
O God!

1119
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,291
Did Romeo's hand
shed Tybalt's blood?

1120
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,757
It did, it did.
Alas the day, it did!

1121
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,200
O, nurse!

1122
01:23:58,370 --> 01:24:02,400
O, serpent heart,
hid with a flowering face!

1123
01:24:02,586 --> 01:24:05,368
Was ever book containing
such vile matter

1124
01:24:05,464 --> 01:24:07,787
so fairly bound?

1125
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:15,990
There's no faith, no trust,
no honesty in men;

1126
01:24:16,037 --> 01:24:20,137
all perjured, all forsworn,
all naught, all dissemblers.

1127
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,632
Shame come to Romeo!

1128
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,497
Blistered be thy tongue
for such a wish!

1129
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,777
He was not born to shame.

1130
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,494
Upon his brow shame
is ashamed to sit.

1131
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,936
Would you speak well of him
that killed your cousin?

1132
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,949
Shall I speak ill of him
that is my husband?

1133
01:24:40,882 --> 01:24:43,180
Ah, poor my lord,

1134
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,579
what tongue shall
smooth thy name,

1135
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:50,091
when I, thy three-hours wife,
have mangled it?

1136
01:24:51,977 --> 01:24:55,439
But wherefore, villain,
didst thou kill my cousin?

1137
01:24:56,231 --> 01:24:58,725
Capulet! To the prince!

1138
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,100
Speak, Benvolio, speak!

1139
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,288
Go on, speak.

1140
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,452
Prince, as thou art true,

1141
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,000
for blood of ours,
shed blood of Montague.

1142
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,936
Benvolio, who began
this bloody fray?

1143
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,010
Tybalt, here slain!

1144
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,376
No!

1145
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:50,330
Romeo did speak him fair,

1146
01:25:50,430 --> 01:25:52,408
bid him bethink how nice
the quarrel was,

1147
01:25:52,504 --> 01:25:54,630
and urged withal
your high displeasure.

1148
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,809
It's true, prince.

1149
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:59,418
Affection makes him false,
he speaks not true!

1150
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:08,150
I beg for justice, which
thou, prince, must give.

1151
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:13,296
Romeo slew Tybalt,
Romeo must not live!

1152
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,871
Romeo slew him.

1153
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,769
He slew Mercutio.

1154
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:40,572
Who now the price
of his dear blood doth owe?

1155
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:49,517
Not Romeo, prince.
He was Mercutio's friend.

1156
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:53,310
His fault concludes
but what the law should end.

1157
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,100
The life of Tybalt!

1158
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,199
And for that offence,

1159
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,299
immediately we do
exile him hence.

1160
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,173
Let Romeo hence in haste,

1161
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,500
else, when he's found,

1162
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:09,211
that hour is his last.

1163
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,673
Banishment!

1164
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:29,455
Be merciful, say "death",
do not say "banishment".

1165
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:31,018
Arise!

1166
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,797
One knocks.
Good Romeo, hide thyself.

1167
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,015
Who's there?

1168
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,459
Who knocks so hard?

1169
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,969
Whence come you?
What's your will?

1170
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:45,842
Let me come in,
and you shall know my errand.

1171
01:27:45,942 --> 01:27:48,460
I come from lady Juliet.

1172
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,919
Welcome, then.

1173
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:56,297
Holy friar,
o tell me, holy friar,

1174
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:58,694
where's my lady's lord,
where's Romeo?

1175
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,419
There on the ground, with
his own tears made drunk.

1176
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,315
There is no world
without Verona walls.

1177
01:28:06,164 --> 01:28:07,866
Even so lies she,

1178
01:28:07,962 --> 01:28:09,405
blubbering and weeping,

1179
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:11,444
weeping and blubbering.

1180
01:28:11,979 --> 01:28:13,722
Stand up!

1181
01:28:13,818 --> 01:28:17,080
Stand, and you be a man.

1182
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:21,415
For Juliet's sake,
for her sake, rise and stand.

1183
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,776
Why should you fall
into so deep an O?

1184
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,069
Nurse!

1185
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,655
Sir, sir! Death's
the end of all.

1186
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,710
Spakest thou of Juliet?

1187
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:31,272
How is it with her?

1188
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:33,472
Doth she not think
me an old murderer?

1189
01:28:33,567 --> 01:28:35,565
Where is she? How doth she?

1190
01:28:35,665 --> 01:28:38,843
What says my concealed lady
to our cancelled love?

1191
01:28:38,943 --> 01:28:41,721
She says nothing, sir,
but weeps and weeps,

1192
01:28:41,821 --> 01:28:44,400
and Tybalt calls,
and then on Romeo cries.

1193
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,493
As if that name
did murder her.

1194
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,811
O tell me, friar, tell me,

1195
01:28:49,995 --> 01:28:54,312
in what vile part of this
anatomy doth my name lodge?

1196
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:57,000
Tell me, that I may sack
the hateful mansion!

1197
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,488
Hold thy desperate hand!

1198
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,812
By heavens, leave me!

1199
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,398
Thou hast amazed me.

1200
01:29:07,838 --> 01:29:09,460
Art thou a man?

1201
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,791
Thy form cries out thou art.

1202
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:14,059
Thy tears are womanish,

1203
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:17,694
thy wild acts denote the
unreasonable fury of a beast!

1204
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,539
Hast thou slain Tybalt?

1205
01:29:19,633 --> 01:29:21,335
Wilt thou slay thyself,
and slay thy lady,

1206
01:29:21,431 --> 01:29:22,774
that in thy life lives,

1207
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:24,859
by doing damned hate
upon thyself?

1208
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,119
Rouse thee, man!

1209
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:33,067
Thy Juliet is alive,
there art thou happy!

1210
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,745
Tybalt would kill thee,
but thou slewest Tybalt;

1211
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,736
there art thou happy.

1212
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,769
The law, that threatened
death, becomes thy friend,

1213
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,291
and turns it to exile;

1214
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,133
there art thou happy!

1215
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,849
A pack of blessings
light upon thy back.

1216
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:52,154
Ascend her chamber,
hence and comfort her.

1217
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:55,812
But look, thou stay
not till the watch be set,

1218
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,292
for then thou canst not
pass to Mantua,

1219
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:01,200
where thou shalt live,
till we find a time to

1220
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:03,500
blaze your marriage,
reconcile your friends,

1221
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,000
beg pardon of the prince,
and call thee home

1222
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,009
with twenty hundred
thousand times more joy

1223
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:11,820
than thou wentest forth
in lamentation.

1224
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,495
Go before, nurse.

1225
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:17,874
Commend me to thy lady,

1226
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,198
and bid her hasten
all the house to bed,

1227
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,319
which heavy sorrow
makes them apt unto.

1228
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,200
Romeo is coming.

1229
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,813
Wilt thou be gone?

1230
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,216
It is not yet near day.

1231
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,497
It was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1232
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,576
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

1233
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,138
Nightly she sings
on yond pomegranate tree.

1234
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,818
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale.

1235
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:55,454
It was the lark,

1236
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:59,829
the herald of the morn,
no nightingale.

1237
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:05,659
Night's candles
are burnt out.

1238
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:18,269
And jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountain tops.

1239
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:24,090
I must be gone and live,

1240
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,330
or stay and die.

1241
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,932
Yond light is not daylight.

1242
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,259
I know it, I.

1243
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:43,259
Therefore stay yet,
thou need'st not to be gone.

1244
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,828
Let me be taken,
let me be put to death.

1245
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,276
I am content, so thou
wilt have it so.

1246
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:53,616
I'll say yon grey
is not the morning's eye,

1247
01:33:53,748 --> 01:33:54,771
nor that is not the lark,

1248
01:33:54,867 --> 01:33:56,665
whose notes do beat
the vaulty heaven

1249
01:33:56,765 --> 01:33:58,512
so high above our heads.

1250
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:02,914
I have more care
to stay, than will to go.

1251
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:06,098
Come, death, and welcome!
Juliet wills it so.

1252
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:10,335
It is!

1253
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:12,933
It is, hie hence,
be gone, away!

1254
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:16,394
Romeo, it is!

1255
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,775
It is the lark that
sings so out of tune,

1256
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:27,112
straining harsh discords,
and unpleasing sharps.

1257
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:30,810
Some say the lark
makes sweet division;

1258
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:34,278
this doth not so,
for she divideth us.

1259
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,994
So now be gone; more light
and light it grows.

1260
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,754
More light and light.

1261
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:43,395
More dark and dark our woes.

1262
01:34:45,864 --> 01:34:47,711
Madam!

1263
01:34:48,007 --> 01:34:50,589
Your lady mother
comes to your chamber.

1264
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:53,390
Nurse.

1265
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,318
Your lady mother is
coming to your chamber.

1266
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,674
The day is broke, look about.

1267
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,497
Art thou gone so?

1268
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,549
My husband, friend!

1269
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,615
I must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

1270
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,632
for in a minute
there are many days.

1271
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:13,076
O, by this count
I shall be much in years,

1272
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:14,973
ere I again behold my Romeo.

1273
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,359
I will omit no opportunity

1274
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,892
that may convey
my greetings, love, to thee.

1275
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:25,492
Think'st thou
we shall ever meet again?

1276
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,693
I doubt it not.

1277
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,452
And all these woes
shall serve

1278
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:34,456
for sweet discourses
in our time to come.

1279
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,674
Farewell, farewell!

1280
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:43,290
One kiss, and I'll descend.

1281
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,854
Adieu.

1282
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,938
Adieu!

1283
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:22,489
O God!

1284
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:47,113
We will have vengeance
for it, fear thou not.

1285
01:36:47,217 --> 01:36:49,000
No!

1286
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,972
Then weep no more.

1287
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,132
I'll send to one in Mantua,

1288
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:01,874
where that same
banished runagate doth live,

1289
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:05,574
shall give him such
an unaccustomed dram,

1290
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,078
that he shall soon
keep Tybalt company.

1291
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,482
No!

1292
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:15,612
But now I'll tell thee
joyful tidings, girl.

1293
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:18,655
Well, thou hast
a careful father.

1294
01:37:19,473 --> 01:37:21,355
One who, to put thee
from thy heaviness,

1295
01:37:21,451 --> 01:37:24,853
hath sorted out
a sudden day of joy.

1296
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,691
Joy comes well
in such a needy time.

1297
01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:31,593
Marry, my child,
early next Thursday morn,

1298
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:33,654
the gallant, young
and noble prince,

1299
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,897
the County Paris,
at St. Peter's church,

1300
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,614
shall happily make thee
there a joyful bride.

1301
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:45,718
Now, by St. Peter's church,
and Peter too,

1302
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:49,579
he shall not make me there
a joyful bride!

1303
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,634
No! No!

1304
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:58,332
So, it is concluded.

1305
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:03,079
Son Paris.

1306
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:10,737
How now, wife. Have you
delivered to her our decree?

1307
01:38:11,542 --> 01:38:16,754
Ay, sir; but she will none,
she gives you thanks.

1308
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,899
I would the fool were
married to her grave!

1309
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:26,851
Soft! Take me with you.

1310
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:30,537
Take me with you, wife.

1311
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:34,095
How! Will she none?

1312
01:38:34,438 --> 01:38:38,038
Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud?

1313
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:41,074
Doth she not count her
blest, unworthy as she is,

1314
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,200
that we have wrought
so worthy a gentleman

1315
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,750
to be her bridegroom?

1316
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:47,677
Wretched fool!
Let me see her!

1317
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:48,950
Ungrateful baggage!

1318
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,035
Graze where thou wilt,
thou shalt not house with me.

1319
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:53,859
Fie! What, are you mad?

1320
01:38:54,834 --> 01:38:56,600
Hang thee, young baggage!

1321
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:57,895
Disobedient wretch!

1322
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,612
I tell thee what, get thee
to church on Thursday,

1323
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,293
or never after
look me in the face.

1324
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:04,350
O, father, good father,
I beseech you.

1325
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,752
Speak not, reply not,
do not answer me.

1326
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,317
My fingers itch.

1327
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:09,517
God in heaven bless her!

1328
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:11,879
You are to blame, my lord,
to rate her so.

1329
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:13,593
And why, my lady wisdom?

1330
01:39:13,707 --> 01:39:14,650
Hold your tongue,

1331
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:16,448
good prudence, smatter
with your gossips, go!

1332
01:39:16,544 --> 01:39:19,714
I speak no treason.
May not one speak?

1333
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:22,100
Peace, you mumbling fool!

1334
01:39:22,161 --> 01:39:23,340
Utter your gravity
o'er a gossip's bowl,

1335
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:24,522
for here we need it not.

1336
01:39:24,618 --> 01:39:27,261
You are too hot.

1337
01:39:27,496 --> 01:39:30,782
God's bread, it makes me mad.

1338
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:37,500
Thursday is near.
Lay hand on heart, advise.

1339
01:39:37,609 --> 01:39:40,387
An you be mine,
I'll give you to my friend.

1340
01:39:40,483 --> 01:39:44,700
An you be not, hang, beg,
starve, die in the streets.

1341
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:45,500
No!

1342
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:47,931
For by my soul,
I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

1343
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,718
nor what is mine
shall never do thee good.

1344
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:52,489
Father!

1345
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:57,018
Trust to't, bethink you,
I'll not be forsworn.

1346
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,451
O no! No!

1347
01:40:05,684 --> 01:40:09,170
O, sweet my mother,
cast me not away!

1348
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:12,200
Delay this marriage
for a month, a week.

1349
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:15,150
Talk not to me,
for I'll not speak a word.

1350
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,200
Do as thou wilt,
for I have done with thee.

1351
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:25,692
O God!

1352
01:40:25,837 --> 01:40:27,596
O nurse!

1353
01:40:28,092 --> 01:40:32,033
How shall this be prevented?
What sayest thou?

1354
01:40:32,129 --> 01:40:35,836
Hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.

1355
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,654
Faith, here it is.

1356
01:40:39,303 --> 01:40:41,506
Romeo is banished.

1357
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:44,822
And all the world to nothing,

1358
01:40:44,922 --> 01:40:47,400
that he dares ne'er come back
to challenge you;

1359
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,536
or, if he do, it needs must
be by stealth.

1360
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:55,775
Then, since the case so stands
as now it doth,

1361
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:00,111
I think it best
you marry with the County.

1362
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,774
True.

1363
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:17,070
O, he's a lovely gentleman.

1364
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:23,735
Romeo's a dishclout to him.

1365
01:41:25,753 --> 01:41:28,335
An eagle, madam,
hath not so green,

1366
01:41:28,431 --> 01:41:31,292
so quick, so fair an eye
as Paris hath.

1367
01:41:32,088 --> 01:41:33,031
Beshrew my heart,

1368
01:41:33,127 --> 01:41:36,089
I think you are happy
in this second match,

1369
01:41:36,785 --> 01:41:38,775
for it excels your first.

1370
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:43,900
Or if it did not,
your first is dead,

1371
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,398
or 'twere as good he were,
as living here,

1372
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,433
and you no use of him.

1373
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:52,973
Speakest thou from thy heart?

1374
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:58,690
And from my soul too;

1375
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,300
or else beshrew them both.

1376
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,772
Amen.

1377
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,173
What?

1378
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:10,691
Well, thou hast comforted me
marvellous much.

1379
01:42:13,876 --> 01:42:17,338
Go in, and tell my lady
I am gone,

1380
01:42:17,934 --> 01:42:20,910
having displeased my father,
to Laurence's cell,

1381
01:42:20,991 --> 01:42:23,673
to make confession
and to be absolved.

1382
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:28,800
Marry, I shall,
and this is wisely done.

1383
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:30,569
Go!

1384
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,870
You say you do not know
the lady's mind.

1385
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:04,211
Uneven is the course,
I like it not.

1386
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:06,936
Immoderately she weeps
for Tybalt's death,

1387
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:09,200
and therefore have I
little talked of love,

1388
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,050
for Venus smiles not
in a house of tears.

1389
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,497
Happily met,
my lady and my wife.

1390
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:31,579
That may be, sir,
when I may be a wife.

1391
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:36,613
Come you to make
confession to this father?

1392
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,499
Are you at leisure,
holy father, now,

1393
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:42,797
or shall I come to you
at evening mass?

1394
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:45,980
My leisure serves me,
pensive daughter, now.

1395
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,500
My lord, we must entreat
the time alone.

1396
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,693
God shield I should
disturb devotion!

1397
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:54,652
Juliet, on Thursday early
will I rouse thee.

1398
01:43:56,336 --> 01:43:58,908
Till then, adieu.

1399
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:04,000
And keep this holy kiss.

1400
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,138
O, shut the door,
and when thou hast done so,

1401
01:44:14,230 --> 01:44:15,900
come weep with me,

1402
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,700
past hope, past care,
past help.

1403
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,673
O, Juliet, I already
know thy grief.

1404
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,318
Tell me not, friar,
that thou hear'st of this,

1405
01:44:35,438 --> 01:44:37,719
unless thou tell me
how I can prevent it.

1406
01:44:37,815 --> 01:44:41,168
If in thy wisdom
thou canst give no help...

1407
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:55,928
Hold, daughter.

1408
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:02,136
I do spy a kind of hope,

1409
01:45:02,220 --> 01:45:05,009
as that is desperate
which we would prevent.

1410
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:09,695
If, rather than to marry
County Paris,

1411
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:10,890
thou hast
the strength of will to...

1412
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:13,200
Bid me leap,
rather than marry Paris,

1413
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:15,400
from off the battlements
of any tower,

1414
01:45:15,448 --> 01:45:17,074
or bid me go
into a new-made grave

1415
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:19,364
and hide me with a dead man
in his shroud.

1416
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:20,960
Hold then.

1417
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,640
Go home,

1418
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,753
be merry.

1419
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:42,400
Give consent to marry Paris.

1420
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,000
O, no.

1421
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,280
Wednesday is tomorrow.

1422
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:52,900
Tomorrow night
look that thou lie alone,

1423
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:56,400
let not the nurse
lie with thee in thy chamber.

1424
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,900
Take thou this phial,
being then in bed,

1425
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:15,000
and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.

1426
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:21,700
When presently through
all thy veins shall run

1427
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,900
a cold and drowsy humour;

1428
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:29,358
for no pulse shall keep his
native progress, but surcease.

1429
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:35,375
No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.

1430
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,400
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death

1431
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,136
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours,

1432
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:57,909
and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1433
01:47:00,009 --> 01:47:05,506
In the meantime,
against thou shalt awake,

1434
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:08,767
shall Romeo by my letters
know our drift,

1435
01:47:08,863 --> 01:47:10,286
and hither shall he come,

1436
01:47:10,382 --> 01:47:12,384
and he and I
will watch thy waking,

1437
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:16,893
and that very night shall Romeo
bear thee hence to Mantua.

1438
01:47:18,915 --> 01:47:20,854
Give me, give me!

1439
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,060
Tell me not of fear.

1440
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,236
Hold, then.

1441
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:37,529
Get thee gone, be strong and
prosperous in this resolve.

1442
01:48:12,576 --> 01:48:14,298
How now, my headstrong.

1443
01:48:14,494 --> 01:48:16,117
Where have you been gadding?

1444
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:18,200
Where I have learned me
to repent the sin

1445
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,800
of disobedient opposition.

1446
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:23,934
Pardon me.

1447
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:27,529
Henceforward I am ever
ruled by you.

1448
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:30,151
Why, I am glad on't!

1449
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:32,575
This is well. Stand up.

1450
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,253
This is as it should be.

1451
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:12,671
Love, give me strength!

1452
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:41,195
Give this letter into
the hand of Romeo, in Mantua.

1453
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:18,698
My lord! My lord!

1454
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:21,350
She's dead, Juliet is dead!

1455
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:24,539
My lady Juliet, my lord.
She's dead, she's dead!

1456
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:26,277
Juliet!

1457
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,449
Juliet!

1458
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,999
Juliet!

1459
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:31,796
My baby, where is she?

1460
01:50:35,933 --> 01:50:38,274
O, lamentable day!

1461
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:42,207
Death lies on her
like an untimely frost

1462
01:50:42,707 --> 01:50:46,812
upon the sweetest flower
of all the field.

1463
01:52:56,820 --> 01:52:57,830
Master.

1464
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:59,090
Balthasar!

1465
01:53:02,462 --> 01:53:04,001
How fares my Juliet?

1466
01:53:04,401 --> 01:53:06,771
For nothing can be ill,
if she be well.

1467
01:53:07,767 --> 01:53:09,553
How fares my lady?

1468
01:53:21,648 --> 01:53:25,189
She's dead, my lord.
She's dead.

1469
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:28,814
Her body sleeps
in Capel's monument.

1470
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,050
I saw her laid low
in her kindred's vault.

1471
01:53:42,580 --> 01:53:45,094
Then I defy you, stars!

1472
01:55:06,489 --> 01:55:07,448
Live...

1473
01:55:08,583 --> 01:55:11,053
and be prosperous.

1474
01:55:12,349 --> 01:55:14,451
Farewell, good fellow.

1475
01:56:20,053 --> 01:56:21,801
Juliet.

1476
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,931
O, my love!

1477
01:57:16,060 --> 01:57:17,859
My wife.

1478
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:22,252
Death, that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath,

1479
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,375
hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.

1480
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:33,117
Thou art not conquered.

1481
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:40,214
Beauty's ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips

1482
01:57:41,260 --> 01:57:43,098
and in thy cheeks.

1483
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,491
Death's pale flag
is not advanced there.

1484
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:54,879
Tybalt.

1485
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:03,169
Liest thou there
in thy bloody sheet?

1486
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:17,061
What more favour
can I do to thee,

1487
01:58:17,957 --> 01:58:21,778
than with that hand
that cut thy youth in twain

1488
01:58:22,174 --> 01:58:27,242
to sunder his
that was thine enemy?

1489
01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:36,188
Forgive me, cousin.

1490
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,976
Ah, dear Juliet.

1491
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:55,729
Why art thou yet so fair?

1492
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:01,793
Shall I believe that
unsubstantial death is amorous,

1493
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:03,500
and that the lean
abhorred monster

1494
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:06,092
keeps thee here in dark
to be his paramour?

1495
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:12,610
For fear of that,
I still will stay with thee.

1496
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:22,129
Never from this palace
of dim night depart again.

1497
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:28,288
Here, here will I remain

1498
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:35,896
with worms that are
thy chamber-maids.

1499
01:59:51,700 --> 01:59:55,078
Eyes, look your last!

1500
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:04,456
Arms, take your last embrace!

1501
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:11,599
And lips,
o you the doors of breath,

1502
02:00:11,716 --> 02:00:13,500
seal with a righteous kiss

1503
02:00:13,534 --> 02:00:16,720
a dateless bargain
to engrossing death!

1504
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:55,334
Here's to my love!

1505
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:25,969
Thus with a kiss...

1506
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:29,012
I die.

1507
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:42,000
Who's there?

1508
02:01:42,100 --> 02:01:44,948
A friend, and one
that knows you well.

1509
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:48,074
Balthasar! How long
hast thou been here?

1510
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:49,574
Full half an hour.

1511
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:51,135
Go with me to the vault.

1512
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:53,100
I dare not, sir.

1513
02:01:53,179 --> 02:01:55,961
My master knows not
but I am gone hence.

1514
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:59,290
Stay, then, I'll go alone.

1515
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:02,859
Fear comes upon me.

1516
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:06,035
O, much I fear
some ill unlucky thing.

1517
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:45,379
Romeo!

1518
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,400
Pale!

1519
02:02:55,073 --> 02:02:57,296
O, what an unkind hour

1520
02:02:57,392 --> 02:03:01,045
is guilty of this
lamentable chance!

1521
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:55,673
O, comfortable friar,
where is my lord?

1522
02:03:57,880 --> 02:04:00,414
I do remember well
where I should be,

1523
02:04:00,704 --> 02:04:02,727
and there I am.

1524
02:04:03,023 --> 02:04:05,145
Where is my Romeo?

1525
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,300
I hear some noise.

1526
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:11,050
Where is my Romeo?

1527
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:14,413
O, lady, come from this nest
of death, contagion,

1528
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:16,289
and unnatural sleep.

1529
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:20,009
A greater power
than we can contradict

1530
02:04:20,129 --> 02:04:22,068
hath thwarted our intents.

1531
02:04:22,620 --> 02:04:24,929
Come along.
The watch is coming.

1532
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,049
Where is my Romeo?

1533
02:04:33,300 --> 02:04:36,091
Come, go, good Juliet.

1534
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:37,650
No.

1535
02:04:37,740 --> 02:04:39,229
I dare no longer stay.

1536
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:40,576
No!

1537
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:43,497
I dare no longer stay.

1538
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,555
Juliet!

1539
02:04:47,709 --> 02:04:49,611
I dare no longer stay.

1540
02:04:49,707 --> 02:04:52,209
I dare no longer stay!

1541
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:33,692
What's here?

1542
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:41,932
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

1543
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:47,800
O churl!

1544
02:05:47,964 --> 02:05:49,946
Drunk all,
and left no friendly drop

1545
02:05:50,042 --> 02:05:52,564
to help me after?

1546
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:55,500
I will kiss thy lips;

1547
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:57,516
haply, some poison
yet doth hang on them,

1548
02:05:57,557 --> 02:06:00,239
to make me die
with a restorative.

1549
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:07,778
Thy lips are warm!

1550
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:21,519
O no, no!

1551
02:06:31,811 --> 02:06:33,200
Lead, boy. Which way?

1552
02:06:33,230 --> 02:06:35,252
Search about the churchyard.

1553
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:38,912
Yea, noise?

1554
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,194
No!

1555
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:50,500
Then I'll be brief.

1556
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,500
O, happy dagger!

1557
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:57,312
This is thy sheath;

1558
02:06:57,408 --> 02:07:00,169
there rust, and let me die.

1559
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:48,810
Where be these enemies?

1560
02:08:50,940 --> 02:08:52,800
Capulet.

1561
02:08:56,100 --> 02:08:58,173
Montague.

1562
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:08,935
See, what a scourge
is laid upon your hates,

1563
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:14,977
that heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love.

1564
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:23,437
And I, for winking
at your discords too,

1565
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,775
have lost a brace of kinsmen.

1566
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:34,460
All are punished.

1567
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:41,240
All are punished!

1568
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:15,200
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings,

1569
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,300
The sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1570
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:24,500
For never was a story
of more woe,

1571
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:30,319
Than this of Juliet
and her Romeo.
