<i>No tommorow, no tommorow</i>

10
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:58,914
<i>And I find it kind of funny</i>

11
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:01,295
<i>I find it kind of sad</i>

<i>The dreams in which I'm dying</i>

13

<i>Are the best I've ever had</i>

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,759
<i>I find it hard to tell you</i>

<i>'Cos I find it hard to take</i>

Money on the visor.
It wasn't a robbery.

35
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:44,892
Dirt clods on the floor mat look undisturbed.

36
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,766
Could be from the last fare.

37
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:49,357
I don't see any shell casings, though.

38
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:53,231
Partition's closed.
Bullet-proof glass.

39
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,570
He was not shot from inside.

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,229
Well, I got two bullet holes
in the passenger door.

41
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:13,513
That's a weird side of the car for a drive-by.

42
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:16,206
Maybe he wasn't shot here.
Maybe he just ended up here.

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,455
Excuse me.

44
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:24,650
- Are you with the Transit Board ?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,566
Do you have the dispatch log ?

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,212
Thanks.

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,813
Why's he leaving ?

48
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:48,906
Well, that's kind of what he does.

49
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:53,774
- Is this camera always on ?
- Only on HBO.

50
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:56,102
It takes stills for ten seconds
when the door opens,

51
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,785
and then for the first ten seconds of the fare.

52
00:03:57,785 --> 00:03:59,689
We're gonna need the pictures.

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,968
- This is Catherine.
- It's Gil.

54
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:09,903
- How you doing ?
- I'm busy.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,778
- Checking up on me ?
- Why would I need to do that ?

56
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:14,120
You tell me.

57
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:18,369
Look, I know you tend to get a little
territorial about your crime scenes,

58
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:21,053
and I don't want there
to be any tension between us,

59
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,172
so I'm giving you fair warning.

60
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:25,168
Fair warning for what ?

61
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,237
Hi !

62
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,548
Julian Harper.

63
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,683
If it weren't for the cyanosis,
I'd say he was doing a photo shoot for GQ.

64
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,667
Yeah, I'm sure
he wasn't ready for this photo shoot.

65
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,731
Body temp's 95.

66
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,982
That would make T.O.D.
approximately 3:00 a.m.

67
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,312
Well, there's plenty of drugs around here.
You think he OD'd ?

68
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,009
Yeah, no edema.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,557
Some petechia.

70
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:15,232
Could be suffocation or strangulation.

71
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:19,903
But no ligature marks or bruising.
However...

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,352
some fibers under the chin.

73
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,969
- What are you doing ?
- It's for my scrapbook.

74
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:44,115
I've got a perfect spot for him...
A place of honor between Tupac and Entwhistle.

75
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,740
The taxi's last dropoff was this address.

76
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,249
This guy's got dirt on his shoes and pants.

77
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:55,285
There was dirt in the cab.
He's got to be the last fare.

78
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:57,652
So, somebody killed them both.

79
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:02,862
And if it's about money,
doesn't look like this guy has much.

80
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,765
Well, I guess it's relative.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,137
It depends on who you are.

Samay...
Samay Thao.

84
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,679
15527 East Charleston Road.
That's a long way from here.

85
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,439
I count 6 shots in his chest.

86
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:59,907
There were two in the cab,
one in the cabbie.

87
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:03,718
If the math is correct,
that's nine.

88
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:06,754
Suggests semi-automatic,
but I don't see any shell casings here.

89
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:08,929
Yeah, there were none in the taxi, either.

90
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,936
Killer could have picked them up.

91
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,402
To shoot a guy six times in the torso,

92
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,622
you either have to be very close,
or a hell of a shot.

93
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:18,756
- It's okay if I roll him ?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,497
Well, no through and throughs.

95
00:07:26,497 --> 00:07:29,268
We should be able to recover
some bullets from the body.

96
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,114
Hang on.

97
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,048
What do you make of that ?

98
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:36,926
Looks like he rubbed up
against something.

99
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:45,225
Could be transfert from that railing.

100
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,721
We got blood drops.

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,517
This looks fresh.

102
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,319
Hey, Brass ?

103
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,740
Las Vegas Police !
Put the gun down !

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,460
Put the gun down !
Put it down.

105
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,623
I shoot... burglar !

106
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,527
Julian Harper.

107
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,779
Wasn't he supposed to be like...
the next Brad Pitt or something ?

108
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,813
Yeah.
Now he's the next River Phoenix.

109
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,880
- All right, Gerald.
- They call me Blinky.

110
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,157
And what was your relation to Julian Harper ?

111
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,225
Best friends since kindergarten.

112
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,810
- Now I work for him.
- What did you do for him ?

113
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,741
Pretty much everything.
You know,

114
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:32,436
bought his stuff, hooked him up.

115
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:34,645
- Drove him to meetings.
- Did you find the body ?

116
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,276
I ordered room service.

117
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,259
I wanted to see if he was hungry.

118
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,378
Boom, there he was.

119
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:43,476
Did you touch or move the body
in any way ?

120
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:46,166
No way. No.
I watch those murder shows, you know ?

121
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,470
I know to just keep my hands to myself,
and call the cops.

122
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,438
What is with the robe ?

123
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,279
Did you pat him down ?

124
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,582
He's packing a small, friendly weapon.

125
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,809
Would you mind standing up for us, sir ?

126
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:04,437
Nah, bro, I... I... I... kind of got the angle of the dangle going.

127
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,913
- The boing, boing, boing.
- Stand up.

128
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,813
I took a Prevalis on the plane over.

129
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:19,756
I been pitching a tent for, like, eight hours.

130
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:22,637
Yeah, I... I think I need to consult a physician.

131
00:10:22,637 --> 00:10:25,710
It's called a priapism.
Just in case you were wondering.

132
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,565
- What else are you on, man ?
- Nothing.

133
00:10:28,565 --> 00:10:31,574
I mean, I smoked a little herb
at the club, but that's it.

134
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:32,790
What about Julian ?

135
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,041
Jules ? No, he...
he won't even take aspirin.

136
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,850
You know, he's organic. You know,
treats his body like a temple.

137
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,308
Well, we're gonna need
a list of everyone

138
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,303
who was here worshipping the temple.

139
00:10:42,718 --> 00:10:45,100
- Can I sit down ?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,764
Did someone turn a shower on
or something ?

141
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:50,797
You cleared that room, right ?

142
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:11,417
Are you okay ?

143
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,917
We need a medic !

144
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,895
And a bag for stomach contents.

145
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:27,092
His name is Keo Vipraxay.

146
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:29,876
He barely speaks English.
He's South Asian, I think.

147
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:31,899
Anyway, it's all clear.

148
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,020
Thanks, Jim.

149
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,447
Double-aught buck.

150
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:49,950
Standard shot is nine pellets.

151
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,675
That would account for all the hits.

152
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,818
So you're saying that a single shotgun blast,
through a security door,

153
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:02,755
took out two separate victims
in two separate locations ?

154
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,932
Weird ?

155
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,420
The cab drops Samay Thao
in front of this building.

156
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,771
And the position of the blood drops
give us a pretty good idea

157
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,044
of where Samay was standing when he was shot.

158
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,190
He was a little shorter than me.

159
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,866
Shots were centered
on his chest, about there.

160
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:24,587
My guess is,
the cab was parked down there,

161
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:26,520
the driver peeled out when he got shot.

162
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:37,751
Vertical deflection down
to the cab is roughly 60 degrees.

163
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,746
Standard shot won't spread that far.

164
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:43,148
The pellets must have come through the screen.

165
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,614
The old billiard ball effect.

166
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:55,154
The cab driver was collateral damage.

167
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:59,688
But the man with the shotgun said
he shot a burglar.

168
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,567
What's here to steal ?

169
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,266
Semen on the bed sheets, as well as
every other flat surface in here.

170
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,962
Yeah.

171
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,585
I've got vodka, champagne, cocaine...

172
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:18,706
Hey, hey.

173
00:13:19,021 --> 00:13:20,312
Pantyhose.

174
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,805
I've got some smudges over here.

175
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,277
I've got some footprints.

176
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,114
Looks like someone
was standing right there.

177
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:55,019
Was this guy just doing it
all over the hotel room ?

178
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,920
If those are his footprints...

179
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:00,882
where are hers ?

180
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,419
Or her feet were up...

181
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:04,869
in the air.

182
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:07,195
You tell me...
You just had your honeymoon.

183
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,678
You want to swab this ?

184
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,147
I just don't understand.

185
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:20,142
I mean, who would want to kill Julian ?

186
00:14:20,763 --> 00:14:22,469
I mean, he'd had some weird fan mail,

187
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:25,630
but I don't think any of those kind of people
would be able to get in his suite.

188
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,977
Were you in his suite ?

189
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:30,583
The ex-wife isn't exactly
the best person to have around

190
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:31,900
when you're looking to get laid.

191
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:34,264
Was that your choice or his ?

192
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:38,015
It was mutual.
I'm strictly his manager now.

193
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:40,911
So if you weren't in his suite,
where did you go ?

194
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:43,637
I was taking care of business.

195
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,069
Checked the boys in,

196
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,169
made sure the suite was copasetic,

197
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,332
had a drink at Skin,

198
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:54,392
and played pai gow
until hotel security came to get me.

199
00:14:54,798 --> 00:14:57,193
So how did you get to be his manager ?

200
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,444
When I was with him,
he was broke.

201
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,080
Then after the divorce, I still...

202
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,718
did his laundry, paid his bills,
read his scripts.

203
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:10,312
After a while, I wanted to get paid.

204
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:13,365
Now I get ten percent of everything.

205
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,457
Look...

206
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,576
I need to make some calls.
Julian's parents, the studio...

207
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,819
Can we talk about this later ?

208
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:25,117
Sure. But I need your prints
and your DNA now.

209
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,869
Tox shows low levels of cocaine,
alcohol and Prevalis.

210
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:31,523
Rules out overdose.

211
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:35,692
Really ? I guess he was just acting
about the clean-living part.

212
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,771
- C.O.D.* ? (* Cause Of Death)
- Asphyxia.

213
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,096
- Asphyxiated how ?
- I don't know.

214
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,879
No broken hyoid.

215
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,001
That and the absence of ligature marks
or bruises makes strangulation unlikely.

216
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:48,500
Did you find any fibers
in his nose or mouth ?

217
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,895
Nope.
That doesn't rule out suffocation.

218
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,388
Killer could have used something
that didn't shed fibers.

219
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:57,067
Or maybe they came from whoever he was rolling around with in bed.

220
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:01,280
Found lubricant on his genitals,
probably from a condom,

221
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,873
and minor abrasions on his penis,

222
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:06,598
indicative of vigorous,
prolonged activity.

223
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,611
Sex, drugs and movies : the American dream.

224
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:25,125
Your stomach contents contain
alcohol and traces of triazolam.

225
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,529
Try-as-a-what ?

226
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:29,513
It's a sleeping pill, has you reading
the inside of your eyelids for a week.

227
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:31,073
I didn't take any pills.

228
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,310
We also found cocaine in your bloodstream.

229
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,265
I guess you didn't take that, either ?

230
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,236
So I did a couple of lines,
but I didn't take any pills.

231
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:44,591
If I was gonna take a pill,
I would've popped E or a perc.

232
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:47,508
Miss Villa, we found you
in Julian Harper's suite.

233
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,295
Were you ever in his bedroom ?

234
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:51,568
Who knows ?

235
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:54,453
I don't even know how
I ended up in Blinky's room.

236
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,404
Oh, my... I swear,
if that guy slipped me something...

237
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,471
Tell us what you do remember.

238
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,532
Me and my girls were at Skin, and, uh...

239
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,904
Blinky came over and said
he was partying with Julian Harper.

240
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:19,216
And he said they had this pimpy booth,
so we went over.

241
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,143
It didn't turn out the way I hoped.

242
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,480
And the next thing I know,
Blinky's on top of me.

243
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,878
We could assist you
in reporting a date rape.

244
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,349
- Thanks, but no.
- It's not an offer, it's our job.

245
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,799
There's this Stuff magazine
party at Ghost Bar tonight.

246
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,488
I'm not gonna make it harder
for me to get in

247
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:50,304
because I tattled on
Julian Harper's best friend.

248
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,517
- I mean, if I run into them tonight...
- Julian Harper will not be there.

249
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:56,136
Trust me, he will.

250
00:17:56,136 --> 00:18:00,474
The coroner finished the autopsy
early this morning.

251
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:05,196
- He's dead ?
- Yeah.

252
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:11,488
I was in Julian Harper's suite
when he died ?

253
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:13,926
You're kidding me, right ?

254
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,442
And being in his suite
makes you a suspect.

255
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,944
- I am ?
- Yes.

256
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,590
So we're going to need to take
a sample of your DNA.

257
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,177
Man.

258
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,242
I am so getting into that party
tonight for sure.

259
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,937
Yeah, I remember that guy.

260
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:40,297
He's, like, Chinese or something,
real spun out.

261
00:18:40,297 --> 00:18:41,730
He was on meth ?

262
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,131
Well, he was on something.
He was acting all shady.

263
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:48,608
Downed a bottle of soda
before he even paid for it.

264
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:50,921
And that's how you knew
he was on something ?

265
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,418
There ain't nothin' out here.

266
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:55,479
People here act messed up
because they are messed up.

267
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:59,743
The Metro Transit Board said that he caught
a Sunstar Taxi from this address.

268
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:01,276
I called it for him.

269
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:03,154
Anything to get that tweaker out of here.

270
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:05,513
Any idea how he got here
in the first place ?

271
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:08,315
All I saw him do was walk
through the door.

272
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,909
Samay Thao.

273
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:13,554
I don't even need to open him up
to guess C.O.D.

274
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,745
Ocular inflammation.

275
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,089
Laceration of the sclera.

276
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,298
Hurts like hell when you get
a grain of sand in your eye.

277
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,419
Imagine this.

278
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,628
Bad night for Laotians.

279
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:46,284
What other Laotians are having
a bad night ?

280
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:50,815
Solo traffic collision on Mount Charleston.

281
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,440
Came in early this morning.

282
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,415
Noy Vipraxay.

283
00:19:55,215 --> 00:19:56,506
Vipraxay ?

284
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,036
- Well, that's a hell of a coincidence.
- Does it mean something to you ?

285
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,531
Yeah, he's got the same last name
as the guy who shot him.

286
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:09,237
In fact, Grissom said that our vic over there
caught a cab at a gas station

287
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:11,132
near Mount Charleston.

288
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:13,149
I'll have auto detail bring in his car.

289
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:15,027
Sounds like your double's becoming a triple.

290
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:17,251
Unless you got any more in your drawers ?

291
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,027
Hey, Archie.

292
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:20,564
See if you can help me out.

293
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:23,500
There was a smear on the window at the hotel.

294
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,807
It came back saliva.

295
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:31,121
So I ran it through CODIS, got a hit,
felony battery on this guy, Willie Angel.

296
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:34,959
Now, he's a Las Vegas resident, but he wasn't a
registered guest at the hotel.

297
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:39,219
He has no affiliation with Julian's
little entourage whatsoever.

298
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,050
I think I scoped this guy earlier.

299
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,219
- Really ?
- Yeah.
- Do it up.

300
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:51,267
Yeah, there he is.

301
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,390
- Looking dapper.
- All right.

302
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:59,673
12:31 a.m.
Gets off on the high-roller floor.

303
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,523
Hey, 2:45 a.m.

304
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,180
Shopping bags ?

305
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,939
There's no mall on that floor.
He was shopping at Julian Harper's.

306
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:20,153
Enough time to shop and kill.

307
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,779
The Palms issued two card keys...

308
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,604
One to Julian, and one to his boy Blinky.

309
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,338
But the database shows...

310
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:30,618
one, two...

311
00:21:30,618 --> 00:21:33,878
three keys were used to access the suite ?

312
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:36,572
Well, assuming the third card was Willie's.

313
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,804
You can't just walk up to the front desk and
pull the "I lost my key" scam on a VIP suite.

314
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,614
So... how'd Willie get it ?

315
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,040
Sorry.

316
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,969
I just started seeing someone.
Had a bit of a late night.

317
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:58,386
Let me ask you something.

318
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:02,749
How do you know when it's gone
from just friends to more than ?

319
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:07,730
Well, if you have to ask...
It's just friends.

320
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,627
She is making dinner for me this weekend.

321
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:11,550
Are you the only guest ?

322
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,516
Do her roommates count ?

323
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,905
The splinter from your vic's eye
has four distinct layers.

324
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:23,910
Polycarbonate plastic, aluminum,
acrylic and dye.

325
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,630
Being an audiophile,
I prefer the sound of vinyl.

326
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,527
It's from a compact disc ?

327
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,121
Well, how did it end up in Samay Thao's eye ?

328
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:39,898
Noy Vipraxay's car.

329
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:41,895
Easy for you to say.

330
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:43,669
Find anything ?

331
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:45,755
Take a look at this.

332
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:50,064
Gravitational pooling directly
under the steering wheel.

333
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,758
The car was found at the bottom
of a steep incline.

334
00:22:57,758 --> 00:23:00,543
So he was leaning over it
when he bled out.

335
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,100
Except he wasn't.

336
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,760
Take a look.
See this.

337
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:07,799
If he'd have bled out
in the position he was found,

338
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,684
there'd be blood on the door,
not under the steering wheel.

339
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,705
So someone moved the body ?

340
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:22,296
There was plenty of mud at the scene,
and Samay had mud on his pants.

341
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:25,481
Maybe we can match soil samples.

342
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,960
Hang on.

343
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,614
Trace came back on the splinter
that was in Samay's eye.

344
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,777
It was a CD fragment.

345
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,887
- Samay was in this car.
- Hey, guys.

346
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:47,021
I got work card hits off prints from
the two dead Laotians and the shooter.

347
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,058
We already know their IDs.

348
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:51,322
Well, did you already know
that they all worked together ?

349
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,924
- So Samay Thao worked for you ?
- Yeah, runs the dryers.

350
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:01,746
When was the last time you saw him ?

351
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,834
He's been off a couple days now.

352
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:09,498
Did you know Noy or Keo Vipraxay ?

353
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:11,281
Sure.
They work here, too.

354
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:13,140
They brothers or cousins, or what ?

355
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,097
Brothers. Keo's older.
I hear they got six more back in Laos.

356
00:24:18,097 --> 00:24:20,441
They work swing...
They're on at 4:00.

357
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:25,019
- Were they friends of Samay's ?
- No ! No way.

358
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:29,043
Keo and Noy are Lao Loum.
They're lowlanders.

359
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:32,326
Samay's Hmong, he's in the hills.
They're born to hate each other.

360
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:34,560
Some tribal crap.

361
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,724
What kind of trouble are they in ?

362
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,421
The kind where you stop breathing.

363
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,166
Noy's dead... car accident. Samay's dead,
too... Keo shot him.

364
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:59,522
- You speak Lao ?
- And Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalog.

365
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:01,543
I pulled a stint straight out of high school.

366
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,953
I got Southeast Asia, lucky me.

367
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:06,924
- Yeah, I know how you feel.
- Did Keo tell you what happened ?

368
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,302
I mean, his English isn't very good.

369
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
No, we're...
We're still waiting on an interpreter.

370
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,460
If you need any help,
you let me know.

371
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,303
Yeah, maybe...
Maybe I'll take you up on that.

372
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,256
Willie Angel ?

373
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:56,003
You can't fool the eye in the sky, Willie.

374
00:25:56,003 --> 00:25:58,157
There's a lot of people looking for you.

375
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:01,958
Okay, you got me.
What do you want ?

376
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,068
Hey, what are you doing ?

377
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,213
- Hey, you can't do that.
- Oh, this here says we can.

378
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:14,628
Slick Willie.

379
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,441
Look out now.

380
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:20,066
- You collect card keys, Willie ?
- I won at those places.

381
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,750
- Really ?
- I hang on to them for good luck.

382
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,925
Well, I bet you're real lucky with this cheap
magnetic stripe reader and palmtop ?

383
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:28,646
You know you can get into most hotel rooms
in the city with this thing ?

384
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:34,823
You take the old card key, you input the
room number, a little magnetic encoding...

385
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,581
and Bob's your uncle.

386
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,479
You used the card key to open the door.
Scopped around and hide.

387
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,784
Julian comes back, falls asleep,

388
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:51,795
and you tried to rob him blind
but he woke up.

389
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:54,485
Kill him or go back to jail.
Right ?

390
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:58,206
- Who the hell are you ?
- Stop, okay ? Stop.

391
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,330
I was in his suite.
And, yeah, I'm a thief.

392
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,820
But I didn't kill anybody.

393
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,445
You were in his suite
for over two hours, man.

394
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:12,584
That's more than enough time to snag
a couple shopping bags.

395
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:15,836
'Cause that sick,
rich freak wasn't going to sleep.

396
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:19,959
He was banging some blonde for,
like, two hours.

397
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,308
- Talk to her.
- We're talking to you.

398
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:27,991
I don't know what the hell
they were doing,

399
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:30,305
but when she left, he wasn't moving.

400
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:32,219
I thought he was asleep.

401
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,413
Then I saw the news this morning.

402
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,077
If it's a killer you're looking for,
talk to the girl in the red dress.

403
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:46,300
We believe that Samay Thao killed your brother
and tried to make it look like an accident.

404
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,158
Did you know about it ?

405
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,801
He says he thought Samay was there to rob
him.

406
00:28:32,801 --> 00:28:35,154
That's why he shot him.

407
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,822
The girl in the red dress gets off
with Julian's entourage at 12:57.

408
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:56,322
Then she gets back on at 2:33.

409
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:59,055
Certainly looks like
she's been through something rough.

410
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,095
She forgot her pantyhose.

411
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,448
- Good eyes.
- Great legs.

412
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,836
Been a while, Arch.

413
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:10,999
- Can you follow her out ?
- Yeah.

414
00:29:11,406 --> 00:29:12,489
I just got this footage...

415
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:14,666
Hey, I heard you guys are having trouble
with the Julian Harper case.

416
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:17,461
- Who'd you hear that from ?
- Ecklie. He's putting me on it.

417
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:19,707
Man, you gotta quit kissing his ass.

418
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,487
All right, fellas, check this out.

419
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,928
Okay, that's Julian's manager.

420
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,441
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.

421
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,516
That's got to be at least a few Gs.

422
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:42,789
- She a hooker ?
- I don't know, I think she could be the killer.

423
00:29:43,173 --> 00:29:45,250
Solicitation murder ?

424
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,145
Manager pays to have her client whacked.

425
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:52,396
- She went shopping.
- Wait a minute.

426
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:56,163
What kind of hired killer takes their payoff
and goes to the mall ?

427
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:57,834
I don't know.

428
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,408
This one put herself on a mailing list.

429
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:05,433
Tally Jordan.

430
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:06,915
There's the phone number.

431
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,602
You call my cell, I answer, we talk.

432
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:16,142
And then you guys show up and arrest me at
the pool, in front of my friends.

433
00:30:16,142 --> 00:30:17,327
Is that fair ?

434
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:19,962
You left Julian Harper's room at 2:33.

435
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:22,285
A couple of minutes later,
you're taking money from his manager.

436
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:28,118
- I'm not a prostitute.
- Couple hours later, Julian's dead.

437
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,681
Okay, this is crazy.

438
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:37,191
I would never even think
of killing Julian Harper.

439
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:40,234
I've been a fan of his since
he was doing cereal commercials.

440
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:43,072
So you stalked him ?
Is that it ?

441
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,198
And then you killed him ?

442
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,959
I'm in Vegas for a speech tournament...

443
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:54,342
Okay, a school-supervised trip.

444
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,421
Does that mean that my schoo
is stalking him, too ?

445
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,800
Is the club Skin on your school schedule ?

446
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,380
When I found out that Julian
was going to be in Vegas

447
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,495
at the same time I was, I freaked.

448
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,569
Okay, I wanted a look, an autograph,
or a picture at most.

449
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:22,021
And what I got was incredible.

450
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,890
Go for it.
You're the one he wants.

451
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,409
It was like I was in one of his movies.

452
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,919
Until he kicked me out of bed and...

453
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,536
and then I get off the elevator,
and there's his manager handing me a wad of money.

454
00:31:44,872 --> 00:31:48,171
I tip all the girls Julian's with.

455
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:51,209
So you're his pimp ?

456
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,322
It keeps them
from running their mouths.

457
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:56,763
It protects Julian's image.
It's just a part of managing his career.

458
00:31:56,763 --> 00:31:58,952
I had sex with Julian
because I wanted to.

459
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:02,708
But you took the money,
and you bought a purse with it.

460
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,880
I had a conversation with Julian's lawyer.

461
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,483
And he said you weren't only his ex-wife,

462
00:32:08,483 --> 00:32:10,988
you were about to be his ex-manager.

463
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:12,429
That piss you off ?

464
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,810
His lawyers and his agents don't like me.

465
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,582
They pressured him to drop me.

466
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:22,109
But Julian and I are family.
That wasn't going to happen.

467
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,812
Eva said if anyone asked,
Julian was a gentleman.

468
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:30,047
Later he took me out and got me
a Katherine Baumann purse.

469
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,872
It's a much better story to tell my friends.

470
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,740
Samay and Noy go for a drive after work.

471
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,998
They stop at Mount Charleston.

472
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,777
Samay kills Noy...

473
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,769
...and makes it look like an accident.

474
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:06,525
And then he goes to Keo's apartment
and Keo shoots him, claiming self defense.

475
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:07,451
I don't buy it.

476
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:10,626
Keo shot him from the other side
of a locked door.

477
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:12,439
He was waiting to blow the guy away.

478
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:15,756
Which indicates that Keo
knew Samay was coming.

479
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:20,314
Maybe he hired Samay to kill his brother,
and then he decided to cut him out of the deal.

480
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:25,484
Noy had a life insurance policy issued
through his union, worth ten grand.

481
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:28,129
Life's getting cheaper.
Who's the beneficiary ?

482
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:33,890
Keo was the primary, but check this out.
Half the payout goes to Joe Cavanaugh.

483
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:38,837
He's not a court-approved translator.

484
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:40,428
That's why I taped it.

485
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:42,428
I just didn't tell him.

486
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:46,874
So far, he's saying what you asked him.

487
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:51,281
- "You must help me."
- "That's why I'm here."

488
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,007
"Just tell them what they want to know."

489
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:56,952
This is the part that's different.

490
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,691
"There are many things
I can tell him about you,"

491
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:06,891
"so you tell him this :
Samay came to my home."

492
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:08,382
"I was afraid."

493
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:10,857
"I thought he was there to rob me or kill me."

494
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:12,055
"So I shot him."

495
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:14,353
So our interpreter is hiding something.

496
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:16,759
Well, that's not lost in translation.

497
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,671
Mr. Cavanaugh, can you come out here, please ?

498
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,459
We're going to have a private chat.
Let's go.

499
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:44,501
In the interview, remember Keo said :

500
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:47,918
"There are many things
I can tell them about you" ?

501
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,461
You didn't tell me that.
You left that part out. Why ?

502
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:52,175
I told you what he said.

503
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:54,927
You're not arresting me
because I screwed up my translation ?

504
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:58,328
You're a co-beneficiary of
Noy Vipraxay's life insurance, right ?

505
00:34:58,328 --> 00:34:59,531
So what ?

506
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:03,249
I help my guys try to get
a little security for their families.

507
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:04,752
I help them in a lot of ways.

508
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,684
Out of the goodness of your heart ?

509
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:11,201
Come on, they have to come to you.

510
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:14,222
Without me, they're back in a rice paddy
making three cents a day.

511
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:16,863
Look, some of these guys
put me on their policy.

512
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:18,140
It's their way of saying "thank you."

513
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,389
So when one of your guys kills another one
of your guys, you make money out of it ?

514
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:23,169
We both know that insurance companies

515
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,645
don't even investigate claims
under ten grand.

516
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,701
So you get a free pass.

517
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:30,381
You don't really think I'd have somebody
killed for five grand ?

518
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:33,368
- I've seen it done for a lot less.
- That don't mean I did it.

519
00:35:34,575 --> 00:35:37,261
There's new casinos that open all the time.

520
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,154
They all got laundries.

521
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:42,090
I bring home 15 G's a month on the side.

522
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:46,149
So I am not going to bend over a dollar to
pick up a dime.

523
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:53,632
Hodges, do you have the results on the
fibers that we dropped off to... ?

524
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,676
Hodges ?

525
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,712
He's asleep.

526
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,373
Let me guess, the fibers are wool !

527
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:12,163
Are you bagging Z's right now, man ?

528
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:14,493
- I was just having the greatest dream.
- You were out.

529
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:16,541
It was the '80s and I had this Don Johnson beard,

530
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,900
you know, the "Miami Vice" stubble.

531
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:22,856
It just gave me this air of danger.
My lady loved it.

532
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,298
I found two types of fibers
on your guy's chin.

533
00:36:29,298 --> 00:36:33,546
Cotton and a polyester-lycra blend.
Both dyed black.

534
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:36,580
Dyed black ?

535
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:39,634
The bedding might have been cotton,
but it wasn't black.

536
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:43,542
The comforter and draperies may have been
poly, but they weren't black, either.

537
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:47,058
I bagged some black socks
and some black pantyhose.

538
00:36:47,912 --> 00:36:50,560
This could be the source of the fibers.

539
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,735
He wasn't suffocated with his crew sock.

540
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,813
Did you notice the burn mark on the knot
in these pantyhose at the crime scene ?

541
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,287
No.
No, they were all balled up.

542
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,521
I just bagged them and tagged them.

543
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,215
Oh, yeah.

544
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,795
Yeah, we've got to get this to DNA.

545
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,633
I thought Greg was in the field.
Is he back in the lab ?

546
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,492
- I don't know.
- We've got to clear this up.

547
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:24,435
It's like he's confused.
Lab, field, field, lab.

548
00:37:24,435 --> 00:37:27,322
- We have a lab on wheels.
- How about you guys just shut up ?

549
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:31,317
I'm doing this as a favor for Ecklie.
It's a one-time thing.

550
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:34,848
- He's still interviewing lab techs.
- You making overtime ?

551
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,042
I'm taking one for the team.

552
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:39,547
Tell me about these pantyhose.

553
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:42,684
Well, I found Tally's epithelials on the inside,

554
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:45,569
which is no surprise,
since she was wearing them.

555
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:49,096
I also found black cotton fibers
on the outside...

556
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:52,082
highest concentration near the crotch.
Insert joke here.

557
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:54,080
The vic had a pair of black cotton socks.

558
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,530
Well, I did find black cotton fibers
under his chin.

559
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:03,128
Okay, transfer from the sock
to the pantyhose, to the neck.

560
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:07,097
So the sock was in
between the pantyhose and the neck ?

561
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:08,008
Padding.

562
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:10,824
BCP, Breath Control Play.

563
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:14,060
Couples increase their partner's
pleasure through strangulation.

564
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,707
And if you're not careful,
it leaves marks.

565
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:18,213
Yeah, this guy Julian Harper's an actor,

566
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,560
so I'm sure he didn't want bruises
on his neck to be showing on camera.

567
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,481
There were only two girls in the suite.

568
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:25,264
Which one of them killed him ?

569
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,174
Burnt pantyhose.

570
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,546
Okay, evidence of sex games gone wrong.

571
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:33,344
I don't see how we could have missed anything.

572
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,272
There's no fireplace here.

573
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:37,621
I haven't seen any lighters.

574
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:40,651
Well, something singed the hose.

575
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,280
There's some burnt residue on this lamp.

576
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,209
You know what I think ?

577
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:17,556
I think someone tied him up, and they couldn't
get the knot undone, because it melted.

578
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:19,155
So they panicked.

579
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:21,508
And they pulled the hose down.

580
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:24,235
I'll print the light.

581
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,991
I guess even having an unlimited supply
of hot women is not enough ?

582
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:32,850
Bondage sex with your best friend ?

583
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,526
It's cool, you guys were on the down low*.

584
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:35,527
* African-American slang.
Down low implies men that sleep with other men
but lead a straight or non-gay social life.

585
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,818
I don't understand.

586
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:43,378
Well, we found both your prints and Julian's
prints on a light fixture above the bed.

587
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:46,695
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We were not down like that.

588
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:50,234
Rise and shine, buddy !
Room service.

589
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,107
Dude, Julian ?

590
00:40:02,973 --> 00:40:07,334
He did it to himself.
He did it to himself.

591
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,082
So I took the pantyhose,
and I took them off the light.

592
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:14,182
And then I put his boxers back on.

593
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:20,994
I wasn't going to let his mom open up
Us magazine and see her boy like that.

594
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,450
Jules, he always did me right.

595
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:29,803
Now I just wanted to do him the same.

596
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,976
I got the serial number run down
from Keo's shotgun.

597
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:39,205
He bought it last week,
two days before he shot Samay.

598
00:40:39,205 --> 00:40:43,976
The guy's barely scraping by, and he
spends $250 on a brand-new Mossberg ?

599
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:47,354
There's a word for that.
"Premeditation."

600
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,619
Your brother gets killed.

601
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,346
You killed the guy who did it
with a shotgun you just bought.

602
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:54,210
And end up $5,000 ahead.

603
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,681
In Nevada, that's murder one.

604
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,169
20 years to life.

605
00:41:04,169 --> 00:41:06,849
Unless you get the death sentence.

606
00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:12,955
- What are my client's options ?
- A full confession.

607
00:41:12,955 --> 00:41:16,446
We make a recommendation to the DA,
maybe he gets murder two.

608
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,390
I brought Noy here to help me.

609
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,652
What ?

610
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,776
To work hard and save.

611
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:31,590
To bring our family here.

612
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,556
Our parent.

613
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:35,980
Our sister.

614
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,018
My wife.

615
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:40,795
Instead he waste the money.

616
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:47,323
On the DVD, gambling, clothes.

617
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:52,848
Noy's life was worthless.

618
00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:57,736
His death is not.

619
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:09,329
Griss, we closed that actor case.

620
00:42:10,168 --> 00:42:10,964
And ?

621
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:15,022
Accidental death as a result
of auto-erotic asphyxiation.

622
00:42:15,022 --> 00:42:18,270
Strangled himself to death
to enhance his own pleasure.

623
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,811
It was in the days of public hangings

624
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:24,476
that people first noticed
that men would get erections

625
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,680
and sometimes even ejaculate.

626
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,513
They called it "the killer orgasm."

627
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,368
It's a waste.

628
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:35,157
Guy had everything... money, fame...

629
00:42:35,157 --> 00:42:38,793
Yeah, look where he ended up.

630
00:42:38,794 --> 00:42:42,722
<i> All around me are familiar faces</i>

631
00:42:42,722 --> 00:42:49,097
<i>Worn out places, worn out faces</i>

632
00:42:49,097 --> 00:42:53,723
<i>Bright and early for their daily races</i>

633
00:42:53,724 --> 00:43:00,128
<i>Going nowhere, going nowhere</i>

634
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:03,861
<i>Mad world</i>

635
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,546
