 BOB DYLAN: Rainy Day Women

4
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:14,748
 Well, they'll stone you
when you're trying to be so good

5
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:19,497
 They'll stone you
just like they said they would

6
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:24,342
 They'll stone you
when you're tryin' to go home

7
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:29,219
 Then they'll stone you
when you're there all alone

8
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:34,289
 But I would not feel so all alone

9
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:39,167
 Everybody must get stoned

10
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:43,882
 Well, they'll stone you
when you're walkin' on the street

11
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:49,114
 They'll stone you
when you're tryin' to keep your seat

12
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:52,795
 They'll stone you
when you're walkin' on the floor

13
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:58,513
 They'll stone you
when you're walkin' to the door

14
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,514
 But I would not feel so all alone

15
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:08,348
 Everybody must get stoned

16
00:02:09,111 --> 00:02:13,340
 Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end

17
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:18,258
 Then they'll stone you
and then they'll come back again

18
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,095
 They'll stone you
when you're riding in your car

19
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:28,097
 They'll stone you
when you're playing your guitar

20
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,530
 Yes, but I would not feel so all alone

21
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:37,644
 Everybody must get stoned

22
00:03:09,548 --> 00:03:12,663
 Oh, say, can you see

23
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:16,613
 By the dawn's early light

24
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:20,569
 What so proudly we hailed

25
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,974
 At the twilight's last gleaming

26
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:26,007
(Star-Spangled Banner solo)

27
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:32,408
Our forces are ready.

28
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:38,163
I know they will acquit themselves
as they always have.

29
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:45,272
There has never been a finer fighting force
than you are going to join.

30
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:47,712
I have a dream today.

31
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:57,068
Let's get a joint. Let's get ripped.

32
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:59,672
Let's proudly gather around the flag.

33
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:02,501
<i>Did we administer another dose?</i>

34
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,018
<i>He's already got more LSD running through him
than any man in history.</i>

35
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,137
"Hippy" means someone who's hip,
who's turned on.

36
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,140
Great to be here.

37
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:13,140
- All right, let's bleed it in.
- Here we go.

38
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:25,284
<i>The brainwaves are going right off the scope.</i>

39
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,324
<i>Cut the film.</i>

40
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,239
And lights up. Take off his headphones.

41
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:35,435
<i>Son, how do you feel?</i>

42
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,993
We can't expect a verbal response.

43
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,230
Did you like the movie, son?

44
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,632
Let's get right to it. Son, listen closely, son.

45
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:53,105
Would you go to war?

46
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:56,030
Would you fight for your country?

47
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,465
That's a positive response.

48
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:05,418
You see, Sid. The increased dosage
makes all the difference in the world.

49
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:08,102
It's like night and day.

50
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:09,700
(Scientists laugh)

51
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,810
<i>Of course, you know what the implications are.</i>

52
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,736
A little more testing,
and the defence departments go-ahead,

53
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:19,485
we'll turn these anti-Vietnam protestors
into loyal soldiers in no time.

54
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,285
We can win this war.

55
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,319
(Groans)

56
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,317
Ah.

57
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:34,435
I've got to split now, man.

58
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:46,107
Hey, thanks for the acid.

59
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,337
Peace.

60
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:00,137
Peace! (Echoes)

61
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,536
 When the truth is found

62
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:09,494
 To be lies

63
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:12,777
 And all the joy

64
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:16,568
 Within you dies

65
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:19,967
 Don't you want somebody to love?

66
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:23,126
 Don't you need somebody to love?

67
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:26,716
 Wouldn't you love somebody to love?

68
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:31,201
 You better find somebody to love...

69
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:33,593
Hey, man.

70
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:37,948
<i>Excuse me. What is this shit?</i>

71
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,474
I didn't write this.

72
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:45,426
What happened to "Raise your bloody fist
and smash the cancerous sore

73
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:48,269
of the imperialist system", man?

74
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:52,426
Sammy, we're gonna bust some heavy walls
with this. Dig this concept.

75
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:55,981
We're gonna ask everybody in the world,
next May Day, at one o'clock,

76
00:06:56,026 --> 00:07:00,301
to stop what they're doing, drop their bullshit,
and take a breath together.

77
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,332
A pause, man. A world pause.

78
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,175
<i>- Here we go.
- Come on. Listen to me.</i>

79
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:11,130
Oneness breaks down man's uptight concepts
of money, personal property,

80
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:14,245
uniforms, shirts and ties,
reserved parking spaces.

81
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:15,963
It blows it all to hell.

82
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,569
How many copies do you want for the rally
this afternoon?

83
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:19,837
5,000. Sammy?

84
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:21,878
<i>- Shotgun.
- Shotgun.</i>

85
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:30,598
1984 is gonna be outstanding, man.

86
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:34,313
No materialism, no wars, enlightened leaders.
Good smoke, man.

87
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:36,313
It's gonna be beautiful.

88
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:43,031
 You better find somebody to love

89
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,647
Wow. Petra, what it is?

90
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,205
It's photo-pointillism.

91
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,243
That's what I call it.

92
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,851
Hey, that's enormously groovy, man.

93
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,722
I just love the feel of the paint on my hands.

94
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:18,757
This is definitely my thing.

95
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,555
Er, like, what is it a picture of?

96
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:26,355
I don't know.
Like, I dropped the camera and it just went off.

97
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,395
But now it's definitely talking to me.

98
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:33,107
Right. Hey, what's it shouting?

99
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:44,698
Sit. Sit down.

100
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:46,737
Everyone, sit down. Let's go.

101
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:54,452
Do you like to dress like that, son?

102
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,454
It's my job, sir.

103
00:08:57,498 --> 00:08:59,488
<i>Take that hat off.</i>

104
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,366
First man is Fred Wouk.

105
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:06,403
Second man is Hesus Monteya.

106
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,526
They're wanted for draft evasion, inciting riots,

107
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:14,238
possession of illegal substances.

108
00:09:14,286 --> 00:09:16,958
Excuse me, sir. How old are these photographs?

109
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,435
You have something in your teeth.

110
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,548
- What?
- In your teeth. Right there.

111
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:32,990
I followed them from Seattle to Haight Ashbury...

112
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,991
Thank you, sir.

113
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,226
...to the Democratic convention in Chicago
and now here.

114
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:45,537
Intelligence reports that they will be attending
an anti-war demonstration today in New York.

115
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,938
I am aware of the strains upon the youth
of today.

116
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,410
But where are these people taking us?

117
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:02,970
And what's wrong with collecting baseball cards,

118
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:05,649
driving in the country in your Chevy convertible,

119
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,838
falling in love,

120
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:10,844
the Mills Bro... the Mills Brothers?

121
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:18,119
 I'm gonna buy a paper doll
that I can call my own

122
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:21,468
 A doll that other fellas cannot steal

123
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:28,423
 And when those flirty, flirty guys,
with their flirty, flirty eyes

124
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:30,463
(Hums)

125
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:32,149
Do you like that song, son?

126
00:10:32,191 --> 00:10:34,305
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Liar!

127
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:38,543
- Sucklehoney?
- Huh?

128
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:43,099
You know, Leila did my reading yesterday.

129
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,257
Yeah.

130
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,814
She said we'd be together a long time from now.

131
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,289
- She said that?
- Mm-hm.

132
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,252
The card came up.

133
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,284
- The card came up?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:00,243
You know, the one with the man and the woman
holding hands facing the sun

135
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,280
with little baby children.

136
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,158
Cos she said that she saw children.

137
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,395
And I want to have lots and lots of children.

138
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:14,230
She said with my artwork I could do that.

139
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,517
- She say that?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,548
Mm-hm.

141
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:21,946
I really love you.

142
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:25,064
I love you too, baby.

143
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:33,941
 The first days are the hardest days

144
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,259
(Knocking)

145
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:37,693
 Don't you worry any more

146
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,573
 Cos when life looks like easy street

147
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:44,179
 There is danger at your door

148
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:47,248
 Think this through with me

149
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:48,729
Hello, hello.

150
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,686
- I'm eating rice-a-roni.
- Yes, I see. Ma'am?

151
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:53,643
You want some? I'll fix you a plate.

152
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,682
No. Thank you.

153
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,005
My name is Brubaker. I'm from
the Justice Department, special task force.

154
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:05,313
I have federal warrants
for the arrests of these two individuals.

155
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:07,953
Would you look at these, please?

156
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,430
What are they wanted for?

157
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:16,264
Draft evasion, conspiring to undermine
the government of the United States.

158
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,711
Oh. Since when is it a crime
to speak your mind?

159
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:28,462
Pardon me, you just have something here.

160
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:30,817
Oh.

161
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:32,855
Oh, God.

162
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,812
Oh, what the hell is this?

163
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:39,212
Oh, my God.

164
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,850
Lunch.

165
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:44,846
(Laughs)

166
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:47,203
Who knows what else is in there, right?

167
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:51,806
Well, I guess I'll just take a bath later.

168
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,483
<i>Maybe not later, but...soon.</i>

169
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,757
Listen, I don't know these people,

170
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,594
but, if you need some help,
my door is always open.

171
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:07,030
Ma'am, as a matter of fact,
I would like to come inside.

172
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,669
Get a warrant.

173
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:15,704
That was a federal pig. He's looking for you
and Hesus, and he says he's coming back.

174
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,107
- That's Brubaker.
- Has that pig got radar? He keeps following us.

175
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:22,663
We've got to drop out of sight
unless we want to do serious time.

176
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,381
- Hey, Ronnie, thanks for covering.
- Oh, please. I enjoy it.

177
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:28,574
You got room in your bag for these, man?

178
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,500
Come on, Sammy. Move your ass.

179
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,374
Er, Fred, listen. I'm gonna stay.

180
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,529
- How come?
- We've got to split.

181
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:41,169
I've been looking at all this shit
and I haven't finished anything.

182
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:45,125
Look, the Atomic Raspberry Banana.
I can't write this shit on the run.

183
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:50,806
This is where it's at. I've got to stay here
long enough to finish one of these.

184
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:53,565
- Is that cool?
- Very cool.

185
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,914
Everybody's got to follow their own path.

186
00:13:55,964 --> 00:13:57,954
You stay here and write.

187
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:02,272
I love you, man.

188
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,832
- I'll always be here for you.
- I'm gonna miss you, Sammy.

189
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,868
I'll miss you too, Fred.

190
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:13,111
- Do you know where you're going?
- Oh, hey, no.

191
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,869
I never know where I'm going.

192
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:17,218
Consequently, I don't know when I'll be back.

193
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:19,224
Maybe I'm there already. Who knows.

194
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:22,017
Fred, I've just got to pack these brushes.

195
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:25,136
Er... Petra.

196
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:28,570
Here, honey, put this down, just a minute.

197
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:30,611
What?

198
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,410
OK, listen.

199
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,368
Remember when I said that you needed
some time to yourself

200
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,406
because you'd never been on your own?

201
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,084
- You want to break up?
- No.

202
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:42,842
I just can't do this with you.

203
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:46,164
I'm coming back
so please be cool and understand.

204
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:49,964
OK, let's split.

205
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:54,155
It's OK, you know,
because I've decided to, like, drop out

206
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:57,397
and devote all my time to getting into my work.

207
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,236
- Come on.
- I'm at a real critical point right now.

208
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:03,586
I got this great idea, like, how art is everything.

209
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,626
- Come on.
- The window of insanity,

210
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:08,028
the documenter of madness,

211
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,188
the collective aesthetic kept safe from the war...

212
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,226
- Mister, your cab is here.
- I'll be here till you get back.

213
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:17,780
OK. I love you.

214
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:21,020
Oh, no, wait! Wait, I've got to get a picture.

215
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:23,053
Yeah. That's great, Ronnie.

216
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,476
(Cock crows)

217
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:01,705
(Bird calls)

218
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:50,310
Hey, can I get a hit off that, man?

219
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:53,433
What?

220
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,467
Let me get a hit off that joint.

221
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:58,385
<i>- Huh?
- Yes.</i>

222
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,982
Yeah, sure, man.

223
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,049
Wow, it fish-lipped it.

224
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:23,452
<i>- Are you hallucinating?
- Huh?</i>

225
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:27,805
Man, those research assholes
sure fucked you up.

226
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,246
What makes you think that, man?

227
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,280
(Both laugh)

228
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:37,357
(Coughs)

229
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,399
Hey, man, this should loosen your scales, man.

230
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,988
Have another hit, brother.

231
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:55,863
<i>Hey, suck on it, fish.</i>

232
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:59,261
Ooh, good.

233
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:02,864
- Hesus?
- Huh?

234
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,658
Let's go get some lunch.

235
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,534
Ah. Yeah.

236
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:13,374
Oh, yeah.

237
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,216
Sure, man.

238
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:18,247
Anything but fish.

239
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,963
Hey, Fred. Hey! Fred!

240
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,441
Hey, Hesus.

241
00:18:29,488 --> 00:18:32,876
Fred, we gotta talk.
I just came back from over the mountain.

242
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,719
- I ran into these tourists.
- Tourists?

243
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:37,481
Just listen to me here, man.

244
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:39,830
They want to make a trade
for some of our grass.

245
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:42,598
They've got chocolate, a radio, new jeans.

246
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:45,834
You know the commune rules -
no contact with the outside.

247
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:48,070
Then we've got to change the rules, man!

248
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,993
I've been in this jungle for 20 years, all right.

249
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:53,226
Everything I own has holes in it.

250
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:57,739
I have not had a candy bar since 191.

251
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:03,616
Yeah, well, anyway,
I want a new pair of jeans, man. I really do.

252
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:06,222
OK, cool it out. We'll put it to a vote.

253
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:08,649
Maybe other people feel the same way you do.

254
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,088
I know I could use a new pair of jeans myself.

255
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:14,604
But then, that's where it starts.

256
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:17,848
It starts with a new pair of blue jeans.

257
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:19,610
That's where what starts?

258
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:22,722
Well, pretty soon you'll be trading on
a regular basis -

259
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,601
boots, cigarettes, instant coffee.

260
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:30,604
Those pens that when you turn them
upside down, the bathing suit goes off the girl.

261
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:31,838
Yeah, right.

262
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:35,920
But one day you'll wake up
and you'll look around and you'll say:

263
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,518
I want more.

264
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,992
I want the house with the two-car garage.

265
00:19:41,037 --> 00:19:43,230
I've got to have the pool with the sauna,

266
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:46,265
and no home is complete
without the automatic gates.

267
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:49,389
Automatic gates are cool.

268
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:51,421
But then you'll have to expand.

269
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,698
So, you'll cut down a few trees.

270
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:56,582
I wouldn't trim our trees. They're cool.

271
00:19:56,626 --> 00:20:00,457
Just a few trees, and put yourself up
a shopping centre, right over there.

272
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,254
Because now you're monopolising.

273
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:05,019
You'll hire lawyers, accountants, assistants.

274
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,016
You're taking a big bite out of life,
but you're still hungry.

275
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,523
Wait! There's a delicatessen.

276
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:14,087
But you're on a highway stuck in a traffic jam.

277
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:18,601
You've got no time to eat any more.
"My God, I'm late for a three o'clock meeting!"

278
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,560
You'll honk your horn and scream,

279
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:24,121
"Get out of my way, you son of a bitch,
before I kill you with my car!"

280
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,679
Suddenly your arm gets all tense
and your chest starts to hurt,

281
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,713
and you can't breathe, you're suffocating,

282
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,069
and, my God, the pain in your arm. The pain!

283
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,949
And why?

284
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:39,264
Because you wanted a new pair of blue jeans.

285
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:42,304
Wow.

286
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:45,106
Yeah, you're right. Fuck it. Fuck it.

287
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:47,663
What can I say? It's true.

288
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,699
Wait a minute. Hey, wait a minute.

289
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:53,935
Why are you giving up so easily?
You want something, right?

290
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:56,854
Yeah.

291
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:59,415
- But you just said...
- So what? I'm just one guy.

292
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:02,576
Fight for it. Petition it.
You should get together a list of names.

293
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:05,290
Fred, man, where am I gonna get a list?

294
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:07,451
(Explosion)
- What the fuck was that?

295
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:11,569
 CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL:
Run Through The Jungle

296
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,044
 Thought it was a nightmare

297
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:18,678
(Gunfire)

298
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:23,323
 They told me: Don't go walkin' slow

299
00:21:24,003 --> 00:21:26,515
 The Devil's on the loose

300
00:21:26,841 --> 00:21:28,831
 Better run through the jungle

301
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:32,188
 Better run through the jungle

302
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,785
I'm in trouble here.

303
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,630
<i>What is the status of the papers?</i>

304
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,627
I've got the papers but I need help.

305
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:47,055
<i>The papers must not fall into the wrong hands.
This is imperative. Do you copy?</i>

306
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,096
<i>- Do you copy?
- Copy.</i>

307
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,342
 Satan cries: Take aim!

308
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:55,851
 Better run through the jungle

309
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:59,129
 Better run through the jungle...

310
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:04,205
(Grunting)

311
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,847
- It's coming from down there.
- Who the fuck could it be?

312
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,242
(Explosion)
- Shit!

313
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:14,244
Are you American?

314
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:16,277
<i>Please.</i>

315
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:22,398
- Oh, man.
- Please.

316
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,396
Sit still. We'll take care of you.

317
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,429
No. Take this. Destroy.

318
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,990
Don't let them use it...

319
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:29,947
They'll use it against you.

320
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,745
- Who?
- Do it for your country.

321
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,709
Is he dead, man?

322
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:41,738
He's very dead.

323
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:44,697
(Explosion)

324
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:47,974
Come on, man, let's split.

325
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:52,291
(Helicopter overhead)

326
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:58,007
So, what's the plan, man?

327
00:22:59,735 --> 00:23:02,008
Me and Hesus are going back to the States.

328
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:04,042
- Huh?
- What? Why?

329
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:07,607
Because the United States
is going to invade here.

330
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:11,400
They want to get rid of the Communists
and set up their own puppet regime.

331
00:23:11,446 --> 00:23:13,878
- When's this supposed to happen?
- By spring.

332
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:16,994
And this is the evidence.
We've got it here in our hands.

333
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,032
This is Vietnam all over again.

334
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,470
<i>Imperative to find out who they are.
Do you copy?</i>

335
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:25,227
They look like hippies.

336
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:30,187
See? It's karma.

337
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,857
Maybe this time we can break it to the press
before it ever gets going.

338
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:39,136
Hesus, we're going back to New York, man.

339
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:43,214
Ah.

340
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:45,253
Pastrami.

341
00:24:20,996 --> 00:24:24,111
Wow. Lots of new buildings, man.

342
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:27,303
Hey, that's the same.

343
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:30,221
My mother took me there one time.

344
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,940
And left me.

345
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:33,978
Hey, we're home, my man.

346
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:38,135
- Let's go eat.
- Yeah, eat.

347
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,291
Cool.

348
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:41,979
Let's get some pizza, man.

349
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:44,329
Two suspects heading south on 6th Avenue.

350
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:51,653
 I like marijuana

351
00:24:51,694 --> 00:24:53,172
 You like marijuana

352
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:55,679
 We like marijuana too

353
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:58,926
 I want to be a hippy and I want to get stoned

354
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:01,401
 On mari, marijuana

355
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:07,761
 I want to be a runaway,
got to leave home for mari, marijuana

356
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:11,796
 Remember the teenybops
sniffing airplane glue?

357
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,109
 Mari, marijuana

358
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:20,546
 He used to freak out in Central Park too
for mari, marijuana

359
00:25:21,473 --> 00:25:24,940
 I want to get high but I never knew why

360
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,264
 Here comes the car
but I've got to say goodbye

361
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:29,298
 For mari, marijuana

362
00:25:31,346 --> 00:25:33,335
Urgh. What is that?

363
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:36,373
 Mari, marijuana

364
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:40,131
This is a nightmare.

365
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,809
<i>- Hey, Ronnie.
- Ronnie.</i>

366
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:44,847
<i>Looking good.</i>

367
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,325
Oh, my God!

368
00:25:47,974 --> 00:25:49,964
Oh, God!

369
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:00,915
So, who are all these people up there?

370
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:03,715
Who are those people?

371
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:05,275
I don't know.

372
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:08,914
When I opened up this place, I had no idea.

373
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,232
I just figured it'd be nice to have a space

374
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:14,665
where the old gang could get together and talk
once in a while.

375
00:26:14,715 --> 00:26:17,147
People came, I made food.

376
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:19,421
More people came, I made more food.

377
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:23,583
And then, one night, Mick Jagger shows up.

378
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:25,899
<i>- It was all over.
- Whoa.</i>

379
00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:29,141
They came, and they came in droves.

380
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:30,935
It was like some horror movie.

381
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:32,495
I couldn't keep them out.

382
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:36,214
I kept changing the menu,
I charged outrageous prices.

383
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:39,135
It didn't matter. They kept coming.

384
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:42,486
Who are all those people up there?

385
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:47,043
Maybe it's better not to know.

386
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,797
You want to hang out here? Lt'll be my pleasure.

387
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:53,838
Thanks, Ronnie.

388
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,963
Far out!

389
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:57,835
Oh, Ronnie, my jacket.

390
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:59,873
Goddamn it.

391
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,597
That's wonderful.

392
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,153
Hesus, check this out. Oh, Ronnie, thank you.

393
00:27:05,718 --> 00:27:07,708
Thank you. Wow.

394
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:09,348
Wow.

395
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,871
Wow.

396
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:13,903
Hesus, look at us, man.

397
00:27:13,952 --> 00:27:15,942
<i>That was the day we left.</i>

398
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,531
Hey, Ronnie...

399
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,570
have you got any scissors?

400
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:35,448

402
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,806

406
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:57,078
<i>He liked your mother.</i>

407
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:59,509
<i>I am indulgent. But that's me.</i>

408
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,310
<i>He liked your mother a lot.</i>

409
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:02,870
<i>I want your hair.</i>

410

<i>I'm not the one in love. Or am I?</i>

411

<i>I live for this moment here.</i>

<i>(Operatic singing)</i>

<i>La Fleck, by Princess Petra.</i>

414
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:25,575
Hello, Dr Heimer. It's Petra.

415
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,009
I just saw one of my new commercials
and I'm having that feeling again.

416
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:35,366
Nothing. I'm feeling... nothing.

417
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,403
Excuse me. They have to leave.

418
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:39,203
Are you ready for them yet?

419
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,239
OK.

420
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,279
Could you hold for just a second?

421
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,038
Did you watch it? What did you think?

422
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:55,108
I think our girl did a fabulous job.
My people at the agency are flipping out.

423
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,149
We're just fantastic...

424
00:28:58,597 --> 00:29:00,587
What happened to the bell?

425
00:29:00,636 --> 00:29:04,592
I wanted a bell sound
when the girl changed from white to La Fleck.

426
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:06,622
What happened?

427
00:29:06,671 --> 00:29:12,106
You see, with this commercial
I was going for an artistic thing.

428
00:29:12,148 --> 00:29:15,854
<i>A world where there are no bells,</i>

429
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:19,736
where bells are an intrusion to the visual... thing.

430
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:24,694
A world where a person can be wearing white
and then... zim, zim, zim...

431
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,170
they're wearing art

432
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:27,729
and there are no bells.

433
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,605
I have a theory, Eema.

434
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,488
A theory about bells.

435
00:29:33,532 --> 00:29:37,807
We had an outrageously expensive survey
done, which showed, if used correctly,

436
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:42,124
a bell sound could subliminally seduce
consumers into buying our product.

437
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:45,758
Which, in case nobody told you, is not art.

438
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:50,352
They're fucking rags with blotches on them!

439
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,390
So fuck art, Eema, and put the bells back in!

440
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,866
But of course.

441
00:29:57,315 --> 00:29:59,270
I knew there was something missing.

442
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:02,428
Now that you mention it, it was the bells.
Dingaling-aling.

443
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:04,426
<i>We'll have lots of bells, won't we?</i>

444
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,584
Who makes commercials without bells?

445
00:30:13,703 --> 00:30:15,693
Sorry, Dr Heimer, where was I?

446
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:19,659
Yes, um... life's spotty.

447
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:22,530
I can't seem to get anything solid going.

448
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,770
I know I do.

449
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:31,680
But I've been looking inside of myself for so long
that it hurts to think of anybody else.

450
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,756
(Phone rings)

451
00:30:43,002 --> 00:30:44,992
Bring it up.

Where's the lobster? Dig it.

- It's Fred and Hesus.

463
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:26,607

Barbecue sauce, wow. Dig it.

473
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,789
Mm. Taste it.

474

What are you doing here?

479
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:08,891
We just got into town
so we thought we'd look you up.

00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:12,135
I'm sitting here in absolute shock. I mean, you...

481
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:14,566
You still look like dirty, filthy hippies.

482
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,606
- It's great.
- You look great too. Doesn't she?

483
00:32:18,654 --> 00:32:21,927
Could you try and eat over the box?
It's the help's night off.

484
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:24,245
Hoo-hoo-hoo! Help's night off!

485
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:29,518
- Could you pass the caviar, please?
- But of course.

486
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:32,712
What's this?

487
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:34,559
<i>- No.
- Whoa!</i>

488
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,311
(Stereo on)

489
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,430
Guys, it was really great seeing you,
but I'm not feeling that well, so...

490
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:45,194
I thought so. What's wrong, baby?

491
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:47,428
It's just been... It's just not worth going into.

492
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:49,588
<i>Why don't you just give me your number?</i>

493
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:55,898
Come on, babe, I'm here. Talk to me.

494
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:57,857
I don't want to bother you with my problems.

495
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:00,372
Babe, it's me - Fred. You can tell me anything.

496
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:04,172
Listen, I know. I don't want to talk to anybody.

497
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:08,257
So, why don't you just leave
and we'll get together real soon?

498
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:13,244
You know, I am picking up these
"Please stay, Fred, I need to talk to you" vibes.

499
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:22,201
All right. I need for you to leave now.

500
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:23,839
- I'm sorry.
- Uh-huh. No.

501
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:27,722
- Get out!
- I'm here, babe. I'm right here. Talk to me.

502
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:31,879
What the hell's wrong with you? Get the fuck out.

503
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:33,876
I think you need a hug.

504
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,990
I don't even know you.
Get the fuck away from my stereo!

505
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:39,231
Babe, let me hug you. Let me hug you.

506
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:43,664
You take one more step
and I'll motherfucking kill you!

507
00:33:43,713 --> 00:33:45,702
OK. Peace.

508
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:53,864
Like, I'm sorry. I sense you have
a great deal of fear, and you're hurting.

509
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:57,501
We used to be so close.
I thought you could use a hug.

510
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:00,014
I'm wrong.

511
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:02,527
I'm sorry.

512
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:05,249
(Music starts up)

513
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:10,203
Wooh!

514
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:13,164
Hey! Come on! Boogaloo! Dingaling!

515
00:34:13,212 --> 00:34:15,201
Shake it, baby!

516
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:20,324
Wooh!

517
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:21,640
Come on, Petra, loosen up!

518
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:28,235
 Keep your eyes on the road
and your hands upon the wheel

519
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,629
<i> Upon the wheel...</i>

520
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:37,785
(Thunder rumbles)

521
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,888
Sir?

522
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:11,998
Still working on your autobiography, sir?

523
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:21,513
Tears of shame ran down the cheeks
of the fat ten-year-old.

524
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:26,148
"Bend over," my father commanded,
"and bare your buttocks to me."

525
00:35:34,513 --> 00:35:36,980
This was taken on 6th Avenue and 51 st Street.

526
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:44,617
My God.

527
00:35:47,464 --> 00:35:49,771
- I know these men.
- Are they terrorists?

528
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:53,371
They're much worse.

529
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,808
They're idealists.

530
00:35:57,497 --> 00:36:03,329
 And I can't believe I'm coming home

531
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:08,840
 There's a mission overdue

532
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:14,235
 After years apart

533
00:36:15,324 --> 00:36:17,314
 Me and my heart...

534
00:36:17,363 --> 00:36:19,352
I'm so stoned.

535
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,591
How about some frugen glas?

536
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,913
Frugen haagen... Haagen frugen...

537
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,515
I'm so hungry.

538
00:36:25,557 --> 00:36:27,546
Hey.

539
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:33,102
How you doing?

540
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:35,900
I'm really into coloured chicks.

541
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:43,179
<i>You must have gone crazy down there
with no TV, no music, no newspapers.</i>

542
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:45,134

There's a picture of Sammy.

557
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:17,867
I haven't seen Sammy in a long time.

558
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:21,225
We hung out after you left.

559
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:24,462
- He's married now.
- Really?

560
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:29,745
Oh, God.

561
00:38:29,788 --> 00:38:31,663
- See that guy?
- Mm-hm.

562
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:33,935
- That's Emil.
- Emil.

563
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:36,656
He's a nutritionist and crystal healer.

564
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:42,048
He reaffirmed my sexuality
by increasing my bran intake.

565
00:38:44,497 --> 00:38:46,407
We were very much in love.

566
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:49,006
Yeah.

567
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:53,002
Petra?

568
00:38:56,688 --> 00:38:58,678
You need to get happy.

569
00:38:59,726 --> 00:39:01,716
Let's go boogie.

Hi. Fred Wouk. How are you?
Good to meet you.

00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:41,048

So, Fred, what do you do?

580
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,357
I draw things. I meditate, I build huts.

581
00:39:53,408 --> 00:39:56,125
- I'm really good with my hands.
- That's great.

582
00:39:56,166 --> 00:40:00,917
Actually, I'm in New York right now
because I'm trying to stop a war.

583
00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:03,599
- (Laughs)
- Petra, how are you? Where've you been?

584
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:08,348
So, what do you do, man?

585
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:11,308
- You drinking?
- Sure.

586
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:14,072
- Two gin and tonics.
- Gin and tonic, yeah.

587
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:18,341
I don't know what you'd call me.

588
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:23,059
People give me their money to invest in stock,
but I don't do that.

589
00:40:23,746 --> 00:40:25,383
What do you do with their money?

590
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,414
I take it and I buy art.

591
00:40:27,463 --> 00:40:29,453
I bought a house.

592
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:31,809
Really hot car.

593
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,248
Sometimes, Fred, I just give the shit away.

594
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:37,207
That's really beautiful, man.

595
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:39,246
Oh, yeah? I think so too.

596
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:44,600
- Hey, good luck with your war.
- Thank you very much. Yeah.

597
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:53,636

606
00:41:32,177 --> 00:41:34,166
- Hiya, Mona.
- Hi.

607
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:38,523
Wanda, what's happening, babe?

608
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:42,605
Mm, bless your heart.

609
00:41:42,649 --> 00:41:44,127
Ow! Damn!

610
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,158
 Luxury - give it me!

Nice lighter, man.

613
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:58,068
So I hear you live in a jungle. What do you do?

614
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,912
I grow things, I build huts.

615
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:02,946
You're an architect?

616
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,464
So, what do you do, man?

617
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:07,582
<i>- I'm a writer.
- Really?</i>

618
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:11,258
That's great, cos I've got this story
that maybe you can help me with.

619
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:13,821
Yeah, er... Amos, hi.

620
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:16,296
- How are you?
- When did you get here?

621
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:18,937
- What are you up to?
- I'm completely bored tonight.

622
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:22,291
- It's a terrible scene.
- No-one's interesting any more.

623
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:26,650
Petra, I know this guy Jay is a friend of yours,
but, like, he's really rude.

624
00:42:27,817 --> 00:42:29,807
Jay's a bit of a genius.

625
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:31,970
Don't say anything or he'll eat you alive.

626
00:42:32,014 --> 00:42:34,970
<i>- I think the scene is over.
- Maybe we could go someplace else.</i>

627
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,604
Excuse me, but I have to tell you this.

628
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,116
We were talking, and this guy walks in and...

629
00:42:40,168 --> 00:42:42,475
What are you looking at him for? Look at me.

630
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,755
I have no idea what's going on here.

631
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:46,522
I'm sorry. OK?

632
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,553
(Laughs)

633
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:51,600
- No, it's not OK. Look...
- Hey, don't touch me.

634
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,550
Ooh, you're really uptight, aren't you?

635
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,395
- Look...
- Get your hands off me, OK?

636
00:42:57,516 --> 00:43:01,108
No, it's not OK.
I am violating your space on purpose.

637
00:43:01,153 --> 00:43:03,143
OK? OK?

638
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:05,260
Touching is a part of communication.

639
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,220
If you ask me,
you could use a little communication.

640
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:11,497
You've probably had this problem all your life.
We can work it out.

641
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:14,460
What's his friend like?

642
00:43:21,898 --> 00:43:23,888
Oh, wow. Haven't had these in...

643
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:27,925
Wow, never had these.

644
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:34,840
Wonder what they are.

645
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:38,880
Ah...

646
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,950
(Sobbing)

647
00:43:51,157 --> 00:43:54,943
FRED: Oh, man.
You've got to go easy on yourself.

648
00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:57,461
(Sobs) I know. I know.

649
00:43:58,632 --> 00:44:01,827
He was my uncle.
He said it was just gonna be a fishing trip.

650
00:44:24,893 --> 00:44:26,883
I had a really nice time tonight.

651
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:28,921
Me too, babe.

652
00:44:36,365 --> 00:44:38,116
I guess I'd better go to bed.

653
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:40,153
Yeah, it's late.

654
00:44:53,632 --> 00:44:55,622
- Good night.
- Good night.

655
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,577
Night.

656
00:45:32,485 --> 00:45:34,474
Ah... listen...

657
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:42,388
I think you're really beautiful.

658
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:45,151
I'm not sure, but I think I was getting these

659
00:45:45,195 --> 00:45:48,310
"Please don't sleep on the floor,
come share my bed" vibes.

660
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:52,903
I don't know. Maybe it's cos I spent
20 years in the jungle

661
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,735
getting it on with anything I could attract
with a piece of fruit, but...

662
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,777
you really turn me on.

663
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:00,815
You always did.

664
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:15,085
20 years in the jungle?

665
00:46:15,933 --> 00:46:20,401
A safe... single... man.

666
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:36,475
The couple from the co-op board
are supposed to be here at three,

667
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:40,429
but Deedee says they're always early
so I think we should be ready by two.

668
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:42,988
She says they're lovely people.

669
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,148
<i>Lloyd and April Stool.</i>

670
00:46:45,192 --> 00:46:46,544
<i>- Sammy?
- Mm-hm.</i>

671
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,705
Can we try and be positive about this?

672
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,974
Well... we're broke, June.
We're completely broke.

673
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:04,216
That's impossible.
You make over $300,000 a year.

674
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:06,896
I know, but we cannot make it.

675
00:47:12,893 --> 00:47:15,200
Well, you know, we eat out much too much.

676
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:19,479
Now, I would be willing to cook
on a regular basis.

677
00:47:19,528 --> 00:47:21,358
That's a huge saving, Sammy.

678
00:47:21,406 --> 00:47:24,396
What the hell are you talking about?
Are you crazy?

679
00:47:26,923 --> 00:47:31,834
June, we are talking about real money here,
darling. After-tax dollars.

680
00:47:31,879 --> 00:47:33,357
What are you saying, Sammy?

681
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:38,149
That it's a fait accompli, that we should
just roll over on our backs and die?

682
00:47:38,194 --> 00:47:40,990
I mean, look around you, Sammy.
Look at this place.

683
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:45,147
We need more space. We need more closets.
We need... We need...

684
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:48,944
- We need more!
- Yes, June, we do.

685
00:47:49,626 --> 00:47:53,457
You're right. So why don't we just sit down
and figure it out?

686
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:55,652
- We can figure it out, honey.
- I know.

687
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,367
You know, I was thinking.

688
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:06,804
We don't have to fly to see your parents
for Hanukkah.

689
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:09,730
We'll just tell them things are very tight right now
and we can't.

690
00:48:09,772 --> 00:48:12,204
- They'll understand.
- I can't do that, June.

691
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,046
Please, I can't.
There are other things on this list.

692
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:18,476
<i>- There's your thigh reduction appointments.
- No.</i>

693
00:48:18,526 --> 00:48:21,197
<i>- How about we sell the boat?
- I need the boat.</i>

694
00:48:21,244 --> 00:48:22,914
(Phone rings)

695
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,110
Hello?

696
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:26,752
Yeah, this is him.

697
00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:29,748
Oh, what can I do for you?

698
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:32,907
Huh?

699
00:48:34,394 --> 00:48:36,826
Er... well...

700
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:40,025
That was a really long time ago.

701
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:45,134
If the FBI wants any information on me,
they can just call my lawyer.

702
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:48,535
Yeah?

703
00:48:48,584 --> 00:48:50,574
Well, can I get your name?

704
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:52,737
No, I just want... I want your name, OK?

705
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,978
Fred Wouk.

706
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,929
How do you spell that?

707
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:58,968
No, the "Wouk" part.

708
00:49:01,095 --> 00:49:03,085
Fred Wouk.

709
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:06,482
Fred?

710
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,639
Fred, oh, man.

711
00:49:11,168 --> 00:49:14,714
I'm sorry, man, I... It's just been, you know...

712
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:17,561
I don't know. It's been a really long time.

713
00:49:17,603 --> 00:49:21,639
But you got a kid, man? That's outta sight.
Let me get your address.

714
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,349
Yeah, sure, I got it.

715
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:27,706
You can reach me at Petra's. Yeah.
All right, give me that again.

716
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,154
Uh-huh.

717
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:31,184
Mm-hm. Got it.

718
00:49:32,113 --> 00:49:36,103
Oh, I'll be hanging out here
at least another couple of weeks. Yeah. Right.

719
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,582
Groovy. I can't wait to see you, Sammy.

720
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,984
OK, later, man.

721
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,856
How long did you say you were staying for?

722
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,095
As long as you want, baby.

723
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,443
There.

724
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,168
Mm.

725
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:14,034
(Whirring)

726
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:23,552
<i>- Yeah?
MAN: Somebody to see Miss Black.</i>

727
00:50:23,596 --> 00:50:26,313
Oh? Yeah. Excellent.

728
00:50:26,354 --> 00:50:28,547
Yeah, come on up.

729
00:50:30,511 --> 00:50:33,307
- Who was that?
- Er... somebody.

730
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:34,417
(Doorbell)

731
00:50:41,983 --> 00:50:43,381
Yes?

732
00:50:43,422 --> 00:50:45,058
<i>- Miss Black?
- Yes.</i>

733
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,408
My name is Brubaker.
I'm with the Justice Department.

734
00:50:49,138 --> 00:50:51,172
Have you seen these two men?

735
00:50:53,494 --> 00:50:55,131
What's this about?

736
00:51:02,288 --> 00:51:05,562
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Petra, what's going on?

737
00:51:07,604 --> 00:51:09,673
No, no, it's all right. I got it. Keep looking.

738
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,785
Now, why don't you just be a good little boy
and come down here?

739
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:24,343
That's right. Come on. Come on.

740
00:51:24,392 --> 00:51:25,460
Fred.

741
00:51:26,231 --> 00:51:27,788
<i>- You know...
(Glass smashing)</i>

742
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:32,661
<i>...you could save us all a lot of trouble
if you just told me where those papers are.</i>

743
00:51:34,985 --> 00:51:36,212
No way.

744
00:51:37,743 --> 00:51:41,176
Fred, I think you should give him
whatever it is he wants.

745
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,130
I have nothing to do with this.
They're just house guests.

746
00:51:44,178 --> 00:51:47,407
Please! Do not insult my intelligence, lady.

747
00:51:48,175 --> 00:51:50,483
You two go back 20 years.

748
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:53,171
Hey, where's your partner, anyway? Huh?

749
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:56,041
Blandish?

750
00:51:58,768 --> 00:51:59,756
Blandish?

751
00:52:00,886 --> 00:52:02,284
Blandish...

752
00:52:03,684 --> 00:52:06,276
Blandish, come out. Where are you?

753
00:52:08,281 --> 00:52:11,748
(Stammers) You just tell your friend
to come out now.

754
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,773

You looking for me... hippy?

761
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:22,136
Aarrghh!

762
00:53:22,188 --> 00:53:23,540
Hesus, you OK?

763
00:53:25,585 --> 00:53:28,144
<i>- Yeah, I'm cool.
- Have you got the papers?</i>

764
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:30,461
<i>- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here.</i>

765
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:32,377
<i>- Don't be foolish.
- Come on, Petra.</i>

766
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,569
- What?
- They know who you are. It's not safe.

767
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:37,085
I am not committed to this involvement!

768

769

- Hello, Lloyd. Hello.

771
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:01,830
Please come in, won't you?

772
00:54:01,879 --> 00:54:04,471
Sammy, the Stools are here!

773
00:54:05,157 --> 00:54:07,147
- Hello.
- Hi. Sammy.

774
00:54:07,196 --> 00:54:09,788
- Pleasure to meet you. I'm April.
- Hi, April.

775
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:13,221
- Lloyd Stool.
- Lloyd. Yes, it's very nice to meet you.

776
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:16,227
- What a lovely home you have here.
- Oh, April, thank you.

777
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:20,020
Yes... and... we brought you some butter cookies.

778
00:54:20,066 --> 00:54:23,295
(Gasps) Oh, how very thoughtful of you.

779
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,981
Oh, you're so thoughtful and so on time.

780
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:29,932
- Well, we're thrilled to be here.
- We're delighted you're here. So, drinks?

781
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:36,211
- I'm a Molson's man myself. (Breaks wind)
- Oh, Lloyd.

782
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:41,962
I'll have a little white wine with a splash of soda.
We'll call it a spritzer.

783
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:43,329
OK.

784
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,086
- (Lloyd coughs)
- April, please.

785
00:54:45,128 --> 00:54:47,118
Oh, thank you.

786
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:50,443
Oh.

787
00:55:01,876 --> 00:55:03,627
Well...

788
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,426
spritzers for the ladies.

789
00:55:08,312 --> 00:55:09,630
- April.
- Thank you.

790
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:11,183
- June.
- Thank you, darling.

791
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,503
Ale for the men.

792
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:15,616
May I say something?

793
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:21,891
Ahhh.

794
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:24,730
I think you two are lovely people.

795
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,576
So, to put us all at ease,

796
00:55:26,619 --> 00:55:29,290
I want you to think of us
not as some kind of inquisition,

797
00:55:29,337 --> 00:55:31,132
but more as a welcoming wagon.

798
00:55:31,175 --> 00:55:35,962
As far as I'm concerned,
you two will make wonderful neighbours.

799
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:38,365
(Gasps) April, thank you.

800
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:43,243
- So let's get that bottle out and celebrate.
- (Laughs)

801
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:46,433
Lloyd, what say?

802
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:49,760
Well...

803
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,351
I think there might be some reason...

804
00:55:55,198 --> 00:55:56,676
...for celebration.

805
00:55:57,476 --> 00:55:59,705
A toast. Welcome to the Huxley.

806
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:01,744
- Oh, Lloyd, April!
- That's great.

807
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:02,908
- Oh.
- Honey.

808
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:14,533
Mm.

809
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:18,493
- I wonder who that could be.
- Um...

810
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,531
I'll get it, dear.

811
00:56:23,738 --> 00:56:28,410
- Lloyd, April, do have some hors d'ouevres.
- Thank you, June.

812
00:56:28,454 --> 00:56:31,683
Sammy, hi! Great kissing. Can we come in?

813
00:56:31,732 --> 00:56:34,403
- I can't believe you're here.
- I really need your help.

814
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:37,645
Um... June, April, Lloyd. Um...

815
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:40,246
- These are some friends of mine.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

816
00:56:40,286 --> 00:56:42,115
- Lloyd Stool.
- Hey, blood.

817
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:46,319
- Look, man, the pigs are after us.
- Pigs?

818
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,351
Look, it's a long story, but we really need some...

819
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:50,513
Petra!

820
00:56:50,558 --> 00:56:53,992
I told you we cannot call the police.

821
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,946
- (Petra sobs)
- Hey, Sammy, have you got a beer, man?

822
00:56:56,994 --> 00:56:58,631
- In the fridge.
- Oh, yeah.

823
00:56:58,673 --> 00:56:59,821
<i>- Sammy.
- Huh?</i>

824
00:56:59,872 --> 00:57:01,384
Who are these people?

825
00:57:01,431 --> 00:57:02,658
W...

826
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,858
Sammy, can Petra crash on your couch?
She really needs a lie down.

827
00:57:05,907 --> 00:57:07,658
I don't think so, Sammy.

828
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:11,615
- Have you got an opener, man?
- On the side of the bar.

829
00:57:11,663 --> 00:57:13,220
Oh, yeah.

830
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:16,013
<i>- Groovy. Here it is.
- (Whispers) Stop him.</i>

831
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:19,287
- Petra, I want you to lie down.
- (She gasps)

832
00:57:19,338 --> 00:57:21,372
<i>- Petra, stop it.
- Really good to see you.</i>

833
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:23,974
You too, man. Look at the suit. Whoo!

834
00:57:24,014 --> 00:57:25,332
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

835
00:57:25,373 --> 00:57:27,169
- (Petra screams)
- What's going on?

836
00:57:27,212 --> 00:57:29,565
Hey, man, what have you got?
Cement or something?

837
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:33,442
Sammy, look, we've got
these secret documents, man...

838
00:57:33,488 --> 00:57:36,319
We were in the jungle
and these guys started firing...

839
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:38,161
- Listen...
- There was bleeding...

840
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,591
Stop! Man, stop.
I've got these people out there.

841
00:57:40,642 --> 00:57:42,279
- I'm trying to buy a co-op.
- Co-op?

842
00:57:42,321 --> 00:57:44,470
- Oh.
- These people out there, the Stools...

843
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,190
- Stools?
- Yeah. Lloyd and April.

844
00:57:46,238 --> 00:57:48,307
- (Laughs)
- They're named the Stools?

845
00:57:48,357 --> 00:57:50,425
It's not funny. It's not... (Laughs)

846
00:57:50,475 --> 00:57:53,545
- Sammy.
- It sounds like a movie: Here Come The Stools.

847
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:56,781
<i>- Who are these people?
- Oh, we're the Stools!</i>

848
00:57:56,831 --> 00:57:59,059
- You're going to have to leave.
- Sammy, man.

849
00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:01,701
- I want them out.
- Excuse me. I was talking to Sammy.

850
00:58:01,747 --> 00:58:03,896
- I want them out now!
- Hey, lady, back off!

851
00:58:03,946 --> 00:58:06,333
- OK?
- All right, Fred. All right, June.

852
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:08,577
- Fred, come here. I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

853
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:10,373
- Listen to me.
- You Sammy's old lady?

854
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:13,217
- Come back in a couple of hours.
- We got nowhere to go, man.

855
00:58:13,259 --> 00:58:15,408
We're all really scared. Sammy...

856
00:58:15,457 --> 00:58:17,890
I need to talk to somebody. OK? Huh?

857
00:58:18,775 --> 00:58:20,173
Say yes.

858
00:58:21,493 --> 00:58:24,005
- All right, it's cool.
- If we lose this apartment...

859
00:58:24,051 --> 00:58:26,564
June, relax, would you?
You guys just stay in here.

860
00:58:26,609 --> 00:58:28,360
<i>- Right on.
- I mean it. Stay in here.</i>

861
00:58:28,408 --> 00:58:29,760
BOTH: We're here, man.

862
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:32,081
- (Sobbing)
- What is this person doing on my bed?

863
00:58:32,126 --> 00:58:36,116
I don't want her on my bed.
I'm having a very bad feeling.

864
00:58:41,439 --> 00:58:43,315
I'm very sorry about this.

865
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,995
- They're friends of Sammy's...
- Old, old, old friends.

866
00:58:46,036 --> 00:58:48,867
- I haven't seen them in...
- I've never even met them - ever.

867
00:58:54,629 --> 00:58:57,983
<i>FRED: The guy died right in my arms.
Yeah, he did give me the documents.</i>

868
00:58:58,027 --> 00:59:00,539
<i>- Yeah, I'll hold.
- Christ, I need a Valium.</i>

869
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:05,540
- What's a Valium?
- Oh, God, I'm in hell!

870
00:59:05,582 --> 00:59:07,810
No, I don't have any.

871
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,577
No. Hey, man, I don't have any pictures.

872
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:12,925
No. But, see, I do have the documents.

873
00:59:13,936 --> 00:59:15,084
What?

874
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,363
Yeah, you can call it a bloodbath if you want to.

875
00:59:17,413 --> 00:59:19,925
But, see, I have these documents and that's...

876
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:22,368
No. No, I don't...

877
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:24,968
Yes. No. No, I don't have any pictures.

878
00:59:25,008 --> 00:59:26,678
<i>Excuse me? Excuse me?</i>

879
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:31,001
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you,
you yellowjournalist media pig?</i>

880
00:59:31,043 --> 00:59:33,317
<i>I am not listening to you. (Hangs up)</i>

881
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,667
Maybe somebody would like another drink?

882
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,787
I'll have another, Professor.

883
00:59:40,556 --> 00:59:42,034
Wild Turkey.

884
00:59:42,075 --> 00:59:44,269
Anybody got a Valium?

885
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,507
Petra needs two Valium.

886
00:59:47,312 --> 00:59:50,268
Oh, food. Wow, I'm starving.

887
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:52,185
Oh, I left mine at home.

888
00:59:53,028 --> 00:59:54,823
My name's April.

889
00:59:54,866 --> 00:59:57,537
Ohh. Hey, a real pleasure to know you, April.

890
00:59:58,783 --> 01:00:00,773
Oh.

891
01:00:00,822 --> 01:00:02,890
Hi. Hi. Hi.

892
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,453
I'm only sitting for a minute.

893
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,083
Oh.

894
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:13,645
Eat up.

895
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:17,365
Well, what do you say
we get this party moving, right?

896
01:00:20,248 --> 01:00:21,919
<i> Come on, shake your body, baby,
do the conga</i>

897
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:24,035
<i> Know you can't control yourself any longer</i>

898
01:00:24,085 --> 01:00:25,995
<i> Come on, shake your body, baby,
do the conga</i>

899
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:28,510
<i> Know you can't control yourself any longer...</i>

900
01:00:28,562 --> 01:00:30,199
Hey, Mrs Stool, let's dance.

901
01:00:30,241 --> 01:00:33,436
- Oh, well, I never thought you'd ask, Hesus.
- All right, let's go.

902
01:00:37,276 --> 01:00:38,833
Ahh.

903
01:00:39,954 --> 01:00:43,307
- All right! Shake them buns!
- Ooh! Like this?

904
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:45,622
Yeah.

905
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,659
<i>Hey, let 'em flap.</i>

906
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,656
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, here, let me.

907
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,527
Open wide for chunky!

908
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:13,529
Cool.

909
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:18,884
So you've been talking to the newspapers?

910
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,404
Yes, I have.

911
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:24,639
I don't know what your politics are,

912
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:29,308
but I've just got to say
newspapers are so screwed up.

913
01:01:30,997 --> 01:01:33,271
- Pardon my French.
- Really?

914
01:01:33,955 --> 01:01:37,911
I happen to have a few friends
who are associated with the popular press.

915
01:01:37,952 --> 01:01:39,748
- Maybe I can help you.
- Really?

916
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:41,348
Hey, toro! Hey-hey.

917
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,868
Ol!

918
01:01:44,428 --> 01:01:45,906
Ol!

919
01:01:48,025 --> 01:01:49,343
So...

920
01:01:49,384 --> 01:01:50,862
what's the plot?

921
01:01:50,903 --> 01:01:52,335
Arriba! Arriba!

922
01:01:52,382 --> 01:01:54,099
OK. Ready, man?

923
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:00,687
We have these secret documents
that prove there's going to be a war.

924
01:02:05,213 --> 01:02:09,283
I think maybe I have a solution for you.

925
01:02:12,448 --> 01:02:14,437
Already?

926
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,277
Have you written your Congressman?

927
01:02:18,323 --> 01:02:20,711
- That's a great idea, Lloyd.
- Good idea.

928
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,790
Hey, come on, follow me!

929
01:02:25,478 --> 01:02:28,070
Ah, da da-da-da da-da! Hey, still back there?

930
01:02:28,756 --> 01:02:30,745
Wooh, yeah-yeah!

931
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:32,670
(Boing!)
- Ooh!

932
01:02:32,713 --> 01:02:34,861
- (Laughs) Look what you've got.
- Oh.

933
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:38,940
Oh, I wouldn't. I wouldn't.

934
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,376
<i>- Magic fingers!
- Ooh!</i>

935
01:02:42,066 --> 01:02:47,819
They were going to put up some low-income
housing right across the street from the Huxley.

936
01:02:48,821 --> 01:02:54,131
Would've ruined the neighbourhood.
A lot of people thought it was a no-win situation.

937
01:02:54,178 --> 01:02:56,406
- Not me.
- Not Lloyd.

938
01:03:01,932 --> 01:03:03,330
No, sir.

939
01:03:03,371 --> 01:03:09,158
I telephoned my Congressman
and got action just like that.

940
01:03:09,926 --> 01:03:11,643
<i>JUNE: Clever man.</i>

941
01:03:14,163 --> 01:03:16,153
Wait a minute.

942
01:03:16,202 --> 01:03:20,192
You're telling me that some poor,
underprivileged human beings

943
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:24,434
were denied a place to live
because you called your Congressman?

944
01:03:24,476 --> 01:03:27,068
Yes! The system works.

945
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:30,590
You are a psychotic pig.

946
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:35,179
I don't know these people.
Did I say that to you, Lloyd? I've never met them.

947
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,582
- Oh.
- I'll just relieve myself.

948
01:03:37,626 --> 01:03:39,616
Oh, OK. Need a hand?

949
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,974
You can bring all three of them.

950
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:46,808
My friend, it's a hard world.

951
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,486
Life is what you make it
and we make it what we can.

952
01:03:50,537 --> 01:03:53,925
But there's never a cause to be abusive
at a cocktail party.

953
01:03:53,975 --> 01:03:55,487
- Absolutely right.
- Never.

954
01:03:55,534 --> 01:03:59,490
What is wrong with you, Sammy?
Have you changed that much? Huh?

955
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:03,558
Nah... fuck this.

956
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:06,243
I tell you time and time again,

957
01:04:06,286 --> 01:04:10,879
we'll be feeling the repercussions
of the drug culture for years to come.

958
01:04:10,923 --> 01:04:12,559
- Years.
- We should be going.

959
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:15,477
- Oh, Lloyd, please... Do something.
- April, where are you?

960
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,509
<i>- Lloyd, I'm sorry.
- April, come out of the bathroom.</i>

961
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:23,472
So, at that very moment,
with this gun pointed at my head,

962
01:04:23,514 --> 01:04:26,265
I saw this... this image of myself,

963
01:04:26,312 --> 01:04:28,380
this sort of um...

964
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:32,898
Joni Mitchell, Isadora Duncan,
naked wood nymph kind of a thing,

965
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:34,425
and it was this...

966
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:39,616
it was this... this precious spirit
that was gonna die if he pulled the trigger.

967
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:43,570
It was beautiful.

968
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,609
And...

969
01:04:45,658 --> 01:04:50,364
Now that there's no gun pointed at my head,
of course, I can't see it any more.

970
01:04:50,414 --> 01:04:52,404
<i>FRED: Petra, we're leaving.</i>

971
01:04:53,532 --> 01:04:56,203
What shall I do? Tell me.
Should I be spontaneous?

972
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:00,562
Please, Lloyd. Please don't go!
Sammy, do something.

973
01:05:01,886 --> 01:05:04,318
Hey, Sammy, what happened to you, man?

974
01:05:04,364 --> 01:05:06,831
You used to make fun of people like yourself.

975
01:05:06,882 --> 01:05:08,997
Sorry I took so long.

976
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:13,554
Sammy, thanks for letting us crash at your pad.
It was really groovy.

977
01:05:13,598 --> 01:05:15,473
Cool.

978
01:05:15,516 --> 01:05:17,187
What are you gonna do now?

979
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:22,260
I dunno. We'll probably go back to Ronnie's.
It's not your problem.

980
01:05:22,311 --> 01:05:24,062
<i>Hesus, let's go!</i>

981
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:27,818
(Sitar music)

982
01:05:30,985 --> 01:05:32,463
Hey.

983
01:05:32,504 --> 01:05:34,141
Peace.

984
01:05:34,183 --> 01:05:36,059
Far out.

985
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:39,614
One more. Come on, come on.
Pretend you're walking.

986
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:41,171
Whoa!

987
01:05:41,218 --> 01:05:43,014
<i>Come on.</i>

988
01:05:43,057 --> 01:05:46,763
<i>We're going toward the door now, sweetheart.
Toward the door.</i>

989
01:05:48,533 --> 01:05:49,726
Hey...

990
01:05:49,772 --> 01:05:51,761
do you have to go now?

991
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:54,243
Oh, yeah, well, my friends, you know...

992
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:55,845
- Oh.
- Yeah.

993
01:05:55,887 --> 01:05:58,922
- We could see a movie together some time.
- That'd be a good idea.

994
01:05:58,965 --> 01:06:00,317
- Great.
- God bless.

995
01:06:00,364 --> 01:06:01,921
- You be good.
- Ooh!

996
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:03,953
<i>Sammy, thanks for the cheese, man.</i>

997
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,877
- Have you been drinking?
- (Slurs) Just a little, honey.

998
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:08,715
Hey, catch you round.

999
01:06:09,518 --> 01:06:12,507
<i>- It's late. I'm afraid we have to be leaving.
- Please don't go.</i>

1000
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:17,068
What can I say to assure you that these
are not the kind of people we know?

1001
01:06:17,112 --> 01:06:19,908
I've always been against low-income housing.
Fuck the poor!

1002
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:22,542
Please give us another chance,
I'm begging you, Lloyd.

1003
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:24,305
- June.
- Please.

1004
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,655
<i>- Give us another chance. I'm begging you.
- June. June, come on.</i>

1005
01:06:27,705 --> 01:06:31,933
<i>Look out that window. Look out there.
In another day or so the last brick will be up.</i>

1006
01:06:31,981 --> 01:06:35,574
<i>I'll have no sunshine, no air, no view - I'll die!</i>

1007
01:06:36,738 --> 01:06:41,251
I'm sure you can understand that approving you
and your husband at this time

1008
01:06:41,295 --> 01:06:44,285
would not be in the best interests
of the Huxley tenants.

1009
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,925
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1010
01:06:46,971 --> 01:06:48,562
- No.
- It's all right.

1011
01:06:49,569 --> 01:06:51,365
Put your sweater on.

1012
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:55,795
<i>Don't worry. We'll get a bigger co-op
with more things in it. OK? Lt'll have more.</i>

1013
01:06:55,844 --> 01:06:58,720
- I'm never taking you any place again.
- I don't care.

1014
01:06:58,762 --> 01:07:01,036
- I hate you. I hate your mother.
- I'm driving.

1015
01:07:01,081 --> 01:07:04,866
- This isn't happening to me.
- Put your head down and take deep breaths.

1016
01:07:04,918 --> 01:07:07,749
<i>- It's like Invasion Of The Hippy People.
- What's happening?</i>

1017
01:07:07,796 --> 01:07:10,467
Can I just sit here for a second, Lloyd?

1018
01:07:10,514 --> 01:07:12,151
- (June sobs)
- Don't fight.

1019
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:14,182
- What's this?
- (Lloyd groans)

1020
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,221
Oh, don't you like it?

1021
01:07:17,269 --> 01:07:19,259
(Continues sobbing)

1022
01:07:22,265 --> 01:07:24,255
Lloyd,

1023
01:07:25,063 --> 01:07:27,053
may I walk you out?

1024
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:30,490
(Thud)

1025
01:07:32,698 --> 01:07:35,005
I'm fucking the... janitor.

1026
01:07:35,056 --> 01:07:37,285
- Of course.
- (June sobs)

1027
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:46,119
Ta-da!

1028
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:50,556
- Petra, you look so sweet.
- Wow. Wow, you look trippy.

1029
01:07:50,605 --> 01:07:52,595
- You look good.
(Knock at door)

1030
01:07:55,002 --> 01:07:56,991
Hi.

1031
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,553
Er... I came to apologise.

1032
01:08:00,678 --> 01:08:02,156
<i>I was a schmuck back there.</i>

1033
01:08:02,197 --> 01:08:05,664
You know? I felt really bad when you guys left.

1034
01:08:06,873 --> 01:08:08,510
You came to me for help. I'm sorry.

1035
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:10,420
Huh?

1036
01:08:15,787 --> 01:08:17,777
Ungowa.

1037
01:08:19,105 --> 01:08:21,094
Hey, check these out.

1038
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:22,894
- Shotgun?
PETRA: Cool.

1039
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:26,770
Yeah. Yeah, shotgun.

1040
01:08:31,016 --> 01:08:33,131
- Good one. Ooh.
- (Coughs)

1041
01:08:34,973 --> 01:08:37,485
(Laughs) A flash.

1042
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:43,520
Hey, man, did Ronnie seal this place off
when we left?

1043
01:08:43,567 --> 01:08:45,557
- Yeah, she did.
- It's the same.

1044
01:08:45,606 --> 01:08:46,958
Yeah, it is. Exactly.

1045
01:08:47,844 --> 01:08:49,242
<i>Wow.</i>

1046
01:08:49,283 --> 01:08:50,510
Ohh.

1047
01:08:50,562 --> 01:08:52,472
- Hey, your book, man.
- Hey, Sammy.

1048
01:08:52,521 --> 01:08:56,477
- Wow, man.
- Are you still writing, man? You were great.

1049
01:08:57,317 --> 01:08:59,432
No... I don't write any more.

1050
01:08:59,476 --> 01:09:03,307
<i>- Too bad.
- Yeah. I own... tanning salons.</i>

1051
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,301
BOTH: Huh?
- People pay me to get a tan.

1052
01:09:08,349 --> 01:09:10,339
BOTH: Oh.

1053
01:09:11,307 --> 01:09:12,705
Wow.

1054
01:09:13,506 --> 01:09:17,132
Hey, like, how do you get the sun to shine
just on those guys who pay, man?

1055
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:22,054
(Laughs) Right. Listen, um...

1056
01:09:23,059 --> 01:09:25,173
You guys, tell me what's happening. OK?

1057
01:09:25,217 --> 01:09:28,332
Because I'm here 100%. Just lay it out for me.

1058
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,648
We were walking down the street and...

1059
01:09:30,693 --> 01:09:33,251
and then these FBI guys grab us, man,

1060
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,281
and then they throw us in this car.

1061
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:37,683
I freak out cos I don't know what's happening.

1062
01:09:37,728 --> 01:09:41,002
I start choking on this one guy, and beating him,
and then we crash.

1063
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:43,239
And then there's blood and... a fish.

1064
01:09:43,284 --> 01:09:45,592
- You choked an FBI agent?
- No, a fish.

1065
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:48,155
Start at the beginning with the dead CIA agent.

1066
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:50,952
<i>- See, these revolutionaries...
- Dead CIA?</i>

1067
01:09:50,999 --> 01:09:53,352
Er... guys, am I in any danger here?

1068
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,829
BOTH: Oh, no.

1069
01:09:56,395 --> 01:09:59,112
Er, I'm having heavy dja vu, guys.

1070
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,540
There's a man here
from the Justice Department.

1071
01:10:01,591 --> 01:10:03,342
- Oh.
- Oh, shit, they found us.

1072
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:06,186
OK. I'll stall him. You go out the back way.

1073
01:10:06,228 --> 01:10:09,457
Hey, Sammy, let's go. Petra, come on. Hesus!

1074
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,495
Isn't this exciting?

1075
01:10:11,544 --> 01:10:13,817
Oh, man. Should I call my wife?

1076
01:10:13,862 --> 01:10:14,851
Nah.

1077
01:10:19,618 --> 01:10:22,084
God, I haven't sat in this park for years.

1078
01:10:23,256 --> 01:10:26,211
Yeah, not since that time you belly-danced
naked in the fountain.

1079
01:10:26,253 --> 01:10:28,243
So what are we doing?

1080
01:10:40,763 --> 01:10:43,036
We're taking over the campus.

1081
01:10:44,321 --> 01:10:45,469
Hah.

1082
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,476
Ungowa.

1083
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:52,354
Dig it.

1084
01:10:53,074 --> 01:10:54,791
But I don't know...

1085
01:10:55,512 --> 01:10:57,786
Hey, guys, why don't we just sing?

1086
01:10:57,831 --> 01:11:00,662
Wouldn't that be nice? We could sing songs.

1087
01:11:00,709 --> 01:11:03,346
 Kumbaya, my Lord

1088
01:11:03,387 --> 01:11:04,819
 Kumbaya

1089
01:11:05,505 --> 01:11:07,222
Come on, guys, just sing with me.

1090
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:10,379
 Kumbaya, my Lord...
Oh, what the hell?

1091
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,972
<i>SAMMY: OK, we got a war in Central America.
That's good. What else?</i>

1092
01:11:17,017 --> 01:11:18,449
<i>FRED: What do you mean?</i>

1093
01:11:18,496 --> 01:11:20,133
I mean, we have the floor.

1094
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:24,688
We can say what we want to say about anything,
so we have a responsibility to say it.

1095
01:11:24,732 --> 01:11:26,368
So, what else do we want to say?

1096
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,127
OK, well...

1097
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:33,716
I'm a little out of touch.
What's going on with the planet?

1098
01:11:34,405 --> 01:11:38,111
- You mean, what are we grieving about?
- Grievances, right. Well, um...

1099
01:11:38,801 --> 01:11:42,508
- The cost of real estate is outrageous.
- Good. OK. So, housing.

1100
01:11:42,559 --> 01:11:47,675
I mean, I paid two million dollars for my place
and I still pay $2,000 a month maintenance.

1101
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:49,352
<i>- Believe that?
- Are you crazy?</i>

1102
01:11:49,394 --> 01:11:51,508
Well, don't forget I've got walk-in closets.

1103
01:11:52,232 --> 01:11:54,664
<i>There's also nuclear energy. That's a problem.</i>

1104
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,540
OK. What's going on with that?

1105
01:11:57,548 --> 01:11:59,219
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

1106
01:11:59,267 --> 01:12:00,494
Pollution.

1107
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:04,456
There's the normal, everyday pollution
that nobody talks about any more,

1108
01:12:04,503 --> 01:12:06,299
and then there's this acid rain.

1109
01:12:06,342 --> 01:12:09,332
Acid rain? What is acid rain?

1110
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:12,813
- Well, it's just pollution.
- No, no. It gets in the rain, man.

1111
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,574
<i>- What does?
- The acid.</i>

1112
01:12:14,616 --> 01:12:17,651
<i>It's from the chemicals
going up in the smokestacks.</i>

1113
01:12:17,694 --> 01:12:21,001
Cheap perfumes. That sort of thing.
It goes up and gets in the clouds.

1114
01:12:21,051 --> 01:12:24,041
It turns into acid.
When it rains back down, it kills lakes.

1115
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:25,646
- That's it.
- It kills forests.

1116
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:27,756
- How about a Ring Ding?
- Here, dude.

1117
01:12:27,806 --> 01:12:30,319
- Whoa. (Crash)
- This is going on right now?

1118
01:12:30,364 --> 01:12:33,195
- What is anybody doing about it?
- It's like the ozone thing.

1119
01:12:33,242 --> 01:12:34,833
- The ozone thing?
- Yeah.

1120
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:37,996
I know what that is. That has
something to do with the deodorants.

1121
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:39,027
<i>No.</i>

1122
01:12:39,078 --> 01:12:42,113
Scientists figured out that we blew a hole
in the upper atmosphere.

1123
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:45,066
<i>- We blew a hole in the atmosphere?
- Yeah, man. It's the um...</i>

1124
01:12:45,114 --> 01:12:46,944
It's the fluorizones. Or er...

1125
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:48,391
Sammy!

1126
01:12:48,432 --> 01:12:50,785
Fluorides. No, shit, that's toothpaste.

1127
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,058
<i>- It's um...it's the sprays.
- It's the deodorants.</i>

1128
01:12:54,107 --> 01:12:57,495
OK, it's the aerosols,
from years and years of spraying this stuff.

1129
01:12:57,545 --> 01:13:02,093
It goes way up in the atmosphere,
blows a hole in the ozone and that can kill us.

1130
01:13:02,142 --> 01:13:04,813
- Are you hearing this?
- Oh, yeah, I got it.

1131
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,928
<i>You know what, we've got the housing.</i>

1132
01:13:06,978 --> 01:13:10,934
<i>We've got nuclear energy, we've got pollution.
We could dump those under big business.</i>

1133
01:13:10,975 --> 01:13:12,851
<i>And we need some more money going to Aids.</i>

1134
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,485
- Aids?
- Aids.

1135
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:19,808
It's this er... wrath of God, sort of plague thing
that's killing people all over the planet.

1136
01:13:19,849 --> 01:13:22,486
- Crack!
- Crack? Crack?

1137
01:13:22,527 --> 01:13:23,925
<i>Yeah, man, it's bad shit.</i>

1138
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,683
They smoke it.
It's like turning people into coconuts.

1139
01:13:26,724 --> 01:13:28,793
It's taken the old romantic edge off of drugs.

1140
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:33,038
- Cruise missiles that can destroy us in minutes.
- There's 40 wars going on right now.

1141
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:36,149
- Homeless. The homeless.
- Homeless, that's good. Cos that's bad.

1142
01:13:36,197 --> 01:13:38,107
- Farm foreclosures.
- Farms, yeah, man.

1143
01:13:38,156 --> 01:13:40,987
They're paying farmers not to grow.
They say there's too much food.

1144
01:13:41,034 --> 01:13:42,863
Too much? There are people starving.

1145
01:13:42,912 --> 01:13:45,663
And inflation's
gonna completely wipe out money.

1146
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:47,427
I mean, that's happening right now.

1147
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:50,982
The oceans and the trees are dying. What else?

1148
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:53,141
- You know what really pisses me off?
- What?

1149
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:55,458
They're colourising black-and-white movies.

1150
01:13:55,503 --> 01:13:58,971
<i>I just saw It's A Wonderful Life in colour,
and I have to admit I just loved it.</i>

1151
01:13:59,021 --> 01:14:01,328
<i>Are you crazy?
They look like they have hepatitis.</i>

1152
01:14:01,379 --> 01:14:03,687
<i>- I loved it.
- Are you hearing this?</i>

1153
01:14:03,738 --> 01:14:07,887
Don't you understand it is a total violation
of the director's point of view.

1154
01:14:07,935 --> 01:14:09,685
(Clattering)

1155
01:14:09,733 --> 01:14:11,643
Let's leave that one off the list.

1156
01:14:11,692 --> 01:14:14,999
There are people dying,
and you tell me there is acid in the forest.

1157
01:14:15,049 --> 01:14:19,006
There are missiles, there are plagues.
I'm standing here and it's like...

1158
01:14:19,047 --> 01:14:23,037
And it's like... I'm getting these...
"I don't care about my planet" vibes, right?

1159
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:26,551
And I mean, it's like you people
act like you don't care at all.

1160
01:14:26,601 --> 01:14:28,556
Where is your outrage?

1161
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,191
- I am outraged.
- No, you're not.

1162
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,989
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1163
01:14:32,037 --> 01:14:34,469
I am outraged!

1164
01:14:36,154 --> 01:14:41,384
My name is Anus McVitie and I'm truly outraged
for I'm a victim of acid rain.

1165
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:44,102
Oh, man, Sammy, your eyes.
Hey, I don't want acid rain.

1166
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:47,297
- It's cool, it's cool.
- Cos I wouldn't like the jungle, man.

1167
01:14:47,346 --> 01:14:48,744
It's cool, it's cool.

1168
01:14:49,745 --> 01:14:54,292
Sammy, what have you done about these?
Have you done one thing about any of them?

1169
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:56,978
- Huh?
- What the hell are you talking about?

1170
01:14:57,019 --> 01:14:58,770
Where were you, man? You disappeared.

1171
01:14:58,818 --> 01:15:02,252
<i>There's holes in the atmosphere.
Why don't you know about any of this stuff?</i>

1172
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:04,683
- Yeah, Fred, where were you?
- Where was I?

1173
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:07,371
You wanna know where I was?
I'll tell you where I was.

1174
01:15:07,412 --> 01:15:10,482
The war was coming to an end, right?
So things were slowing down.

1175
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:12,996
Well, I got an idea.

1176
01:15:13,048 --> 01:15:17,163
I was going to create a utopian society.

1177
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:19,194
Yeah.

1178
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,153
It was going to be beautiful.

1179
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:23,872
What happened?

1180
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:28,549
We had our first meeting. We er...

1181
01:15:28,597 --> 01:15:31,314
We built our huts. We er...

1182
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,583
...planted our grass.

1183
01:15:37,191 --> 01:15:38,702
We harvested our grass.

1184
01:15:39,429 --> 01:15:41,702
- We smoked the grass.
- Dig it.

1185
01:15:41,747 --> 01:15:43,737
<i>PETRA: Then what happened?</i>

1186
01:15:46,824 --> 01:15:49,779
<i>- Fred?
- Wait a minute, I'm trying to remember.</i>

1187
01:15:49,821 --> 01:15:52,697
There's nothing to remember.
You've been stoned for 20 years.

1188
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:55,968
Where do you get the gall to come up here
and lay all this crap on us?

1189
01:15:56,017 --> 01:15:58,404
You're pointing fingers and shit
and you are wrong!

1190
01:15:58,455 --> 01:16:02,730
<i>For the last two decades you've been in Oz
blowing your brains out with grass.</i>

1191
01:16:05,091 --> 01:16:07,284
What am I going to say to you, man?

1192
01:16:14,644 --> 01:16:16,633
He's right.

1193
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,030
I ran away.

1194
01:16:22,718 --> 01:16:24,707
I totally copped out.

1195
01:16:26,835 --> 01:16:29,028
- It's OK, Fred.
- No.

1196
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:32,021
No.

1197
01:16:32,071 --> 01:16:33,708
It's not OK.

1198
01:16:41,145 --> 01:16:43,134
What are we gonna do?

1199
01:16:44,782 --> 01:16:47,499
<i>Oh, what is the difference, man?</i>

1200
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,018
I mean...

1201
01:16:49,059 --> 01:16:53,811
What's the difference if we did do something
or we didn't, or we might do something?

1202
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:56,368
The thing is, we're here now,
so just be here now.

1203
01:16:57,253 --> 01:16:59,083
That's all I gotta say.

1204
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:09,476
I know where we were after the harvest, man.
We were dreaming about tonight.

1205
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:12,753
We were dreaming about a night
when we could all be together again.

1206
01:17:12,802 --> 01:17:15,712
And here we are... 20 years later.
It's blowing my mind.

1207
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,114
We've been brought back together for a reason,
man. It's destiny, I know it. You know?

1208
01:17:21,196 --> 01:17:23,389
That's all I gotta say.

1209
01:17:25,673 --> 01:17:27,468
Who cares if we dropped out?

1210
01:17:27,511 --> 01:17:31,468
What difference does it make?
Here we are, man. You know?

1211
01:17:31,509 --> 01:17:33,145
We're together.

1212
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:35,746
We've got a second chance. You know?

1213
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,934
And it's like in the olden days, man.

1214
01:17:37,984 --> 01:17:43,008
It's like, if it's only for one night,
anything's possible. (Chuckles)

1215
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:47,130
You know, it's like the future of the world
is in our hands one more time.

1216
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,924
(Laughter)

1217
01:18:08,882 --> 01:18:11,872
 There's been a fever

1218
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:15,871
 Stand up and fight...

1219
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,871
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1220
01:18:17,915 --> 01:18:20,427
Some assholes
have locked us out of our classes.

1221
01:18:20,473 --> 01:18:22,667
What does that mean? Are we off?

1222
01:18:27,548 --> 01:18:29,663
 Stand up for hope

1223
01:18:29,707 --> 01:18:33,822
 We are the answer

1224
01:18:33,864 --> 01:18:35,455
 To it all...

1225
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:37,492
Hello, students of NYU.

1226
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:42,087
 Stand up and fight

1227
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:43,775
 We're gonna stand up and fight

1228
01:18:43,817 --> 01:18:45,806
Hippies have taken over the campus.

1229
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:50,403
Sound familiar? Well, that's exactly what
has happened here at New York University.

1230
01:18:51,091 --> 01:18:54,684
Four unidentified demonstrators
have taken over Wilson Hall

1231
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:58,196
in protest against the war in Central America.

1232
01:18:58,246 --> 01:19:01,042
You may be asking
which war in Central America.

1233
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:06,201
If so, count yourself among the many students
here who are equally confused.

1234
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:07,514
How's that?

1235
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,833
OFFICER: It's the top floor.

1236
01:19:08,879 --> 01:19:11,869
The police are here.
Somebody better do something.

1237
01:19:11,917 --> 01:19:14,190
Come on, man.

1238
01:19:14,235 --> 01:19:16,542
Look at the people down there,
it's like a concert.

1239
01:19:16,593 --> 01:19:18,583
OK. Cool. OK.

1240
01:19:19,831 --> 01:19:21,229
- How's my hair?
- Beautiful.

1241
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:25,499
- OK, guys, give me a good first line.
- Fred, listen, I got something for you.

1242
01:19:25,547 --> 01:19:28,105
Listen, I couldn't sleep last night,
so I wrote you that.

1243
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:30,532
- Sammy...
- You don't have to use it.

1244
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:33,300
This is great, man. Thanks.
Thank you very much.

1245
01:19:33,341 --> 01:19:34,739
Yeah. Mm.

1246
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,690
- Yeah. I say...
- (Grunts) Ungowa!

1247
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:39,728
- Dig it.
- All right, man.

1248
01:19:46,772 --> 01:19:48,761
Oh...

1249
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:51,318
Hi. Hi.

1250
01:19:53,207 --> 01:19:56,958
First let me apologise
for taking over this building. I er...

1251
01:19:57,004 --> 01:19:59,721
I know you're all eager to get to your classes.

1252
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:03,875
<i>But what we're doing here is very important.</i>

1253
01:20:06,078 --> 01:20:10,148
In a couple of months
there is going to be a secret US operation

1254
01:20:10,195 --> 01:20:15,663
to overthrow a small Central American country
and start a war.

1255
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:19,303
That's a war in which Americans
will be asked to fight.

1256
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:22,854
<i>I came here to tell you about a war.</i>

1257
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,178
<i>But I realise that something more important,</i>

1258
01:20:26,223 --> 01:20:28,611
more fundamental has got to be said.

1259
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:31,414
Oh.

1260
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,972
- Where's the rest of it?
- There's another page.

1261
01:20:34,018 --> 01:20:36,132
<i>No, there's not.</i>

1262
01:20:36,176 --> 01:20:38,166
(Papers rustle)

1263
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,081
Ah...

1264
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:47,562
I ran out of papers, man. I smoked it.

1265
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:52,356
You want some?

1266
01:21:05,155 --> 01:21:05,951
<i>Er...</i>

1267
01:21:07,753 --> 01:21:12,619
Last night I found out that pretty soon this planet,

1268
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:15,546
our hope, our Mother Earth...

1269
01:21:17,387 --> 01:21:19,853
...will not be able to support life.

1270
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:23,656
We won't be able to breathe,
we won't be able to swim,

1271
01:21:23,702 --> 01:21:25,895
<i>we won't be able to walk in the sun.</i>

1272
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:27,773
<i>Now, I believe</i>

1273
01:21:27,819 --> 01:21:31,695
<i>that God made us from this earth
with a purpose.</i>

1274
01:21:31,736 --> 01:21:35,249
<i>To be her ears, to be her eyes.</i>

1275
01:21:35,294 --> 01:21:39,284
But we stopped seeing and we're not listening.

1276
01:21:39,331 --> 01:21:43,765
And pretty soon if we don't open our hearts,
and our minds, then that's it.

1277
01:21:43,808 --> 01:21:46,320
The end.

1278
01:21:46,366 --> 01:21:50,356
<i>I know a lot has changed since the '60s.</i>

1279
01:21:50,403 --> 01:21:56,746
But I still believe that in each one of us,
in every individual, there is this light.

1280
01:21:56,798 --> 01:21:58,150
This spirit.

1281
01:21:58,197 --> 01:22:01,631
It's a beautiful spirit and it says, "I want to live.

1282
01:22:01,675 --> 01:22:03,550
I want to live in peace.

1283
01:22:03,593 --> 01:22:05,389
I want to live in beauty.

1284
01:22:05,432 --> 01:22:07,547
I want to live the way God designed it."

1285
01:22:09,749 --> 01:22:13,705
Now the only way we are going to change
the situation here is...

1286
01:22:13,746 --> 01:22:15,258
if you...

1287
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:16,703
and you...

1288
01:22:16,744 --> 01:22:19,256
and you, and everybody here...

1289
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:21,814
would get everybody they know.

1290
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:25,373
And everybody they know will get
everybody they know to come together

1291
01:22:25,418 --> 01:22:29,966
<i>as one relentless force and fight
for the kind of world we want to live in.</i>

1292
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:33,003
A world for our children.

1293
01:22:34,811 --> 01:22:37,482
<i>This is our responsibility.</i>

1294
01:22:38,808 --> 01:22:43,196
To serve with love this great spirit
we share with each other,

1295
01:22:43,245 --> 01:22:46,474
and with this earth, our home.

1296
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,598
<i>LOUDSPEAKER:
Wilson Hall will be closed today.</i>

1297
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:55,311
<i>All scheduled classes will be transferred
to the following locations.</i>

1298
01:22:55,356 --> 01:22:57,744
<i>Please listen for your class numbers.</i>

1299
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:03,184
<i>- Behavioural psychology 103...
- Where are you going?</i>

1300
01:23:03,231 --> 01:23:05,868
Where is everybody going?
You've got a chance to help here.

1301
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:09,103
<i>Economics 102 will be in the Students' Centre.</i>

1302
01:23:09,146 --> 01:23:11,818
I have proof there is going to be a war.

1303
01:23:11,864 --> 01:23:15,377
<i>- This is great. Get the disillusionment.
- You've got a chance to help.</i>

1304
01:23:15,422 --> 01:23:17,615
There is going to be a war.

1305
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:20,855
<i>Don't you care that our world is dying?</i>

1306
01:23:20,898 --> 01:23:23,456
<i>Don't you care about our trees and our oceans?</i>

1307
01:23:23,496 --> 01:23:25,611
<i>Please, listen to me.</i>

1308
01:23:25,655 --> 01:23:27,167
<i>We have to care.</i>

1309
01:23:28,213 --> 01:23:30,645
- Where are they going?
- Come on down, man.

1310
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,758
<i>Come on, man.</i>

1311
01:23:32,809 --> 01:23:36,163
<i>- English Literature 104, the Nelson Building.
- Come on down, man.</i>

1312
01:23:36,207 --> 01:23:39,402
- (Tannoy announcements continue)
- Hey, let's get the fuck out of here.

1313
01:23:39,445 --> 01:23:42,241
Let's get out of here.
Come on, come on. Come on.

1314
01:23:58,551 --> 01:24:00,744
I wanna go home, man.

1315
01:24:03,148 --> 01:24:05,182
I don't know. This is good.

1316
01:24:05,226 --> 01:24:07,022
This is very good.

1317
01:24:07,065 --> 01:24:11,101
I've been waiting... 20 years
to knock the shit out of you hippy assholes.

1318
01:24:11,142 --> 01:24:13,132
And here I am. (Laughs)

1319
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:16,848
So, er... where are the papers?

1320
01:24:19,176 --> 01:24:20,244
Eat shit!

1321
01:24:20,295 --> 01:24:21,932
See! See!

1322
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,611
See, that's what...

1323
01:24:23,653 --> 01:24:25,085
It's people like you...

1324
01:24:25,132 --> 01:24:30,839
I mean, you just chisel away at a work of art
that it took 200 years to build.

1325
01:24:30,888 --> 01:24:32,956
You got it wrong, man.

1326
01:24:33,006 --> 01:24:35,235
We love this country.

1327
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:37,035
Well...

1328
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:39,642
- Well, then give me the papers.
- Eat shit!

1329
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:45,915
You are a goddamn traitor and you will
do anything to embarrass this country.

1330
01:24:47,436 --> 01:24:49,868
I am an American.

1331
01:24:49,914 --> 01:24:52,380
I am duty-bound to make this country better.

1332
01:25:00,027 --> 01:25:01,937
- Give me those papers.
- Eat shit.

1333
01:25:05,783 --> 01:25:06,737
(Click)

1334
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:12,848
(High-pitched)  Oh, say can you see

1335
01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:17,093
 By the dawn's early light

1336
01:25:17,135 --> 01:25:22,000
 O beautiful for spacious skies

1337
01:25:22,051 --> 01:25:27,042
 For amber waves of green

1338
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:30,794
 Doo-wah, diddy, diddy-dum, diddy-do

1339
01:25:30,845 --> 01:25:33,198
 Doo-wah, diddy, diddy...

1340
01:25:33,243 --> 01:25:34,436
All right!

1341
01:25:36,481 --> 01:25:38,947
Oh, you think you're a big genius, don't you?

1342
01:25:40,998 --> 01:25:46,307
Well, let me tell you, Mr Gandhi,

1343
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:48,343
those plans, those papers...

1344
01:25:49,032 --> 01:25:50,703
...they're fake.

1345
01:25:52,669 --> 01:25:55,340
- Eat shit.
- Eat shit, I know.

1346
01:25:55,387 --> 01:25:58,263
If you could read,
you would've read the first two pages

1347
01:25:58,305 --> 01:26:01,261
that state that the plan
is a hypothetical scenario.

1348
01:26:01,303 --> 01:26:03,293
You see? It's a game we play.

1349
01:26:04,261 --> 01:26:06,057
A big "What if?"

1350
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:09,089
I mean, we're composing plans like that
all the time.

1351
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,445
You're a fool.

1352
01:26:13,494 --> 01:26:15,484
You're a...

1353
01:26:16,732 --> 01:26:19,119
You're a big fat fool.

1354
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:25,960
(Yells) Now where are the goddamn papers?

1355
01:26:42,433 --> 01:26:45,185
 Newsreel fanfare

1356
01:26:45,231 --> 01:26:49,347
<i>I'd like to expose a heinous crime
that's about to be committed by this country.</i>

1357
01:26:49,389 --> 01:26:51,503
(Newsreel music)

1358
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:05,772
<i>Excuse me. Are you for or against sending
American soldiers into Central America?</i>

1359
01:27:05,817 --> 01:27:10,568
We haven't won anything in so long,
it would be nice.

1360
01:27:11,613 --> 01:27:16,603
<i>Sir? Excuse me, sir? Are you for or against
sending American troops into Central America?</i>

1361
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:20,525
Well, I'm a liberal Republican.
I believe we should go to war, but...

1362
01:27:20,566 --> 01:27:22,953
I also think
we should put the homeless in uniform

1363
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:25,721
and give them an opportunity
to lead productive lives.

1364
01:27:25,762 --> 01:27:27,080
You think about that.

1365
01:27:27,881 --> 01:27:29,438
Nuke 'em!

1366
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,832
(Machine-gun fire)

1367
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:32,868
(Explosions boom)

1368
01:27:45,348 --> 01:27:48,941
So you started a war. Shit happens.

1369
01:27:50,385 --> 01:27:52,817
You know, it could be good.

1370
01:27:52,863 --> 01:27:55,091
- War. That can be a good thing.
- What?

1371
01:27:55,141 --> 01:27:57,937
Listen to what I'm saying.
At least it gets people motivated.

1372
01:27:57,979 --> 01:27:59,616
I do feel motivated.

1373
01:27:59,658 --> 01:28:03,205
I'm sorry. I'm furious and I'm loving it,
and it's because of you.

1374
01:28:04,415 --> 01:28:06,973
I started a fucking war!

1375
01:28:07,013 --> 01:28:10,083
Well, that's true.

1376
01:28:10,131 --> 01:28:14,007
But now you can try and stop it and maybe
some other things that need stopping.

1377
01:28:14,048 --> 01:28:15,196
What for?

1378
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:17,634
We could get the Headroom happening again.
Ronnie?

1379
01:28:17,685 --> 01:28:19,037
Are you kidding?

1380
01:28:19,084 --> 01:28:21,153
I'd close this place in a second.

1381
01:28:21,203 --> 01:28:23,590
Come on, man. I'll keep writing, all right?

1382
01:28:23,641 --> 01:28:26,756
We can get the movement happening again.
We'll just make 'em listen.

1383
01:28:26,799 --> 01:28:29,186
Yeah. Um...

1384
01:28:30,956 --> 01:28:33,343
You can always stay with me and er...

1385
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:37,468
I know that you don't have anybody special
to go home to. And...

1386
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:40,659
We're all here and...

1387
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:42,698
we'd like you to stay...

1388
01:28:44,266 --> 01:28:46,256
I'd like you to stay.

1389
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:49,853
Honey...

1390
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:01,529
(Exhales slowly)

1391
01:29:02,613 --> 01:29:04,806
I can't stay here.

1392
01:29:05,691 --> 01:29:07,600
I'm sorry.

1393
01:29:07,649 --> 01:29:11,526
- Hey, Hesus, let's go.
- Fred, let us know where you're going.

1394
01:29:12,206 --> 01:29:14,196
I love you, Ronnie.

1395
01:29:15,404 --> 01:29:19,155
- Hey, you too.
- Yeah.

1396
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:20,553
Peace.

1397
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,794
All right!

1398
01:29:22,838 --> 01:29:25,953
The world's rotten! People suck.

1399
01:29:25,996 --> 01:29:27,906
Stay.

1400
01:29:27,955 --> 01:29:29,944
Just stay, man.

1401
01:29:37,508 --> 01:29:38,826

 BILL MEDLEY: Rude Awakening

1403
01:29:51,898 --> 01:29:54,285
 Tried to catch the moon

1404
01:29:55,415 --> 01:29:58,928
 Tried to count the stars

1405
01:29:58,973 --> 01:30:01,962
 Tried to run as fast as I can

1406
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,520
 In my darkest hours

1407
01:30:06,127 --> 01:30:08,321
 I hear a lot of laughter

1408
01:30:09,765 --> 01:30:11,754
 I've seen a lot of pain...

1409
01:30:13,442 --> 01:30:17,035
Look, I don't know where I'm going
so if you wanna stay that's OK.

1410
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:20,307
I'm with you, bro.

1411
01:30:20,357 --> 01:30:22,347
I've had enough pizza, man.

1412
01:30:22,396 --> 01:30:24,510
 What have they done?

1413
01:30:27,312 --> 01:30:29,541
 Where?

1414
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,580
 Where have they gone?

1415
01:30:34,587 --> 01:30:36,577
 Why?

1416
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:39,424
 Why have they changed?

1417
01:30:40,743 --> 01:30:43,130
 In the concrete jungle

1418
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,407
 I open my eyes

1419
01:30:46,459 --> 01:30:47,573
(Sobs)

1420
01:30:47,618 --> 01:30:50,494
 To a rude awakening

1421
01:30:54,852 --> 01:30:57,524
 To a rude awakening

1422
01:31:02,527 --> 01:31:04,517
Ungowa.

1423
01:31:05,725 --> 01:31:07,714
(Continues sobbing)

1424
01:31:16,517 --> 01:31:18,074
Mr Wouk.

1425
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:21,512
Mr Wouk, my name is Lawrence.

1426
01:31:21,553 --> 01:31:23,508
Lawrence Tilby. And er...

1427
01:31:24,311 --> 01:31:26,904
We all heard you speak at NYU.

1428
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:28,939
And er... let me just tell you,

1429
01:31:28,988 --> 01:31:33,103
I live right across the river
and there's this goddamn plant over there.

1430
01:31:33,145 --> 01:31:38,659
And they're pouring millions of gallons
of all this toxic crap into the river.

1431
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:41,088
And nobody seems to give a shit.

1432
01:31:41,139 --> 01:31:43,129
And after I heard you speak, well,

1433
01:31:43,178 --> 01:31:46,645
a few of us got together and...
Seth's got this brother.

1434
01:31:46,695 --> 01:31:49,049
- I have a brother who...
- In Cleveland.

1435
01:31:49,094 --> 01:31:51,845
And he's got this major problem
where he lives too.

1436
01:31:51,892 --> 01:31:54,085
The river caught on fire.

1437
01:31:55,049 --> 01:31:57,437
- The river caught on fire?
- Yeah.

1438
01:31:57,488 --> 01:31:59,841
So we thought maybe we should do something.

1439
01:31:59,886 --> 01:32:02,603
- Co-ordinate some sort of an action.
- Wait a minute.

1440
01:32:02,644 --> 01:32:05,236
The water in the river actually caught on fire?

1441
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:07,110
Yeah.

1442
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,756
- Oh, I'd like to see that, man.
- (Chuckles)

1443
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:17,953
We wanna co-ordinate
some kind of action between us

1444
01:32:17,993 --> 01:32:20,949
and we thought maybe you could help us
put something together.

1445
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:22,389
We're really glad we found you.

1446
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:24,783
<i>We loved what you said at school.
I mean, really.</i>

1447
01:32:24,828 --> 01:32:28,057
Yeah, we're not gonna fight some war
that somebody made up.

1448
01:32:28,106 --> 01:32:30,902
See, Mr Wouk? Some of us did hear ya.

1449
01:32:30,944 --> 01:32:32,819
<i>We did. Oh, yeah.</i>

1450
01:32:32,862 --> 01:32:35,852
So... will you help us?

1451
01:33:02,281 --> 01:33:06,715
- Hey, Hesus. What is it, man?
(Metallic clattering)

1452
01:33:13,753 --> 01:33:16,140
(Coughing and spluttering)

1453
01:33:19,549 --> 01:33:20,537
Wow!

1454
01:33:24,066 --> 01:33:26,055
So it's true.

1455
01:33:26,104 --> 01:33:28,491
The river really did catch on fire.

1456
01:33:28,542 --> 01:33:31,737
What do you think, I'm an hallucination?

1457
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,770
- (Fish continues spluttering)
- Hey. Peace.

1458
01:33:36,057 --> 01:33:37,648
Oh...

1459
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,128
Smoked fish.

1460
01:33:39,175 --> 01:33:41,164
(Cackles)

1461
01:33:43,252 --> 01:33:45,639
Smoked fish!

1462
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:47,759
