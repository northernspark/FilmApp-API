00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:49,993
They lost 83!

307
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:53,092
Now, are we gonna go to war
with Yemen over it?

308
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:56,935
We're covering our ass all over
the Middle East right now, General.

309
00:32:57,006 --> 00:32:59,566
Because of your man's
hotheaded miscalculation,

310
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:03,908
we are in danger of losing embassies
in Saudi, Jordan and Egypt.

311
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,676
We're in danger
of losing our presence...

312
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,583
with every moderate
in the region.

313
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:11,950
Now they're gonna scream
"cover up."

314
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:15,252
The screaming will get so loud we'll
be sending Marines back over there,

315
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:18,726
and the body count of American
dead is gonna be higher than three.

316
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:24,226
I see where you're going
with this, Mr. Sokal.

317
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,564
Will you be needing me
anymore today?

318
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:29,996
No.

319
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:32,405
No, thats fine, General.
Thank you.

320

Good day to you, sir.

[Sighs] Where do you think
you're going with that?

322
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:56,221
- You don't want to look at it.
- Nobody's lookin' at it.

323
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,733
Why should the United States
be held responsible...

324
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:02,670
for the actions of one man?

325
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:05,105
What if the crowd
had weapons?

326
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,700
What if this shows
they did fire first?

327
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:10,905
He could have fired over
their heads, this moron!

328
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,608
Didn't he know where he was?
The Middle East!

329
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:15,378
He could have isolated
on the snipers.

330
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:16,942
He could have
avoided confrontation.

331
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,352
He could have done
50 fuckin' things!

332
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:21,720
Instead, he destroyed a fragile
trust, put his own men in danger...

333
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:25,283
Fuck this guy!
Forget this tape.

334
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:29,297
I don't want to watch it.
I don't want to testify about it.

335

344
00:35:20,135 --> 00:35:24,094
[Sighs]
You know the drill.

345
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:29,577
This is the Article 32
investigation.

346
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:31,704
You're facing
a general court-martial...

347
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,578
and charged with violation
of at least three articles...

348
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,210
everything from "breach of peace"
to "conduct unbecoming."

349
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:43,156
But the bottom line... 83 counts,
violation of Article 118, murder.

350
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,159
You issued an illegal order
to have your marines...

351
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:48,458
fire into a group
of innocent civilians.

352
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,930
Murder, sir?

353
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,566
I'm the convening authority, so I've
gotta get this B.S. Out of the way.

Sign here, initial here.

355
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:12,445
You're not a flight risk, so there
won't be any pretrial confinement.

356
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:18,959
This court-martial convenes
in eight days...

357
00:36:19,027 --> 00:36:24,021
by direct order of
the national command authority.

I lost marines. The crowd
was hostile. They fired on us.

They fired first, sir.

364
00:36:54,396 --> 00:36:57,331

I don't want some Starbucks
drinker who's never seen combat.

380

No, wait a minute.

Gentlemen, this
is Major Mark Biggs.

389
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,357
He'll be prosecuting
the Childers court-martial.

390
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:39,866
The marines put the major
through Stanford Law,

391
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:43,371
and he owes them a couple of years
before he takes over the world.

392
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,372
<i>You know General Lowry.</i>

393
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,533
<i>I'd like you to meet the general</i>
<i>of theJoint Chiefs of Staff,</i>

394
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:50,476
General West, and the secretary
of Defense, Mr. Wyatt.

395
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:52,479
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

396
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:56,347
What I gather from our esteemed NSC
advisor and secretary of state...

397
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,613
is that we've got a trial
in two weeks.

398
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:01,986
- Seems awfully damned fast.
- Everyone in this room will agree...

399
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:04,787
its in the national interest that
this trial be moved along quickly.

400
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,660
The Article 32 investigation
was complete and comprehensive.

401
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,459
It all seems to point
in one direction.

402
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:11,897
Has he got a lawyer yet?

403
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,902
He's requested a military
attorney, Colonel Hayes Hodges.

404
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,700
Second Marine Division, Lejeune.

405
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,467
Any relation to
General H. Lawrence Hodges?

406
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,667
His son.

407
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:23,404
Larry Hodges was one of this country's
most distinguished officers.

408
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:25,639
What do we know about
Colonel Hayes Hodges?

409
00:39:25,714 --> 00:39:28,148
He's a guy who got
blown apart in Vietnam,

410
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:30,912
then went to Georgetown Law
and became a cynic.

411
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:32,920
Is that about right, Major?

412
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:35,081
He was 67th in his class
at Georgetown, sir.

413
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:38,023
He doesn't take too many cases,
doesn't win too many.

414
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:40,857
He apparently went through an ugly
divorce, had a drinking problem,

415
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:45,491
- <i>retiring in two weeks.</i>
- Can we guarantee we get this guy?

416
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:48,092
Sir, if I may
say something?

417
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:51,330
I am not a hired gun.

418
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:52,839
I accepted this assignment...

419
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:55,274
'cause I believe in the merits
of the governments case.

420
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:57,538
I am not gonna stack the deck
against this guy.

421
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:00,445
I will try this case
on good evidence only.

422

00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:43,043
Your friend
Colonel Childers.

456
00:42:43,111 --> 00:42:46,342
- Guilty of what, sir?
- Come on, Hayes.

457
00:42:46,414 --> 00:42:50,043
You served with him. Is he the rabid
dog we've all been hearing about?

458
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:51,881
I don't think
I should comment, sir.

459
00:42:51,953 --> 00:42:55,013
Come on, Dad. This is family.
You can lighten up a little.

460
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,024
You know what we said
at the naval academy.

461
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:59,993
Even if you thought
you weren't responsible,

462
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:02,495
it went wrong
and you were there.

463
00:43:02,564 --> 00:43:04,327
Since when have you
not had a comment?

464
00:43:04,399 --> 00:43:06,162
Since Childers asked me
to defend him.

465
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:08,031
<i>[Man] No. Oh, Hayes.</i>

466
00:43:08,103 --> 00:43:10,537
- [Woman] What?
<i>- [Son] Excuse me.</i>

467
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:12,869
- Are you kidding me?
- <i>No.</i>

468
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:16,138
Why would you do that?
Huh!

469
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:18,975
- Because he asked me, and I owe him.
- Thats great.

470
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:22,505
That represents everything
thats wrong with the military.

471
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:24,518
Wisdom from the one person
in this family...

472
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:27,749
who has not elected
to serve his country.

473
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,756
Childers must have snapped.
It happens in combat.

474
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:32,918
I've seen it.
I'm sure you have too.

475
00:43:32,994 --> 00:43:34,928
Thank you for reminding me...

476
00:43:34,996 --> 00:43:37,794
why we have the presumption
of innocence in America.

477
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,767
[Scoffs] What are you, Abraham
Lincoln? You can't hide behind that.

478
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,735
The guy murdered innocent women
and children.

479
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:44,863
- You hear that on television?
- And newspapers.

480
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:47,499
- Its all over the place.
- Its Mom and Daïs anniversary.

481
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,043
Don't take this case, son.

482
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:00,883
This man has trashed
the reputation of the Corps.

483
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:02,980
He's put us back 20 years.

484
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,495
Is this how you want
to be remembered?

485
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,260
I don't see how I can
turn him down. He saved my life.

486
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:15,234
Well, I understand that
as well as anyone.

487
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:20,240
But you don't repay him by
falling senselessly on a grenade.

488
00:44:20,308 --> 00:44:23,334
The way I see it,
this man should find himself...

489
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:27,575
- the best laywer in the country.
- Somebody better than me?

490
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,177
The guy's
a real marine, Dad.

491
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,949
I mean, if they
can do this to him...

492
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:38,390
just hang him out to dry...
they can do it to anybody.

493
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:42,452
Forget that he's my friend.
They can do it to anybody.

494
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,021
That means your medals
and your citations...

495
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,068
won't mean jack shit
when they come after you.

00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,743
that he didn't have
to open fire, sir.

499
00:44:59,814 --> 00:45:03,750
Nobody reports seeing any
weapons among the demonstrators.

500
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:06,981
- His psych eval was a disaster.
- What about embassy footage?

501
00:45:07,055 --> 00:45:09,489
Cameras, film, videotape,
home movies, shit like that?

502
00:45:09,557 --> 00:45:14,654
No, I've subpoenaed everything.
The embassy got hit pretty good.

503
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:18,096
- Most of it was destroyed.

Terry, you know Tom Chandler. He's
gonna help us prepare your case.

506
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:28,602
Colonel Childers, good to see
you again, sir. Um, all right.

507
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:32,578
First, we've subpoenaed all
the Article 32 investigator's notes,

508
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,581
the State Departments
notes on Yemen.

509
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:38,141
Major Biggs has already had
your head checked by their doctor.

510
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:40,016
I've got you an appointment
with ours.

511
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:42,113
- No.
- What?

512
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,159
No more multiple choice
questions about self-esteem.

513
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:47,922
We got the combat fitness reports.
He can forget the psych eval here.

514
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:49,691
Thats a mistake, Colonel.

515
00:45:49,764 --> 00:45:53,495
Listen, when I turned 18
I joined the Marine Corps.

516
00:45:53,568 --> 00:45:55,536
I asked to be in the infantry.

517
00:45:55,603 --> 00:45:58,003
- I asked to go to Vietnam.
- Terry.

518
00:45:58,072 --> 00:46:00,336
I live for the privilege
of commanding troops.

519
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:02,899
I think its the greatest honor
an American can have.

520
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:05,605
You know how many birthdays
and Christmases I missed,

521
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,614
spent rotting in jungles
or in the desert,

522
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,616
just so you could play
war at ROTC?

523
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:14,121
Childers! You gotta keep
your shit together here, man.

524
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,622
Your court-martial board
is gonna be made up of people...

525
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,125
who mightve spent one day in
Grenada, maybe two days in Kuwait.

526
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,627
They're gonna be beach boys who've
never been anywhere near combat.

527
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,323
They're gonna be people
like Tom Chandler...

528
00:46:23,398 --> 00:46:25,127
sitting right here in front of you.

529
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,225
Thats who you're
making your case to.

530
00:46:28,303 --> 00:46:32,239
We don't have anybody
to back up your case.

531
00:46:32,307 --> 00:46:35,333
Thats because
all my witnesses are dead.

532
00:46:37,078 --> 00:46:40,445
- Okay. So what happened?
- He lost it. He snapped.

533
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:42,346
Thats good.
We can snap him on the stand.

534
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:44,009
This doesn't happen in a vacuum.

535
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:46,519
Lets get a complete history
of Colonel Childers.

536
00:46:46,587 --> 00:46:49,181
Talk to every marine
he ever served with.

537
00:46:49,257 --> 00:46:51,157
My guess is
this has happened before.

538
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,420
We have to be careful here.

539
00:46:53,494 --> 00:46:55,724
This guy is
the warrior's warrior.

540
00:46:55,797 --> 00:47:01,360
A Navy Cross, two Silver Stars
for composure in battle.

541
00:47:01,436 --> 00:47:04,462
He has no wife, no kids,
just the Corps.

542
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:08,873
He was our best.
Thats why he was sent.

543
00:47:08,943 --> 00:47:11,138
He's not on trial for the
good service he gave the country,

544
00:47:11,212 --> 00:47:13,680
<i>but for what he did</i>
<i>on the wall in Yemen, period.</i>

545
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,648
Major, nobody wants to say it,

546
00:47:15,717 --> 00:47:18,709
but it occurs to me we're trying
to set an example here.

547
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:21,653
So lets set it and show
the world we mean business.

548
00:47:21,723 --> 00:47:26,126
The first charge supports the death
penalty, and I say we go for it.

549
00:47:26,194 --> 00:47:27,991
No more death.

550
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:30,758
I'll see that he never gets another
command and I'll put him in jail,

551
00:47:30,832 --> 00:47:34,461
but I will not seek death for a man
who served his country honorably.

552
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:36,799
<i>I don't want it</i>
<i>brought up again.</i>

553
00:47:36,871 --> 00:47:40,068
We gotta show
Childers' state of mind.

554
00:47:40,141 --> 00:47:42,166
We gotta prove he went out
with intent to kill,

555
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:44,473
and that is not going to be easy.

556
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:47,173
Whether a man is charged
with murder or hailed as a hero...

557
00:47:47,248 --> 00:47:49,910
is sometimes a very thin line.

558
00:47:49,984 --> 00:47:54,114
Our case is this: Childers receives
orders that a regularly scheduled,

559
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:57,851
lawful protest outside
our embassy in Yemen is unruly.

560
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:00,792
He is to secure
or evacuate the premises.

561
00:48:00,862 --> 00:48:03,626
There has been no violence
prior to his arrival.

562
00:48:03,698 --> 00:48:05,131
Once there, Ambassador Mourain...

563
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:07,861
does not feel the situation
warrants evacuation.

564
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,301
- Childers ignores him.
- <i>There was sniper fire.</i>

565
00:48:10,371 --> 00:48:13,397
They draw fire from snipers
across the street.

566
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:17,001
Childers retaliates into an unarmed
crowd in front of the embassy.

567
00:48:17,078 --> 00:48:21,037
A crowd of women and children.
He shot the wrong people.

You have to understand the kind of
pressure Childers has been under.

No, no thanks.

You're aware, Colonel,
we could ask for the death penalty.

You're not serious.

Oh, I'm very serious.
In fact, its been suggested.

What do you think would happen
if a Yemeni killed 83 Americans?

600
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,197
He'd have a trial
that would last for one day,

601
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:22,531
and they'd take off his head.

602
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,537
Have a seat, Colonel.

603
00:50:25,973 --> 00:50:27,907
Please.

604
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:35,548
So here it is:
You plead him out. Guilty.

605
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,311
He throws himself at the mercy.

606
00:50:37,385 --> 00:50:40,218
- We'll help him out at sentencing.
- How much help?

607
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:42,813
I'm not about to promise you
anything, but I'd say...

608
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,882
in the neighborhood of ten
to fifteen, out in seven.

609
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,086
Major,

610
00:50:47,161 --> 00:50:50,153
do you know what the life expectancy
was for a second lieutenant...

611
00:50:50,231 --> 00:50:53,496
dropped into a combat zone
in Vietnam in 1968?

612
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:56,002
I don't have time
for 20 questions, sir.

613
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,732
Then whats all this shit about
the odds of winning at blackjack?

614
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:03,641
You got time.
Take a guess.

615
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:07,010
My guess is your man's going down
'cause he deserves to go down.

616
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:13,420
I got a question for you, Colonel.
What happened at Ca Lu?

617
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,923
<i>The battle of Ca Lu,</i>
<i>Vietnam.</i>

618
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:20,290
You were there with Childers.
Something happened. What was it?

619
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:24,127
Fuck you is what happened
at Ca Lu, Biggs.

620
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,133
Two weeks.

621
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,634
Life expectancy of
a second lieutenant...

622
00:51:28,703 --> 00:51:31,194
in combat in Vietnam
was two weeks.

623
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:32,705
Sir, I need more time
to prepare this case.

624
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:34,968
I need your permission
to go to Yemen...

625
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:38,637
Its all here, Hodge. We did an
exhaustive Article 32 investigation.

626
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:41,273
This thing happened
3,000 miles away. I need more time.

627
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:43,044
Colonel, its all here.

628
00:51:43,117 --> 00:51:45,278
We had it brought from Yemen,
and its not unusual to convene...

629
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:47,287
a court-martial
on short notice.

630
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:50,984
There could be witnesses, something
the investigators overlooked, sir.

631
00:51:51,058 --> 00:51:53,993
Don't you think Colonel Childers
is entitled all consideration?

632
00:51:54,061 --> 00:51:57,963
<i>Colonel Hodges, I don't care</i>
<i>if you go to China.</i>

633
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,966
We have our marching orders,
and this court-martial...

634
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,934
will convene
at 0900 a week Monday.

635
00:52:02,003 --> 00:52:05,097
- Now, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

I know. Believe me, I know.

[Sighs] Can I leave you alone
with that thing in the house?

651
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,926
Yeah. I ain't goin' six
on you, Hodge.

652
00:53:32,993 --> 00:53:33,925
I'm goin' to Yemen.

653
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:36,292
If I have to stick your ass
in a hospital till I get back,

654
00:53:36,364 --> 00:53:40,425
- that is what I will do.
- You don't have to do that.

[Sighs]
Oh, shit.

657
00:53:45,706 --> 00:53:48,368
They take my uniform away,
they may as well shoot me.

658

You can live with it, bud.
Believe me.

I'm not gonna shit you.
They offered us a deal.

[Sighs] You plead guilty, its
ten to fifteen. You're out in seven.

661
00:54:01,422 --> 00:54:05,290
- What do you think?
- I think they're out to crucify you.

662

For a whole lot of reasons,

If I'm guilty of this,

in combat for the last 30 years.

Captain Hustings.

I'm not in uniform and I'm not
saluting because of the snipers.

My mother prefers to
think of me as glib, sir.

Very well then. You will most glibly
belay all bullshit and drive on.

at the scene, as you requested, sir.
