2
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:32,197
...what has turned into
a classic Formula 1 season.

3
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,069
...with the weather conditions
so uncertain,

4
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,571
the drivers prepare for...

5
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,741
...the track is still
dangerously wet,

6
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,844
but following a drivers meeting,
a decision has been taken.

7
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,848
Three minutes to go.
Everybody off the grid now.

8
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,865
25 drivers start every season
in Formula 1,

9
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,469
and each year, two of us die.

10
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,706
What kind of person
does a job like this?

11
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,242
Not normal men, for sure.

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,644
Rebels,

13
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:19,812
lunatics,

14
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,447
dreamers.

15
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,616
People who are desperate
to make a mark

16
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,019
and are prepared to die trying.

17
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,656
My name is Niki Lauda,

18
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,659
and racing people know me
for two things.

19
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:37,129
The first is
my rivalry with him.

20
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,099
Mass is going on slicks.

21
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,639
What about Hunt?
Has he changed?

22
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,174
No, he's going on wets.

23
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,977
I don't know why
it became such a big thing.

24
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,948
We were just drivers
busting each other's balls.

25
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,884
To me this is perfectly normal,

26
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,120
but other people
saw it differently,

27
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,723
that whatever it was between us
went deeper.

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,708
The other thing
I'm remembered for

29
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,378
is what happened
on 1 st August 1976,

30
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,548
when I was chasing him
like an asshole.

31
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,812
Yeah, that's the one.
On the second shelf. Thank you.

32
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,047
Trauma trolley, please.

33
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,750
I think the racetrack telephoned
ahead that I was coming.

34
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,685
Hunt. James Hunt.

35
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,626
What's the matter? No one ever
seen a spot of blood before?

36
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,496
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

37
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,568
We all thought you'd been
in an accident.

38
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,602
I have.

39
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,370
If you call a friendly
disagreement

40
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,773
with another driver
an accident.

41
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,913
What did you disagree about?

42
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,882
It's none of your business.

43
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,884
Sorry.

44
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,752
His wife.

45
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,656
That's going to need
a couple of stitches.

46
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,959
- It's a nasty cut.
- It was a nasty blow.

47
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,161
Done with a bloody crowbar.

48
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,698
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

49
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,467
Only what she asked me to do.

50
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,870
Which was?

51
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,474
I'd be happy to show you
if you like.

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,779
Sorry.

53
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,083
I have a theory
why women like racing drivers.

54
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,353
It's not because they respect
what we do,

55
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,855
driving round and round
in circles.

56
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,824
Mostly they think
that's pathetic

57
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,859
and they're probably right.

58
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,462
It's our closeness to death.

59
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:27,399
The closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.

60
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,003
The more alive you are.
And they can see that in you.

61
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,105
They feel that in you.

62
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,941
My name is James Hunt.

63
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,076
My father is a stockbroker,

64
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,178
my sister is a barrister

65
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,781
and my brother is an accountant.

66
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,149
And I,

67
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,218
well, I do this.

68
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,857
It's a wonderful way to live.
It's the only way to drive.

69
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,460
As if each day is your last.

70
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,972
I've never been
to a Grand Prix before.

71
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,640
You still haven't.

72
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,643
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

73
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,379
That's a lower division,

74
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,149
where idiots like me
mess about

75
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,519
in the hop of being
talent-spotted to race in F1.

76
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,688
- You look disappointed.
- No.

77
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,857
You only slept with me because
you thought I was famous.

78
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,659
That's not true!

79
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,362
Don't worry. I will be one day.

80
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,763
Morning, everyone.

81
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,832
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

82
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,035
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsely,
team manager.

83
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,570
How do you do?

84
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,105
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

85
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,407
Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.

86
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,775
How do you do?

87
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,512
And Alexander, Lord Hesketh,
the team's owner.

88
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,449
How do you do?

89
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,150
Fine, thanks.

90
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,453
Well done, Superstar!

91
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,755
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

92
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,256
Lotus 59.

93
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,360
1000cc. Cosworth MAE engine.

94
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,663
She's no beauty,
but goes like the clappers.

95
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,004
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

96
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,640
Good sign, actually.
Means he's stoked.

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,343
All Formula 3 cars
to the assembly area.

98
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,845
Now, please.

99
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,992
...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.

100
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,428
All right, Superstar?

101
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,996
Never better, patron.

102
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,565
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

103
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,503
Quick toke of this.

104
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,806
At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,

105
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,376
with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him

106
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,112
and Dave Walker
completing Row 1.

107
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,048
Row 2 is Mike Beuttler
and Dave Morgan,

108
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,817
with Tony Trimmer
and Gerry Birrell.

109
00:06:59,051 --> 00:06:59,951
Who's that?

110
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,119
He's new.

111
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,656
- Some German.
- Austrian.

112
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,826
He's been here since 5 a.m.
Walking the track.

113
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,562
You might actually have
to concentrate today, James.

114
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,397
You'll need these.

115
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,733
Okay, start her up.

116
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,502
Ah! What music!

117
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,671
They could never
have imagined it,

118
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,107
those pioneers
who invented the automobile,

119
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,075
that it would
possess us like this,

120
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,645
in our imaginations, our dreams.

121
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,147
Nursie, men love women,

122
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,116
but even more than that,

123
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,819
men love cars!

124
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,930
- Come on, James!
- It's James! Go on, James!

125
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,165
Go, James!

126
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,941
Hunt's still in the lead,

127
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,743
but Niki Lauda
is right on his tail!

128
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,955
Hunt and Lauda are proving
to be in a class of their own.

129
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,090
They're leaving the pack
far behind.

130
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,759
Herr Red Devil's on his tail.

131
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,967
Lauda takes a look down
the inside...

132
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,737
...and he's sold him a dummy!

133
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,042
Lauda is through!
He's in the lead!

134
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,613
Hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake.

135
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,087
Hunt's in Laudaxs slipstream.

136
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,789
Lauda's not leaving any gap.

137
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,029
The Lotus goes for the inside.

138
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,431
It's an aggressive move
from Hunt.

139
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,404
There's contact!

140
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,681
The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!

141
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,050
The back marker's gone through!

142
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,653
You can see why Hunter's
fellow drivers call him

143
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,488
"Hunt the Shunt."

144
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,825
Asshole!

145
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,761
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it!

146
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,696
Lauda is clearly furious.

147
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,899
There's every reason to expect
sharp words in the pit.

148
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,135
It's going to be victory
for Hunt.

149
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,738
It's going to be an ignominious
defeat for Niki Lauda.

150
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,479
So James Hunt scores
his third major Formula 3 win

151
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,615
of the season here,
at Crystal Palace,

152
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,451
after a desperate battle
with Niki Lauda.

153
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,453
Lauda was unable so restart

154
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,356
after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out

155
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,658
in the last lap of the race.

156
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,493
Hard luck.
Better luck next time.

157
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,728
Hey, asshole!

158
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,799
That was my line.
I had that corner.

159
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,567
You mean the one
that you spun out of

160
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,402
and finished facing
the other way?

161
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,171
I think that corner had you.

162
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,907
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

163
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,643
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

164
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,980
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

165
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,249
Fuck you!
What's your name?

166
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,920
James Simon Wallis Hunt.

167
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,456
Remember it,
my little Jerry friend.

168
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,559
- Jawohl! Remember ze name.
- It's very simple.

169
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,894
Hunt, it rhymes with cunt!

170
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,264
A word that happens
to describe you perfectly.

171
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,766
Who was that?

172
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,169
I've no idea.
He looks like a rat, doesn't he?

173
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,139
In my hometown, Vienna,

174
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,441
my family's famous
for one thing:

175
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,676
Business.

176
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,579
My grandfather
was a businessman,

177
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,247
my father, too.

178
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:53,051
So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,

179
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,053
they had a few things to say.

180
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,254
Never!

181
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:20,879
Good.

182
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,436
So if my family
wasn't going to help me,

183
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,972
I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.

184
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,909
I found a Formula 1 team
with an OK car

185
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,211
and an owner who had run
out of money

186
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,547
and was willing to accept
my terms.

187
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,582
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

188
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,384
I'm delighted to say...

189
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,053
that the winner of the
Guild of Motoring Writers Award

190
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,355
Driver of the Year...

191
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,857
is James Hunt.

192
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,595
Superb news!

193
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,631
- Well done, James.
- Superstar!

194
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,999
Fantastic!

195
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,437
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

196
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,572
Yes!

197
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,975
My parents always wanted me
to be a doctor

198
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,112
or a stockbroker or something.
They gave me

199
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,381
the first-class education,
but that went all terribly wrong

200
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,917
and I ended up with you lot.

201
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,989
Thank you. I need it more
than you do.

202
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,025
I mean, I have a hot head,

203
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,094
an inability
to tolerate discipline...

204
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,796
- Yes!
- Very true!

205
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,398
I fall out with people
left and right.

206
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,400
The only creatures
I've ever really loved

207
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,003
or treated honorably
are budgerigars.

208
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,641
So in any normal area of life,
I'd be, or I am,

209
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,143
a total liability.

210
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,612
The only thing I've got going
for me is I'm quick in a car.

211
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,747
So thank you for this
and for acknowledging that.

212
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,616
I'm going to give it
to my father

213
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,084
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece

214
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,120
and imagine it's a first-class
degree in medicine.

215
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,436
Well done, Superstar.

216
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,771
Another season like that,

217
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,173
I'll move you up
to the big time.

218
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,941
Come on, you don't think
I'm ready now?

219
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,176
You are.

220
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,511
I'm not. I've got
to find you a car first.

221
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,113
Well, go on, then.

222
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,815
Chop chop. Don't wait too long.

223
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,516
You don't want him to do
what Lauda just did.

224
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,452
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive, with BRM.

225
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,555
How the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

226
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,923
He's never won a bloody thing.

227
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,025
Apparently, took out a loan
and bought his way in

228
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,893
with two million
Austrian shillings.

229
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,161
Jesus.

230
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,515
Niki Lauda.

231
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,184
Here for pre-season testing.
BRM?

232
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,455
Sign the release form.
I'll let them know you're here.

233
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,435
- Mr. Stanley.
- Good morning.

234
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,470
- Good morning.
- Clay!

235
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,040
Let me introduce you
to our number one driver.

236
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,909
Clay Regazzoni.

237
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,512
- How are you?
- Good.

238
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,881
Pleasure.

239
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,450
And these are your mechanics.

240
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,086
They're reporting
exclusively to you,

241
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,921
as per contract.

242
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,022
Pleasure.

243
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,558
- Do you wanna see the car?
- Sure.

244
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,261
Hello.

245
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,102
There she is. P160.

246
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,406
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

247
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,408
How much does she weigh?

248
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,977
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

249
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,680
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

250
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,750
That lump weighs
190K on its own.

251
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:19,817
Okay.

252
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,388
What horsepower are you getting?

253
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,990
- No, no, 450.
- It's not enough.

254
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,425
It needs to be 500.

255
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,060
And the engine needs to be

256
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,895
- We already tried.
- Tried what?

257
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,896
Everything.

258
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,398
We replaced the entire
exhaust system.

259
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,101
- Barely made the difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

260
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,149
Now the engine block.

261
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,085
Any mounting or fixing plates,
strip it out also.

262
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,520
When you've done that,

263
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,455
we have to look
at the aerodynamics,

264
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,257
front and rear wing.

265
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,810
Okay, thank you.
Good night.

266
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,099
What was Regazzoni's time?

267
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,601
1:53.

268
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,904
Okay, now put him in my car
and he'll go 2 seconds faster.

269
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,974
- Well, that's impossible.
- No chance.

270
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,013
We've been working on it
all night.

271
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,482
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

272
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:58,950
I don't understand.
Why am I supposed to do this?

273
00:16:59,184 --> 00:16:59,951
I don't know, Clay.

274
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,553
He wants you
to take it for a spin.

275
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,956
Gloves, please.

276
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,438
- I'd say we push it...
- All right.

277
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,706
What did you do to the car?

278
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,542
That's information
I'll share with you

279
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,510
under certain conditions only.

280
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,645
Go on.

281
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,781
A guaranteed place in the team.

282
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,483
And a paid contract
on equal terms

283
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,785
with Regazzoni for two years.

284
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,320
Are you crazy?

285
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,689
Clay's a senior figure in F1.

286
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,357
You're just a rookie!

287
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,027
The only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

288
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,396
Well, as of now,
if you want me to stay,

289
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,898
we rip up the contract,
I don't pay you a cent.

290
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,733
That's outrageous!

291
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,103
Was he quicker in my car?

292
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,538
He was, wasn't he?

293
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,641
Did he go two seconds faster?

294
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,413
Two point three.

295
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,585
So, have a think,

296
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,821
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

297
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,170
Hey, Niki.

298
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,009
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

299
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,077
What?

300
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,848
If it's the track manager you're
taking on your date tonight.

301
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,451
It's none of your business.

302
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,686
Okay, but if you want my advice,

303
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,588
I'd let this one go.

304
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,726
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

305
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,830
Agnes's last boyfriend

306
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,999
was a British Formula 2 driver

307
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,401
who has a reputation
for two things,

308
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,970
for being a little crazy
on the track...

309
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,706
and for going all night
and all day

310
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,409
and all night again in bed.
He's a good driver,

311
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,778
but an immortal fuck apparently.

312
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,713
I don't know about you,
but that's not an act

313
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,849
I'd like to follow.

314
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,620
But if that
doesn't bother you...

315
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,724
What's his name, the driver?

316
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,427
Hunt. James Hunt.

317
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,400
You see, you share information

318
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,502
and I share information.

319
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,138
That's what teammates are for.

320
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,818
- Where the hell are we going?
- I promise it'll be worth it.

321
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,853
Just keep them closed.

322
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,624
Wait for it.

323
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,462
There.

324
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,830
What do you say?

325
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,732
She's Formula 1.

326
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,134
Yes, she is, Superstar.

327
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,071
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

328
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,139
And since the economics
of F1 are not

329
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,842
so significantly different
to the economics of F2,

330
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,745
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

331
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,881
we might as well be doing it
on the big roulette table in F1.

332
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,252
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

333
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,093
Actually, credit where it's due,
we got the idea from Niki.

334
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,694
- Who?
- Lauda.

335
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,097
Bought his way in
rather than mess about

336
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,498
in the lower divisions.
I thought:

337
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,799
"Bloody hell, he's right."

338
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,701
No sponsorship, Superstar.

339
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,069
I hope you approve.

340
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,906
No vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms.

341
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,609
Just plain white with the flags.

342
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,778
And racing overalls

343
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:22,913
which read:

344
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,183
"Sex. Breakfast of champions."

345
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,154
So when do we start?

346
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,824
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

347
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,594
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

348
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,830
VILLAGE OF
WATKINS GLEN

349
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,674
When the season started,
people wondered

350
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,542
whether Lord Hesketh
and his team

351
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,944
of upper-class enthusiasts
were bringing glamour

352
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,847
to the racing community
or just comedy.

353
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,483
Certainly it was the first time
anyone had seen

354
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,720
a butler serving oysters
and caviar in the pits.

355
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,790
But they have made
quite an impact.

356
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,393
6th in France, 4th in Britain
and 3rd in Holland.

357
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,530
All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.

358
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,066
A severe crash at the Esses.

359
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,501
Red flag.
There's a car off the track.

360
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,503
And reports are reaching me
that there's been

361
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,739
a serious accident
in qualifying.

362
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,941
The identity of the driver
we don't currently have,

363
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,811
but as you can tell from
all the activity going on

364
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,548
towards the track, it was
clearly a grave incident indeed.

365
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,117
We will, of course, have
more information as we get it,

366
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,687
but it is the sight and sound
of F1 nobody likes to see.

367
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,694
- Get your hands off me!
- Hey, come on!

368
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:56,474
Drivers of top stature we've
lost just in the past 4 seasons

369
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,776
have included Piers Courage,

370
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,144
Jochen Rindt,

371
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,213
Jo Siffert,

372
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,515
Roger Williamson

373
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,650
and today, at Watkins Glen,

374
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,653
Formula 1 has claimed
another driver.

375
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,590
The Tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race.

376
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,892
Their places on the grid
will be left empty.

377
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,561
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

378
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:18,662
Why?

379
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,066
He made a mistake,
went into the corner too fast.

380
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,434
It's his fault.

381
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,669
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

382
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,738
Look at the tyre marks.

383
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,075
So says the nobody, who had
to pay for his own drive.

384
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,010
How's that working out for you,
by the way?

385
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,211
Fine.

386
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,547
How is it at the back?

387
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,116
Not planning
on being there for long.

388
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,753
Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.
Ten minutes.

389
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:43,854
Asshole.

390
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,258
Arsehole.

391
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:52,196
Heading into the Grand Hotel
hairpin, second gear.

392
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,199
Turn in hard,
looking for late apex,

393
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,967
gentle with the bar.

394
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,004
Heading into Portier,
second gear,

395
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,338
clip the apex,

396
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,073
light brake, stay in second,

397
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,975
looking for a good exit.

398
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,911
Heading through the tunnel,
gradual right,

399
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,880
up through third,
fourth, fifth...

400
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,816
Is Alexander around?

401
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,585
Yes, he was.

402
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,021
He went back to the house
to take a call.

403
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,722
He'll be back shortly.

404
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,725
He only wanted to show me
his pride and joy.

405
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,428
Rhymes with 'boy'
if you ask me.

406
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,796
And 'toy.'

407
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,132
God, it's so flimsy.

408
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,734
For something
that costs so much.

409
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,538
There's no comfort,
no protection, nothing.

410
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,475
No, it's just
a little coffin, really.

411
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,478
Surrounded by
high-octane fuel in here.

412
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,481
Being driven round 170 mph.

413
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,117
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

414
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,954
You're James, aren't you?

415
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,256
Yes.

416
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,626
You fit the description.

417
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,228
Is that right?

418
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,431
Suzy. Friend ofAlex's.

419
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,732
Yeah, yeah.

420
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,801
I know exactly.

421
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,971
What was the description?

422
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,639
Mostly positive in terms
of appearance.

423
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,841
Negative only in terms
of character.

424
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,410
I've been told to avoid you.

425
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,812
By whom?

426
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,614
Alexander.

427
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,649
He says you're a bad boy.

428
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,751
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

429
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,820
I was. I'm not anymore.

430
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,889
The new me is very professional.

431
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,624
Early to bed, early to rise.

432
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,058
All very dull,

433
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,793
but according to the team,

434
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,930
'the best way to keep
beating the goose stepper.'

435
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,865
Is that what you were doing
when I came in?

436
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,801
Yes, visualization techniques,
memorising the circuit,

437
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,638
in this case Monaco,
which is up next.

438
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,845
Personally I've always been
a great believer

439
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,780
in getting there on the day,
putting my foot down

440
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,116
and playing chicken
with everyone else.

441
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,085
But they don't want me
doing that anymore.

442
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,822
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

443
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,059
And what about your soul,
your heart?

444
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,562
They've got ideas
about that, too.

445
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,031
They want me to stop
messing around,

446
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,367
settle down, get married
with the next nice girl I meet.

447
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,570
They think
that'd be good for me.

448
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,071
What do you think?

449
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,206
It sounds fucking awful.

450
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,111
But sine they're right
about most things,

451
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,681
they're probably right
about that too.

452
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,917
You don't fancy
getting married, do you?

453
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,943
Suzy.

454
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,512
JUST MARRIED

455
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,982
Hey, hey, hey!

456
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,621
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

457
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,623
Didn't want to ruin your day.

458
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:06,857
It's...

459
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,627
- it's the Kraut.
- What about him?

460
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,730
He's just been signed
by Ferrari.

461
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,698
You're kidding me?

462
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,767
Jesus. How did that happen?

463
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,569
Did he buy his way in there too?

464
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,438
Well, the old man took
Regazzoni back

465
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,641
and he insisted on it
apparently.

466
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,944
He says that Niki's a genius
setting up the cars.

467
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,598
It's terrible.
Drives like a pig.

468
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,501
- You can't say that.
- Why not?

469
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,003
- It's a Ferrari!
- It's a shitbox!

470
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,039
It understeers like crazy
and the weight distribution

471
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,507
is a disaster.

472
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,908
It's amazing,
all these facilities

473
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,444
and you make a piece of crap
like this.

474
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,543
"Ferrari family,"

475
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,344
"our good friend
Clay Regazzoni."

476
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,680
You are family and friend
to the commendatore

477
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,015
as long as you win.

478
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,616
The minute you don't,
ciao, ciao.

479
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,118
I totally understand.

480
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,519
It's business.

481
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:43,921
I would do the same.

482
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,123
But it isn't
just business, is it?

483
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,759
What we do.
It's passion, love.

484
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,729
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

485
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:52,763
Not me.

486
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,932
If I had more talent
and could earn better money

487
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,401
with something else,
I would.

488
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,403
How do you know you will
make money here?

489
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,071
You haven't yet.

490
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,373
Not yet, but I will.

491
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,543
If you can, I can.

492
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,716
You know, are you ever
not an asshole?

493
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,952
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

494
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,522
By now I'm both quicker than you
and better at setting up a car.

495
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,791
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

496
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,159
Screw you.

497
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,834
I brought you along today

498
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,870
because you seem
like a lonely kind of guy.

499
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,038
I thought if I introduced you
to some nice people,

500
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,740
that could rub off on you.

501
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:37,908
Forget it.

502
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,543
Make your own friends.

503
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,978
Come on, Clay.

504
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,479
I'm sorry.

505
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,650
Are you leaving?

506
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,485
Yes.

507
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,887
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

508
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,523
anywhere with a train station?

509
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:27,891
Sure.

510
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,727
Trento's half an hour's drive.

511
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:31,862
Get in.

512
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,457
What are you doing?

513
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,526
You hear that noise
when you accelerate?

514
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,795
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

515
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,129
My what?

516
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:09,066
And when you brake,
your foot goes all the way down,

517
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,901
which means there's air
in the system.

518
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,170
- Anything else?
- No.

519
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,840
Apart from the rear brakes
are worn out,

520
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,009
the front right tyre
is a bit soft,

521
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,712
which explains why
you're weaving so much.

522
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,647
How can you tell?

523
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,515
- My ass.
- Sorry?

524
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,718
God gave me an OK mind,

525
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,754
but a really good ass which
can feel everything in a car.

526
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,389
You don't know what
you're talking about.

527
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,858
This car is fine.
I just had a service a week ago.

528
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:35,926
Not a good one.

529
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,795
Yes, a very good one,
very expensive.

530
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,465
This car's as good as new.
Relax.

531
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,974
- You're not in a hurry, are you?
- No.

532
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,844
As long as I'm back
in Maranello Monday morning.

533
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,548
- Marlene.
- Niki.

534
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,520
Yes.

535
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,635
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

536
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,571
On one condition, though.

537
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,606
It's a piece of shit.
It's dog shit.

538
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,709
But if you drive it,
you make my life, Niki, eh?

539
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,928
Would someone please
tell me what's going on?

540
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,965
- Who are you? Should I know you?
- What, you don't know?

541
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,834
He's Niki Lauda,
Formula 1 driver,

542
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,669
and he just signed with Ferrari.

543
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,004
- Him?
- Yes.

544
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,006
- Impossible.
- Why?

545
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,509
Well, you know,
Formula 1 drivers,

546
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,711
they have long hair,
are sexy...

547
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,646
their shirts are open to here.

548
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,348
- Thank you.
- Yes.

549
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,785
Anyway, look at the way
he's driving, like an old man.

550
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,824
There's no need to drive fast.

551
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,527
It just increases
the percentage of risk.

552
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,695
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

553
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,465
Right now,
with zero incentive or reward,

554
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,567
why would I drive fast?

555
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,538
Because I'm asking you to.

556
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,813
Usually.

557
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,937
This is an incredible battle
between Niki Lauda

558
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,373
in the red Ferrari
and James Hunt

559
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,442
in the white Hesketh.

560
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,844
...the challenge
of Niki Lauda...

561
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,881
Lauda attacking Hunt.
He gets through on the inside.

562
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,682
Goes wide at the exit.

563
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,151
Hunt is past again.

564
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:57,420
Once more, Lauda tries
to sneak up the inside.

565
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,790
They're absolutely side by side,
wheel to wheel.

566
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,759
So evenly matched.

567
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,629
Fantastic battle between
these two great drivers.

568
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,964
Hunt is now ahead once more.

569
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,001
But Lauda's coming back
again now.

570
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,870
Lauda once more
sneaks up the inside.

571
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,873
And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...

572
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,177
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just one second.

573
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,413
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

574
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,883
We're in the closing laps
of this race at Watkins Glen.

575
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,852
They come down the hill.

576
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,421
And Hunt's got a problem!

577
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,890
Hunt pulls across to the left!

578
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,826
Lauda goes ahead on his own.

579
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,730
A sad end to a wonderful battle.

580
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,533
Hunt pushing off the marshal.

581
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,544
The chequered flag
is waiting for Lauda

582
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,079
and for Ferrari!

583
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,383
The title going to Niki Lauda,

584
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:01,785
who wins the race,

585
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,121
who wins the World Championship.

586
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,698
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

587
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,900
Marlene.

588
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,471
With a car like that,
the rest of us

589
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,606
never stood a chance, did we?

590
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,609
Maybe the car being so good
has something to do with me.

591
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,378
Come on, Niki.
You're in a Ferrari.

592
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,646
I'm in a Hesketh.

593
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,481
Equal terms,
the way it was in Formula 3,

594
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,850
- Id' beat you and you know it.
- Never.

595
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,019
You might win one race,
maybe two,

596
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,453
because you're aggressive.

597
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,389
But in the long run,
over the course of a season,

598
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,523
no chance.

599
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:14,791
Right. Why is that?

600
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,459
Because to be a champion,

601
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,761
it takes more
than just being quick.

602
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,396
It's the whole picture.

603
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,665
You're just a charger
and a party guy.

604
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,366
That's why everybody likes you.

605
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,403
Try saying that
and tell me you're not jealous.

606
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,372
Why would I be jealous?
Think about it.

607
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,675
All that affection,
all those smiles,

608
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,643
is a sign of disrespect.

609
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,379
They don't fear you.
Whereas compared that to me.

610
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,782
Yes, compared to you,
whom no one likes.

611
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,617
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

612
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,453
Right.
Because I'm a serious guy.

613
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,122
I go to bed early, I look after
myself, after my car.

614
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,125
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

615
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,760
And then, after the race,
I go home

616
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,362
instead of going to bars

617
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,131
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

618
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,633
Arseholes?

619
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,502
You should go home
more often too.

620
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,708
I heard you got married.

621
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,510
Yes, I did.

622
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,948
So where is she,
this mysterious wife?

623
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,451
In New York, working.

624
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,455
You know, I've never
seen you with her once.

625
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,756
No?

626
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,627
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

627
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,796
on your own,
looking after yourself,

628
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,898
being a good little boy.

629
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,038
Take a drink on me, James.

630
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,908
Thank you, Niki.
I might just have two.

631
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,087
Right, Bubbles,

632
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,757
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year,

633
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,024
just say it,

634
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,793
you're word is my command.

635
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,095
There are no lengths
to which I will not go.

636
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,830
And I mean it.

637
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,801
What the hell's going on?

638
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,438
Where is everybody?

639
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,073
What's the matter?

640
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,046
Do you know
what the date it is today?

641
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,916
Yes. It's November,
the 14th. Why?

642
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,887
Do you have any idea of
the significance of that date?

643
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:29,092
I don't know.
Time to start killing pheasants?

644
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,164
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

645
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,866
for the forthcoming
Formula 1 season.

646
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:37,867
Yes?

647
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,936
Which elapsed
at midnight last night

648
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,405
- and we didn't attract any.
- Well, so?

649
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,707
We aren't looking
for sponsorship.

650
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,645
Like you said, condoms
an cigarettes, vulgar, right?

651
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:49,946
Right.

652
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,150
Except we are, or were.

653
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:00,156
I've made something
of a miscalculation.

654
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,693
The economics,
Formula 1, realities thereof.

655
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,731
It turns out not like
the lower divisions at all.

656
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,569
What are you saying?

657
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,173
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

658
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,811
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

659
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,582
Probably have
to sell this place.

660
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:27,817
Oh, Christ.

661
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,795
I need a drive, Pete.
I need you to find me a drive.

662
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,164
I mean, what about Lotus?

663
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,367
You don't wanna know.

664
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,636
- Actually, I do.
- Okay.

665
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,707
They felt your reputation
preceded you.

666
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,743
And what does that mean?

667
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,214
It's my other line.
Look, I'll get back to you.

668
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,551
Peter Hunt.

669
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,618
Fuck!

670
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,732
Don't worry.
Something will turn up.

671
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,709
Doubt that will help
in the meantime.

672
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,581
Why don't we go away
at the weekend?

673
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:05,815
Skiing.

674
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,651
Before I go back to New York.

675
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,524
Talk to me, James.
Don't make a stranger of me.

676
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,194
You know, Suzy, only a stranger
would invite me skiing

677
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:22,532
when they know
I haven't got a fucking drive!

678
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,806
I can't watch this.

679
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,076
What were you hoping for anyway?

680
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,678
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

681
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:37,513
No danger of that.

682
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,916
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

683
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,884
Don't go to men who are willing
to kill themselves

684
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,187
driving in circles
looking for normality.

685
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,855
I never expected normality.

686
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,890
God knows I walked into this
with my eyes open.

687
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,593
I just hoped I'd married someone
who is half as impressive

688
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,629
on the inside
as he is on the outside!

689
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,664
At least there's something
behind the facade.

690
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,734
- James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

691
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,036
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

692
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,072
that needs your vapid mush
to flog it.

693
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,143
- Hello?
- Hi, James.

694
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,446
It's Peter.
Something's up at McLaren.

695
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,382
- What have you heard?
- Nothing. Why?

696
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:49,385
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

697
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,521
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

698
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,923
Say anything, just get me
in that room.

699
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,863
I'll come straight to the point.

700
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,900
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

701
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,536
Has ditched us for another team
at the last minute.

702
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,805
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

703
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,973
ASA-fucking-P.

704
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,377
Fortunately a few hands
have already gone up,

705
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:15,712
good people.

706
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:18,748
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

707
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,784
But he's consistent, dependable.

708
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,052
A grown-up.

709
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,522
Right, and will he go for
that gap when no one else will?

710
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,358
Will he put his life on the line
the day it really matters?

711
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:30,927
The sponsors like him.

712
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,029
What do you want,
a driver or a brush salesman?

713
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:35,098
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

714
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,632
But that means beating
Niki Lauda,

715
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,434
not being a show pony
for sponsors.

716
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,103
I heard about this thing
with Niki.

717
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,671
Everyone has.

718
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,639
You really thing
you can beat him?

719
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:44,941
I'd beat him in a McLaren.

720
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,977
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

721
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,680
Which is why I'm here, begging.

722
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,115
I'll do whatever you ask.

723
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,383
I'll put on a tie,
I'll smile for sponsors,

724
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,385
say the right things.

725
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,921
I can beat this guy, trust me.

726
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,824
Just give me the drive.

727
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,060
Yeah, he can be a loose canon.

728
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,462
And, yeah,
he will drive you all mad,

729
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,599
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff,

730
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,868
there is no better driver
in the world.

731
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,103
He's the real thing, Teddy.

732
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:16,706
He's what we all
came into this for.

733
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,008
Nine days out of ten
you'll be pulling your hair out,

734
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:22,078
but on that tenth day
James will be unbeatable.

735
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,680
That is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

736
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,517
You'll never win the
championship with Jacky Ickx.

737
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,419
You just might with James.

738
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:39,962
GRANDE PREMIO DO BRAZIL
INTERLAGOS

739
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,131
JANUARY 1976

740
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,911
Welcome to So Paulo, Brazil,
and the Interlagos circuit

741
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,181
for the first race in the 1976
Formula 1 season,

742
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,517
where the main news is
James Hunt qualified fastest,

743
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,986
beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari
to pole position

744
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,823
by just 200th of a second.

745
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,492
New car.

746
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,061
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

747
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,063
I noticed that too.

748
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,833
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

749
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:17,834
Yeah.

750
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,069
Let's see where we are
after lap one.

751
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,939
Let's see where we are
in five races time.

752
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,042
Hunt has the pit lane
pole position,

753
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:27,677
which should give him
the best chance

754
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,846
of outdragging Lauda's Ferrari.

755
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,681
If ever there was a doubt about

756
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,750
whether Lauda had a serious
challenger to this season,

757
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,154
Hunt and his McLaren have
certainly given us the answer.

758
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,764
BRAZIL
LAUDA WINS

759
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,900
HUNT HAS ENGINE FAILURE

760
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,503
GRAND PRIX
SOUTH AFRICA 76

761
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:57,006
Here in South Africa,
James Hunt is determined

762
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,643
to make amends after that
disastrous retirement in Brazil.

763
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,314
But it's Lauda who takes
the flag here at Kyalami.

764
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,350
James Hunt comes home second

765
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,785
to confirm his championship
challenge at last

766
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,922
and score his first points
of the season.

767
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,393
That wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck.

768
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,528
Next time I'll have you.

769
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,398
We'll see in Spain.

770
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,884
SPAIN -HUNT WINS
LAUDA 2ND

771
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,988
James Hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season

772
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,824
here in Spain,
after a brilliant drive.

773
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,494
It was only a matter of time.

774
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,613
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

775
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,082
- What?
- You're disqualified.

776
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:14,984
How can we be disqualified?

777
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,420
- 1.5 cm.
- It's the same car.

778
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,030
...McLaren M23 has proved
very controversial here.

779
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,467
Just make it narrower.
I don't care how.

780
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,502
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

781
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,372
I wanna make sure this thing
is legal, no doubts.

782
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,108
Then we'd better move the
oil coolers to the old position.

783
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,644
- The wing brackets need...
- Fuck.

784
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,413
What the fuck
d'you think we're doing?

785
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,719
GRAND PRIX
MONACO 76

786
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,625
And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,

787
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,462
his championship here
is not going well.

788
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,931
And now it's all gone wrong
here at Monaco!

789
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,933
His engine is smoking!

790
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,838
Smoke pouring from the engine
of that McLaren!

791
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,606
And James Hunt is out!

792
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,941
Can you tell us what happened?

793
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,876
Sure. It's magic,
we've taken a great car,

794
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,778
a great piece of engineering
and overnight turned it

795
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,481
into a big, huge stinking turd.

796
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:21,450
BELGIUM
MAY 1976

797
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,627
Shit!

798
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,466
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil!

799
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,168
It's fucking undriveable!

800
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,737
If there's a problem
with the car, we'll fix it.

801
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,806
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

802
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,641
- We are appealing.
- We'll sort it out.

803
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,110
- They're killing us out there.
- Go an get your dick wet.

804
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,079
- You're a wanker!
- Fuck you!

805
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,048
You're fucking wanker!

806
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,150
But this was a good race
for you, no, Niki?

807
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,551
It's good for everyone

808
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,453
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

809
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,356
James, your 50 points behind
Lauda in the championship.

810
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,124
You've had
another retirement today.

811
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,659
What's going wrong?

812
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,661
It's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

813
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,563
that's what's going wrong.

814
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,799
So as we approach
the halfway point

815
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,834
in this year's Formula 1 season,

816
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,104
Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top

817
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:18,441
and James Hunt and McLaren
are struggling.

818
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,877
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

819
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,714
It's fine. Just got a little
problem with an Austrian rat

820
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,784
and his team of Italian cheats
who've destroyed my car.

821
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,921
- What are you talking about?
- About the race in Spain I won.

822
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,789
Yeah, in a car
which is not legal.

823
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,524
Five eighths
of an inch too wide.

824
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,827
You know that doesn't have
the slightest effect on speed.

825
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,528
But you complained
and your team of lawyers

826
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,498
leaned on the authorities.
Now we've had to rebuild the car

827
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,101
- and it's become a monster.
- At least it's a legal monster.

828
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,902
You've had to resort
to cheating.

829
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,172
You're driving an illegal car
and call me a cheater? Pathetic.

830
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,843
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

831
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:55,878
Thank you. Thank you.

832
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,649
Do you really think
it upsets me, James,

833
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:03,619
calling me a rat
because I look like one?

834
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,087
I don't mind it.

835
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,523
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody like them,

836
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,991
but they're very intelligent

837
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,360
and they have
a strong survival instinct.

838
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:12,428
Wonderful.

839
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,797
Leave this jerk alone.

840
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,966
No wonder she left him.

841
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,885
Anyone seen Suzy?

842
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,655
She's supposed
to be here today.

843
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,259
We didn't wanna tell you
before the race.

844
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,860
Tell me what?

845
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,830
SUZY JOINS THE BURTON SHOW

846
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,733
HUNT'S WIFE SEES ACTOR
AS LIZ FLIES TO MUM

847
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:51,901
Jesus.

848
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,803
Blonde model Suzy Hunt

849
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,506
stepped on to the dizzy
Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton

850
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,708
roundabout of romance
yesterday.

851
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:18,627
Is that from him?

852
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:19,929
Yeah.

853
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,871
So when did all this start?

854
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,441
That weekend I went skiing.

855
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,646
Why have you come here, James?

856
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,149
I've got to get you back.

857
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,918
You don't want me back.

858
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,753
You never wanted to be married
in the first place.

859
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,423
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

860
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,059
You did it because you hoped
it might change you,

861
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,161
settle you down,
help with the racing.

862
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,696
No, I didn't.

863
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,098
And who knows, if it
had been just the drinking,

864
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,201
or the dope, or the infidelity
or the moods,

865
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,637
it might even have worked.

866
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,639
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

867
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,741
No, you're not terrible.

868
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,979
You're just who you are
at this point in your life.

869
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,216
God help anyone who wants more.

870
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,786
And Richard Burton,

871
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,456
will he be able
to give you more?

872
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:24,360
You know, he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself.

873
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,096
What's important is
how it feels to me,

874
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,199
and it feels like he adores me.

875
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,106
James!

876
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,142
Are you and Suzy
getting back together?

877
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,411
It's all very amicable.

878
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,880
My wife has found herself
a new backer...

879
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,650
I mean, lover,
which makes her happy.

880
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,419
And Mr. Burton has found a way
of feeling young again,

881
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:51,620
which makes him happy.

882
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,590
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

883
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,059
And I found a way to be single
and have an ex-wife

884
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,061
without it costing me a penny,

885
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,930
which has to go down
as the biggest win of my career.

886
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,500
I have a flight to catch.

887
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,536
SUZY HUNT RACES
TO RICHARD BURTON

888
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,184
CIRCUIT PAUL RICARD
CHAMPIONNAT DU MONDE

889
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,789
We haven't seen
this sort of intensity

890
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,991
from James Hunt
all season long.

891
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,794
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

892
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,498
that their car is now fully
legal and faster than ever.

893
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,003
FRANCE -HUNT WINS
LAUDA RETIRES

894
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,676
Never mind the bloody wets.
We're still quick.

895
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,445
BRITISH GRAND PRIX

896
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,113
BRANDS HATCH
SUNDAY 18TH JULY 1976

897
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,416
Hunt has really closed
the gap on Lauda

898
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,484
as they head into Druids.

899
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,622
Niki Lauda is under
real pressure from James Hunt

900
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,391
as they go up the hill
into Druids Corner.

901
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:17,399
And Hunt is in front of Lauda!

902
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,809
So James Hunt
gets the plaudits of the crowd,

903
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,378
the first Briton to win
a British Grand Prix

904
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,948
at Brands Hatch
since Jim Clark in 1964.

905
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,353
At the moment you've got
a terrific edge over the rest,

906
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,622
how have you achieved
this advantage?

907
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:41,890
Big balls.

908
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,662
Following an inquiry
into the disqualification

909
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,631
of driver James Hunt
from the Spanish Grand Prix,

910
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:52,901
it has been decided to overturn
this disqualification

911
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,572
and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.

912
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,579
James!

913
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,548
A few weeks ago you were
out of the running completely

914
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,418
and now you're right back in it.
What's changed?

915
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,353
It's a combination of factors,

916
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,856
not all of which I'm prepared
to discuss here.

917
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,959
But justice being done re
the disqualification in Spain

918
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:20,062
helps and having my car
back at its best again.

919
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,932
Welcome to the legendary
Nrburgring.

920
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,635
This is a 14.2 mile track,

921
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:17,172
complete with 185 corners
and bends.

922
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,042
Niki, an autograph?

923
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:01,450
With the date, please.

924
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:02,851
The date? Why?

925
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,733
Welcome to the Nrburgring,

926
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,602
the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.

927
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,170
In Formula 1 it is known

928
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,705
as "The Graveyard."

929
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,574
The weather conditions
are far from ideal

930
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:29,144
and latest reports indicate
there is no relief in sight.

931
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:34,549
Gentlemen.

932
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:38,453
Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

933
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:39,755
Thank you.

934
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,723
- Niki Lauda.
- Thank you.

935
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,561
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

936
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:49,097
the Nrburgring is the most
stupid, barbaric, outdated

937
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:50,899
and dangerous track
in the world.

938
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,068
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

939
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,103
Those of you with experience
know the ring

940
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:57,973
needs perfect conditions
to be even remotely acceptable

941
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,574
in terms of risk.

942
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,877
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

943
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,913
so I called this meeting
to take vote to cancel the race.

944
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:06,715
Cancel the race?

945
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,651
There would be no change
to the situation

946
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:10,986
as far as points is concerned.

947
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,587
The race would simply
be cancelled.

948
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:13,655
This is bullshit!

949
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,791
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

950
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,126
That's true,
you leave without your fee,

951
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,395
but you might leave
with your life.

952
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,531
It also means that you
would effectively win

953
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,466
the championship.

954
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,569
So I can see why
this suits you just fine.

955
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:28,637
Why?

956
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,539
There won't be no points
for me either.

957
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:34,075
No, but there'd be one race less
where I, or anyone else here,

958
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,378
- could catch you.
- James is right.

959
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,446
This is just tactics!

960
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:41,149
Maybe he's just frightened.

961
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,019
Which asshole said this?

962
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,393
Yes, of course, I'm frightened,

963
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:52,928
and so are you.

964
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:56,464
I accept every time
I get in my car

965
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:59,701
there's 20% chance I could die,
and I can live with it,

966
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,803
but not one percent more.

967
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,573
And today, with the rain,
the risk is more.

968
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,676
I suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain.

969
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,611
I have the track record here.

970
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,547
I'm the only person in history
to do the ring in under 7 min.,

971
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,184
so, actually, it's to
my advantage to race here today.

972
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,120
Because I'm quicker
than all of you.

973
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,758
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

974
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:24,860
Yeah!

975
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,829
- Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.

976
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:30,198
Why are we here, Niki?
Come on.

977
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:38,173
Well, all those in favor
of cancelling the race.

978
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,785
All those in favor of racing.

979
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,827
Gentlemen, the race is on.

980
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:07,869
- Ridiculous.
- What a waste of time.

981
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,138
You know, Niki,
every now and then

982
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,741
it helps if people like you.

983
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,091
In places the track
is still dangerously wet,

984
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,794
but following a drivers meeting,
a decision has been taken.

985
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,004
One minute to go.

986
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,717
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

987
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,420
- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.

988
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,855
Then we stay on wets too.

989
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,966
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

990
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:14,402
All right, fire her up.

991
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:31,686
This season's fight
for the F1 World Championship

992
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,723
has so far been the story
of two men.

993
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:38,560
Thus far it's been going pretty
much the way of Niki Lauda.

994
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:41,129
But James Hunt
has qualified fastest here.

995
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:43,765
He is on pole position
for the German Grand Prix

996
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,135
with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.

997
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,605
It's a long race.

998
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,607
If the track starts to dry out,

999
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:56,244
the wet-weather tyres
will no longer be as quick.

1000
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,533
Niki Lauda and James Hunt,

1001
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,635
side by side
on the front of the grid,

1002
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,138
go away absolutely as one!

1003
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,154
Lauda very aggressive
on Hunt there,

1004
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,890
forcing the McLaren
onto the grass.

1005
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:49,164
Lauda has the lead right now!
He leads into the first corner!

1006
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,466
Hunt is in second place!

1007
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,506
Mass storming past Hunt!

1008
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:02,077
He made the right choice to go
with the dry-weather tyres.

1009
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,846
Mass passing Lauda now!

1010
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,883
Jochen Mass, in the number 12
McLaren, takes the lead!

1011
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,619
Jochen Mass, the clear leader,
with everybody else

1012
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,788
making the decision
to change tyres

1013
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,523
after just one lap of this race.

1014
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,492
Come on, let's go!

1015
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:29,504
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should've taken my advice.

1016
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,739
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

1017
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,976
Behind you.
He made the same mistake.

1018
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:47,822
Come on!

1019
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,895
Come on! What's going on?

1020
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:57,899
The tyre-changing frenzy caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

1021
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,835
- with Mass in the lead now.
- You're clear. Go!

1022
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,874
Lauda urging
his mechanics to hurry.

1023
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:11,479
It's a disaster! Come on!

1024
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,092
What's going on, you assholes?

1025
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:50,118
This race has gone wrong
for him so far.

1026
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,053
His championship rival,
James Hunt,

1027
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,189
is a long way up the road.

1028
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,768
Lauda passing car after car.
He's just going past

1029
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,137
Mario Andretti's Lotus there.

1030
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,051
Niki!

1031
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,192
Get me out!

1032
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:05,426
Help me!

1033
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,931
Several cars are involved.

1034
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,433
Looks like it might be
one of the Ferraris.

1035
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,909
- Come this way!
- Come on, come on!

1036
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:35,590
Keep trying.

1037
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,899
- Come this way.
- Okay.

1038
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,633
The flood, which swept down
Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado,

1039
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:28,069
was the worst
since records began.

1040
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:30,838
In Formula 1 today,
victory celebrations were muted

1041
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,040
after a horrific accident
involving world champion

1042
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,742
Niki Lauda.

1043
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,778
Due to safety concerns
before the race,

1044
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,080
the Austrian had said
he would not take part,

1045
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,149
but in the end he did.

1046
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,452
He was making up for lost
time when he went off the track,

1047
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,788
puncturing the Ferrari's
fuel tank.

1048
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:49,757
Brett Lunger was unable
to avoid the flaming wreck

1049
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:52,693
but was unhurt and joined
other drivers to rescue Lauda,

1050
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:55,730
who was taken to Manheim
Hospital with severe burns,

1051
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:59,367
the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.

1052
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,469
Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute

1053
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:04,639
in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.

1054
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,170
14 DAYS LATER

1055
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:59,787
28th DAY IN HOSPITAL
29th AUGUST 1976

1056
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:47,655
ITALIAN GRAND PRIX
FREE PRACTICE SEPTEMBER 1976

1057
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:53,160
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

1058
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:54,595
Looking good.

1059
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,634
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

1060
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:02,837
- What about him?
- He's here.

1061
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,839
- What?
- He's racing.

1062
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,021
Niki.

1063
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,730
It's that bad, huh?

1064
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:31,766
No.

1065
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:36,537
In hospital, I asked them
straight, no bullshit,

1066
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,373
how bad my appearance would be.

1067
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,343
They said with time
it would be fine.

1068
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:43,811
But it won't.

1069
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,948
I can tell,
seeing your reaction.

1070
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,618
I'll spend the rest of my life

1071
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:53,554
with a face
that frightens people.

1072
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:59,160
You know, Niki, I tried to write
you a letter at the time,

1073
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,761
to apologise.

1074
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,064
The drivers' meeting in Germany,
before the race.

1075
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,934
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

1076
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,703
That race should never
have gone ahead.

1077
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,572
No, it shouldn't.

1078
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:15,509
So in many ways I feel
responsible for what happened...

1079
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:16,877
You were.

1080
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:19,914
But, trust me,

1081
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,651
watching you win those races,

1082
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,253
while I was fighting
for my life...

1083
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:31,492
you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car.

1084
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:01,488
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

1085
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:02,890
Niki,

1086
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:06,460
can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you had

1087
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,462
and the expectations
for you recovery?

1088
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,563
Sure.

1089
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:11,765
I had a skin graft operation

1090
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,768
where they put half
my right thigh in my face.

1091
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,572
Now, it doesn't look too good,

1092
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,841
but one unexpected advantage is

1093
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:23,010
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

1094
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,412
so sweat will never run
into my eyes again,

1095
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,882
which is good for a driver.

1096
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,885
When they heard about
your condition,

1097
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,520
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver,

1098
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:34,788
Carlos Reutemann.

1099
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:38,492
Yeah, before ever reaching
the hospital.

1100
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:42,229
- Is Reutemann driving today too?
- Yes.

1101
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,665
And keen to make an impression.

1102
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,667
So let's see where
Mr. Reutemann finishes

1103
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,103
and where I finish today.

1104
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:51,639
James Hunt and McLaren
have caught up a lot

1105
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:53,607
while you were away.

1106
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:54,675
Yes.

1107
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:56,944
So is there a question now

1108
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:59,980
or are you just trying
to piss me off?

1109
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,918
You still think you can win?

1110
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,619
Yes, of course.

1111
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,221
I have the better car.

1112
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:10,457
And possibly
I'm the better driver.

1113
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:13,027
But he's a clever guy
and he's used his time well

1114
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,696
while I was lying
half-dead in hospital

1115
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,631
to win some points.

1116
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,436
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1117
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,543
She said, "Sweetie,

1118
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:32,947
you don't need a face to drive.
You just need the right foot."

1119
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:35,916
I'm being serious.

1120
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,153
Do you really think
your marriage can survive

1121
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,755
with the way you look now?

1122
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,659
And I'm being serious too.

1123
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:47,528
Fuck you.

1124
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:50,097
Press conference over.

1125
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:58,038
- That was hairy.
- You know how to get noticed.

1126
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,840
I thought it went well,
to be honest.

1127
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,809
They don't like it
when it's not going their way.

1128
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,444
That's the game.

1129
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,579
- See you.
- See you later.

1130
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,781
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1131
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:10,484
I think I've got something
for you on that last question,

1132
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,786
- about Niki.
- You heard about that?

1133
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:15,756
James?

1134
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,933
Please, James...

1135
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:29,870
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1136
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,240
Prick.

1137
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:52,493
So Niki Lauda, just 42 days

1138
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:55,095
after his near-fatal accident
at Nrburgring,

1139
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:56,764
will race here today, at Monza

1140
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,701
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain.

1141
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:08,809
Photographers, please,
clear the grid.

1142
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:47,948
Niki, it's time.

1143
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:50,851
Okay?

1144
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,827
Please, clear the grid.

1145
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:03,964
One minute to go.

1146
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:53,013
The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.

1147
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:55,983
He's been overtaken
by car after car.

1148
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,428
Lauda's off line.
He runs wide onto the grass.

1149
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:15,402
He wrestles it back
onto the track,

1150
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:17,804
but that was a bad moment
for Niki.

1151
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,111
Niki Lauda's the reigning
world champion,

1152
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:27,347
but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,

1153
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:30,517
to himself and to the rest
of the field.

1154
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,989
And Stuck has collided
with Mario Andretti's Lotus!

1155
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:39,059
Niki's boxed in!
He's got nowhere to go!

1156
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:55,909
Niki Lauda's actually
making a move.

1157
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:58,145
He's on Brambilla's tail.

1158
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:03,684
He pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake.

1159
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:05,886
Lauda's starting
to find the form

1160
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,822
that early in this race
we believed he'd lost.

1161
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,464
Lauda's now lapping faster
than Reutemann

1162
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,733
and closing the gap ahead.

1163
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:25,105
Lauda closing
on Carlos Reutemann,

1164
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,474
the man called in to be
his replacement

1165
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:29,142
in the Ferrari team.

1166
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:39,753
And there's James Hunt's
McLaren,

1167
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:43,156
smoking stationary
by the side of the road.

1168
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:48,862
This is bad news for Hunt's
championship hopes.

1169
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:54,901
It's Ronnie Peterson

1170
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,371
who comes home the winner
here at Monza.

1171
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:00,574
But all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth!

1172
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,542
Niki Lauda!

1173
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,453
What a race, what a man,
what a season.

1174
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:48,622
With a 4th-place finish
and three priceless points,

1175
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:50,724
Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

1176
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:53,627
to retaining
the World Championship.

1177
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:54,921
So the long, grueling
and incredibly dramatic season

1178
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:57,858
comes down to this final race
in Japan,

1179
01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:00,494
in the shadow of Mount Fuji.

1180
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:03,830
Niki Lauda goes into
this deciding race at Fuji

1181
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:06,133
just three points ahead
of James Hunt,

1182
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:09,136
Hunt knowing he must beat
the Austrian fair and square

1183
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:10,937
to take the title.

1184
01:30:12,006 --> 01:30:15,475
James, do you think
you can cope with the pressure?

1185
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:17,844
Well, I've never really
understood what that means.

1186
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,081
I love my job.
I love competing. I love racing.

1187
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,184
Maybe you should ask Niki.
He's the World Champion.

1188
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,819
He's got everything to lose.

1189
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:28,121
Mr. Lauda,
are you feeling pressure?

1190
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,824
Do I look like
I'm feeling pressure?

1191
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:33,894
I'm World Champion

1192
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,963
and on the verge to become
World Champion again.

1193
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:39,399
Hunt now has
the opportunity to win,

1194
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,168
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1195
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:44,004
You have to really believe it
to make it possible.

1196
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:46,640
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1197
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:49,075
If Niki is being tricky
and getting a kicky

1198
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,478
out of playing mind games,

1199
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:53,146
then fine, I'm flattered.

1200
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:56,650
The fact is momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1201
01:30:57,051 --> 01:30:59,386
I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

1202
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,121
will be with me
as World Champion.

1203
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,128
Intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast

1204
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:11,031
here at Fuji today,
along with strong winds

1205
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:12,599
and occasional fog

1206
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:14,968
rolling in from the mountain.

1207
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:19,139
And so with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,

1208
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:21,608
Lauda's lead
a mere three points.

1209
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:23,477
What a way to finish the season.

1210
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:24,878
Hunt or Lauda?

1211
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:27,547
The final chapter will unfold
when we bring you

1212
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:29,850
- extended coverage...
- They've got to cancel the race.

1213
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:31,184
It's lethal out there.

1214
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:33,086
The race is going ahead.

1215
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:35,589
Television rights have been
sold all around the world.

1216
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:36,957
The showdown
between you and Niki

1217
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:38,558
is all anyone wants to see.

1218
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:41,661
With heavy rain continuing
to fall here at Fuji,

1219
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:43,930
a decision
has finally been made.

1220
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:47,501
The 1976 Japanese Grand Prix
will go ahead.

1221
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:51,204
All drivers
to your cars, please.

1222
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:17,564
Five minutes to go.

1223
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,575
- All right?
- All right.

1224
01:33:01,809 --> 01:33:03,977
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1225
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:05,645
To let the condensation out.

1226
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,515
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1227
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,851
Trust me, this race is all
about the start.

1228
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,121
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1229
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:31,972
Okay, start the bastard.

1230
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:35,742
Good luck, kid.

1231
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,646
Good luck, James!

1232
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,919
30 seconds to go.

1233
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:41,941
Electric tension here at Fuji.

1234
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,411
80,000 bedraggled race fans

1235
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:47,547
and the racing grudge match
of the decade.

1236
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,783
And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,

1237
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,951
James Hunt alongside him.

1238
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:55,155
On row two of the grid,

1239
01:34:55,389 --> 01:34:56,723
there is Niki Lauda,

1240
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:59,559
and on row three of the grid,
Joe Schecketer from South Africa

1241
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:01,027
in the six-wheel Tyrrell.

1242
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:04,164
Behind him, the rest
of the 25-car field.

1243
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:23,750
There's the flag and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix

1244
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,518
is underway!

1245
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:40,366
In this conditions it must be
almost impossible

1246
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:43,169
to drive a 450-horsepower car!

1247
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:12,132
And it's Andretti
who has the lead,

1248
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:13,566
but Hunt is attacking.

1249
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:15,802
Hunt's going round
the outside ofAndretti!

1250
01:36:16,036 --> 01:36:17,670
Niki Lauda
following him through!

1251
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:20,740
Hunt leads into the first
right-hander!

1252
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:06,486
Hunt comes through to complete
his first lap leading the field.

1253
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:08,655
At least he has clear vision
in front of him.

1254
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,691
Niki Lauda behind him,
eating his spray.

1255
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,111
Lauda is slowing!

1256
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:36,082
Niki Lauda is bringing
the Ferrari no. 1 into the pit!

1257
01:37:36,784 --> 01:37:39,452
Some sort of problem,
we can't imagine what,

1258
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:41,521
so early in the race.

1259
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:50,163
What's wrong with the car?

1260
01:37:50,831 --> 01:37:52,832
Niki! What's wrong with the car?

1261
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:55,168
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1262
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:00,940
What are you doing?

1263
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:02,041
I'm stopping.

1264
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:04,110
His mechanics are asking
what the problem is.

1265
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:06,679
But wait! Niki Lauda's
getting out of the car!

1266
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:08,448
This is sensational!

1267
01:38:08,682 --> 01:38:10,617
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda,

1268
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:12,385
is out of this race.

1269
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:13,953
It's too dangerous.

1270
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:15,755
Niki, you want me to say

1271
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:18,324
there was a problem
with the car, for the media?

1272
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:19,392
No.

1273
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:21,961
Tell them the truth.

1274
01:38:22,663 --> 01:38:24,430
Now, what is happening?

1275
01:38:24,665 --> 01:38:26,399
They're talking
to the team manager.

1276
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:28,935
Lauda explaining something.

1277
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:46,686
With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish

1278
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:50,723
this race in third place
or higher to be World Champion.

1279
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:53,693
But the job's not done yet
for James Hunt.

1280
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,495
In these dreadful conditions,

1281
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:58,131
he still has to go the distance.

1282
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:01,567
Fifteen laps to go
here at Fuji.

1283
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:03,603
James Hunt or Niki Lauda?

1284
01:39:03,837 --> 01:39:06,673
This extraordinary season
is not over yet.

1285
01:39:06,907 --> 01:39:10,109
In this treacherous final round,
can James Hunt hang on?

1286
01:39:14,214 --> 01:39:15,882
Hunt in the lead.

1287
01:39:17,217 --> 01:39:19,786
Oh, God, his tyres,
they're blistering.

1288
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:24,524
Brambilla very close behind him,
closing on him all the time.

1289
01:39:24,758 --> 01:39:27,860
And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.

1290
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:30,830
Hunt cuts across
the orange March nose.

1291
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:32,865
Hunt not having that at all.
And he's spinning.

1292
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:36,636
He missed Hunt but almost took
James Hunt out of the race

1293
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,671
and out
of the world championship.

1294
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:42,141
Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.

1295
01:39:46,613 --> 01:39:48,648
Mario Andretti's
going past Hunt!

1296
01:39:48,882 --> 01:39:51,884
Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.

1297
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,791
Despite this wet conditions,

1298
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:01,561
these wet-weather tyres
wear extremely fast.

1299
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:03,496
Hunt's tyres, they're gone.

1300
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:06,933
Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.

1301
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:11,771
That back marker's
going past Hunt.

1302
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:14,240
LAP 70
4 LAPS TO GO

1303
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:26,419
Look at that left front tyre,
right front tyre, sorry.

1304
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:29,689
No tread on it at all.
And the other one is flat.

1305
01:40:29,923 --> 01:40:31,257
Let's go! Let's go!

1306
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:38,765
Okay? When did you break
your gear lever?

1307
01:40:38,999 --> 01:40:40,566
Nine or ten laps ago.

1308
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:42,935
- Alistair, we need to lift it!
- Come on!

1309
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,704
- At the front!
- Let's go!

1310
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:47,774
Regazzoni's Ferrari and
Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier

1311
01:40:48,008 --> 01:40:49,509
have gone ahead.

1312
01:40:49,743 --> 01:40:51,010
Come on, hurry!

1313
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:54,680
You did it. You're going
to be World Champion!

1314
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:56,082
Not yet.

1315
01:40:56,316 --> 01:40:59,685
A few laps ago, James Hunt
was looking like champion elect.

1316
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,688
Now it looks as though
it's all gone wrong for him.

1317
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:05,425
- James.
- Come on!

1318
01:41:05,659 --> 01:41:06,559
- Listen.
- What?

1319
01:41:06,794 --> 01:41:08,928
Just go easy out there.

1320
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:12,832
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1321
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,068
We want you back in one piece.

1322
01:41:15,302 --> 01:41:18,438
You're too far back. There's too
many drivers in front of you.

1323
01:41:18,672 --> 01:41:21,941
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1324
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:23,910
Clear!

1325
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:25,478
James!

1326
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:29,115
- Clear!
- Fuck it!

1327
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,189
James Hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position.

1328
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:40,526
There are four laps to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit.

1329
01:42:00,147 --> 01:42:01,714
Concentrate, Superstar.

1330
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,716
Just brings it back
under control!

1331
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:06,786
Sliding the McLaren
on the very edge there.

1332
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:11,457
Hunt's M23 twitching this way
and that under braking.

1333
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:12,825
And he almost loses it
right there.

1334
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:14,427
Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte

1335
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:16,095
in the blue Ligier.

1336
01:42:23,737 --> 01:42:25,471
Don't do it, James.

1337
01:42:28,008 --> 01:42:29,642
He's inches away
from the pit wall!

1338
01:42:29,877 --> 01:42:31,878
He's inches away
from the Ligier!

1339
01:42:40,854 --> 01:42:42,922
James Hunt has made up
another place,

1340
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:46,192
but it's not enough
and this race is running out.

1341
01:42:54,668 --> 01:42:57,570
And Watson has spun!
Watson has spun!

1342
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:03,843
Hunt manages to weave his way
between the back marker

1343
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:06,112
and the stationary Penske.

1344
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:08,748
He's catching Regazzoni,
but in these conditions,

1345
01:43:08,982 --> 01:43:12,485
it's one thing to catch up,
quite another to overtake.

1346
01:43:15,656 --> 01:43:18,090
He's alongside Clay Regazzoni!
This could be

1347
01:43:18,325 --> 01:43:20,126
the world championship!

1348
01:43:27,834 --> 01:43:29,535
He's got him!

1349
01:43:44,985 --> 01:43:46,719
Hunt crosses the line.

1350
01:43:46,954 --> 01:43:49,822
He needed to finish third
to score enough points

1351
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,424
to be World Champion,

1352
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:53,759
and in the confusion here
we're being told

1353
01:43:53,994 --> 01:43:55,494
that he may have finished 5th.

1354
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:56,729
He finished fifth?

1355
01:43:57,998 --> 01:44:00,466
Our lap charts show Hunt
in third place.

1356
01:44:00,701 --> 01:44:02,335
Well, if the scoreboard's right,

1357
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:04,971
it means he's just missed out
on the championship.

1358
01:44:05,205 --> 01:44:08,708
Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.

1359
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:14,847
I can see the race stewards
conferring,

1360
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:17,116
examining
the official lap charts.

1361
01:44:17,351 --> 01:44:20,453
We're just going to have to wait
for their verdict here.

1362
01:44:37,137 --> 01:44:38,471
Let's get you
out of here, buddy.

1363
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:40,740
I'm sorry, Teddy. I thought
I could make up the ground.

1364
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:42,842
Sorry? What are you
talking about? You did it!

1365
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:45,745
- Did what?
- Jesus! You crazy bastard!

1366
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:48,381
You came 3rd!
You got the points!

1367
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:50,016
You're champion of the world!

1368
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:53,052
James Hunt is now
officially confirmed

1369
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:55,655
as finishing third
here in Japan,

1370
01:44:55,889 --> 01:44:59,025
and that means he
is champion of the world.

1371
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:03,329
Our new World Champion,
James Hunt,

1372
01:45:03,563 --> 01:45:05,965
by just one single point.

1373
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,673
Did we really win?

1374
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:18,911
World bloody Champion!

1375
01:45:27,721 --> 01:45:31,557
- What are you going to do now?
- I shall be getting drunk.

1376
01:45:32,559 --> 01:45:34,994
It's wonderful, absolute dream.

1377
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:25,044
And our special guest,
Formula 1 champion, James Hunt.

1378
01:46:25,278 --> 01:46:27,813
JAMES HUNT
WORLD CHAMPION

1379
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:39,759
JAMES HUNT
AGAINST ALL ODDS

1380
01:46:49,636 --> 01:46:51,637
Wait. Come on.

1381
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:57,543
There's no better motor oil
than Havoline.

1382
01:47:08,455 --> 01:47:11,624
- Yes, me too. Where we going?
- Anywhere I want to go.

1383
01:47:11,858 --> 01:47:14,093
And I don't have
to hijack it, either.

1384
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:16,362
As long as I pay for it.

1385
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:18,898
I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

1386
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:31,444
- Where are you going?
- You lot go ahead.

1387
01:47:31,678 --> 01:47:33,446
I won't be a minute.

1388
01:47:35,015 --> 01:47:35,948
Niki!

1389
01:47:38,985 --> 01:47:40,453
Good to see you!

1390
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,625
I heard you were spending
more and more time

1391
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:48,861
- in one of these.
- Do you fly?

1392
01:47:49,095 --> 01:47:49,862
No.

1393
01:47:50,096 --> 01:47:52,598
- I don't think they'd insure me.
- You should try.

1394
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:53,833
It's good for discipline.

1395
01:47:54,067 --> 01:47:55,401
You have to stay
within the rules,

1396
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:57,102
stick to regulation,
suppress the ego.

1397
01:47:57,337 --> 01:47:59,038
It helps with the racing.

1398
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:01,774
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

1399
01:48:02,008 --> 01:48:05,444
- about the romance of flight.
- No, that's all bullshit.

1400
01:48:06,947 --> 01:48:08,681
So what brings you here?

1401
01:48:08,915 --> 01:48:10,449
A friend's wedding.

1402
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:11,784
At least I think
it was a wedding.

1403
01:48:12,018 --> 01:48:13,018
Might have been a birthday
or something.

1404
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:14,687
It's all a bit of a blur.

1405
01:48:14,921 --> 01:48:17,590
- Have you been at Fiorano?
- Pre-season testing.

1406
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:19,558
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1407
01:48:19,793 --> 01:48:21,494
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

1408
01:48:21,728 --> 01:48:24,363
When do you start testing?
Next week?

1409
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:26,065
No. What, are you nuts?

1410
01:48:26,299 --> 01:48:27,700
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

1411
01:48:27,934 --> 01:48:30,002
so I could get
right back to work.

1412
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:32,571
Why? You have to.

1413
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,040
To prove to all the people

1414
01:48:35,275 --> 01:48:36,876
who will always say
you just won it because...

1415
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:40,412
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

1416
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:44,383
Niki, is that other people
or is that you?

1417
01:48:44,618 --> 01:48:45,784
I won, okay?

1418
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:47,586
On the all-important day
when it came down to it,

1419
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:50,523
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1420
01:48:50,757 --> 01:48:52,758
And I put my life on the line
and I saw it through.

1421
01:48:52,993 --> 01:48:54,793
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1422
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:57,429
The risks were totally
unacceptable.

1423
01:48:57,664 --> 01:48:59,098
You were prepared to die.

1424
01:48:59,332 --> 01:49:01,634
- To me, that's losing.
- Yes, I was. I admit it.

1425
01:49:01,868 --> 01:49:04,470
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1426
01:49:04,704 --> 01:49:06,472
And that's the effect
you have on me.

1427
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:09,642
You'd pushed me that far.
And it felt great!

1428
01:49:10,176 --> 01:49:12,678
I mean, hell, isn't that
what we're in this for?

1429
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:15,581
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

1430
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:18,484
Come on,
there's nobility in that.

1431
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:20,486
It's like being knights.

1432
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:23,088
You English,
you're such assholes.

1433
01:49:23,323 --> 01:49:25,357
You know my position.

1434
01:49:25,592 --> 01:49:26,592
20% risk.

1435
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:29,361
No, Niki, don't bring
the percentages into this.

1436
01:49:29,596 --> 01:49:30,829
Don't be a pro.

1437
01:49:31,064 --> 01:49:33,566
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

1438
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,434
You kill the sport.

1439
01:49:38,505 --> 01:49:41,440
James!

1440
01:49:45,145 --> 01:49:46,645
I've got to go.

1441
01:49:48,148 --> 01:49:50,182
Careful in this thing.

1442
01:49:51,184 --> 01:49:52,217
James.

1443
01:49:57,857 --> 01:50:01,427
In hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1444
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:03,862
Pumping the shit
out of my lungs.

1445
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:05,497
It was hell.

1446
01:50:05,966 --> 01:50:08,434
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

1447
01:50:08,668 --> 01:50:11,370
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1448
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:14,373
"That bastard, Hunt," I'd say.
"I hate that guy."

1449
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:16,141
And one day,
the doctor came and said,

1450
01:50:16,376 --> 01:50:18,777
"Mr. Lauda, may I offer
a piece of advice?"

1451
01:50:19,012 --> 01:50:21,013
"Stop thinking of it as a curse
to have been given

1452
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:22,615
an enemy in life."

1453
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:24,617
"It can be blessing too."

1454
01:50:24,851 --> 01:50:26,185
"A wise man gets more
from his enemies

1455
01:50:26,419 --> 01:50:28,087
than a fool from his friends."

1456
01:50:28,321 --> 01:50:30,956
And you know what?
He was right.

1457
01:50:32,892 --> 01:50:34,093
Look at us.

1458
01:50:34,327 --> 01:50:36,795
We were both a pair of kids
when we met.

1459
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:39,064
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1460
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:42,267
Disowned by our families.
Headed nowhere.

1461
01:50:42,969 --> 01:50:45,704
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1462
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:47,506
It was not bad.

1463
01:50:47,907 --> 01:50:49,808
No, it's not bad.

1464
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:51,977
So don't let me down now.

1465
01:50:52,212 --> 01:50:53,879
I need you busting my balls.

1466
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:56,982
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1467
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:59,785
But I intend to enjoy
myself first.

1468
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:02,354
Some of life needs to be
for pleasure.

1469
01:51:02,589 --> 01:51:05,557
What's the point of having a
million cups, medals and planes

1470
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:08,127
if you don't have any fun?

1471
01:51:08,628 --> 01:51:10,863
How is that winning?

1472
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:14,566
- James!
- We're gonna leave without you!

1473
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:15,668
James!

1474
01:51:19,839 --> 01:51:21,974
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1475
01:51:23,043 --> 01:51:24,176
You will...

1476
01:51:24,644 --> 01:51:25,577
champ.

1477
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:29,882
You look good, Niki.

1478
01:51:30,116 --> 01:51:33,852
The only guy to have burnt his
face and it be an improvement.

1479
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:42,461
Of course he didn't
listen to me.

1480
01:51:42,762 --> 01:51:45,864
For James, one world title
was enough.

1481
01:51:46,099 --> 01:51:48,967
He had proved
what he needed to prove,

1482
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:52,805
to himself
and anyone who doubted him.

1483
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:56,475
And two years later he retired.

1484
01:51:56,710 --> 01:51:59,778
When I saw him next
in London seven years later,

1485
01:52:00,146 --> 01:52:02,114
me as champion again,

1486
01:52:02,348 --> 01:52:03,849
him as broadcaster,

1487
01:52:04,084 --> 01:52:07,853
he was barefoot on a bicycle,
with a flat tyre.

1488
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:11,590
Still living each day
like his last.

1489
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:16,595
When I heard he'd died aged 45,
of a heart attack,

1490
01:52:16,930 --> 01:52:18,864
I wasn't surprised.

1491
01:52:19,499 --> 01:52:21,500
I was just sad.

1492
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:24,970
People always think of us
as rivals,

1493
01:52:25,538 --> 01:52:28,707
but he was among
the very few I liked

1494
01:52:29,576 --> 01:52:32,444
and even fewer
that I respected.

1495
01:52:35,648 --> 01:52:38,717
He remains the only person
I envied.

1496
01:52:51,931 --> 01:52:54,633
