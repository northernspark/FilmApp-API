2
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,920
Please, let me go home. Please,
I'm not who you think I am.

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,501
I am really not who you think I am.

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,440
- Please, please, I'm not a spy.
- You are a spy.

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,279
Please let me go home.

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,879
Try again.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,439
I am not a spy, I am a businesswoman.

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,050
I work in the sale
of petroleum and gas.

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,919
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambition.

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,679
I'm not a spy. I'm not a spy.

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,280
I'm not a spy.

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
I am not a spy. I am not a spy.

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,800
Keep your head down and don't
say anything until we make the the swap.

14
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:58,278
In case Kim Jong here changes his mind.

15
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,488
Exchange.

16
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:22,720
I don't understand.

17
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,374
You don't understand what?

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,520
All the rules say to leave me, that one
life is not worth blowing operational cover.

19
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:34,591
You got that right.

20
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,256
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good,

21
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:38,160
we will.

22
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:40,000
So why did you do it?

23
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:41,388
Well...

24
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,891
I didn't do it.

25
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:45,475
He did.

26
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,880
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

27
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,656
He petitioned the Senate...

28
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,056
State department...

29
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,880
We didn't need the publicity, so I
figured we better do something or

30
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,585
he's gonna invade this
God damn Republic himself.

31
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:22,180
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,147
Hey.

33
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,157
- Good Morning.
- Happy Anniversary.

34
00:04:12,523 --> 00:04:14,168
You want me to make you breakfast?

35
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,615
How about pancakes?

36
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,260
You're cooking?

37
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:20,907
You're joking, you like my cooking.

38
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,960
Germans don't joke.

39
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:25,680
Bert likes my cooking.

40
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:34,870
Get your bugs off the table.

41
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,483
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,000
- Spiders.
- They're bugs.

43
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,360
Are you doing this on company time?

44
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,560
It's my anniversary and
I want it to be perfect.

45
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
But...

46
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
that is not sexy.

47
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,000
No, but it is utilitarian and
utilitarian is the new sexy.

48
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,759
Ran the trace, first name
Usem, last name Utsa.

49
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,479
- Any verifiable hits?
- Only one.

50
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,479
Francis, do me a favor...

51
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,920
stick it in the safe till tomorrow.

52
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,920
- Matahari here's got a big night tonight.
- Yes sir, Right away Sir.

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Sir?

54
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,640
Do I look like a, "Sir" to you?

55
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,440
From head to toe.

56
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm surprised he didn't
call you "Your Majesty".

57
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,920
I like the ring of that.

58
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,400
I think I prefer "Your Majesty".

59
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,440
Was I ever that young?

60
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,280
Younger.
Walk me out.

61
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,639
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

62
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,680
You know, the usual.

63
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,320
The President wants to know what's
happening in Russia the day before it happens.

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,719
What about you?
I heard that interview went well.

65
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,400
Hm... Fingers crossed

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,680
Are you sure about this?

67
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,880
Once you start pushing papers,
there's no turning back.

68
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,320
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

69
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
I was homesick.

70
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,280
Homesick?

71
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
Sir... Sir...

72
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,000
We got a walk-in...

73
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,439
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

74
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,559
- Here?
- Guess he's not buying our cover.

75
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,959
- You get his bona-fides?
- He's Russian.

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
He says he's FSB, but
won't give us any more.

77
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,080
- He's a strange guy.
- How's his English?

78
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,120
Passable, not great.

79
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,039
- But if we got down to the subtleties of English...
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me at home.

80
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,440
Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

81
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Come on Salt, no one can sort
out a nut job from the real thing faster than you.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,760
- I got 25 minutes.
- I got 26. Let's go.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,760
Yeah, okay. We'll
decide when we know more.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,360
- Who called Counter-Intelligence?
- Not me.

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,280
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

86
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
- Peabody.
- Salt.

87
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,920
Please remove the hood.

88
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,760
Microphones are on.

89
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
Checking levels.

90
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,800
Baseline recording.

91
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,640
Neuro-scan is up. Ready to go.

92
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,640
Commencing audio and visual recording.

93
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,640
Testing ear piece.

94
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,360
Interview has commenced at 14:42.

95
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
You're married.

96
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,879
A husband must be a distraction
for a female intelligence officer.

97
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,519
Well, we're here to talk about you.

98
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,960
So what is your name?

99
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,440
My name is Alec Vassilly Orlov.

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,200
I have cancer.

101
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
I'm moved.

102
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,880
A defector with cancer. Are you selling secrets for
chemo or are you afraid of dying?

103
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:41,120
If I have gained anything by damming myself,
it is that I no longer have anything to fear.

104
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,559
- Russia is also dying.
- Alec Vassilly Orlov.

105
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,519
Shows up in 1993 in
Novosibirsk blast, Siberia.

106
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,359
He's on Victor Rasovsky's staff there.
He checks out as FSB.

107
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,999
The scan says he's
truthful on the cancer.

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,680
Prior to '93...

109
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,039
Nothing...

110
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,520
He doesn't exist.

111
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,879
I have somewhere I
need to be, Mr. Orlov

112
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,360
So if you wouldn't
mind getting to the point.

113
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,880
In English please.
Others are listening.

114
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,680
1975, The Cold War.

115
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:48,000
In a gymnasium, a Soviet Olympic
wrestler named Sacha Jordorovich,

116
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,959
meets for the first time,

117
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,320
the only female
Chess Grandmaster of her era.

118
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,079
Within a month they were married.

119
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,080
And within a year, a child.

120
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
One month more,

121
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,360
the child was back
in the same hospital,

122
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,400
sick with fever.

123
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,920
And within days after that,
the child, suddenly was dead.

124
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,879
Yes,

125
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
a child was dead...

126
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,720
and yes,

127
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,800
a child was buried.

128
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,479
But the Chenkov baby was still alive.

129
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,880
And became the property of another man.

130
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:54,639
A master spy who had devised the greatest
plan a Russian patriot could ever invent...

131
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,400
A plan to destroy America.

132
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,840
It had all started with an
American named Lee Harvey Oswald.

133
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,560
In 1959,

134
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,559
he emigrated to Russia.

135
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,319
Three years later,

136
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,719
he returned home. But, the man who
came back to America, was in fact a Russian spy...

137
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
named Alec.

138
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,919
On November 22, 1963,

139
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,239
Alec became the first
success of the new program

140
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,160
and a hero of the Soviet Union.

141
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,640
The spy master was now given
the go ahead, to create many more like Alec.

142
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,079
Scores of agents.

143
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,839
Males and females

144
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,400
to be substituted for Americans.

145
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,360
At an abandoned monastery,
Chenkov and other boys

146
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,359
and girls learned English long
before they learned Russian.

147
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,320
Drilled in idiom, idiosyncrasy.

148
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,400
And ideology.

149
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,359
And by methods of rigorous
physical and psychological programming.

150
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,239
The spy master made warriors of iron.

151
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Unquestioned and unbreakable.

152
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,000
You're killing me, man.

153
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,359
When does the good fairy come in?

154
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
Never...

155
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,160
It's a story without hope.

156
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,919
Chenkov was matched with a child
of a visiting American family.

157
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:38,040
There was an accident, the family died.
Chenkov was sent to America,

158
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,680
to live a complete lie...

159
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,360
and to patiently await the
day to attack from within, day X.

160
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,000
The long awaited mission is here.

161
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:59,360
Chenkov will travel to New York City
to kill the President of Russia,

162
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:10,319
at the funeral of the
American Vice President. Chenkov is KA12.

163
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
KA12?

164
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,080
It's an urban legend.

165
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Highly trained Russian sleeper agents,
inserted into American society to sabotage and assassinate.

166
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,720
supposedly, they'd wait years to strike.
Decades even.

167
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,800
Hmm... Supposedly.

168
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,120
What's the matter, Ted?
You don't believe in moles?

169
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,000
I believe in moles, alright.
Just not the boogey man.

170
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,959
Specially if the plan is to
kill their own president.

171
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,560
This guy's selling smoke.

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
Wrap it up, Eve.

173
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,640
So a Russian agent is gonna kill
the Russian president. Is that it?

174
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,680
- Hmm...
- Okay.

175
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,280
Thank you very much

176
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,200
and what would you like in
return for that information?

177
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,280
I simply wish to help you
do what you need to do.

178
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,560
You're good.

179
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,080
KA-program is brilliant bull-shit,

180
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,159
but I'm officially off-duty,

181
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,680
so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

182
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,080
- Salt.
- Yes.

183
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,440
The name of the
Russian agent is, Salt. Evelyn Salt.

184
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,280
My name is Evelyn Salt.

185
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
Then you are a Russian spy.

186
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,560
<i>Truthful.</i>

187
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,800
So far, the FMRI has registered
truthful on everything he said.

188
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,320
Ted.

189
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,999
Call Protective Services and
make sure they find my husband.

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,399
- Where are you going?
- I need to get to the phone.

191
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,119
No, no. Not after the neuro-scan.

192
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,200
'Cause he didn't flutter?
I can beat that thing five

193
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,200
times out of six. I am
trained to and so is he.

194
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,840
I need my phone, I need to call my husband.

195
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,520
- Let me call my husband.
- Let me see it.

196
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,880
There is a reason he
mentioned my wedding ring Ted.

197
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,360
When they blow up a spy,
they don't just blow

198
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,360
up their cover, they blow up their
whole covered life, you know that.

199
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,439
- Yeah.
- Do you remember what happened to Henry's wife?

200
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,400
- Yes, I do.
- Speak.

201
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,799
"Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks, Bye".

202
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,920
Honey, it's me.
Please call me as soon as you get this.

203
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,479
Okay sweetheart? As soon as you get this.

204
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,360
Godspeed, comrade Chenkov.

205
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,599
Someone interrogate
that piece of shit.

206
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,240
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

207
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,639
Look Eve, try to stay calm...

208
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,359
I'm not a goddamn Russia spy.

209
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,720
I didn't say you were.

210
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,279
Let's go up to my office
so we can sort this out.

211
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,159
No, no. We gotta go to a secure location.

212
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,780
- Now.
- Alright.

213
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,920
Doesn't get anymore secure than this.

214
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,199
Eve?

215
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,320
Five minutes.

216
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Call Protective Services and
tell them to find Mike.

217
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,920
This is bullshit.

218
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,200
Give us a sec.

219
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,599
I know that we're heading into your jurisdiction here,
but I'm asking you for just 5 minutes.

220
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,320
No.

221
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,319
If I have to yes, you can't have
five minutes alone with her. I have to talk with her

222
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,079
- She's scared?
- I don't care.

223
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,319
There's a mole in
Russia house Ted.

224
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
There's a mole in
Russia house and I am sure...

225
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,840
Please step in the elevator.

226
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,760
What the hell is that?

227
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,560
Sir.

228
00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:17,361

229
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,919
Two minutes to go before we lock down.

230
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,280
We just got a match, Sir.

231
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,559
- In 1981, there's Bresnov and there...
- Orlov.

232
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,760
- That's him.
- Used to be a heavyweight once upon a time.

233
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,320
Get that photo out now. Every ticket counter

234
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,319
airport, train station and taxi
station, the whole nine yards.

235
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
- Get me director Medford on a secure line, now.
- Yes, Sir.

236
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,919
- Top-right screen, is that live?
- Yes sir.

237
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,640
- Where is she going?
- Track her.

238
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,999
Rink Petroleum Security.

239
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,199
You have a woman to your left behind you.

240
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,560
Evelyn Salt.

241
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,519
- We lost visual of her.
- Damn.

242
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,880
Where'd she go?

243
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,316
Hey, it's Evelyne. Is Mike there?

244
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:47,360
No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.

245
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,400
Hey, happy anniversary, hon.

246
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,599
Stairwell, second floor.

247
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,839
What's on that floor?

248
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
It's empty. Security buffer.

249
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,480
Isolate and seal it.

250
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,480
Get her records to my hand-held.

251
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,654
***

252
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,200
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

253
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,200
We got her.

254
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,919
Alright.

255
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,760
Get a tactical team to meet
me on the south stairwell.

256
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,240
Yes, Sir.

257
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,900
- Director Medford, Sir.
- Get me a side-arm.

258
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,120
I'll call her back.

259
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,320
- Shit.
- I lost visual.

260
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,680
Where is she, Albert? Talk to me.

261
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,280
Come on.

262
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,280
North hallway.

263
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,640
There, interrogation room. Bring it up.

264
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:16,530
- Have you found him?
- What the hell are you doing, Eve?

265
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,046
This don't look good.

266
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:22,470
There's a tac team coming
at you in 30 seconds. 

267
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,350
Get your goddamn panties off the camera. 

268
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,240
Get where we can see you, 
so you don't get hurt.

269
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,426
Have you found my husband?

270
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:29,527
These boys aren't fooling
around around, Eve.

271
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,000
- Please, I can't help you unless you talk to me.
- Call me when you find Mike.

272
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,480
Okay, open the doors, about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.

273
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,720
Is that absolutely necessary?

274
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,040
Want, do you want me to shoot her?

275
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,360
Get a medical team in place now.

276
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,120
Okay, on my count.

277
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,120
3, 2, 1...

278
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,900
Go.

279
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,320
Jesus Christ.

280
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,040
Where is she?

281
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,480
Come on, guys. Find her, now.

282
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,200
There. Bring that up.

283
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,400
Stay with her. She's crossing the street.

284
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
Pan the god-damned camera.

285
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,120
Back that up and zoom in.

286
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,760
Freeze.

287
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,320
What the hell are you doing, Eve?

288
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,559
Michael Krauss left his office an hour ago.

289
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,320
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes from here.

290
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,479
We can cover it, but she won't go there.

291
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,240
She will if she's serious about Mike.

292
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
This stays in the house, okay?

293
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,880
Taxi.

294
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,400
Hugh's street. I'll tell you where to stop.

295
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,480
"Hi, this is Mike. Please
leave a message after the tone".

296
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,959
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Eve.

297
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,760
And as such, enjoys pretty much unrestricted
access to the borders of North Korea.

298
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,959
So,

299
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,920
brush up on your
bugs and get to know him.

300
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,800
He's the perfect cover to get us inside.

301
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,600
Mike?

302
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,440
Mike?

303
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,920
Honey?

304
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,880
Hey baby. Come here.

305
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,880
It's alright.

306
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,760
It's okay. Where's daddy?

307
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,520
Where's daddy?

308
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,480
Go! Go!

309
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,520
Bathroom, clear.

310
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,680
Kitchen, clear.

311
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,160
Office, clear.

312
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,000
Living room, clear.

313
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,640
Everybody out in 60 seconds.

314
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,599
What are you doing?

315
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,999
She's not here and no sign
of the husband either.

316
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,359
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe that Russian was lying?

317
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:08,361
Why'd she run?

318
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:10,440
Oh, I don't know, cause you
were gonna lock her up.

319
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,279
See it from her perspective.
Maybe her husband is in some real danger.

320
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,120
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

321
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,440
"Maybe", is your department.
Mine is catching her, so we can find out.

322
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,880
Protocol is clear.
We bring her in, or we bring her down.

323
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,724
Do you have any idea who this woman is?

324
00:28:26,277 --> 00:28:28,711
What she's done for this country.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

325
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:30,079
Should it?

326
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,266
- Is your mom home?
- No.

327
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:36,906
- Can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

328
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:40,129
- Hi. Can you baby-sit Bert for me?
- Oh, yeah.

329
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:42,365
Yeah? Here's some money for food.

330
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:46,718
Whatcha doing? You doing homework?

331
00:28:46,736 --> 00:28:47,892
Yeah, Math.

332
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,939
- Algrebra.
- I hate math.

333
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:04,608
Hi.

334
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:05,836
It's nice to see you again.

335
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,800
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, I've seen you here before.

336
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,400
Yeah, I do. I come here a lot.

337
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,160
And you?

338
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,560
No, I'm working here at the museum.

339
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,320
I'm an arachnologist.

340
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,599
A what?

341
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,440
I hunt spiders.

342
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,400
I got her.

343
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,840
She's heading north
toward the metro-station.

344
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,940
Eve..?

345
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,240
She's east-bound in the mall.

346
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,320
There she is.

347
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,839
All teams south-bound toward the bridge.

348
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Box her in.

349
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Stop!

350
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,880
Stop!

351
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,880
Fuck!

352
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,120
Take it back. Hold your fire.

353
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Stop!

354
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,080
Salt!

355
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,559
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, I'm innocent.

356
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,999
On the ground, now.

357
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,759
Just don't shoot.

358
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,359
Salt, on the ground.

359
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,479
- I have to find my husband
- why'd you run?

360
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,399
- To find my husband
- For what reason?

361
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,599
Don't shoot.

362
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,079
- Stay back.
- Last chance.

363
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm innocent,
somebody is setting me up.

364
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,580
- Don't make me put you down, Salt.
- Put the god-damn gun down.

365
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,200
- Give yourself up, now!
- No.

366
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,040
On the ground.

367
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,960
We'll sort this out, I promise.

368
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,919
We gotta bring you in Salt.

369
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,439
Someone is gonna try to kill
the Russian president, you know that.

370
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,679
Do something about that.

371
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,520
- Give yourself up.
- That's what you should be worried about.

372
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
There's nowhere to run.

373
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,720
I didn't do anything.

374
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,240
She's on a blue semi,
route one, heading north.

375
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,240
Get a roadblock in place now.

376
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,720
There she is. On the tanker.

377
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,960
Stop! Stop!

378
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,840
Ev..!

379
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,560
- You, my friend, have got a mole in your group.
- We don't know that yet.

380
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,040
Actually, she's a
trained god damned liar.

381
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,432
Everything she's set up
until now, was to protect her cover.

382
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:45,797
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it.

383
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,560
Get off on the shoulder!
Get off on the shoulder!

384
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,980
Okay, take it down.

385
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,280
Shit.

386
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,480
Shit.

387
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,040
Okay.

388
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,760
Ted, I know you're her friend,

389
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,160
but we gotta drop a net on New York.

390
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,960
We gotta do it now.

391
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:32,680
I'll notify the
Secret Service on the base details.

392
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:36,940
Tell 'em Salt might be coming their way.

393
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:40,360
Here she is.

394
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,662
Orlov may not be far behind either.

395
00:35:44,738 --> 00:35:45,940
You seen this?

396
00:35:45,949 --> 00:35:47,640
Salt spent time in Russia
when she was a kid.

397
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:52,020
She was in the car accident with
her parents in '88, they both died.

398
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:57,869
They were teachers at the U.S Embassy
for the American children of the staff there.

399
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,874
That's why we put her on
Russia in the first place.

400
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:05,607
We need to get on a plane
to New York. Tonight.

401
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,905
And here in New York City,

402
00:36:56,025 --> 00:37:00,045
Security has been built up and preparations
are continuing well into the night

403
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:02,832
for the funeral of the Vice President 
Maxwell Oates.

404
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:05,480
Among the dignitaries that will
 be attending the service

405
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,589
tomorrow at St. Batholomew's church

406
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:10,036
is Russian President, Boris Matveyev,

407
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:12,585
who arrived here in Manhattan 
earlier this evening.

408
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:23,920
Evelyne, look at me.

409
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,120
If there was a way, I would kill them.

410
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:36,000
- You shouldn't have come here
- What do you mean? I don't understand.

411
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:39,588
Now they know who you are.

412
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,385
Who?

413
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,303
Evelyne.

414
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,076
Who?

415
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:53,659
I would accept anything about you,
but I need to know.

416
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:56,106
So, look at me. Look at me.

417
00:37:58,469 --> 00:38:00,487
Just tell me, okay?

418
00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:03,141
Just tell me.

419
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:06,298
I work...

420
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:09,898
I work for the CIA.

421
00:38:12,345 --> 00:38:13,852
You see, this...?

422
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,910
There is no future for us.

423
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:21,819
You're not safe with me.

424
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:25,385
I don't want to be safe.

425
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:29,531
I know you...

426
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:31,978
and I want to be with you.

427
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:36,847
I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

428
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:40,600
Okay?

429
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:43,369
Okay.

430
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:07,279
Welcome to New York
Ms. Hernandez. One night, a deluxe room?

431
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,167
Yeah.

432
00:39:08,748 --> 00:39:10,794
Ms. Hernandez, do you need 
any help with your luggage?

433
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,107
No, I got it. Thanks.

434
00:40:53,256 --> 00:40:55,800
<i>A solemn day here in New York City.</i>

435
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:58,865
<i>The funeral of Vice-President Maxwell Oates.</i>

436
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,600
<i>A former five term
U.S Senator and Cold War warrior.</i>

437
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
<i>His greatest legacy may be as architect of
the new era of Russian, American relations.</i>

438
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,765
<i>Russian President Boris Matveyev has
joined in from Moscow </i>

439
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:16,880
<i>to be an honorary forbearer to the man he's
called, "his greatest friend in the West".</i>

440
00:42:12,848 --> 00:42:14,728
What's the security perimeter?

441
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:18,074
We're too deep inside and we
own this entire block.

442
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:20,203
And those are secret service agents.

443
00:42:20,465 --> 00:42:22,652
Not CIA. So, relax.

444
00:42:23,205 --> 00:42:24,712
That's real funny.

445
00:42:25,403 --> 00:42:27,350
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

446
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:17,920
Step back! Step back!
Everybody, out of the way.

447
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,360
Mr. President.

448
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,360
Please be seated.

449
00:44:40,538 --> 00:44:46,001
Mrs. Oates... Ellen... John...

450
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,225
After the President finishes, the choir
sings the *** and delivers the eulogy...

451
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:54,280
If your girl tries anything here,
it'll have to be pretty amazing.

452
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,800
<i>I knew he would bring more to
the job than just his years of experience.</i>

453
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,400
<i>As Vice-President...</i>

454
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,240
<i>he showed the world best, of what
it is to be an American.</i>

455
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,560
<i>And today, the world says,
"Goodbye" to a great man</i>

456
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,708
- I'll take the back.
- Lower floor, clear.

457
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:56,471
My friend, Maxwell Oates,

458
00:45:56,844 --> 00:45:59,498
began the unlikeliest of crises.

459
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:01,199
***, come in.

460
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,909
What's your status, ***?

461
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:06,776
We got two M.I.A's.

462
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:10,260
*** 
utility tunnel outside the crypt.

463
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,520
I'm heading down to the crypt, some
kind of trouble down there.

464
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,320
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.

465
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,520
All teams converge in the crypt.
I repeat, converge in the crypt.

466
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,360
<i>He made all the difference and for that,
he will always have my respect and admiration.</i>

467
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,880
Matveyev!
Get god-damn Matveyev!

468
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,880
Drop it.

469
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,600
Drop it.

470
00:48:47,497 --> 00:48:48,336
Shooters at twelve o'clock.

471
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:52,406
Don't move.

472
00:48:54,628 --> 00:48:56,694
Take her down! Take her down!

473
00:48:56,696 --> 00:48:58,378
Check for other weapons

474
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,677
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

475
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:01,606
I can't feel a pulse.

476
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,920
Why?

477
00:49:19,245 --> 00:49:22,093
Do you have any idea how
much blood is on your hands?

478
00:49:22,494 --> 00:49:26,973
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.
I'm gonna see to it personally. A god-damn hole.

479
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,920
Back off! Back off!
Let's go!

480
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,600
Matveyev was declared
dead en route to the hospital.

481
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,040
Jesus Christ.

482
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,520
Yeah.

483
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,080
You were right about her.

484
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,600
She had the drop on me, Ted.

485
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,040
Why didn't she shoot?

486
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,200
Cops down, cops down.

487
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,400
<i>Get out of the car with
your hands on your head.</i>

488
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,760
Hands in the air.

489
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,439
- What is your name?
- My name is Evelyn Salt.

490
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,120
- What college will you attend?
- Princeton University.

491
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,359
- Where will you work?
- The Central Intelligence Agency.

492
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,079
Who will you trust?

493
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,400
No one.

494
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,880
Be very patient.

495
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,320
Remember your training.

496
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,879
Remember, you're not the only one.

497
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,480
There are many others...

498
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,160
- all of you waiting to strike.
- Yes.

499
00:53:31,169 --> 00:53:35,360
- And we will strike... together.
- Yes.

500
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,680
Wait.

501
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,080
One day I will come for all of you.

502
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,520
Hello Evelyn...

503
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,960
I'm Martin Crenshaw, from the U.S. Embassy.

504
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,400
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

505
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,400
Rioters outside the U.S embassy,
sheared their new leaders word in taking...

506
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,400
strong action against what they are calling,
"A state sponsored act of terrorism."

507
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,800
on this part of the U.S.

508
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,800
These rioters are starting similar outbreaks of
anti-American protests across Russia.

509
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,800
"We will strike back", says
the new Russian president.

510
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,760
Angrily condemning today's assassination,
by American intelligence officer Evelyn Salt.

511
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,360
Even as the body of slain
President Matveyev is on it's way back to Moscow,

512
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,359
anti-American riots have
erupted across Russia.

513
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,160
With bombings of U.S diplomats cars
in Moscow.

514
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,080
The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.

515
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,039
Responding to a rapidly escalating crisis.

516
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,800
President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting.

517
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,920
Greetings, comrade Orlov.

518
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,640
When I saw you in Washington
I almost was in tears.

519
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,920
You were not supposed to get married.

520
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,520
Not unless it cut a
great tactical advantage.

521
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,080
I did it to seem normal.

522
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:31,360
When you escaped today, I felt
even I could not have hoped for so much.

523
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,200
You are my greatest creation.

524
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,720
You trained me well.

525
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,280
My husband? You have him?

526
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,460
I had to be certain.

527
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,560
But now you trust me.

528
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,240
Completely.

529
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,000
So, tell me what's next.

530
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,640
Next, part 2.

531
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,920
We seize control of this
country's atomic weapons.

532
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,760
How?

533
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,319
You won't hear from me again.

534
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,600
My daughter.

535
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,020
Chenkov?

536
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,880
You remember me?

537
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,880
Chenkov.

538
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,400
Did you miss me?

539
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,560
Shnaider?

540
01:01:59,993 --> 01:02:01,800
How long have you been here?

541
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,836
I left Russia one year
after you, to Prague.

542
01:02:08,155 --> 01:02:11,265
I have been a NATO-liaison to the
White House for three years. 

543
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,726
Colonel Edward Tomasz.

544
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,819
And you...

545
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,833
are my attache. Your ID.

546
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,160
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

547
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,032
More importantly, our mission.

548
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,611
The bunker, eight stories
below the White House

549
01:02:31,427 --> 01:02:33,160
That's where the President needs to be.

550
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,119
How do we do it?

551
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,320
Don't worry, he will be there.
That's my job,

552
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,560
to make sure he's there.

553
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,200
And what's my job?

554
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,759
Do you remember Chenkov, when we were young?

555
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,319
and you had to finish first in everything.

556
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,199
You had to be the best at everything.

557
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,200
Even though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane you had to finish first.

558
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,200
I remember...

559
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,480
Tonight you will finish ahead of me again.

560
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,880
Tonight you will kill America's President.

561
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,320
ID's please.

562
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,440
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

563
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:35,397
Control, this is Hayes. I have a
Colonel Tomasz and a Major Egypt.

564
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:43,000
Colonel, Major... All clear.

565
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,000
You know the drill Colonel.

566
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:02,800
A shrapnel. A Serbian land-mine. They spend
more time looking at it than the doctor did.

567
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,680
Step though please, Sir.

568
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,320
Turn around.

569
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,120
Thank you.

570
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,520
Patience is key, I've been coming here
for two years. Others have been here longer.

571
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,879
- What others?
- I don't know.

572
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,320
But you were the best of us.
And I was the least.

573
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:38,240
There must be others here
to finish what we begin.

574
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,925
Tomasz, nice to see you again. 

575
01:04:40,045 --> 01:04:41,362
- Major ***.
- Pleasure.

576
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:44,252
You have exactly two minutes to preview 
*** before the main meeting.

577
01:04:45,413 --> 01:04:47,960
Ted, your Russian CIA agent, Salt...

578
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:50,022
what can you tell us about her?

579
01:04:50,142 --> 01:04:51,874
We think she may be a Soviet plant.

580
01:04:52,852 --> 01:04:56,879
Inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called "Day X".

581
01:04:57,283 --> 01:05:01,015
A day that would mark the start of a large
scale strike against the U.S and her allies.

582
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,040
That should be the President now.

583
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:16,440
You have a big job Chenkov, but you can do it.

584
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,280
- You still haven't told me what your job is.
- Home.

585
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,520
I'm going home.

586
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,720
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes.

587
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,720
- It's a god-damn attack.
- Geronimo, it's SOP. Downward mobile.

588
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,960
I think I saw her.

589
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,160
Saw who?

590
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,480
Salt.

591
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,960
I think I saw her in the corridor.

592
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,080
The other new officer.

593
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,000
She's here.

594
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,800
- Check.
- Clear. Move.

595
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,519
Go.

596
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,240
We may have a visual on the
second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

597
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,240
Evelyn Salt on the premises.
Maybe dressed as a NATO officer.

598
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:41,760
<i>This is not a drill.
We are under attack.</i>

599
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,780
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

600
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,720
I need this hallway
cleared to the left, now!

601
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,920
This is Jenkins. I need the
P.R bunker up and running.

602
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:58,306
If this was authorized by the
Russian Government, it is an act of war

603
01:06:58,426 --> 01:06:59,943
and we will respond.

604
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,920
Let's go, Sir.

605
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,680
Move, move.

606
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,680
Close it!
Close it!

607
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,000
Go!
Go!

608
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,720
Geronimo approaching. Close
the door in five seconds.

609
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,200
Clear.

610
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,512
Any chance she could follow?

611
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,212
Yeah, well....
Unfortunately, she isn't one of yours.

612
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,880
Okay, go.

613
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,680
Stay close. Shut the seal.

614
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,680
Geronimo is secured.

615
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,600
- Get me Director Medford.
- Yes, Sir.

616
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,400
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility,

617
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:18,400
that today, right now, could
be the start of "Day X".

618
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,760
Mr. President, director Medford is up.

619
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,079
Mary-Anne, what is the situation?

620
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,640
It should be coming up
on one of your screens.

621
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,559
What you see there, represents temperature
drops in mobile missile units in Siberia.

622
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,040
It means that the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.

623
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,720
And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr President.

624
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,040
Mr President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

625
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,720
At least on a forward basis.

626
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,820
Do it.

627
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,320
And since the Russians are deploying,
we need to look at our own nuclear attack options.

628
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,320
It's not on a table,
it's not a deterrent.

629
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,797
Thanks, Mary-Anne,
we'll come back to you.

630
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,120
Sir?

631
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,120
The outer door is jammed
and non-responsive.

632
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,199
We just lost the feed from
most of our security cameras.

633
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,880
We are blind down here and
no one can enter this facility.

634
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,320
Command, our eyes are down both ways and
we have a PEOC security door malfunction.

635
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,000
Get out there, now.

636
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:41,960
Seal this room.

637
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,360
Down that corridor, secure it.

638
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,199
This is President Howard Lewis,
proceed with authentication.

639
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,440
Yes, Mr President.

640
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,000
Ready to commence authentication, sir.

641
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,000
Zulu, Tango, Echo.
Seven, nine, Juliet.

642
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:56,000
X-ray, Sierra, seven,
Alpha, Mike, Charlie.

643
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,000
Whiskey, Five, Six, Tango.

644
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,679
Authentication is confirmed.

645
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,160
It's all yours now, Mr President.

646
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,920
God be with you.

647
01:12:07,674 --> 01:12:10,536
Attack options and targeting are
under your control, Mr President.

648
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,693
Agent Nobbler, what's your location?

649
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,839
- Is the camera outside this door working?
- Yes.

650
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,440
Put it up.

651
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,440
Officer, what is your status?

652
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,440
Officer, come in.

653
01:12:29,985 --> 01:12:31,353
Who the hell is that?

654
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:35,376
That's her.
That's Evelyn Salt.

655
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:38,902
Give me your side-arm,
I'm qualified on it.

656
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:42,324
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
fire-arms in the Presidents facility.

657
01:12:42,444 --> 01:12:44,066
Screw protocol, James.
we got an enemy agent out there.

658
01:12:44,186 --> 01:12:45,670
Protocol is protocol, Sir.

659
01:12:46,722 --> 01:12:48,588
And dead is dead.

660
01:12:52,926 --> 01:12:54,433
I'm the National Security Advisor.

661
01:12:55,152 --> 01:12:56,437
Not anymore.

662
01:13:03,585 --> 01:13:04,940
Sit down.

663
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,360
Who are you?

664
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:11,949
My name, Mr President,
is Nicolai Tarkovsky.

665
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:18,434
Unless you do exactly as I say,
I will be the last person you will ever see.

666
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:26,319
Let's have a look
at some attack options.

667
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:27,895
Go to hell.

668
01:13:58,657 --> 01:13:59,763
Ted?

669
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,240
Why didn't you tell me?

670
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,720
But you weren't with us in Russia,
I would've remembered you.

671
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,360
<i>Selected attack targets acquired.</i>

672
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,020
Tehran. Mecca.

673
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,200
Mecca... Tehran...

674
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,360
Missiles arming.

675
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,600
Nuclear command.

676
01:15:20,331 --> 01:15:22,170
You know, when we first came to Langley...

677
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,032
I didn't think
I'll be able to do it,

678
01:15:27,013 --> 01:15:28,313
I didn't think I'd be able to

679
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,760
to resist the
temptation to say something.

680
01:15:32,675 --> 01:15:36,712
And you met Mike and well...

681
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:39,035
things changed.

682
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,160
<i>"The Russian president is alive"</i>

683
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,400
What you are seeing are live pictures
of Russian President Matveyev,

684
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,399
arriving at the airport outside of Moscow.

685
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,320
This is astonishing.
According to his doctors...

686
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,280
President Matveyev's mistaken
death was attributed

687
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,280
to a temporary paralysis from
a toxin derived from spider venom.

688
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:42,675
At least I was right.

689
01:16:45,856 --> 01:16:48,560
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

690
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,729
I could see how moved you were with
Mike's little white knight routine.

691
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,899
You were supposed to recruit
the man, not fall in love with him.

692
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,300
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.

693
01:17:02,697 --> 01:17:04,640
By the way how is Mike?

694
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,176
Orlov is dead.

695
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:14,624
Oh, that's good news.

696
01:17:15,232 --> 01:17:16,850
Saves me the trouble.

697
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,198
I detect if you twist his arm, you get
to blow your cover to the CIA.

698
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,960
You see? He wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

699
01:17:31,033 --> 01:17:33,121
You needed somebody
to take the blame.

700
01:17:34,213 --> 01:17:35,595
I'm the patsy.

701
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,000
And I'm the hero.

702
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,600
Congratulations, Ev'.

703
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,640
You're about to become famous.

704
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,640

<i>Permission to launch.</i>

709
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,440
Get on the floor now.

710
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,160
I said now!

711
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,119
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!

712
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:42,959
What is your name sir?

713
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,360
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the President

714
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:52,800
Mr President, Mr President,
can you hear me?

715
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,600
I want her alone in a room. If there are
other KA's out there, I want her to talk.

716
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,280
She's trained not to talk,
no matter what we do to her.

717
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,959
If we're gonna find these people
must find them ourselves.

718
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,040
Somebody already did.

719
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,639
At least some of them, in the
East River. 12 dead, including Orlov.

720
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,480
Who did that?

721
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,120
I don't know. Forensics are on it.

722
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,839
Step back sir, please.

723
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,560
Please step back.

724
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,840
She attacked Winter sir.
You'd better get up here.

725
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,200
Sit down.

726
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,400
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

727
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,400
Then she's the FBI's.

728
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,100
Hey?

729
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,720
Why'd you kill him?

730
01:23:49,725 --> 01:23:51,240
Because somebody had to.

731
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,160
What?

732
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,960
By this I take it, you think
everybody's who they say they are.

733
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,160
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

734
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,280
So did I.

735
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,960
We just didn't know what it was.

736
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,560
Winter did.

737
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,500
Winter?

738
01:24:31,372 --> 01:24:34,275
You expect me to believe that Winter
was gonna launch the missiles 

739
01:24:34,395 --> 01:24:35,741
and you saved the world?

740
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,440
I would like you to believe that, yeah.

741
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,440
It's a big accusation.

742
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,480
Wow.

743
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,480
He's dead now so he
can't defend himself.

744
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,560
I guess you'll just have
to decide for yourself.

745
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,020
How many more like you are there?

746
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,360
Like me?

747
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,400
None.

748
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:08,200
Like him?

749
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,600
More than you or I can handle alone.

750
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,480
Do you really think, a trained
Soviet agent couldn't kill

751
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,480
the Russian President at point
blank range if she wanted to?

752
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,840
Or you, for that matter.

753
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,520
I could've killed you at
the funeral and I didn't.

754
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,759
You surrendered to me because
I gave you no choice.

755
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,080
You know better.

756
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,960
I had a choice.

757
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,520
You know better.

758
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:03,180
If I did believe you and I'm not
saying for a second that I do,

759
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,280
but if I did...

760
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,920
nobody else would.

761
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,360
Well, maybe you can think
of a way around that.

762
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,920
They took everything from me.

763
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,000
I'll kill them.

764
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,160
Bullshit!

765
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,160
We're approaching. Heading due south.

766
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,400
Go get 'em.

767
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,400
Salt!

768
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,400
Circle back!
Circle back!
