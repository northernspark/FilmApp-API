2
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,484
Grant us, Lord, the wisdom
and the grace to use right...

3
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,398
the time that is left to us
here on Earth.

4
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:30,530
Lead us to repent of our sins,
the evil we have done...

5
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,517
and the good we have not done.

6
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:37,140
And strengthen us to follow
the steps of Your son...

7
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:41,577
in the way that leads to
the fullness of eternal life.

8
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:45,185
For Jesus Christ, Our Lord,
Amen.

9
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,650
Amen.

10
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,475
Bastard!

11
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,585
Still owes me for a lobster.

12
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:22,849
It's like that David Bowie film:
"The Man Who Fell to Earth".

13
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:26,881
No, it's not! Trevethyn jumped
off a plane without a parachute.

14
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,982
- In the film, Bowie was an alien.
- "Is" an alien.

15
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,406
Don't start with that bollocks.

16
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,940
There are many people in
show biz that are from off-world.

17
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:38,680
Have you ever looked
into David Bowie's eyes?

18
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:42,420
By that same token, you could
say that Charlie was an alien.

19
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:44,137
Exactly!

20
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:48,031
- Charlie, more wine?
- Thanks, Grace.

21
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:51,901
- House looks lovely!
- Oh, thank you.

22
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,599
- Maurice?
- Yeah, thank you.

23
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:58,903
- Thank you, Grace.
- Thank you, Grace.

24
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:06,067
- Tongue. Sausage rolls in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

25
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,211
- Wash your hands.
- Okay.

26
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:12,125
Grace, who are you looking for?

27
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:14,517
Matthew, there you are!

28
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:19,345
Would you check the humidifier in
the greenhouse? I completely forgot.

29
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,259
It's done! I did it yesterday
when you asked me.

30
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:26,649
Don't know what I'd do without him.

31
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:34,088
What kind of injuries would someone
have if they fell from that height?

32
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,858
- Very bad ones.
- Why did he do it?

33
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,925
We don't really know.

34
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:44,090
Maybe he thought he was going to the
bathroom and picked the wrong door.

35
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,006
Yes, very likely.
Would you excuse me?

36
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:53,050
- I'm gonna get you!
- No, you're not! You can't catch me!

37
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,037
Matt.

38
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,356
- Have you got any?
- No. There's none about.

39
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:00,116
Matthew.

40
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:03,663
- Alright, come on.
- Good.

41
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,695
She's not here, Grace.

42
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:17,665
- Who's not here?
- She left just after the service.

43
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,492
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

44
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,671
- Do you think she'll leave?
- She loves it here.

45
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:39,803
Diana thinks it was an accident.
He was just looking for the lavatory.

46
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,586
I imagine he went
on the way down.

47
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,748
Is this the last of it?

48
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:49,937
Enjoy. It's gonna be
a long cold winter.

49
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,546
All right, Alfred?

50
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:54,459
- Hi, Dr. Bamford!
- Hi, Matthew.

51
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:57,534
I wonder if you could
do me a favor, doctor.

52
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,731
My ear needs to be
looked at again. It's still...

53
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:06,418
still giving me gyp. I'll pop
into the surgery tomorrow.

54
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:09,855
Okay. Well, I'd better be off.

55
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:14,291
There's reports of salmon
poachers out in the estuary.

56
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:19,727
You alright?

57
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,773
You have no idea.

58
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,384
My mom wanted to get
one of those dishwashers.

59
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:39,299
My dad said "no".
She's already got one. Him.

60
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:48,463
If there's anything I can do,
Grace, you know, in the house...

61
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:52,476
Well, everyone's been
very kind, but, really...

62
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:55,086
...I'm fine.
- I'll do that.

63
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:56,739
No, it's...

64
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,608
Harvey!

65
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:00,961
I'm fine.

66
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:03,153
Right-o.

67
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:56,844
- Morning, Matthew.
- Hi ya.

68
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:03,281
- Hello, Joyce.
- Good morning, Grace.

69
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,412
- Morning, Tom!
- Hello, Grace!

70
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:19,677
Good morning, ladies.

71
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:28,504
Morning, Grace.

72
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:33,896
I'd like a package of paracetamol
and I'd like to settle my account.

73
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,233
Oh, no... We've...

74
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,755
Lost our accounts. Why don't
you pay us next month?

75
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:40,769
- Lost the accounts?
- Yes.

76
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:43,466
It's very mysterious.

77
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:47,381
- I'll just take the paracetamol.
- Right so.

78
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,424
How much is that?

79
00:09:49,846 --> 00:09:52,046
Five pence.

80
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,948
No, it's Â£1,25 on the box.

81
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,165
Special offer.

82
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:01,993
Thank you.

83
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,515
Right. Thank you.

84
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:08,081
- Bye-bye now.
- Bye-bye.

85
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:43,658
I can extend the overdraft...

86
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:48,745
a bit. And maybe you can find out
if there's a life insurance policy.

87
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:52,659
- Investments.
- I don't understand, it's a mistake.

88
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:58,618
Your late husband used the house
as an asset to raise capital.

89
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,750
As you have no children,
you'll inherit the estate...

90
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,969
but you'll also inherit
the mortgage.

91
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:09,056
Fine. The house's 300 years old.
The mortgage must be paid off by now.

92
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:11,218
You don't understand.

93
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:16,711
He used the house as collateral
for loans to finance business deals.

94
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:20,277
None of which,
actually, took off.

95
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:23,843
- What about the money he left me?
- There isn't any.

96
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:28,497
And there are
the mortgage payments.

97
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,890
- How much are they?
- Two thousand pounds a month.

98
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,856
I'll be up your flu
in a minute or two

99
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,423
Cause I know where to find it

100
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,032
It's on your back
and it's called...

101
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,207
Hey, how are you doing?

102
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,077
Matthew, I've got some
bad news, I'm afraid.

103
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:22,595
I know.

104
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,820
- Have you tried plant food?
- I tried everything.

105
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,090
They died on purpose.
I even talk to them.

106
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,299
- What do you say?
- "Would you mind not dying?"

107
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:39,417
You really are
a crap gardener, Matthew.

108
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:41,953
What do I know about plants?
I'm from Glasgow!

109
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:45,419
- I hate this. I really hate this.
- Will somebody else do it?

110
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,044
- We're sea people.
- He's not. He's a doctor!

111
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,435
I don't have a fabulous record when
it comes to keeping things alive.

112
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:54,870
It's like the signs.

113
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,739
What signs?

114
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,741
Armageddon.

115
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:02,786
Final conflict.
A man falls from the sky...

116
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,612
you lose your job,
and all the plants are dying.

117
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:10,179
I meant to do that.

118
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:14,920
Do you have
a stock portfolio, perhaps?

119
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:17,964
- What's that?
- I don't know.

120
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,778
I just thought you might have one.

121
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:25,487
No, there's nothing like that. It's
just bills and letters of credit.

122
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:31,446
I don't understand. There are accounts
here of companies I haven't heard of.

123
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,491
We've got a Swiss bank account.

124
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:38,535
There's nothing in it,
but we do have one.

125
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:44,407
I'm sure there's something
tucked away somewhere.

126
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,146
That's what I thought, Gerald.

127
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,669
But no. No, there's not.

128
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,627
There's nothing!

129
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,280
What in God's name
am I going to do?

130
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:28,986
- Are you alright? You look peaky.
- I'm fine.

131
00:14:29,277 --> 00:14:33,290
- I've just a bad hangover.
- I can't remember if we drank much.

132
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,366
God, you're really ill.
You never get hangovers...

133
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:41,946
- I'll be fine once I get on the boat.
- You shouldn't go to work.

134
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,424
I think you should
see the doctor.

135
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:48,729
I can't see anyone
without an appointment.

136
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:52,471
- Tea?
- Yes, please!

137
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:57,458
Hey, what are you doing?
Get off! Get off of there!

138
00:14:57,558 --> 00:15:01,416
Given your recent troubles, we
rather thought you'd want to cancel.

139
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:03,939
It's only a tea party.
We could have it anywhere.

140
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,996
But we always have it here.
It's tradition.

141
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,344
I've been working
on a new hybrid.

142
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:13,694
"Phalanopsis pathopedilum."
It's beautiful!

143
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,608
Alright, ladies.
Back to business.

144
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:20,291
Do we invite Dr. Bamford...

145
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:23,784
given his disgraceful
display last year?

146
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,350
No! Come on, sir.
Off the mower!

147
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,611
- What's going on?
- Afternoon, Mrs. Trevethyn.

148
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:32,742
Hello, Bob. Terry.

149
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,396
- How's your mom's hip, Bob?
- Much better, thanks.

150
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:38,527
- Good, good.
- They wanna take the lawn mower.

151
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:44,919
It's the finance company.
There haven't been any payments.

152
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:50,182
Well, you'd better take it, then.

153
00:15:57,563 --> 00:16:00,011
I'm really sorry.

154
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:23,332
Matthew! Matthew,
you don't have to do this.

155
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:26,802
It's alright! You paid me
till the end of the week.

156
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:30,674
I don't believe he even lied
about the lawn mower.

157
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:35,197
He lied about everything.

158
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:49,665
- Can't you get a job?
- What could I do?

159
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,679
You could...

160
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,724
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

161
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,421
Matthew...

162
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:02,117
...I'm really sorry about your job.
- It's alright.

163
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,161
You're gonna have to get a goat.

164
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:10,206
- If there's anything else I can do.
- I was hoping you would say that.

165
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,597
- Why?
- Grace...

166
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:15,557
you are the best gardener
in the world.

167
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:19,253
I've got some plants
that are really sick.

168
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,558
- They desperately need help.
- Well, where are they?

169
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:26,328
What?

170
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,697
- Why are you whispering?
- I don't wanna wake up any squirrels.

171
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:55,002
Just through here. Here!

172
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:59,046
- Are these Gerald's plants?
- No, no. They're mine.

173
00:17:59,642 --> 00:18:02,223
I think I may have
over watered them.

174
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:09,832
I'm not stupid, Matthew.
I know what this is.

175
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,790
What is it?

176
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:15,400
- Hemp.
- Is it?

177
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:19,430
- Alright, it's hemp.
- They're not getting enough light.

178
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,618
They're never going to grow
in the dark down here.

179
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:25,794
- I didn't want anybody to see them.
- You wouldn't, would you?

180
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:31,534
For these poor things to grow, they
need some decent soil and better light.

181
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,970
Okay, thanks.

182
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,015
Come on, let's take one back to the
greenhouse, see what we can do.

183
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:45,591
You may not want to do that.

184
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,236
I'm a gardener.
These are sick plants.

185
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:50,953
Alright.

186
00:18:58,052 --> 00:19:00,891
- Look! There's Gerald!
- He won't see us. His eyes are bad.

187
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,674
Quick! Quick!

188
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:06,414
- Where have you been?
- It's brilliant, Nicky.

189
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,676
- I've saved the plants.
- How?

190
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:10,894
- I called in an expert.
- Who?

191
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:13,677
The best gardener in the world.

192
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:16,143
- Grace!
- Grace?

193
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:20,332
It's fantastic! It's compensation
for laying me off. Isn't that nice?

194
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,898
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

195
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,842
Hasn't she got enough problems
without getting into drugs?

196
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:30,684
- What are you talking about, drugs?
- You know what I'm talking about.

197
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:34,901
They're still illegal.
She's very vulnerable just now.

198
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:38,627
I hope you're not
taking advantage of her.

199
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:41,076
I'm doing this for us!

200
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:44,338
- Is this how you say "thanks"?
- No.

201
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,731
I've got a much better way.

202
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:51,502
Congratulations, Mr. Stuart.

203
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:54,995
You are tonight's
lucky Scotsman.

204
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:24,567
- Well, I either am or I'm not.
- No, no, you definitely are.

205
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:27,091
Pregnant indeed.

206
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:30,439
- Is that a good thing?
- Yes.

207
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:34,006
Yes, it's brilliant.

208
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:37,210
Any idea who the father is?

209
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,443
I think I know. I saw some of the
chromosomes had little kilts on.

210
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,053
Very funny.

211
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:47,647
I do have some bad news, though.

212
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,011
- What?
- There's a risk of ginger hair.

213
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:56,795
- Piss off.
- How are all our plants doing?

214
00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:00,100
He's called in an expert.

215
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:03,102
Sounds good.

216
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:09,146
Don't mention the baby yet. I wanna
tell him when the time is right.

217
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,625
What baby? Have a sweetie.

218
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:21,106
- Will she live, doctor?
- I think so.

219
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,630
- Where did these seeds come from?
- A guy in a pub in Bodmin.

220
00:21:26,574 --> 00:21:28,805
I mean what kind are they?

221
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,414
They're "Indicasativa" hybrids.

222
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:34,489
"Purple Haze" with "Early Pearl"
crossed with "Ruderalis".

223
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:38,285
But anyway, they're designed to
grow in a very sunny climate.

224
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:40,199
If you say so.

225
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,460
Is it the bud the bit
you're after?

226
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:47,971
Look.

227
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:56,726
- What is it?
- That's the start of a new bud.

228
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:01,205
You did that in 24 hours?

229
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:03,857
- You're a witch.
- It's not me, really.

230
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:06,467
It's just a question
of having enough light.

231
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:09,555
No light, no buds.
Simple.

232
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:15,427
- Yes?
- Is it alright if I park there?

233
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:16,826
- Yes.
- Dogs?

234
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:20,124
- Dogs?
- Dogs. Do you have dogs?

235
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:23,242
Postmen and surveyors.
Irresistible to our canine friends.

236
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,517
- No, there's no dogs.
- Good.

237
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:27,808
Yes, fabulous hall.

238
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:31,474
- Can I help you?
- No, no. I'm fine on my own.

239
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:35,346
- Tea is always nice.
- You've come to the wrong house.

240
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:38,042
I'm sorry, Nigel Plimpton.

241
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:40,956
Trevethyn? Liac House?

242
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,132
Evaluation for Ramptons
redebts outstanding.

243
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,045
It's a standard procedure before
a house is put up for auction.

244
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:50,438
But the house is not for auction.

245
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,395
I'm afraid it will be.

246
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,439
Here, look.

247
00:22:56,773 --> 00:23:00,426
People in your position often
stop opening their mail...

248
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:03,963
so I'm the first real proof
it's all happening.

249
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,660
I'll beg you to leave, please.

250
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:09,747
I'm sorry. I can't.

251
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:14,400
- I really must do this.
- I'd like you to leave as well.

252
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:19,881
Call the office to reschedule.

253
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,144
Thank you.

254
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:31,928
Ramptons is an enormous
investment trust.

255
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:35,525
John's syndicate
took a huge tumble.

256
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,540
I'd no idea he had
business interest in the city.

257
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,627
Yes, but how much do I owe them?

258
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:45,105
If you don't pay the money owing,
they can claim any or all...

259
00:23:45,397 --> 00:23:47,584
of your assets.

260
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:50,890
This, of course,
would include...

261
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:54,848
...the house.
- How much do I owe them, Melvyn?

262
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:57,848
300 thousand pounds.

263
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,155
Approximately.

264
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:43,187
Bastard!

265
00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:37,747
- Matthew?
- Yeah?

266
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:40,227
You know that plant...

267
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:42,836
I'm looking after for you?

268
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,011
- How much is it worth?
- It hasn't died, has it?

269
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,402
No, no, it's thriving!
I just...

270
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,100
wondered how much
you'd get for it.

271
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:57,536
Ounce for ounce, the really good
stuff is worth more than gold.

272
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:03,320
Greenhouse, now!

273
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,409
Here's what I think: we take
cuttings from the mother plant...

274
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:12,105
root them, grow them hydroponically
and go straight to budding.

275
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,341
We could have the first harvest
in a matter of weeks.

276
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:18,543
You could clear what you need in the
1st run and in the time you've got.

277
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,456
You haven't given it
any thought, then.

278
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:25,631
You can't tell anybody.

279
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:39,592
He just started.
We've got at least an hour.

280
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,378
- Sorry.
- You've done it all

281
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,161
You've broken every code

282
00:26:55,714 --> 00:27:00,816
Hold the rebel to the floor

283
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:07,947
You've spoiled the game
No matter what you say

284
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:13,950
For only metal
What a bore

285
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:18,081
Be reasonable.
That piece is worth that alone!

286
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:21,591
I'm being very fair, Mrs. T.
Very good price I'm giving you.

287
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:25,258
- It's daylight robbery!
- What else do you got?

288
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:32,220
Come and see me
Make me smile

289
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:35,044
Or do what you want

290
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:37,404
Run on wild

291
00:27:41,423 --> 00:27:43,923
There's nothing left

292
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:47,569
All gone and runaway

293
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,569
Maybe you'll tarry
For a while

294
00:27:53,121 --> 00:27:55,353
- Is it this blue one, Jack?
- That's right.

295
00:27:55,469 --> 00:28:00,268
It's just a test
A game for us to play

296
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:02,138
Hi, Grace.

297
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:05,878
- Hello, Nicky!
- I haven't seen you for days.

298
00:28:05,995 --> 00:28:08,575
- Are you okay?
- Yes! Busy.

299
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,836
What are you doing?

300
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:15,142
I'm building a fence.
Keep out the rabbits.

301
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:17,315
With electrical wire?

302
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:21,043
- It's an electric fence.
- Okay.

303
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:24,362
Is Matt up at the house? I just
gotta see him about something.

304
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:28,493
No, he's out. He's looking
for a transformer.

305
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:30,799
For the electric fence.

306
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:35,104
If you do see him, would you tell
him I'll meet him at the pub at 7?

307
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:36,931
Yeah, right-o.

308
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,628
- Bye!
- Bye!

309
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,066
Good book, is it?

310
00:28:55,532 --> 00:28:57,937
Oh, Jackie Collins.

311
00:28:59,142 --> 00:29:03,156
I'm reading a Kafka at the
moment. Not very funny.

312
00:29:03,753 --> 00:29:07,766
Except the one about a bloke that
turns into a beetle. Really wacky.

313
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:12,594
Wouldn't get anybody turning
into a beetle in a Jackie Collins.

314
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:16,030
You might get someone
sleeping with a beetle.

315
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,683
"He wrapped her up, in his
stick-like arms, all six of them...

316
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,598
tapping her sensuously
on the head...

317
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:29,773
with his wiggly wobbly aerials."

318
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,991
That's it. If he comes in now,
tell him I left in a huff.

319
00:29:36,196 --> 00:29:37,731
- Alright, love.
- Good night.

320
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:41,037
- Probably lying in your couch asleep.
- Yeah, you're right.

321
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:48,008
Sorry.

322
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:59,768
It gives me great pleasure to ask
Dame Reggae Spliff of Port Liac...

323
00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:02,478
to switch on this year's
illumination.

324
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:05,174
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

325
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:15,395
When I die
And they lay me to rest

326
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:18,613
Gonna go to the place that's the best

327
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:22,122
When they lay me down to die

328
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:26,659
Going up to the spirit in the sky

329
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:30,573
Going up to the spirit in the sky

330
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:36,314
- Where are you?
- Here we are...

331
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,967
I'm gonna go to a place that's best

332
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:55,101
They were up at the house,
I swear it.

333
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:07,162
I told you.

334
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:10,542
- That's a lot of light.
- Let's call the police...

335
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:12,541
and the RAF.
They'll wanna be included.

336
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:17,225
Let's just go back into the pub.
I wanna discuss something with you.

337
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:20,457
Are you out of your fucking mind?
We gotta save Grace!

338
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:24,067
I know what's causing the lights.
Just get back into the pub.

339
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:29,534
- Is it gonna blow?
- No, I don't think so.

340
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,548
That's it.

341
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:37,809
- Well, how do you know?
- I've seen it before in Amsterdam...

342
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:41,116
years ago, when I was on a medical
study, studying something medical.

343
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:44,378
- So that's her plan, then?
- From what Matt's been saying...

344
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:48,204
...and putting 2 and 2 together...
- It kinda warms the heart...

345
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:51,802
Grace carrying on the local tradition
of complete contempt for the law.

346
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:55,641
- Makes you proud.
- Did you try that stuff, doctor?

347
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,817
Once, at university.
Didn't inhale.

348
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:00,621
Evening.

349
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,022
- Evening.
- All right?

350
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,775
Drinking after hours, Charlie?

351
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:06,950
Private party, sergeant.

352
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:09,415
Lagaboollen. 16 year-old.

353
00:32:09,515 --> 00:32:14,038
Just a small one. Any of you noticed
those lights out towards Liac House?

354
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,809
- No.
- No.

355
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:18,257
- How's your ear?
- Any luck with those poachers?

356
00:32:18,374 --> 00:32:22,475
I'll get them, just a matter
of time. Crime never pays.

357
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:25,172
- Certainly not.
- Certainly.

358
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,956
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

359
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,957
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

360
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:38,654
Well, I'm glad we got that
cleared up.

361
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:42,526
I was working up at the house.
I lost track of time. Sorry.

362
00:32:42,686 --> 00:32:45,513
I waited for ages in the pub.
Didn't Grace tell you?

363
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:49,788
She did. I was really, really
busy. I'm really, really sorry.

364
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:53,993
- I've got something to tell you.
- Good, me too. Sit.

365
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:57,355
- Let me go first. It's really good.
- So is mine.

366
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,791
Right, you go first.

367
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:03,487
- No, you go first.
- Alright.

368
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,402
I'm moving the plants up to Liac House.
They're gonna grow quickly.

369
00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:09,987
There's a special way of growing
them. It's called "hydroponics".

370
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:13,187
Grace is a good gardener. We're
gonna get out of money problems.

371
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:16,013
- "We"?
- Me and Grace. Simple and perfect.

372
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:19,796
We sell it! And anything over what
she needs we split fifty-fifty.

373
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,189
Look, it's extreme, but it's smart.

374
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,755
I don't wanna leave here to get
work and this way I get to stay.

375
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:26,712
- Until you go to jail.
- I won't go to jail!

376
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:31,134
Smoking weed is one thing.
Large scale cultivation is another.

377
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:33,367
I'm surprised at Grace.
It's really stupid.

378
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:37,542
It's not stupid, it's smart. It'd
be different if it was your idea.

379
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:42,368
Right. When you're being chased in
the cell by a thief with a stiffy...

380
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:44,872
I'll be standing here thinking:
"Why couldn't it have been me?

381
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:47,501
Why couldn't I have had
that brilliant idea?"

382
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:50,381
You've been bleating on about how
sad you are about losing your job...

383
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:52,677
and what's your solution?
Crime!

384
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:55,635
You get in deeper and you
drag Grace down with you.

385
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,808
Matthew, you are such an idiot!

386
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,245
What's your news then?

387
00:34:05,928 --> 00:34:08,071
Doesn't matter.

388
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,561
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Trevethyn?

389
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:44,822
Quentin Rhodes here, from
Ramptons. It's about our surveyor.

390
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:48,518
"Velly solly.
Long rumba."

391
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:09,916
Get both of those.

392
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,265
So she sort of gets
through there, you see?

393
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:16,758
Right!

394
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:24,441
- Mrs. Trevethyn.
- Hello.

395
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,574
- Have you met my friend Tony?
- Hello.

396
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:31,357
My name is Tony.
I'm from Scandinavia.

397
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,489
Congratulations!

398
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:39,055
Tony, could you go and get one
of those giant bags of kitty litter?

399
00:35:41,913 --> 00:35:44,435
He doesn't talk much.

400
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:46,534
Does he have to?

401
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,754
Grace, have you read
any of my letters?

402
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:55,190
I'm sorry, no. But I'm
working on a little plan.

403
00:35:55,308 --> 00:35:59,366
It's a bit soon to talk about it
now, but I don't want to jinx it.

404
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:02,236
Grace, I can't do anymore
to hold them off.

405
00:36:02,398 --> 00:36:04,518
It's gone up to head office,
and they don't know you.

406
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:09,194
All they see is a middle-aged woman
with huge debts and no income!

407
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:13,152
- What are you going to do?
- I'm becoming a drugs dealer.

408
00:36:15,096 --> 00:36:18,241
Grace, I'm serious.

409
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:21,765
Thank you, Tony.
You will phone me, won't you?

410
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:23,938
- Yes, righty-o.
- Come on, Tony.

411
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,918
Honey Chambers?

412
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:47,658
44 Wilberforce Street,
London, South West Three.

413
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,138
He had me post his letters.

414
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:55,530
I never got any.

415
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,837
Would you like a drink?

416
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:13,274
- Do you have any children?
- No! I'm not very maternal.

417
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:15,437
I couldn't have any.

418
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:18,842
- No, I know.
- Gosh, you know a lot!

419
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:24,844
Can I ask you another question?

420
00:38:26,092 --> 00:38:28,062
If you want.

421
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:31,323
How did you cope with sex?

422
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:34,933
- Sex?
- Sex.

423
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:39,979
What a nightmare!

424
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,185
It was exhausting!

425
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:53,635
Oh, God, it was so frustrating!
Talk about flogging a dead horse!

426
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,644
No.

427
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:04,741
Not really.

428
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:07,075
What did you do then?

429
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:11,987
- We shouldn't be talking about that.
- Please, I'd like to know.

430
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:16,149
I...

431
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:23,905
- Ice cream.
- What? Pardon?

432
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:32,166
Ice cream. I sucked it from
his fingertips. It drove him wild.

433
00:39:34,982 --> 00:39:39,300
I had to pretend to pass out to get
any rest at all. He was insatiable.

434
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:52,565
I think he thought
you weren't interested.

435
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:55,349
He was wrong.

436
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:01,728
It's a beautiful house.

437
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:06,265
Yes. I think I'd like you
to leave now.

438
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:10,832
- He did love you.
- Don't patronize me.

439
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,007
Look, if you ever want to talk...

440
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:19,703
Yeah, I know the address.

441
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,494
Matthew...

442
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:51,148
Will you give me one?

443
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:54,266
What?

444
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:57,802
I want to know what it feels like.

445
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,580
Please.

446
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,476
Grace...

447
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:08,240
If I'm growing it and selling it,
I should know the effect it has.

448
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:12,805
- Oh, yeah! Of course you should.
- No, not here!

449
00:41:13,968 --> 00:41:16,503
Come on. Let's get it
over and done with.

450
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:25,419
Calm down!
There's no one about, relax.

451
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,906
I don't feel anything.

452
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:58,067
Slow down.

453
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:06,170
Is this addictive?

454
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:12,345
It's not crack.

455
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:24,567
Are you sure this works?

456
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:26,328
Oh, yes.

457
00:42:41,906 --> 00:42:44,094
- What?
- Nothing.

458
00:42:45,517 --> 00:42:47,717
What? What?

459
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,707
- What?
- It's you. You're Scottish!

460
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:07,623
Thank you.

461
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:41,806
God, I love it here.

462
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:44,372
You're feeling any better?

463
00:43:48,534 --> 00:43:51,984
Still feeling a little bit dizzy.

464
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:54,506
You're hungry?

465
00:43:54,623 --> 00:43:58,028
Oh, yes!
God, I haven't thought of that.

466
00:43:58,364 --> 00:44:00,725
I'm ravenous.

467
00:44:19,587 --> 00:44:22,514
What made you decide to do this?

468
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:26,733
44 Wilberforce Street, SW3.

469
00:44:50,206 --> 00:44:52,393
Mrs. Trevethyn?
Please, don't put the phone down.

470
00:44:54,294 --> 00:44:57,916
- Please, don't put the phone down.
- Problem?

471
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:02,700
I've been trying to get through
Mrs. Trevethyn for most of my life.

472
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,570
Phone, letters...

473
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,702
What is that woman
doing down there?

474
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:12,015
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She's been really moody recently.

475
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:14,965
- Maybe she just doesn't approve.
- Desperate times call for...

476
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:20,793
desperate measures. We could go
to Glasgow but she didn't want it.

477
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:23,793
My uncle Willie's got
a building site there.

478
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:26,142
- What does he build?
- Houses.

479
00:45:26,258 --> 00:45:27,881
- Round there.
- What?

480
00:45:34,697 --> 00:45:38,307
I play a good game,
but not as good as you

481
00:45:38,407 --> 00:45:42,568
I can be a little cold
but you can be so cruel

482
00:45:42,668 --> 00:45:46,539
I'm not made of brick
I'm not made of stone

483
00:45:46,655 --> 00:45:50,888
- But I had you fooled
- Five, four, three...

484
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:52,976
two, one...

485
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,457
Now the damage is done

486
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:07,545
There's blood in these veins
And I cry when in pain

487
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:11,198
I'm only human on the inside

488
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:15,635
And if looks could deceive
Make it hard to believe

489
00:46:15,795 --> 00:46:21,158
I'm only human on the inside

490
00:46:25,233 --> 00:46:29,365
I thought you'd come through
I thought he'd come clean

491
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:33,119
You were the best thing
I should never have seen

492
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,641
But you go to extremes
You pushed me too far

493
00:46:37,758 --> 00:46:42,121
Then you keep going
until you break my heart

494
00:46:43,064 --> 00:46:46,035
Yeah, you break my heart

495
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:50,166
See, I bleed and I bruise
But what's it to you?

496
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:53,212
I'm only human on the inside

497
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,852
- What do you want?
- I brought lunch.

498
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:02,475
Cornish pastries.
I'm kidding.

499
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,913
Fish. You brought me fish?

500
00:47:13,074 --> 00:47:15,696
I thought it 'd be a nice change.

501
00:47:17,249 --> 00:47:20,394
What are you doing here?
You never come on the boat.

502
00:47:20,945 --> 00:47:25,178
I was wondering what you looked
like. I go to bed when you get up.

503
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:28,439
- It's the tides.
- It's not the tides.

504
00:47:28,948 --> 00:47:31,308
- I don't like what you're doing.
- I know.

505
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,063
I don't wanna be in a relationship
with someone who's irresponsible.

506
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:36,515
Yes, you do. I have been
irresponsible my whole life!

507
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:39,051
- Well, it's time you changed.
- Why?

508
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,734
You're getting old!

509
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:44,573
I'm not getting old.
These are laugh lines.

510
00:47:44,952 --> 00:47:47,401
Nothing is that funny.

511
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,402
I don't understand. I thought
you liked me the way I am.

512
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:51,606
I do.

513
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:55,577
But things change and
you have to change with them.

514
00:47:55,694 --> 00:47:58,926
Fish and chips.
Fantastic!

515
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:07,364
In a few minutes, Tim Buxton'll be
here with more fun in the afternoon.

516
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,669
First, it's 12 o'clock.
Time for the news headline.

517
00:48:11,396 --> 00:48:15,018
Police are celebrating a major
victory in the war on drugs today.

518
00:48:15,222 --> 00:48:18,613
Two men and one woman were found
guilty at Bristol Crown Court...

519
00:48:18,713 --> 00:48:22,454
after police discovered marijuana
with an estimated street value...

520
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:26,238
of half a million pounds hidden
in a barn on their family farm.

521
00:48:26,356 --> 00:48:30,153
Sentencing them to 15 year
jail sentences, the judge...

522
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:20,950
- Hello!
- Yeah...

523
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:24,516
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

524
00:49:24,808 --> 00:49:28,345
I just wondered. You didn't
come into the pub last night.

525
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,953
I'm not drinking at the moment.

526
00:49:34,593 --> 00:49:36,694
Are you angry with me?

527
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:40,304
No, I'm angry at Matthew.
It's his fault.

528
00:49:40,465 --> 00:49:42,304
It was my decision to do it.

529
00:49:43,378 --> 00:49:44,871
I'm trying to save my house.

530
00:49:45,336 --> 00:49:49,393
Everybody knows what you're doing.
Soon you'll have the police there.

531
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:51,308
They'll never find out.

532
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:54,831
Your greenhouse lights up like
a space ship. People aren't stupid.

533
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:59,048
- Anyway, we're nearly done now.
- He could be in jail by tomorrow.

534
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:07,573
Why aren't you drinking?

535
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:10,660
I just don't feel like it.

536
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:16,054
He doesn't know, does he?

537
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:25,664
How can I help?

538
00:50:26,348 --> 00:50:28,927
Don't let him go to jail.

539
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,758
Our mutant buds will soon
be ready, great one!

540
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,887
We can release them
into the atmosphere...

541
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:49,020
and take over the entire planet!

542
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,544
Do you realize what we have
done here? This is fabulous!

543
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,326
It's time for me to go to London
and get a dealer.

544
00:50:57,662 --> 00:51:00,458
No, you are not.
You're staying here, I'm going.

545
00:51:00,619 --> 00:51:03,067
- What?
- It's my decision.

546
00:51:04,316 --> 00:51:06,634
I don't think you realize
what you're dealing with here.

547
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:10,373
You were in London 5 years ago
for the Chelsea Flower Show.

548
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,809
You can't sell this stuff
to a florist.

549
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:14,839
What's your master plan then?

550
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:20,464
I'd go to Portobello Rd. or Notting
Hill, find a dealer and sell it.

551
00:51:20,973 --> 00:51:23,073
- That's your plan? That's it?
- Yeah.

552
00:51:23,191 --> 00:51:26,292
- Rubbish.
- You've got nothing!

553
00:51:26,408 --> 00:51:31,250
A drug dealer take one look at you and
know there's something fishy going on.

554
00:51:31,412 --> 00:51:35,511
With all due respect, I'm the hip one.
You're more hip replacement.

555
00:51:36,804 --> 00:51:39,468
One more word, and I'm gonna
throw the whole lot into the sea.

556
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,774
- You're not thinking this through.
- I mean it.

557
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:44,253
You are not the boss of me.
We're partners!

558
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:46,603
The checks bounced, remember?

559
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:50,169
Women like cuddly toys,
don't they?

560
00:51:50,285 --> 00:51:54,822
They like to hug and squeeze them,
poke their eyes and rip their limbs.

561
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:00,085
I avoid confrontation, I know it.

562
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:03,258
But if you grew up in Glasgow
in the 70's, you'd do the same.

563
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:06,564
All I want is an easy life. Grow
some vegetables, smoke a reefer...

564
00:52:06,725 --> 00:52:08,260
sing some carols
at Christmas time.

565
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:12,523
One day, I'd like to be a dad and
raise a couple of calm children.

566
00:52:12,684 --> 00:52:16,699
That's it, I've fucking had enough.
I'm gone. No more Mr. Cuddly Toy...

567
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:20,961
or whipping boy for Ganja Grace
and Cap. Nicky, the lobster queen.

568
00:52:21,078 --> 00:52:23,570
I'm fucking gone! I'm gone!
I'm fucking out of here!

569
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:27,571
Before that, I'm gonna see both of them
and give them a piece of my mind.

570
00:52:29,863 --> 00:52:31,746
Are you done?

571
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:36,746
Good shot.

572
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:06,120
Get out!

573
00:54:07,717 --> 00:54:08,917
Moron!

574
00:54:23,896 --> 00:54:28,723
Can I show you something privately?
It's ever so nice.

575
00:54:28,823 --> 00:54:30,518
Come on, let's go.

576
00:54:39,422 --> 00:54:42,915
- Can I show you?
- I don't know who you are.

577
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:46,003
I'm not interested...

578
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:48,808
Come on.

579
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:51,426
Come here!

580
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,832
I've got something really tasty.

581
00:54:55,383 --> 00:54:58,406
Are you looking for something?
Know what I mean?

582
00:54:58,506 --> 00:55:00,572
Alright, love. Hop in.

583
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:02,846
Hello!

584
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,574
Excuse me. Yo!

585
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,371
I love it here. It's so quiet.

586
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:59,067
If you think this is quiet,
you should see Evensong.

587
00:55:59,968 --> 00:56:02,765
I wish I were
a Catholic sometimes.

588
00:56:02,882 --> 00:56:07,752
Incense, nice costumes...
A lot to be said for it, really.

589
00:56:07,852 --> 00:56:10,853
They have confession too.

590
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,641
I've got some friends...

591
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:27,085
and I think they're going
to get into a lot of trouble.

592
00:56:27,185 --> 00:56:29,859
And I don't know what to do.

593
00:56:29,977 --> 00:56:32,643
Don't suppose you can go
to the police?

594
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:35,427
I thought not.

595
00:56:35,543 --> 00:56:38,340
If you have to commit crime...

596
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:40,861
to get what you want...

597
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:43,820
then you're not meant to have it.

598
00:56:44,024 --> 00:56:48,039
I don't know if I'm worried more
for them or worried for myself.

599
00:56:48,373 --> 00:56:52,736
If one has a problem that
seems to be unsolvable...

600
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:57,651
than perhaps one shouldn't try
to solve it, one should accept it.

601
00:56:57,856 --> 00:57:01,608
- What do you mean?
- "God, grant me the serenity...

602
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:04,043
to accept the things
I cannot change...

603
00:57:04,248 --> 00:57:07,291
courage to change
the things I can...

604
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,871
and the wisdom
to know the difference."

605
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:14,177
The wisdom is the hard part.

606
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:25,744
I like Matthew.
He's a good soul...

607
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,398
for a Scotsman.

608
00:57:40,432 --> 00:57:42,346
What on Earth did you think
you were doing?

609
00:57:42,446 --> 00:57:46,448
You can't hang around pubs this way.
You're bound to get into trouble.

610
00:57:46,565 --> 00:57:50,361
If you're trying to meet a man,
I know so much better places.

611
00:57:50,478 --> 00:57:53,276
I wasn't trying to meet a man!

612
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:57,263
Keep walking.

613
00:57:57,363 --> 00:58:00,190
- Go on, you'll be arrested.
- We need to talk!

614
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,638
- Have you seen Nicky?
- No. Where the hell have you been?

615
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:11,115
Grace had to get Harvey
to watch the plants.

616
00:58:11,215 --> 00:58:13,107
- What?
- I took her to the station.

617
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:15,630
- She's gone to London.
- Fuck!

618
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:20,283
Where are we going?

619
00:58:21,052 --> 00:58:24,110
44 Wilberforce Street, SW3.

620
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:35,288
Ask your Scottish friend to help.
He'd know better how to go about it.

621
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:39,073
His girlfriend is pregnant.
He can't get into trouble.

622
00:58:40,754 --> 00:58:43,986
I just want you to ring
a dealer, that's all.

623
00:58:44,407 --> 00:58:48,682
- It's mad. You'll end up in jail.
- I'm not going to give up.

624
00:58:49,584 --> 00:58:52,119
Call a dealer.

625
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:57,860
How do you know that I know one?

626
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:10,863
On one condition: that you let me
lend you an outfit that's...

627
00:59:11,851 --> 00:59:13,651
not that.

628
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,424
- Kelly?
- Sir?

629
00:59:41,524 --> 00:59:43,352
Give times of trains
to Cornwall tomorrow.

630
00:59:43,468 --> 00:59:45,047
Yes, sir.

631
00:59:45,557 --> 00:59:48,557
Draw, spliff...

632
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:51,089
puff...

633
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:54,311
...shit.
- Yes, thank you.

634
00:59:54,993 --> 00:59:57,529
Call it what you will...

635
00:59:57,647 --> 01:00:01,922
but, as my belief,
it is the door to enlightenment.

636
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:07,793
- In your own time.
- And now, the acid test.

637
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,027
Jesus!

638
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:30,974
I'll give you 60 for it.

639
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:36,324
- Don't be silly.
- 70?

640
01:00:37,484 --> 01:00:41,138
That's just a sample.
I've got 20 kilos.

641
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:43,718
20 kilos, Grace!

642
01:00:44,877 --> 01:00:48,587
You've caught the wrong man.
I'm on a limited operation.

643
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:54,272
- You're talking big leagues!
- Well, you just got promoted.

644
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:56,446
I don't have that kind of money.

645
01:00:56,546 --> 01:00:59,156
Well, do you know
anybody who does?

646
01:01:00,013 --> 01:01:02,201
I've heard of someone.

647
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,335
Call him.

648
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:09,637
He's a bit heavy. He's not
like us. He's not...

649
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:11,797
Laid back.

650
01:01:12,029 --> 01:01:13,829
Call him.

651
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:22,293
- Come on, Honey!
- There she is.

652
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:25,063
- You don't know who the guy is.
- I don't care who the guy is.

653
01:01:25,163 --> 01:01:27,830
He may be a drug dealer. You can't
wander into something like that.

654
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,408
- Why have you got so bossy?
- You are so fucking insensitive!

655
01:01:30,508 --> 01:01:32,661
- That could be dangerous!
- They're getting away now!

656
01:01:32,762 --> 01:01:34,905
Follow them, you dozy quack!

657
01:02:19,515 --> 01:02:22,168
Just like a window display
at Harvey Nicks.

658
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:24,443
There's a rave tonight.
We hold them here.

659
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,704
- What's a rave?
- Grace!

660
01:02:35,216 --> 01:02:39,708
- What have you brought me, China?
- Two ladies and a fucking hippie.

661
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:42,708
What do they want?

662
01:02:59,005 --> 01:03:01,453
"Touche! Sur la tete!"

663
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:11,617
- You like to fish?
- Where I live, the fishing is wonderful.

664
01:03:11,717 --> 01:03:13,762
I hate it here.

665
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,631
The fishing is terrible.

666
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:18,806
I should visit you.

667
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:20,938
Where do you live?

668
01:03:23,446 --> 01:03:25,764
What's your name?

669
01:03:26,361 --> 01:03:27,561
Grace.

670
01:03:28,622 --> 01:03:30,158
Perfect.

671
01:03:31,406 --> 01:03:32,606
Hello!

672
01:03:33,754 --> 01:03:34,954
Grace?

673
01:03:36,886 --> 01:03:39,247
Funny smell.

674
01:03:41,495 --> 01:03:43,204
Who's that?

675
01:03:43,801 --> 01:03:46,249
Harvey.
Where's Grace?

676
01:03:46,366 --> 01:03:49,423
We've come to finalize the details
of the Women's Institute visit.

677
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:53,382
Grace invited us to supper.
It was arranged ages ago!

678
01:03:53,674 --> 01:03:57,818
- You gotta get out.
- No, we have to speak to Grace.

679
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,775
No, you have to leave.
It's the plants, you see?

680
01:04:01,937 --> 01:04:04,676
They're very delicate.
They're special orchids from Peru.

681
01:04:04,776 --> 01:04:06,807
These aren't orchids.

682
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:10,170
- Aren't they?
- No! They look more like tea.

683
01:04:10,286 --> 01:04:14,330
Tea, what a good idea.
Let's go in the kitchen...

684
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:17,441
...and I'll make you a cup of tea.
- I was expecting supper.

685
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:19,769
There's some ham left over,
I can knock you up a sandwich.

686
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:21,659
What's that funny smell?

687
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:25,174
It's probably the ham. It's been
left out a bit, but it's okay.

688
01:04:34,381 --> 01:04:36,524
Where did you get it?

689
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:39,774
The people I represent wish
to remain anonymous.

690
01:04:39,874 --> 01:04:41,474
Oh, yes.

691
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:45,615
The people I represent wish
to remain anonymous as well.

692
01:04:45,906 --> 01:04:48,660
Maybe they are the same people.

693
01:04:48,952 --> 01:04:52,399
Can I go now? I've got to pick up
my daughter at the flute practice.

694
01:04:55,603 --> 01:04:57,387
How much do you have?

695
01:04:57,487 --> 01:04:59,661
A lot. Are you buying?

696
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:03,128
Why don't I just take it?

697
01:05:03,228 --> 01:05:05,577
You don't know where it is.

698
01:05:05,738 --> 01:05:08,346
I'm sure I can get you to tell me.

699
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:13,753
What if I cut a few fingers one by
one until you change your mind?

700
01:05:16,568 --> 01:05:19,840
Nobody move! I'm the police!
The whole place is surrounded!

701
01:05:23,395 --> 01:05:25,365
- And you would be?
- Hello, everyone.

702
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:29,279
Martin Bamford.
Are we too early for the rave?

703
01:05:29,484 --> 01:05:32,889
I can't wait.
I just love raving.

704
01:05:33,093 --> 01:05:36,935
- This has nothing to do with me.
- Shut up, beardy-weirdy.

705
01:05:37,096 --> 01:05:40,022
- Who's this guy?
- That's my doctor.

706
01:05:41,444 --> 01:05:43,109
This one?

707
01:05:43,227 --> 01:05:45,066
He's my gardener.

708
01:05:46,532 --> 01:05:50,503
- Nice. Expecting anyone else?
- No.

709
01:05:50,794 --> 01:05:53,242
Your cleaning lady, perhaps?

710
01:05:54,012 --> 01:05:56,101
- No, no one else.
- Very well...

711
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:58,275
This is China,
he beats people up for me.

712
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:00,898
- Shall l...
- No, please...

713
01:06:01,189 --> 01:06:04,899
Matthew, take Dr. Bamford and
Honey and wait for me outside.

714
01:06:05,581 --> 01:06:06,981
Please.

715
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:10,678
Please.

716
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:20,847
Excuse me.

717
01:06:24,152 --> 01:06:27,471
- Grace...
- Wait for me outside.

718
01:06:30,894 --> 01:06:33,038
Shall I go too?

719
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:51,042
Sit down, please.

720
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:05,208
All the people I deal with are...

721
01:07:05,308 --> 01:07:06,308
scum.

722
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:11,222
I'm a little scummy myself.
You are not scum.

723
01:07:11,688 --> 01:07:15,137
- That worries me.
- I take exception to that.

724
01:07:15,255 --> 01:07:18,095
I come from a long line of scum.

725
01:07:18,342 --> 01:07:22,922
My late husband was the scummiest
man to walk the face of the Earth.

726
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:26,444
- My apologies.
- Yes, let's get to it, shall we?

727
01:07:26,997 --> 01:07:29,314
Three and a half a kilo.

728
01:07:29,433 --> 01:07:32,838
20 kg in the first week
and then 10 kg two weeks later.

729
01:07:33,389 --> 01:07:36,273
After that, we can do
20 kg every four weeks.

730
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,479
Three for a kilo. And no more deals
until I see the first batch.

731
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:44,537
- Three and a quarter.
- Done.

732
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:47,755
Thank you!

733
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,974
You're welcome.

734
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:57,322
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

735
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:03,239
I can't believe
your friend fainted.

736
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:09,588
Do I look like I would
cut someone's finger off?

737
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:17,502
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.

738
01:08:25,014 --> 01:08:28,449
- You're going to be alright?
- Never felt better, Honey.

739
01:08:28,549 --> 01:08:30,637
Now, headache pills
and straight to bed.

740
01:08:30,755 --> 01:08:33,290
- Don't go over any bumps.
- Good luck!

741
01:08:34,365 --> 01:08:36,465
Come on, boys.

742
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:41,857
What do you think?

743
01:08:42,148 --> 01:08:43,988
I'm not sure.

744
01:08:45,194 --> 01:08:47,151
Follow them.

745
01:08:47,251 --> 01:08:49,644
What do I do with the hippie?

746
01:08:53,848 --> 01:08:55,644
Take him.

747
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:01,256
My old lady is expecting me. We're
having "Dungeons and Dragons" night.

748
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:07,865
It's the regional final.

749
01:09:08,027 --> 01:09:10,332
If that knife had slipped,
I'd be a dead man.

750
01:09:10,432 --> 01:09:13,115
It 'd be a dead body driving
this car back to Cornwall.

751
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:15,781
Don't be so stupid.
He was bluffing.

752
01:09:16,334 --> 01:09:19,043
As long as we have the
merchandise, we have the power.

753
01:09:19,161 --> 01:09:23,088
Do I know you? What are you talking
about "merchandise and power"?

754
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:26,119
Look at the way you're dressed.
You're like Ma fucking Baker!

755
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:28,220
- Language!
- Don't you "Language" me!

756
01:09:28,337 --> 01:09:31,642
- I nearly got my throat cut for you!
- You weren't supposed to be here.

757
01:09:31,742 --> 01:09:34,917
Fine! Do it yourself with
Jacques fucking Cousteau then!

758
01:09:35,035 --> 01:09:36,786
- I'm out!
- What?

759
01:10:10,785 --> 01:10:14,351
I can't find Grace's plants
anywhere.

760
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:17,713
This tea has the most
extraordinary aroma.

761
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:19,495
Darjeeling?

762
01:10:19,655 --> 01:10:21,234
Trevethyn.

763
01:10:21,352 --> 01:10:23,570
Oh, Diana, you never...

764
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:27,411
Just a little cutting.
I do love fresh tea.

765
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:30,543
So do I, dear.
Give it here.

766
01:10:34,574 --> 01:10:36,284
That's lovely.

767
01:10:50,188 --> 01:10:52,506
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

768
01:10:58,929 --> 01:11:01,930
How else am I gonna
get the money?

769
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:04,030
I don't know.

770
01:11:05,801 --> 01:11:07,858
It's Nicky.

771
01:11:07,975 --> 01:11:11,411
She doesn't want a relationship
with someone irresponsible.

772
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:15,034
And I don't want a relationship
with someone who isn't Nicky.

773
01:11:17,803 --> 01:11:20,514
That's better.
Ready for my breakfast now.

774
01:11:20,631 --> 01:11:22,231
Come on!

775
01:11:38,202 --> 01:11:40,519
For Christ's sake!

776
01:11:40,636 --> 01:11:44,477
Okay, we harvest the plants and
we get the stuff up to London...

777
01:11:44,595 --> 01:11:47,566
...and we never do it again!
- Thank you.

778
01:11:48,422 --> 01:11:51,871
We do it quick as well. I don't
want another knife on my throat.

779
01:11:53,771 --> 01:11:58,525
You know, this is the site
of the new proposed B-323.

780
01:11:58,644 --> 01:12:02,047
Due for completion early 2004.

781
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,339
I can't believe you lost them!
How could you've lost them?

782
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:08,007
It's not as if there's
a lot of traffic out there!

783
01:12:08,559 --> 01:12:10,529
I'm sorry, right?

784
01:12:10,646 --> 01:12:15,038
I'm not a career criminal.
I don't have tailing abilities.

785
01:12:15,138 --> 01:12:18,836
Are you getting lippy with me?
Don't start getting lippy with me!

786
01:12:19,866 --> 01:12:22,446
What? I'm just trying
to make the best of it.

787
01:12:22,562 --> 01:12:26,737
Since we came all the way here,
we might as well enjoy the day out.

788
01:12:26,837 --> 01:12:30,404
Get in the car.
Just shut up and get in the car!

789
01:12:30,566 --> 01:12:35,405
You need to sort out some anger
management when you get home.

790
01:12:37,305 --> 01:12:38,705
Harvey?

791
01:12:41,134 --> 01:12:44,656
You forgot your meeting with the
WI. They were in the greenhouse...

792
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:48,106
It's alright, I bluffed them.
And Nicky was here.

793
01:12:49,091 --> 01:12:51,179
What did you tell her?

794
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:55,398
That you went to London with Dr.
Bamford help Grace sell the drugs.

795
01:12:55,498 --> 01:12:58,616
- Shit! Grace, I have to go see her.
- That's alright, don't worry.

796
01:12:58,716 --> 01:13:01,413
Harvey and I will start
on the greenhouse.

797
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,588
Come on, Harvey.

798
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:08,228
Thanks. Do you know where
Liac House is? Mrs. Trevethyn?

799
01:13:08,328 --> 01:13:10,381
- No.
- I'll ask around.

800
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:12,199
- Try the shop.
- Keep the change.

801
01:13:12,317 --> 01:13:13,917
Right-o.

802
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,939
Thank you.

803
01:13:32,365 --> 01:13:34,596
Hello! Anybody home?

804
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:37,742
Hello?

805
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:52,893
May I help you?

806
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:08,476
Would you like some Corn Flakes?
They're heavenly.

807
01:14:09,767 --> 01:14:12,303
No, thank you.
I've already eaten.

808
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:34,441
Would you like
a chocolate ice cream?

809
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:40,311
I'm looking for Liac House.
I want to contact Grace Trevethyn.

810
01:14:41,299 --> 01:14:45,096
I love Grace.
I really, really love her.

811
01:14:45,692 --> 01:14:47,954
She's an angel.

812
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:50,663
She has wonderful hair...

813
01:14:50,868 --> 01:14:55,664
soft and silky,
like a lovely angora rabbit.

814
01:14:58,174 --> 01:14:59,374
Right.

815
01:15:00,566 --> 01:15:04,144
- Where do I find her?
- She lives...

816
01:15:04,741 --> 01:15:07,612
in a lovely, lovely house.

817
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:12,351
- I love her.
- How do I get to the lovely house?

818
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:15,105
Up the lovely, lovely hill.

819
01:15:15,526 --> 01:15:19,845
Lovely, lovely, lovely

820
01:15:21,528 --> 01:15:24,542
One, two, three, now.

821
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:29,903
Nicky!

822
01:15:35,315 --> 01:15:36,515
Nicky!

823
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:42,057
Nicky, I'm sorry
I did something illegal.

824
01:15:42,157 --> 01:15:45,025
- I'm gonna get a proper job!
- What?

825
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:48,331
I'm ready to be responsible!

826
01:15:49,188 --> 01:15:53,507
- I love you!
- I can't hear you! What did you say?

827
01:15:53,668 --> 01:15:55,856
I love you!

828
01:15:56,408 --> 01:15:59,727
I love you! I'm pregnant!

829
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:04,424
- What?
- I'm having a baby!

830
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:18,254
No, no! Get out of the water!
You're pregnant!

831
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:27,344
No, no! You can't swim!
You're pregnant!

832
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,662
Mrs. Trevethyn?

833
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:16,976
It's Quentin Rhodes.

834
01:17:17,076 --> 01:17:21,403
I can't see that person. Not now,
you've got to get rid of him.

835
01:17:21,522 --> 01:17:25,130
- What do I say?
- I don't know. Tell him anything.

836
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:29,491
Tell him I'm still in London, I've
been kidnapped by aliens, anything!

837
01:17:33,045 --> 01:17:35,059
- Charlie, whiskey!
- Thank God.

838
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:38,190
I've been trying to reach you at
the house. No one answer the phone!

839
01:17:38,308 --> 01:17:40,451
- What's wrong?
- There were two men here.

840
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:45,020
Londoners. Asking about Grace.
I thought, maybe, Customs.

841
01:17:45,136 --> 01:17:46,136
Fuck!

842
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:57,748
- That's them.
- Oh, shit!

843
01:17:57,848 --> 01:17:59,370
- What?
- They're no Customs.

844
01:17:59,487 --> 01:18:02,501
- They're drug dealers from London.
- So I was right about London.

845
01:18:02,619 --> 01:18:06,634
We'll go up to the house. Nicky,
meet us there with Dr. Bamford.

846
01:18:11,405 --> 01:18:13,809
Give this to me!
What's the matter with you?

847
01:18:13,927 --> 01:18:16,853
Get up there! How many times
have I gotta tell you?

848
01:18:20,234 --> 01:18:21,942
- Alfred.
- What is it?

849
01:18:22,102 --> 01:18:25,334
The two men who own this car,
they were just in the pub.

850
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:29,367
I overheard them talking about how
much they enjoy salmon poaching.

851
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:30,867
Really?

852
01:18:31,511 --> 01:18:36,251
Thank you, Nicky. There could be
a community service for you.

853
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:39,947
Thanks, I've gotta go.
I'm pregnant.

854
01:18:40,109 --> 01:18:42,644
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

855
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:49,080
- What are they doing here?
- They're not on holiday, Grace.

856
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:51,764
- But Jacques said a week.
- Well, he lied.

857
01:18:51,864 --> 01:18:54,721
- Quentin Rhodes is here.
- Who the fuck is Quentin Rhodes?

858
01:18:54,821 --> 01:18:56,896
Harvey is holding him off.
What are we gonna do?

859
01:18:56,996 --> 01:18:59,936
Let's just get rid of this stuff
and get this thing over with, okay?

860
01:19:04,028 --> 01:19:05,228
Jesus!

861
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:20,220
Up the hill,
second house on the left.

862
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:33,559
5-7 to base.
Suspects under surveillance.

863
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:35,441
Copy that.
On our way.

864
01:19:43,084 --> 01:19:45,140
Mrs. Trevethyn!

865
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:50,752
I've just come to warn you there are
2 men who are part of a salmon...

866
01:19:57,174 --> 01:19:59,175
It's parsley.

867
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:01,928
It's marijuana, isn't it?

868
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:04,280
Yes.

869
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:09,178
I knew you and Matthew were
growing it, but I had no idea.

870
01:20:09,278 --> 01:20:12,310
- You knew?
- I live around here, don't I?

871
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:16,485
But with your financial problems,
I thought I'd turn a blind eye...

872
01:20:16,585 --> 01:20:19,106
to a bit of homegrown.

873
01:20:19,223 --> 01:20:23,544
But, Grace, this is a huge amount.

874
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:31,837
It's good stuff too. Better than
the shit you grew at the vicarage.

875
01:20:31,937 --> 01:20:33,982
You knew about that?

876
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:38,244
Alfred, in a few minutes,
we'll have got rid of it.

877
01:20:38,578 --> 01:20:41,854
Can't you turn your blind eye
just a little bit longer?

878
01:20:42,275 --> 01:20:47,494
It's not me, it's the officers
from Coldock H.Q. which worry me.

879
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:50,943
- Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
- If I were you...

880
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:55,075
I'd get rid of this stuff quick.
I'm gonna go look for poachers.

881
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,600
Excuse me a moment.

882
01:21:33,768 --> 01:21:36,433
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

883
01:21:36,552 --> 01:21:38,347
He asked first.

884
01:21:38,508 --> 01:21:42,784
I'm here to do some business
with Mrs. Trevethyn.

885
01:21:45,206 --> 01:21:47,206
So are we.

886
01:21:47,524 --> 01:21:48,924
Really?

887
01:21:49,903 --> 01:21:53,049
Are you interested in buying
the property or do you have...

888
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:55,449
a claim on it in some way?

889
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:57,485
What is this?

890
01:22:03,343 --> 01:22:05,704
Well, there it is.

891
01:22:06,126 --> 01:22:08,126
We did it.

892
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:11,227
We did, didn't we?

893
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:15,664
There's another 2 men here.
What are we gonna do?

894
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,752
- Skin up.
- Even you can't smoke all of it.

895
01:22:18,912 --> 01:22:23,143
- I could try.
- Maybe no one should have the stuff.

896
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,080
Alright.

897
01:22:30,002 --> 01:22:32,754
- Thank you, Matthew.
- You're welcome, Grace.

898
01:22:34,134 --> 01:22:36,627
Put that match out!

899
01:22:37,093 --> 01:22:40,353
Look, I have no idea
what's going on but...

900
01:22:40,453 --> 01:22:42,672
I think you'd better put it out.

901
01:22:43,572 --> 01:22:48,674
That's the most beautiful
and awesome thing I've ever seen.

902
01:22:52,183 --> 01:22:54,718
Hello, Mrs. Trevethyn.
I hope we're not too early.

903
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:56,980
Who the hell are you?

904
01:23:01,447 --> 01:23:02,447
Shit.

905
01:23:08,753 --> 01:23:12,073
Look, ladies.
No, ladies, no, no!

906
01:23:12,189 --> 01:23:15,072
- Come on, make a run for it.
- What about you?

907
01:23:15,233 --> 01:23:17,247
Don't worry about me.
I can handle this.

908
01:23:17,407 --> 01:23:19,247
No, we did this together.
I'm staying.

909
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:24,293
I love you both very much indeed.
But, Matthew, you're fired.

910
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:26,010
Come on.

911
01:23:45,111 --> 01:23:47,168
Get off! Get off!

912
01:23:47,287 --> 01:23:49,887
Get that man!

913
01:23:50,288 --> 01:23:52,766
What are you arresting me for?

914
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:55,911
No, madam! Stop there! Right...

915
01:24:18,165 --> 01:24:20,179
Hello, Grace.

916
01:24:40,476 --> 01:24:42,737
I trusted you.

917
01:24:42,837 --> 01:24:45,717
Whatever happened
to honor amongst thieves?

918
01:24:45,817 --> 01:24:49,753
- What about our deal?
- It's nice to see you too.

919
01:24:49,914 --> 01:24:51,971
You can't even do
your own dirty work.

920
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:54,623
- Dirty work?
- Why did you send in your boys?

921
01:24:54,783 --> 01:24:57,046
To keep an eye on you.

922
01:24:57,146 --> 01:25:00,102
To stop you from coming
to any harm.

923
01:25:00,307 --> 01:25:03,409
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- It's the truth.

924
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,062
I hope I haven't spoiled
everything.

925
01:25:18,356 --> 01:25:20,848
Are you trying to escape?

926
01:25:22,835 --> 01:25:27,285
- Maybe I could help.
- No, thank you.

927
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:35,157
Mrs. Trevethyn!

928
01:25:35,711 --> 01:25:36,911
Grace!

929
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:42,377
Those fingers through my hair

930
01:25:42,494 --> 01:25:46,377
That sly come hither stare

931
01:25:46,757 --> 01:25:52,076
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

932
01:25:54,846 --> 01:25:58,948
And I've got no defense for it

933
01:25:59,064 --> 01:26:03,035
The heat is too intense for it

934
01:26:03,196 --> 01:26:07,689
What good would
common sense for it do?

935
01:26:10,067 --> 01:26:12,951
Cause it's witchcraft

936
01:26:14,547 --> 01:26:17,909
- Witchcraft
- I like it here.

937
01:26:18,026 --> 01:26:24,824
And although I know
it's strictly taboo

938
01:26:27,421 --> 01:26:30,652
When you ride with me

939
01:26:32,423 --> 01:26:35,261
Is this the face
of a master criminal?

940
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:39,350
Tonight, we investigate the
mystery behind Grace Trevethyn.

941
01:26:39,467 --> 01:26:42,089
How did an unknown widow
facing bankruptcy...

942
01:26:42,207 --> 01:26:46,614
saved her house and become the most
celebrated novelist of the year.

943
01:26:48,557 --> 01:26:50,875
Mrs. Trevethyn's novel,
"The Joint Venture"...

944
01:26:50,993 --> 01:26:53,963
has topped the best seller
list for over a year now.

945
01:26:54,081 --> 01:26:58,094
Although the book is sold as fiction,
the story bears remarkable similarity...

946
01:26:58,212 --> 01:27:00,212
to Trevethyn's own life.

947
01:27:00,312 --> 01:27:03,691
And her recent marriage to a
mysterious French businessman...

948
01:27:03,791 --> 01:27:07,562
has fueled tabloids' speculation
that she was, at one time...

949
01:27:07,662 --> 01:27:09,707
actually involved
with the drug trade.

950
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,143
So, what is the true story?

951
01:27:12,259 --> 01:27:14,969
We went to the sleepy village
of Port Liac to find out.

952
01:27:15,087 --> 01:27:17,144
Turn it up, Charlie, turn it up.

953
01:27:17,306 --> 01:27:19,406
Wasn't there an incident
up at the Liac House?

954
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:23,537
The police were called, but there
was a problem with witnesses.

955
01:27:23,654 --> 01:27:26,754
- No one wanted to talk?
- No one could remember anything.

956
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:28,757
Excuse me.

957
01:27:29,222 --> 01:27:32,539
- We think it's fiction, don't we?
- Yeah.

958
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:35,192
Because, in the book...

959
01:27:35,658 --> 01:27:40,716
Grace was growing drugs. But,
in real life, she was growing tea!

960
01:27:42,877 --> 01:27:45,240
As a doctor,
a man of science...

961
01:27:48,356 --> 01:27:53,155
I could never condone the use of
a drug for a non-therapeutic thingy.

962
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:58,982
- Have you got anything?
- See me later. It's good.

963
01:27:59,098 --> 01:28:00,460
- Is it?
- Ooh...

964
01:28:00,839 --> 01:28:07,072
It does seem strange that alcohol
is legal and marijuana is not.

965
01:28:07,363 --> 01:28:10,160
It's an accident of History,
I suppose.

966
01:28:15,364 --> 01:28:18,640
So you didn't have any marijuana
growing in your garden?

967
01:28:19,845 --> 01:28:21,685
Bless you.

968
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:26,629
Do you think "The Joint
Venture" is fiction or fact?

969
01:28:26,729 --> 01:28:31,209
No, it's all fiction. My wife has
a fertile imagination, thank God.

970
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:34,775
What about the gangster character
Pedro? Is that based on you?

971
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:37,602
Pedro is Spanish, I'm French.
Don't be absurd.

972
01:28:37,719 --> 01:28:39,759
- No, but we've heard...
- It's time for you to go.

973
01:28:39,894 --> 01:28:42,821
Get off of my land.
I said this is my house!

974
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:48,867
Grace Trevethyn refused
to be interviewed to this program.

975
01:28:49,289 --> 01:28:52,259
And to date she's made no public
statements about the rumors.

976
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,824
Tonight may change that...

977
01:28:53,942 --> 01:28:56,651
as we take you live to
the New York Book Awards...

978
01:28:56,769 --> 01:29:01,176
where Grace Trevethyn has been
short listed for "The Joint Venture".

979
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:05,001
And the winner of the
Award for Fiction goes to...

980
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:11,525
Grace Trevethyn,
for "The Joint Venture"!

981
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:28,878
Gosh, what a surprise!

982
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:36,011
I should be used to surprises after
everything that's happened to me.

983
01:29:36,476 --> 01:29:39,607
I know there's been
a lot of speculation about...

984
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:43,752
whether my book is based
on fact or fiction, but...

985
01:29:43,915 --> 01:29:47,015
well, to tell you the truth...

986
01:29:47,176 --> 01:29:52,798
if I told you what's happened to me,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

987
01:29:52,915 --> 01:29:55,321
I can hardly believe it myself.

988
01:29:56,916 --> 01:30:00,452
I hope they're watching
this at home, because...

989
01:30:01,005 --> 01:30:03,062
I wanted to say...

990
01:30:06,138 --> 01:30:07,890
Matthew...

991
01:30:08,138 --> 01:30:12,413
I wanted to tell you that I think
you are a terrible gardener...

992
01:30:14,531 --> 01:30:17,198
but that you have
helped me to grow.

993
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:23,068
And for that I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

994
01:30:25,577 --> 01:30:29,853
I hope you're having a great party.
Keep the drinks flowing, Charlie.

995
01:30:33,058 --> 01:30:37,856
I've had another idea. I think
there might be a book in it.

996
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,100
Thank You

997
