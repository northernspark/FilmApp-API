00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,914
- Hello?
- Hello.

3
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:24,166
- Yes?
- Who is this?

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,003
- Who're you trying to reach?
- What number is this?

5
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:29,922
- Well, what number are
you trying to reach?
- I don't know.

6
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,341
- Well, I think you have
the wrong number.
- Do l?

7
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,010
It happens. Take it easy.

8
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:46,855
- Hello.
- I'm sorry. I guess I dialled
the wrong number.

9
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:50,400
- So why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.

10
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:54,070
- You're forgiven. Bye now.
- Wait, wait. Don't hang up.

11
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:56,907
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

12
00:00:57,032 --> 00:01:00,160
They've got 900 numbers for that.
See ya.

13
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,183
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

14
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,145
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.

15
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:32,024
- I don't think so.
- What's that noise?

16
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,318
- Popcorn.
- You're making popcorn?

17
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:37,278
- Uh-huh.
- I only eat popcorn at the movies.

18
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:40,740
- Well, I'm getting ready
to watch a video.
- Really? What?

19
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:44,285
- Oh, just some scary movie.
- Do you like scary movies?

20
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:47,247
- Uh-huh.
- What's your favourite scary movie?

21
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:50,166
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favourite.

22
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,252
What comes to mind?

23
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:54,963
Um, "Halloween."

24
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:59,634
You know, the one with the guy
in the white mask who walks around
and stalks baby-sitters.

25
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:01,719
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

26
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:06,348
- Guess.
- Um, "Nightmare on Elm Street".

27
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:10,310
- Is that the one where the guy
had knives for fingers?
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.

28
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:14,147
Freddy, that's right.
I liked that movie. It was scary.

29
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,817
Yeah, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

30
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:19,361
So, you got a boyfriend?

31
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:22,197
Why? You wanna ask me out
on a date?

32
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:25,534
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

33
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,412
- No.
- You never told me your name.

34
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,332
- Why do you want to know my name?
- 'Cause I want to know
who I'm looking at.

35
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,960
What did you say?

36
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:38,296
I want to know
who I'm talking to.

37
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,424
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?

38
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:47,013
What?

39
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,223
Hello?

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,019
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.

41
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:55,354
Uh, nah, I don't think so.

42
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:58,691
Don't hang up on me!

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,242
Shit. Yes?

44
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:12,162
I told you not to hang up on me.

45
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,289
- What do you want?
- To talk.

46
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:17,209
Well, dial someone else, okay?

47
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:29,054
- Listen, asshole--
- No, you listen, you little bitch.

48
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:33,350
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?

49
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:38,020
- Yeah.
- Is this some kind of joke?

50
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:40,731
More of a game, really.

51
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:47,738
Can you handle that, blondie?

52
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,876
Can you see me?

53
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,340
Listen. I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

54
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:11,719
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

55
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:17,433
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

56
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:27,443
Who's there?

57
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,654
Who's there?

58
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,115
I'm calling the police.

59
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:39,621
You should never say "Who's there?"
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

60
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:44,042
You might as well
just come out here to investigate
a strange noise or something.

61
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:49,464
Look, you've had your fun now, so
I think you better just leave or else.

62
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:51,425
Or else what?

63
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:55,971
Or else my boyfriend'll be here
any second and he'll be pissed
when he finds out.

64
00:04:56,138 --> 00:05:00,058
- I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
- I lied! I do have a boyfriend...

65
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,644
and he'll be here any second,
so your ass better be gone.

66
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:05,813
- Sure.
- I swear.

67
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:11,944
He's big and he plays football,
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

68
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,990
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.

69
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:18,201
So you better just leave.

70
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:21,871
His name wouldn't be Steve,
would it?

71
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,125
How do you know his name?

72
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,836
Turn on the patio lights...

73
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:30,922
again.

74
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,725
Oh, God!

75
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:47,145
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Where are you? Where are you?

76
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,356
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.

77
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:52,567
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?

78
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:55,111
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

79
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:57,781
- Then he dies right now.
- No! No! No!

80
00:05:57,948 --> 00:06:00,116
Which is it?

81
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:02,702
Which is it?

82
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:06,247
Well, what kind of a game?

83
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:10,876
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

84
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:13,420
Just do it!

85
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:18,342
No, Casey! No! No!

86
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,427
No, Casey!

87
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,763
Here's how we play.

88
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,350
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

89
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:29,103
- Please don't do this.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

90
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,730
- Please--
- It's an easy category.
- Please.

91
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:36,234
- Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.

92
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:39,737
- Name the killer in "Halloween."
- No.

93
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:42,740
Come on! It's your favourite
scary movie, remember?

94
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:46,077
- He had a white mask.
He stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.

95
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:49,080
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

96
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:51,958
- What's his name?
- I-- I can't think.

97
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,503
Steve's counting on you.

98
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,047
Michael--
Michael Meyers.

99
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:00,675
Yes! Very good.

100
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,760
Now for the real question.

101
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:05,470
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

102
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:08,557
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!

103
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:12,477
Then answer the question.
Same category.

104
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:15,105
Oh, please stop.

105
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:18,233
Name the killer in
"Friday the 13th."

106
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,777
Jason! Jason, Jason!

107
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:24,406
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.

108
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:27,284
No, it's not!
No, it's not. It was Jason.

109
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:29,703
Afraid not. No way.

110
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,582
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddam times!

111
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:36,792
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs Voorhees, was the original killer.

112
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,170
Jason didn't show up
until the sequel.

113
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:42,256
I'm afraid that was
a wrong answer.

114
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:46,219
- You tricked me.
- Lucky for you there's a bonus round.

115
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:50,056
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!

116
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,416
Hey, we're not finished yet.

117
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:24,506
Final question.
Are you ready?

118
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:27,342
Please, please, leave me alone.

119
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,386
Answer the question,
and I will.

120
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:34,307
What door am I at?

121
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:37,768
-What?
-There are two main doors to your house.

122
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,854
The front door
and the patio doors.

123
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,191
If you answer correctly,
you live. Very simple.

124
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,570
Don't do this.
I can't. I won't.

125
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,864
Your call.

126
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,504
Did you water
over here today?

127
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:12,424
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?

128
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,427
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.

129
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:21,057
Mom!

130
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,393
- Jesus!
- What is it?

131
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,741
Casey!

132
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,497
Oh, G--

133
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,461
Casey. Casey. Casey!

134
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:55,800
- Where is she?
- Call the police!

135
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,975
- Casey! Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

136
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:05,352
- Where is she?
- She's-- She's here.

137
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,479
- Mom.
- Oh, my God, l, I can hear her.

138
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:10,941
- Mom.
- Where is she?

139
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,028
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.

140
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:17,114
Hey!

141
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,288
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

142
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:27,040
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

143
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:29,250
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

144
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:13,795
- It's just me.
- Billy, what the--
What are you doing here?

145
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:16,882
- Sorry, don't hate me.
- Oh, my God!
- What, do you sleep in that?

146
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:20,051
Yes, I sleep in this. You gotta go.
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.

147
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:24,389
- Okay, I'll just stay a sec.
- No-- You can't be in here.
Oh, no. You gotta go. Go, go, go.

148
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:28,601
-What's going on in there? Are you okay?
-Can you knock?

149
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:33,564
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.
- No?

150
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,066
Oh, well.
I'm hittin' the sack.

151
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,611
My flight leaves
first thing in the morning.

152
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,031
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back till Sunday.

153
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,575
- There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at--
- The Hilton.

154
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:47,411
- Out at the airport, so call if--
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.

155
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,497
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.

156
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,294
- Have a good trip, okay?
- Sleep tight, sweetie.

157
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,719
- Oh, close call.
- Billy, what're you doing here?

158
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,973
- Well, it occurred to me that I've
never snuck through your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.

159
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,434
Great idea. Now that
it's out of your system.

160
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,604
You know, I was home
watching television. The, uh--

161
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:19,359
"The Exorcist" was on.
It got me thinking of you.

162
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,654
- It did?
- Yeah, it was edited for TV.

163
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:27,324
You know, all the good stuff was cut
out. And it got me thinking of us...

164
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,830
how two years ago
we started off hot and heavy.

165
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:36,124
Nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.

166
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,088
And now
things have changed and...

167
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,430
Iately we're just sort of
edited for television.

168
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:56,561
Oh, so you thought you would
climb in my window and we'd have
a little raw footage?

169
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:01,983
No. No, I wouldn't dream
of breaking your underwear rule.

170
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,529
I just thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

171
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:14,162
- Okay.
- Yeah?

172
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:19,458
- Yeah.
- If we ever fly away

173
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,921
Baby, I'm with you

174
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:28,842
Baby, I'm your man

175
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,927
Hey.

176
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:50,363
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-bucket.

177
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,034
God, you see what
you do to me?

178
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:57,077
You know what
my dad'll do to you?

179
00:15:57,244 --> 00:16:00,539
Yeah. I'm going.

180
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:02,625
Okay.

181
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:07,546
Romeo and Juliet

182
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:10,466
Are together in eternity

183
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:13,135
You know, l-- I appreciate
the romantic gesture.

184
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:15,805
So, come on, baby

185
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:19,558
Hey, about the, uh--
the sex stuff...

186
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:22,269
I-l'm not trying
to rush you at all.

187
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:26,773
- I was only half serious.
- Okay.

188
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,068
Baby, I'm your man

189
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:35,698
Baby, I'm your man

190
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:37,867
Hey, Billy.

191
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:41,746
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

192
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:43,832
What's that?

193
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:53,341
My God.
You're just a tease.

194
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:03,433
Thirty-five--

195
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,186
Situation under control.

196
00:17:06,353 --> 00:17:09,648
Roger, dispatch.

197
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:13,152
There's blood found?
All right.

198
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:30,293
They are doing drugs that
they buy in the classrooms...

199
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,462
and that they are
involved in the occult.

200
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,547
Occult?

201
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:41,220
Woodsboro, California, was devastated
last night when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

202
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:44,682
Authorities have yet to issue
a statement, but our sources tell us...

203
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:47,310
that no arrest has been made
and the murderer could strike again.

204
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:50,396
- Do you believe this shit?
- Damn! What is going on?

205
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:52,523
- You don't know?
- No.

206
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,985
- Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.
- What? No way.

207
00:17:57,152 --> 00:18:00,155
And we're not just talking killed.
We're talking splatter-movie killed.

208
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:02,240
Ripped open
from end to end.

209
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:06,870
- Casey Becker, she sits
next to me in English.
- Not any more. It's so sad.

210
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:10,582
Her mom and dad, they found her hanging
from a tree, her insides on the outside.

211
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:14,211
Oh, my God!
Do they know who did it?

212
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:17,547
Fucking clueless. I mean, they're
interrogating the entire school.

213
00:18:17,714 --> 00:18:20,133
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?

214
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,887
They don't know. I mean,
Dewey was saying this is the
worst crime they've seen in years.

215
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:26,180
Even worse than--

216
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:28,891
Well, it's bad.

217
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:38,192
- Here you go, Mrs Tate.
- Thank you, James.

218
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:44,949
Sidney. It would appear
to be your turn.

219
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,289
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.
- Prescott.

220
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:55,126
She was daughter of, uh--

221
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:59,045
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

222
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:03,007
- Hi, Sidney.
- Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

223
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:07,428
Uh, that's Deputy Riley
today, Sid.

224
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:10,265
- How is everything?
- Good.

225
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,392
And your dad?
How's he doin'?

226
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,813
- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this
very brief, Sidney.

227
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,608
- The police just want to ask you
a few questions. You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:23,862
Sidney, were you very
close to Casey Becker?

229
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:27,531
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

230
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:32,119
All students are encouraged
to return to their homes promptly
from school grounds. Avoid strangers.

231
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:34,955
- Walk in twos and threes.
Counsellors will be here tomorrow.
- What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?

232
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:37,624
- Thank you.
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- Yeah, they asked me that too.

233
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,127
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.

234
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:44,214
- Did they ask you?
- Hunt? Why would they ask you
if you like to hunt?

235
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,967
'Cause their bodies
were gutted.

236
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:50,012
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

237
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,140
- It's 'cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.

238
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:55,851
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic lnstinct."

239
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:58,269
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

240
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:00,855
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

241
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,858
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

242
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:08,029
- Or a man's mentality.
- How do you gut someone?

243
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:16,829
You take a knife, and you slit 'em
from the groin to sternum.

244
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:20,166
Hey, it's called tact,
you fuck rag.

245
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,169
Hey, Stu, didn't you
used to date Casey?

246
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:26,880
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she dumped you for Steve.

247
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:29,341
- I thought you dumped her for me.
- I did. He's full of shit.

248
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:31,968
And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

249
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:34,679
Hey, what're you saying?
That-- That-- That I killed her?

250
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:39,351
- It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."
- Stu was with me last night, okay?

251
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:44,272
- Yeah, I was.
- Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

252
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:47,818
- Fuck you, nut case.
Where were you last night?
- Working, thank you.

253
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:53,323
- Oh, at the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.
- Twice.

254
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,076
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.

255
00:20:57,243 --> 00:21:03,165
Thanks, buddy. Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

256
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:08,671
- I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.
- Tell me something. Did you really
put her liver in the mailbox?

257
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:12,800
'Cause I heard that they
found her liver in the mailbox
next to her spleen and her pancreas.

258
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,469
Randy, you goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here. Okay?

259
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:19,098
She's getting mad, all right?
You better "liver" alone.

260
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:24,895
"Liver" alone!

261
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,151
"Liv--" Ow! "Liver. Liver. Liv--"
It was a joke.

262
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:39,909
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

263
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:07,060
So, you sure I can stay over, 'cause
my dad won't be back till Sunday.

264
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:10,814
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practise.

265
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,900
You okay?

266
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:16,403
Uh-huh. It's just, you know,
the police and reporters...

267
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,156
and everything,
it's like deja vu all over again.

268
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:21,658
I'll be there by 7:00,
I promise.

269
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:23,744
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

270
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:15,669
The bodies of 17-year-old Casey Becker
and her 18-year-old boyfriend
Steven Orth...

271
00:23:15,836 --> 00:23:17,754
were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents--

272
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:23,343
The Woodsboro double murder case.
Authorities are baffled by the lack
of clues and the savage--

273
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,470
The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...

274
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:29,306
although this is not the first
time this small community...

275
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:31,767
of Woodsboro has endured
such tragedy.

276
00:23:31,934 --> 00:23:34,395
Only a year ago Maureen Prescott,
wife and mother...

277
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:38,941
was found raped and murdered not far
from this peaceful town square.

278
00:24:49,843 --> 00:24:53,347
- Hello?
- Practise ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?

279
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:59,685
- It's past 7:00.
- Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't
bite it till way after 10:00.

280
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:03,105
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.

281
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:07,026
I'm gonna swing by the video store.
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in
"All The Right Moves."

282
00:25:07,193 --> 00:25:09,862
You know, if you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

283
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:13,032
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.

284
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,046
- Tatum, just get in the car--
- Hello, Sidney.

285
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:31,883
Uh, hi, who is this?

286
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,969
You tell me.

287
00:25:36,388 --> 00:25:40,142
- Well, l-l have no idea.
- Scary night, isn't it?

288
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:45,939
With the murders and all,
it's like right out of
a horror movie or something.

289
00:25:46,106 --> 00:25:50,152
Randy, you gave yourself away.
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

290
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:53,447
Do you like scary movies,
Sidney?

291
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:56,782
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

292
00:25:56,949 --> 00:25:59,535
What's your favourite
scary movie?

293
00:25:59,702 --> 00:26:03,456
- Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.
- Why not? Too scared?

294
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:06,333
No, no. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

295
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,378
Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...

296
00:26:09,545 --> 00:26:11,881
who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.

297
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:16,469
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?

298
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:19,346
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

299
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:22,558
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.

300
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:33,777
- So, who are you?
- The question isn't "Who am l?"

301
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:37,197
The question is
"Where am l?"

302
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:41,284
S-S-So, where are you?

303
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:43,787
Your front porch.

304
00:26:47,832 --> 00:26:50,251
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

305
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:52,879
That's the original part.

306
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,549
Oh, yeah?

307
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:03,138
Well, I call your bluff.

308
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,653
- So, where are you?
- Right here.

309
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:54,522
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. Okay.

310
00:27:54,689 --> 00:27:57,524
What am I doin'? Huh?

311
00:27:57,691 --> 00:28:00,861
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

312
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:06,324
Nice try, Randy. Tell Tatum
to hurry up, okay? Bye now.

313
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:09,161
If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!

314
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:15,959
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.

315
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,464
Fuck you, you cretin!

316
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:51,285
No!

317
00:29:20,188 --> 00:29:22,190
Shit!

318
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,166
- Billy!
- The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

319
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,044
The killer's here. He's in the house.
No, he's in the house.

320
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:46,130
He's got a knife.
He's gonna kill us.

321
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:50,801
He's gone. He's gone.
It's all right.

322
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:03,980
What?

323
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:08,651
Sid, what?

324
00:30:10,278 --> 00:30:14,282
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

325
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:17,118
What's going on?
Sidney, come back!

326
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:19,370
Sidney!

327
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:27,794
Sorry! I found this.
Come on!

328
00:30:27,961 --> 00:30:31,381
- All right, hold your hands together.
- Do you wish to give up your right
to remain silent?

329
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:34,718
- I didn't do anything.
- Do you wish to give up your
right to speak to an attorney...

330
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:36,803
and have them present
during questioning?

331
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,556
Ask her. She'll tell you.
Ask her.

332
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,934
- What do you got, Dewey?
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait, who is that?

333
00:30:43,101 --> 00:30:46,146
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.

334
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:48,899
- I didn't do it.
- Let's go.

335
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:51,735
Sheriff, wait!
Wait, listen. Call my dad.

336
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,446
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.

337
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:57,573
Sidney! Sidney!

338
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,534
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

339
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:04,663
- She'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.
- Sid!

340
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,666
Well, we're seein'
a lot of you today.

341
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,795
You gonna be able to come down to the
station and answer a few questions, Sid?

342
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:14,256
Oh, shit, Sidney! God, Sid, I'm so sorry
I was late. Are you all right?

343
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:17,676
- Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.
- It's okay.

344
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:20,763
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

345
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,307
- Does Mom know?
- Yes, doofus.

346
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:26,268
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

347
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:29,813
- Come on, Sid.
- Oh, you won't believe this.

348
00:31:32,774 --> 00:31:35,443
Creepy, huh?

349
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,121
- I'll be damned.
- What?
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!

350
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:48,623
My name isn't Jesus.

351
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:53,795
Sidney, is that you in there? Excuse me.
Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?

352
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:55,880
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

353
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,883
- None of your damn business.
- I heard something about
a costume. Is that true?

354
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:03,720
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.

355
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:06,098
Leave Sid alone.

356
00:32:06,265 --> 00:32:09,059
Where's she goin'?

357
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,895
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

358
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,983
I know that you're about 50 pounds
overweight, but when I say "hurry"...

359
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:21,238
please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"

360
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,870
- Did you find him?
- Are you sure it was the Hilton?

361
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:33,624
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.

362
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:38,171
Could he have stayed
somewhere else?

363
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:41,215
I don't know. I guess.

364
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:47,013
- Don't worry, Sid. We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.

365
00:32:48,306 --> 00:32:51,184
- Roger, dispatch.
- I'll be right back.

366
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:58,064
Hold on a minute.

367
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:03,153
Let me ask you this. What're you
doin' with a cellular telephone, son?

368
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,989
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

369
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:09,910
- I didn't make those calls, I swear.
- Why don't you check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake!

370
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:15,957
- Call Vital Phone Comp. They got
the records of every number dialled.
- Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.

371
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:20,921
- What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?
- I wanted to see her, that's all.

372
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:24,758
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

373
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:27,927
You went out last night?

374
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:31,388
I was watchin' TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

375
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:33,641
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

376
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:38,771
No. No, I didn't.
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody!

377
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:47,196
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
till we get those phone records.

378
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:53,327
This is crazy.

379
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:56,747
You know that?
I didn't do it.

380
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,676
- Camera Two?
- Go. I do.
- Okay.

381
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:12,178
Are there any more
doughnuts in there?

382
00:34:12,345 --> 00:34:14,514
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

383
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:17,642
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.

384
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:22,021
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.
- Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live
from Woodsboro police station...

385
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:24,607
- Hey, where's she going?
- where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

386
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:28,277
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you
know who you're dealing with?
- No cameras, please.

387
00:34:28,444 --> 00:34:31,280
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

388
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:33,574
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

389
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,951
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- All right, come on.

390
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,829
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.

391
00:34:38,996 --> 00:34:41,039
Come on!

392
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:49,256
Sid, we're gonna get you out of here,
okay? Are you okay?

393
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,928
They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

394
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:58,306
There's no way
to track the purchase.

395
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:02,226
- What about that cellular phone bill?
- Well, we're pulling Loomis's account.

396
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,479
We won't know anything
until the morning.

397
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:07,356
Oh, come on!

398
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:11,444
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance."

399
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:16,032
But these kids today,
damned if I know.

400
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,327
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

401
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:21,704
Goddamn it, Dewey!

402
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:25,458
What did Mama tell you?
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law!

403
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:30,754
- I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go. Now, okay?
- Whoa.

404
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:35,467
Uh, take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

405
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,928
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

406
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:41,348
- He's my superior.
- The janitor is your superior.

407
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,727
Let's get back to work!

408
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,738
- Isn't there a back way
out of this building?
- Yeah. Down that alley, I think.

409
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:04,537
You guys just stay here. I'm gonna get
the car. Don't move. Don't make a sound.

410
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,500
There she is. Sidney!

411
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,461
Hi. That was some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

412
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,965
- She's not answering any questions,
all right? Just leave us alone.
- No. No. Tatum. It's okay.

413
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,760
- She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?
- Yes, that's right.

414
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,013
- So, how's the book?
- Well, it'll be out later this year.

415
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,391
Oh, I'll look for it.

416
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,018
I'll send you a copy.

417
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:33,273
- Jeez. Nice shot.
- Bitch!

418
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,401
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

419
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:39,320
God, I loved it.
"l'll send you a copy."

420
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:41,739
Bam! Bitch went down.

421
00:36:41,906 --> 00:36:47,412
"l'll send you a copy." Bam!
Sid-- Superbitch! You are so cool.

422
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,039
Thought you might want
some ice for that right hook.

423
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:52,292
Thanks.

424
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:55,628
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

425
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:58,046
Yeah, yeah.

426
00:37:03,093 --> 00:37:06,054
Do you really think
Billy did it?

427
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:09,141
He was there, Tatum.

428
00:37:09,308 --> 00:37:14,897
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

429
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:18,025
- Telephone, honey.
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.

430
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:20,861
- My dad?
- I don't think so.

431
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:23,739
- Take a message.
- No, um, I'll get it.

432
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:30,078
How's she doin'?

433
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:37,126
- Hello.
- Hello, Sidney.

434
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:40,713
- No!
- Poor Billy-boyfriend.

435
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,675
- An innocent guy doesn't stand
a chance with you.
- Leave me alone!

436
00:37:44,842 --> 00:37:48,679
- Looks like you fingered
the wrong guy again.
- Dewey!

437
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:51,599
- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.
- Don't worry.

438
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:55,603
-You'll find out soon enough. I promise.
-Dewey!

439
00:37:58,313 --> 00:38:00,273
What?

440
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:05,278
- What?
- What?

441
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,244
Hello.

442
00:38:21,878 --> 00:38:25,715
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...

443
00:38:25,882 --> 00:38:29,510
is the daughter of Maureen Prescott
who was brutally killed last year...

444
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:32,430
when convicted murderer Cotton Weary
broke into their home...

445
00:38:32,596 --> 00:38:35,433
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

446
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,269
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting
appeal for the death sentence...

447
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:41,647
handed down after the young Sidney
testified against him.

448
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:45,401
She was the key witness in
the State's case against the--

449
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:50,531
It's never gonna stop,
is it?

450
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:53,159
Billy was released.

451
00:38:53,325 --> 00:38:56,662
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

452
00:38:56,829 --> 00:38:59,581
We're checkin' every cellular account
in the county.

453
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:03,752
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

454
00:39:03,918 --> 00:39:08,131
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

455
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:10,967
You okay?

456
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:28,901
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.

457
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,404
- So how does it feel to be almost
brutally butchered?
- Hey! Hey, now leave her alone.
- Come on, Sid.

458
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:35,032
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.
- Leave her alone.

459
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,746
- How does it feel?
- She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

460
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:42,831
What?

461
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:46,919
Just a sec.

462
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,931
- Stop right there.
- I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

463
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:03,017
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.

464
00:40:03,184 --> 00:40:05,770
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.

465
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:08,314
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!

466
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,571
Your mother's murder was last year's
hottest court case. Somebody was gonna
write a book about it.

467
00:40:15,738 --> 00:40:19,867
- Right. And it had to be you with
all your lies and bullshit theories.
- What is your problem?

468
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:25,373
You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary's
in jail. They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.

469
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:31,711
- Do you still think he's innocent?
- Your testimony put him away.

470
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:33,964
It doesn't really matter
what I think.

471
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,551
During the trial, you did all those
stories about me. You called me a liar.

472
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:40,846
I think you falsely
identified him, yes.

473
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:44,015
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

474
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:47,310
- And has his story changed?
- Not one word.

475
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:50,063
He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.

476
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,607
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

477
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:57,820
He raped her, and then he-- he butchered
her. Her blood was all over his coat.

478
00:40:57,987 --> 00:41:02,616
He was drunk that night.
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

479
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:07,580
- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat.

480
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:13,461
The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

481
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:17,798
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

482
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:23,179
You're not so sure
any more, are you?

483
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:26,891
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.

484
00:41:27,057 --> 00:41:29,976
- The killer's still
on the loose, isn't he?
- Come on, Sid.

485
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:33,897
- Those murders are related.
- I'm sorry I mangled your face.

486
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:37,400
- Wait, Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?

487
00:41:43,448 --> 00:41:46,993
Jesus Christ!
An innocent man on death row.

488
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,829
- A killer still on the loose.
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?

489
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:52,665
No, no, no. Not so fast.
We don't have anything concrete.

490
00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:57,462
-This is huge. You can't just sit on it.
-I know! That's why we need proof.

491
00:41:57,629 --> 00:42:01,590
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

492
00:42:01,757 --> 00:42:05,010
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

493
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:08,597
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

494
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:12,226
I want you to meet me right
here after class, okay, Sid?

495
00:42:12,392 --> 00:42:14,812
All right.

496
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:19,024
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

497
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:21,360
Oh, you mean after you
branded him the Candyman?

498
00:42:21,527 --> 00:42:24,738
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!

499
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,081
Why are they doing this?

500
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:38,334
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

501
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:40,878
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

502
00:42:41,045 --> 00:42:43,631
Sidney!

503
00:42:43,798 --> 00:42:46,259
- Ow!
- Jesus! Shit!

504
00:42:46,426 --> 00:42:49,220
It's just me.

505
00:42:49,387 --> 00:42:52,223
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

506
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,684
No. No, l-l don't.

507
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:58,478
- It's just somebody was there.
- Hey, Christy, wait up!

508
00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:01,022
- Billy, someone--
someone tried to kill me.
- I know. I know. I know.

509
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:05,402
The cops said I scared him away.
It wasn't me, Sid.

510
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:08,822
I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.

511
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:13,702
You see? It couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?

512
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:19,291
I'm so sorry.
Please understand.

513
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:23,170
Understand what? That I have a
girlfriend who would rather accuse me...

514
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:25,922
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

515
00:43:28,132 --> 00:43:30,259
- You know that's not true.
- Then what is it?

516
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:34,847
What is it? Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!

517
00:43:35,014 --> 00:43:36,974
I mean between us.

518
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:39,643
You haven't been
the same since--

519
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:43,689
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?

520
00:43:43,856 --> 00:43:46,567
My mom was killed. I can't believe
you're bringing this up!

521
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:50,404
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.

522
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:54,992
I know. I think it's time
you got over that. I mean,
when my mom left my dad, I accepted it.

523
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:58,203
It's the way it is.
She's not comin' back.

524
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,372
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

525
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,875
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

526
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:08,713
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's-- It's a bad analogy.

527
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,840
But it's just that...

528
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:12,926
I want my girlfriend back.

529
00:44:16,137 --> 00:44:18,932
- Sid!
- Billy, I am sorry
if my traumatized life...

530
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:22,185
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

531
00:44:22,352 --> 00:44:25,397
What? What are you--
Nobody said that. Sid!

532
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:31,402
- Stupid.
- You make me so sick!

533
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:36,740
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!

534
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:42,246
So, two of your fellow students
just savagely murdered...

535
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,582
and this is the way that you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

536
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:49,336
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!

537
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:52,339
Oh, come on, Mr Himbry!
It was just a joke.

538
00:44:52,506 --> 00:44:54,675
Yeah, that's not fair!

539
00:44:58,261 --> 00:45:00,513
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.

540
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,891
Fairness would be to rip your
insides out, hang you from a tree...

541
00:45:04,058 --> 00:45:08,187
so we can expose you for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

542
00:45:20,742 --> 00:45:24,328
- She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.
- Why would she lie about it?

543
00:45:24,495 --> 00:45:27,874
For attention!
The girl has some serious issues.

544
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:38,300
What if she did it? What if
Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

545
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:40,385
And why would she do that?

546
00:45:40,552 --> 00:45:43,847
Maybe she had the hots for Steve and
killed them both in a jealous rage.

547
00:45:44,014 --> 00:45:49,394
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt
boyfriend, Billy.

548
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:52,314
Maybe she's a slut
just like her mother.

549
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:55,859
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.

550
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:59,612
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.

551
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:01,989
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

552
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:04,658
Her mother's death
leaves her disturbed and hostile.

553
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:08,287
In a cruel and inhumane world,
she's delusional.

554
00:46:08,454 --> 00:46:11,332
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.

555
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:14,168
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...

556
00:46:14,335 --> 00:46:17,588
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...

557
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:21,675
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

558
00:46:21,842 --> 00:46:25,304
- Where do you get this shit?
- "Ricki Lake."

559
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:27,890
You are pathetic.

560
00:46:41,152 --> 00:46:43,279
Pathetic.

561
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:45,532
Sidney.

562
00:47:10,723 --> 00:47:13,559
Sidney.

563
00:47:18,147 --> 00:47:20,983
Is someone there?

564
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:03,482
In what appears to be a prank, several
students were seen wearing scary masks.

565
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:05,817
School officials
have yet to comment...

566
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:09,613
but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.

567
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,659
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth
have already lost their lives.

568
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:19,581
Who's next? You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

569
00:48:19,748 --> 00:48:23,001
Hi. Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, "Top Story."

570
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:26,296
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.
How's the eye?

571
00:48:26,463 --> 00:48:29,048
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

572
00:48:29,215 --> 00:48:31,217
No, everything's under control.

573
00:48:31,383 --> 00:48:34,762
- Well, of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.

574
00:48:34,929 --> 00:48:40,184
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker,
but who knew?

575
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:45,106
- You look awfully young
to be a police officer.
- I'm 25 years old.

576
00:48:45,272 --> 00:48:50,778
You know, in a demographic study
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

577
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:55,074
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.

578
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:59,452
Except in that upper torso area.
Does the force require you to work out?

579
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:03,206
No, ma'am.
Because of my boyish good looks...

580
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:07,502
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

581
00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:11,589
I need your attention now, kids. Due to
the recent events that have occurred...

582
00:49:11,756 --> 00:49:16,886
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

583
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:20,432
The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...

584
00:49:20,598 --> 00:49:23,852
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

585
00:49:24,018 --> 00:49:26,187
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

586
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:28,647
Well, serial killer's
not really accurate.

587
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:31,108
Gotta knock off a couple more
to get that title.

588
00:49:31,275 --> 00:49:34,236
Well, we can hope,
can't we?

589
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:36,655
I mean, we certainly
don't have any leads.

590
00:49:36,822 --> 00:49:40,576
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.

591
00:49:40,743 --> 00:49:45,956
- Well, he's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out
as a possibility.

592
00:49:46,123 --> 00:49:49,543
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

593
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,714
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...

594
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:56,967
you are much prettier in person.

595
00:49:57,134 --> 00:49:59,218
So you do watch the show.

596
00:50:01,179 --> 00:50:05,975
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.

597
00:50:06,142 --> 00:50:09,353
Please, call me Gale!

598
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,773
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

599
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:13,941
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.

600
00:50:14,108 --> 00:50:18,321
Well, you're not to be alone any more.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

601
00:50:18,488 --> 00:50:20,740
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out."

602
00:50:20,907 --> 00:50:25,161
I don't know what you did, Sidney,
but on behalf of the entire student
body, we all say, "Thank you!"

603
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:27,830
- Drop it, Stu.
- No, I say...

604
00:50:27,997 --> 00:50:30,373
an impromptu party tonight,
my house.

605
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,544
- Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?
- Are you serious?

606
00:50:34,711 --> 00:50:38,965
As long as this little vixen doesn't
invite the entire world, we'll be fine.

607
00:50:39,132 --> 00:50:41,259
Intimate gathering,
intimate friends.

608
00:50:41,426 --> 00:50:45,097
What do you say, Sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks?

609
00:50:45,263 --> 00:50:48,725
I will totally protect you. Yo,
I am so buff. I got you covered, girl.

610
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:52,729
- No.
- Come on, Sid. For me?

611
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:55,273
It could be fun.

612
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,110
- Okay. Whatever.
- Yeah? Nice.

613
00:50:59,276 --> 00:51:02,029
Cool. You guys
bring food, all right?

614
00:51:19,046 --> 00:51:21,173
Yes?

615
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,259
Hello?

616
00:51:58,084 --> 00:52:01,628
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?

617
00:52:01,795 --> 00:52:04,548
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.

618
00:53:05,444 --> 00:53:09,532
School's out for summer

619
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:14,704
- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary
is telling the truth?

620
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:18,332
- With fever
- Maybe he was having
an affair with your mom.

621
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:22,044
- I mean, your dad was always
out of town on business. Maybe--
- School's out

622
00:53:22,211 --> 00:53:25,464
- Completely
- Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.

623
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,634
If-- If they were having
an affair, then how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

624
00:53:30,886 --> 00:53:34,556
Well, you can't prove a rumour.
That's why it's a rumour.

625
00:53:34,723 --> 00:53:38,685
Right. Created by that little
tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

626
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:45,650
It goes further back, Sid.
There's been talk about other men.

627
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:48,195
And you believe it.

628
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:53,742
Well, I mean,
you can only hear that Richard Gere
gerbil story so many times...

629
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:57,077
before you have to start
believing it.

630
00:54:01,499 --> 00:54:03,459
Oh, I'm sorry.

631
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:10,966
You know, if-if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary, then
the killer's still out there.

632
00:54:11,133 --> 00:54:15,387
Don't go there, Sid.
You're starting to sound like
some Wes Carpenter flick or something.

633
00:54:15,554 --> 00:54:19,725
Don't freak yourself out, okay? We've
got a long night ahead of us. Okay?

634
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,479
Let's boogie.

635
00:54:27,023 --> 00:54:29,567
- It's alive!
- Henry!

636
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:32,654
Oh, in the name of God,
now I know--

637
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:34,739
Excuse me, dude.

638
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:38,701
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

639
00:54:42,872 --> 00:54:45,083
Dork.

640
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,961
Jesus, this place
is packed tonight, man.

641
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:51,381
- We had a run
in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?

642
00:54:51,548 --> 00:54:54,384
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know.
- Cool.

643
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,927
What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?

644
00:54:57,094 --> 00:55:00,097
- "The Howling." Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

645
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:06,019
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

646
00:55:06,186 --> 00:55:09,273
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...

647
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,817
would you be standing
in the horror section?

648
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:16,295
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.

649
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:20,549
You're such a little lapdog. He's got
"killer" printed all over his forehead.

650
00:55:20,716 --> 00:55:25,595
Okay! Really? Well, why'd the cops
let him go, smart guy?

651
00:55:25,762 --> 00:55:29,766
Because obviously
they don't watch enough movies.
This is standard horror movie stuff.

652
00:55:29,933 --> 00:55:34,478
- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna
kill his own girlfriend?

653
00:55:34,645 --> 00:55:37,606
There's always some stupid,
bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.

654
00:55:37,773 --> 00:55:41,235
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all:
simplicity.

655
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:44,988
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.

656
00:55:45,155 --> 00:55:47,615
Well, what's his reason?

657
00:55:47,782 --> 00:55:50,827
Maybe Sidney
wouldn't have sex with him.

658
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:53,204
- What, is she savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.

659
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:57,958
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

660
00:56:03,547 --> 00:56:05,841
No, I don't at all. No.

661
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:09,344
You know who I think it is?

662
00:56:09,511 --> 00:56:11,972
You know, I think
it's her father.

663
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,474
Why can't they find
her pops, man?

664
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,477
Because he's probably dead.

665
00:56:17,643 --> 00:56:20,312
His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!

666
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:24,108
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

667
00:56:24,275 --> 00:56:26,610
- See, the police are always
off track with this shit.
- Man!

668
00:56:26,777 --> 00:56:28,862
If they'd watch "Prom Night,"
they'd save time.

669
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:33,575
There's a formula to it. A very simple
formula! Everybody's a suspect!

670
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:43,835
I'm telling you, the dad's
a red herring. It's Billy.

671
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:48,422
How do we know you're
not the killer? Huh? Huh?

672
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:52,885
- Hi, Billy.
- Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its
reality button. You ever think of that?

673
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:55,179
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

674
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:58,890
- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.

675
00:56:59,057 --> 00:57:01,601
And what would be
your motive?

676
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:05,605
It's the millennium.
Motives are incidental.

677
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:07,815
"Millennium."

678
00:57:07,982 --> 00:57:12,069
"Millennium." I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.

679
00:57:13,236 --> 00:57:16,532
Good kid.

680
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,367
"Millennium."
Good word, my man.

681
00:57:19,493 --> 00:57:21,411
Are you telling me
that's not a killer?

682
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:26,916
You'll see him
in your nightmares

683
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,752
You'll see him
in your dreams

684
00:57:32,421 --> 00:57:35,591
He'll appear
out of nowhere

685
00:57:35,758 --> 00:57:37,843
But he ain't

686
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,012
What he seems

687
00:57:41,179 --> 00:57:43,223
You'll see him in your head

688
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:45,474
On the TV screen

689
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:49,145
Hey, buddy
I'm warnin' you to turn it off

690
00:57:49,312 --> 00:57:51,564
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god

691
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:55,067
He's a man
He's a guru

692
00:57:56,611 --> 00:58:01,073
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan

693
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,244
Designed and directed
by his red right hand

694
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:09,581
Sure is quiet.

695
00:58:09,748 --> 00:58:12,792
God, look at this place.
It's "The Town That Dreaded Sundown."

696
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:17,045
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

697
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:20,674
Hey, Sid, just think. If they make a
movie about you, who's gonna play you?

698
00:58:20,841 --> 00:58:24,678
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

699
00:58:24,845 --> 00:58:28,306
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

700
00:58:28,474 --> 00:58:31,184
I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.

701
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:34,270
You girls don't go too far.

702
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:38,357
- Is Billy gonna be there tonight?
- He better not be.

703
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:43,404
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

704
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:48,742
Billy's right, you know. Whenever
he touches me, I just can't relax.

705
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:52,579
So you have a few intimacy issues as a
result of your mother's untimely death.

706
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:54,998
It's no big deal, Sid.
I mean, you'll thaw out.

707
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:58,376
Yeah, but he has been so patient with
me, you know, with all the sex stuff.

708
00:58:58,542 --> 00:59:02,380
How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

709
00:59:02,547 --> 00:59:05,758
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

710
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:18,644
- Dewey, where the hell you been?
- I was keepin' an eye on Sidney, uh--

711
00:59:20,271 --> 00:59:24,692
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it--

712
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:28,779
Dewey, Vital Phone
just faxed us.

713
00:59:28,946 --> 00:59:32,992
Those calls are listed
to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.

714
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:37,412
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

715
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:40,415
There's no way a cellular
could've been cloned?

716
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:43,460
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.

717
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:46,421
The anniversary
of his wife's death.

718
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:51,550
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew
in effect through the night.

719
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:55,054
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

720
00:59:56,555 --> 01:00:00,141
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?

721
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:03,269
No. Not just yet.

722
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:07,315
Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

723
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,368
You stay close to Sidney.
Don't let her out of your sight.

724
01:00:19,535 --> 01:00:22,203
Yes, sir.

725
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:45,058
Say a prayer
for the youth of America

726
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:51,606
God bless the youth
of America

727
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,945
And I can't stand
their sight any more

728
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,280
All right,
you girls have fun.

729
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,116
Not too much fun,
or I'll bust ya.

730
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:06,328
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

731
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:13,668
You're obsessed

732
01:01:13,835 --> 01:01:18,465
You're obsessed

733
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:20,550
Here, kids!

734
01:01:23,135 --> 01:01:26,972
- Oh, that's mature.
- You guys were tardy for the party,
so we started without you.

735
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:29,433
My man!

736
01:01:48,367 --> 01:01:52,246
- Well, were we spotted?
- I don't think so. Go get the camera.

737
01:01:54,873 --> 01:01:56,791
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare ya.

738
01:01:56,958 --> 01:02:01,004
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?

739
01:02:01,171 --> 01:02:05,341
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

740
01:02:05,508 --> 01:02:09,761
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

741
01:02:09,928 --> 01:02:12,598
Then what are you
doing here?

742
01:02:14,224 --> 01:02:16,560
Just keepin' an eye
on things.

743
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:19,562
I'm gonna check the party out.

744
01:02:19,729 --> 01:02:24,109
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

745
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:27,445
All right.
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.

746
01:02:33,075 --> 01:02:36,286
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

747
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:38,372
Oh! Yeah.

748
01:02:39,873 --> 01:02:42,709
- How many "Evil Deads?"
- One!
- Two!

749
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,462
- How many "Hellraisers?"
- Hellraiser right here.

750
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:48,589
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night."

751
01:02:48,756 --> 01:02:52,092
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

752
01:02:52,259 --> 01:02:54,679
She's the scream queen.

753
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:57,932
- With a set of lungs like that,
she should be.
- Yeah.

754
01:02:58,098 --> 01:03:01,601
- Tits. See?
- Oh, I'll get it.

755
01:03:04,187 --> 01:03:07,566
- Hey, Tate, grab me
another beer, would ya?
- There's more beer in the garage.

756
01:03:07,732 --> 01:03:11,444
- What am l, the beer wench?
- She was nominated--

757
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:14,446
- She was nominated for "Terror Train."
- You're not gonna believe who's here!

758
01:03:14,613 --> 01:03:17,825
- It's that chick from "Top Story!"
- Gale Weathers?
- Here!

759
01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:20,911
- Shit!
- You're under age, son.

760
01:03:22,579 --> 01:03:25,541
I'm kiddin'. Have a good time.
Watch the drivin'.

761
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:27,751
- Dewey.
- Hi.

762
01:03:27,918 --> 01:03:29,920
Dewey.

763
01:03:30,086 --> 01:03:33,089
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me.

764
01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:36,217
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

765
01:03:36,384 --> 01:03:39,804
Now leave, and take
your media mouth with you.

766
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:44,182
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

767
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:46,267
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

768
01:03:46,434 --> 01:03:48,729
- Hey.
- Hey.

769
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:51,731
I need a camera.

770
01:03:51,898 --> 01:03:54,734
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

771
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:58,613
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

772
01:04:01,157 --> 01:04:04,535
- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one I want.

773
01:04:04,701 --> 01:04:08,080
Too bad, I've spoken

774
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:10,749
When I look at you
you're forgiven

775
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:30,267
You're forgiven

776
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:51,829
Jesus!

777
01:04:54,164 --> 01:04:56,750
Tatum, it's okay.

778
01:05:06,092 --> 01:05:08,469
Shit.

779
01:05:12,015 --> 01:05:13,933
Hey, shitheads!

780
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:17,436
Hello!

781
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:21,689
Shit. Piss.

782
01:05:39,623 --> 01:05:43,084
Is that you, Randy?

783
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:46,588
Cute. What movie is this from?
"l Spit On Your Garage?"

784
01:05:48,089 --> 01:05:51,551
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

785
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:54,554
Oh, you wanna play
psycho killer?

786
01:05:54,721 --> 01:05:57,265
Can I be
the helpless victim?

787
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:01,185
Okay, let's see-- No, please
don't kill me, Mr Ghost Face.

788
01:06:01,351 --> 01:06:03,812
I wanna be in the sequel!

789
01:06:05,272 --> 01:06:08,442
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.

790
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,653
Randy, what the hell
are you doing?

791
01:06:16,783 --> 01:06:19,035
Stop!

792
01:06:28,047 --> 01:06:30,591
Fucker!

793
01:07:10,016 --> 01:07:12,977
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

794
01:07:13,144 --> 01:07:15,980
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here but us chickens!

795
01:07:16,147 --> 01:07:19,024
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

796
01:07:21,109 --> 01:07:23,612
Oh. Billy. Hey.

797
01:07:23,779 --> 01:07:26,740
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?

798
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:29,158
I was hoping I could talk
to Sid alone.

799
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:31,702
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

800
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:34,164
I tell you what. Why don't you guys
go up to my parents' room?

801
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:39,168
You know, you guys
can talk, whatever.

802
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:42,504
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.

803
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:44,840
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.

804
01:07:55,016 --> 01:07:58,895
- What's Leatherface doin' here?
- Cute. He came to make up.

805
01:07:59,061 --> 01:08:01,897
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.

806
01:08:02,064 --> 01:08:04,067
As if.
That's all I'm sayin'.

807
01:08:04,233 --> 01:08:06,152
As if.

808
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:09,071
Oh, really, Alicia?

809
01:08:09,238 --> 01:08:12,032
"As if."
I'm gonna go check on them.

810
01:08:12,198 --> 01:08:15,911
- Come on!
- Okay, everyone.
It was nice to meet all of you.

811
01:08:16,078 --> 01:08:18,329
- Thank you.
- Stick around.

812
01:08:18,496 --> 01:08:20,665
You're a genius.

813
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:23,542
- Oh, shit.
- What?

814
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:25,837
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

815
01:08:26,004 --> 01:08:29,006
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

816
01:08:29,173 --> 01:08:31,174
- It'll be fine. Just record it.
- All right.

817
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:34,511
Oh, the placement is perfect.
Tell me, Kenneth--

818
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:38,015
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

819
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:42,268
- Well, first time for everything.
- You're damn right.

820
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:50,860
S-So, um--

821
01:08:53,612 --> 01:08:55,530
So--

822
01:08:57,866 --> 01:09:00,786
Look, I'm sorry.

823
01:09:00,952 --> 01:09:05,081
I've been selfish,
and I want to apologize.

824
01:09:05,248 --> 01:09:08,043
No, Billy, l-l'm...

825
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:11,671
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...

826
01:09:11,837 --> 01:09:14,214
with all this
post-traumatic stress.

827
01:09:15,966 --> 01:09:19,511
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.

828
01:09:19,678 --> 01:09:21,597
Enough is enough.
I--

829
01:09:21,763 --> 01:09:24,891
I can't wallow in-in
the grief process forever...

830
01:09:25,058 --> 01:09:26,976
and--

831
01:09:29,104 --> 01:09:34,692
and I can't keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

832
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:41,323
Yeah, I think I'm really...

833
01:09:42,908 --> 01:09:45,076
scared...

834
01:09:45,243 --> 01:09:48,496
that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?

835
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:53,251
Like "The Bad Seed"
or somethin'.

836
01:09:53,418 --> 01:09:56,253
And I know--
I know it doesn't make sense.

837
01:09:57,504 --> 01:09:59,423
Yeah, it does.

838
01:10:03,385 --> 01:10:06,721
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"...

839
01:10:06,888 --> 01:10:10,725
when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.

840
01:10:10,892 --> 01:10:14,896
But this is life.
This isn't a movie.

841
01:10:15,063 --> 01:10:17,398
Sure it is, Sid.

842
01:10:17,565 --> 01:10:19,483
It's all--
It's all a movie.

843
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,568
It's all...

844
01:10:21,735 --> 01:10:23,654
one great big movie.

845
01:10:30,118 --> 01:10:32,453
Only you can't pick
your genre.

846
01:10:59,062 --> 01:11:01,480
Why can't I be
a Meg Ryan movie?

847
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:07,486
Or even a good porno.

848
01:11:11,406 --> 01:11:13,992
- What?
- You heard me.

849
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:24,960
Are you sure?

850
01:11:26,212 --> 01:11:28,256
Yeah.

851
01:11:28,423 --> 01:11:31,217
I think so.

852
01:11:46,689 --> 01:11:48,858
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.

853
01:11:50,443 --> 01:11:52,570
Oh, man.
The colour of the blood is all wrong!

854
01:11:52,736 --> 01:11:55,239
Why do they do that?
It's too red!

855
01:11:55,405 --> 01:11:58,742
Wait. Here comes another.
Here it-- Here it--

856
01:11:58,909 --> 01:12:00,828
- Ooh!
- Yes! Yes!

857
01:12:00,994 --> 01:12:03,205
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.

858
01:12:03,371 --> 01:12:05,665
How can you watch this shit
over and over?

859
01:12:05,832 --> 01:12:08,376
When do we see breasts?
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.

860
01:12:08,543 --> 01:12:11,212
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Yes. Yes.
- Breasts?

861
01:12:11,379 --> 01:12:13,673
Not until "Trading Places"
in '83.

862
01:12:13,839 --> 01:12:16,175
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

863
01:12:16,341 --> 01:12:18,510
She never showed her tits
till she went legits.

864
01:12:18,678 --> 01:12:21,805
- Could afford a decent pair.
- What did you--

865
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:24,808
That's why she always
outsmarted the killer in
the big chase scene at the end.

866
01:12:24,975 --> 01:12:27,268
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

867
01:12:27,435 --> 01:12:29,813
- What rules?
- You don--

868
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,525
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?

869
01:12:34,692 --> 01:12:36,652
Have an aneurysm,
why don't ya?

870
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:39,404
There are certain rules
that one must abide by...

871
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:41,991
in order to successfully
survive a horror movie.

872
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,702
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.

873
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:51,917
- Big no-no! Big no-no!
- I'd be a dead man.

874
01:12:52,084 --> 01:12:54,002
- Sex equals death. Okay?
- Yes!

875
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,088
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.

876
01:12:59,882 --> 01:13:01,926
No, the sin factor.

877
01:13:02,093 --> 01:13:04,345
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

878
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:07,222
And number three:
Never, ever, ever...

879
01:13:07,389 --> 01:13:10,725
under any circumstances say,
"l'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.

880
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:13,562
- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

881
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:16,064
I'll be right back!

882
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,192
You see? You push the laws
and you end up dead.

883
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:22,277
Okay? I'll see you
in the kitchen with a knife.

884
01:13:22,445 --> 01:13:25,781
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

885
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:28,325
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

886
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:30,952
You don't know the rules?
There are certain rules...

887
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:34,581
- that one must abide by in order
to essentially survive a horror movie.
- Boring.

888
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:39,794
- For instance--
- The sheriff just radioed.

889
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:43,547
Somebody reported a car
in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.

890
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:47,051
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

891
01:13:47,218 --> 01:13:49,595
If you're sure
it's all right.

892
01:13:49,762 --> 01:13:52,639
Ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.

893
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:57,144
Be right back.

894
01:13:59,688 --> 01:14:01,814
You see, you push the laws
and you end up dead.

895
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:04,818
- W-- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?

896
01:14:04,985 --> 01:14:06,903
I thought maybe we'd walk.

897
01:14:08,696 --> 01:14:11,907
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.

898
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:18,497
- You're not scared, are ya?
- No.

899
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:21,082
- All right.
- Great.

900
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,172
Do you know what
that constellation is?

901
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:29,382
No. What is it?

902
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:32,676
I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.

903
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:39,058
- What happened to Tatum, Stu?
- She probably got pissed
at me and bailed.

904
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,143
- Bye.
- Bye.

905
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,813
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

906
01:15:01,453 --> 01:15:04,372
Look! Here comes
the obligatory tit shot!

907
01:15:08,126 --> 01:15:10,045
- Yes! Oh! That was beautiful!
- Lovely!

908
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,715
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

909
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:17,801
You are so...

910
01:15:19,387 --> 01:15:21,305
amazing.

911
01:15:27,185 --> 01:15:30,147
Hello? Yeah?

912
01:15:34,567 --> 01:15:36,486
Holy shit.

913
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:41,866
N-- Ho--
Listen up.

914
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:44,869
They found
Principal Himbry dead.

915
01:15:54,969 --> 01:15:57,096
We were just gettin'
to the good part.

916
01:15:57,263 --> 01:16:00,641
Hello? Yeah?

917
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,567
Where are you guys--

918
01:16:23,703 --> 01:16:26,790
Heigh-ho, Silver!
Let's go!

919
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:31,169
- So, is-- is Dewey your real name?
- No, it's Dwight.

920
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:32,795
Dwight?

921
01:16:32,962 --> 01:16:35,506
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

922
01:16:35,673 --> 01:16:39,343
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.

923
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:41,429
Well, I like it.

924
01:16:41,595 --> 01:16:43,847
It's sexy.

925
01:16:44,014 --> 01:16:46,601
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.

926
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:50,103
Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.

927
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:52,606
What about Gale Weathers?

928
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:55,775
Sounds like I'm
a meteorologist or something.

929
01:16:57,235 --> 01:17:02,240
People treat me like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.

930
01:17:02,406 --> 01:17:04,825
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?
- No.

931
01:17:04,992 --> 01:17:07,411
I think that's just 'cause
you kinda like me.

932
01:17:07,577 --> 01:17:10,247
They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!

933
01:17:10,414 --> 01:17:12,332
Freeze! Jump!

934
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:20,006
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

935
01:17:32,142 --> 01:17:34,478
I'm sorry.
I'm on duty.

936
01:17:43,695 --> 01:17:46,113
Is that what
you're looking for?

937
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,199
My whole life.

938
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,581
- Damn!
- What?

939
01:17:55,747 --> 01:17:57,666
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

940
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,959
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

941
01:18:01,545 --> 01:18:03,463
Jesus.
What's he doing here?

942
01:18:05,173 --> 01:18:07,091
We gotta get back.

943
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,639
You okay?

944
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:16,100
Yeah.

945
01:18:16,267 --> 01:18:18,185
Yeah, I'm fine.

946
01:18:28,778 --> 01:18:32,448
- Who'd you call?
- What?

947
01:18:32,616 --> 01:18:36,202
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested
you're allowed one phone call.

948
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:38,912
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?

949
01:18:40,998 --> 01:18:42,916
Called my dad.

950
01:18:45,085 --> 01:18:48,588
No, um, Sheriff Burke
called your dad. I saw him.

951
01:18:51,424 --> 01:18:54,803
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.

952
01:19:06,063 --> 01:19:09,024
You don't still think
it was me, do you?

953
01:19:12,527 --> 01:19:15,322
No.

954
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:17,574
No. I was just thinking...

955
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:21,410
if it were you it'd be a very
clever way to throw me off track.

956
01:19:21,577 --> 01:19:27,458
You know, using your one phone call
to call me so that I wouldn't
think it was you, that's all.

957
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:29,668
Really.

958
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:41,012
What do I have to do to prove
to you that I'm not a killer?

959
01:19:42,597 --> 01:19:45,182
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?

960
01:19:47,018 --> 01:19:49,770
- Oh, my God.
- Sidney--
- Billy, watch out!

961
01:19:56,113 --> 01:19:58,323
Sid.

962
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,859
Shit!

963
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,908
Help me, somebody!
Help me!

964
01:20:57,175 --> 01:20:59,760
Help me!

965
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:34,085
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.

966
01:21:34,252 --> 01:21:36,420
Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.

967
01:21:36,587 --> 01:21:39,464
You-- You know--
Look--

968
01:21:39,631 --> 01:21:42,008
Look, there he is.
I told you.

969
01:21:42,175 --> 01:21:44,761
I told you he was
right around the corner.

970
01:21:44,928 --> 01:21:46,846
Jamie. Jamie.

971
01:21:48,348 --> 01:21:51,976
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.

972
01:21:52,142 --> 01:21:54,645
Turn around.
Behind you.

973
01:21:54,812 --> 01:21:59,066
All the time!
Behind you!

974
01:21:59,233 --> 01:22:01,651
Behind you, Jamie.

975
01:22:01,818 --> 01:22:05,656
Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.

976
01:22:05,823 --> 01:22:08,491
Help me! Help!

977
01:22:20,586 --> 01:22:23,588
Let me in!

978
01:22:23,755 --> 01:22:26,549
- The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.

979
01:22:26,717 --> 01:22:30,804
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!

980
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,681
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.

981
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:37,727
- Jamie. Jamie.
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

982
01:22:37,894 --> 01:22:40,605
- Behind ya!
- Look around!

983
01:22:42,648 --> 01:22:45,901
- Shit.
- What?
- We're on 30-second delay.

984
01:22:46,067 --> 01:22:48,529
Oh, my God.

985
01:23:41,243 --> 01:23:44,663
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

986
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:48,291
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

987
01:23:49,876 --> 01:23:51,794
Be careful!

988
01:24:04,974 --> 01:24:06,892
Neil?

989
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:14,316
Mr Prescott?

990
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:18,403
Shit!

991
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:36,337
Kenny, I need the cellular!

992
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:42,925
Kenny!

993
01:24:43,092 --> 01:24:45,010
Kenny!

994
01:25:10,034 --> 01:25:12,995
- 9-1-1.
- What's going on?

995
01:25:25,548 --> 01:25:27,383
Oh, God!

996
01:26:02,427 --> 01:26:04,720
Dewey!

997
01:26:04,887 --> 01:26:06,805
Dewey, where are you?

998
01:26:09,016 --> 01:26:11,852
Dewey!

999
01:26:12,019 --> 01:26:14,521
Sidney?

1000
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:20,652
Dewey!

1001
01:26:48,302 --> 01:26:50,679
Shit!

1002
01:27:15,953 --> 01:27:19,873
7825, suspect at
105 North Avenue 52.

1003
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,834
Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.

1004
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:27,256
It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's gonna try and kill me.

1005
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:52,987
Sidney!
Sidney!

1006
01:27:53,154 --> 01:27:55,490
Jesus, we've got to get
the fuck out of here!

1007
01:27:55,657 --> 01:27:58,868
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead.

1008
01:27:59,035 --> 01:28:01,996
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!
- Stay back!

1009
01:28:02,163 --> 01:28:04,873
- Stu did it. He killed Billy!
He killed my Tatum!
- You did it!

1010
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,793
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!
- You lie!

1011
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,546
Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!
Give me that gun! Christ, man!

1012
01:28:11,713 --> 01:28:14,799
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!

1013
01:28:14,966 --> 01:28:18,386
He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1014
01:28:18,553 --> 01:28:21,014
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!

1015
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:24,642
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!

1016
01:28:24,808 --> 01:28:28,021
- Open up!
- He did it!

1017
01:28:28,187 --> 01:28:31,232
Help me!
He's going crazy!

1018
01:28:31,398 --> 01:28:33,358
- Sidney!
- Go away!

1019
01:28:33,525 --> 01:28:35,735
Sidney?

1020
01:28:35,902 --> 01:28:37,821
Leave me alone.

1021
01:28:43,493 --> 01:28:45,911
- Sid.
- Billy.

1022
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:54,128
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?

1023
01:28:54,294 --> 01:28:57,047
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.

1024
01:28:57,213 --> 01:28:59,925
No, I'm like a stuck pig,
but I'm all right.

1025
01:29:00,092 --> 01:29:02,094
- Get up.
- Help me.

1026
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:05,221
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

1027
01:29:05,388 --> 01:29:07,932
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.
- No, he's out there.

1028
01:29:08,099 --> 01:29:10,602
No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.

1029
01:29:10,768 --> 01:29:12,812
It's okay. It's okay.

1030
01:29:12,979 --> 01:29:14,897
Careful.

1031
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:18,692
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!

1032
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:20,986
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!

1033
01:29:23,488 --> 01:29:25,573
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

1034
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,117
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1035
01:29:34,707 --> 01:29:36,876
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho."

1036
01:29:43,882 --> 01:29:47,594
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in "Carrie."

1037
01:29:51,889 --> 01:29:54,350
Stu.
Help me, please.

1038
01:29:57,144 --> 01:30:00,064
Surprise, Sidney.

1039
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:05,903
- No!
- Ooh!

1040
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:08,655
Oh, now. Whoa.

1041
01:30:11,282 --> 01:30:15,287
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1042
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:18,664
- Why are you doing this?
- It's all part of the game, Sidney.

1043
01:30:18,831 --> 01:30:21,500
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die."
- Fuck you!

1044
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:26,172
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?

1045
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:29,341
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.

1046
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:32,385
See, we ask you a question,
and if you get it wrong...

1047
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:34,638
"boo-kah," you die!

1048
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:37,766
You get it right,
you die.

1049
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:41,435
- You're crazy, both of you.
- Actually, we prefer
the term "psychotic."

1050
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:45,440
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?

1051
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:48,734
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1052
01:30:48,901 --> 01:30:51,570
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1053
01:30:51,695 --> 01:30:55,531
Watch a few movies,
take a few notes.

1054
01:30:55,699 --> 01:30:57,951
- It was fun.
- No!

1055
01:30:58,118 --> 01:31:01,454
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?

1056
01:31:01,621 --> 01:31:05,666
Why? Why did you kill my mother?

1057
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:10,254
Why? Why?

1058
01:31:10,421 --> 01:31:14,382
Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1059
01:31:14,549 --> 01:31:17,594
Well, I don't really believe
in motive, Sid. I mean,
did Norman Bates have a motive?

1060
01:31:17,761 --> 01:31:20,847
- No.
- Did they ever really decide why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?

1061
01:31:21,014 --> 01:31:26,393
Don't think so! See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1062
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,480
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slut-bag whore...

1063
01:31:29,647 --> 01:31:32,566
who flashed her shit all over town like
she was Sharon Stone or something.

1064
01:31:32,733 --> 01:31:34,902
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney...

1065
01:31:35,068 --> 01:31:38,405
your mother
was no Sharon Stone, hmm?

1066
01:31:43,702 --> 01:31:46,079
Is that motive enough
for you?

1067
01:31:48,497 --> 01:31:51,251
Well, how about this?

1068
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:55,087
Your slut mother
was fucking my father...

1069
01:31:57,047 --> 01:32:00,593
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1070
01:32:02,803 --> 01:32:05,972
How's that for a motive?

1071
01:32:06,139 --> 01:32:08,182
Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behaviour.

1072
01:32:08,349 --> 01:32:11,728
It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1073
01:32:11,895 --> 01:32:16,190
That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin.

1074
01:32:16,357 --> 01:32:18,275
I said "virgin."
Whoops!

1075
01:32:18,442 --> 01:32:21,279
Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.

1076
01:32:21,445 --> 01:32:25,532
Let's pretend it's all a scary movie,
Sid. How do you think it's gonna end?

1077
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:32,414
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1078
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:34,958
We got a surprise
for you, Sidney.

1079
01:32:35,124 --> 01:32:37,918
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1080
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:41,881
Hold on a sec.
I'll be right back.

1081
01:32:42,048 --> 01:32:43,966
You know what time
it is, Sid?

1082
01:32:44,133 --> 01:32:46,051
It's after midnight.

1083
01:32:46,218 --> 01:32:49,804
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.

1084
01:32:49,971 --> 01:32:53,225
We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1085
01:32:53,392 --> 01:32:57,312
Attention! Oh, what do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1086
01:32:57,478 --> 01:33:01,607
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it. That's enough.

1087
01:33:01,774 --> 01:33:04,277
Guess we won't be needing
this any more, huh?

1088
01:33:04,444 --> 01:33:07,613
And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.

1089
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:09,781
- Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?
- Come on, Sidney.

1090
01:33:09,948 --> 01:33:14,703
You think about it now, huh?
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1091
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:17,706
- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?

1092
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:21,459
Your mother's anniversary
set him off, and he went on
a murder spree, killing everyone.

1093
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,794
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1094
01:33:23,961 --> 01:33:27,006
Then he kills you...

1095
01:33:27,173 --> 01:33:29,717
and shoots himself
in the head.

1096
01:33:29,883 --> 01:33:33,428
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.

1097
01:33:33,595 --> 01:33:35,514
Watch this.

1098
01:33:39,559 --> 01:33:43,688
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!

1099
01:33:43,854 --> 01:33:47,817
Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!

1100
01:33:52,738 --> 01:33:55,198
Good one, man. Jesus.

1101
01:33:55,365 --> 01:33:59,286
Oh, shit.
My turn.

1102
01:34:01,955 --> 01:34:04,457
Don't forget. Stay to the side
and don't go too deep.

1103
01:34:06,167 --> 01:34:08,169
Okay. I'll remember.

1104
01:34:09,337 --> 01:34:12,673
Fuck! Fuck!

1105
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:15,217
Fuck!
Goddamn it, Stu!

1106
01:34:15,384 --> 01:34:19,471
Sorry, Billy. I guess I got
a little too zealous, huh?

1107
01:34:19,638 --> 01:34:22,516
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1108
01:34:22,682 --> 01:34:25,727
Give me the knife!

1109
01:34:27,311 --> 01:34:30,231
Now!

1110
01:34:31,649 --> 01:34:36,195
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.

1111
01:34:36,361 --> 01:34:38,906
We get to carry on
and plan the sequel...

1112
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:43,201
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days ya gotta have a sequel!

1113
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:48,831
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1114
01:34:48,998 --> 01:34:51,418
Now, Sid, don't you
blame the movies.

1115
01:34:51,584 --> 01:34:53,084
Movies don't create psychos.

1116
01:34:53,591 --> 01:34:57,261
I feel a little woozy here!

1117
01:35:00,097 --> 01:35:02,097
All right, you get the gun.

1118
01:35:02,935 --> 01:35:04,979
And I'll untie Pops, okay?

1119
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:10,525
- Now!
- Okay.

1120
01:35:22,369 --> 01:35:25,957
Houston, we--
we have a problem here.

1121
01:35:28,042 --> 01:35:30,544
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.

1122
01:35:30,711 --> 01:35:34,214
I put it right there,
and it's not there.

1123
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:37,551
- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.

1124
01:35:40,053 --> 01:35:42,638
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.

1125
01:35:42,805 --> 01:35:45,475
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.

1126
01:35:45,642 --> 01:35:48,561
The reporter left for dead
in the news van...

1127
01:35:48,728 --> 01:35:50,688
comes to...

1128
01:35:50,854 --> 01:35:55,316
stumbles on you two dipshits,
finds the gun...

1129
01:35:55,483 --> 01:36:00,197
foils your plan
and saves the day.

1130
01:36:00,363 --> 01:36:03,574
I like that ending.

1131
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:06,661
I know something
you don't.

1132
01:36:08,663 --> 01:36:11,207
Fuck. No!

1133
01:36:14,126 --> 01:36:16,336
Yeah, man.

1134
01:36:16,503 --> 01:36:20,174
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.

1135
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:29,766
It works better
without the safety on.

1136
01:36:36,355 --> 01:36:38,482
This is Gale Weathers
signing off.

1137
01:36:38,649 --> 01:36:40,651
Babe, you're gonna
love this!

1138
01:36:43,028 --> 01:36:44,946
Shit.

1139
01:36:46,614 --> 01:36:48,532
What?

1140
01:36:54,372 --> 01:36:56,707
Where are they?
Where are they?

1141
01:36:56,874 --> 01:36:58,792
I don't know, Billy,
but I'm hurtin', man.

1142
01:36:58,959 --> 01:37:02,129
Fuck!

1143
01:37:02,296 --> 01:37:05,841
Shall I let
the machine get it?

1144
01:37:06,007 --> 01:37:08,676
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

1145
01:37:08,843 --> 01:37:11,054
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?

1146
01:37:11,221 --> 01:37:14,057
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.

1147
01:37:14,224 --> 01:37:18,561
It's called "Guess Who Just
Called The Police And Reported
Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass."

1148
01:37:18,727 --> 01:37:22,690
- Find her, you dipshit! Get up!
- I can't, Billy.
You already cut me too deep.

1149
01:37:22,857 --> 01:37:24,942
I think I'm dying here, man.

1150
01:37:28,153 --> 01:37:30,071
Talk to her.
Talk to her.

1151
01:37:37,036 --> 01:37:40,581
- Hello?
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.

1152
01:37:40,748 --> 01:37:42,667
What's your motive?
Billy's got one.

1153
01:37:42,834 --> 01:37:44,877
The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?

1154
01:37:45,044 --> 01:37:47,337
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.

1155
01:37:47,504 --> 01:37:49,798
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch,
just like your fucking mother!

1156
01:37:49,965 --> 01:37:53,469
- You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!

1157
01:37:53,635 --> 01:37:57,806
Ow. You fuckin' hit me
with the phone, dick!

1158
01:37:57,972 --> 01:37:59,891
Fucker, where are you?

1159
01:38:01,559 --> 01:38:03,478
You fuck!

1160
01:38:05,063 --> 01:38:08,983
- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.

1161
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:12,360
My mom and dad are
gonna be so mad at me.

1162
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:15,906
Bitch!

1163
01:39:12,541 --> 01:39:14,585
My arm!

1164
01:39:21,675 --> 01:39:24,010
I always had
a thing for ya, Sid!

1165
01:39:44,376 --> 01:39:46,879
- I'm sorry. It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Randy.
I thought you were dead.

1166
01:39:47,046 --> 01:39:50,465
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1167
01:39:52,175 --> 01:39:55,052
Fucker!

1168
01:39:59,891 --> 01:40:02,476
Say hello to your mother.

1169
01:40:40,388 --> 01:40:43,140
Guess I remembered
the safety that time, you bastard.

1170
01:40:56,069 --> 01:40:58,196
Careful. This is the moment...

1171
01:40:58,363 --> 01:41:03,117
when the supposedly dead killer comes
back to life for one last scare.

1172
01:41:08,247 --> 01:41:11,125
Not in my movie.

1173
01:41:15,796 --> 01:41:19,424
Dad.
Randy, help me out.

1174
01:41:24,095 --> 01:41:27,473
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?

1175
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:30,310
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1176
01:41:31,853 --> 01:41:33,771
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1177
01:41:36,398 --> 01:41:38,400
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.

1178
01:41:38,566 --> 01:41:43,196
Okay, I think it's going to go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1179
01:41:43,363 --> 01:41:46,658
Hi, this is Gale Weathers
with an exclusive eyewitness account...

1180
01:41:46,824 --> 01:41:49,660
of this amazing breaking story.

1181
01:41:49,827 --> 01:41:52,163
Several more local teens
are dead...

1182
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:55,166
bringing to an end the harrowing
mystery of the mass killing...

1183
01:41:55,332 --> 01:41:57,835
that has terrified
this peaceful community...

1184
01:41:58,001 --> 01:42:00,670
Iike the plot
of some scary movie.

1185
01:42:00,795 --> 01:42:03,257
It all began with
a scream over 9-1-1...

1186
01:42:03,424 --> 01:42:07,594
and ended in a bloodbath that has
rocked the town of Woodsboro...

1187
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,179
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse...

1188
01:42:10,346 --> 01:42:12,849
far from the crimes and
the sirens of the larger cities...

1189
01:42:13,016 --> 01:42:15,018
that its residents
had fled.

1190
01:42:15,184 --> 01:42:17,770
Okay, let's take it back to one.
Come on. Move it.

1191
01:42:17,937 --> 01:42:20,522
This is my big shot.
Let's go.

1191
01:42:21,305 --> 01:42:27,306
