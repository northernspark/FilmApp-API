Ooh, a week in Hawaii.
l'll fill in for you.

6
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:42,458
Are you sure?

7
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:46,401
You just take your honeymoon
before l change my mind.

8
00:00:46,436 --> 00:00:48,404

Next in line, please.

11
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,690
Hey, Darnell. l didn't know
you had an account here.

12
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:14,288
As a matter of fact, l never
saw you out of the projects.

13
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:17,562
Shut the fuck up
and empty the fucking drawer!

14
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,569
Empty the drawer!

15
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:21,195
Next in line, please.

16
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:24,240
Come on, Darnell.

17
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:27,209
Darnell, don't do this.

18
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,773
Now come on. Stop, please.

19
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:34,443
Why are you playing?
lt's not a fucking game.

20
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:35,883
Empty the fucking drawer!

21
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:40,379
Hell, no.
l want nothing to do with this.

22
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:50,632
Everyone get on
the fucking floor now!

23
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,225
Get the fuck on the floor!

24
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,134
Give me the money!

25
00:01:56,172 --> 00:01:58,436
Come on.
Let's get this money, baby!

26
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:00,739
-Now!
-Get your ass on the floor.

27
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:03,007
Give him the money.

28
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,945
Lay your ass down! Stay there!

29
00:02:05,982 --> 00:02:07,244
Hurry up!

30
00:02:21,464 --> 00:02:23,455
Fill it up!

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,660
Give him the money!

32
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,300
Give him the money, bitch!

33
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:28,736
And hurry up, God damn it!

34
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:30,569
l said, hurry up!

35
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:33,874
Give us everything
in the drawer.

36
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,310
Oh, my God!

37
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:38,405
-Don't cry now.
-Hurry it up!

38
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:40,881
Here. Here. Take it.

39
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,181
lt's yours. Go! Go! Go!

40
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:44,584
Shit.

41
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,932
Oh, my God!

42
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,172
Come on, man!

43
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,082
Everybody stay down!

44
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,104
ls everyone OK?

45
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:08,899
Why don't we take it
from the top?

46
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,064
l thought we covered everything.

47
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:13,041
How well did you know
the perpetrator?

48
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:16,045
l've just known Darnell
from around the way is all.

49
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,343
We live in the same projects.

50
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:20,076
Frankie, will you do me a favor?

51
00:04:20,116 --> 00:04:22,710
Just tell me one thing,
and we'll get out of here.

52
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:26,216
Sure.

53
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,190
What's the procedure
when you're being robbed?

54
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:30,786
Look, sir--

55
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:32,522
Stop! Stop! Stop!

56
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:33,722
Now...

57
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:38,422
what's the procedure
when you're being robbed?

58
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,104
You pull the money clip
from your right-hand drawer...

59
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:50,908
and then you signal
with the left hand.

60
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:52,778
You signal with the left.

61
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,943
So you know the procedure.

62
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:58,750
Yes. The procedure has been
told to me over a million times.

63
00:04:58,788 --> 00:04:59,948
So why is it...

64
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,788
if that procedure's
been drummed into your head...

65
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:07,854
a million times--
you got that procedure down--

66
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:09,228
why wouldn't you follow it?

67
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,258
Because he had a gun!

68
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:17,399
And l went for my clip,
but he shot her.

69
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:21,073
He shot her
right in front of me.

70
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,376
l'm afraid we're going
to have to let you go.

71
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,317
That you knew the perpetrator
doesn't sit well with us.

72
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:31,377
Wait. But that's not right.

73
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,719
l haven't done anything wrong!

74
00:05:33,756 --> 00:05:36,224
l can't help who l know!

75
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:39,888
Mr. Zachary, just last week,
you gave me a promotion...

76
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,897
and now you're going
to take my job away?

77
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:44,297
What happens the next time one
of your friends robs the bank?

78
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:46,928
How do we know
you're not in collusion?

79
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,701
Collusion?
Let me tell you something--

80
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,231
l am here at 2:20 sharp
every morning...

81
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:56,507
and l work my ass off
until quitting time.

82
00:05:56,546 --> 00:06:01,279
Yesterday, l counted
$240,000 by hand for you!

83
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,044
That's how you should know!

84
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,578
l mean...

85
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:09,751
come on!
This is just not right!

86
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:14,024
l nearly got blown away in
your tight-ass fucking bank...

87
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:16,031
and you're going to fire me?

88
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,898
-Calm down.
-You couldn't even wait!

89
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:32,408
You didn't even bother to ask me
if l was thirsty, sister.

90
00:06:35,585 --> 00:06:38,076
She's involved. l want
everything you have on her.

91
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:37,977
l thought l said
a Seventies graduation party.

92
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:40,346
Seventies, Halloween.
What's the difference?

93
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:43,009
You're the only one
in the neighborhood...

94
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:45,043
to give a Seventies
graduation party.

95
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:47,556
Anyway, T.T., Jajuan...

96
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,217
y'all look
awfully groovy tonight.

97
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:50,725
You like it, girl?

98
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,228
Thank you
for following directions.

99
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:55,093
Simple directions.

100
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,061
Look at him. Ain't he fine?

101
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,332
Just as handsome
as he wants to be.

102
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,497
l know it.

103
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:04,301
Can you believe
he's going to college?

104
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:08,833
Man, l remember when
you was just a little scrub...

105
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:12,507
always trying
to follow us around and shit.

106
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:14,641
On that tricycle.

107
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:17,050
Y'all always trying
to mess up somebody's game.

108
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:18,610
Please.

109
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,520
What game?

110
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,547
Whatever.

111
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:26,522
Stony,
you got a ten l can borrow?

112
00:08:26,562 --> 00:08:28,325
We need some more chips.
Stuff running out.

113
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:29,558
Come on, college boy.

114
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,329
You're the one that's
going to be making all the loot.

115
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:34,427
You have to stop
spoiling that boy.

116
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,132
You've been taking care of him
since your mama and daddy died.

117
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:52,847
What you got?

118
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,516
You ain't drinking
none of this shit.

119
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,567
Stevie, what's the problem?

120
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,336
l'm not going.

121
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:17,177
l ain't going to college.

122
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:20,011
What? All right, look.

123
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:23,314
Don't start tripping, OK?
You cannot change your mind.

124
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:25,843
We got into UCLA,
and that's where we're going.

125
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:28,584
l ain't changed my mind.
l didn't get a scholarship.

126
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:31,450
They didn't give you
a scholarship?

127
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,020
But we told them
the only way we could apply--

128
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:36,554
l know.

129
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,203
All right.
Well, don't worry about it.

130
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:47,573
l'll take care of it.

131
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:51,206
lt's probably just because
l'm a January graduate.

132
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:52,407
How are you going
to take care of it?

133
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:54,507
You can barely pay the bills
around here.

134
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,383
l'll just get a job.
l'll help around here until--

135
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:02,517
No. Wrong. We're going
to stick to the plan...

136
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:04,719
and we are definitely
getting you up out of here.

137
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:19,401
l ain't hearing what this fool--

138
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:21,933
Good afternoon, ladies...

139
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:25,414
and gentlemen.

140
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,179
All right. Listen up.

141
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:35,783
Now, these good white folks
are trying to recycle...

142
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:39,022
all of their glasses,
plastics, and aluminum...

143
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,094
and you bitches putting
all the shit in the dumpsters.

144
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:46,067
You gots to recycle.

145
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:48,400
Who had 104?

146
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,199
l did.

147
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,607
You didn't
empty the cans in 104.

148
00:10:54,644 --> 00:10:56,111
l'm docking your pay.

149
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:57,476
That ain't right.

150
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:58,639
Who are you supposed to be?

151
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:02,378
Goddamn Mighty Morphin
fucking Power Ranger?

152
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:05,319
What you going to do?
l'm docking her pay!

153
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:09,415
Speaking of pay,
l thought you said...

154
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,723
that you was going to pay me
under the table.

155
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:14,992
They're taking taxes
out of my check.

156
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,363
l don't even got enough money
to pay for my baby-sitter.

157
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,561
On this good earth...

158
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:22,571
there are three peoples
l don't mess with...

159
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:25,574
the ''l,'' the ''R,'' and the ''S.''

160
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:27,235
But l got my baby-sitter!

161
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:32,578
lf you don't like working
for Luther's Janitorial...

162
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:35,743
why don't you just take
your broke ass home?

163
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:40,415
Otherwise, shut the fuck up
and get back to work!

164
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:43,357
You one cold-hearted
motherfucker, Luther.

165
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,916
Get back to work.

166
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,451
You didn't have
to talk to her like that!

167
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:51,761
Tisean, you have got to learn
to stand up for yourself.

168
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:55,432
Did y'all hear
what happened to Frankie?

169
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:57,666
Our Frankie?

170
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:59,607
Lorenz and them robbed a bank.

171
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:02,076
This kid's got 211s
in four cities.

172
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:04,545
He's wanted
in Nevada, Arizona...

173
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,277
He's damn near professional.
What's he, twenty-one?

174
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,411
-They're getting younger.
-Yeah?

175
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:13,388
l want everything you got
on his young ass--

176
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:17,017
where he hangs out,
who he knows, where mom lives.

177
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:18,686
Everything. l want it all.

178
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:20,753
Look at that. Check that out.

179
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:24,061
His hair. What is that?

180
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,967
''A...P''?

181
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:28,897
What's that, a nickname?

182
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:31,499
''Asshole, perhaps''?

183
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,775
Oh, fuck off.

184
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:57,528
Cleo...

185
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,466
when you gonna fix
this raggedy shit?

186
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,402
Never mind my shit, fool.

187
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,567
Frankie, l heard what happened
at the bank the other day.

188
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:06,768
Keep your head up, girl,
all right?

189
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,877
Up. Up.

190
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:14,574
Watch this motherfucker.

191
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:22,255
That's all right.
Your shit is original.

192
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,350
Damn right.

193
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:26,156
Don't worry,
my shit is going to be tight.

194
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:29,187
Cleo, you've been fixing up
this car since seventh grade.

195
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,397
Do you know Lorenz and them
got away with twenty grand?

196
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:36,234
Twenty? Jeez. Damn.

197
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:38,672
See, that's what the fuck
we need to do--

198
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,175
rob a bank.

199
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:42,803
No. That's crazy.

200
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:46,281
Really, though. The four of us
could take a bank.

201
00:13:47,683 --> 00:13:50,982
lf that crackhead Darnell
can rob a bank, we can.

202
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,681
Twenty Gs
would save my life right now.

203
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:55,589
Stevie needs tuition.

204
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:58,593
Well, too bad
we ain't some hard-up...

205
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:01,858
crackhead motherfuckers
like Lorenz and them.

206
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:05,697
Then we could do some
suicidal shit like rob a bank.

207
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:08,704
But we ain't crazy, so we can't.

208
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,729
So now you making the rules?

209
00:14:10,773 --> 00:14:13,207
Frankie, please!

210
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:15,005
Ain't nobody over here
going to be robbing no bank.

211
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:19,413
You're right.
We ain't going to rob no bank.

212
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:22,679
Let's just go in there
and blow it the fuck up!

213
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:26,248
Here you go.

214
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:29,416
Can you believe after working
at that bank for two years...

215
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,658
l can't get a recommendation
for another job?

216
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,129
All right, l'm going
to hook you up with Luther.

217
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:38,422
l know you ain't happy,
but you need a job.

218
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,697
Ursula, come here.

219
00:14:40,736 --> 00:14:42,601
How you doing, Ursula?

220
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:47,776
What's up?

221
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,611
What the fuck is up with that?
She don't talk?

222
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:54,411
Not really.

223
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:02,519
Girl, next time l page you,
you better be calling me back.

224
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:07,719
Excuse me. Drink, please.

225
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:11,199
What's up, girl?
That's a cute outfit.

226
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,292
Want some?

227
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:18,734
Hey, Stony, look, girl.

228
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:20,298
There's Nate Andrews.

229
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:28,714
Girl, didn't he want you
to work in his car lot for him?

230
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,413
Yes, and that's not all
he wanted.

231
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:38,253
You going over there?

232
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:44,260
Yeah. l'm going to see
what he wants.

233
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,744
So how much money could
l make selling cars for you?

234
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:02,842
Well, it depends.
l mean, you can make...

235
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:04,682
two Gs a month on commission.

236
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,416
-That much?
-Yeah!

237
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:10,619
l told you you needed to get
somebody who could help you.

238
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:13,492
Nate,
before l come work for you...

239
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,664
l need an advance.

240
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,194
There's a little problem
that l need to fix.

241
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,929
Oh! l can do that.

242
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:31,141
But l mean, Stony Newsome...

243
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,205
you got to give me
a reason to do that.

244
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:34,876
You know what l mean?

245
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,612
What would that be?

246
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:38,677
Come on, now. You know.

247
00:16:45,528 --> 00:16:47,689
Let's go for a ride, huh?

248
00:17:02,611 --> 00:17:04,044
So when do l get my advance?

249
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,516
l don't know.
Tomorrow. Maybe the day after.

250
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:12,043
Nate, before l do this,
l want my check.

251
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:14,954
Whoa. Look, you're not getting
no check from me...

252
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,924
until l'm done, you understand?

253
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,655
This ain't right.
lt's not even worth it.

254
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:21,390
Shit.

255
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:34,408
l'm in a bind, Nate.

256
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:36,274
Some other time.

257
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:49,983
l really need this money, Nate.

258
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:05,891
What the fuck is that?

259
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:08,095
lt's Frankie.
lt's her first night.

260
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,196
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

261
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:13,798
Look at this motherfucker.

262
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:17,377
Bet you he ain't never
held a broom in his life...

263
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:21,614
and she ain't did no dishes
or washed no clothes.

264
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,118
This is a ugly-ass baby!

265
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:28,180
You know, white people be
having some old water head...

266
00:19:28,223 --> 00:19:31,158
crying-ass, ugly babies.

267
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:33,718
l can't unload these things
without dropping them.

268
00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:34,956
Frankie, relax!

269
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:37,363
How can you stand
the smell of this garbage?

270
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,368
-The shit ain't that bad.
-Ain't that bad?

271
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,097
Cleo, you live in a garage!

272
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,729
Girl, it'll be OK.

273
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:46,570
And you--stay out of it.

274
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,247
Damn. Look at my nails!

275
00:19:55,284 --> 00:19:57,980
Shit, girl,
you been bitchin' all night.

276
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:02,647
Stony back there
acting all stank-a-dank-dank.

277
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:08,094
That's all right.
l got something for that here.

278
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:14,592
Ow, girl! That hurt.

279
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:21,207
That's the only way
you get the knot out.

280
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:23,837
Yep. l rolled this one good.

281
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:26,613
Blunt talking to me,
motherfucker.

282
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,941
Stop it, girl. Stinky.

283
00:20:30,986 --> 00:20:32,385
There.

284
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,458
Cleo, l done told you
l'm strictly dickly.

285
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:41,360
l'm going to tell Ursula.

286
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,365
You're going to tell nobody.

287
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:48,135
Check out Stony.
Look at her. Look at her.

288
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:52,272
Chronic always get her ass
all quiet.

289
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:54,605
Look at her sitting over there.

290
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:56,543
Hey, you fucked up,
ain't you, girl?

291
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:05,242
What?

292
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:07,912
What's wrong with them?

293
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,220
You know.
Every time we get high...

294
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:15,628
you start looking
like Sugar Bear.

295
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:16,961
For real.

296
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,401
Y'all cold.

297
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:22,301
You do kind of look like
Sugar Bear.

298
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:24,305
Fuck all y'all.

299
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:28,473
Simple bitches.

300
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,001
Cleo, don't get salty.

301
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:38,082
Damn.

302
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,350
Before they started
laying people off...

303
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:43,916
they was paying folks fifteen
dollars an hour at that place.

304
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,519
Man. That's good money!

305
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,360
For fifteen dollars an hour,
l'd be all...

306
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:52,264
''Fuck, l'm right here.

307
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,633
''What l gotta do,
Sir Ass Motherfucker?''

308
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:59,607
They'd have to pull me off
that damn machine.

309
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:00,972
Shit.

310
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:04,376
That overtime would be
twenty-two fifty an hour!

311
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:06,711
l don't know
what l'm going to do.

312
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:09,546
Now that Luther's
taking taxes out of my check...

313
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:12,577
l'm making half as much
as l used to.

314
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,957
Only way we going to see cash
is we take a bank.

315
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:19,984
Now, see, l'm with that shit.

316
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:22,496
Y'all niggers
done lost your mind.

317
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:24,465
We might as well not even talk
about this shit no more.

318
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,400
l'm talking about it.

319
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:29,165
Ain't nobody going to stop me
from talking about it.

320
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:31,900
Well, talk is cheap...

321
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:37,171
nigger.

322
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:43,747
Wait. l mean, you know?

323
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:46,253
Frankie,
you gonna get slapped.

324
00:22:46,288 --> 00:22:47,778
What?

325
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:49,916
You always talking shit.

326
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,927
You want to blow the bank up,
now you want to rob it.

327
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:55,725
Frankie want to blow up the bank

328
00:22:55,764 --> 00:22:57,664
Frankie want to rob the bank

329
00:23:02,804 --> 00:23:04,396
l ain't heard nothing
about that.

330
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,039
l said, hang up the phone.

331
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,274
You know who that is.

332
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:14,873
Yeah. l gotta go. l'll be over.

333
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,943
Don't drink up
my champagne, man. Peace.

334
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:19,146
Champagne?

335
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:21,981
Whatever. l ain't got time.

336
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:25,892
Look! Did your sister
come through for you or what?

337
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:27,725
-Where'd you get this?
-Don't worry about it.

338
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:30,459
Ain't none of your business.
Just look at the digits.

339
00:23:34,603 --> 00:23:35,900
Stony, there's something
l got to tell you.

340
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:38,065
Look, l know
this is hardly enough money...

341
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:39,733
but l will get every--

342
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:41,504
No. Listen to me.

343
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:45,474
l didn't get into UCLA...

344
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:49,041
and l'm not going
because l didn't get accepted.

345
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,578
You didn't get in?

346
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:56,090
Don't go off on me now.

347
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:58,684
Don't you tell me
not to go off on you!

348
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:03,728
Do you have any idea
what l had to go through?

349
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:05,426
Do you?

350
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:07,567
l'm not staying around for this.

351
00:24:07,603 --> 00:24:10,094
You are going to hang around
for this, so don't move.

352
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:18,071
Why did you have to lie to me?

353
00:24:18,113 --> 00:24:19,978
Stony, you know
how long you told me...

354
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:22,313
that l had to go to college?

355
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:26,378
Well, l'm sorry, but maybe
that life is just not for me.

356
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:39,358
Shit.

357
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,939
Who is it?

358
00:24:55,984 --> 00:24:57,781
Lorenz, it's Stevie, man.

359
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:00,454
Come on. Open up, man.

360
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,221
Hey, Lorenz, chill, man.

361
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:12,024
Hey, l heard you robbed a bank.

362
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,898
l didn't rob no bank.

363
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:16,903
l heard your party
was awful good.

364
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:22,577
You know why l didn't come.
Your sister don't like me.

365
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:24,101
She be trippin'.

366
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:26,507
Nah, she cool, man.

367
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:28,175
To let you tell it.

368
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,517
Here, Mr. UCLA.

369
00:25:35,557 --> 00:25:37,081
Here.

370
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:39,587
You all right?

371
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:43,295
-Yeah. l'm straight, man.
-All right.

372
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:49,426
Hey, that ''AP'' is phat.

373
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:52,897
''Acorn Projects.''
Man, l thought you knew!

374
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:54,806
Oh, well...

375
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:58,502
You want this?

376
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,947
No, man. l'm straight. No.

377
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:02,847
You know your sister
whup your ass.

378
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:05,318
My sister
ain't gonna do nothing.

379
00:26:06,354 --> 00:26:08,584
Tamika, hook him up.

380
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:10,420
He ain't from Acorn.

381
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:12,620
Fuck all that.

382
00:26:12,661 --> 00:26:15,289
Get the clippers,
hook his ass up.

383
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,730
Take your ass in the kitchen
with your raggly ass.

384
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:19,063
You talk too much.

385
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,526
Come on!

386
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,731
Ain't nothing funny, man.
Go on. You, too.

387
00:26:36,251 --> 00:26:38,719
All right, man.

388
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:41,086
Cool. Thanks for the champagne.

389
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:02,802
Freeze!

390
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:04,812
Get down on the ground!
Get down now!

391
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:19,360
Get him down! Get him down!

392
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,521
Get down!

393
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:25,591
-He's got a gun!
-Wait!

394
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:44,213
-Waller!
-Check apartment ''L'' now!

395
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:47,153
Get me an ambulance!
Get me a medic!

396
00:27:47,189 --> 00:27:50,215
-He's up there!
-Get me an ambulance now!

397
00:27:50,258 --> 00:27:51,657
Come on, God damn it!
Stay with me here!

398
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:56,656
Get me a fucking ambulance!

399
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:11,868
A fucking champagne bottle.

400
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:13,437
Open that, quick.

401
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:18,910
Get down!

402
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:21,582
Shit! l didn't do nothing!

403
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:47,938
Goddamn pigs!
What you fucking with me for?

404
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:52,581
-Man down!
-We've got it covered!

405
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:55,181
-Get in here!
-Go, go!

406
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:38,461
God, no!

407
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,438
What have you done?

408
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:04,555
Excuse me.

409
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:08,589
This motherfucker.

410
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:13,299
lf you need to talk,
if you have any questions...

411
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:14,666
l hope
you won't hesitate to call.

412
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:18,166
There will be
a full investigation.

413
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:23,134
-No!
-All right. OK.

414
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:26,341
Fuck you!
Fuck your investigation!

415
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,715
What have you got?

416
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:35,916
Stevie Newsome. No priors.

417
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:38,152
Good student.
Headed for college, l hear.

418
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:41,253
Both parents killed in
a car accident four years ago.

419
00:30:41,296 --> 00:30:42,695
God damn it.

420
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,243
We can do this.

421
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,611
We can get some wigs,
some sunglasses, and it's on.

422
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:02,343
Y'all gonna have to do this
without me.

423
00:31:03,618 --> 00:31:06,951
l keep thinking about Darnell
getting killed and Lorenz shot.

424
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:11,050
That's because Darnell and them
were a bunch of damn fools.

425
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:13,151
They don't know half
of what l know about banks.

426
00:31:14,195 --> 00:31:16,663
What if something goes wrong?
What if somebody gets hurt?

427
00:31:16,698 --> 00:31:19,565
Listen to me.
You're just scared, baby.

428
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,829
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.

429
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,929
That's why
this is the perfect crime.

430
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:25,371
l know this too well.

431
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:27,272
What about
all them folks' money?

432
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:30,436
-lnsurance.
-Dumb-ass comment.

433
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:33,743
Look, we're just taking
away from the system...

434
00:31:33,782 --> 00:31:36,580
that's fucking us all anyway.

435
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:38,609
You know?

436
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:42,854
Let's do it.

437
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:03,801
Excuse me.

438
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:38,706
How can l help you
today, Miss...?

439
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:41,680
Dorsey.

440
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:46,018
l'd like to open up
a new account.

441
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,688
Right this way.

442
00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:52,659
You can open up an interest-
bearing checking account...

443
00:32:52,694 --> 00:32:54,594
with a thousand dollar deposit,
if you like.

444
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:56,722
-lt's up to you.
-A thousand dollars?

445
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:01,698
Do you have long lines?

446
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:06,366
Not too bad. We usually operate
with about fourteen tellers.

447
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:12,310
Actually, l'm a manager
in corporate banking upstairs.

448
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:13,939
l don't know what
these folks do down here...

449
00:33:13,982 --> 00:33:15,973
but when l saw you,
l said to myself...

450
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:19,077
''Self, a woman that fine--''

451
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,055
As fine as you are,
and you are that fine--

452
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,786
''Needs to have
her own personal banker.''

453
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:26,521
So l couldn't help myself.

454
00:33:29,097 --> 00:33:31,292
She smiles. Come on, now.

455
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:36,126
Ms. Dorsey, l'm new in town...

456
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:38,071
and l swear to you,
l don't do this all the time.

457
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:39,903
l know you don't know me
from Adam.

458
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:43,138
l don't know
what your plans are tonight...

459
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:45,203
Do you have plans tonight?

460
00:33:45,246 --> 00:33:48,306
-Are you asking me out?
-Maybe.

461
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:54,615
Keith, well, l see
you're in new accounts now.

462
00:33:54,656 --> 00:33:57,124
Nigel, thank you. Thank you
for your observation there.

463
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:00,384
These people
are going to kill me.

464
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:02,328
Now, can l have your number?

465
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:12,705
But l'll take yours.

466
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:20,671
Well, what were you doing
in there?

467
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:22,239
l was just talking.

468
00:34:22,283 --> 00:34:24,410
But l thought we was here
to case the bank.

469
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:26,818
That's what l was doing.
He has an inside track.

470
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:29,516
He works here.
Plus he grabbed me.

471
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:31,923
Did he ask you out?

472
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,325
Maybe.

473
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:37,331
So you ain't gonna tell me, huh?

474
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:39,697
Well, maybe he could
put a smile on my face.

475
00:34:50,812 --> 00:34:54,009
Girl, Luther is gonna kill you
if he sees that baby.

476
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:56,642
-T.T., What happened?
-l had to bring him with me.

477
00:34:56,684 --> 00:35:00,017
Hey, wait. Whoa!
Don't put him there, please.

478
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:01,146
Put him over there.

479
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:46,866
Come on!

480
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:48,232
-Come on! Move it!
-lt's OK, ma'am.

481
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:50,760
We can't waste time!
Let's go! Let's go!

482
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:52,272
Open the elevator!

483
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:54,207
Open it up! Hurry up!

484
00:35:54,242 --> 00:35:55,402
lt's all right.

485
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:08,520
l think your son is going
to pull through just fine.

486
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:10,649
-Yes.
-Can l see him?

487
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:14,856
You need to speak with Ms. Wells
with Child Protective Services.

488
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:18,263
No. l know you ain't fixing
to take her son.

489
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:20,767
Wait, hold the fuck up.
That was an accident.

490
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:23,862
We was right there,
looking right at him.

491
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:25,304
lt wasn't two seconds--

492
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,740
l need to talk
to the mother alone.

493
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:40,083
Ms. Williams, the boy
has been severely poisoned.

494
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:41,554
l'm sure it was an accident...

495
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:43,784
but we're going to retain
custody just to be sure...

496
00:36:43,825 --> 00:36:46,123
the child isn't suffering
from neglect.

497
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,823
That's my son.
l would die for him.

498
00:36:49,864 --> 00:36:51,525
He was in an unsafe environment.

499
00:36:51,566 --> 00:36:53,659
He shouldn't have been
at the workplace with you.

500
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:55,669
l didn't have a choice.

501
00:36:55,703 --> 00:36:58,228
l don't have money
for a baby-sitter.

502
00:36:58,272 --> 00:37:00,672
You're going to have to prove
you can take care of him.

503
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:03,836
Kids get into poison every day.

504
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:07,678
Not in the workplace.
To us, that spells neglect.

505
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:10,013
Now, Jajuan will remain
in our custody...

506
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:12,076
until you can pay
for proper child care.

507
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,315
What if l can't
come up with the money?

508
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:17,956
Like l said,
you will get a court date.

509
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:20,756
At that time, the judge
will decide what will happen.

510
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:27,389
Please! You can't take my baby.

511
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:29,403
l'm going to die
without my baby.

512
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:31,632
Tisean, come on.

513
00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:32,969
l'm gonna die without my baby.

514
00:37:33,007 --> 00:37:34,736
T.T, we're going to handle this.

515
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:39,179
Fuck this shit.
You know what you got to do.

516
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:41,908
You know.

517
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:45,651
You in?

518
00:37:49,757 --> 00:37:51,588
Come on, T.T.

519
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:01,694
Cleo, take the note
to the merchant teller.

520
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:03,294
She will have
at least twenty grand.

521
00:38:03,337 --> 00:38:05,862
On Wednesdays,
Sears makes a big deposit...

522
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:08,239
so she could have
thirty-five thousand.

523
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:11,768
l give her the note and tell her
not to give me any bait money.

524
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:14,873
Tell her not to draw
from the right-hand clip.

525
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:17,680
lf she does,
she's setting off the alarm.

526
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:19,083
''Don't give me any bait money...

527
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,985
''and if you come out
of that right-hand clip...

528
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:22,489
''my gun goes in your mouth.''

529
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:24,991
That's what l'm talking about.

530
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:26,357
Let's go through plan ''B.''

531
00:38:26,394 --> 00:38:28,658
Plan ''B''?
Fuck this planning shit.

532
00:38:28,696 --> 00:38:31,062
Why can't we just kick butt
with these motherfuckers...

533
00:38:31,098 --> 00:38:32,759
and go up in there
and take all the fucking money?

534
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,065
Why can't you just listen
for once?

535
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:40,071
Plan ''B,'' Frankie.

536
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:42,701
Stony, when Cleo goes
to the merchant teller...

537
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:44,574
you start to survey the line
for the cow.

538
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:48,206
Cow? There's going to be a cow
up in there?

539
00:38:51,252 --> 00:38:53,413
Stop smoking weed.

540
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:57,082
Cleo, the cow
is just a small vault on wheels.

541
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:58,785
They push it
from window to window...

542
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:00,293
depending on
which teller needs cash.

543
00:39:01,062 --> 00:39:03,656
lf the cow is there,
it'll be open...

544
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:05,165
and we'll have
at least fifty thousand.

545
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:38,126
Look here,
let me talk to Black Sam.

546
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,567
Black Sam,
she want to talk to you.

547
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:53,643
Damn.

548
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:55,205
Shit.

549
00:40:00,955 --> 00:40:02,946
-So what you need?
-A favor.

550
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,653
Yeah, well, what else is new?

551
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:08,787
Come on, Black Sam.

552
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:10,490
After all them cars
l done stole for you?

553
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:13,557
We're going there, huh?
All right, check it out.

554
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:17,264
Y'all can roll
with that right there.

555
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:20,672
We ain't robbin' stagecoaches.

556
00:40:21,642 --> 00:40:23,269
l need something
l can set it off with.

557
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:24,972
Y'all ain't bullshitting?

558
00:40:25,012 --> 00:40:26,536
We want them guns
we were shooting.

559
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:29,982
You're tripping.
Y'all can't afford them guns.

560
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:31,450
That's why it's a favor.

561
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:35,219
l'll bring them back...
with interest.

562
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,951
With interest, huh?

563
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:41,693
Check this.

564
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,826
What's up with hooking me up
with your homegirl, Frankie?

565
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,666
lnterest. That's it, Sam.

566
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:52,900
lt's like that.

567
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,900
l'm going to let y'all
use my shit, right?

568
00:40:57,945 --> 00:41:00,175
But if y'all get caught--

569
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:02,546
l'm already knowing it. l know.

570
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:03,880
Yeah, all right.

571
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:05,579
l'm coming back
for that Uzi, too.

572
00:41:06,587 --> 00:41:09,385
Bruce, go on and hook them up.
The right shit.

573
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:10,685
All right.

574
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:34,507
Come on, baby.

575
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:39,082
What have we got here? Bullshit.

576
00:41:42,657 --> 00:41:44,147
Fucking bullshit.

577
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:49,456
Now, that's what l ride to.

578
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,560
OK, ready?

579
00:41:57,605 --> 00:41:58,765
Y'all OK?

580
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:02,441
OK, wait a minute.
Let's just wait.

581
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:07,170
OK, let's just wait.
Just for a second.

582
00:42:08,249 --> 00:42:09,841
What's wrong?

583
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:12,179
l can't do this.

584
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:18,719
Frankie, she's right, OK?
We didn't case this bank.

585
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:20,226
We cased Downtown Federal.

586
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:22,092
They're all pretty much
the same.

587
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:25,755
l ain't feeling this, Frankie.
This ain't right.

588
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:39,740
Everybody get down
on the ground right now!

589
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,247
Put your hands up!

590
00:42:41,282 --> 00:42:43,250
Everybody stay down!

591
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:48,755
Go! Go!

592
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:51,724
-All right!
-Turn around!

593
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:53,659
All of y'all,
turn the fuck around!

594
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:55,662
-Don't move!
-Move back! Move back!

595
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,260
Turn around, girl!
What the fuck you looking at?

596
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,858
Give me the money!
Pull out the drawer!

597
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:03,699
Put the phone down!
Put your arms up!

598
00:43:06,307 --> 00:43:07,501
You better lay down!

599
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:13,175
-Don't move!
-Y'all just be cool!

600
00:43:14,248 --> 00:43:17,217
Don't move! Don't move!
Stay there.

601
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:19,116
Fuckers...
what are you looking at?

602
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:21,314
l'm a bitch with a gun! Two!

603
00:43:21,355 --> 00:43:22,583
We're taking too much time!

604
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,125
-Come on!
-Here we go.

605
00:43:29,864 --> 00:43:31,923
Move it!
We're almost to the door.

606
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,430
Come on! Go, go!

607
00:43:58,392 --> 00:44:02,192
Now, that's how you work it.
That shit was brilliant!

608
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:04,390
Frankie, we robbed a bank!

609
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,801
Listen to me.
That is a lot of money.

610
00:44:09,837 --> 00:44:11,828
Are we going
to get away with this?

611
00:44:11,872 --> 00:44:14,807
What do you mean?
What does this look like?

612
00:44:16,277 --> 00:44:17,437
ls it ours?

613
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:22,472
Shit!

614
00:44:22,516 --> 00:44:24,609
Did you lock that door?

615
00:44:29,156 --> 00:44:32,421
-Where have you been?
-l caught the bus.

616
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:37,060
We weren't ready.
You know we weren't ready.

617
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:39,531
Look, if l didn't set it off,
we'd be casing banks...

618
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:41,933
for the next two months.
l had to push off!

619
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:49,599
lt worked, didn't it?

620
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:53,238
Look, Tisean, it's over.
We got about...

621
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:57,841
-What?
-About twelve Gs.

622
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:01,545
Twelve thousand dollars
in sixty seconds.

623
00:45:02,656 --> 00:45:07,252
Why don't you come over here
and sit down beside me?

624
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:09,421
OK? Come on.

625
00:45:18,439 --> 00:45:19,929
Sit!

626
00:45:24,979 --> 00:45:27,209
The vehicle stolen
from here today was lDed...

627
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:29,580
as the getaway car
in that South L.A. bank job.

628
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:33,915
l want to run prints
on all these.

629
00:45:33,954 --> 00:45:35,717
See if anybody shows up.

630
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:37,621
All right. Dust everything.

631
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:46,856
Moi. And...T.T.

632
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:50,670
T.T.? She ain't getting a cut.

633
00:45:50,704 --> 00:45:53,468
Look, Frankie,
l ain't for your shit tonight.

634
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:57,274
T.T. needs it
more than any of us.

635
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:59,370
She didn't do anything.
She walked out.

636
00:45:59,413 --> 00:46:02,314
Who the fuck cares?
She was there.

637
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:05,648
No! She didn't do nothing,
so she ain't getting nothing.

638
00:46:05,686 --> 00:46:07,210
Forget it.

639
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:08,915
Frankie,
l don't want your money.

640
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:13,620
lf you want to kick my ass,
let's get it over with...

641
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:15,458
because l am sick of your shit.

642
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:20,267
l need that money.

643
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:24,360
lt ain't you l'm mad at.

644
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,941
Damn. l'm sorry. l was tripping.

645
00:46:32,313 --> 00:46:33,712
You're my girl.

646
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:40,277
l need this.

647
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:43,586
You are so special, Frankie.

648
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:54,266
Still ain't do shit.

649
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:04,643
Waller, anything ever come up
on that Francesca Sutton girl?

650
00:47:04,678 --> 00:47:06,509
The bank teller suspected...

651
00:47:06,547 --> 00:47:08,378
of being in collusion
in the Pan-Pacific robbery?

652
00:47:08,415 --> 00:47:10,007
Nothing. Clean as a whistle.

653
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:14,278
OK, run this again for me.

654
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:38,268
-Come in for a drink?
-No, thank you.

655
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:39,973
-You sure?
-Yeah.

656
00:47:41,215 --> 00:47:42,842
All right. Let me get my jacket.

657
00:47:44,084 --> 00:47:46,177
l could have come
and picked you up.

658
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,188
No. l needed the exercise,
thanks.

659
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:51,157
-You look great.
-Thanks.

660
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,721
-What?
-Nothing.

661
00:47:55,763 --> 00:48:00,530
l've just never been out
with a guy like you before.

662
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:03,195
A guy like me.
What does that mean?

663
00:48:03,237 --> 00:48:07,503
l see. You must be used
to those roughneck types.

664
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,906
Where are we going to eat?

665
00:48:08,942 --> 00:48:13,276
Maybe you could show me
someplace in your hood.

666
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:15,907
-ln my hood?
-ln your hood.

667
00:48:15,949 --> 00:48:17,678
No, you ain't trying to flow
like that.

668
00:48:17,718 --> 00:48:19,447
l might be trying to flow
like that.

669
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:21,954
You're probably
from Harvard and all.

670
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:25,015
As a matter of fact, l am.
l still got to eat.

671
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:28,654
l'm still very hungry,
so could we please feed a man...

672
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:31,688
give him some nourishment
or some sustenance?

673
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:33,199
That's all l'm asking...

674
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:35,428
Miss You-need-to-starve-
because-you're-from-Harvard.

675
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:40,206
This is really
a nice restaurant.

676
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,767
lt's black-owned. l like that.
Do you come here often?

677
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:47,178
No. l've never been.
l just heard about it.

678
00:48:48,282 --> 00:48:49,408
So where are you from?

679
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,384
D.C. Have you ever been?

680
00:48:51,418 --> 00:48:53,443
Nope.

681
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:56,888
No, but that's where the mayor
got popped basing up, isn't it?

682
00:48:57,925 --> 00:49:01,053
Nobody's perfect, right?

683
00:49:01,095 --> 00:49:04,223
lt's a great town, though.
l really miss it.

684
00:49:04,264 --> 00:49:06,664
Anyway, l came directly
from New York.

685
00:49:08,102 --> 00:49:09,262
You ever been to New York?

686
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:15,140
Have you ever been
outside Los Angeles?

687
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,172
When l was in New York,
l was working on Wall Street...

688
00:49:21,215 --> 00:49:23,683
and before that, ''B'' School--

689
00:49:23,717 --> 00:49:24,809
Business school. l'm sorry.

690
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:27,184
l wanted to go
to business school.

691
00:49:27,221 --> 00:49:30,850
Really? Financing? Marketing?

692
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:33,018
No. Typing and bookkeeping.

693
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,825
l'm sorry.
ls that not professional enough?

694
00:49:39,867 --> 00:49:41,801
lt's just hard for me to believe
that you're this hard...

695
00:49:41,835 --> 00:49:43,598
when you're so beautiful.

696
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:47,267
And so tough.

697
00:49:47,307 --> 00:49:50,367
Not tough. l don't think
we have anything in common.

698
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,210
l don't want anything from you.
l really don't.

699
00:49:54,248 --> 00:49:56,716
l have no expectations,
no demands.

700
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,718
l am quite content...

701
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:01,714
just listening to you...

702
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:03,313
sitting here...

703
00:50:04,424 --> 00:50:08,417
staring into those beautiful,
pretty brown eyes.

704
00:50:10,264 --> 00:50:11,629
Are you cross-eyed?

705
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:15,428
No. Your head is just small.

706
00:50:17,404 --> 00:50:18,871
My head is small.

707
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:21,670
Makes my eyes go this way...

708
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:24,905
because l have to focus in
on your little peanut.

709
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:26,105
No, l'm just kidding.

710
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:36,950
This is it.

711
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,390
lt's not much, but it's home.

712
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:42,160
l took the lease
over from my brother...

713
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:43,493
who brought me to L.A.

714
00:50:44,932 --> 00:50:46,456
Do you feel free?

715
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,058
Hell, yeah, l feel free.

716
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:54,267
Well, l don't feel free.

717
00:50:54,308 --> 00:50:56,776
l feel very much caged.

718
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:00,712
Caged?
What are you doing about it?

719
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:02,305
What do you mean?

720
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:04,146
What are you doing
to get out of it?

721
00:51:04,184 --> 00:51:05,651
What are your plans?

722
00:51:05,686 --> 00:51:08,621
Where do you see yourself
in five years, Stony?

723
00:51:10,257 --> 00:51:11,656
l don't know.

724
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:15,927
That's what l'm saying.

725
00:51:15,963 --> 00:51:20,525
We don't plan for the future,
as a people.

726
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:21,693
Have you ever thought about it?

727
00:51:21,735 --> 00:51:24,966
Just put some serious thought
into seeing your future?

728
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,935
Well, l worked
really hard to keep...

729
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:30,307
a roof over
me and my brother's head...

730
00:51:30,344 --> 00:51:32,278
to keep clothes on our back...

731
00:51:34,314 --> 00:51:37,374
And l planned on
sending him to college.

732
00:51:37,417 --> 00:51:39,078
That's great.
Then he should go to college.

733
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,246
He'll go on and accomplish
tremendous things...

734
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:43,722
and be great and wonderful,
like his sister.

735
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:45,224
He's dead.

736
00:51:49,363 --> 00:51:51,627
l'm sorry. l didn't realize.

737
00:51:51,665 --> 00:51:54,225
-lt's OK.
-No, it's not.

738
00:51:56,803 --> 00:51:58,737
l'm dealing with it.

739
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:00,631
You are, aren't you?

740
00:52:04,244 --> 00:52:06,712
ls that a cabernet or a merlot?

741
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:08,442
Damn.

742
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,214
-Take care of it.
-All right.

743
00:52:31,805 --> 00:52:34,433
Captain Fredricks, sir?

744
00:52:34,474 --> 00:52:35,964
Do you remember
the Pan-Pacific bank robbery...

745
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:38,739
where four people were killed
and the subsequent arrest...

746
00:52:38,779 --> 00:52:40,246
where a young man
was shot and killed?

747
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,305
We're still getting
bad press with that.

748
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:44,544
l'd like to bring in
his sister Lita Newsome.

749
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:45,710
l think
she's one of the bank robbers.

750
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:46,878
What you got?

751
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,649
Right now l've got a girl
named Francesca Sutton.

752
00:52:48,689 --> 00:52:50,680
She's a teller
at the Pan-Pacific bank...

753
00:52:50,724 --> 00:52:53,249
and l'm relatively certain
she was connected.

754
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:54,624
Go on.

755
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:57,255
Francesca Sutton and
Lita Newsome are best friends.

756
00:52:57,297 --> 00:52:59,765
Right,
that's a big coincidence...

757
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,200
but there's also
a physical likeness--

758
00:53:02,235 --> 00:53:04,294
Do you remember the headline?

759
00:53:05,272 --> 00:53:07,206
''lnnocent student
killed by cops.''

760
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,901
Now you want
to bring in his sister...

761
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:11,035
based on the fact
that she knows someone...

762
00:53:11,078 --> 00:53:12,238
who may be friends
with a bank robber?

763
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:13,405
You're goddamn right--

764
00:53:13,447 --> 00:53:16,439
What the hell's wrong
with you, Strode? No way!

765
00:53:16,483 --> 00:53:18,348
Can l get a tail on her, sir?

766
00:53:18,385 --> 00:53:20,853
What part of ''no''
don't you understand, Strode?

767
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:22,411
The ''N'' or the ''O''?

768
00:53:39,906 --> 00:53:41,703
Oh, shit, now.

769
00:53:41,742 --> 00:53:42,902
Watch it!

770
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,675
Fuck them niggers. Yeah!

771
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:55,052
Watch it, honey.
Here it come now.

772
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:24,645
Yeah, now.

773
00:54:24,684 --> 00:54:27,710
Shit, girl. What is you--

774
00:54:27,754 --> 00:54:31,246
Cleo, how come you ain't been
to work in a week?

775
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,486
'Cause look what l got here.

776
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:36,328
l bought my baby
some new things.

777
00:54:36,363 --> 00:54:37,853
Check them out.

778
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:40,393
Luther said you're fired.

779
00:54:44,104 --> 00:54:46,834
We got to act
like nothing's different.

780
00:54:46,873 --> 00:54:49,740
You need to get to Luther's
and get your job back.

781
00:54:49,776 --> 00:54:51,971
Man, Luther can kiss
my ashy kneecap.

782
00:54:52,012 --> 00:54:54,207
This money got you tripping.

783
00:54:55,449 --> 00:54:57,747
l know you out of money
by now, Cleo.

784
00:54:57,784 --> 00:54:59,979
Now what you going to do?

785
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,080
Rob another goddamn bank.
What the fuck is y'all thinking?

786
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:05,455
Hold up. We said once, Cleo...

787
00:55:05,492 --> 00:55:07,517
to get us enough change
to get out of here!

788
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:12,294
That's all it is, Stony.
We need some real money.

789
00:55:12,332 --> 00:55:14,527
l don't know how far out of town
you plan to get, baby sister...

790
00:55:14,568 --> 00:55:17,196
but you ain't
getting far on three grand.

791
00:55:17,237 --> 00:55:18,397
Really?

792
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,867
All right, Louise,
you take Thelma over there...

793
00:55:21,908 --> 00:55:25,105
and y'all go rob another bank
if you all that.

794
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:29,141
Fuck you.

795
00:55:30,484 --> 00:55:33,544
l know you ain't fin to back
down on us now we need you.

796
00:55:35,188 --> 00:55:37,383
l want some more
motherfucking money.

797
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,228
You are real high...

798
00:55:42,262 --> 00:55:45,254
and you acting real stupid.

799
00:55:46,766 --> 00:55:49,257
You need to get
that gun out my face.

800
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:54,264
Shit!

801
00:55:54,307 --> 00:55:57,242
Don't you ever fucking
raise a gun to me again!

802
00:55:57,277 --> 00:55:59,074
Or what?

803
00:55:59,112 --> 00:56:00,340
What!

804
00:56:01,448 --> 00:56:03,313
Are you going to hit me,
motherfucker?

805
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:06,675
Stony,
we go back to first grade!

806
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,188
You been my peeps
for twenty years!

807
00:56:09,222 --> 00:56:10,712
Get off of me!

808
00:56:13,426 --> 00:56:15,087
You know what? l ain't
fucking with you no more.

809
00:56:17,063 --> 00:56:19,293
Yeah, well, fuck you, too!

810
00:56:23,169 --> 00:56:24,329
Fuck her!

811
00:56:30,243 --> 00:56:32,711
Ay, qu linda! Come on in.

812
00:56:32,746 --> 00:56:34,213
How you doing?

813
00:56:34,247 --> 00:56:35,714
l'm all right.

814
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:39,583
You sure? All right.
Hope you like Mexican food.

815
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:42,213
We have fajitas, enchiladas,
special sauce.

816
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:44,223
Have a seat right there.

817
00:56:44,257 --> 00:56:46,225
You say you don't travel a lot.

818
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:47,556
This is what
we're going to do, Stony.

819
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:52,661
From here on out, l cook.
We eat.

820
00:56:52,699 --> 00:56:55,725
You pick the country,
starting with Mexico.

821
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:59,102
Now, sit back. Relax.

822
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:00,663
Take a load off your feet.

823
00:57:00,707 --> 00:57:04,973
Smell the aroma of Mexico
and the sounds...

824
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:08,703
What?

825
00:57:10,717 --> 00:57:13,379
l just got a lot on my mind.

826
00:57:15,589 --> 00:57:16,749
You want to talk about it?

827
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:30,102
What do you think about
friends and money?

828
00:57:31,738 --> 00:57:33,330
l think they don't mix. Why?

829
00:57:33,373 --> 00:57:36,433
l just had
a very big argument...

830
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:40,037
with one of my best friends
about a money situation...

831
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:43,641
and l don't think
we're gonna be friends anymore.

832
00:57:45,251 --> 00:57:47,719
Don't you lose that friend
over money.

833
00:57:47,754 --> 00:57:49,244
lt's not worth it.

834
00:57:50,757 --> 00:57:54,659
The money you can replace easy.

835
00:57:55,862 --> 00:57:59,229
Friends--
real friends...you can't.

836
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,890
Don't sweat it.

837
00:58:03,203 --> 00:58:06,172
You have the answer
to everything, don't you?

838
00:58:06,206 --> 00:58:08,174
No, l wouldn't say that.

839
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:10,176
l'm just sharing
my experience with you.

840
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,508
Who do you think you are?

841
00:58:13,713 --> 00:58:15,772
l'll be your genie
if you let me.

842
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,745
Your every wish is my command.

843
00:58:31,665 --> 00:58:34,862
Cleo, you know you was wrong
for what you did to Stony.

844
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:38,359
Fuck her! Fuck Stony!
We'll do this without her.

845
00:58:38,405 --> 00:58:41,704
Wait a minute. Let's suppose
Stony put a gun in your face.

846
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:44,938
What would you do?
l would have slapped you, too.

847
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:47,970
Come on, now.
l wasn't gonna shoot her.

848
00:58:49,382 --> 00:58:51,213
You know how l get
when l'm faded.

849
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:52,741
You still was wrong.

850
00:58:55,622 --> 00:58:59,023
T.T., what's my girl gonna do?

851
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:00,219
l know you got to step
to that judge...

852
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,728
and prove you got some coins
in the bank.

853
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:05,230
l ain't doing nothing
without Stony.

854
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:12,599
l don't want to give
that ho no ride.

855
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:14,402
Why don't you
stop acting like a baby?

856
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:39,859
Bingo.

857
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:43,029
Come to me, baby. Oh, yeah.

858
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:45,503
Grin in that photo.
You love to see it.

859
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:50,006
Hey, Waller.

860
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:52,611
Tell me something...

861
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:58,277
did l or did l not say
all these women run together?

862
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:04,317
Do you feel me?
l thought that you would.

863
01:00:04,357 --> 01:00:05,915
Work with me, baby.

864
01:00:11,664 --> 01:00:13,632
Look, l'm sorry.

865
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:15,827
You're sorry.

866
01:00:16,936 --> 01:00:18,665
Let's just put it all behind us.

867
01:00:20,673 --> 01:00:24,666
Come on. We been through worse.

868
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:28,170
Apology accepted.

869
01:00:30,116 --> 01:00:32,482
But you know you need
to come back in with us.

870
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:34,953
You ain't got enough money
to get out of town.

871
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:38,384
You're right about that.

872
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:41,557
But l want more than that.

873
01:00:42,862 --> 01:00:44,659
l mean, is this the only way?

874
01:00:44,697 --> 01:00:47,495
See, 'cause
l want to be somebody...

875
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:50,128
who doesn't have to do this,
you know what l'm saying?

876
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:55,799
Stony, you can go to suburbia
and start a new life...

877
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:58,937
but we ain't nothing
but hood rats.

878
01:01:00,547 --> 01:01:03,072
Now, l can live with that.
You can't.

879
01:01:04,651 --> 01:01:07,142
The hood is where l belong.

880
01:01:09,923 --> 01:01:12,118
l mean, what am l
going to do in Hollywood...

881
01:01:12,158 --> 01:01:14,422
or Thousand Oaks or some shit?

882
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:17,626
Man, shit.

883
01:01:17,664 --> 01:01:20,189
Why do we got to roll over
and accept that, though?

884
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:23,562
We got to have a plan.

885
01:01:24,904 --> 01:01:26,667
What does our future look like?

886
01:01:28,174 --> 01:01:31,166
Where do you see yourself
five years from now?

887
01:01:35,081 --> 01:01:36,241
l don't know...

888
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,110
and l don't care.

889
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:41,687
And l ain't thinking
about five years from now.

890
01:01:43,556 --> 01:01:45,649
l'm just trying
to get through today.

891
01:01:45,692 --> 01:01:47,182
What the hell?

892
01:01:48,695 --> 01:01:52,256
Cleo, l know you didn't come
to work.

893
01:01:52,298 --> 01:01:55,267
Ain't been to work
and don't call nobody.

894
01:01:56,703 --> 01:01:59,194
l'm broke, Luther.

895
01:01:59,239 --> 01:02:00,672
l know you gonna give me
my old job back...

896
01:02:00,707 --> 01:02:03,938
'cause don't nobody take shit
the way l take shit.

897
01:02:03,977 --> 01:02:06,969
Shut up before l stick that mop
up your ass, Luther.

898
01:02:07,013 --> 01:02:10,278
You better save that
for your little girlfriend.

899
01:02:11,517 --> 01:02:14,816
Well? Get to work!

900
01:02:14,854 --> 01:02:18,551
Ladies...and gentlemen!

901
01:02:24,264 --> 01:02:26,630
There's been a rift
in this family...

902
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:29,134
and that is not
good for business.

903
01:02:29,168 --> 01:02:32,194
We want a plan like it was.
Back to work, see?

904
01:02:33,406 --> 01:02:37,638
lf only Tisean and Stony
will come rob the bank with us.

905
01:02:37,677 --> 01:02:39,872
We started as a gang of four.

906
01:02:39,913 --> 01:02:42,074
We must always be four.

907
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:47,950
Don Stony from the Bronx,
what is your opinion?

908
01:02:47,987 --> 01:02:50,182
Should we rob the bank?

909
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:59,689
Only way l can return
to this family.

910
01:03:01,467 --> 01:03:07,030
lf we do this one more time,
we do it right.

911
01:03:08,942 --> 01:03:11,376
Get enough money to get us
up out of here for good.

912
01:03:13,613 --> 01:03:16,013
T.T., you agree?

913
01:03:20,353 --> 01:03:25,086
Cleomenza, no more
funny-looking underwear...

914
01:03:25,124 --> 01:03:26,785
for your little girlfriend.

915
01:03:26,826 --> 01:03:27,952
Cleomenza...

916
01:03:27,994 --> 01:03:32,090
no more...fancy cars.

917
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:38,133
The shopping sprees...

918
01:03:39,906 --> 01:03:44,468
Cleomenza, can you respect
our conditions?

919
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:48,708
Can you live with the terms
that your dons have set forth?

920
01:03:53,152 --> 01:03:54,915
Yes, Godfather.

921
01:03:55,855 --> 01:03:58,688
Tisean Scalina from Detroit...

922
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:00,556
are you cool with all of this?

923
01:04:02,996 --> 01:04:06,727
And you,
Don Stony from the Bronx...

924
01:04:07,967 --> 01:04:10,265
can you accept
your godfather's terms?

925
01:04:15,641 --> 01:04:18,576
All right, then.
We back in effect.

926
01:04:18,611 --> 01:04:21,011
Next stop is
Balboa Savings & Loan.

927
01:04:24,117 --> 01:04:26,108
Think you can do that?

928
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:29,611
Hurry up.

929
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:40,622
You got it?

930
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:48,107
Come on, Cleo.
What are you doing?

931
01:04:48,141 --> 01:04:52,237
-Pass me a tape.
-No. Let's go.

932
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:54,940
l ain't going nowhere
till you pass me a tape.

933
01:04:58,151 --> 01:05:00,585
Take that shit and let's go.

934
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,569
-Help me out.
-Please don't.

935
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:19,571
Come on.
l've been out here all night.

936
01:05:19,605 --> 01:05:21,072
l'm sorry.

937
01:05:21,107 --> 01:05:23,075
Come on. Just a couple
of bucks or something.

938
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:26,567
l'm sorry, ma'am.
Sir, please, will you stop?

939
01:05:26,612 --> 01:05:28,580
You're annoying
our customers out here.

940
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,674
l'm not hurting anybody.
Come on, man.

941
01:05:31,717 --> 01:05:35,585
l want you to move down
and leave our people alone.

942
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:37,589
Now, l've been asked
to come out here--

943
01:05:37,623 --> 01:05:40,091
Come on, man.
l'm not hurting anybody.

944
01:05:40,126 --> 01:05:42,253
-You're drunk.
-No, l'm not.

945
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:52,503
Everybody get the fuck down
right now!

946
01:05:52,538 --> 01:05:54,096
Move it! You, down!

947
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:57,200
Hands over your head!
Back away from the drawers!

948
01:05:57,243 --> 01:05:59,370
That's right, you!
Move back! Get down!

949
01:05:59,412 --> 01:06:01,710
Open that drawer!
Fill it up! Let's go!

950
01:06:01,747 --> 01:06:04,682
Did you hear what l said? Down!

951
01:06:04,717 --> 01:06:07,345
Back up! Back up!

952
01:06:07,386 --> 01:06:08,944
You, up! Let's go!

953
01:06:08,988 --> 01:06:12,287
Oh, please!
Oh, please, mama!

954
01:06:12,325 --> 01:06:14,316
Bitch,
would you shut the fuck up?

955
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,591
Nobody move!

956
01:06:18,965 --> 01:06:22,025
-What's going on here?
-We're having difficulties--

957
01:06:22,068 --> 01:06:24,059
l'm not bothering anybody.

958
01:06:24,103 --> 01:06:25,570
Come on.

959
01:06:25,605 --> 01:06:26,970
What's happening?

960
01:06:27,006 --> 01:06:29,406
A minute and a half! Come on!

961
01:06:29,442 --> 01:06:31,467
Just get your money.
Don't be a hero. Let's go!

962
01:06:35,114 --> 01:06:36,706
You! Open up the cow!

963
01:06:37,783 --> 01:06:40,081
We need backup over here.

964
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:42,417
We got a vagrant
that's drunk and disorderly.

965
01:06:42,455 --> 01:06:44,616
Would you send
another unit, please?

966
01:06:44,657 --> 01:06:46,818
Come on! Let's make it!

967
01:06:46,859 --> 01:06:47,951
Move it!

968
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:50,758
-Let's make it! Come on!
-Cover me!

969
01:06:52,598 --> 01:06:54,566
Don't make me
get ugly up in here...

970
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,660
ladies and gentlemen...
not today.

971
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:02,540
Hey, you! Keep your hands down!

972
01:07:02,575 --> 01:07:05,408
Everybody face down!
Face down!

973
01:07:05,444 --> 01:07:07,378
Let's go! Let's go!

974
01:07:07,413 --> 01:07:08,971
Keep him in line, girl.

975
01:07:10,716 --> 01:07:14,482
-Down!
-Hey! Come on, let's make it!

976
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:00,121
Hey! Don't.

977
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:02,191
Do not.

978
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:04,100
Where's Cleo?

979
01:08:21,287 --> 01:08:23,118
Come on! Let's go!

980
01:08:26,659 --> 01:08:29,093
Let's go, God damn it!

981
01:08:29,128 --> 01:08:31,221
You are crazy, Cleo.

982
01:08:40,306 --> 01:08:42,274
Holy shit!

983
01:08:43,409 --> 01:08:45,172
Move! Move!

984
01:08:46,145 --> 01:08:48,340
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

985
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,971
Yeah! We dig that shit!

986
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:33,256
The way you busted
through that wall!

987
01:09:35,094 --> 01:09:37,062
We did it!

988
01:09:37,096 --> 01:09:39,587
l thought it was over,
with the cops right outside!

989
01:09:39,632 --> 01:09:40,826
Where was you going?

990
01:09:40,866 --> 01:09:43,232
l was coming
to get y'all's asses!

991
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:45,066
What about T.T.?

992
01:09:45,104 --> 01:09:47,766
The way she got the drop
on the cop!

993
01:09:47,807 --> 01:09:50,207
lf you think of anything else,
give us a call today.

994
01:09:57,116 --> 01:10:00,574
-Where's the girls?
-Took off in the Suburban.

995
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:03,816
The getaway car was blocked.
They're still out there.

996
01:10:03,856 --> 01:10:07,087
Car theft reports from
near the 21st Street garage.

997
01:10:07,126 --> 01:10:08,388
Getting in way over their heads,
aren't they?

998
01:10:10,563 --> 01:10:11,791
They don't fucking know it.

999
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:15,062
Man, counting money is
harder than working for Luther.

1000
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:16,591
l'm getting dizzy up here!

1001
01:10:21,607 --> 01:10:27,568
Two hundred and ninety-six
thousand and counting!

1002
01:10:27,613 --> 01:10:31,709
-What's that?
-seventy-five thousand apiece.

1003
01:10:33,252 --> 01:10:37,450
Seventy-five thousand apiece.
That's a lot of money.

1004
01:10:38,624 --> 01:10:40,251
l'm rich!

1005
01:10:43,295 --> 01:10:44,853
Look at all of this.

1006
01:10:44,897 --> 01:10:46,592
Look, this is
what we're going to do.

1007
01:10:46,632 --> 01:10:48,429
We're going to keep
scrubbing floors for Luther...

1008
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:50,230
like we've been doing.
Nothing's changed.

1009
01:10:50,269 --> 01:10:53,466
We get Jajuan, and in
three days, we are out of here!

1010
01:10:53,506 --> 01:10:54,939
l'm going to miss you all.

1011
01:10:56,675 --> 01:10:59,041
Well, what happened?
What did she do?

1012
01:10:59,078 --> 01:11:01,103
Girl, you know
you coming with us.

1013
01:11:01,147 --> 01:11:04,139
l got money!

1014
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,546
You run the CDs
from the parking garage?

1015
01:11:08,587 --> 01:11:10,054
Yeah. They're clean.

1016
01:11:10,089 --> 01:11:13,058
Give these a try.
lt's all connected.

1017
01:11:13,092 --> 01:11:15,083
All right.
We'll get these dusted now.

1018
01:11:43,823 --> 01:11:47,088
How come we're putting the money
in here instead of at home?

1019
01:11:47,126 --> 01:11:50,459
lf the police track us down,
that's the first place to look.

1020
01:11:54,633 --> 01:11:56,624
All right.

1021
01:12:00,439 --> 01:12:02,999
Stony, listen. l'm substituting
for my boss tonight...

1022
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:05,533
at a party for the National
Association of Bankers...

1023
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:08,479
at the Biltmore,
and l'd like for you to come--

1024
01:12:10,749 --> 01:12:12,546
Damn it.

1025
01:12:14,587 --> 01:12:16,384
That would be really nice.

1026
01:12:16,422 --> 01:12:18,890
Great. Listen,
be here early, like 6:00...

1027
01:12:18,924 --> 01:12:20,516
because l don't know
what time the limo's coming...

1028
01:12:20,559 --> 01:12:21,992
since you won't let me
pick you up.

1029
01:12:22,027 --> 01:12:23,289
Limo?

1030
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:26,059
Black tie. Limo. 6:00.

1031
01:12:26,098 --> 01:12:27,895
l'll see you then.

1032
01:12:34,106 --> 01:12:36,574
Y'all are real rude.

1033
01:12:36,609 --> 01:12:39,009
l know you heard me
on the phone.

1034
01:12:48,621 --> 01:12:50,179
Do you like it?

1035
01:12:51,957 --> 01:12:54,084
Yeah. You look great.

1036
01:12:54,126 --> 01:12:56,754
No, you don't.

1037
01:12:56,795 --> 01:12:59,127
No. lt's colorful.

1038
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,061
We're late. l'll be right back.

1039
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:08,062
l told Frankie l look
like a box of crayons.

1040
01:13:14,847 --> 01:13:16,872
So, you like?

1041
01:13:16,916 --> 01:13:20,408
lt's real nice.
You got a bar. You got crystal.

1042
01:13:20,452 --> 01:13:23,546
We've been spending
a lot of time together lately...

1043
01:13:23,589 --> 01:13:25,056
and it's been nice.

1044
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:28,423
We've been real straightforward
with one another, honest...

1045
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:31,088
but l have lied about one thing.

1046
01:13:32,598 --> 01:13:35,089
What have you lied about?

1047
01:13:36,602 --> 01:13:38,069
Let's take a little detour.

1048
01:13:38,103 --> 01:13:41,038
Alex, do me a favor.
Change of plans.

1049
01:13:41,073 --> 01:13:44,065
Take a right at the next light,
and l'll tell you from there.

1050
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,023
Should we go?

1051
01:14:40,532 --> 01:14:43,933
You're doing great, baby.
Enjoy yourself tonight.

1052
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:47,769
-Champagne?
-Yes. Thank you.

1053
01:14:52,611 --> 01:14:53,839
Are you nervous?

1054
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:57,844
-Don't be.
-OK.

1055
01:14:57,883 --> 01:15:00,511
You are the most
beautiful lady in the room.

1056
01:15:00,552 --> 01:15:03,521
Don't you ever forget that.

1057
01:15:03,555 --> 01:15:05,022
Hey, Nigel.
How you doing, buddy?

1058
01:15:05,057 --> 01:15:08,026
-How you doing?
-Patrice.

1059
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,029
Thank God you're here.
l was getting tired...

1060
01:15:11,063 --> 01:15:13,463
of making clever banter
with Ross Milner.

1061
01:15:13,499 --> 01:15:16,024
-Hello. l'm Nigel.
-Hi.

1062
01:15:16,068 --> 01:15:19,526
You're Miss New Account.
Your follow-up is impressive.

1063
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:23,029
l taught Keith everything
about corporate banking.

1064
01:15:23,075 --> 01:15:24,940
l'd like you to meet my--

1065
01:15:24,977 --> 01:15:26,535
Lady.

1066
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:34,541
There are some heavy hitters
here--Muchigawa from Sonawa.

1067
01:15:34,586 --> 01:15:36,554
Yeah. l saw Storum
from Citibank over there.

1068
01:15:36,588 --> 01:15:40,217
Check this out--if a terrorist
blew this place up...

1069
01:15:40,259 --> 01:15:42,557
the banking systems
of Japan, Europe...

1070
01:15:42,594 --> 01:15:44,562
and the United States
would never recover.

1071
01:15:44,596 --> 01:15:46,564
l thought that a room
full of dead bankers...

1072
01:15:46,598 --> 01:15:49,123
meant that the world
would be a better place.

1073
01:15:50,569 --> 01:15:52,366
My wife.

1074
01:15:52,404 --> 01:15:56,067
So, Stony,
are you in banking also?

1075
01:15:56,108 --> 01:15:59,077
Yes...in a way.

1076
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:02,478
Wells Fargo, B. of A., Chemical?

1077
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:05,005
l prefer to create
my own personalized portfolio...

1078
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:09,510
reflecting an original, diverse
taste in funding sources.

1079
01:16:09,555 --> 01:16:10,715
Well.

1080
01:16:12,558 --> 01:16:16,016
Always got me in trouble.
Always raiding sororities.

1081
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:19,519
So he hasn't grown up yet,
but we're working on him.

1082
01:16:19,565 --> 01:16:22,056
Right. He seems like a nice guy.

1083
01:16:22,101 --> 01:16:25,036
No. He's terrible. l hate him.

1084
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:26,537
He's a good guy.

1085
01:16:26,572 --> 01:16:27,834
l want you to know...

1086
01:16:29,074 --> 01:16:31,599
this is one of
the best nights of my life.

1087
01:16:32,911 --> 01:16:35,311
l've never felt so special.

1088
01:16:35,347 --> 01:16:37,713
Do you feel free now?

1089
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,550
Well, for now,
but it's not my life.

1090
01:16:41,587 --> 01:16:43,555
l've just borrowed
from pieces of yours.

1091
01:16:43,589 --> 01:16:47,855
Borrowing's not a bad thing,
as long as you return the favor.

1092
01:16:51,597 --> 01:16:55,727
Look at all your friends.
They all own banks.

1093
01:16:55,768 --> 01:16:58,601
Where l'm from, you're lucky
to have a bank account.

1094
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:04,202
l just want to get out of here.

1095
01:17:04,243 --> 01:17:06,268
Have you ever felt like that...

1096
01:17:06,311 --> 01:17:08,074
like you just wanted
to get up and go...

1097
01:17:08,113 --> 01:17:10,081
and move forward and you can't?

1098
01:17:10,115 --> 01:17:11,980
Baby, you don't
have to go anywhere.

1099
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:16,020
Stay with me
for a little while...

1100
01:17:16,054 --> 01:17:19,581
and then you decide
if you want to stick around.

1101
01:17:21,527 --> 01:17:23,552
You think about it.

1102
01:17:26,565 --> 01:17:28,499
With your fine self.

1103
01:19:19,044 --> 01:19:20,534
You crazy.

1104
01:19:23,548 --> 01:19:26,517
Hi. l'm Pete Rodney.
l'm taking over for Luther.

1105
01:19:26,551 --> 01:19:28,018
Where's Luther?

1106
01:19:28,053 --> 01:19:30,021
He ain't cleaning
this building no more.

1107
01:19:30,055 --> 01:19:31,545
He got out of the business.

1108
01:19:32,891 --> 01:19:34,017
l'm going to--

1109
01:19:34,059 --> 01:19:36,550
-Hi.
-How you doing?

1110
01:19:43,268 --> 01:19:46,066
This motherfucker
better not touch that money.

1111
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:49,067
Rip it!

1112
01:19:51,576 --> 01:19:55,034
-Come on. Come on.
-lt's gone.

1113
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,072
l'm going to kill
this motherfucker! Come on.

1114
01:20:09,594 --> 01:20:12,062
Yo, Sam. You got company.

1115
01:20:12,097 --> 01:20:14,065
Hey, Sam, you seen Luther?

1116
01:20:16,001 --> 01:20:18,128
Luther came by here earlier.

1117
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:19,569
Looked like he came
upon some dollars.

1118
01:20:19,604 --> 01:20:23,563
Had this shit all permed up.
What's up?

1119
01:20:23,608 --> 01:20:27,305
We got twisted, man--
our money and your interest.

1120
01:20:30,615 --> 01:20:33,584
That's why
that fool was acting crazy.

1121
01:20:33,618 --> 01:20:37,076
See, now you're fucking
with my money, though.

1122
01:20:37,122 --> 01:20:40,091
But l know where he at.

1123
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:43,094
He at a hotel
over there on 55th...

1124
01:20:43,128 --> 01:20:45,096
55th and Ninth.

1125
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:46,620
Thanks.

1126
01:20:51,636 --> 01:20:54,730
Got a little something
for that ass, baby.

1127
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,000
Climb out the pussy
for a minute, Luther.

1128
01:21:26,872 --> 01:21:28,635
Find it!

1129
01:21:28,673 --> 01:21:30,698
Look all around this room.
Tear it up if you have to.

1130
01:21:31,676 --> 01:21:33,769
You think you slick, huh?
Check her stuff, too.

1131
01:21:34,713 --> 01:21:36,180
You slick, right?

1132
01:21:38,183 --> 01:21:42,210
You better be here
for a good goddamn reason.

1133
01:21:42,254 --> 01:21:45,087
Money is a good goddamn reason.
Where is it?

1134
01:21:45,123 --> 01:21:47,114
What you talking about, money?

1135
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:49,252
l'm going to ask you
one more time.

1136
01:21:49,294 --> 01:21:51,353
Where's my money?

1137
01:21:51,396 --> 01:21:53,956
Cleo, look, l don't know
nothing about no money.

1138
01:21:53,999 --> 01:21:56,763
You don't know
what the fuck l'm talking about?

1139
01:21:56,802 --> 01:21:58,736
What the fuck is this, huh?

1140
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,034
Look at this shit--
watches and crystal...

1141
01:22:01,073 --> 01:22:03,541
and shit you done bought
with my motherfucking money.

1142
01:22:04,576 --> 01:22:06,203
Talking all that nonsense.

1143
01:22:06,244 --> 01:22:08,542
You don't know what
the hell l'm talking about.

1144
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,048
Now look...

1145
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,550
l ain't lying.

1146
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:14,074
What the fuck is this?

1147
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,878
My money.

1148
01:22:16,922 --> 01:22:19,755
All right, bro.

1149
01:22:22,094 --> 01:22:24,995
Oh, my God.

1150
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:30,930
Oh, fuck.

1151
01:22:37,776 --> 01:22:40,006
''Alissa Lyons, 423 Moorpark.''

1152
01:22:40,045 --> 01:22:42,104
You didn't see
none of this shit, right?

1153
01:22:45,117 --> 01:22:46,914
All right. Just a little
fucking insurance, baby.

1154
01:22:46,952 --> 01:22:50,683
Now where the fuck
did Luther hide that money?

1155
01:22:50,722 --> 01:22:51,746
l swear l don't know.

1156
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:55,487
Damn it, don't give me that!
You know!

1157
01:22:55,527 --> 01:22:56,687
l swear l just met him.

1158
01:22:56,728 --> 01:22:59,663
-Come on.
-Give me the money!

1159
01:22:59,698 --> 01:23:01,222
Come on!

1160
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:15,046
l'll call you.

1161
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,071
l hope so.

1162
01:23:20,585 --> 01:23:23,076
This weekend. ltalian.

1163
01:23:27,926 --> 01:23:29,917
l'll call you.

1164
01:23:42,874 --> 01:23:44,068
Man, l ain't trying to hear
this shit today.

1165
01:23:44,109 --> 01:23:46,077
Which one of you girls
smoked Luther?

1166
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:48,079
l'm thinking it was you...

1167
01:23:48,113 --> 01:23:50,081
because you're the only one
with any priors.

1168
01:23:50,115 --> 01:23:52,083
l don't know what the fuck
you talking about.

1169
01:23:52,117 --> 01:23:54,085
l'll tell you what the fuck
l'm talking about.

1170
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:56,087
We're going to take a ride
down to Parker Center.

1171
01:23:56,121 --> 01:23:59,579
Man, you ain't
got probable cause for shit.

1172
01:23:59,624 --> 01:24:01,319
All you're doing
is participating in a lineup.

1173
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:03,554
And for the record,
having a witness...

1174
01:24:03,595 --> 01:24:06,029
is one fuck of a lot better
than probable cause.

1175
01:24:06,064 --> 01:24:07,554
Get in the car.

1176
01:24:09,067 --> 01:24:10,500
Today!

1177
01:24:12,337 --> 01:24:14,305
Take this home. Call the girls.

1178
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:22,477
-They can't see me?
-Just your imagination.

1179
01:24:22,514 --> 01:24:24,038
Looks like
they're looking right at me.

1180
01:24:24,082 --> 01:24:25,549
Do you see her?

1181
01:24:26,618 --> 01:24:28,552
The person
that killed Luther Morris?

1182
01:24:28,587 --> 01:24:31,055
Take your time and concentrate.

1183
01:24:34,726 --> 01:24:35,886
Face right!

1184
01:24:44,603 --> 01:24:45,729
Do you see her--

1185
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,670
the person that killed
Luther Morris?

1186
01:24:52,544 --> 01:24:54,136
No. lt's not her.

1187
01:24:55,113 --> 01:24:56,478
Be sure now.

1188
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:59,277
Do you see her--

1189
01:24:59,317 --> 01:25:02,081
the person that killed
Luther Morris?

1190
01:25:06,057 --> 01:25:07,649
Look at her!

1191
01:25:07,692 --> 01:25:09,182
Get a real good look,
real close.

1192
01:25:09,227 --> 01:25:11,218
Right there. See her?

1193
01:25:11,997 --> 01:25:13,624
The person that smoked Luther.

1194
01:25:14,532 --> 01:25:15,692
Nope.

1195
01:25:18,837 --> 01:25:19,997
Can l go now?

1196
01:25:33,218 --> 01:25:34,412
You're real cute.

1197
01:25:37,255 --> 01:25:39,553
They got Cleo,
and y'all fucking killed Luther!

1198
01:25:39,591 --> 01:25:41,491
He wouldn't give up the money.

1199
01:25:42,427 --> 01:25:44,861
He was about to kill Cleo,
so Tisean shot him.

1200
01:25:44,896 --> 01:25:46,796
Now l got Cleo in trouble.

1201
01:25:46,831 --> 01:25:49,163
-Damn it! Shit!
-l'm sorry, Stony.

1202
01:25:51,102 --> 01:25:52,399
Look...

1203
01:25:53,371 --> 01:25:55,703
they're going to be
after all of us.

1204
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:57,799
We're going to take that bank
downtown. Are you in?

1205
01:25:57,842 --> 01:26:00,538
No, l ain't in! Hell, no!

1206
01:26:01,713 --> 01:26:03,681
You ain't got no fucking choice.

1207
01:26:03,715 --> 01:26:07,344
And you don't tell me what
fucking choices l have, Frankie!

1208
01:26:09,854 --> 01:26:12,084
That's armed robbery...

1209
01:26:12,123 --> 01:26:13,488
and it's murder.

1210
01:26:15,493 --> 01:26:18,985
You said we weren't going
to hurt anybody, Frankie.

1211
01:26:20,832 --> 01:26:22,857
Girl, l got to have money
before my court date.

1212
01:26:22,901 --> 01:26:24,232
l have to.

1213
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:27,870
And l can't go to jail...

1214
01:26:27,906 --> 01:26:29,703
for killing nobody.

1215
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:32,473
l need you.

1216
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:35,436
l really need you.

1217
01:26:39,117 --> 01:26:40,641
Cleo, what happened?
You all right?

1218
01:26:40,685 --> 01:26:42,175
Baby, go pack our shit.

1219
01:26:43,088 --> 01:26:45,056
Them motherfuckers
was all over me...

1220
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:46,557
but l represented.

1221
01:26:46,591 --> 01:26:48,752
Now the problem is,
they on our ass now...

1222
01:26:48,793 --> 01:26:50,988
and we got to do two things--

1223
01:26:51,029 --> 01:26:53,623
rob another bank
and get the fuck out of here--

1224
01:26:53,665 --> 01:26:55,599
or we going to be in jail
by tomorrow morning.

1225
01:26:55,633 --> 01:26:57,533
l say we hit Downtown Federal.

1226
01:26:57,569 --> 01:26:59,002
That's where
the most money's at.

1227
01:26:59,037 --> 01:27:02,404
l'm telling y'all, we could get
five hundred thousand.

1228
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,203
Fuck it. We hitting that shit.
Simple as that.

1229
01:27:10,815 --> 01:27:13,340
Look, Stony, we hot!

1230
01:27:14,586 --> 01:27:16,110
We all facing a murder rap!

1231
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:18,952
Does it have to be
Downtown Federal?

1232
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:20,423
What the fuck is that?

1233
01:27:21,292 --> 01:27:23,123
What, did you go and play us...

1234
01:27:23,161 --> 01:27:24,890
over that bumpy at the bank?

1235
01:27:34,973 --> 01:27:36,133
Fine.

1236
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:42,372
lt's on.

1237
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:53,589
l know you have a court date
tomorrow.

1238
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:55,593
Good luck, Tisean.

1239
01:27:55,627 --> 01:27:56,958
Thanks, Ms. Wells.

1240
01:27:58,663 --> 01:28:00,358
l think everything's
going to be OK.

1241
01:28:02,867 --> 01:28:04,300
l'm sure it is.

1242
01:28:05,603 --> 01:28:07,036
Come here.

1243
01:28:08,673 --> 01:28:10,664
Everything's going to be
just fine.

1244
01:28:12,777 --> 01:28:13,835
Come on. Let's go.

1245
01:28:34,699 --> 01:28:36,462
OK, ladies, will that be all?

1246
01:28:36,501 --> 01:28:37,934
Some more coffee.

1247
01:28:46,978 --> 01:28:49,776
l don't think you should be
drinking so much coffee.

1248
01:28:49,814 --> 01:28:51,782
You making me nervous.

1249
01:28:51,816 --> 01:28:54,046
How the fuck is my drinking
coffee making you nervous?

1250
01:28:54,085 --> 01:28:57,521
-l don't know. lt just is.
-OK, OK. Listen up.

1251
01:28:57,555 --> 01:28:59,921
Nobody's ever successfully
robbed this bank.

1252
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:01,755
l wish you would stop
saying that.

1253
01:29:01,793 --> 01:29:04,227
The nearest freeway
is a mile away.

1254
01:29:04,262 --> 01:29:05,991
We got to stick to the plan,
all right?

1255
01:29:13,004 --> 01:29:14,972
l know y'all sick of wearing
them wigs.

1256
01:29:15,006 --> 01:29:16,166
What you got?

1257
01:29:24,148 --> 01:29:25,513
l got some other stuff
in the car.

1258
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:27,017
Thank you, ladies.

1259
01:29:32,457 --> 01:29:34,584
Cover my share until l finish
robbing this bank.

1260
01:29:36,694 --> 01:29:38,286
Shoot, l'm broke.

1261
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:40,959
Don't look over here. l am, too.

1262
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,361
Y'all...

1263
01:29:44,402 --> 01:29:46,836
we don't have enough money
to pay the bill.

1264
01:30:19,537 --> 01:30:20,697
We're in.

1265
01:30:28,046 --> 01:30:29,206
Bullshit.

1266
01:30:29,247 --> 01:30:31,374
-What the fuck is this?
-What are you doing?

1267
01:30:32,317 --> 01:30:33,978
Trying to find some mood music.

1268
01:30:34,919 --> 01:30:36,386
Fuck it. Radio.

1269
01:30:46,397 --> 01:30:47,557
Look at that.

1270
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:01,708
Yo, what's up with that dress?
You going dancing or something?

1271
01:31:04,015 --> 01:31:05,505
What you got?

1272
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:06,710
One for you...

1273
01:31:08,052 --> 01:31:10,543
one for you.

1274
01:31:10,588 --> 01:31:11,816
Check it out.

1275
01:31:11,856 --> 01:31:13,824
There has been
a rash of these robberies...

1276
01:31:13,858 --> 01:31:17,055
in the Los Angeles area
as far east as Pasadena...

1277
01:31:17,095 --> 01:31:19,723
and as far north as
the San Fernando Valley.

1278
01:31:20,632 --> 01:31:23,567
They seem to know
the inner workings of each bank.

1279
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:27,469
Wigs and sunglasses
aid them in their disguise.

1280
01:31:27,505 --> 01:31:30,065
Their m.o. is ''in and out.''

1281
01:31:30,108 --> 01:31:31,905
Please do not be misled
by the fact...

1282
01:31:31,943 --> 01:31:34,377
that these four bandits
are females.

1283
01:31:35,213 --> 01:31:36,339
Once they get in here,
it's not going to be...

1284
01:31:36,381 --> 01:31:38,110
''Stick them up
and give me your dough.''

1285
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:41,277
Your lives are going to be
in jeopardy, and that's a fact.

1286
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,044
These girls are the real deal.

1287
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:48,056
They've gotten real good at
casing the banks they knock off.

1288
01:31:50,561 --> 01:31:52,358
Yes. Keith Weston, please.

1289
01:31:52,397 --> 01:31:54,456
What the fuck are you doing?

1290
01:31:54,499 --> 01:31:56,694
They know the intricacies
of bank security systems...

1291
01:31:56,734 --> 01:31:59,464
and more importantly, they know
how to get around them.

1292
01:31:59,504 --> 01:32:03,133
They may even have a contact
on the inside, so be aware.

1293
01:32:03,174 --> 01:32:05,039
Obviously,
they don't appear this way...

1294
01:32:05,076 --> 01:32:06,441
when they're on the street.

1295
01:32:06,477 --> 01:32:07,876
This is Keith.

1296
01:32:07,912 --> 01:32:09,038
Keith, listen to me.

1297
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,947
l need you to meet me
at the soul-food restaurant...

1298
01:32:11,983 --> 01:32:14,247
in five minutes.

1299
01:32:14,285 --> 01:32:15,445
Baby, why--

1300
01:32:16,921 --> 01:32:18,183
l'm leaving right now.

1301
01:32:20,091 --> 01:32:21,251
You be there.

1302
01:32:26,297 --> 01:32:27,662
Come on. Let's do this.

1303
01:32:30,334 --> 01:32:31,494
T.T.

1304
01:32:33,604 --> 01:32:35,629
Detective Strode.

1305
01:32:35,673 --> 01:32:36,833
You have a question?

1306
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:40,670
Are we done here?

1307
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,670
Actually,
we're just wrapping up.

1308
01:32:43,715 --> 01:32:46,240
l'm going to leave
a copy of that tape here.

1309
01:32:46,284 --> 01:32:47,876
-Thank you for your time.
-l'll show you out the back.

1310
01:32:47,919 --> 01:32:49,079
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1311
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,111
Please be safe.
Please be careful.

1312
01:32:57,562 --> 01:32:59,621
All right. Y'all do your thing.

1313
01:33:17,615 --> 01:33:19,310
Now get down and don't move!

1314
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:21,910
-Get the fuck down!
-Get down, everybody!

1315
01:33:21,953 --> 01:33:23,113
Don't move!

1316
01:33:24,255 --> 01:33:26,655
-Get down!
-l said down!

1317
01:33:27,825 --> 01:33:28,985
Get the fuck on the ground!

1318
01:33:31,662 --> 01:33:32,822
Right now! You!

1319
01:33:34,298 --> 01:33:35,492
Put your hands up!

1320
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:44,264
Down!

1321
01:33:47,145 --> 01:33:49,045
Don't fuck with me today!

1322
01:33:49,814 --> 01:33:51,941
Put your hands up! That's right.

1323
01:34:00,124 --> 01:34:01,216
Down!

1324
01:34:04,595 --> 01:34:05,892
Can l get you anything?

1325
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:07,090
No, thank you.

1326
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:18,834
All units, silent alarm...

1327
01:34:18,876 --> 01:34:20,867
Downtown Federal building,
Seventh and Spring.

1328
01:34:20,912 --> 01:34:23,403
Proceed with extreme caution.
Suspects armed and dangerous.

1329
01:34:23,447 --> 01:34:24,573
Can you believe this?

1330
01:34:24,615 --> 01:34:26,048
-God damn it!
-Shit!

1331
01:34:28,986 --> 01:34:30,453
Don't move!

1332
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,820
Let's make it!

1333
01:34:41,232 --> 01:34:42,358
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1334
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,494
Don't move!
We got a minute and a half.

1335
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:49,103
You, down! You, don't move!

1336
01:35:06,424 --> 01:35:07,686
Get some more money.

1337
01:35:11,629 --> 01:35:13,324
Don't be greedy. Let's go now!

1338
01:35:13,364 --> 01:35:14,524
Get it now!

1339
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,128
Let's go.

1340
01:35:18,336 --> 01:35:19,633
Don't move!

1341
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,035
Stay down!

1342
01:35:21,072 --> 01:35:23,063
Hands out in front of you!
Come on!

1343
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:26,332
Let's go!

1344
01:35:27,311 --> 01:35:29,472
Don't move.
Don't make me hurt nobody.

1345
01:35:29,513 --> 01:35:30,844
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

1346
01:35:30,882 --> 01:35:32,281
Thank you for your cooperation.

1347
01:35:32,316 --> 01:35:33,874
Yeah, we goin'.

1348
01:35:33,918 --> 01:35:35,146
Move it!

1349
01:35:38,356 --> 01:35:40,790
Ladies and gentlemen,
nice and smooth.

1350
01:35:40,825 --> 01:35:42,292
Stay down! Don't move!

1351
01:35:42,326 --> 01:35:43,725
Lita Newsome!

1352
01:35:47,732 --> 01:35:49,097
Don't do this!

1353
01:35:49,133 --> 01:35:51,795
Put the gun down. Put it down!

1354
01:35:51,836 --> 01:35:53,326
Don't do this. Cleo!

1355
01:35:54,772 --> 01:35:56,296
Fuck you.

1356
01:36:00,011 --> 01:36:02,206
l know the deal. l do.

1357
01:36:02,246 --> 01:36:03,713
And l'm sorry about
your brother.

1358
01:36:03,748 --> 01:36:04,874
l'm sorry about Stevie.

1359
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:07,316
l'm sorry he's dead,
l swear to God.

1360
01:36:07,351 --> 01:36:08,545
But don't do this!

1361
01:36:08,586 --> 01:36:10,577
Stevie was enough!

1362
01:36:10,621 --> 01:36:12,316
He was enough.

1363
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:15,420
No more killing!

1364
01:36:16,527 --> 01:36:17,687
Put the weapon down.

1365
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,860
Stevie was enough.

1366
01:36:27,505 --> 01:36:28,938
Stony, put it down.

1367
01:36:29,674 --> 01:36:30,834
Come on.

1368
01:36:31,709 --> 01:36:32,869
There you go.

1369
01:36:39,083 --> 01:36:40,710
What are you doing?

1370
01:36:55,933 --> 01:36:58,458
Motherfucker!

1371
01:37:14,518 --> 01:37:15,883
Help me.

1372
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,046
Hold on!

1373
01:37:17,088 --> 01:37:18,715
Come on, baby. Come on!

1374
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:35,136
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go!

1375
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:37,400
Hurry up!

1376
01:37:38,676 --> 01:37:40,405
Back it up, back it up!

1377
01:38:03,868 --> 01:38:05,096
You'll be OK.

1378
01:38:06,203 --> 01:38:07,534
Come on, Frankie!

1379
01:38:07,571 --> 01:38:09,368
Damn! Damn! Damn!

1380
01:38:09,407 --> 01:38:11,170
What happened?
What happened to her?

1381
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:13,199
We robbed this motherfucker,
and she gonna be all right!

1382
01:38:13,244 --> 01:38:15,872
Frankie, listen. l need you
to drive this car really fast...

1383
01:38:15,913 --> 01:38:18,404
and get us
to the hospital, OK? Go!

1384
01:38:18,449 --> 01:38:19,677
This motherfucker's
not going to make it.

1385
01:38:19,717 --> 01:38:21,150
We got to switch cars!

1386
01:38:21,185 --> 01:38:22,345
You do what you got to do.

1387
01:38:23,487 --> 01:38:24,647
You listen to me!

1388
01:38:26,123 --> 01:38:27,522
You are gonna make it
through this.

1389
01:38:27,558 --> 01:38:30,152
You understand me?
lt doesn't hurt.

1390
01:38:30,194 --> 01:38:32,094
We've been through
a lot together, haven't we?

1391
01:38:32,129 --> 01:38:33,926
-l'm OK.
-That's what l want to hear.

1392
01:38:33,964 --> 01:38:35,989
l want to hear you're OK.

1393
01:38:36,033 --> 01:38:37,728
Yes, l know you OK.

1394
01:38:37,768 --> 01:38:39,963
Just hold on for me, baby, OK?

1395
01:38:40,004 --> 01:38:42,871
Come on, Frankie, man,
drive this car!

1396
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,449
You better tell them
to hurry up.

1397
01:39:00,891 --> 01:39:02,483
Come on, you guys!

1398
01:39:06,664 --> 01:39:08,723
He gonna be mad at you.

1399
01:39:11,202 --> 01:39:13,261
You don't worry about Keith, OK?

1400
01:39:14,905 --> 01:39:16,338
lf you're worried about
that tattoo...

1401
01:39:16,373 --> 01:39:18,000
you're going to get over
that hole.

1402
01:39:21,812 --> 01:39:23,439
You know what l could use
right now?

1403
01:39:25,082 --> 01:39:27,448
l could use a banana flamb.

1404
01:39:29,253 --> 01:39:31,153
Remember
those banana flambs we had

1405
01:39:31,188 --> 01:39:32,951
that time at that restaurant?

1406
01:39:34,191 --> 01:39:35,590
They were so good.

1407
01:39:36,894 --> 01:39:38,088
Remember?

1408
01:39:44,802 --> 01:39:46,633
Come on, Stony,
we got it started!

1409
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:48,763
Let's get her! Come on! Come on!

1410
01:40:17,935 --> 01:40:20,904
-Sorry, T.T.
-We can't stay. Let's go!

1411
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:47,327
Come on, let's move it!

1412
01:41:03,847 --> 01:41:05,712
Suspects are coming closer now.

1413
01:41:05,749 --> 01:41:07,740
Police reports
indicate that the women...

1414
01:41:07,785 --> 01:41:09,218
are from Los Angeles.

1415
01:41:09,253 --> 01:41:10,379
They've been identified...

1416
01:41:10,421 --> 01:41:12,582
as Lita Newsome,
Francesca Sutton...

1417
01:41:12,623 --> 01:41:15,251
Tisean Williams,
and Cleopatra Simms.

1418
01:41:15,292 --> 01:41:17,226
You've just seen
these alleged bank robbers...

1419
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:20,753
avoid an L.A.P.D. blockade
on the First Street bridge.

1420
01:41:20,798 --> 01:41:23,631
However, the police
are still on the suspects' tail.

1421
01:41:23,667 --> 01:41:25,999
We'll try to follow the action
as best we can...

1422
01:41:26,036 --> 01:41:28,027
You got to drive faster!

1423
01:41:57,635 --> 01:42:00,103
Faster! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1424
01:42:07,011 --> 01:42:08,706
That was a close one.
Here we go again...

1425
01:42:08,746 --> 01:42:11,044
the suspects
barely getting away this time.

1426
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:14,073
l don't see any police vehicles
in pursuit at the moment...

1427
01:42:14,118 --> 01:42:16,086
but the L.A.P.D. helicopter
next to ours...

1428
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:18,088
has clearly got a bead on them.

1429
01:42:18,122 --> 01:42:20,647
l just checked with the L.A.P.D.
liaison, by the way.

1430
01:42:20,691 --> 01:42:23,922
He's reporting
that this 1962 Chevy lmpala...

1431
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:29,098
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1432
01:42:29,133 --> 01:42:30,293
l'm going!

1433
01:42:41,111 --> 01:42:42,339
l think l lost them.

1434
01:42:42,379 --> 01:42:43,971
You lost them ! You're good.

1435
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:48,679
We have visual contact
with suspects' vehicle...

1436
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:50,016
on Second Street tunnel.

1437
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:54,021
-Shit!
-Damn!

1438
01:42:54,958 --> 01:42:56,152
Damn it!

1439
01:42:59,997 --> 01:43:01,089
What are you doing?

1440
01:43:02,733 --> 01:43:04,291
-Come on.
-Fuck!

1441
01:43:09,106 --> 01:43:11,097
OK, let's think.
Let's think. Let's think.

1442
01:43:13,777 --> 01:43:15,267
-All right, get out.
-What?

1443
01:43:17,381 --> 01:43:20,509
Get out
and lean up against the wall...

1444
01:43:20,551 --> 01:43:22,746
and in sixty seconds,
l want you to run that way.

1445
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:24,378
Cleo, fuck, no! Hell, no!

1446
01:43:24,421 --> 01:43:26,616
Stony, shut up!
We got to split up!

1447
01:43:26,657 --> 01:43:28,124
We got to.

1448
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:30,592
Look, l'll catch up to y'all
later, l promise.

1449
01:43:30,627 --> 01:43:33,323
-What about the money?
-Just hold on to it.

1450
01:43:34,898 --> 01:43:36,126
Come on.

1451
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:45,535
Come on. Let's go.

1452
01:43:55,219 --> 01:43:56,379
All right, motherfuckers.

1453
01:43:57,054 --> 01:43:58,521
Suspects are on the move.

1454
01:43:59,757 --> 01:44:01,486
You want it? Here it go.

1455
01:44:03,694 --> 01:44:05,059
Here we go! Me and you!

1456
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:08,295
They're gonna ram us!

1457
01:44:38,228 --> 01:44:39,752
We got to dump these clothes.

1458
01:44:50,307 --> 01:44:51,433
l love you.

1459
01:44:51,475 --> 01:44:54,467
Oh, God. You be careful, OK?

1460
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:17,291
And now the police
are all over the suspects' tail.

1461
01:45:17,334 --> 01:45:18,824
Ain't that your girls?

1462
01:45:20,170 --> 01:45:21,330
Hell, yeah.

1463
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:24,368
Damn. That's fucked up.

1464
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,949
l just checked with the L.A.P.D.
liaison, by the way.

1465
01:45:34,985 --> 01:45:36,350
He's reporting
that this 1962 Chevy...

1466
01:45:36,386 --> 01:45:39,981
They through.
Helicopters and shit.

1467
01:45:40,824 --> 01:45:42,587
Ain't no escapin' that shit.

1468
01:45:42,626 --> 01:45:43,888
Get set!

1469
01:45:44,928 --> 01:45:46,088
Hold your positions!

1470
01:46:05,215 --> 01:46:06,978
Step out of your vehicle...

1471
01:46:07,017 --> 01:46:08,541
with your hands in the air.

1472
01:46:14,992 --> 01:46:16,687
Step out of your vehicle...

1473
01:46:17,528 --> 01:46:19,223
keeping your hands in the air.

1474
01:48:42,839 --> 01:48:43,999
We've just had...

1475
01:48:46,576 --> 01:48:47,975
a horrible moment here.

1476
01:48:49,946 --> 01:48:51,573
This is...

1477
01:48:51,615 --> 01:48:54,675
our greatest fears
for what would happen today.

1478
01:48:55,952 --> 01:48:57,112
This is the most...

1479
01:48:58,989 --> 01:49:01,321
tragic culmination
of the day's events.

1480
01:49:04,594 --> 01:49:05,754
Damn.

1481
01:49:21,044 --> 01:49:22,409
Dad, sit down.

1482
01:49:43,366 --> 01:49:46,460
Freeze! Drop the bag! Get your
hands where we can see them !

1483
01:49:46,503 --> 01:49:48,664
Slowly turn around
and drop your weapon!

1484
01:49:48,705 --> 01:49:50,070
Get your hands up!

1485
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:57,740
Wait!

1486
01:49:59,449 --> 01:50:01,508
Wait now. You wait, Waller!

1487
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:04,150
God damn it, you wait.

1488
01:50:08,091 --> 01:50:10,355
Listen to me.
l'm taking it off here.

1489
01:50:10,393 --> 01:50:12,588
l'm not carrying, OK?

1490
01:50:14,898 --> 01:50:16,729
l got nothin'. You wait!

1491
01:50:23,774 --> 01:50:24,934
Tisean is dead.

1492
01:50:26,243 --> 01:50:27,642
Cleo is dead. She's dead.

1493
01:50:29,045 --> 01:50:30,410
All you got is you...

1494
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:34,111
and now you got to save you.

1495
01:50:34,151 --> 01:50:35,311
Do you understand me?

1496
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,551
Now, l need you on the ground.

1497
01:50:48,298 --> 01:50:50,129
Wait!

1498
01:50:50,167 --> 01:50:52,567
What's the procedure when
you got a gun at your head, huh?

1499
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:56,068
What's the fucking procedure...

1500
01:50:56,106 --> 01:50:57,937
when you got a gun at your head?

1501
01:51:04,748 --> 01:51:06,045
lt's over.

1502
01:52:55,825 --> 01:52:57,224
We did it!

1503
01:53:16,613 --> 01:53:18,774
Cleo! Sit!

1504
01:53:25,422 --> 01:53:28,084
Man, l remember
you was just a little scrub...

1505
01:53:28,124 --> 01:53:30,456
always trying
to follow us around.

1506
01:54:56,346 --> 01:54:58,337
Stony, l'm glad you're safe.

1507
01:54:58,381 --> 01:54:59,575
l am.

1508
01:55:05,021 --> 01:55:06,181
Thank you.
