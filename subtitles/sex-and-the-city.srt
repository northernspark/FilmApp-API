CARRIE: <i>Year after year, 20-something</i>
<i>women come to New York City...</i>

3
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,111
<i>... in search of the two L 's:</i>

4
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,478
<i>Labels and love.</i>

5
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,515
- Yeah.
- He's the best.

6
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,716
WOMAN:
Hot dress!

7
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,220
<i>Twenty years ago, I was one of them.</i>

8
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:18,438
<i>Having gotten the knack for labels early,</i>
<i>I concentrated on my search for love.</i>

9
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,776
<i>Turns out, a knockoff is not as easy to spot</i>
<i>when it comes to love.</i>

10
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,850
What? You're married?

11
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,283
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

12
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,787
<i>- Until it is.</i>
- I fucking hate you.

13
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,391
<i>That is why you need help to spot them.</i>

14
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,554
<i>Lots of help.</i>

15
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,755
<i>Help also known as Charlotte York...</i>

16
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,233
<i>... Miranda Hobbes...</i>

17
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:43,833
<i>... and Samantha Jones.</i>

18
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,539
- Oh, my God, look at his.
MAN: Hey.

19
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,070
Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:53,939
Oh, well.

21
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:59,842
<i>My name is Carrie Bradshaw,</i>
<i>and I'm a writer.</i>

22
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:03,821
<i>Year after year,</i>
<i>my single girlfriends were my salvation.</i>

23
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,619
<i>And as it turns out, my meal ticket.</i>

24
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,855
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

25
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:14,433
<i>Charlotte was looking</i>
<i>for the perfect love.</i>

26
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,662
- Trey can't get it up.
<i>- Well, almost perfect.</i>

27
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,362
I'm becoming a Jew.

28
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,543
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

29
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,944
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

30
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:32,517
<i>So Charlotte and Harry journeyed</i>
<i>to China and back...</i>

31
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,881
<i>... for their daughter, Lily.</i>

32
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,248
<i>Miranda was a disciple of tough love.</i>

33
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:40,121
Bye. Great sex.

34
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,554
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

35
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:44,755
Carrie.

36
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,799
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

37
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,994
<i>And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn</i>
<i>for Brady and Steve.</i>

38
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,333
Who wants a Popsicle?

39
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,475
Oh, man. Boy.

40
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,578
<i>Samantha's love was sex.</i>

41
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,270
<i>Lots of sex.</i>

42
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,973
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

43
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,481
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

44
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,247
<i>And then she found a man</i>
<i>that combined sex and love.</i>

45
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,753
I'm gonna help you be a star.

46
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,822
Yes, he is interested...

47
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:18,226
<i>So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood</i>
<i>with television star Smith Jerrod.</i>

48
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,632
<i>As for me,</i>
<i>I was looking for something big.</i>

49
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,101
Get in.

50
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:31,302
<i>Mr. Big. Turns out when that big</i>
<i>love comes along, it's not always easy.</i>

51
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,739
CARRIE:
Just tell me I'm the one.

52
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,041
<i>And despite all the other chapters</i>
<i>of my life...</i>

53
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,709
<i>... no one was ever quite</i>
<i>big enough until...</i>

54
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,184
Carrie, you're the one.

55
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:44,256
<i>And just like that, I was.</i>

56
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,657
<i>Three books and three years later...</i>

57
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,595
<i>... we still feel like those four single girls.</i>

58
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,326
<i>And even though time had moved us on...</i>

59
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:59,064
<i>... I managed to stay exactly where I was:</i>

60
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,400
<i>In love.</i>

61
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,416
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

62
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,591
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.

63
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,819
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

64
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,788
Hi, 3C?

65
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,832
<i>Finding the perfect apartment</i>
<i>in New York City...</i>

66
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:31,665
<i>... is like finding the perfect partner.</i>
<i>It can take years.</i>

67
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,536
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

68
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,870
Lucky 33.

69
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:46,018
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

70
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,082
CAROL:
That's the window with the best view.

71
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,517
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

72
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:58,021
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

73
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,032
We're very interested in this building.

74
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:04,069
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

75
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,500
Care to take a look?

76
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:06,697
- Sure.
- Sure.

77
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,432
All right, then.

78
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,840
It's more than you were looking to pay.

79
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,310
- How much more?
- More.

80
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,619
So this is where they keep the light.

81
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,852
Oh, my God.

82
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:32,897
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

83
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,969
Just a simple home for two.

84
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:40,507
And across the rooftop terrace...

85
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,938
What, nirvana?

86
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,108
Hello. I live here.

87
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,447
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

88
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,718
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

89
00:05:57,258 --> 00:05:59,055
This way.

90
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:03,856
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

91
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,865
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

92
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,766
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

93
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,339
And this is the master bedroom.

94
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,770
Uh.

95
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:20,209
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

96
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:25,182
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

97
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:28,480
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

98
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,292
Hm.

99
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:40,126
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

100
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,570
Welcome home, baby.

101
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,740
Can...? Can we afford this?

102
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,604
I got it.

103
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,346
BIG:
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

104
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,778
"I got it." Just like that.

105
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,919
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

106
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,351
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

107
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,150
And he says the kitchen needs work.

108
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:07,658
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

109
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,955
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

110
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,427
Yes, together. That's right.

111
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,260
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

112
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,995
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

113
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,571
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

114
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,833
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

115
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,442
And I love you for that.

116
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,170
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

117
00:07:26,347 --> 00:07:29,544
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

118
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:35,184
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

119
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:37,187
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

120
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:40,259
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

121
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,328
<i>New York</i> magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

122
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,328
Whoever wrote that lives in Brooklyn.

123
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,899
- Hey, there she is. Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

124

"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire."

141
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,188
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

142
