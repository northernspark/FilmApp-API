Hey, man. Do you have a
bathroom that we could use?

No.

Look, man,
we wanna fuck
in the bagel bathroom.

You just tell me
what that's gonna take.

Nothing. You can't.
I'll tell you what.

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,643
Give me every
fucking bagel you got.

I'll buy you out,
and then I'm gonna
bang in the bagel room.

a bagel off my cock.

Guys, I'm sorry,
but this isn't gonna happen.

I don't sympathize.

Hey, didn't you
teach geometry
a couple of years ago?

17
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:46,732
No.

He did.

He was our fucking

Holy shit.
Yes, you're right.

- Or I'll call the police.

doing in my room?

lay down a towel.

[ Man ]
Dude, you were born
to teach.

I was, man.
I'm a good teacher.

65
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:26,658
When I was a student teacher,
our math team went to
the motherfucking state finals.

66
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,727
You goddamn right they did.
You gave those nerds
something to live for.

67
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,063
You don't get
to the state finals
by being nice, man.

68
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,666
Geometry isn't nice.
It's fucking hard.
Pythagorean theorem?

what that is.
- I am sick and tired...

they owe me a goddamn interview.

Yes! Yes!

00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,751
Yes!
Yes!

76
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,723
What is a cock bagel?

77
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,073
Hi. You rejected
my application without
ever giving me an interview.

78
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,775
And I deserve
an interview.

Let's see this résumé.

82
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,392
It says here you
student-taught at Bradenton.
Good school.

83
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,993
I really enjoyed
that experience,

84
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,462
and I actually
started a math team
that went to the state finals.

85
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,065
I used to work
with kindergartners before
they put me behind the desk.

86
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,033
Oh.
God, I loved
those fucking kids.

87
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,469
Great hugs.
And their smiles?

88
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,005
Gives you a reason
to wake up in the morning.

89
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,840
Absolutely.

90
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,043
You mind?
Totally.

91
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,746
You're allowed
to like drinking.
You know what I mean?

92
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,448
Sure. Of course.

93
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,451
That's why
I love those kids.

94
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:03,021
I mean, if I were sad
or maybe a little drunk--

95
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,525
They don't judge.
You know?

96
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:09,661
Maybe I worked my way
through an eight ball...

97
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:13,799
and woke up in St. Pete
with half a kitten
in a cardboard box.

98
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,534
Didn't matter.

99
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:19,504
Those little guys--
good for the hug, always.

100
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,909
Well, I've always thought
that a-- a nurturing approach...

101
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,911
is much better
than being an authoritarian.

102
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,646
That's why we do it.

103
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,748
We don't do it
for the bitches,
that's for certain.

104
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,784
No. I-- I do not do it
for the bitches either.

105
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,555
Well, not to say
I pay for sex.

106
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,990
I mean, strip club occasionally,
but that's no biggie.

107
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:41,193
There's nothing wrong
with a gentleman's club.

108
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,195
No, there isn't.

109
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:46,798
Me, personally,
big fan of Odyssey 2001.

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,100
You been there?
Uh, the strip club?

111
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:51,937
I think I've seen it
from the highway.
With the spaceship?

112
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,872
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:57,175
A good strip club has
to have a compelling theme.

114
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:00,712
Otherwise, you're just
jerking off in a warehouse.
You know?

115
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,817
Do you mind
if I give you some advice?
Please do.

116
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,820
This isn't teaching advice.
This is life advice.

117
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,889
Okay, cool.

118
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,659
Never do two illegal things
at the same time.

119
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,228
I like that advice.

120
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,530
Can I give you
some more advice?

121
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,233
Do not go to a strip club
in the town you live in.

122
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:24,102
Not even Odyssey?
Especially not Odyssey.

123
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,838
Why? Because it
becomes habitual.

124
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,008
Before you know it,
you're just stopping by
for a quick drink.

125
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,112
And the bartender's
mixing you a "G and T"
before you even asked for it.

126
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,281
Then one day you wake up...

127
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,617
and guess what happens.

128
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,819
I don't know what,
but it sounds bad.

129
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,121
You're married, man.
You're fucking married.

130
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,625
And your wife?
She's still working the pole
four nights a week.

131
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,927
Fuck me.

132
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,664
That's all I'm saying.

133
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,534
Write this shit down.
I brought a pad.

134
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,669
This is gold, man.

135
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,273
All right, "Edward Cole."

136
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:04,209
Right?
Eddie. Eddie's fine.

137
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,111
Eddie.
Yeah.

138
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07,779
Like Eddie Murphy.

139
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,615
So, what do you
wanna teach, Eddie?

140
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:12,551
I mean, ideal world.

141
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,152
Well, I was trained
to teach math.

142
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:18,323
And as I was saying,
our team went to
the state finals last year.

143
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,792
Good for you.
Well, the thing is...

144
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,295
we don't really have
any positions.

145
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,831
There's got
to be something.
Mm-mmm.

146
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,966
Oh, wait.

147
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,936
I do have something.

148
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,705
Done and done.

149
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,009
It's either Fourth
or Fisk Street.
I can't read it.

150
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,277
Fisk?

151
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,179
Fisk. Fourth or Fisk.

152
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,049
Good luck.

153
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,253
I got the job!

154
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,121
No way, dude!

The clap. Right.

not having sex at all--

I mean, we're making
some major generalizations here.

I mean, it's not like
all gay men are sluts.

and he'll pull your program,

and you--
you'll be out a job.

These kids need to learn
about their bodies.

Half of them are already
experimenting sexually.

Look, Eddie, truth be told,

I don't give a shit

about sex.

Well, unfortunately,
we can't do that today.

Do you get a boner
when you see my sister?

973
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:38,621
Or do you have a boner now
'cause you're thinking
about her?

No.

is think about Margarita,
and boom.

Well, I think that's 'cause
you're going through puberty
right now. So--

979
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,835
I hope so man.
Sometimes I'm like
a walking boner. You know?

980
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,537
It's why I can't
wear sweatpants anymore.

So--
Isn't it weird though?

00:52:57,909 --> 00:53:03,179
I was like, why does everybody
stop wearing sweatpants
in middle school?

983
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,281
And now I know why.
Very true.

that we could discuss
my after-school program.

See, here's the issue,
Mr. Cole.

995
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:42,551
I don't think that sex
or anything relating to it
should be taught in school.

I understand why
you feel that way--
I don't think you do.

997
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:47,723
Because I'm not just
some Bible thumper.

00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,558
I don't think there's
anything wrong with sex.

Sex is a beautiful thing.

That's great
that you have that
in your marriage.

1003
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,338
But sex is love,
and love is God.

1004
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,973
And teaching sex
without God is wrong...

1005
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:06,275
because you're
teaching a formula--

1006
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:08,010
a mechanical exchange of fluids,

1007
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,246
and if those children
see that as such,

1008
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:13,015
they're gonna do it,
early and often.

Maybe you could come
and observe a class,

'cause I think
once you saw it in action,

1011
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:19,955
you'd see
that we approach it
with the respect...

that it deserves.

Please raise your hands.

or me, a teacher?

1432
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:45,052
They learn about it
from each other...

1433
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,154
or from things
they've seen in movies...

or on the Internet,
with pornography.

They see images of men doing
strange and mean things
to women.

some sort of injury.

expect men to treat them badly.

maybe I'm not the right person
to be teaching this class.

that we can teach these kids.

Mr. Cole is
really important to us...

1448
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:44,178
because he tells us
straight about sex.

1449

it was normal and easy...

that sex like that
just isn't normal.

but I can ask Mr. Cole,

1460
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,385
and I know he'll give me
a real answer--

1461
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:27,254
that if two adults
mutually agree
that they wanna do anal,

1462
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:31,292
they can do it, provided
they use sufficient

Fine.

Did I ruin that for you?

all wanting a woman
and not gettin' her.

1539

It's having a woman

feel the madness.

We have kids coming
to this class...

1596
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:11,945
and you think you're gonna
have to explain them
anatomical or sexual things,

1597
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:14,448
but they're more
advanced than I am
with certain things.

1598
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:15,749
'Cause of what?
The Internet.

1599
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:20,487
Just with obscure
sexual positions.

1600
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:22,823
I mean, I'd love to know
what the kids know.

1601
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:25,726
I think it's against the law
to repeat something...

1602
01:29:25,728 --> 01:29:27,694
that a minor
tells you sexually,

1603
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:31,565
but now that I've done
my Internet research
to shore up my knowledge,

1604
01:29:31,567 --> 01:29:34,935
I feel like--
I feel like
I've aged 10 years.

1605
01:29:34,937 --> 01:29:36,803
When I was a young man,

1606
01:29:36,805 --> 01:29:39,506
you would just hint to a girl
like, "Oh, I got a big dick."

1607
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:43,076
You'd imply it?
Yeah. But that's it.

1608
01:29:43,078 --> 01:29:45,846
Pants were tighter back then.
You could probably--
Yeah, that's what guys did.

1609
01:29:45,848 --> 01:29:49,983
Or they would stuff, like,
a shoe in there or tin foil.
Definitely.

1610
01:29:49,985 --> 01:29:51,752
Or a narrow shoe.
A narrow shoe?

1611
01:29:51,754 --> 01:29:54,121
Otherwise it looks like
you have a deformed thing.

1612
01:29:54,123 --> 01:29:55,622
You don't want
to scare 'em off.

1613
01:29:55,624 --> 01:29:57,457
Like a goiter or something.

1614
01:29:57,459 --> 01:29:59,993
There is a disorder.
It's-- Oh, shoot.

1615
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:01,728
I should know this
for my job.

1616
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,097
But where one
of the components
in the testicles...

1617
01:30:04,099 --> 01:30:06,600
swells to such a size
that you have
to have it removed.

1618
01:30:06,602 --> 01:30:09,136
One of the components?
Like the vas deferens?

1619
01:30:09,138 --> 01:30:11,705
It might be the vas--
Or the Cowper's gland.

1620
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:13,740
That's the one
I always pretend
like I know, but--

1621
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,810
I know that one.
It's like the prostate
and the Cowper's adds--

1622
01:30:16,812 --> 01:30:19,479
I would look,
but my Google's down.

1623
01:30:19,481 --> 01:30:20,947
We gotta get
new textbooks.

1624
01:30:20,949 --> 01:30:23,650
The books that I have
are from 1983.
I know.

1625
01:30:23,652 --> 01:30:25,752
They're still
calling AIDS GRID.

1626
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,722
There's also--
It's embarrassing.

1627
01:30:28,724 --> 01:30:32,826
Okay.
They're still saying
masturbation is wrong.

1628
01:30:32,828 --> 01:30:36,196
Even monkeys masturbate.
They do. Bonobos.

1629
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:38,165
Yeah?
The apes.

1630
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:41,168
Yeah?
They use sex as--
Like trade.

1631
01:30:41,170 --> 01:30:44,104
They'll trade
sexual favors within
their bonombo colonies.

1632
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:47,441
Yeah.
They'll prostitute out people
to create peace between tribes.

1633
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:48,909
They will.
Yeah.

1634
01:30:48,911 --> 01:30:51,545
Look at--
I wouldn't teach that
in junior high.

1635
01:30:51,547 --> 01:30:54,948
That seems like
a higher-concept idea.
No.

1636
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,651
I'd like
more primatology too.

1637
01:30:57,653 --> 01:30:59,186
It's almost like grooming.

1638
01:30:59,188 --> 01:31:03,156
Like when they give cunnilingus
to another ape.
Grooming?

1639
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:06,226
Oh! Huh.
Yeah.

1640
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:08,595
That's fascinating.
Yeah.

1641
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:13,033
Speaking of grooming--
Mm-hmm?

1642
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:19,840
You ever get crabs?
I have not.
This-- Interesting fact.

1643
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:22,976
The crab is--
or the pubic louse--
is endangered.

1644
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:27,113
Good!
Because of modern
grooming habits.

1645
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:28,949
Very few people have that--

1646
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:32,619
In the videos that I found
of sex education...

1647
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:34,721
with, like,
serious hair down there,

1648
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:37,557
that's not really
the tendency these days.

1649
01:31:37,559 --> 01:31:39,626
Yeah.
So the louse
is going extinct.

1650
01:31:39,628 --> 01:31:41,228
That's good.
Like smallpox--

1651
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:44,064
Have you gotten--
I never got 'em. No.

1652
01:31:44,066 --> 01:31:47,667
Good.
I mean, I never looked,
but I'm assuming you'd know.

1653
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:49,903
I would probably
feel something.
