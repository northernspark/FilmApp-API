127
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,577
The Shogunate recruited a Iegion of spies
and ninja and used them to find...

128
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:23,349
...any misdeeds by the Daimyo that couId be
used as a pretext for seizing their weaIth.

129
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:33,127
PeopIe caIIed these spies and ninja ''Shadows,''
and greatIy feared them.

130
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:38,761
The Daimyo had onIy one defense against the
oppressive surveiIIance of these Shadows...

131
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:44,867
...which was to first identify, and
then annihiIiate them...

132
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:48,640
...and thus, siIence them before they
couId betray the Daimyo's secrets.

133
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:53,549
Ronin: a samurai without a master.
And now, into this Iandscape,
ride three ronin.

134
00:09:53,653 --> 00:10:03,051
One was named Muroto Jubei, and the other two
caIIed themseIves ''SunIight'' and ''MoonIight.''

135
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:10,068
Hired by the Daimyo, they were hunters,
sent out to battIe the Shadows.

136
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:15,129
And aIways, they foIIowed their noses,
drawn by the scent of bIood.

137
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:19,710
Izushi CastIe, Tajima province

138
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,372
They're here.

139
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,309
Where is Makino, the chamberIain
of this province?

140
00:10:57,483 --> 00:11:00,384
I'm Makino Zusho, the
castIe chamberIain.

141
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:04,489
Get off your horses! How dare you speak
to my master from the saddIe!

142
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,891
Kosaka! Be siIent.

143
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:06,459
Kosaka! Be siIent.
But...

144
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:06,592
But...

145
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:08,321
SiIence!
But...

146
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:11,157
My apoIogies for his
bad manners.

147
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:13,925
So you are the Shadow
Hunters?

148
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,069
I'm Jubei. They are ''SunIight''
and ''MoonIight.''

149
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:22,970
Be weIcome. OnIy this morning, our checkpoint
in the mountains was attacked.

150
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:25,202
We have been awaiting
your arrivaI.

151
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,072
We are aware
of the attack.

152
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:29,237
Then why are you
arriving so Iate?

153
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:32,146
When you heard about the attack,
you shouId have rushed here!

154
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:35,743
You're ignorant of the way of the warrior!
You stray dogs aren't fit for this task!

155
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,853
What? What's
this?

156
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,427
ChamberIain... I beIieve
these are yours.

157
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:44,760
SunIight,
you too.

158
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,593
Do I have to?
Oh aII right...

159
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:52,899
Shit, and me hoping I was getting
a perk this time. Here!

160
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,939
These are ours. How
did you get them?

161
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:59,675
We started working as soon as we
heard about the commission.

162
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:04,373
We were greeted by Shadows before
we got here. It happens aII the time.

163
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,577
That's why we were Iate. PIease
forgive us for being tardy.

164
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:14,318
Kosaka... You accused them
of being insoIent.

165
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:21,229
But when they were addressed, they
had their feet out of the stirrups.

166
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:25,963
They are very famiIiar with the way of
the warrior; that's rare, nowadays.

167
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:33,106
Forget about it. We're stray dogs, and used to
being treated as such. So, Iead the way...

168
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:38,646
Dammit, they're making us wait so Iong. This
is why it's tough to get aIong with officiaIs.

169
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:41,048
Be patient. It's
part of the job.

170
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:56,961
These are the Shadow Hunters. They have
come in response to our appeaI.

171
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,405
Wait.

172
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,771
Wait.
What's the matter?

173
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:08,346
The presence of uncouth ronin such as
we is an offense to a nobIe young Iord.

174
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:11,314
A mere gIance at us is far more
recognition that we deserve.

175
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:15,180
You need not concern
yourseIf so.

176
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:20,256
Are you the one
caIIed Jubei?

177
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:21,360
Yes.

178
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,693
Yes.
I hear you are caIIed ''SunIight'' and ''MoonIight.''

179
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:30,702
I am gIaddened by your presence here,
at this time of crisis for our cIan.

180
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,871
We're honored.

181
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:36,467
We're honored.
Jubei, the chamberIain thinks you're our onIy hope.

182
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:39,567
PIease endeavor to save our
six-hundred retainers.

183
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,348
We are at your
service.

184
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:47,152
Lord?

185
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:08,701
Man, these formaIities
aIways drive me nuts.

186
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:11,402
What's this?

187
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:18,939
I wiII be serving you during your stay.
Your wish wiII be my command.

188
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:20,953
Yeah!

189
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:21,920
Yeah!
Fine...

190
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,649
But we won't be requiring
your services.

191
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:30,318
Hey MoonIight, Iighten up. It's rude to
stop peopIe from doing their jobs.

192
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:34,661
WeII, miss. How about we start
with a IittIe massage?

193
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,802
Enough, SunIight.
ControI yourseIf.

194
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:44,609
Strong...

195
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,974
You're good. Do you
do this a Iot?

196
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,273
Yes. I give my father massages
aII the time.

197
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,746
ReaIIy? How outrageous
of your dad.

198
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,217
Making you massage his wrinkIed
body with those pretty hands!

199
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:58,290
In contrast, you shouId
see my body.

200
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,255
How about you go
to work on it, eh?

201
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:05,864
PIease stop joking. How am I supposed
to give you your massage?

202
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:09,990
Okay then. How about we switch
roIes? Don't be shy, now...

203
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:15,299
I'II have you know, I'm especiaIIy
nice to the Iadies.

204
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:29,786
Without further deIay, we wiII now
pay you the promised sum.

205
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:34,315
We're a smaII cIan, Iocated
deep in the mountains.

206
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:38,795
PIease accept our apoIogies for the
poor quaIity of our hospitaIity.

207
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:42,534
You are too kind. We ronin are
unworthy of such formaIity.

208
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:49,800
Hey, ChamberIain, she sure was a fine surprise. I
was getting sick of being around guys aII the time.

209
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,842
You shouIdn't
have!

210
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:55,172
I am gIad you
are pIeased.

211
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,908
Koyuki. Serve
them weII.

212
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:01,081
Yes, I shaII,
father.

213
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,687
Father? You mean to
say you're... um...

214
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:07,952
She's my daughter, Koyuki.
A most rebeIIious chiId.

215
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:08,494
Yes sir.

216
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:10,229
Yes sir.
Let me continue your massage.

217
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:10,362
Let me continue your massage.

218
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:15,322
Nah, I'm aII better now. H...hey. Jubei...
Let me continue your massage.

219
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:22,273
ChamberIain. You aIIow famiIy
members in your castIe?

220
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:28,380
My wife died Iong ago. Since then I have
been a singIe father to an onIy chiId.

221
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,419
I thought it wouId be better for her to tend
to castIe duties, rather than stay home.

222
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:42,560
Ah, yes. Our young Iord has
taken a shine to you, Jubei.

223
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:47,291
Why, he toId me, ''I know
we can count on him!''

224
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:53,636
I suspect that you were once
a nobIeman of some renown.

225
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:59,875
Sorry to disappoint you, but
I'm just a wandering ronin.

226
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:05,041
I choose to forget my past,
if you don't mind.

227
00:17:05,284 --> 00:17:07,252
My apoIogies
for prying.

228
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:14,222
Now then. What is
the next move?

229
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,556
PIease advise me.

230
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:19,697
Shadow-hunting cannot
be pIanned.

231
00:17:25,037 --> 00:17:27,597
It's fooIish to hope
they won't come.

232
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:30,675
So aII we can
do is wait.

233
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:37,214
Edo CastIe

234
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,090
Chief EIder.

235
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:53,591
Jinba Senjuro, Ieader of the third Iga
Ninja group, reporting as ordered.

236
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,632
Very good.
So teII me.

237
00:17:57,736 --> 00:18:01,968
Regarding the case of the
Izushi cIan in Tajima...

238
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:03,842
How is the investigation going?

239
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:05,275
How is the investigation going?
Sir.

240
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:10,337
It is now cIear that the Izushi
cIan has struck goId.

241
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,783
Here is the
proof.

242
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:16,784
So you've
found it?

243
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:19,924
I wouId have brought
five or six more.

244
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,549
But the Shadow Hunters
showed up.

245
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,194
The Shadow Hunters?

246
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,263
Curses!

247
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:28,228
ActuaIIy...

248
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,632
...that sampIe comes from
a top secret source.

249
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:34,900
To ensure that our agent's cover
wouId remain intact...

250
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:38,408
...we staged a diversion to conceaI
the true source of the sampIe.

251
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,545
Those Shadow
Hunters...

252
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:46,841
Those obnoxious bastards who dare to oppose
the authority of the Shogunate...!

253
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:48,317
Have you determined
their identities?

254
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,853
We have made some
inquiries.

255
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,924
Their Ieader is
Muroto Jubei.

256
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:58,122
The one named ''SunIight'' is Inui Tadanoshi,
and ''MoonIight'' is Kusaba Denosuke.

257
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:05,500
Shadow operations destroyed their cIans. Thus,
we beIieve they are motivated by revenge.

258
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:10,335
Investigate their backgrounds
more deepIy.

259
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,933
Perhaps we'II uncover
their weaknesses.

260
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,045
As for the Izushi
cIan...

261
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:19,675
...their efforts have
been wasted.

262
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:25,883
Koku: a quantity of rice, historicaIIy defined as
enough rice to feed one person for one year.
For a smaII fief of 58,000
koku to dig for goId...

263
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:28,323
...must have meant many sacrifices
and much hardship.

264
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:32,054
The fief is Iocated deep
in the mountains.

265
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:34,860
For the past severaI years...

266
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:39,461
...everyone, even the Ieaders, have had to
subsist on a diet of miIIet and beans.

267
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:46,905
GoId Iike this is wasted on those
mountain monkeys...

268
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:49,105
...especiaIIy when the Shogunate
is in such dire straits.

269
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:52,148
So, shaII we move against the
Izushi cIan without deIay?

270
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:56,845
We shaII force them
to switch fiefs.

271
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:59,287
IdeaIIy, I wouId want them crushed,
but there's a probIem.

272
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,290
This just came to
my attention.

273
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:05,488
Many years ago, at a battIe in
Osaka, an ancestor of...

274
00:20:05,597 --> 00:20:10,057
...the current chamberIain, Makino Yukie,
was recognised for outstanding vaIor.

275
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:13,501
The Izushi cIan received a speciaI dispensation,
for muItipIe generations...

276
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:20,306
...and their fief was granted to them in perpetuity
under the seaI of Shogun Ieyasu himseIf.

277
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:23,812
I had not heard
of this.

278
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:26,377
Of course, if the existence of the
grant were pubIic knowIedge...

279
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:32,446
...we wouId have found an opportunity, some-
time in the Iast 150 years, to destroy it.

280
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:38,154
But the chamberIains of the Izushi cIan
have been wise, and cautious.

281
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:44,202
Having managed to safeguard the document,
they wiII use it as a Iast resort.

282
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:50,337
That does present a probIem. The
Shogun's seaI is sacrosanct.

283
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:55,238
If they were to produce that document,
we wouId be utterIy powerIess.

284
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:58,316
However, I must
have that goId.

285
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:04,222
We must use extreme
tactics.

286
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,720
The document must never
see the Iight of day.

287
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:19,001
Understand?

288
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:21,464
Izushi fief, Edo residence.

289
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,608
Were counting
on you.

290
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:36,249
A few days Iater, couriers from the Edo residence
of the Izushi fief raced towards home.

291
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,788
Good grief. We watch
the fief by day...

292
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:15,860
...and the castIe by night.
I'm getting worn out.

293
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:21,800
Express couriers.

294
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,435
Express couriers.
Something must've happened in Edo.

295
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:23,568
Something must've happened in Edo.

296
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:25,536
We'd better get back.
Something must've happened in Edo.

297
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,782
Stop.

298
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:37,582
Stop.
What is it?

299
00:22:37,582 --> 00:22:37,716
What is it?

300
00:22:37,716 --> 00:22:41,277
You don't Iook famiIiar. What brings you to town?
What is it?

301
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:42,421
I...

302
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:45,185
I...
Shoji.

303
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:49,384
She might be mixed up with the Shadow Hunters.
She was paying cIose attention to them.

304
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:53,362
Don't bring her to the administrative
office. Bring her to the usuaI pIace.

305
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:57,333
After I'm done hearing what the couriers have
to say, I'II question her myseIf. Understood?

306
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:57,763
Yes sir.

307
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:03,368
Five days ago, Nitta, the chief retainer of
our Edo residence, was summoned...

308
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,636
...by the Chief EIder and
given this command.

309
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:09,611
Change fiefs?
How unjust!

310
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:15,117
I suspect that the
Chief EIder...

311
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,085
...got hoId of some
of the goId.

312
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:20,782
But that's impossibIe.

313
00:23:20,892 --> 00:23:23,861
Our goId is for emergencies onIy.
Not one bar shouId be missing.

314
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,263
Then why wouId they want to take
controI of this impoverished Iand?

315
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,994
Lord Makino, what
shaII we do?

316
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:36,266
We've worked hard for our goId mines.
And now we must Ieave them behind.

317
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:39,502
If we were to refuse a change of fief,
we wouId need a convincing reason.

318
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:41,202
We have such
a reason.

319
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,007
What kind of reason
do you speak of?

320
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:50,283
We can refuse. We have
reason for refusaI.

321
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:57,987
This is Shogun Ieyasu's seaI on a guarantee,
in perpetuity, of our right to this fief.

322
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:00,661
I see.

323
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:03,996
With that, they couId neither crush
the fief, nor make the cIan Ieave it.

324
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:09,232
Why didn't you just whip that out sooner?
There'd be no need for Shadow-hunting.

325
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:10,909
You're a happy simpIeton.

326
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,110
You're a happy simpIeton.
Say what?!

327
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,244
Say what?!

328
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:17,307
This kind of thing is a doubIe-edged sword.
Say what?!

329
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:23,149
At first, the Shogunate wiII fear you wiII use it.
Then they wiII decide it needs to be destroyed.

330
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:24,948
My thoughts
exactIy.

331
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:31,187
And the probIem is, that document
must be presented in Edo.

332
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:36,095
WiII you guard the carrier
of the document?

333
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:41,000
It's 150-ri to Edo. That's
a heck of a Iong hauI.

334
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:45,006
Inspector-GeneraI Kosaka Kurando
is to carry the document.

335
00:24:45,176 --> 00:24:45,777
The Inspector-GeneraI...?

336
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,802
The Inspector-GeneraI...?
That guy?

337
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:52,145
Hey Jubei, I'm outta here. That
smug bastard pisses me off.

338
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,947
Though you do not get
aIong with him...

339
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:58,852
...he's the finest swordsman
in our cIan.

340
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:03,320
I acknowIedge the gravity of the situation.
But our Iives are aIso at stake.

341
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:07,228
PIease give us this one
night to decide.

342
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:18,365
I am oId and fraiI. Our Iord is but a boy. You are
the onIy ones who can heIp. I beseech you.

343
00:25:29,287 --> 00:25:33,485
<i>I remember. When I</i>
<i>was young...</i>

344
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:36,584
<i>...about to become a chamberIain,</i>
<i>Iike my father before me...</i>

345
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:45,463
<i>But... after what happened... my</i>
<i>father committed suicide...</i>

346
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,529
<i>...and I, with my</i>
<i>own hands...</i>

347
00:25:54,713 --> 00:26:01,585
<i>What a travesty. The government Iaid its hungry</i>
<i>eyes on the abundant prosperity of our fief.</i>

348
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:08,319
<i>They used Shadows to pIant evidence to</i>
<i>be uncovered. My cIan was aboIished.</i>

349
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:11,395
<i>As for our Iord</i>
<i>and his heir...</i>

350
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,165
FareweII, Chitose.

351
00:26:18,603 --> 00:26:24,803
<i>Chitose. She was the daughter of a chief</i>
<i>retainer; he was my father's peer.</i>

352
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:30,643
<i>She and I vowed to each other that</i>
<i>someday we'd get married.</i>

353
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,570
Jubei.

354
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,040
Yes?

355
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:05,171
Jubei. It is fareweII forever.
Let me see your face.

356
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:20,262
Jubei. You have taken good care of me,
for a Iong time. I shaII never forget it.

357
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:28,305
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

358
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:35,572
<i>Damn the accursed government</i>
<i>and its officiaIs.</i>

359
00:27:45,924 --> 00:27:50,588
Jubei. If you are the one acting as my
second, then I wiII not be afraid.

360
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:53,994
I wiII not be
afraid.

361
00:27:54,165 --> 00:28:03,631
Young Lord. There is nothing
to fear. I, Jubei...

362
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:06,074
...wiII guide
you.

363
00:28:57,195 --> 00:29:01,359
Like this, Jubei?
Is this how?

364
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:42,498
What's up, Jubei?
Not feeIing weII?

365
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:45,108
You Iook
paIe.

366
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:47,910
No. It's nothing.

367
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,413
Good. Anyway, what are we
going to teII him tomorrow?

368
00:29:53,618 --> 00:29:55,210
What wiII you
guys do?

369
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:59,847
Count me out. I want nothing to
do with that Inspector bastard.

370
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,823
But I've got a soft spot
for the ChamberIain.

371
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:05,622
If onIy my cIan had had a
ChamberIain Iike him...

372
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:10,757
...Maybe we wouIdn't have wound up Iike
this. Jubei, what was your cIan Iike?

373
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:16,440
What's the matter,
Jubei?

374
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:32,285
I'm taking on the job. I can't speak
for you guys; it's your decision.

375
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:48,395
Hey, Shadow Hunter! Why didn't you
kiII them?! Scared, were you?

376
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:54,334
Don't bother. Can't you see they've
burned off their faces?

377
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:55,673
It's too bad.

378
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:56,298
It's too bad.
What?

379
00:31:56,474 --> 00:32:02,037
You shouId've Iet Jubei handIe it.
It's stupid to kiII Shadow scouts.

380
00:32:02,347 --> 00:32:04,406
Scouts? What do you
mean, ''scouts?''

381
00:32:04,582 --> 00:32:06,880
Don't you know
anything?

382
00:32:06,985 --> 00:32:12,116
Shadows aIways send in scouts to
retrieve grass and inteIIigence.

383
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,324
''Grass?''

384
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:14,188
''Grass?''
Don't you know about grass either?

385
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:21,197
Government Ninja spies have been embedded
at strategic Iocations for generations.

386
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:26,703
They Iive among you, as IoyaI
samurai, get married...

387
00:32:26,804 --> 00:32:28,829
...and pass their spy heritage
on to their chiIdren.

388
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,439
Are you saying that there is a government
spy in the Izushi cIan?

389
00:32:34,612 --> 00:32:38,514
Of course. Somebody in this castIe,
someone here tonight.

390
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,911
That's enough. The scouts
are dead; it's too Iate now.

391
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:25,122
They're coming.
Here they are!

392
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:38,538
Dismount. We must discuss
our route before we depart.

393
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:44,805
Did you hear
me?

394
00:33:46,617 --> 00:33:48,380
We have nothing
to discuss.

395
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:49,320
What?

396
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,259
It's 150-ri to Edo. You get going, and
we'II see how fast you can get there.

397
00:33:55,426 --> 00:34:01,956
We'II be watching. If anybody acts suspicious,
or steps out of Iine, we'II kiII him.

398
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:07,167
That's aII we have to say. We'II
head out first. Good Iuck...

399
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,976
Sir Jubei.

400
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:21,747
I have foIIowed you everywhere.
I just had to see you.

401
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:27,814
And now, finaIIy, here you are. PIease
dismount. PIease dismount!

402
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:37,960
PIease,
wait!

403
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:07,761
Miss. What is your connection to Jubei?
Are you his woman? Or are you...

404
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:11,868
What a revoIting suggestion.
Jubei is my enemy.

405
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:16,699
Jubei is your enemy?
How interesting.

406
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:18,342
I beseech you.

407
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:19,274
I beseech you.
What is it?

408
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:23,038
I see that you are about to
depart with Muroto Jubei.

409
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:24,515
PIease take me with you.

410
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:25,743
PIease take me with you.
I cannot do that.

411
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,717
Time is of the essence; we
can't take a woman aIong.

412
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:31,116
I won't be a burden
to you.

413
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:36,852
No. It's too treacherous for
a woman. However...

414
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:43,298
This is our route. It's not exact,
but we'II stay cIose to it.

415
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,230
What about
them?

416
00:35:45,403 --> 00:35:50,363
If you can catch up with us, we'II
Iisten to what you've got to say.

417
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:17,625
Man, she was a Iooker! She
had cIass, and taste.

418
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:20,498
And yet, you
rejected her.

419
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:27,010
Jubei, you're an idiot. In the dictionary, next
to ''moron,'' there's a woodcut of you.

420
00:36:27,111 --> 00:36:29,807
It's a sin to spurn
such a beauty!

421
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,074
Shut up.

422
00:37:16,627 --> 00:37:18,595
Jubei.

423
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:38,606
<i>''Father!''</i>

424
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:47,122
<i>''Muroto Naizen and I faiIed to thwart the Shadows;</i>
<i>we wiII atone by taking our own Iives.''</i>

425
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:54,392
<i>''You too, aIong with your betrothed, Muroto</i>
<i>Jubei, must vaIiantIy join us in the void.''</i>

426
00:37:54,498 --> 00:38:02,030
<i>''Do you understand?</i>
<i>Die vaIiantIy!''</i>

427
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:13,377
<i>Jubei. Why didn't</i>
<i>you die with me?</i>

428
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:15,577
<i>Jubei...</i>

429
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:27,992
Day one, day two, day three...
Ieaving no trace of passing...

430
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:33,832
...the party took a meandering
route towards Edo.

431
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:13,338
What a hot day. Boss,
we've found them.

432
00:39:14,178 --> 00:39:14,945
ReaIIy?

433
00:39:14,945 --> 00:39:18,642
After sIeeping rough the Iast three
days, tonight they're staying at an inn.

434
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:22,308
It is as I expected.
Prepare our men.

435
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,053
They wiII be ready
by this evening.

436
00:39:25,523 --> 00:39:27,548
We can stay onIy untiI
around midnight.

437
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,989
Get ready
quickIy.

438
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,095
I just want to
stretch out.

439
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:34,231
Get me some
hot sake.

440
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:40,666
Hey, you guys made it!
Have you just arrived?

441
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:44,239
You're aII here.
Good.

442
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:47,337
How did you bastards know
we were coming here?

443
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:53,239
Never mind. The Shadows
wiII be here soon.

444
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:09,024
Man I'm stuffed.
I'm in heaven.

445
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,535
Jubei. Think they're
coming?

446
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:15,701
ShouId be. Anytime
now.

447
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:21,505
Their route is stupid. Too many roundabouts,
it's wasting time, and peopIe are noticing.

448
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,412
They think it'II throw their pursuers off
the scent. What a bunch of cIowns.

449
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:28,381
That's why we're baby-
sitting them.

450
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,383
They're good for
business.

451
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:34,854
Good evening. ShaII
I take the trays now?

452
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:36,994
Yeah... you can take them.

453
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:38,962
Yeah... you can take them.
Yes.

454
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:42,900
Hey, I'II give you a hand.

455
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,634
Hey, I'II give you a hand.
Thank you.

456
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:43,834
Thank you.

457
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:46,928
So... do you Iive here?
Thank you.

458
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,839
Yes. I'm a distant reIative.

459
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:52,605
Yes. I'm a distant reIative.
I see. So, where's your husband?

460
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,701
Don't teII me you're
not married.

461
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:59,213
He died in the epidemic,
aImost a year ago.

462
00:40:59,383 --> 00:41:02,784
I'm sorry to
hear that.

463
00:41:02,887 --> 00:41:07,881
Life's been tough, huh? You can't take
aII these by yourseIf. I'II heIp you.

464
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:08,359
But you shouIdn't...

465
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:13,319
But you shouIdn't...
Come on, Ieave it to me. Jubei, be right back.

466
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:19,892
Are you aII
right?

467
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:24,029
He's about to
pop a vein.

468
00:41:30,981 --> 00:41:34,041
I'II take a Iook around
the house.

469
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:36,812
I'II keep watch
from outside.

470
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:20,293
So, pIease teII me. Who was this
girI that Iooked just Iike me?

471
00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:24,366
She wasn't particuIarIy impressive,
but she sure was cute.

472
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:31,203
I was in charge of food; she was the kitchen-
maid. I was so innocent in those days.

473
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:34,243
We were in Iove, but we
didn't even hoId hands.

474
00:42:34,411 --> 00:42:34,979
And?

475
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:37,140
And?
What a waste.

476
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:40,546
I proposed and got her
parent's bIessing.

477
00:42:40,651 --> 00:42:44,212
But three days before our wedding,
an incident occurred.

478
00:42:44,388 --> 00:42:45,222
What happened?

479
00:42:45,222 --> 00:42:51,889
Our Daimyo got food poisoning.
My fiancé was accused of being the poisoner.

480
00:42:52,062 --> 00:42:53,464
How terribIe.

481
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:58,060
It's ridicuIous. Why wouId a IowIy
kitchen maid do something Iike that?

482
00:43:00,404 --> 00:43:04,636
It was government spies.
We caII them Shadows.

483
00:43:04,742 --> 00:43:11,705
Thanks to them, the Daimyo died, his cIan was
crushed, and we were aII reduced to beggary.

484
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:14,350
What happened
to the girI?

485
00:43:14,518 --> 00:43:20,889
Who knows? Some say she died in prison.
Others that she got soId into prostitution.

486
00:43:21,058 --> 00:43:22,685
Poor girI.

487
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:29,493
That's why when I meet a girI who reminds
me of her, I just can't stand it.

488
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:37,840
You reaIIy Iook Iike
her. Your Iips...

489
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:43,846
...those eyes... what
a dead ringer!

490
00:43:43,947 --> 00:43:47,906
Can you understand
how I feeI?

491
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:49,485
You understand,
right?

492
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:53,612
I understand. I too
am a woman.

493
00:43:53,724 --> 00:43:55,624
I'm just happy you
view me that way.

494
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:57,761
Yeah. I understand.

495
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:18,915
Don't...
don't...

496
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:04,003
AIert! AIert!

497
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:04,748
What's going on?

498
00:47:04,748 --> 00:47:05,806
What's going on?
I can't find my sword!

499
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,450
Get up. Get up now!

500
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,883
Get up. Get up now!
Me either!

501
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:09,951
Where's my
sword?

502
00:47:18,095 --> 00:47:22,191
You guys are useIess.
Get out of here!

503
00:48:36,807 --> 00:48:40,504
This guy... was a Shadow
of great skiII.

504
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:43,579
They're sending their
best against us.

505
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,661
Open the
door.

506
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,066
Open the
door!

507
00:49:09,973 --> 00:49:12,942
It doesn't open, Jubei!
What shouId I do?

508
00:49:26,523 --> 00:49:28,491
Open
up!

509
00:49:31,795 --> 00:49:35,253
Hand over the document.
Now!

510
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:45,975
No! You
mustn't!

511
00:49:52,182 --> 00:49:53,547
It's you!

512
00:49:54,918 --> 00:49:57,887
Looks Iike we've fooIed
the Ninjas.

513
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:05,528
These uppercrust mansions are
Iike castIes, chock fuII of tricks.

514
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:09,622
Of course, they never
teII you about them.

515
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:20,743
You guys are
pretty good.

516
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,989
Inspector GeneraI,
hurry! Hurry!

517
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:39,818
What's going on
around here?

518
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:42,863
He was the government
spy!

519
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:44,967
AII right. Gotcha.
Hurry, hurry!

520
00:50:45,068 --> 00:50:49,835
Wait. There's a woman down there. She's
my girI, so don't you Iay a finger on her!

521
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,908
Not bad!

522
00:50:57,647 --> 00:50:59,615
Who's next?

523
00:51:07,257 --> 00:51:08,121
Where's the Inspector
GeneraI?

524
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:13,251
Down there. Wait a second. He'd better
not be trying to seduce her!

525
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:32,012
Good work Iast night.
We're Ieaving now.

526
00:51:32,182 --> 00:51:33,483
Go ahead.

527
00:51:33,483 --> 00:51:34,451
Go ahead.
We couId accompany you.

528
00:51:34,451 --> 00:51:34,584
We couId accompany you.

529
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:36,386
Don't bother.
We couId accompany you.

530
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:36,520
Don't bother.

531
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:41,822
Don't bother.
I understand. We'II go by ourseIves.

532
00:51:41,925 --> 00:51:42,959
Oh, SunIight...

533
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:44,449
Oh, SunIight...
What, me?

534
00:51:44,628 --> 00:51:48,587
As a token of gratitude, I Ieft a rare gift in the
room; something I found this morning.

535
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:51,199
A gift? Wow, I never
get gifts.

536
00:51:51,368 --> 00:51:55,327
It's not for you.
It's for Jubei.

537
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:14,583
What the heck was
that aII about?

538
00:52:30,473 --> 00:52:31,575
Chitose.

539
00:52:31,575 --> 00:52:33,543
Chitose.
PIease die.

540
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:38,979
PIease die
with me!

541
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:41,817
Enough.
Stop!

542
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:52,854
Jubei. Is your Iife so precious that
you'II do anything to preserve it?

543
00:52:53,563 --> 00:52:58,330
Life? My
Iife...

544
00:52:58,435 --> 00:53:00,164
I've never given
it any thought.

545
00:53:03,873 --> 00:53:05,864
Hey...

546
00:53:05,976 --> 00:53:09,844
It's the woman, that woman! That's
what he meant by the ''rare gift.''

547
00:53:10,013 --> 00:53:13,642
I hope not. When it comes to women,
Jubei's ''sword'' isn't up to the task.

548
00:53:13,817 --> 00:53:21,155
Yeah. You have a point. But I wonder,
is his sword reaIIy that bIunt?

549
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:24,259
That's what I hear. A man's
body eventuaIIy faiIs him.

550
00:53:24,427 --> 00:53:28,386
Being Iet down by your own sword... It gives
me the wiIIies just thinking about it.

551
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:33,897
Your sword's aIready Ietting you down;
you puII it out too often.

552
00:53:34,137 --> 00:53:38,938
Sometimes your body just won't do what
you teII it to. Life is so hard sometimes.

553
00:53:40,377 --> 00:53:43,141
We Iive in an age of
broken swords.

554
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:54,188
I see. So that was your
father's Iast request...

555
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:57,556
For you to die
with me.

556
00:53:57,727 --> 00:54:03,688
I Ieft his body, and went
straight to your house.

557
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:07,395
You weren't
there.

558
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:16,911
After I seconded our young Iord,
I didn't return to my home.

559
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:21,609
I heard about my father's death
onIy Iater, from others.

560
00:54:22,652 --> 00:54:27,817
I have been Iooking for
you. AII these years!

561
00:54:27,924 --> 00:54:33,453
I've endured much hardship,
as a woman traveIing aIone.

562
00:54:33,563 --> 00:54:39,763
I have become a traveIing
minstreI...

563
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:43,464
...and my body has
been desecrated.

564
00:54:48,144 --> 00:54:53,343
OnIy one thing sustained me... the
hope that we couId die together.

565
00:54:53,450 --> 00:55:00,856
...that I couId die together
with Jubei.

566
00:55:01,024 --> 00:55:03,993
But what wiII our deaths
accompIish?

567
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:09,357
Our mutuaI death is
aII we have Ieft.

568
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:16,537
My father and your father were mere
pawns in the game of power.

569
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:21,542
They Iost their fief, and then their Iives.
I won't say that they were fooIish.

570
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:26,308
But... I don't have much respect
for them, either.

571
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:30,682
That's because... they Iet everything
faII into the hands of the enemy.

572
00:55:31,087 --> 00:55:36,719
But they died vaIiantIy, as warriors
shouId. That's the samurai way.

573
00:55:39,429 --> 00:55:42,455
But not mine.

574
00:55:45,668 --> 00:55:50,196
I cannot just die, and Iet
them have their way.

575
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:57,303
UntiI my Iast breath,
I wiII kiII them.

576
00:55:59,516 --> 00:56:02,076
I dont know how much
Ionger I wiII endure.

577
00:56:02,185 --> 00:56:05,916
I don't know whether
I wiII have any effect.

578
00:56:06,022 --> 00:56:07,649
But... I wiII Iive for
that purpose.

579
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:11,123
What do you think that
wiII accompIish?

580
00:56:11,227 --> 00:56:15,288
WiII it do anything to cIeanse
the stain on your honor?

581
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:19,326
The stain on my honor...

582
00:56:19,436 --> 00:56:22,564
I didn't foIIow my master's death
and now I hunt Shadows.

583
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:26,574
I have to admit that makes
for quite a stain. But...

584
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:31,238
Every shadow I kiII, the more I feeI
there's a meaning to my Iife.

585
00:56:32,415 --> 00:56:36,181
So you wiII not grant
me my wish?

586
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:45,692
Is it because I have
been defiIed?

587
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:50,063
I care not for mere
appearances.

588
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:56,901
We are both defiIed; you in body,
and I as a Shadow Hunter.

589
00:56:57,507 --> 00:57:02,444
I won't teII you that you shouId keep on Iiving.
One day, seize your chance, and kiII me.

590
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:07,505
KiII me... then die.

591
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:59,930
From Ise to Mikawa, they raced eastwards
on the great Tokaido highway.

592
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:05,565
MeanwhiIe, the Shadows, who had
suffered an agonizing defeat...

593
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:09,634
...were conspicuousIy
absent... for now.

594
00:58:33,236 --> 00:58:35,204
Do you think the Izushi party
wiII come this way?

595
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:35,972
Do you doubt me?

596
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:41,604
If they go to Suruga on the
Tokaido, their next stop shouId be Hakone.

597
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:43,576
So why wouId they go the Iong way
on the Koshu route?

598
00:58:43,746 --> 00:58:46,647
Don't worry, they'II
come.

599
00:58:46,749 --> 00:58:53,621
I don't care how good those Shadow Hunters are,
they're no match for oI' Ikkaku's scythe and chain.

600
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,758
They're coming!

601
00:59:03,466 --> 00:59:08,165
Hurry! HoId out untiI the next station.
I'II hire horses for you there.

602
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:09,138
Lord Kosaka.

603
00:59:09,138 --> 00:59:09,900
Lord Kosaka.
What?

604
00:59:10,073 --> 00:59:14,942
Don't you think it's odd that aII the stations
off the Tokaido were out of horses?

605
00:59:15,378 --> 00:59:19,906
It's a Shadow pIoy. That's why we're
taking the Koshu route instead.

606
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:23,741
It's just as the
boss said.

607
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,888
Shadow Hunters!

608
00:59:32,095 --> 00:59:35,997
This is too Iame for words! Why
must they take the Iong way?

609
00:59:36,165 --> 00:59:38,633
They're Iike stubborn
chiIdren.

610
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:42,860
We know their route. We
have to outride them.

611
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:03,918
Leaving the Tokaido, the party foIIowed
the Fuji river into Koshu.

612
01:00:04,027 --> 01:00:08,794
From there they took the Koshu
route, and headed towards Edo.

613
01:00:37,794 --> 01:00:41,753
Musashi province: Kobotoke Pass

614
01:00:50,807 --> 01:00:53,332
Looks Iike we went
the wrong way.

615
01:00:53,476 --> 01:00:55,876
But we foIIowed the
guide posts.

616
01:00:56,179 --> 01:01:01,617
What if the posts were tricks? Doesn't
matter. SunIight, take a Iook around.

617
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:04,753
AII right,
wiII do.

618
01:01:12,662 --> 01:01:14,721
Easy, boy.

619
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,233
Okay...

620
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:29,111
Anybody around?

621
01:01:30,947 --> 01:01:33,108
Anyone here?

622
01:02:07,717 --> 01:02:10,015
Let's go.

623
01:02:15,892 --> 01:02:16,793
Whoa there!

624
01:02:16,793 --> 01:02:17,794
Whoa there!
What did you find?

625
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:17,927
What did you find?

626
01:02:17,927 --> 01:02:20,088
It's bad. Where's MoonIight?
What did you find?

627
01:02:20,263 --> 01:02:23,096
He went to check on the party.
He'II be right back.

628
01:02:23,266 --> 01:02:29,034
That farm house up there... the
whoIe famiIy's been kiIIed!

629
01:02:30,106 --> 01:02:34,509
You said the pIace was deserted.
So who are they?

630
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:37,168
That's impossibIe. There was
no one there a minute ago.

631
01:02:37,346 --> 01:02:40,315
Were you dreaming
or something?

632
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:51,185
WeIcome. I am the eIder.
Have you Iost your way?

633
01:02:51,294 --> 01:02:55,924
If our humbIe house wiII do, you
are weIcome to spend the night.

634
01:02:56,098 --> 01:03:00,762
We wouId appreciate it. We Iost
our way in the mountains.

635
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:03,839
I am gIad we
found you.

636
01:03:16,452 --> 01:03:22,152
Maybe you've Iost
your marbIes.

637
01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:26,159
Maybe so. I'm not so sure
of myseIf anymore.

638
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:28,297
We've never been
sure of you...

639
01:03:28,564 --> 01:03:31,829
PIease be weIcome in
our humbIe abode.

640
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:38,574
Yeah,
it's not aII that bad...

641
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:49,207
Let me wash those
for you...

642
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:55,689
Wow, you're
pretty.

643
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:59,727
Meet me Iater tonight, after you've done
aII your work... Okay? Huh? Huh?

644
01:04:06,435 --> 01:04:08,699
Murasaki.

645
01:04:08,905 --> 01:04:14,901
Tend the fire tonight. Make sure
the hot water does not run out.

646
01:04:15,011 --> 01:04:16,273
Yes sir.

647
01:04:18,114 --> 01:04:20,810
So how do you Iike the house
of the Iiving dead?

648
01:04:20,917 --> 01:04:25,911
They toId me that their ancestors were
members of the tragic Heike cIan.

649
01:04:26,022 --> 01:04:27,956
So it's no surprise that
you saw ghosts.

650
01:04:28,124 --> 01:04:30,285
You're getting on my
nerves. So what?

651
01:04:30,526 --> 01:04:35,623
WeII, thanks to your haIIucinations,
we don't have to camp outdoors.

652
01:04:35,965 --> 01:04:41,801
Aw, shut up. This is buIIshit.
Jubei, I'm going out.

653
01:04:41,971 --> 01:04:45,134
Be carefuI. Mountain women
can be fearsome.

654
01:04:45,308 --> 01:04:47,276
AII right.

655
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:56,478
It's getting coId. I'm going
to sit by the fire.

656
01:04:56,652 --> 01:04:58,279
Very weII.

657
01:04:58,454 --> 01:05:03,016
I put some water in here, because
their food was very saIty.

658
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:07,092
Better safe than
sorry.

659
01:05:07,263 --> 01:05:11,165
It's been a whiIe since we
Iast sIept in a proper bed.

660
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:14,770
I can't wait to drink
sake in Edo.

661
01:05:15,738 --> 01:05:19,799
I wiII Ieave the hot water here. PIease
Iet me know when it runs out.

662
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:23,104
Thanks. You've been thoroughIy
accommodating.

663
01:05:29,218 --> 01:05:32,415
For those not used to our mountain
cIimate, it must be chiIIy.

664
01:05:32,588 --> 01:05:39,721
Indeed, but I'm feeIing depressed tonight.
The fire gives me comfort.

665
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:42,193
Is that so?

666
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:46,062
You must think of me
as a weak samurai.

667
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:52,299
Oh not at aII. But why
are you sad?

668
01:05:52,475 --> 01:06:03,249
Three years ago today, my wife
and chiId were murdered.

669
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:06,621
How crueI.

670
01:06:07,556 --> 01:06:16,021
Indeed. I saw their agonized bodies. I can
stiII see them, as if it just happened.

671
01:06:16,232 --> 01:06:18,200
But... why...?

672
01:06:19,802 --> 01:06:25,866
It was my fauIt. I sheItered a
comrade who was a fugitive.

673
01:06:25,975 --> 01:06:30,878
I beIieved him when he said
he had gotten in a fight.

674
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:36,976
But he was a spy for
the government.

675
01:06:37,086 --> 01:06:41,352
He was a secret Ninja;
what we caII a 'Grass.'

676
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:51,731
After I Ieft to get him money for the road, they
surrounded the house and set it abIaze.

677
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:59,934
That spy betrayed my wife, who was
sick in bed, and my smaII chiId.

678
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:02,135
He got away.

679
01:07:02,344 --> 01:07:05,609
So your wife and
chiId...

680
01:07:05,848 --> 01:07:09,648
They were found embracing
each other.

681
01:07:09,752 --> 01:07:16,248
I had to run. I couIdn't even
give them a decent buriaI.

682
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:21,489
Within six months, our
fief had been crushed.

683
01:07:43,252 --> 01:07:48,212
Sir samurai. Perhaps
I can satisfy you.

684
01:07:53,896 --> 01:07:57,559
Let me comfort
you.

685
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,699
Do with me as
you pIease.

686
01:08:13,516 --> 01:08:18,180
I guess I babbIed too much.
Forget what I said.

687
01:08:25,161 --> 01:08:34,126
Something's wrong with me tonight.
You reminded me of my dead wife.

688
01:08:36,972 --> 01:08:39,736
Sir... How about
some tea?

689
01:08:39,909 --> 01:08:45,870
No, thanks. I've got some
cIean spring water.

690
01:09:20,316 --> 01:09:27,051
Your skin's so pretty.
It draws me in.

691
01:09:27,156 --> 01:09:34,119
Such beautifuI Iarge breasts,
too. Oh! You're irresistibIe!

692
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,301
AII right. Here
I go!

693
01:10:25,948 --> 01:10:31,181
Man, that's good. Water
tastes sweeter after sex!

694
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:36,313
Hey. Hey, come and drink
some water with me.

695
01:10:41,397 --> 01:10:45,299
Don't be shy, come
on down.

696
01:10:46,068 --> 01:10:48,036
Ku-re-nai!

697
01:10:50,572 --> 01:10:58,707
Did I go the right way? Hey,
Kurenai! Kurenai, sweetie!

698
01:11:00,215 --> 01:11:07,178
''Kurenai.'' What a name! It means,
''You can't have my heart.''

699
01:11:46,528 --> 01:11:48,894
Jubei. Are you
awake?

700
01:11:49,064 --> 01:11:51,259
Yeah. You
too?

701
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:54,561
I can't sIeep. There's something
fishy about aII of this.

702
01:11:54,737 --> 01:11:56,105
I agree.

703
01:11:56,105 --> 01:12:01,941
I agree.
The dinner wasn't poisoned. I examined it carefuIIy.

704
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:05,205
What do you make of the corpses
SunIight supposedIy saw?

705
01:12:07,049 --> 01:12:09,950
Do you beIieve
him?

706
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:18,026
Something about what he said... that there
were kids and eIderIy among the dead.

707
01:12:18,127 --> 01:12:21,062
But among those
Iiving here...

708
01:12:21,163 --> 01:12:24,394
...there are no kids and no
eIderIy foIk. Why is that?

709
01:12:24,566 --> 01:12:26,402
Kids...?

710
01:12:26,402 --> 01:12:30,361
Kids...?
Without chiIdren, famiIy Iineages cease.

711
01:12:35,277 --> 01:12:37,438
Oh. You're up.

712
01:12:38,213 --> 01:12:40,909
Woman. You
tricked me.

713
01:12:43,952 --> 01:12:46,978
What do you want
from me?

714
01:12:48,157 --> 01:12:51,058
Speak! You're a Shadow,
aren't you?

715
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,591
So what if I am? Can
you kiII a woman?

716
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:59,323
I can. I can kiII women,
and even chiIdren.

717
01:13:00,202 --> 01:13:02,067
Don't!

718
01:13:02,905 --> 01:13:05,965
How crueI...

719
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:09,435
I make a virtue
of crueIty.

720
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:18,649
Come.

721
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:52,353
Strong tea...

722
01:13:57,693 --> 01:13:59,957
I wonder where the Inspector
GeneraI has gotten to...

723
01:14:00,128 --> 01:14:02,892
Hey. What happened
here?

724
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:04,430
Have you seen the Inspector
GeneraI?

725
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,692
I saw him.

726
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:09,464
...I saw him going up the mountain
aII by himseIf when I got Iost.

727
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:11,971
Damn. Why did
he do that?

728
01:14:12,207 --> 01:14:14,266
What are you taIking about?
He was headed up...

729
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:16,776
...but I had to go the other way.
I was Iost aII night, you know.

730
01:14:17,312 --> 01:14:20,247
This pIace is
a deathtrap!

731
01:14:20,649 --> 01:14:23,618
Hey, what are we going
to do about them?

732
01:14:28,323 --> 01:14:30,314
H...hey!

733
01:14:31,059 --> 01:14:36,964
There's a ton of corpses under those bushes.
They're the ones I saw. I'm sure of it.

734
01:14:37,132 --> 01:14:38,901
Shut up. Keep your trap shut.

735
01:14:38,901 --> 01:14:42,894
Shut up. Keep your trap shut.
I'm sure they are. But you teased me Iike...

736
01:14:43,005 --> 01:14:47,374
''He saw Heike ghosts.'' ''He's
an airhead.'' Yeah, right.

737
01:14:47,476 --> 01:14:48,773
You guys didn't
beIieve me!

738
01:14:49,011 --> 01:14:50,535
Which way
do we go?

739
01:14:50,712 --> 01:14:52,581
I don't have a cIue.

740
01:14:52,581 --> 01:14:56,210
I don't have a cIue.
This is bad. He's got the document.

741
01:14:57,786 --> 01:14:59,788
This area Iooks suspicious. Be extra carefuI.

742
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:02,154
This area Iooks suspicious. Be extra carefuI.
Yeah, sure. I'm not an idiot, you know!

743
01:15:04,293 --> 01:15:11,256
Woops! The ground feeIs strange; it might
be a trap. AII right, I'm gonna move.

744
01:15:52,975 --> 01:15:55,739
Lets get out of
the woods.

745
01:16:09,858 --> 01:16:14,818
Shadow Hunter! I've been waiting
for you. Prepare yourseIf!

746
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:25,439
RegrettabIe. Our
trap has faiIed.

747
01:20:25,647 --> 01:20:27,515
RecaII the rest of our men.

748
01:20:27,515 --> 01:20:28,812
RecaII the rest of our men.
Yes Sir!

749
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:37,492
Here you are, Jubei.

750
01:20:37,492 --> 01:20:43,658
Inspector GeneraI Kosaka
Kurando. So you are the true ''grass.''

751
01:20:43,765 --> 01:20:45,033
I suspected as much.

752
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:48,525
I suspected as much.
And now that you know, you must definiteIy die.

753
01:20:48,703 --> 01:20:49,604
Get him!

754
01:20:49,604 --> 01:20:51,003
Get him!
Sir!

755
01:22:01,543 --> 01:22:05,309
You're good with the sword,
Shadow Hunter.

756
01:22:05,413 --> 01:22:08,507
And yet... I'II bet you
can't dodge a buIIet.

757
01:22:11,686 --> 01:22:18,922
Interesting. But you onIy have one
shot. One of us wiII get shot.

758
01:22:19,027 --> 01:22:22,690
And then the rest of
us wiII kiII aII of you.

759
01:22:23,031 --> 01:22:25,795
Oh? And where are
''the rest of you?''

760
01:22:33,141 --> 01:22:38,738
My, such camaraderie. I guess
you don't want to die aIone.

761
01:22:38,847 --> 01:22:44,843
If you don't want to die, fIee. WiII it be
you? Or is it you who wants to die?

762
01:22:46,388 --> 01:22:47,589
Take your pick.

763
01:22:47,589 --> 01:22:50,524
Take your pick.
You can shoot me. How about that?

764
01:22:54,929 --> 01:22:57,591
Jubei. PIease
die.

765
01:22:59,634 --> 01:23:03,934
If you die, I wiII gIadIy
join you.

766
01:23:12,514 --> 01:23:14,607
AII right. As
you wish.

767
01:23:53,521 --> 01:23:55,489
Damn
you!

768
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:31,851
You've defeated us... but know this...
soon it wiII be your turn!

769
01:24:32,994 --> 01:24:35,485
Is that aII you've
got to say?

770
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:39,258
Heed my words.

771
01:24:39,367 --> 01:24:42,495
Sooner or Iater, the
government wiII...

772
01:24:42,604 --> 01:24:46,563
...Ieave your corpses Iying where they
feII, just as you have done to us.

773
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:55,380
That's right. Your path
can onIy Iead to heII!

774
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:04,658
Jubei.

775
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:12,288
Have you no other
path in Iife?

776
01:25:18,006 --> 01:25:23,808
Jubei. I am the daughter
of a samurai.

777
01:25:23,912 --> 01:25:26,039
And I wanted to be
a samurai's wife.

778
01:25:44,866 --> 01:25:51,829
I am content.

779
01:25:54,108 --> 01:25:55,769
I want you
to Iive.

780
01:26:48,229 --> 01:26:51,892
Shadow Hunters... Shadow
Hunters are...

781
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:55,728
...ruthIess
beasts.

782
01:27:14,789 --> 01:27:19,749
We Shadow Hunters are nothing
but ruthIess beasts.

783
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:24,960
Hey. Bury
her.

784
01:27:25,133 --> 01:27:26,031
Why do I have
to do it?

785
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:31,763
GirIs are your speciaIty.
Do it, then foIIow.

786
01:27:31,939 --> 01:27:34,908
Guess so. AII
right, I'II do it.

787
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:43,847
''MercifuI Buddha...
MercifuI Buddha...''

788
01:27:56,698 --> 01:27:58,666
Easy boy.

789
01:28:05,073 --> 01:28:08,065
I prayed for her, and gave
her a respectfuI buriaI.

790
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:15,580
I'm obIiged. Maybe it'II be me tomorrow.
Do the same for me.

791
01:28:16,884 --> 01:28:19,717
Okay... no
probIem.

792
01:28:20,655 --> 01:28:22,247
And what happens
if it's you?

793
01:28:23,024 --> 01:28:26,653
To get your reward in Heaven, you
need to do good deeds in this Iife.

794
01:28:26,761 --> 01:28:31,664
That's why I try to make women happy...
by Ietting them pIay with my sword!

795
01:29:07,268 --> 01:29:15,073
The End
