[Clearing Throat]
What is it, Latham?

4
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,894
It's nearly 10:00,
Inspector. I have
a carriage waiting.

5
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:35,567
Carriage? What carriage?
You wanted to look
at that place in the park.

6
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:39,669
Don't you recall, sir?
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.

7
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:43,273
Confounded nuisance,
spending one's time
on routine investigations.

8
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,012
I'd hardly call
this routine, sir.

9
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:48,611
What would
you call it?
Why, l-l...

10
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,679
I'd say it was
highly unusual...

11
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:53,885
a man being attacked
by a werewolf
in a London park.

12
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,292
Werewolf?

13
00:01:56,363 --> 00:02:00,459
I'm surprised at you, Latham.
I always looked upon you
as an intelligent man.

14
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,832
Where on earth did you
get this "werewolf" idea?

15
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:06,839
I know, you've been
looking at the papers.
Well, they are full of it.

16
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:11,105
Bosh! From what I understand
of the case, the man
was nipped by a stray dog.

17
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:14,614
Oh, it was much worse
than that, sir. He was
very badly slashed.

18
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,650
He swears that
it was not an animal
that attacked him.

19
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:20,379
I suppose he was
accosted by a man...

20
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:23,446
who suddenly
sprouted hairy ears
and long fangs.

21
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,787
No, sir.
No ears, and no fangs.

22
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:29,693
As a matter of fact,
it wasn't a man.
It was a woman.

23
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:32,698
A little early
to be visiting
grog shops, isn't it?

24
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:36,532
Oh, sir, I never
touch a drop...
before 6:00 in the evening.

25
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:39,671
Come along.
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:49,038
Fine morning,
isn't it?
Much <i>too</i> fine...

27
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:52,141
to be wasting it
on minor things
like stray dogs.

28
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,993
Well, Miss Allenby,
are you prepared to
accept defeat gracefully?

29
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:06,396
You haven't defeated me
yet, Mr. Lanfield.
[Chuckles]

30
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,094
We are certainly formal
this morning, aren't we,
Phyllis?
[Chuckles]

31
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:13,970
Yes, we are.
Much too formal for two people
who are to be married next week.

32
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,009
Next December.
Next week.

33
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:19,045
This race is
merely a formality.

34
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:21,979
You sure you don't want
the handicap I offered you?
No, thank you.

35
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:25,711
All right.
Do you mind if I review
the terms of the race?

36
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:29,482
Just to refresh your memory.
As a lawyer, I don't want
any loopholes.

37
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:31,490
I'll save you
the trouble, sir.

38
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:35,153
"We race to the road
in the glen, and the winner
names our wedding day."

39
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:38,197
Which will be
next December, because
I'm going to win!

40
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:41,234
And I adore
winter weddings.
And I detest them.

41
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:43,735
That's why
I'm going to win.
You ready?

42
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:46,294
Ready.
Start counting.

43
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,206
One, two, three...
go!

44
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:19,467
Well, Miss Allenby,
I won fairly and squarely,

45
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,633
and next week you'll
become Mrs. Barry Lanfield.

46
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,007
You should have taken
that five-length handicap
I offered you.

47
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:27,876
I'm glad I didn't,
Barry. You see, l...

48
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:31,179
I didn't really
want to wait
till next December.

49
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:33,242
You didn't?

50
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,585
<i>[Latham] Aha. You see?</i>
<i>They're woman's footprints,</i>
<i>Inspector. There's no doubt.</i>

51
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:43,527
She came along the meadow,
and probably went through
this hedge.

52
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,758
You know, that fellow
might have been
telling the truth...

53
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,959
about a female werewolf
attacking him.

54
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:51,333
<i>[Inspector]</i>
<i>Stop that nonsense about</i>
<i>a werewolf attacking anybody.</i>

55
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:53,372
I'm sorry, Inspector.
Is there a way we can
get through this brush?

56
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,432
<i>[Man] Here's a spot, sir.</i>
All right, we'll have
a look on the other side.

57
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:59,945
[Latham]
Yes, well, let me help
you, sir. Thank you.

58
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,878
What's the
matter, Phyllis?

59
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:06,476
You look frightened.
Oh, why... those
voices startled me.

60
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:12,280
Shall we go?
Yes, now that we have an
audience, the spell is broken.

61
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,658
We seem to have interrupted
a romantic moment.
Mm.

62
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:21,463
You know, when I was
courtin' my missus, we used
to go horseback ridin'.

63
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,661
Did you?
Yeah.
Then we got married,

64
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:26,399
and she refused
to go near a horse
from that moment on.

65
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:29,931
She only pretended
to like riding until
she got me well-hooked.

66
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,103
When you're quite
finished mooning about
your courting days,

67
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:35,170
perhaps we can get on
with the business in hand.
I'm sorry, Inspector.

68
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,375
Uh, come on.

69
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:42,179
You look very thoughtful.

70
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,689
I have many things
on my mind.

71
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:47,852
After all, I'm to be
a bride next week.

72
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,327
That's not
what's troubling you.

73
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,855
Are you upset because of what
the constables were saying?

74
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,959
Frankly, I am.
It's not a very
comfortable feeling,

75
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:59,062
to know that such
weird things
are taking place...

76
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,733
in the park so close
to where one lives.

77
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:06,677
[Chuckles] But certainly you
don't believe those newspaper
stories about werewolves?

78
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:11,274
That's just sensational trash,
the sort of thing one reads
in penny dreadfuls...

79
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:13,512
if one reads
penny dreadfuls.

80
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:16,316
You don't read them,
do you?
Oh, of course not.

81
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,257
It's just that l...
I guess I'm on edge,
because...

82
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:22,794
Well, there's no man
in our house.

83
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:26,059
Your worries will be over
next week, when you move
into my diggings.

84
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:29,795
In the meantime,
I don't think you'll be
roaming the park at nights.

85
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,702
Not if I can help it.

86
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,645
[Growling]

87
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:59,888
[Loud Barking]

88
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,972
Oh, Hannah.
Yes, Miss Carol.

89
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,271
Will you do something
for me while you're
doing the marketing?

90
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:13,278
Of course, miss.
You want me
to fetch something?

91
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,747
No, I want you to
deliver something.

92
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:19,478
Please leave this at
the chemist on the corner
near the greengrocer.

93
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:22,146
Just say that someone
will call for it
this afternoon.

94
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:26,921
Will you do that?
Oh, ho! So it's Cupid
I'm playing this fine morning!

95
00:07:26,993 --> 00:07:29,928
<i>[Laughing]</i>
<i>Yes. And the note</i>
<i>is very important.</i>

96
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:32,931
<i>They always are</i>
<i>at your age.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

97
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,765
Don't fret. I'll see that
it's delivered quickly.
Thank you very much, Hannah.

98
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,796
<i>Hannah.!</i>
Yes, Mrs. Winthrop?

99
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:43,809
L-Is there something else
you've thought of for me
to bring from the market?

100
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:47,506
No. I'll take that note
Carol handed to you.

101
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,845
Note? What note?
Quickly. I saw you
put it in your basket.

102
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:53,784
<i>But, mother,</i>
<i>it's only a</i>...
I'll see what it is.

103
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:57,118
Give it to me
before I lose patience
and discharge you.

104
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:02,993
I'm sorry, Miss Carol.
Run along and
do your marketing.

105
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,996
Hmmph!

106
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,801
I thought so.
Mother, you've
no right to...

107
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:11,860
To keep you from making
a fool of yourself...

108
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:14,372
over a worthless fellow
like Dwight Severn?

109
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,000
Is that what
you were about to say?
I love Dwight.

110
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:20,534
And he's not worthless.
He's fine and sweet
and considerate and...

111
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:23,047
And hasn't a penny
to his name.

112
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:25,448
Come in the house, Carol.
I want to talk to you.

113
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,140
[Banging]

114
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,144
Sit down.

115
00:08:55,748 --> 00:09:00,412
I'm certain you imagine
yourself madly in love with this
starving young artist of yours.

116
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,716
But have you given any thought
to what happens to us...

117
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:05,849
the moment Phyllis
marries Barry Lanfield?

118
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:09,053
I imagine
things will go on
pretty much the same.

119
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:14,156
Of course, we'll miss her.
It's not as simple
as that, Carol.

120
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:16,964
That's why I'm delving
into the past now,

121
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:20,597
to tell you of certain
things I probably should have
explained to you long ago.

122
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:24,074
The reason
I haven't told you is...

123
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:28,580
that your happiness
has always been
uppermost in my mind.

124
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:32,948
First, I think
you should know...
you're not Phyllis's cousin.

125
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,546
You're not related
to her in any way.

126
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:39,854
I don't understand.
You're her aunt, and...

127
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:44,454
No. I'm not related
to her, either.

128
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,331
I'm only the woman
who might have married
Reginald Allenby.

129
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:55,136
Reginald Allenby?
Phyllis's father?
Yes.

130
00:09:55,208 --> 00:10:00,441
This is the note
he sent me the day before
I married your father.

131
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,708
Read it.

132
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:10,220
"My own darling,
I know that nothing I can
say will change your mind.

133
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,259
"I wish you every
happiness, even though
my heart tells me...

134
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:16,022
"I shall never quite
get over loving you,

135
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:19,462
Reggie."
Of course,
he did get over it.

136
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:22,558
Disappointed suitors
generally do.

137
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:27,197
He married Phyllis's mother
just one year after
I married your father...

138
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:30,868
a man as penniless as
the precious young man
you wish to marry.

139
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:36,177
And when your father died,
leaving me with a small child
and practically no money,

140
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,547
I had to fend for myself.

141
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,712
That's how I happened
to become the housekeeper...

142
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:44,848
of the Allenby's

I'd feel unclean.

Psst! Hannah.
Oh! What're you doin'
here, Mr. Barry?

292
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:51,669
Not so loud. Go on with
your work. I want to
ask you some questions.

293
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:54,406
How's Phyllis
this morning?
She seems
much better, sir.

294
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,506

She's in the garden now.
Gettin' some sun.

295
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,517
That's strange.

296
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:01,450
Mrs. Winthrop
told me she was
too ill to see me.

297
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,954
She's been
telling me that
for two days now.

298
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:06,354
Mrs. Winthrop is peculiar,
if you ask me.

299
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,518
Only don't tell her
I said so.

300
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:10,994
I won't, if you'll
let me go through
here to the garden.

301
00:24:11,063 --> 00:24:13,054
Go ahead!
What's holdin' ya?

302
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,566
[Whispering]
And if ya get caught, I'll
swear I never set eyes on ya.

303

Barry!

How did you get here?
I'll tell you
about that later.

307
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:30,715
First, I want
to talk to you.

Barry, please.
I can't talk about it now.

313
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:58,039
Phyllis,
what's the matter?
It's Barry.

314
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,044
Will you please
ask him to go?

315
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,749
Barry, I didn't know
you were here.

316
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,751
Where did Phyllis go?
I've got to talk to her.

317
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:09,515
You'd better not.
You've upset her
enough already.

318
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:11,681
How could I have upset
her? I merely walked
into the garden...

319
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,691
and asked her why
she's been avoiding me.

320
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,922
Perhaps she's been avoiding you
because she didn't want you
to see her while she was ill.

321
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:21,455
She's a sensitive girl.
Don't force the issue when
she's feeling as she does now.

322
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:24,525
What's wrong with her,
Mrs. Winthrop?
What's come over her?

323
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:27,333
You'd think a girl
about to be married
would be in great spirits.

324
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:30,705
It's just a case of nerves.
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

325
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:33,904
In a couple of days,
when she's feeling better,
she'll be a different person.

326
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:36,846
In the meantime,
I'll take good care of her.

Uh, how many people
live in this house?

343
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:21,641
Four. Mrs. Winthrop,
her daughter, her niece
and meself.

344
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,314
No men?
Not a man.

345
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:27,017
Mm.
Are there any dogs
about the place?

Yes, indeed!
And vicious beasts
they are.

00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:32,122
Every night
they keep me awake with
their barkin' and howlin'.

348
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,461
You'd be doin' me
a great favor
if you'd take them away.

349
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:36,467
That's what
you'd be doin'.
Mm.

350

It's a gentleman

Latham is

How do you do?

352
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:47,510
I'm Mrs. Winthrop.
That will be all,
Hannah.

353
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,513
I presume all dogs
are under suspicion,

354
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:52,072

357
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,553
I imagine that you keep
them for protection.

358

I can't say that
I blame you, with no men
about the place.

I don't suppose you allow
the dogs to roam at large?

360
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:07,364
Certainly not.
They're locked in the garden
most of the time.

361
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:10,060
Especially at night.
Mm.

362
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:14,731
Have you noticed
any suspicious characters
about the place?

363
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,740
No, I haven't.
Uh, tell me,

364
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:20,005
have the police any clue
as to who murdered
that boy in the park?

365
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:22,740
Well, not exactly a clue,
as you might say.

366
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:25,544
Of course,
we've narrowed it down
to where we feel certain...

367
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,676
that it's an animal
from this neighborhood.

368
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:30,221
Or a person.
A person?

369
00:28:30,288 --> 00:28:35,453
Mm.
My own theory, Mrs. Winthrop,
is that it's a were...

370
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:39,224
[Clears Throat]
That a madman or a woman
is responsible.

checking all the houses

notify the police
at once, won't you?

There are
no such things.
Mm.

435

Well, the Inspector
thinks that, too.

No, sir.
Everything is

of a few dogs howling.

to howl tomorrow night.

00:35:14,692 --> 00:35:16,626
I suppose that you're still
of the opinion that when...

443
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:19,629
the park is
cleared of the dogs,
the attacks will stop.

Oh, certainly, sir.
Aren't you?

I'm not so sure.
Well, um, see you later.

Well, there's a barmy one.

there's a werewolf

You must be joking.
She's much too ill

Cheer up, sobersides.

It's good for ya
to get away from that house.

520
00:41:59,163 --> 00:42:01,791
I wonder why your Aunt Martha
was so insistent
I couldn't see you.

521

Aunt Martha was acting
for my own good,

To protect you?
From what?

00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,881
I want you to tell me
what it is.

526
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,477
It isn't anything so serious
we can't overcome it together.

527
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:25,613
After all, we are
going to be married.

528
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,989
We can't be
married, Barry. Ever.

529
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:34,020
Why not?
L-I can't
tell you that.

530
00:42:34,098 --> 00:42:36,692

I think I understand.

532
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,739
You're not going to let me in
for the curse of the Allenbys
and all that sort of thing.

533
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:45,537
Is that it?
How did you know?

534
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,170
Carol mentioned
your being so frightened
of howling dogs of late,

535
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,737
and I merely
added up the facts.

536
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:54,751
Please, let's not
talk about it anymore.
We've got to talk about it.

537
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:58,220
You can't let yourself
go to pieces
over a thing like that.

538
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:00,757
I'm sure you place no stock
in that silly legend...

539
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:03,123
about your family
being cursed by the wolves.

540
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:06,129
I'm not sure.

541
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:08,631
I know you scoff
at the Allenby curse,

542
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:12,260
but ever since
my parents were killed,

543
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:15,203
I've had
the strangest dreams,

544
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:19,107
dreams in which it seemed
I lived a long time ago.

545
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:23,044
I took part
in pagan rites.

546
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:25,912
I assumed
the form of a wolf.

547
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:27,917
I even hunted
with the wolves.

548
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:30,249
Those dreams
are easily explained.

549
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:33,085
Someone probably
told you weird stories
about the Allenby curse...

550
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:35,148
when you were a child.

551
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:37,160
Certainly, you don't believe
in werewolves, do you?

552
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:39,696
Many people do.

553
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:43,564
There was an ancient tribe,
the Hirpini,
which worshipped wolves.

554
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:45,795
But that was
centuries ago.
Yes.

555
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:49,431
But even today
in Scotland, on the nights
when the dogs howl,

556
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,738
people hang out
lighted lanterns
to ward off evil spirits.

557
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,472
You've been reading up
on the subject,
haven't you?

558
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:57,673
Yes, I have.

559
00:43:57,748 --> 00:44:00,478
Plato and Pythagoras
on the transmigration
of souls,

560
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:02,644
I suppose.
Yes.

561

for being in the park.

581
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,878
Furthermore, if anyone
tries to avoid questioning
by running away,

582
00:45:10,955 --> 00:45:14,447
you are to shoot
after a single command
to halt.

583
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:17,619
You've been provided
with firearms
for this emergency.

584
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,686
We'll start patrolling
at once.

585
00:45:19,764 --> 00:45:22,130
All right, men.
To your posts.

586
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,660
I think I'll take a turn
in the park myself,
Constable.

587
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,728
Very good, sir.
All right.

588
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,296
<i>Good evening.</i>
Hold on, sir.

589
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:10,772
What are you doing
in the park at this hour?

590
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:13,366
Frankly,
I'm doing a little
private investigating.

591
00:47:13,444 --> 00:47:16,777
Planning to capture
the she-wolf single-handed,
I presume.

592
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:20,442
Something like that.
These weird stories
in the newspapers fascinate me.

593
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:23,453
I'll have to trouble you
for your name.

594
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:26,012
My name is
Barry Lanfield.
Your occupation?

595
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,025
I'm a barrister
in partnership
with my father.

596
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:32,893
Not Sir Sidney Lanfield?
Yes.

597
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:35,625
Any credentials
to prove it?
Certainly.

Well,
what's happened, sir?

602
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:32,951
L... I was sitting
on that bench,

603
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,321
and this woman...
or whatever it was...

604
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:38,793
howled and...
and grabbed me
by the throat.

605
00:48:38,862 --> 00:48:41,092
There!
There she is now.

606

<i>After her, men.</i>
<i>After her.!</i>

607
00:48:45,102 --> 00:48:47,036
Did you get a look
at her face?

608
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:49,629
No,
l-I was much too busy
protecting myself.

609
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:51,732
She seemed
terribly strong
for a woman.

610
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:56,910
Dwight,
what happened?

611
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:59,472
I was waiting for you
to show up,
when this wolf-woman...

612
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,212
evidently decided
to make me
her next victim.

613
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:04,379
You poor darling.
Are you badly hurt?

614
00:49:04,455 --> 00:49:06,685
Pretty badly mussed up,
but nothing serious.

615
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:08,691
Barry!

616
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:11,660
Hello, Carol.
What are you
doing here?

617
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:14,095
I might ask you
the same question.

618
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:16,098
Dwight just
answered that.

619
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,100
I came here
to meet him.

620
00:49:18,168 --> 00:49:21,160
Dwight, this is
Barry Lanfield.
Barry, Dwight Severn.

621
00:49:21,238 --> 00:49:23,172
How do you do?
Hello.

622
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,108
Just to make things cozy,
I'm Constable Ernie 'Obbs.

623
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:29,111
Now that we all know
each other,

624
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:33,013
suppose we go to park patrol
headquarters and get acquainted
with the inspector.

625
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:35,916
He might 'ave
a few questions
to ask too.

626
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:38,011
Come on, now.

627
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:52,335
<i>[Knocking]</i>

628
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:01,811
Good evening, Barry.
Good evening.

629
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:04,211
Come in.

630
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,579
I'll run upstairs and see
if Phyllis is able to see you.

631
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,086
Later.
First I'd like to
ask you some questions.

632
00:50:10,154 --> 00:50:12,384
My, you sound serious.

633
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:15,289
I am. Shall we go
into the library?

634
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,293
Certainly.

635
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:23,332
You may cross-examine me,
Barrister,

636
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,630
but do you mind
if I sit down
while you're doing it?

637
00:50:25,703 --> 00:50:28,536
I think much better
when I'm sitting down.

638
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:31,733
What I'm going to ask you
will require a bit of thinking...

639
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,743
quick thinking.

640
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:40,445
Did you know that I saw you
leave the house last night
and followed you to the park?

641
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:43,486
So that's how you happened to
be there when I met Dwight.
Yes.

642
00:50:43,554 --> 00:50:46,990
And that's also how
I happened to discover
that you were the she-wolf.

643
00:50:47,057 --> 00:50:51,517
- Barry, you must be joking.
- No, I'm quite serious.

644
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:55,622
You can't possibly
be serious, Barry.
<i>But I am.</i>

645
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:58,634
Of course, you may not recall
everything you did.

646
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:01,569
<i>Insane people seldom do</i>
<i>when under stress.</i>

647
00:51:01,638 --> 00:51:04,607
I'm perfectly sane,
and I was under no stress.

648
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:08,202
I went to the park
for only one reason:
To meet Dwight Severn.

649
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:11,645
<i>I've been meeting him</i>
<i>three nights a week</i>
<i>for the past two months.</i>

650
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:15,515
<i>You're certain you went</i>
<i>directly to the meeting place?</i>
<i>I am certain.</i>

651
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:18,214
Do you mind
if I ask a question?

652
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:20,222
Go ahead.

653
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:22,622
How did you happen
to see me when I left
the house last night?

654
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:24,627
I was worried
about Phyllis.

655
00:51:24,695 --> 00:51:27,755
I decided to watch
the house all night.

656
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:30,561
Something she said
when we were riding yesterday
made me think that...

657
00:51:30,634 --> 00:51:33,797
You suspect that
she might be the she-wolf,
don't you?

658
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:36,939
I did...

659
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:39,942
until I saw you
steal out of the house.

660
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,240
Now I don't know
what to think.

661
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:45,042
Good evening, Barry.
Good evening,
Mrs. Winthrop.

662
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:49,017
Why didn't you let me know Barry
was calling, Carol? I would've
made you a cup of chocolate.

663
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:51,520
I'll make it now.
Please don't bother,
Mrs. Winthrop.

664
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:55,046
I just dropped by
hoping I might see Phyllis.

665
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:57,059
I'm afraid
you can't, Barry.

666
00:51:57,127 --> 00:52:00,927
She's been terribly upset
since you took her riding
yesterday afternoon.

667
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:02,932
I don't know
why it is,

668
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,696
but you seem to be
a disturbing influence.

669
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:08,795
Perhaps she'll feel better
in the morning.
I'll drop around again then.

670
00:52:08,872 --> 00:52:10,840
Good night.

I've been seeing Dwight,

very happy when he

you've decided to make
a bold front of it...

sneaking out to meet
your starving artist.

the police.
The police?
But why?

689
00:54:05,155 --> 00:54:09,023
Phyllis has just told me
the whole story.
What are you talking about?

690
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:12,550
Her belief that she's
a werewolf. She showed me
all the evidence too.

691
00:54:12,629 --> 00:54:16,292
At least you know now
that I was speaking the truth
when I said she's insane.

I don't believe

Yes.

729
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:06,829
You see, if the police came
while you were still alive,

730
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:09,764
they would investigate
the strange story
you would tell them.

731
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,767
They would
call in a doctor,

732
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:13,826
and he would find
that you are perfectly sane.

733
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:17,940
So I'm going to kill you.

734
00:58:18,008 --> 00:58:21,068
But why?

735
00:58:21,144 --> 00:58:24,910
Because I planned all this
to get you out of the way.

736
00:58:24,981 --> 00:58:28,712
<i>When I discovered</i>
<i>you still believed in</i>
<i>the curse of the Allenbys,</i>

737
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:33,088
I decided to
drive you insane.

738
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,150
It would mean
much to me...

739
00:58:37,227 --> 00:58:39,252
and to Carol.

740
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:43,390
For me, it would mean
that I could stay on here
in this house I love...

741
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:46,299
that I managed
for so many years.

742
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:50,465
For Carol, it would mean
that she could marry a man
not beneath her station,

743
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,838
a man like
Barry Lanfield, who...

744
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:57,269
So I began by killing
the little boy in the park,

745
00:58:57,347 --> 00:58:59,941
<i>led you to believe</i>
<i>you did it.</i>

746
00:59:00,016 --> 00:59:01,950
Oh, no.

747
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,389
Later, I killed that...
meddling fool from
Scotland Yard...

748
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:08,856
because he was getting
too close to the truth.

749
00:59:11,962 --> 00:59:14,590
And my plan will still
succeed, Phyllis,

750
00:59:16,566 --> 00:59:18,500
although
it's changed slightly.

751
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:26,665
When the police come,

752
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:29,337
I shall tell them
of your strange actions lately.

753
00:59:29,412 --> 00:59:32,279
Barry and Carol
will bear me out.

754
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:35,182
They will call it...
suicide, my dear,

755
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,554
through fear
of insanity.

756
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:41,616
[Shuddering,
Sobbing]

757
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:46,989
<i>[Door Opens]</i>
Hannah!

758
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:52,700
I heard you.
Now I know what
you've been doing...

759
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:55,203
with that drug
you kept hid
in my kitchen cupboard.

760
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:57,263
Be quiet.
No!

761
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,467
I'm going
for the police.

762
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:25,260
What's happened here?

763
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:30,539
Mother!
She's a murderer.

764
01:00:30,607 --> 01:00:33,075
It's the she-wolf
herself.

765
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:37,742
Phyllis.

766
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:39,782
Phyllis,
are you all right?

767
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:43,285
It's Barry, darling.

768
01:00:46,856 --> 01:00:49,290
She's going to kill me.

769
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,123
She killed the others.

770
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:56,097
No, dear.
She'll never kill
anyone else.

771
01:00:57,305 --> 01:01:03,258
