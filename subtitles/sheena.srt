2
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:03,436
Phil, when did you take this one?

3
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:06,003
A couple of weeks ago.

4
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,833
Phil, that's impossible.
This man can't still be alive.

5
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:12,379
He's covered in tumors from head to foot.

6
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:51,710
May l take a sample?

7
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:53,651
This ground is sacred.

8
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,625
-We're both doctors, you know.
-Sacred ground!

9
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,496
No person but the Zambuli
has ever seen it before.

10
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:01,140
My God, it's true.

11
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:04,845
The healing earth exists!

12
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:58,503
The source has got to be
inside Gudjara Mountain.

13
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:00,873
Let's have a shot at it.

14
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,971
l have the wobblies.
Remember what Chief Haromba said?

15
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:08,243
Yes, caves are strange.
They can have weird echo effects.

16
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:12,483
But you know as well as l do, Betts,
echoes don't kill people.

17
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,262
Mommy!

18
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:56,285
Mom!

19
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:27,384
We'll take a sample here.

20
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:52,841
Mommy!

21
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:54,777
Janet?

22
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:02,009
The prophecy has come to pass.

23
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:05,542
On a day
when the sacred mountain cries out...

24
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:10,821
...a golden God-child
shall come from the depths of Gudjara.

25
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:16,153
And she shall grow in wisdom
and be the protector of the Zambulis...

26
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,822
...and all their creatures.

27
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:24,829
And she shall be called
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

28
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:01,473
Sleep now, little daughter.

29
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,373
This long day is over.

30
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:12,212
Much to learn, more to forget.

31
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,710
This is Shaba, the water horse.

32
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,513
lt came to me!

33
00:11:56,257 --> 00:12:01,593
Small person summons small creature.
You will grow, my daughter.

34
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,686
Are you all right?

35
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,038
A thousand, thousand moons ago...

36
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:57,805
...before She-Who-ls-Unknown
taught us peace...

37
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,473
...the Zambulis were great archers.

38
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:04,708
You will recall this when your time comes.

39
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:07,779
When will that be, Shaman?

40
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,652
l cannot say, Sheena.

41
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,455
But there will be great trouble
over the land.

42
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,854
You will know it when it comes.

43
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:56,246
-Good morning, your Highness.
-Hi, baby!

44
00:16:56,323 --> 00:16:59,690
-Tell Mr. Grizzard l'm on my way up.
-Right away.

45
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:30,087
-You've got it?
-Right here.

46
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:34,961
lt's confirmation of the sample
from the geo-satellite.

47
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:37,390
lt's titanium all right!

48
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,426
Look at that, see that?

49
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,125
The Gudjara Mountain.

50
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,332
lt's practically made of it!

51
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,566
There are billions in there for you....
And me, Prince. Right?

52
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:54,441
Burn it!

53
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:59,747
You mean it's on for tonight?

54
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:01,945
Yes!

55
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:06,383
Historically speaking,
killing a king has often brought bad luck.

56
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:08,928
Especially when he's your brother.

57
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,554
lt's the only way.

58
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:13,499
He has this thing about the Zambulis.

59
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,228
Nobody steps on their turf.

60
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:20,301
-As long as he's king--
-Yeah, l know. No mining on Zambuli land.

61
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:27,104
Here's your prescription, Grizzy.
Take them after a meal.

62
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,582
l've added a cute touch, by the way.
You know those TV guys who are coming?

63
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,212
My pal, Vic Casey.

64
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,848
-What about him?
-Story on me for Sportsworld.

65
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:41,483
They'll be there tonight.
They'll catch my act on film.

66
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:44,824
-Sounds pretty risky.
-Not a bit!

67
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:48,798
My grief will break your heart.

68
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:52,234
-l don't like it!
-Trust me, man.

69
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:56,264
l'm the guy who kicked a 68-yard field goal
against the Denvers!

70
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,837
Who can stop me?

71
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:35,175
Shaman, we're not camping here?

72
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:40,618
You make camp.
This is the end of our Zambuli lands.

73
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:44,924
-From here, l walk alone.
-Please, don't go.

74
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,464
l must go. The city is a place of evil.
l've never visited one in my life.

75
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:55,591
But you know l must go there
to warn the king.

76
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:59,399
Are you sure he is in danger?

77
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:01,704
One is sure of nothing.

78
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:05,740
But l had the vision again last night.

79
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,710
l saw him lying in his own blood.

80
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:13,282
Our lands destroyed by a strange flame.

81
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:18,488
The heart torn
from our sacred mountain of Gudjara.

82
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:24,254
This cannot be.
Who would kill such a good king?

83
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:29,166
An enemy. One who takes without asking.

84
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:32,972
Embrace me now.

85
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:38,043
My heart goes with you, Shaman.
And my fear.

86
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:43,512
Keep the fear inside you.
l carry enough of my own.

87
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:14,472
l lost count. How many have l had so far?
Six or seven?

88
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,743
You're going down the drain, Fletch.

89
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,944
You're right. Twenty pounds or else.

90
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:24,587
How's this for an opening shot?
We'll start in close on the tee.

91
00:21:25,592 --> 00:21:27,059
You're kidding.

92
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:30,995
The King of Tigora is gonna bend down
and hold the football for a place kick?

93
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:35,057
When it's his brother Otwani kicking
for national television, he will.

94
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:38,195
Good luck.
l know you're pals with Otwani, but he....

95
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,142
Holy shit!

96
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,404
Look, right down there by the falls!

97
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:51,349
Where are we now? What are we by?

98
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:54,649
Tigora, sir.
Near the end of Zambuli territory.

99
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:57,222
Any white folk here?

100
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,656
No, very black!

101
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:03,958
King Jabalani keeps even us Tigorans
out of Zambuli land.

102
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,929
l'll bite, what did l miss?

103
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:11,698
You're not gonna believe this, Vic.
l just saw a blonde!

104
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:13,637
A blonde what?

105
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,870
A blonde. A girl!
She was swinging in the trees!

106
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:18,604
You mean a blonde gorilla?

107
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:22,210
l know the difference
between a gorilla and a girl!

108
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,275
You know, l'm worried.

109
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:29,012
Eight thousand miles from home,
my cameraman's mind has gone to mush...

110
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,216
...on some whacked-out water diet!

111
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,952
l know what l saw.

112
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:36,387
l know you did, and l believe you.

113
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:40,189
Page 4. Any problem with the setup?

114
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:08,824
Here's your prescription, Grizzy,
take them after a meal.

115
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,951
My man! What's happening!

116
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,621
My buddy!

117
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:19,892
Bad man of the Cougars!
How are you doing?

118
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:24,802
Astonishing. ls that the normal
greeting in your country?

119
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:28,068
lt's called a ''high five.'' Try it.
l'm Vic Casey.

120
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:33,239
Welcome to Tigora, Mr. Casey.
l'm King Jabalani.

121
00:24:33,947 --> 00:24:36,472
Oh, Jesus. Excuse me.

122
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:39,545
l found it tingling and delightful.

123
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:46,292
Our intended bride, Princess Zanda.

124
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,968
Cool!

125
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,497
Please follow us, Mr. Casey.

126
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:02,604
Fletch, get the bags, will you?

127
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:19,484
What's wrong? Are you lost?

128
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:24,320
l am not. Do l look lost?

129
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,033
You look like a Zambuli.

130
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:31,164
That is true. l am their shaman.

131
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:34,869
l have journeyed many days to Azan.

132
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,366
Where do l find the king?

133
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:39,841
So you want the king?

134
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:46,610
l've told you that already. Take me to him.

135
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:50,553
You're coming with us.

136
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:37,366
You would prefer the head of the table
for yourself, dear brother?

137
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,204
Not at all.

138
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:49,079
l have heard a strange rumor.

139
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,977
The cellar of the Grand Hotel
has armed guests.

140
00:26:55,054 --> 00:26:56,612
Extremely strange.

141
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,590
You think someone's planning
a revolution?

142
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:05,159
l think it would be very wise
if you were to look into this.

143
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:16,172
Why are you here? You know it's not safe.

144
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,574
Mary, run to the Grand Hotel.

145
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:24,611
Tell Colonel Jorgenson l said
to keep his head down for a few hours.

146
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,514
Yes, Sir.

147
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:27,576
He's discovered something?

148
00:27:27,987 --> 00:27:30,649
Nothing serious. Relax.

149
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:39,992
Did you hear the Zambuli shaman
has come to town?

150
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:44,631
Of course l've heard. l've had her arrested.

151
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,338
Are you crazy? Why?
What if Jabalani finds out?

152
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,641
He never will.

153
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:57,643
A Zambuli Bow.

154
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:04,456
A dead king.
And a Zambuli shaman to hang for it!

155
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:11,762
What could be neater?

156
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:20,802
You're pretty good.

157
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:26,944
You're so wrong.
l am the most wicked woman in Tigora.

158
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,699
Marika!

159
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:12,987
l can't believe it!
Dinner at the palace, right?

160
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,856
l'm supposed to have cheese today.

161
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,191
l bet they have breadfruit and lasagna.

162
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:18,855
Be good for you.

163
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:24,064
Excellent preventative
against seeing imaginary blondes!

164
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:30,136
l'm telling you she was not imaginary!
l know a girl when l see one!

165
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:33,770
What was she doing in the jungle?
Her junior year abroad?

166
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:40,008
We missed our floor.

167
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,650
Tell me again. At the airport
you saw a helicopter gunship?

168
00:29:50,063 --> 00:29:55,899
No! Our story is about a guy
who kicks 60-yard field goals...

169
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:58,459
...and his brother is a king. That's it!

170
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,984
Center pic. Good, hold it there.

171
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,516
Higher up. Good.

172
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:22,761
Right, come on, Fletch, follow the pigs.

173
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:28,526
Watch the boobs
coming into the right of your frame.

174
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,398
Boobs? What kind of talk is that?

175
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,531
As in tits. Zanda, the king's sweetie.
We're for network, remember?

176
00:30:34,607 --> 00:30:37,974
l see what you mean!
Boy, do l see what you mean!

177
00:30:47,253 --> 00:30:48,550
Okay, follow the pigs.

178
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:58,224
-Jammed!
-Clear it, l need this shot!

179
00:30:58,297 --> 00:31:00,288
A toast, dear friends.

180
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:04,894
A toast to our beloved brother,
Prince Otwani.

181
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:11,674
May his exploits with his royal foot...

182
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:18,206
...lead him to that curious American glory,
which l confess, puzzles me completely...

183
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,709
-Got it.
-Go.

184
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:25,356
...''Superbowl champions''!

185
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,200
Give me another magazine, quick!

186
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:46,100
Take this to the lab!
Start it through the soup, go on!

187
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:53,576
A Zambuli arrow!

188
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,924
lt's a Zambuli woman.
We caught her with a bow.

189
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,742
No, Otwani! You are the king now.

190
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:21,379
You are quite right, Princess Zanda.

191
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,051
We'll leave her to the hangman.

192
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,622
Nairobi, Capetown....

193
00:32:31,424 --> 00:32:33,187
Okay, that's got it.

194
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,523
l don't give a damn,
just tell me where l can rent a Learjet!

195
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:40,958
Baby, you are talking to a man in pain.

196
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:43,729
l am sitting on an Emmy
and l can't get it out!

197
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:46,966
-You know what that means?
-Sounds like he needs a laxative!

198
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:49,600
Here's the piece
where the camera jammed.

199
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:52,269
No, 86 that, it was off the action.

200
00:32:52,445 --> 00:32:55,243
Look at it first.
There might be a good frame or two.

201
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:56,941
Look at it first.

202
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,114
What is this?

203
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:05,123
l don't know.
Let's look at it on the viewer.

204
00:33:05,825 --> 00:33:08,259
Vic, take a look at this.

205
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:14,132
Right down in there.

206
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:20,464
Well, whatever it is, it's in a tree.
Look. There's the branch.

207
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,510
l'll run it ahead a bit.

208
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:29,043
Now, what's that line going across there?

209
00:33:29,315 --> 00:33:31,010
Looks like a scratch.

210
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:35,146
That's no scratch,
it's an arrow coming out of that tree...

211
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,486
...going in just the right direction
to kill the king.

212
00:33:39,926 --> 00:33:43,555
And that is a steel crossbow firing it.

213
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,497
And that's not a Zambuli bow, for sure!

214
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:50,461
Jesus, kid, if you're right,
you just got your union card!

215
00:33:51,037 --> 00:33:53,528
''Top of the news,'' the man says.
''Dan Rather time.''

216
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:58,275
We could get killed doing this!
l'm talking about bullets through the head!

217
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:00,369
Let's just turn around and go back.

218
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:04,746
All right, Fletch, you're absolutely right.
First plane in the morning, l promise.

219
00:34:04,984 --> 00:34:08,920
l want to interview that Zambuli woman
they've got locked in jail first.

220
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,985
Not only is he suicidal, he's crazy!

221
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:15,459
They're not going to let us
just walk up in there, you know.

222
00:34:15,528 --> 00:34:17,018
l have a pass.

223
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,430
A what? Let me see it!

224
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:45,951
What are you waiting for?

225
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:50,552
-The battery has gone dead!
-Too bad!

226
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:55,067
We'll start with an establishing shot,
then l want to zoom in on the gate.

227
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:33,837
Back when we played ''doctor,''
that's what we called a girl. A blonde!

228
00:35:33,906 --> 00:35:36,773
Fletch, l apologize! Roll, roll it!

229
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:59,446
-Vic, that's jungle up ahead.
-Sure looks like it.

230
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:01,986
l'm a city boy.
l get paranoid going to zoos!

231
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:03,713
Close your eyes.

232
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:30,710
We are ready to go.

233
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,017
Mission: Find and kill!

234
00:38:35,387 --> 00:38:38,788
lt's your neck if that shaman lives to talk.

235
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:43,794
And ditto for Mr. Casey
if he's made contact and got her story.

236
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,261
Consider them dead.

237
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:48,894
And the girl.

238
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:52,062
l want to see her alive.
She sounds interesting.

239
00:38:52,171 --> 00:38:55,197
Not to me! You will kill her on sight,
Colonel Jorgenson!

240
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:59,937
Cool it! No women's lib stuff around here,
l give the orders!

241
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:02,810
With them finished,
it's on to Gudjara full speed.

242
00:39:40,786 --> 00:39:41,980
What's wrong?

243
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,786
Hoof prints.

244
00:39:47,326 --> 00:39:49,021
Running, l think.

245
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:55,226
-How many toes has a zebra got, if any?
-He thinks he's the Last of the Mohicans!

246
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:59,829
l could sue you for kidnapping
and you're bugging me about zebra toes?

247
00:39:59,905 --> 00:40:00,872
All right!

248
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:04,906
l admit we have as much chance
of finding her here as a McDonalds.

249
00:40:04,977 --> 00:40:09,437
But Fletch, we both saw her.
And while there's hope....

250
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,128
Nice kitty, nice.

251
00:40:38,277 --> 00:40:39,266
Heel.

252
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,808
Make that plural.

253
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,513
Your friends?

254
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:12,138
Do you want to die?

255
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:14,408
No.

256
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:19,515
Then go back! Tell the rest of your evil,
killing tribe not to hunt us!

257
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:28,158
You will remain here
to be sure he obeys me.

258
00:41:28,594 --> 00:41:29,822
Get out!

259
00:41:31,196 --> 00:41:32,823
l don't think so.

260
00:41:57,756 --> 00:41:59,121
They understand you?

261
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:01,022
Of course!

262
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:03,726
Who are you?

263
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:08,832
l am Sheena.

264
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:17,532
l'm Vic Casey.

265
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,504
l cold-cocked that guard
when he was about to shoot you.

266
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,445
Remember?

267
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:26,507
You will be safe inside the circle.
Do not cross it.

268
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:29,143
Kibor, you stay here!

269
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,441
Hey, where are you going?

270
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,164
Who is that girl?

271
00:43:53,105 --> 00:43:54,402
You okay?

272
00:43:54,907 --> 00:43:56,067
Where are we?

273
00:43:56,141 --> 00:43:57,870
Central Park. Why?

274
00:44:01,914 --> 00:44:04,474
Thank God. l thought l was....

275
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:08,885
We really have to do something
about this park!

276
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:11,184
lt's getting worse all the time.

277
00:44:22,968 --> 00:44:26,096
Your hand, it's so cold.

278
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,337
The flame departs.

279
00:44:34,446 --> 00:44:35,970
Don't leave me.

280
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:41,779
l must, daughter.
My time is done, as yours is beginning.

281
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:44,280
lt was foretold.

282
00:44:45,257 --> 00:44:49,489
Sheena will protect the Zambulis
at a time of great trouble.

283
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,095
She'll guard the sacred mountain...

284
00:44:53,632 --> 00:44:56,465
...from the men
who would tear out its riches.

285
00:44:57,135 --> 00:45:01,868
How? What can one woman do
against a man so strong...

286
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,999
...so evil as Otwani?

287
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:19,085
You're not alone.
l see a friend at your side.

288
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,258
Who? How will l know who it is?

289
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,763
How does one ever know?

290
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,601
You'll look at his eyes. You'll see.

291
00:45:33,538 --> 00:45:35,130
You must go now.

292
00:45:35,907 --> 00:45:38,398
Leave me in the home
Chango has made for me.

293
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:41,705
Shaman. Mother.

294
00:45:42,814 --> 00:45:47,649
How soft, my daughter,
how pleasing to me.

295
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:51,645
Your tears upon me,
to extinguish the last embers.

296
00:45:52,824 --> 00:45:55,850
My Sheena, my queen.

297
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:47,178
This is amazing!
lt even keeps the mosquitoes out!

298
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,192
Now tell me. Why did you follow us?

299
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:17,507
We're storytellers, with pictures, too.

300
00:47:18,143 --> 00:47:20,873
And, baby, have we got a story here!

301
00:47:21,313 --> 00:47:24,646
Take me to that Zambuli woman
you busted out of jail.

302
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,610
The shaman? You want to see her?

303
00:47:29,187 --> 00:47:32,054
Yes, you see l know she didn't kill the king.

304
00:47:32,257 --> 00:47:37,194
Let me carry her own words home with me
and l can prove it to the whole world.

305
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:39,196
You must think l'm a fool.

306
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:41,126
Words are like the wind.

307
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,326
They cannot be carried home.

308
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:45,396
They can.

309
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,099
You must think I'm a fool.
Words are like the wind.

310
00:47:49,374 --> 00:47:51,137
They cannot be carried home.

311
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,606
lt bugs me, too.

312
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:58,137
Listen, why don't you just take him
to your shammie...your shaman?

313
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,116
She's gone far ahead.

314
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:06,522
You will have to take a long journey
with me.

315
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:08,550
l'd love to.

316
00:48:09,528 --> 00:48:12,986
He sneaks back to Azan
to ship out some film we left there.

317
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:16,494
-l go with you.
-l like it!

318
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,335
Anybody object?

319
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,117
There is danger!

320
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:05,709
Come on, let's go! Get in here!

321
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:10,754
Get the film!

322
00:49:40,051 --> 00:49:41,040
Shit!

323
00:50:09,915 --> 00:50:11,075
Climb.

324
00:50:17,622 --> 00:50:19,419
Come on, Vic Casey.

325
00:51:24,055 --> 00:51:25,044
Colonel...

326
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:29,224
...somebody slipped.
Yeah, he fell right here.

327
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:31,385
Did they go on?

328
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,158
l'm not sure.

329
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:35,631
Find out.
That's what you're being paid for.

330
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:15,471
-l asked you, did they go on?
-l already told you. l'm not sure.

331
00:52:17,075 --> 00:52:18,064
All right.

332
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:22,776
We hike back to the vehicles.

333
00:52:32,257 --> 00:52:34,589
We sure handled that okay.

334
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:25,700
Fletch, you shouldn't be in Azan.
They are looking for you!

335
00:53:25,777 --> 00:53:29,213
l know.
They were at the lab a half-hour ago.

336
00:53:30,048 --> 00:53:32,881
-You're probably going to be next!
-What?

337
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,646
How many have l had now? Let's see...

338
00:53:37,722 --> 00:53:42,022
...three, no, l had six, seven....
l am going insane!

339
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,754
What is happening?

340
00:53:52,871 --> 00:53:55,601
All right, Juka, you did it, you got it!

341
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:58,471
The village where l was born
is only a few miles away.

342
00:53:58,576 --> 00:54:00,407
We'll be safe there.

343
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:02,877
-Where is Vic?
-Don't ask!

344
00:54:58,603 --> 00:55:02,403
Why don't you come in and wash?
You're as dirty as a wart hog!

345
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:07,440
No, l don't think so.

346
00:55:08,613 --> 00:55:10,376
Water frightens you?

347
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,015
Well, no, not exactly.

348
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:21,325
Come in, Vic Casey, the water is cold!

349
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:25,192
lt's so good for you!

350
00:55:26,464 --> 00:55:28,659
Remove those strange skins you wear.

351
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:33,160
From what animal do they come?

352
00:55:33,504 --> 00:55:36,598
The wild silk moth.
lt roams in Bloomingdale's.

353
00:55:40,445 --> 00:55:44,176
-Fur! You have fur!
-l have what?

354
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:49,312
The Zambuli men do not have fur
on their bodies. This cannot be.

355
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,259
Would you go back in the water, please?

356
00:55:57,795 --> 00:55:58,853
Why?

357
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,611
Red One to Hawk One, do you copy?

358
00:56:24,222 --> 00:56:26,156
Hawk One copies Red One, over.

359
00:56:26,457 --> 00:56:28,049
How's it coming?

360
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,250
Very good. Over.

361
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:34,231
What l want to hear is, ''Very soon.''

362
00:57:08,032 --> 00:57:10,159
We will be safe here for a while.

363
00:57:10,234 --> 00:57:12,759
They would never believe
you could run over such rocks.

364
00:57:12,837 --> 00:57:16,364
-Me?
-Of course. They know l can run anywhere.

365
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:29,351
Difficult on their feet.
l think we catch them now.

366
00:57:33,624 --> 00:57:34,613
Wadman.

367
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:38,025
-What's the matter?
-Nothing is the matter. Tracks.

368
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:44,224
Zebra, deep.

369
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,605
-Must be carrying a heavy load.
-Somebody riding it, you mean?

370
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:49,662
Yeah.

371
00:57:50,975 --> 00:57:52,966
-Maybe two people.
-Good.

372
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:54,706
Let's go!

373
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:10,325
Your hair smells fantastic!
What did you wash it with?

374
00:58:10,395 --> 00:58:13,330
Zam Zam berries!
What else would a woman use?

375
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:15,558
Are your feet better now?

376
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:19,091
l think it's just possible
l might walk again sometime.

377
00:58:19,804 --> 00:58:21,601
Sometime very soon.

378
00:58:26,811 --> 00:58:31,145
Rest, Marika. Eat.
l will summon you again soon. Go ahead.

379
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,519
Come on, Vic Casey.

380
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:47,025
The dry season.
They cannot find anything to eat.

381
00:58:48,332 --> 00:58:50,823
That big one in front, he's looking at me.

382
00:58:51,636 --> 00:58:54,662
That's a cow, Vic Casey.
All the big ones are cows.

383
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,401
They wouldn't eat you
if you were the last thing on earth.

384
00:58:57,475 --> 00:59:00,069
Sheena, where did you learn all this?

385
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:04,039
Shaman taught me.
She told me everything.

386
00:59:06,184 --> 00:59:07,515
l'm sorry.

387
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:10,614
Sorry?

388
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:17,519
l sat up last night.
You talked in your sleep.

389
00:59:18,296 --> 00:59:19,820
l know she's gone.

390
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:24,166
Then why do you still travel with me?

391
00:59:24,235 --> 00:59:28,137
You said it was to find the shaman,
to catch her words in your box.

392
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:30,504
l did want to. That was the truth.

393
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:34,110
But since then, l've found other reasons.

394
00:59:34,345 --> 00:59:36,006
Say what you mean.

395
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:38,946
lt's called chemistry.

396
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:43,009
Say what you mean. Stop using words
you know l do not understand.

397
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,699
Do you understand that?

398
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:58,791
No.

399
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:04,865
Mouths were given us to eat with.
Why did you touch yours to mine?

400
01:00:34,272 --> 01:00:37,264
There's your 10,
and l'll raise you 10 more.

401
01:00:41,112 --> 01:00:44,047
Sorry, Gramps. Queens full.

402
01:00:44,148 --> 01:00:47,584
You lose!
Mombassa straight beat full house.

403
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:50,084
This pile of junk?

404
01:00:50,154 --> 01:00:55,114
All red color!
One jack, rest of cards all even number.

405
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,020
Mombassa straight!

406
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:07,559
Otwani has cut the long lines.
No calls outside Tigora.

407
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,667
-And the airports?
-Closed. No airplanes.

408
01:01:11,075 --> 01:01:14,977
But the bastards are working awful hard
to fix the gun-chopper.

409
01:01:15,613 --> 01:01:16,773
Jesus!

410
01:01:17,682 --> 01:01:18,671
Vic!

411
01:01:23,321 --> 01:01:25,949
These Zambulis of yours,
do they have guns?

412
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:29,291
Never! Guns are bad. Arrows!

413
01:01:29,927 --> 01:01:32,760
Against machine guns?
Against armored cars?

414
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:37,624
A thousand, thousand moons ago,
they were the greatest of all warriors.

415
01:01:37,702 --> 01:01:40,933
Before She-Who-ls-Unknown
brought peace to every creature.

416
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:42,131
lt is told!

417
01:01:45,376 --> 01:01:47,071
You make me want to cry.

418
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,508
For what?

419
01:01:50,314 --> 01:01:51,906
Just everything.

420
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:00,315
These are good. We'll eat here.

421
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:02,750
We need strength.

422
01:02:19,677 --> 01:02:22,441
Tiki saw something. Wait here.

423
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:27,506
Sheena.

424
01:02:29,186 --> 01:02:30,813
Look through these.

425
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,283
Try them, they're magic.

426
01:02:37,728 --> 01:02:40,788
Bad magic!
They've made you into a pygmy!

427
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:43,327
Try the other end.

428
01:02:50,841 --> 01:02:53,469
Vic Casey, you are a giant!

429
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:56,146
Occasionally.

430
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:08,975
We'll blow it up!

431
01:04:09,253 --> 01:04:12,484
All right, get some plastics
and blow the damned thing up!

432
01:04:14,091 --> 01:04:15,820
Chango has stopped them.

433
01:04:16,861 --> 01:04:18,658
The soldier wagons drink water.

434
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,994
-Gasoline. How far back?
-An hour's running.

435
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:25,694
-An hour's running for you or me?
-You.

436
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:29,266
That's way too close.
Come on, we have to get out of here.

437
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,971
All right, get behind the vehicles. Move!

438
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,856
Fletch, you are drinking
from two glasses now?

439
01:04:51,729 --> 01:04:54,789
That's right,
because there's two of me to get smashed!

440
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:56,560
-Two of you?
-Yeah.

441
01:04:57,334 --> 01:05:01,293
Fletch Number 1: he says,
''Go on up to Central Park, find Vic!''

442
01:05:01,906 --> 01:05:04,534
Fletch Number 2:
he says, ''To hell with that fool.

443
01:05:04,608 --> 01:05:08,806
''Walk across the border,
get the film out and get myself an Emmy.''

444
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:11,770
Cheers.

445
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,185
-How many have l had now?
-Fletch Number 1...

446
01:05:17,254 --> 01:05:22,157
...if you want to go up into the park,
l know the greatest tracker in Tigora.

447
01:05:22,226 --> 01:05:25,024
l don't.
l'd rather jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.

448
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:30,727
Where is he?

449
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,717
This is murder!

450
01:06:57,988 --> 01:07:02,857
These thorn trees are our friends.
They will let us rest for the night in safety.

451
01:07:03,928 --> 01:07:05,259
What do you mean?

452
01:07:05,596 --> 01:07:08,087
The soldier wagons
must come through here.

453
01:07:08,165 --> 01:07:11,362
Their round rubber feet
will be wrecked to pieces.

454
01:07:20,444 --> 01:07:22,139
This forest ends soon.

455
01:07:25,115 --> 01:07:29,313
We will be at the Lake of Birds.
The Zambuli lands begin there.

456
01:07:41,365 --> 01:07:44,857
Across those hills is Z'Kuru,
the first Zambuli village.

457
01:07:45,402 --> 01:07:48,462
My feet will be swifter
when they're back on the sacred land.

458
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:50,769
You must be kidding! Swifter?

459
01:07:51,642 --> 01:07:53,234
Such beauty!

460
01:07:54,378 --> 01:07:55,709
Beyond belief.

461
01:07:57,181 --> 01:07:59,706
l have been here at sunset 100 times.

462
01:08:00,551 --> 01:08:03,111
And it has never moved me
as it does tonight.

463
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:08,558
-Shall l tell you why?
-Please.

464
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:11,322
l am not a foolish young girl, Vic Casey.

465
01:08:11,662 --> 01:08:15,996
The shaman taught me that brave tales
do not always have happy endings.

466
01:08:16,367 --> 01:08:18,335
l know what guns can do.

467
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:22,432
l know that you and l may not live
to see another sunset.

468
01:08:35,085 --> 01:08:37,781
-You are an enemy.
-l'm what?

469
01:08:39,123 --> 01:08:40,886
The shaman taught me.

470
01:08:41,358 --> 01:08:43,792
An enemy is one
who takes without asking.

471
01:08:45,362 --> 01:08:48,297
l'll ask then. May l?

472
01:08:53,537 --> 01:08:54,595
Yes.

473
01:09:44,088 --> 01:09:46,886
Hold it!

474
01:09:49,326 --> 01:09:50,987
Refuel!

475
01:09:54,998 --> 01:09:56,556
What's going on here?

476
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:01,530
These men got dragged
through the thorn trees!

477
01:10:03,507 --> 01:10:05,236
So bury them!

478
01:10:12,483 --> 01:10:14,474
lt was a tiring night.

479
01:10:16,787 --> 01:10:18,948
The morale of the men is not good.

480
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:24,552
-A little killing is going to cheer them up.
-l don't understand.

481
01:10:24,628 --> 01:10:26,425
We're in Zambuli territory.

482
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:29,421
Z'Kuru, next village. We hit it!

483
01:10:30,534 --> 01:10:33,264
Their direct line of flight to Gudjara is here.

484
01:10:34,505 --> 01:10:36,769
Z'Kuru is off to the side.

485
01:10:36,874 --> 01:10:39,775
l don't care! We zap Z'Kuru!

486
01:10:40,644 --> 01:10:44,011
Now, the message goes ahead
by the jungle telegraph.

487
01:10:44,815 --> 01:10:49,047
Those Zambulis up in Gudjara
won't stop running till they hit Cairo!

488
01:10:51,488 --> 01:10:53,080
lt is good psychology.

489
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,692
lt is good for the men.

490
01:10:57,694 --> 01:11:00,492
Looks like you're going to enjoy it,
too, Jorgie.

491
01:11:03,534 --> 01:11:04,796
Oh, yeah.

492
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:10,531
You will be made welcome in Z'Kuru.

493
01:11:10,607 --> 01:11:14,407
The headman's locust-bean cakes,
they'll be your locust-bean cakes.

494
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:18,410
His fermented buffalo milk
will be your fermented buffalo milk.

495
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:21,508
-His week-old dried--
-Please, l'm eating!

496
01:11:23,053 --> 01:11:26,045
l will speak to the men
of the time of arrows.

497
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:29,091
We will take our bows
and attack the soldier wagons!

498
01:11:31,128 --> 01:11:33,653
-What was that?
-An earthquake, maybe.

499
01:11:34,965 --> 01:11:36,694
The land roars at Otwani.

500
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:59,719
-No!
-Let me see!

501
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:50,929
We'll beat the bastards to Gudjara
somehow and sound a warning.

502
01:12:51,942 --> 01:12:54,570
lt's the only way to save their lives.

503
01:13:09,192 --> 01:13:11,387
How can fire burn so hot?

504
01:13:12,796 --> 01:13:15,492
How can even stone pots
be made into ashes?

505
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,864
Gas, probably. Gasoline.

506
01:13:26,143 --> 01:13:27,872
You spoke of that before.

507
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:31,076
The water the wagons drink.

508
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:48,392
You are wrong, Vic Casey.

509
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:52,761
Warning is not the only way
to save people's lives!

510
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:54,793
What else can we do?

511
01:13:55,238 --> 01:13:56,569
Stop Otwani!

512
01:13:58,108 --> 01:13:59,097
Come!

513
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,284
Here's one with the sap dripping out.

514
01:14:24,968 --> 01:14:26,458
Make flame.

515
01:14:32,642 --> 01:14:33,973
Good.

516
01:14:34,778 --> 01:14:38,111
You shape this with your blade.
l'll make fire grass.

517
01:15:00,904 --> 01:15:04,271
-lt is a good arrow.
-Yes, but it's front-heavy.

518
01:15:07,577 --> 01:15:09,602
Yes, by three fingers.

519
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,417
They're coming!

520
01:15:38,809 --> 01:15:42,802
lt's the third truck from the front.
The one with the iron drums.

521
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:46,311
l see it. Get your flame ready.

522
01:16:01,531 --> 01:16:02,520
Light it!

523
01:16:38,201 --> 01:16:40,101
My God, you've done it!

524
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,402
Red One!

525
01:17:53,076 --> 01:17:55,340
They're on the ridge! Go get them!

526
01:18:52,535 --> 01:18:55,163
-lt's circling away!
-For a better shot at us!

527
01:18:55,238 --> 01:18:57,229
What do we do, Vic Casey?

528
01:18:57,307 --> 01:19:00,674
The smart thing would be
to stand up and wave this.

529
01:19:01,077 --> 01:19:04,535
Your cloth. lt's magic?
lt destroys the firebird?

530
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:06,849
No, it says we give up.

531
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:14,348
We can make it to those trees down there.
Come on, run!

532
01:19:38,114 --> 01:19:41,515
Hawk One to Red One.
Red One, what's taking you so long?

533
01:19:42,419 --> 01:19:45,217
We're tracking them. They're in the trees.

534
01:20:18,588 --> 01:20:22,684
Marika, warn them! Get them to safety.

535
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:37,595
Go!

536
01:20:48,318 --> 01:20:49,307
Go!

537
01:21:27,323 --> 01:21:29,757
Wait a minute, l spot their transport!

538
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:10,754
l swear to God, l'd do it all over again.

539
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:12,786
That pleases me.

540
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:16,631
l'm sorry.
There's so much l'd like to show you.

541
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,431
What would you show me?

542
01:23:18,501 --> 01:23:21,664
l'd show you the view
of the Trade Towers from my loft.

543
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:26,134
When you're walking down Wall Street
at night eating a sack of peanuts.

544
01:23:27,277 --> 01:23:29,142
Hell, forget them!

545
01:23:29,646 --> 01:23:33,742
lt is easy, because there is so much
you did show me.

546
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,628
-Thank you, Vic Casey.
-You're thanking me?

547
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:52,029
The fire in my veins tells me l'm still alive.

548
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:55,132
l have not failed my people yet!

549
01:24:03,012 --> 01:24:04,741
lt's pretty amazing.

550
01:24:05,048 --> 01:24:08,279
You've been on my turf all my life
and l've never met you.

551
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,911
How have the Zambuli ever hurt you?

552
01:24:13,623 --> 01:24:15,318
Why do you chain me?

553
01:24:15,825 --> 01:24:19,625
l'm your king. l can do anything l want.

554
01:24:21,197 --> 01:24:24,724
-Don't even think of it!
-l'll try not to.

555
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:30,269
-What would you do with her?
-She's protector of those savages, no?

556
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:32,734
That's her story.

557
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:35,471
l would fly her over Gudjara.

558
01:24:36,179 --> 01:24:39,307
l would drop her
in the great Zambuli Falls...

559
01:24:40,083 --> 01:24:42,313
...with the whole tribe watching.

560
01:24:43,252 --> 01:24:45,550
l like your imagination, Zanda.

561
01:24:46,055 --> 01:24:47,283
You'll do it?

562
01:24:48,024 --> 01:24:49,252
Sorry.

563
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,922
Take her away.

564
01:24:56,866 --> 01:24:59,096
And bring us Mr. Casey.

565
01:25:10,046 --> 01:25:12,537
You're a hard man to find, Vic, old pal.

566
01:25:13,549 --> 01:25:17,144
You had it made, you asshole!
And then it got to you.

567
01:25:17,453 --> 01:25:18,545
Got to me?

568
01:25:18,755 --> 01:25:22,919
The cheering, the crowds.
The goddamn agents. Guys like me!

569
01:25:23,826 --> 01:25:26,317
You had so much. You wanted it all.

570
01:25:28,464 --> 01:25:33,299
Save that for Sunday school, Vic, old pal.
You should've stuck to your game plan.

571
01:25:33,369 --> 01:25:36,304
When they put the rope around your neck,
you'll wish l had.

572
01:25:36,372 --> 01:25:38,340
Around my neck?

573
01:25:38,408 --> 01:25:40,933
Hey, man, it's fourth down and 99 to go.

574
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:43,774
You're behind with five seconds
left on the clock.

575
01:25:43,846 --> 01:25:46,508
The ball bounces funny
in the last two minutes.

576
01:25:46,582 --> 01:25:48,743
You should see some film l shot.

577
01:25:49,585 --> 01:25:54,079
-l'll watch Sportsworld very closely.
-lt isn't going to be on Sportsworld.

578
01:25:54,157 --> 01:25:58,253
l think it'll get a better rating
at the Organization of African States.

579
01:25:58,327 --> 01:26:02,730
Now, which shot is that?
Me kicking it over the palace roof?

580
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,801
Opens on a roast pig.

581
01:26:05,968 --> 01:26:09,301
Segue into a tree, close shot, night.

582
01:26:10,106 --> 01:26:12,233
Arrow zings from a catapult.

583
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,755
-Where are you taking me?
-Home!

584
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:41,568
We are leaving on a mission at once.
Sealed orders from King Otwani.

585
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:50,975
Now, where is this piece of film?

586
01:26:55,885 --> 01:27:00,117
lf you kill me, that film still goes out.
lt's in Azan in safe hands.

587
01:27:01,924 --> 01:27:03,448
Do you want a deal?

588
01:27:14,537 --> 01:27:16,129
What do you propose?

589
01:27:16,205 --> 01:27:19,038
You sign a treaty to be filed
with the United Nations...

590
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:21,599
...giving independence to the Zambulis.

591
01:27:21,944 --> 01:27:23,741
lt buys you the negative.

592
01:27:23,813 --> 01:27:26,907
You could be bluffing.
l'd have to see it first.

593
01:27:27,216 --> 01:27:28,615
That's fair.

594
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:33,851
Okay, have someone drive him to Azan.
Bring him back with the film.

595
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:36,186
All right, Blau, take him.

596
01:27:38,194 --> 01:27:42,893
No tricks, old pal.
Remember, l'm holding your jungle queen.

597
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:45,492
-That cuts both ways.
-Meaning?

598
01:27:45,568 --> 01:27:49,402
Meaning anything happens to her
while l'm gone, you bastard, you hang!

599
01:27:52,241 --> 01:27:53,868
Lucky man.

600
01:27:55,011 --> 01:27:56,842
l think he scored.

601
01:27:57,713 --> 01:27:59,977
Any tips for me?

602
01:28:16,332 --> 01:28:17,822
Jorgenson!

603
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:22,134
The film comes back.
Casey's ticket is one-way!

604
01:28:27,143 --> 01:28:28,542
What the hell....

605
01:28:32,448 --> 01:28:34,575
l see my death in your eyes.

606
01:28:35,117 --> 01:28:36,880
Red One to Hawk One.

607
01:28:40,456 --> 01:28:43,721
lt was an accident.
Did l damage anything?

608
01:28:49,232 --> 01:28:52,497
You really plan to throw me
into the Zambuli Falls.

609
01:28:53,169 --> 01:28:54,932
lt won't hurt a bit.

610
01:28:55,638 --> 01:28:57,868
lt'll be over before you know it.

611
01:29:02,411 --> 01:29:03,935
My head aches.

612
01:29:04,814 --> 01:29:07,044
Your firebird makes such a noise.

613
01:30:15,718 --> 01:30:19,984
Fly over the village.
Bring them all out for the show.

614
01:31:19,515 --> 01:31:22,916
-They're following us. Back to the falls!
-Wilco.

615
01:31:59,655 --> 01:32:03,250
Bank to the left so l can push her out!

616
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,597
-Get us out of here!
-There's no way!

617
01:34:28,837 --> 01:34:32,796
See? Even in chains we can defeat them!

618
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:37,239
Turn your minds back, my people.

619
01:34:37,947 --> 01:34:42,111
Remember yourselves
a thousand, thousand moons ago!

620
01:34:44,353 --> 01:34:46,184
Bring your bows!

621
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:20,279
Nice melody, huh?

622
01:35:27,363 --> 01:35:28,352
Get out!

623
01:35:30,666 --> 01:35:31,655
Leave!

624
01:36:00,062 --> 01:36:01,620
Chief Haromba.

625
01:36:13,876 --> 01:36:16,140
This is the edge of the Great Forest.

626
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:18,337
We shall wait for them here.

627
01:37:36,992 --> 01:37:39,859
Now, Tiki, pass the word. Come on!

628
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,894
Column, halt! Stragglers!

629
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:57,142
Let's go get those bastards!

630
01:38:00,048 --> 01:38:02,016
First, we secure Gudjara.

631
01:38:02,184 --> 01:38:03,947
Otwani!

632
01:38:04,019 --> 01:38:08,149
As long as l live,
Gudjara Mountain will not be yours!

633
01:38:12,094 --> 01:38:13,425
After her!

634
01:39:32,374 --> 01:39:34,433
-Straight ahead.
-She went off to the left!

635
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,705
-Straight ahead!
-l said, to the left!

636
01:39:59,101 --> 01:40:01,092
-Chief Haromba.
-We are ready.

637
01:40:23,759 --> 01:40:25,556
Hold it!

638
01:40:31,133 --> 01:40:34,068
Let's get out of this damned forest!
Back up!

639
01:40:38,273 --> 01:40:39,467
Attack!

640
01:41:09,771 --> 01:41:12,706
Withdraw! Get them all!

641
01:43:33,682 --> 01:43:34,671
Marika!

642
01:44:09,151 --> 01:44:10,140
Z'Kuru!

643
01:44:19,194 --> 01:44:21,321
l was only following orders.

644
01:44:21,963 --> 01:44:23,328
For Z'Kuru!

645
01:47:07,862 --> 01:47:08,954
Vic Casey.

646
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:13,829
Don't think about it.

647
01:47:14,703 --> 01:47:16,432
How did you do?

648
01:47:17,238 --> 01:47:19,365
They're all gone, dead!

649
01:47:21,509 --> 01:47:22,840
Great!

650
01:47:25,847 --> 01:47:27,610
-Me, too.
-No!

651
01:47:28,883 --> 01:47:33,013
lt's a funny thing about fatal burns....
They say there's no pain.

652
01:47:36,257 --> 01:47:38,350
You're head is as clear as a bell.

653
01:47:40,261 --> 01:47:41,888
l've had it, baby.

654
01:47:43,064 --> 01:47:45,692
And all l can think of to say is, ''Shit!''

655
01:47:59,314 --> 01:48:03,774
Okay, l got the Mombassa straight,
now this Zambesi flush.

656
01:48:03,852 --> 01:48:07,549
That's three red cards,
one black deuce and...

657
01:48:08,456 --> 01:48:11,289
-...a one-eyed jack, right?
-Jack got to be red.

658
01:48:11,993 --> 01:48:15,622
Otherwise got to have
three cards under nine, add up to....

659
01:48:21,002 --> 01:48:22,594
Vic!

660
01:48:23,905 --> 01:48:24,894
No!

661
01:48:25,707 --> 01:48:28,005
-They're killing Vic!
-No, they're not!

662
01:48:28,109 --> 01:48:30,270
-They're murdering him!
-No!

663
01:49:40,348 --> 01:49:43,010
Tell me more about the places
you will show me.

664
01:49:43,084 --> 01:49:45,575
Where the jackals eat? Twenty-one?

665
01:49:48,423 --> 01:49:50,254
l've changed my mind.

666
01:49:50,825 --> 01:49:53,123
You're not seeing any of those places.

667
01:49:57,065 --> 01:49:59,795
-You mean, you stay here?
-l can't.

668
01:50:00,568 --> 01:50:03,401
l've got to take this earth home
to be analyzed in a lab.

669
01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:07,700
Maybe even duplicate it.
lt might even be a cure for cancer.

670
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:10,141
Vic Casey.

671
01:50:11,579 --> 01:50:13,638
l do not understand.

672
01:50:14,616 --> 01:50:17,176
They'd kill you
if they got their hands on you.

673
01:50:17,252 --> 01:50:19,720
-Who would kill me?
-All of us!

674
01:50:19,954 --> 01:50:21,012
You?

675
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,979
Hey, Vic!

676
01:50:25,994 --> 01:50:28,724
Boy, are you guys hard to find! 'Morning.

677
01:50:28,930 --> 01:50:30,795
We'd adore you to death.

678
01:50:30,865 --> 01:50:34,995
With printed words, with moving pictures
that go through the air...

679
01:50:35,069 --> 01:50:37,401
...they'd put stiff hides on your feet.

680
01:50:37,472 --> 01:50:41,238
Listen, Sheena baby, just move
over a little bit so l can get you in the sun.

681
01:50:41,309 --> 01:50:43,743
-Perfect--
-Let me see that a second.

682
01:50:43,811 --> 01:50:48,510
lt'll be really grainy when l blow it up....
What the hell are you doing?

683
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:50,676
We're talking an Emmy here! $1,000,000!

684
01:50:50,752 --> 01:50:52,447
Fletch, get out of here!

685
01:50:53,655 --> 01:50:55,282
A favor.

686
01:51:02,197 --> 01:51:03,926
Forget the $1,000,000, huh?

687
01:51:05,033 --> 01:51:07,627
l'll win it back from you
when we play poker!

688
01:51:17,178 --> 01:51:21,706
lf the world finds out where the healing
earth comes from, this is all gone.

689
01:51:22,383 --> 01:51:25,682
You, the Zambulis,
everything you've got going here.

690
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,961
What are you telling me, Vic Casey?

691
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:46,466
How much l love you, Sheena.
So much it busts my heart!

692
01:52:14,902 --> 01:52:16,699
My heart breaks, also.

693
01:52:19,073 --> 01:52:21,541
Put out the ''Don't Disturb'' sign, will you?

694
01:52:22,243 --> 01:52:23,232
What?

695
01:52:24,178 --> 01:52:25,167
Him.

696
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:31,547
Tell him we won't be disturbed
for a few hours.

697
01:53:14,429 --> 01:53:16,624
Will you return, Vic Casey?

698
01:53:17,999 --> 01:53:20,399
Yes. Say it again.

699
01:53:22,303 --> 01:53:23,770
I love you.

700
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:26,968
Again.

701
01:53:27,675 --> 01:53:30,166
Must we waste this hour on words?

702
01:57:21,650 --> 01:57:24,084
Phil, when did you take this one?

703
01:57:24,786 --> 01:57:26,651
A couple of weeks ago.

704
01:57:27,489 --> 01:57:30,481
Phil, that's impossible.
This man can't still be alive.

705
01:57:30,559 --> 01:57:33,027
He's covered in tumors from head to foot.

706
01:58:10,766 --> 01:58:12,358
May l take a sample?

707
01:58:12,434 --> 01:58:14,299
This ground is sacred.

708
01:58:16,338 --> 01:58:19,273
-We're both doctors, you know.
-Sacred ground!

709
01:58:19,708 --> 01:58:23,144
No person but the Zambuli
has ever seen it before.

710
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:21,788
My God, it's true.

711
02:00:22,831 --> 02:00:25,493
The healing earth exists!

712
02:01:16,284 --> 02:01:19,151
The source has got to be
inside Gudjara Mountain.

713
02:01:19,621 --> 02:01:21,521
Let's have a shot at it.

714
02:01:22,991 --> 02:01:25,619
l have the wobblies.
Remember what Chief Haromba said?

715
02:01:25,694 --> 02:01:28,891
Yes, caves are strange.
They can have weird echo effects.

716
02:01:29,297 --> 02:01:33,131
But you know as well as l do, Betts,
echoes don't kill people.

717
02:01:42,511 --> 02:01:43,910
Mommy!

718
02:02:15,944 --> 02:02:16,933
Mom!

719
02:02:46,041 --> 02:02:48,032
We'll take a sample here.

720
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,489
Mommy!

721
02:03:14,436 --> 02:03:15,425
Janet?

722
02:05:19,961 --> 02:05:22,657
The prophecy has come to pass.

723
02:05:23,164 --> 02:05:26,190
On a day
when the sacred mountain cries out...

724
02:05:27,135 --> 02:05:31,469
...a golden God-child
shall come from the depths of Gudjara.

725
02:05:32,307 --> 02:05:36,801
And she shall grow in wisdom
and be the protector of the Zambulis...

726
02:05:36,878 --> 02:05:38,470
...and all their creatures.

727
02:05:41,950 --> 02:05:45,477
And she shall be called
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

728
02:06:19,721 --> 02:06:22,121
Sleep now, little daughter.

729
02:06:24,826 --> 02:06:27,021
This long day is over.

730
02:06:29,197 --> 02:06:32,860
Much to learn, more to forget.

731
02:06:56,958 --> 02:06:59,358
This is Shaba, the water horse.

732
02:08:14,102 --> 02:08:16,161
lt came to me!

733
02:08:16,905 --> 02:08:22,241
Small person summons small creature.
You will grow, my daughter.

734
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:26,334
Are you all right?

735
02:10:11,853 --> 02:10:14,686
A thousand, thousand moons ago...

736
02:10:15,256 --> 02:10:18,453
...before She-Who-ls-Unknown
taught us peace...

737
02:10:19,027 --> 02:10:22,121
...the Zambulis were great archers.

738
02:10:22,296 --> 02:10:25,356
You will recall this when your time comes.

739
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:28,427
When will that be, Shaman?

740
02:10:28,503 --> 02:10:30,300
l cannot say, Sheena.

741
02:10:30,838 --> 02:10:34,103
But there will be great trouble
over the land.

742
02:10:34,375 --> 02:10:36,502
You will know it when it comes.

743
02:13:14,835 --> 02:13:16,894
-Good morning, your Highness.
-Hi, baby!

744
02:13:16,971 --> 02:13:20,338
-Tell Mr. Grizzard l'm on my way up.
-Right away.

745
02:13:48,369 --> 02:13:50,735
-You've got it?
-Right here.

746
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:55,609
lt's confirmation of the sample
from the geo-satellite.

747
02:13:56,377 --> 02:13:58,038
lt's titanium all right!

748
02:13:58,913 --> 02:14:01,074
Look at that, see that?

749
02:14:01,249 --> 02:14:02,773
The Gudjara Mountain.

750
02:14:03,251 --> 02:14:04,980
lt's practically made of it!

751
02:14:05,686 --> 02:14:10,214
There are billions in there for you....
And me, Prince. Right?

752
02:14:13,861 --> 02:14:15,089
Burn it!

753
02:14:17,164 --> 02:14:20,395
You mean it's on for tonight?

754
02:14:21,535 --> 02:14:22,593
Yes!

755
02:14:23,004 --> 02:14:27,031
Historically speaking,
killing a king has often brought bad luck.

756
02:14:27,642 --> 02:14:29,576
Especially when he's your brother.

757
02:14:29,644 --> 02:14:31,202
lt's the only way.

758
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:34,147
He has this thing about the Zambulis.

759
02:14:34,215 --> 02:14:35,876
Nobody steps on their turf.

760
02:14:36,751 --> 02:14:40,949
-As long as he's king--
-Yeah, l know. No mining on Zambuli land.

761
02:14:44,191 --> 02:14:47,752
Here's your prescription, Grizzy.
Take them after a meal.

762
02:14:49,964 --> 02:14:54,230
l've added a cute touch, by the way.
You know those TV guys who are coming?

763
02:14:54,302 --> 02:14:55,860
My pal, Vic Casey.

764
02:14:55,936 --> 02:14:58,496
-What about him?
-Story on me for Sportsworld.

765
02:14:58,673 --> 02:15:02,131
They'll be there tonight.
They'll catch my act on film.

766
02:15:03,277 --> 02:15:05,472
-Sounds pretty risky.
-Not a bit!

767
02:15:07,581 --> 02:15:09,446
My grief will break your heart.

768
02:15:10,084 --> 02:15:12,882
-l don't like it!
-Trust me, man.

769
02:15:12,953 --> 02:15:16,912
l'm the guy who kicked a 68-yard field goal
against the Denvers!

770
02:15:17,325 --> 02:15:18,485
Who can stop me?

771
02:15:52,626 --> 02:15:55,823
Shaman, we're not camping here?

772
02:15:56,897 --> 02:16:01,266
You make camp.
This is the end of our Zambuli lands.

773
02:16:02,136 --> 02:16:05,572
-From here, l walk alone.
-Please, don't go.

774
02:16:06,207 --> 02:16:12,112
l must go. The city is a place of evil.
l've never visited one in my life.

775
02:16:13,247 --> 02:16:16,239
But you know l must go there
to warn the king.

776
02:16:17,852 --> 02:16:20,047
Are you sure he is in danger?

777
02:16:20,521 --> 02:16:22,352
One is sure of nothing.

778
02:16:23,624 --> 02:16:26,388
But l had the vision again last night.

779
02:16:27,094 --> 02:16:29,358
l saw him lying in his own blood.

780
02:16:30,631 --> 02:16:33,930
Our lands destroyed by a strange flame.

781
02:16:35,336 --> 02:16:39,136
The heart torn
from our sacred mountain of Gudjara.

782
02:16:40,374 --> 02:16:44,902
This cannot be.
Who would kill such a good king?

783
02:16:45,946 --> 02:16:49,814
An enemy. One who takes without asking.

784
02:16:52,153 --> 02:16:53,620
Embrace me now.

785
02:16:54,755 --> 02:16:58,691
My heart goes with you, Shaman.
And my fear.

786
02:16:59,894 --> 02:17:04,160
Keep the fear inside you.
l carry enough of my own.

787
02:17:31,559 --> 02:17:35,120
l lost count. How many have l had so far?
Six or seven?

788
02:17:35,196 --> 02:17:37,391
You're going down the drain, Fletch.

789
02:17:37,465 --> 02:17:39,592
You're right. Twenty pounds or else.

790
02:17:40,901 --> 02:17:45,235
How's this for an opening shot?
We'll start in close on the tee.

791
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,707
You're kidding.

792
02:17:47,775 --> 02:17:51,643
The King of Tigora is gonna bend down
and hold the football for a place kick?

793
02:17:51,712 --> 02:17:55,705
When it's his brother Otwani kicking
for national television, he will.

794
02:17:55,783 --> 02:17:58,843
Good luck.
l know you're pals with Otwani, but he....

795
02:18:02,323 --> 02:18:03,790
Holy shit!

796
02:18:03,958 --> 02:18:07,052
Look, right down there by the falls!

797
02:18:09,563 --> 02:18:11,997
Where are we now? What are we by?

798
02:18:12,066 --> 02:18:15,297
Tigora, sir.
Near the end of Zambuli territory.

799
02:18:15,970 --> 02:18:17,870
Any white folk here?

800
02:18:17,938 --> 02:18:20,304
No, very black!

801
02:18:20,374 --> 02:18:24,606
King Jabalani keeps even us Tigorans
out of Zambuli land.

802
02:18:26,814 --> 02:18:28,577
l'll bite, what did l miss?

803
02:18:28,649 --> 02:18:32,346
You're not gonna believe this, Vic.
l just saw a blonde!

804
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:34,285
A blonde what?

805
02:18:34,355 --> 02:18:37,518
A blonde. A girl!
She was swinging in the trees!

806
02:18:37,591 --> 02:18:39,252
You mean a blonde gorilla?

807
02:18:39,593 --> 02:18:42,858
l know the difference
between a gorilla and a girl!

808
02:18:44,365 --> 02:18:45,923
You know, l'm worried.

809
02:18:46,133 --> 02:18:49,660
Eight thousand miles from home,
my cameraman's mind has gone to mush...

810
02:18:49,737 --> 02:18:51,864
...on some whacked-out water diet!

811
02:18:51,939 --> 02:18:53,600
l know what l saw.

812
02:18:54,475 --> 02:18:57,035
l know you did, and l believe you.

813
02:18:57,845 --> 02:19:00,837
Page 4. Any problem with the setup?

814
02:19:25,172 --> 02:19:29,472
Here's your prescription, Grizzy,
take them after a meal.

815
02:20:34,608 --> 02:20:36,599
My man! What's happening!

816
02:20:36,677 --> 02:20:38,269
My buddy!

817
02:20:38,345 --> 02:20:40,540
Bad man of the Cougars!
How are you doing?

818
02:20:42,549 --> 02:20:45,450
Astonishing. ls that the normal
greeting in your country?

819
02:20:45,519 --> 02:20:48,716
lt's called a ''high five.'' Try it.
l'm Vic Casey.

820
02:20:49,223 --> 02:20:53,887
Welcome to Tigora, Mr. Casey.
l'm King Jabalani.

821
02:20:54,595 --> 02:20:57,120
Oh, Jesus. Excuse me.

822
02:20:58,032 --> 02:21:00,193
l found it tingling and delightful.

823
02:21:03,971 --> 02:21:06,940
Our intended bride, Princess Zanda.

824
02:21:16,183 --> 02:21:17,616
Cool!

825
02:21:18,018 --> 02:21:20,145
Please follow us, Mr. Casey.

826
02:21:20,954 --> 02:21:23,252
Fletch, get the bags, will you?

827
02:21:38,005 --> 02:21:40,132
What's wrong? Are you lost?

828
02:21:41,942 --> 02:21:44,968
l am not. Do l look lost?

829
02:21:45,713 --> 02:21:47,681
You look like a Zambuli.

830
02:21:48,615 --> 02:21:51,812
That is true. l am their shaman.

831
02:21:52,753 --> 02:21:55,517
l have journeyed many days to Azan.

832
02:21:56,023 --> 02:21:58,014
Where do l find the king?

833
02:21:58,692 --> 02:22:00,489
So you want the king?

834
02:22:03,197 --> 02:22:07,258
l've told you that already. Take me to him.

835
02:22:09,336 --> 02:22:11,201
You're coming with us.

836
02:22:54,214 --> 02:22:58,014
You would prefer the head of the table
for yourself, dear brother?

837
02:23:00,487 --> 02:23:01,852
Not at all.

838
02:23:06,894 --> 02:23:09,727
l have heard a strange rumor.

839
02:23:11,632 --> 02:23:15,625
The cellar of the Grand Hotel
has armed guests.

840
02:23:15,702 --> 02:23:17,260
Extremely strange.

841
02:23:17,838 --> 02:23:20,238
You think someone's planning
a revolution?

842
02:23:21,575 --> 02:23:25,807
l think it would be very wise
if you were to look into this.

843
02:23:33,987 --> 02:23:36,820
Why are you here? You know it's not safe.

844
02:23:38,492 --> 02:23:41,222
Mary, run to the Grand Hotel.

845
02:23:41,562 --> 02:23:45,259
Tell Colonel Jorgenson l said
to keep his head down for a few hours.

846
02:23:45,332 --> 02:23:46,162
Yes, Sir.

847
02:23:46,233 --> 02:23:48,224
He's discovered something?

848
02:23:48,635 --> 02:23:51,297
Nothing serious. Relax.

849
02:23:57,477 --> 02:24:00,640
Did you hear the Zambuli shaman
has come to town?

850
02:24:01,582 --> 02:24:05,279
Of course l've heard. l've had her arrested.

851
02:24:05,686 --> 02:24:09,986
Are you crazy? Why?
What if Jabalani finds out?

852
02:24:10,958 --> 02:24:12,289
He never will.

853
02:24:16,630 --> 02:24:18,291
A Zambuli Bow.

854
02:24:20,667 --> 02:24:25,104
A dead king.
And a Zambuli shaman to hang for it!

855
02:24:30,510 --> 02:24:32,410
What could be neater?

856
02:24:40,153 --> 02:24:41,450
You're pretty good.

857
02:24:41,722 --> 02:24:47,592
You're so wrong.
l am the most wicked woman in Tigora.

858
02:25:18,358 --> 02:25:19,347
Marika!

859
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:33,635
l can't believe it!
Dinner at the palace, right?

860
02:25:33,707 --> 02:25:35,504
l'm supposed to have cheese today.

861
02:25:35,575 --> 02:25:37,839
l bet they have breadfruit and lasagna.

862
02:25:37,911 --> 02:25:39,503
Be good for you.

863
02:25:40,981 --> 02:25:44,712
Excellent preventative
against seeing imaginary blondes!

864
02:25:47,087 --> 02:25:50,784
l'm telling you she was not imaginary!
l know a girl when l see one!

865
02:25:50,857 --> 02:25:54,418
What was she doing in the jungle?
Her junior year abroad?

866
02:25:58,665 --> 02:26:00,656
We missed our floor.

867
02:26:04,838 --> 02:26:09,298
Tell me again. At the airport
you saw a helicopter gunship?

868
02:26:10,711 --> 02:26:16,547
No! Our story is about a guy
who kicks 60-yard field goals...

869
02:26:16,616 --> 02:26:19,107
...and his brother is a king. That's it!

870
02:26:34,868 --> 02:26:37,632
Center pic. Good, hold it there.

871
02:26:38,071 --> 02:26:40,164
Higher up. Good.

872
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:43,409
Right, come on, Fletch, follow the pigs.

873
02:26:46,580 --> 02:26:49,174
Watch the boobs
coming into the right of your frame.

874
02:26:49,249 --> 02:26:51,046
Boobs? What kind of talk is that?

875
02:26:51,118 --> 02:26:55,179
As in tits. Zanda, the king's sweetie.
We're for network, remember?

876
02:26:55,255 --> 02:26:58,622
l see what you mean!
Boy, do l see what you mean!

877
02:27:07,901 --> 02:27:09,198
Okay, follow the pigs.

878
02:27:16,176 --> 02:27:18,872
-Jammed!
-Clear it, l need this shot!

879
02:27:18,945 --> 02:27:20,936
A toast, dear friends.

880
02:27:21,515 --> 02:27:25,542
A toast to our beloved brother,
Prince Otwani.

881
02:27:28,955 --> 02:27:32,322
May his exploits with his royal foot...

882
02:27:32,893 --> 02:27:38,854
...lead him to that curious American glory,
which l confess, puzzles me completely...

883
02:27:41,368 --> 02:27:42,357
-Got it.
-Go.

884
02:27:44,104 --> 02:27:46,004
...''Superbowl champions''!

885
02:27:58,618 --> 02:28:00,848
Give me another magazine, quick!

886
02:28:03,290 --> 02:28:06,748
Take this to the lab!
Start it through the soup, go on!

887
02:28:12,632 --> 02:28:14,224
A Zambuli arrow!

888
02:28:25,512 --> 02:28:28,572
lt's a Zambuli woman.
We caught her with a bow.

889
02:28:33,954 --> 02:28:37,390
No, Otwani! You are the king now.

890
02:28:39,593 --> 02:28:42,027
You are quite right, Princess Zanda.

891
02:28:44,231 --> 02:28:46,699
We'll leave her to the hangman.

892
02:28:48,802 --> 02:28:51,270
Nairobi, Capetown....

893
02:28:52,072 --> 02:28:53,835
Okay, that's got it.

894
02:28:54,474 --> 02:28:58,171
l don't give a damn,
just tell me where l can rent a Learjet!

895
02:28:59,513 --> 02:29:01,606
Baby, you are talking to a man in pain.

896
02:29:01,681 --> 02:29:04,377
l am sitting on an Emmy
and l can't get it out!

897
02:29:04,451 --> 02:29:07,614
-You know what that means?
-Sounds like he needs a laxative!

898
02:29:08,121 --> 02:29:10,248
Here's the piece
where the camera jammed.

899
02:29:10,323 --> 02:29:12,917
No, 86 that, it was off the action.

900
02:29:13,093 --> 02:29:15,891
Look at it first.
There might be a good frame or two.

901
02:29:15,962 --> 02:29:17,589
Look at it first.

902
02:29:18,999 --> 02:29:20,762
What is this?

903
02:29:22,836 --> 02:29:25,771
l don't know.
Let's look at it on the viewer.

904
02:29:26,473 --> 02:29:28,907
Vic, take a look at this.

905
02:29:33,313 --> 02:29:34,780
Right down in there.

906
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:41,112
Well, whatever it is, it's in a tree.
Look. There's the branch.

907
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:45,158
l'll run it ahead a bit.

908
02:29:46,893 --> 02:29:49,691
Now, what's that line going across there?

909
02:29:49,963 --> 02:29:51,658
Looks like a scratch.

910
02:29:52,666 --> 02:29:55,794
That's no scratch,
it's an arrow coming out of that tree...

911
02:29:55,869 --> 02:29:59,134
...going in just the right direction
to kill the king.

912
02:30:00,574 --> 02:30:04,203
And that is a steel crossbow firing it.

913
02:30:04,711 --> 02:30:07,145
And that's not a Zambuli bow, for sure!

914
02:30:07,480 --> 02:30:11,109
Jesus, kid, if you're right,
you just got your union card!

915
02:30:11,685 --> 02:30:14,176
''Top of the news,'' the man says.
''Dan Rather time.''

916
02:30:14,554 --> 02:30:18,923
We could get killed doing this!
l'm talking about bullets through the head!

917
02:30:18,992 --> 02:30:21,017
Let's just turn around and go back.

918
02:30:21,094 --> 02:30:25,394
All right, Fletch, you're absolutely right.
First plane in the morning, l promise.

919
02:30:25,632 --> 02:30:29,568
l want to interview that Zambuli woman
they've got locked in jail first.

920
02:30:29,869 --> 02:30:32,633
Not only is he suicidal, he's crazy!

921
02:30:32,706 --> 02:30:36,107
They're not going to let us
just walk up in there, you know.

922
02:30:36,176 --> 02:30:37,666
l have a pass.

923
02:30:38,178 --> 02:30:40,078
A what? Let me see it!

924
02:31:04,904 --> 02:31:06,599
What are you waiting for?

925
02:31:08,675 --> 02:31:11,200
-The battery has gone dead!
-Too bad!

926
02:31:11,278 --> 02:31:15,715
We'll start with an establishing shot,
then l want to zoom in on the gate.

927
02:31:50,617 --> 02:31:54,485
Back when we played ''doctor,''
that's what we called a girl. A blonde!

928
02:31:54,554 --> 02:31:57,421
Fletch, l apologize! Roll, roll it!

929
02:34:17,330 --> 02:34:20,094
-Vic, that's jungle up ahead.
-Sure looks like it.

930
02:34:20,166 --> 02:34:22,634
l'm a city boy.
l get paranoid going to zoos!

931
02:34:22,769 --> 02:34:24,361
Close your eyes.

932
02:34:49,629 --> 02:34:51,358
We are ready to go.

933
02:34:52,298 --> 02:34:55,665
Mission: Find and kill!

934
02:34:56,035 --> 02:34:59,436
lt's your neck if that shaman lives to talk.

935
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:04,442
And ditto for Mr. Casey
if he's made contact and got her story.

936
02:35:05,078 --> 02:35:06,909
Consider them dead.

937
02:35:07,881 --> 02:35:09,542
And the girl.

938
02:35:09,616 --> 02:35:12,710
l want to see her alive.
She sounds interesting.

939
02:35:12,819 --> 02:35:15,845
Not to me! You will kill her on sight,
Colonel Jorgenson!

940
02:35:15,955 --> 02:35:20,585
Cool it! No women's lib stuff around here,
l give the orders!

941
02:35:20,660 --> 02:35:23,458
With them finished,
it's on to Gudjara full speed.

942
02:36:01,434 --> 02:36:02,628
What's wrong?

943
02:36:03,069 --> 02:36:04,434
Hoof prints.

944
02:36:07,974 --> 02:36:09,669
Running, l think.

945
02:36:11,744 --> 02:36:15,874
-How many toes has a zebra got, if any?
-He thinks he's the Last of the Mohicans!

946
02:36:15,949 --> 02:36:20,477
l could sue you for kidnapping
and you're bugging me about zebra toes?

947
02:36:20,553 --> 02:36:21,520
All right!

948
02:36:22,221 --> 02:36:25,554
l admit we have as much chance
of finding her here as a McDonalds.

949
02:36:25,625 --> 02:36:30,085
But Fletch, we both saw her.
And while there's hope....

950
02:36:52,285 --> 02:36:54,776
Nice kitty, nice.

951
02:36:58,925 --> 02:36:59,914
Heel.

952
02:37:02,829 --> 02:37:04,456
Make that plural.

953
02:37:10,637 --> 02:37:12,161
Your friends?

954
02:37:31,057 --> 02:37:32,786
Do you want to die?

955
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:35,056
No.

956
02:37:35,294 --> 02:37:40,163
Then go back! Tell the rest of your evil,
killing tribe not to hunt us!

957
02:37:45,905 --> 02:37:48,806
You will remain here
to be sure he obeys me.

958
02:37:49,242 --> 02:37:50,470
Get out!

959
02:37:51,844 --> 02:37:53,471
l don't think so.

960
02:38:18,404 --> 02:38:19,769
They understand you?

961
02:38:20,339 --> 02:38:21,670
Of course!

962
02:38:22,975 --> 02:38:24,374
Who are you?

963
02:38:28,081 --> 02:38:29,480
l am Sheena.

964
02:38:36,656 --> 02:38:38,180
l'm Vic Casey.

965
02:38:39,058 --> 02:38:42,152
l cold-cocked that guard
when he was about to shoot you.

966
02:38:42,228 --> 02:38:44,093
Remember?

967
02:39:43,856 --> 02:39:47,155
You will be safe inside the circle.
Do not cross it.

968
02:39:47,994 --> 02:39:49,791
Kibor, you stay here!

969
02:39:52,098 --> 02:39:54,089
Hey, where are you going?

970
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:09,812
Who is that girl?

971
02:40:13,753 --> 02:40:15,050
You okay?

972
02:40:15,555 --> 02:40:16,715
Where are we?

973
02:40:16,789 --> 02:40:18,518
Central Park. Why?

974
02:40:22,562 --> 02:40:25,122
Thank God. l thought l was....

975
02:40:27,133 --> 02:40:29,533
We really have to do something
about this park!

976
02:40:29,602 --> 02:40:31,832
lt's getting worse all the time.

977
02:40:43,616 --> 02:40:46,744
Your hand, it's so cold.

978
02:40:47,687 --> 02:40:49,985
The flame departs.

979
02:40:55,094 --> 02:40:56,618
Don't leave me.

980
02:40:57,296 --> 02:41:02,427
l must, daughter.
My time is done, as yours is beginning.

981
02:41:03,336 --> 02:41:04,928
lt was foretold.

982
02:41:05,905 --> 02:41:10,137
Sheena will protect the Zambulis
at a time of great trouble.

983
02:41:11,377 --> 02:41:13,743
She'll guard the sacred mountain...

984
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:17,113
...from the men
who would tear out its riches.

985
02:41:17,783 --> 02:41:22,516
How? What can one woman do
against a man so strong...

986
02:41:22,588 --> 02:41:24,647
...so evil as Otwani?

987
02:41:35,501 --> 02:41:39,733
You're not alone.
l see a friend at your side.

988
02:41:40,573 --> 02:41:43,906
Who? How will l know who it is?

989
02:41:45,511 --> 02:41:47,411
How does one ever know?

990
02:41:48,848 --> 02:41:52,249
You'll look at his eyes. You'll see.

991
02:41:54,186 --> 02:41:55,778
You must go now.

992
02:41:56,555 --> 02:41:59,046
Leave me in the home
Chango has made for me.

993
02:41:59,725 --> 02:42:02,353
Shaman. Mother.

994
02:42:03,462 --> 02:42:08,297
How soft, my daughter,
how pleasing to me.

995
02:42:08,801 --> 02:42:12,293
Your tears upon me,
to extinguish the last embers.

996
02:42:13,472 --> 02:42:16,498
My Sheena, my queen.

997
02:43:04,390 --> 02:43:07,826
This is amazing!
lt even keeps the mosquitoes out!

998
02:43:29,348 --> 02:43:32,840
Now tell me. Why did you follow us?

999
02:43:34,253 --> 02:43:38,155
We're storytellers, with pictures, too.

1000
02:43:38,791 --> 02:43:41,521
And, baby, have we got a story here!

1001
02:43:41,961 --> 02:43:45,294
Take me to that Zambuli woman
you busted out of jail.

1002
02:43:46,198 --> 02:43:49,258
The shaman? You want to see her?

1003
02:43:49,835 --> 02:43:52,702
Yes, you see l know she didn't kill the king.

1004
02:43:52,905 --> 02:43:57,842
Let me carry her own words home with me
and l can prove it to the whole world.

1005
02:43:57,910 --> 02:43:59,844
You must think l'm a fool.

1006
02:44:00,079 --> 02:44:01,774
Words are like the wind.

1007
02:44:01,847 --> 02:44:03,974
They cannot be carried home.

1008
02:44:04,850 --> 02:44:06,044
They can.

1009
02:44:06,118 --> 02:44:09,747
You must think I'm a fool.
Words are like the wind.

1010
02:44:10,022 --> 02:44:11,785
They cannot be carried home.

1011
02:44:14,060 --> 02:44:15,254
lt bugs me, too.

1012
02:44:15,327 --> 02:44:18,785
Listen, why don't you just take him
to your shammie...your shaman?

1013
02:44:21,967 --> 02:44:23,764
She's gone far ahead.

1014
02:44:24,804 --> 02:44:27,170
You will have to take a long journey
with me.

1015
02:44:28,174 --> 02:44:29,198
l'd love to.

1016
02:44:30,176 --> 02:44:33,634
He sneaks back to Azan
to ship out some film we left there.

1017
02:44:33,979 --> 02:44:37,142
-l go with you.
-l like it!

1018
02:44:38,584 --> 02:44:39,983
Anybody object?

1019
02:44:55,468 --> 02:44:56,765
There is danger!

1020
02:45:23,229 --> 02:45:26,357
Come on, let's go! Get in here!

1021
02:45:29,935 --> 02:45:31,402
Get the film!

1022
02:46:00,699 --> 02:46:01,688
Shit!

1023
02:46:30,563 --> 02:46:31,723
Climb.

1024
02:46:38,270 --> 02:46:40,067
Come on, Vic Casey.

1025
02:47:44,703 --> 02:47:45,692
Colonel...

1026
02:47:46,505 --> 02:47:49,872
...somebody slipped.
Yeah, he fell right here.

1027
02:47:50,509 --> 02:47:52,033
Did they go on?

1028
02:47:52,578 --> 02:47:53,806
l'm not sure.

1029
02:47:53,879 --> 02:47:56,279
Find out.
That's what you're being paid for.

1030
02:48:31,750 --> 02:48:36,119
-l asked you, did they go on?
-l already told you. l'm not sure.

1031
02:48:37,723 --> 02:48:38,712
All right.

1032
02:48:40,626 --> 02:48:43,424
We hike back to the vehicles.

1033
02:48:52,905 --> 02:48:55,237
We sure handled that okay.

1034
02:49:42,321 --> 02:49:46,348
Fletch, you shouldn't be in Azan.
They are looking for you!

1035
02:49:46,425 --> 02:49:49,861
l know.
They were at the lab a half-hour ago.

1036
02:49:50,696 --> 02:49:53,529
-You're probably going to be next!
-What?

1037
02:49:56,235 --> 02:49:58,294
How many have l had now? Let's see...

1038
02:49:58,370 --> 02:50:02,670
...three, no, l had six, seven....
l am going insane!

1039
02:50:02,741 --> 02:50:04,402
What is happening?

1040
02:50:13,519 --> 02:50:16,249
All right, Juka, you did it, you got it!

1041
02:50:16,321 --> 02:50:19,119
The village where l was born
is only a few miles away.

1042
02:50:19,224 --> 02:50:21,055
We'll be safe there.

1043
02:50:21,193 --> 02:50:23,525
-Where is Vic?
-Don't ask!

1044
02:51:19,251 --> 02:51:23,051
Why don't you come in and wash?
You're as dirty as a wart hog!

1045
02:51:26,291 --> 02:51:28,088
No, l don't think so.

1046
02:51:29,261 --> 02:51:31,024
Water frightens you?

1047
02:51:32,798 --> 02:51:34,663
Well, no, not exactly.

1048
02:51:39,004 --> 02:51:41,973
Come in, Vic Casey, the water is cold!

1049
02:51:43,542 --> 02:51:45,840
lt's so good for you!

1050
02:51:47,112 --> 02:51:49,307
Remove those strange skins you wear.

1051
02:51:51,783 --> 02:51:53,808
From what animal do they come?

1052
02:51:54,152 --> 02:51:57,246
The wild silk moth.
lt roams in Bloomingdale's.

1053
02:52:01,093 --> 02:52:04,824
-Fur! You have fur!
-l have what?

1054
02:52:05,364 --> 02:52:09,960
The Zambuli men do not have fur
on their bodies. This cannot be.

1055
02:52:15,541 --> 02:52:17,907
Would you go back in the water, please?

1056
02:52:18,443 --> 02:52:19,501
Why?

1057
02:52:37,563 --> 02:52:40,259
Red One to Hawk One, do you copy?

1058
02:52:44,870 --> 02:52:46,804
Hawk One copies Red One, over.

1059
02:52:47,105 --> 02:52:48,697
How's it coming?

1060
02:52:50,909 --> 02:52:51,898
Very good. Over.

1061
02:52:52,945 --> 02:52:54,879
What l want to hear is, ''Very soon.''

1062
02:53:28,680 --> 02:53:30,807
We will be safe here for a while.

1063
02:53:30,882 --> 02:53:33,407
They would never believe
you could run over such rocks.

1064
02:53:33,485 --> 02:53:37,012
-Me?
-Of course. They know l can run anywhere.

1065
02:53:47,132 --> 02:53:49,999
Difficult on their feet.
l think we catch them now.

1066
02:53:54,272 --> 02:53:55,261
Wadman.

1067
02:53:55,340 --> 02:53:58,673
-What's the matter?
-Nothing is the matter. Tracks.

1068
02:54:02,381 --> 02:54:04,872
Zebra, deep.

1069
02:54:06,318 --> 02:54:09,253
-Must be carrying a heavy load.
-Somebody riding it, you mean?

1070
02:54:09,321 --> 02:54:10,310
Yeah.

1071
02:54:11,623 --> 02:54:13,614
-Maybe two people.
-Good.

1072
02:54:14,092 --> 02:54:15,354
Let's go!

1073
02:54:27,606 --> 02:54:30,973
Your hair smells fantastic!
What did you wash it with?

1074
02:54:31,043 --> 02:54:33,978
Zam Zam berries!
What else would a woman use?

1075
02:54:34,579 --> 02:54:36,206
Are your feet better now?

1076
02:54:36,281 --> 02:54:39,739
l think it's just possible
l might walk again sometime.

1077
02:54:40,452 --> 02:54:42,249
Sometime very soon.

1078
02:54:47,459 --> 02:54:51,793
Rest, Marika. Eat.
l will summon you again soon. Go ahead.

1079
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:56,167
Come on, Vic Casey.

1080
02:55:04,476 --> 02:55:07,673
The dry season.
They cannot find anything to eat.

1081
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:11,471
That big one in front, he's looking at me.

1082
02:55:12,284 --> 02:55:15,310
That's a cow, Vic Casey.
All the big ones are cows.

1083
02:55:15,387 --> 02:55:18,049
They wouldn't eat you
if you were the last thing on earth.

1084
02:55:18,123 --> 02:55:20,717
Sheena, where did you learn all this?

1085
02:55:21,593 --> 02:55:24,687
Shaman taught me.
She told me everything.

1086
02:55:26,832 --> 02:55:28,163
l'm sorry.

1087
02:55:30,102 --> 02:55:31,262
Sorry?

1088
02:55:34,106 --> 02:55:38,167
l sat up last night.
You talked in your sleep.

1089
02:55:38,944 --> 02:55:40,468
l know she's gone.

1090
02:55:41,913 --> 02:55:44,814
Then why do you still travel with me?

1091
02:55:44,883 --> 02:55:48,785
You said it was to find the shaman,
to catch her words in your box.

1092
02:55:48,854 --> 02:55:51,152
l did want to. That was the truth.

1093
02:55:52,290 --> 02:55:54,758
But since then, l've found other reasons.

1094
02:55:54,993 --> 02:55:56,654
Say what you mean.

1095
02:55:57,729 --> 02:55:59,594
lt's called chemistry.

1096
02:55:59,664 --> 02:56:03,657
Say what you mean. Stop using words
you know l do not understand.

1097
02:56:15,447 --> 02:56:17,347
Do you understand that?

1098
02:56:18,450 --> 02:56:19,439
No.

1099
02:56:21,019 --> 02:56:25,513
Mouths were given us to eat with.
Why did you touch yours to mine?

1100
02:56:54,920 --> 02:56:57,912
There's your 10,
and l'll raise you 10 more.

1101
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:04,695
Sorry, Gramps. Queens full.

1102
02:57:04,796 --> 02:57:08,232
You lose!
Mombassa straight beat full house.

1103
02:57:09,367 --> 02:57:10,732
This pile of junk?

1104
02:57:10,802 --> 02:57:15,762
All red color!
One jack, rest of cards all even number.

1105
02:57:16,007 --> 02:57:17,668
Mombassa straight!

1106
02:57:24,749 --> 02:57:28,207
Otwani has cut the long lines.
No calls outside Tigora.

1107
02:57:28,687 --> 02:57:31,315
-And the airports?
-Closed. No airplanes.

1108
02:57:31,723 --> 02:57:35,625
But the bastards are working awful hard
to fix the gun-chopper.

1109
02:57:36,261 --> 02:57:37,421
Jesus!

1110
02:57:38,330 --> 02:57:39,319
Vic!

1111
02:57:43,969 --> 02:57:46,597
These Zambulis of yours,
do they have guns?

1112
02:57:47,038 --> 02:57:49,939
Never! Guns are bad. Arrows!

1113
02:57:50,575 --> 02:57:53,408
Against machine guns?
Against armored cars?

1114
02:57:54,279 --> 02:57:58,272
A thousand, thousand moons ago,
they were the greatest of all warriors.

1115
02:57:58,350 --> 02:58:01,581
Before She-Who-ls-Unknown
brought peace to every creature.

1116
02:58:01,653 --> 02:58:02,779
lt is told!

1117
02:58:06,024 --> 02:58:07,719
You make me want to cry.

1118
02:58:08,894 --> 02:58:10,156
For what?

1119
02:58:10,962 --> 02:58:12,554
Just everything.

1120
02:58:18,403 --> 02:58:20,963
These are good. We'll eat here.

1121
02:58:21,806 --> 02:58:23,398
We need strength.

1122
02:58:40,325 --> 02:58:43,089
Tiki saw something. Wait here.

1123
02:58:47,165 --> 02:58:48,154
Sheena.

1124
02:58:49,834 --> 02:58:51,461
Look through these.

1125
02:58:52,270 --> 02:58:53,931
Try them, they're magic.

1126
02:58:58,376 --> 02:59:01,436
Bad magic!
They've made you into a pygmy!

1127
02:59:02,314 --> 02:59:03,975
Try the other end.

1128
02:59:11,489 --> 02:59:14,117
Vic Casey, you are a giant!

1129
02:59:15,327 --> 02:59:16,794
Occasionally.

1130
03:00:28,099 --> 03:00:29,623
We'll blow it up!

1131
03:00:29,901 --> 03:00:33,132
All right, get some plastics
and blow the damned thing up!

1132
03:00:34,739 --> 03:00:36,468
Chango has stopped them.

1133
03:00:37,509 --> 03:00:39,306
The soldier wagons drink water.

1134
03:00:39,377 --> 03:00:42,642
-Gasoline. How far back?
-An hour's running.

1135
03:00:42,747 --> 03:00:46,342
-An hour's running for you or me?
-You.

1136
03:00:46,751 --> 03:00:49,914
That's way too close.
Come on, we have to get out of here.

1137
03:00:50,889 --> 03:00:53,619
All right, get behind the vehicles. Move!

1138
03:01:08,740 --> 03:01:11,504
Fletch, you are drinking
from two glasses now?

1139
03:01:12,377 --> 03:01:15,437
That's right,
because there's two of me to get smashed!

1140
03:01:15,513 --> 03:01:17,208
-Two of you?
-Yeah.

1141
03:01:17,982 --> 03:01:21,941
Fletch Number 1: he says,
''Go on up to Central Park, find Vic!''

1142
03:01:22,554 --> 03:01:25,182
Fletch Number 2:
he says, ''To hell with that fool.

1143
03:01:25,256 --> 03:01:29,454
''Walk across the border,
get the film out and get myself an Emmy.''

1144
03:01:31,429 --> 03:01:32,418
Cheers.

1145
03:01:35,433 --> 03:01:37,833
-How many have l had now?
-Fletch Number 1...

1146
03:01:37,902 --> 03:01:42,805
...if you want to go up into the park,
l know the greatest tracker in Tigora.

1147
03:01:42,874 --> 03:01:45,672
l don't.
l'd rather jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.

1148
03:01:50,215 --> 03:01:51,375
Where is he?

1149
03:03:17,068 --> 03:03:18,365
This is murder!

1150
03:03:18,636 --> 03:03:23,505
These thorn trees are our friends.
They will let us rest for the night in safety.

1151
03:03:24,576 --> 03:03:25,907
What do you mean?

1152
03:03:26,244 --> 03:03:28,735
The soldier wagons
must come through here.

1153
03:03:28,813 --> 03:03:32,010
Their round rubber feet
will be wrecked to pieces.

1154
03:03:41,092 --> 03:03:42,787
This forest ends soon.

1155
03:03:45,763 --> 03:03:49,961
We will be at the Lake of Birds.
The Zambuli lands begin there.

1156
03:04:02,013 --> 03:04:05,505
Across those hills is Z'Kuru,
the first Zambuli village.

1157
03:04:06,050 --> 03:04:09,110
My feet will be swifter
when they're back on the sacred land.

1158
03:04:09,187 --> 03:04:11,417
You must be kidding! Swifter?

1159
03:04:12,290 --> 03:04:13,882
Such beauty!

1160
03:04:15,026 --> 03:04:16,357
Beyond belief.

1161
03:04:17,829 --> 03:04:20,354
l have been here at sunset 100 times.

1162
03:04:21,199 --> 03:04:23,759
And it has never moved me
as it does tonight.

1163
03:04:26,237 --> 03:04:29,206
-Shall l tell you why?
-Please.

1164
03:04:29,274 --> 03:04:31,970
l am not a foolish young girl, Vic Casey.

1165
03:04:32,310 --> 03:04:36,644
The shaman taught me that brave tales
do not always have happy endings.

1166
03:04:37,015 --> 03:04:38,983
l know what guns can do.

1167
03:04:39,917 --> 03:04:43,080
l know that you and l may not live
to see another sunset.

1168
03:04:55,733 --> 03:04:58,429
-You are an enemy.
-l'm what?

1169
03:04:59,771 --> 03:05:01,534
The shaman taught me.

1170
03:05:02,006 --> 03:05:04,440
An enemy is one
who takes without asking.

1171
03:05:06,010 --> 03:05:08,945
l'll ask then. May l?

1172
03:05:14,185 --> 03:05:15,243
Yes.

1173
03:06:04,736 --> 03:06:07,534
Hold it!

1174
03:06:09,974 --> 03:06:11,635
Refuel!

1175
03:06:15,646 --> 03:06:17,204
What's going on here?

1176
03:06:19,550 --> 03:06:22,178
These men got dragged
through the thorn trees!

1177
03:06:24,155 --> 03:06:25,884
So bury them!

1178
03:06:33,131 --> 03:06:35,122
lt was a tiring night.

1179
03:06:37,435 --> 03:06:39,596
The morale of the men is not good.

1180
03:06:40,638 --> 03:06:45,200
-A little killing is going to cheer them up.
-l don't understand.

1181
03:06:45,276 --> 03:06:47,073
We're in Zambuli territory.

1182
03:06:47,578 --> 03:06:50,069
Z'Kuru, next village. We hit it!

1183
03:06:51,182 --> 03:06:53,912
Their direct line of flight to Gudjara is here.

1184
03:06:55,153 --> 03:06:57,417
Z'Kuru is off to the side.

1185
03:06:57,522 --> 03:07:00,423
l don't care! We zap Z'Kuru!

1186
03:07:01,292 --> 03:07:04,659
Now, the message goes ahead
by the jungle telegraph.

1187
03:07:05,463 --> 03:07:09,695
Those Zambulis up in Gudjara
won't stop running till they hit Cairo!

1188
03:07:12,136 --> 03:07:13,728
lt is good psychology.

1189
03:07:15,440 --> 03:07:17,340
lt is good for the men.

1190
03:07:18,342 --> 03:07:21,140
Looks like you're going to enjoy it,
too, Jorgie.

1191
03:07:24,182 --> 03:07:25,444
Oh, yeah.

1192
03:07:29,086 --> 03:07:31,179
You will be made welcome in Z'Kuru.

1193
03:07:31,255 --> 03:07:35,055
The headman's locust-bean cakes,
they'll be your locust-bean cakes.

1194
03:07:35,827 --> 03:07:39,058
His fermented buffalo milk
will be your fermented buffalo milk.

1195
03:07:39,130 --> 03:07:42,156
-His week-old dried--
-Please, l'm eating!

1196
03:07:43,701 --> 03:07:46,693
l will speak to the men
of the time of arrows.

1197
03:07:46,804 --> 03:07:49,739
We will take our bows
and attack the soldier wagons!

1198
03:07:51,776 --> 03:07:54,301
-What was that?
-An earthquake, maybe.

1199
03:07:55,613 --> 03:07:57,342
The land roars at Otwani.

1200
03:08:18,069 --> 03:08:20,367
-No!
-Let me see!

1201
03:09:08,119 --> 03:09:11,577
We'll beat the bastards to Gudjara
somehow and sound a warning.

1202
03:09:12,590 --> 03:09:15,218
lt's the only way to save their lives.

1203
03:09:29,840 --> 03:09:32,035
How can fire burn so hot?

1204
03:09:33,444 --> 03:09:36,140
How can even stone pots
be made into ashes?

1205
03:09:40,418 --> 03:09:43,512
Gas, probably. Gasoline.

1206
03:09:46,791 --> 03:09:48,520
You spoke of that before.

1207
03:09:49,927 --> 03:09:51,724
The water the wagons drink.

1208
03:10:07,311 --> 03:10:09,040
You are wrong, Vic Casey.

1209
03:10:10,281 --> 03:10:13,409
Warning is not the only way
to save people's lives!

1210
03:10:13,951 --> 03:10:15,441
What else can we do?

1211
03:10:15,886 --> 03:10:17,217
Stop Otwani!

1212
03:10:18,756 --> 03:10:19,745
Come!

1213
03:10:34,338 --> 03:10:36,932
Here's one with the sap dripping out.

1214
03:10:45,616 --> 03:10:47,106
Make flame.

1215
03:10:53,290 --> 03:10:54,621
Good.

1216
03:10:55,426 --> 03:10:58,759
You shape this with your blade.
l'll make fire grass.

1217
03:11:21,552 --> 03:11:24,919
-lt is a good arrow.
-Yes, but it's front-heavy.

1218
03:11:28,225 --> 03:11:30,250
Yes, by three fingers.

1219
03:11:35,700 --> 03:11:37,065
They're coming!

1220
03:11:59,457 --> 03:12:03,450
lt's the third truck from the front.
The one with the iron drums.

1221
03:12:04,195 --> 03:12:06,959
l see it. Get your flame ready.

1222
03:12:22,179 --> 03:12:23,168
Light it!

1223
03:12:58,849 --> 03:13:00,749
My God, you've done it!

1224
03:14:10,855 --> 03:14:13,050
Red One!

1225
03:14:13,724 --> 03:14:15,988
They're on the ridge! Go get them!

1226
03:15:13,183 --> 03:15:15,811
-lt's circling away!
-For a better shot at us!

1227
03:15:15,886 --> 03:15:17,877
What do we do, Vic Casey?

1228
03:15:17,955 --> 03:15:21,322
The smart thing would be
to stand up and wave this.

1229
03:15:21,725 --> 03:15:25,183
Your cloth. lt's magic?
lt destroys the firebird?

1230
03:15:25,529 --> 03:15:27,497
No, it says we give up.

1231
03:15:31,936 --> 03:15:34,996
We can make it to those trees down there.
Come on, run!

1232
03:15:58,762 --> 03:16:02,163
Hawk One to Red One.
Red One, what's taking you so long?

1233
03:16:03,067 --> 03:16:05,865
We're tracking them. They're in the trees.

1234
03:16:39,236 --> 03:16:43,332
Marika, warn them! Get them to safety.

1235
03:16:57,254 --> 03:16:58,243
Go!

1236
03:17:08,966 --> 03:17:09,955
Go!

1237
03:17:47,971 --> 03:17:50,405
Wait a minute, l spot their transport!

1238
03:19:28,672 --> 03:19:31,402
l swear to God, l'd do it all over again.

1239
03:19:31,842 --> 03:19:33,434
That pleases me.

1240
03:19:34,378 --> 03:19:37,279
l'm sorry.
There's so much l'd like to show you.

1241
03:19:37,748 --> 03:19:39,079
What would you show me?

1242
03:19:39,149 --> 03:19:42,312
l'd show you the view
of the Trade Towers from my loft.

1243
03:19:42,686 --> 03:19:46,782
When you're walking down Wall Street
at night eating a sack of peanuts.

1244
03:19:47,925 --> 03:19:49,790
Hell, forget them!

1245
03:19:50,294 --> 03:19:54,390
lt is easy, because there is so much
you did show me.

1246
03:20:04,408 --> 03:20:08,276
-Thank you, Vic Casey.
-You're thanking me?

1247
03:20:09,446 --> 03:20:12,677
The fire in my veins tells me l'm still alive.

1248
03:20:13,550 --> 03:20:15,780
l have not failed my people yet!

1249
03:20:23,660 --> 03:20:25,389
lt's pretty amazing.

1250
03:20:25,696 --> 03:20:28,927
You've been on my turf all my life
and l've never met you.

1251
03:20:31,068 --> 03:20:33,559
How have the Zambuli ever hurt you?

1252
03:20:34,271 --> 03:20:35,966
Why do you chain me?

1253
03:20:36,473 --> 03:20:40,273
l'm your king. l can do anything l want.

1254
03:20:41,845 --> 03:20:45,372
-Don't even think of it!
-l'll try not to.

1255
03:20:46,583 --> 03:20:50,917
-What would you do with her?
-She's protector of those savages, no?

1256
03:20:51,755 --> 03:20:53,382
That's her story.

1257
03:20:53,924 --> 03:20:56,119
l would fly her over Gudjara.

1258
03:20:56,827 --> 03:20:59,955
l would drop her
in the great Zambuli Falls...

1259
03:21:00,731 --> 03:21:02,961
...with the whole tribe watching.

1260
03:21:03,900 --> 03:21:06,198
l like your imagination, Zanda.

1261
03:21:06,703 --> 03:21:07,931
You'll do it?

1262
03:21:08,672 --> 03:21:09,900
Sorry.

1263
03:21:11,308 --> 03:21:12,570
Take her away.

1264
03:21:17,514 --> 03:21:19,744
And bring us Mr. Casey.

1265
03:21:30,694 --> 03:21:33,185
You're a hard man to find, Vic, old pal.

1266
03:21:34,197 --> 03:21:37,792
You had it made, you asshole!
And then it got to you.

1267
03:21:38,101 --> 03:21:39,193
Got to me?

1268
03:21:39,403 --> 03:21:43,567
The cheering, the crowds.
The goddamn agents. Guys like me!

1269
03:21:44,474 --> 03:21:46,965
You had so much. You wanted it all.

1270
03:21:49,112 --> 03:21:53,947
Save that for Sunday school, Vic, old pal.
You should've stuck to your game plan.

1271
03:21:54,017 --> 03:21:56,952
When they put the rope around your neck,
you'll wish l had.

1272
03:21:57,020 --> 03:21:58,988
Around my neck?

1273
03:21:59,056 --> 03:22:01,581
Hey, man, it's fourth down and 99 to go.

1274
03:22:01,658 --> 03:22:04,422
You're behind with five seconds
left on the clock.

1275
03:22:04,494 --> 03:22:07,156
The ball bounces funny
in the last two minutes.

1276
03:22:07,230 --> 03:22:09,391
You should see some film l shot.

1277
03:22:10,233 --> 03:22:14,727
-l'll watch Sportsworld very closely.
-lt isn't going to be on Sportsworld.

1278
03:22:14,805 --> 03:22:18,901
l think it'll get a better rating
at the Organization of African States.

1279
03:22:18,975 --> 03:22:23,378
Now, which shot is that?
Me kicking it over the palace roof?

1280
03:22:24,481 --> 03:22:26,449
Opens on a roast pig.

1281
03:22:26,616 --> 03:22:29,949
Segue into a tree, close shot, night.

1282
03:22:30,754 --> 03:22:32,881
Arrow zings from a catapult.

1283
03:22:51,208 --> 03:22:53,403
-Where are you taking me?
-Home!

1284
03:22:58,382 --> 03:23:02,216
We are leaving on a mission at once.
Sealed orders from King Otwani.

1285
03:23:08,859 --> 03:23:11,623
Now, where is this piece of film?

1286
03:23:16,533 --> 03:23:20,765
lf you kill me, that film still goes out.
lt's in Azan in safe hands.

1287
03:23:22,572 --> 03:23:24,096
Do you want a deal?

1288
03:23:35,185 --> 03:23:36,777
What do you propose?

1289
03:23:36,853 --> 03:23:39,686
You sign a treaty to be filed
with the United Nations...

1290
03:23:39,756 --> 03:23:42,247
...giving independence to the Zambulis.

1291
03:23:42,592 --> 03:23:44,389
lt buys you the negative.

1292
03:23:44,461 --> 03:23:47,555
You could be bluffing.
l'd have to see it first.

1293
03:23:47,864 --> 03:23:49,263
That's fair.

1294
03:23:49,766 --> 03:23:54,499
Okay, have someone drive him to Azan.
Bring him back with the film.

1295
03:23:55,105 --> 03:23:56,834
All right, Blau, take him.

1296
03:23:58,842 --> 03:24:03,541
No tricks, old pal.
Remember, l'm holding your jungle queen.

1297
03:24:04,047 --> 03:24:06,140
-That cuts both ways.
-Meaning?

1298
03:24:06,216 --> 03:24:10,050
Meaning anything happens to her
while l'm gone, you bastard, you hang!

1299
03:24:12,889 --> 03:24:14,516
Lucky man.

1300
03:24:15,659 --> 03:24:17,490
l think he scored.

1301
03:24:18,361 --> 03:24:20,625
Any tips for me?

1302
03:24:36,980 --> 03:24:38,470
Jorgenson!

1303
03:24:38,982 --> 03:24:42,782
The film comes back.
Casey's ticket is one-way!

1304
03:24:47,791 --> 03:24:49,190
What the hell....

1305
03:24:53,096 --> 03:24:55,223
l see my death in your eyes.

1306
03:24:55,765 --> 03:24:57,528
Red One to Hawk One.

1307
03:25:01,104 --> 03:25:04,369
lt was an accident.
Did l damage anything?

1308
03:25:09,880 --> 03:25:13,145
You really plan to throw me
into the Zambuli Falls.

1309
03:25:13,817 --> 03:25:15,580
lt won't hurt a bit.

1310
03:25:16,286 --> 03:25:18,516
lt'll be over before you know it.

1311
03:25:23,059 --> 03:25:24,583
My head aches.

1312
03:25:25,462 --> 03:25:27,692
Your firebird makes such a noise.

1313
03:26:36,366 --> 03:26:40,632
Fly over the village.
Bring them all out for the show.

1314
03:27:40,163 --> 03:27:43,564
-They're following us. Back to the falls!
-Wilco.

1315
03:28:20,303 --> 03:28:23,898
Bank to the left so l can push her out!

1316
03:29:10,754 --> 03:29:13,245
-Get us out of here!
-There's no way!

1317
03:30:49,485 --> 03:30:53,444
See? Even in chains we can defeat them!

1318
03:30:55,692 --> 03:30:57,887
Turn your minds back, my people.

1319
03:30:58,595 --> 03:31:02,759
Remember yourselves
a thousand, thousand moons ago!

1320
03:31:05,001 --> 03:31:06,832
Bring your bows!

1321
03:31:39,335 --> 03:31:40,927
Nice melody, huh?

1322
03:31:48,011 --> 03:31:49,000
Get out!

1323
03:31:51,314 --> 03:31:52,303
Leave!

1324
03:32:20,710 --> 03:32:22,268
Chief Haromba.

1325
03:32:34,524 --> 03:32:36,788
This is the edge of the Great Forest.

1326
03:32:36,960 --> 03:32:38,985
We shall wait for them here.

1327
03:33:57,640 --> 03:34:00,507
Now, Tiki, pass the word. Come on!

1328
03:34:08,051 --> 03:34:10,542
Column, halt! Stragglers!

1329
03:34:15,458 --> 03:34:17,790
Let's go get those bastards!

1330
03:34:20,696 --> 03:34:22,664
First, we secure Gudjara.

1331
03:34:22,832 --> 03:34:24,595
Otwani!

1332
03:34:24,667 --> 03:34:28,797
As long as l live,
Gudjara Mountain will not be yours!

1333
03:34:32,742 --> 03:34:34,073
After her!

1334
03:35:53,022 --> 03:35:55,081
-Straight ahead.
-She went off to the left!

1335
03:35:55,158 --> 03:35:57,353
-Straight ahead!
-l said, to the left!

1336
03:36:19,749 --> 03:36:21,740
-Chief Haromba.
-We are ready.

1337
03:36:44,407 --> 03:36:46,204
Hold it!

1338
03:36:51,781 --> 03:36:54,716
Let's get out of this damned forest!
Back up!

1339
03:36:58,921 --> 03:37:00,115
Attack!

1340
03:37:30,419 --> 03:37:33,354
Withdraw! Get them all!

1341
03:39:54,330 --> 03:39:55,319
Marika!

1342
03:40:29,799 --> 03:40:30,788
Z'Kuru!

1343
03:40:39,842 --> 03:40:41,969
l was only following orders.

1344
03:40:42,611 --> 03:40:43,976
For Z'Kuru!

1345
03:43:28,510 --> 03:43:29,602
Vic Casey.

1346
03:43:32,748 --> 03:43:34,477
Don't think about it.

1347
03:43:35,351 --> 03:43:37,080
How did you do?

1348
03:43:37,886 --> 03:43:40,013
They're all gone, dead!

1349
03:43:42,157 --> 03:43:43,488
Great!

1350
03:43:46,495 --> 03:43:48,258
-Me, too.
-No!

1351
03:43:49,531 --> 03:43:53,661
lt's a funny thing about fatal burns....
They say there's no pain.

1352
03:43:56,905 --> 03:43:58,998
You're head is as clear as a bell.

1353
03:44:00,909 --> 03:44:02,536
l've had it, baby.

1354
03:44:03,712 --> 03:44:06,340
And all l can think of to say is, ''Shit!''

1355
03:44:19,962 --> 03:44:24,422
Okay, l got the Mombassa straight,
now this Zambesi flush.

1356
03:44:24,500 --> 03:44:28,197
That's three red cards,
one black deuce and...

1357
03:44:29,104 --> 03:44:31,937
-...a one-eyed jack, right?
-Jack got to be red.

1358
03:44:32,641 --> 03:44:36,270
Otherwise got to have
three cards under nine, add up to....

1359
03:44:41,650 --> 03:44:43,242
Vic!

1360
03:44:44,553 --> 03:44:45,542
No!

1361
03:44:46,355 --> 03:44:48,653
-They're killing Vic!
-No, they're not!

1362
03:44:48,757 --> 03:44:50,918
-They're murdering him!
-No!

1363
03:46:00,996 --> 03:46:03,658
Tell me more about the places
you will show me.

1364
03:46:03,732 --> 03:46:06,223
Where the jackals eat? Twenty-one?

1365
03:46:09,071 --> 03:46:10,902
l've changed my mind.

1366
03:46:11,473 --> 03:46:13,771
You're not seeing any of those places.

1367
03:46:17,713 --> 03:46:20,443
-You mean, you stay here?
-l can't.

1368
03:46:21,216 --> 03:46:24,049
l've got to take this earth home
to be analyzed in a lab.

1369
03:46:24,787 --> 03:46:28,348
Maybe even duplicate it.
lt might even be a cure for cancer.

1370
03:46:29,458 --> 03:46:30,789
Vic Casey.

1371
03:46:32,227 --> 03:46:34,286
l do not understand.

1372
03:46:35,264 --> 03:46:37,824
They'd kill you
if they got their hands on you.

1373
03:46:37,900 --> 03:46:40,368
-Who would kill me?
-All of us!

1374
03:46:40,602 --> 03:46:41,660
You?

1375
03:46:42,638 --> 03:46:43,627
Hey, Vic!

1376
03:46:46,642 --> 03:46:49,372
Boy, are you guys hard to find! 'Morning.

1377
03:46:49,578 --> 03:46:51,443
We'd adore you to death.

1378
03:46:51,513 --> 03:46:55,643
With printed words, with moving pictures
that go through the air...

1379
03:46:55,717 --> 03:46:58,049
...they'd put stiff hides on your feet.

1380
03:46:58,120 --> 03:47:01,886
Listen, Sheena baby, just move
over a little bit so l can get you in the sun.

1381
03:47:01,957 --> 03:47:04,391
-Perfect--
-Let me see that a second.

1382
03:47:04,459 --> 03:47:09,158
lt'll be really grainy when l blow it up....
What the hell are you doing?

1383
03:47:09,231 --> 03:47:11,324
We're talking an Emmy here! $1,000,000!

1384
03:47:11,400 --> 03:47:13,095
Fletch, get out of here!

1385
03:47:14,303 --> 03:47:15,930
A favor.

1386
03:47:22,845 --> 03:47:24,574
Forget the $1,000,000, huh?

1387
03:47:25,681 --> 03:47:28,275
l'll win it back from you
when we play poker!

1388
03:47:37,826 --> 03:47:42,354
lf the world finds out where the healing
earth comes from, this is all gone.

1389
03:47:43,031 --> 03:47:46,330
You, the Zambulis,
everything you've got going here.

1390
03:47:59,448 --> 03:48:01,609
What are you telling me, Vic Casey?

1391
03:48:03,018 --> 03:48:07,114
How much l love you, Sheena.
So much it busts my heart!

1392
03:48:35,550 --> 03:48:37,347
My heart breaks, also.

1393
03:48:39,721 --> 03:48:42,189
Put out the ''Don't Disturb'' sign, will you?

1394
03:48:42,891 --> 03:48:43,880
What?

1395
03:48:44,826 --> 03:48:45,815
Him.

1396
03:48:49,431 --> 03:48:52,195
Tell him we won't be disturbed
for a few hours.

1397
03:49:35,077 --> 03:49:37,272
Will you return, Vic Casey?

1398
03:49:38,647 --> 03:49:41,047
Yes. Say it again.

1399
03:49:42,951 --> 03:49:44,418
I love you.

1400
03:49:46,388 --> 03:49:47,616
Again.

1401
03:49:48,323 --> 03:49:50,814
Must we waste this hour on words?

1402
03:49:51,305 --> 03:49:57,764
