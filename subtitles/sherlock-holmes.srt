2
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,619
Head cocked to the left...

3
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:46,584
partial deafness in ear.

4
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:47,984
First point of attack.

5
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,787
2, throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.

6
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,965
3, got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.

7
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,501
4, finally, dragging left leg.
Fist to patella.

8
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,165
Summary of prognosis,
conscious in 90 seconds.

9
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,069
Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour.

10
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,802
Full faculty recovery, unlikely.

11
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,384
I like the hat.

12
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:25,043
I just picked it up.

13
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:26,984
Did you remember your revolver?

14
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,384
Knew I forgot something.

15
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:31,788
-Thought I'd left the stove on.
-You did.

16
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,222
I think that's quite enough.

17
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,229
You are a doctor, after all.

18
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:45,966
Always nice to see you, Watson.

19
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:50,346
Where's the inspector?

20
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,741
He's getting his troops lined up.

21
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:54,246
That could be all day.

22
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:54,107
Sherlock Holmes.

23
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,606
And his loyal dog.

24
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,545
Tell me, doctor...

25
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:02,513
as a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

26
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,282
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it.

27
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,613
Watson. Don't.

28
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:13,489
Observe.

29
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,264
How did you see that?

30
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:19,796
Because I was looking for it.

31
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,707
Lord Blackwood.

32
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,038
You seem surprised.

33
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:32,747
I'd say the girl deserves your attention
more than he.

34
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,680
Indeed.

35
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,587
I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boy-o.

36
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,721
Good lad.

37
00:05:46,028 --> 00:05:48,155
Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

38
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,890
We've one for the doctor...

39
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,557
and one for the rope.

40
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,536
-Clarkie?
-Sir?

41
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:56,569
This woman needs a hospital
immediately.

42
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,366
Put her in the back of the Moriah.

43
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,735
Right, lads. That's it.

44
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,879
-Right. Pick him up, lads.
-Yes, sir.

45
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:07,982
If you don't mind.

46
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:10,882
Get him out of my sight.

47
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,619
And you were supposed to
wait for my orders.

48
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:24,025
If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse
and chasing a rumor.

49
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,101
Besides, the girl's parents hired me,
not the Yard.

50
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,103
Why they thought you'd require
any assistance is beyond me.

51
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:32,969
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.

52
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,303
Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade.

53
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,106
Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar.

54
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:39,612
Gentlemen.

55
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,010
Cheese.

56
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:12,813
Blackwood hangs tomorrow.
Read all about it.

57
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,855
156 over 80. Very good.

58
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,459
My nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

59
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:26,060
Tell me something.

60
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:28,219
Your new premises...

61
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:29,625
when are you moving in?

62
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,630
I should be in within the week.

63
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:35,168
Cavendish Place.
And there'll be a woman's touch too.

64
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:36,703
-Well, that's marvelous.
-Indeed.

65
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:40,407
Good God.

66
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,468
-That was gunfire.
-No.

67
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:46,740
No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?

68
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,147
My colleague's probably
just putting up a painting.

69
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,514
I'll-- I'll go and check.

70
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,656
-Your colleague--
-Yes?

71
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:57,190
Won't be moving with you, will he?

72
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,494
No, he won't.

73
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,263
Mrs. Hudson.

74
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,992
I won't go in,
not while he's got a gun in his hand.

75
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:07,897
You don't have to. Give me the paper.

76
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,631
What'll I do when you leave, doctor?
He'll have the whole house down.

77
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,672
He just needs another case. That's all.

78
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:15,936
Couldn't you have a longer engagement?

79
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:19,513
I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know,
not in a domestic environment.

80
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:24,186
Thank you, Captain Philips.
Perhaps a nice cup of tea?

81
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,988
-Same time next week.
-Come along, captain.

82
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:30,421
-It's quieter downstairs.
-Mrs. Hudson?

83
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,083
Bring something to cheer him up.

84
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:44,538
Permission to enter the armory?

85
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:45,731
Granted.

86
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:51,669
Watson, I am in the process
of inventing a device...

87
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,838
that suppresses the sound
of a gunshot.

88
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:59,187
It's not working.

89
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:00,982
Can I see that?

90
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:11,296
You know, it's been 3 months...

91
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,731
since your last case.

92
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,740
Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me--

93
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:24,371
Don't you think it's time
you found another one?

94
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:27,814
I can't but agree.

95
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:31,544
My mind rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems. Give me work.

96
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,348
The sooner, the better.

97
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,254
Paper.

98
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:39,122
Let's see, then. There's a letter here...

99
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:42,594
from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.

100
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:46,292
-Her husband's disappeared.
-He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.

101
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,096
Is it November?

102
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:50,899
Yes, Holmes. All right.

103
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:53,871
Lady Radford reports...

104
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,238
Her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

105
00:09:56,412 --> 00:10:00,712
Insurance swindle. Lord Radford
likes fast women and slow ponies.

106
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:04,580
I see you're the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging.

107
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:05,778
Yes.

108
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:09,550
It was our last case together
and I wanted to see it through to the end.

109
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:17,893
A Mr. Lewis is seeking...

110
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,763
There's only one case
that intrigues me at present:

111
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:25,032
The curious case of Mrs. Hudson,
the absentee landlady.

112
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,232
I've been studying
her comings and goings.

113
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,502
They appear most sinister.

114
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,374
Tea, Mr. Holmes?

115
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,809
Is it poisoned, nanny?

116
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,315
There's enough of that in you already.

117
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:38,009
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place...

118
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,519
as per usual, nanny.

119
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,885
He's killed the dog. Again.

120
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,425
What have you done to Gladstone now?

121
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,689
I was simply testing a new anesthetic.

122
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,526
He doesn't mind.

123
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,800
Holmes, as your doctor...

124
00:10:55,971 --> 00:11:00,169
-He'll be as right as a trivet in no time.
-As your friend...

125
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:04,369
you've been in this room for 2 weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

126
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:08,643
There's nothing of interest for me
out there, on earth, at all.

127
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:12,418
-You're free this evening?
-Absolutely.

128
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,818
-Dinner? The Royale?
-Wonderful. My favorite.

129
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,519
Mary's coming.

130
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,622
-Not available.
-You're meeting her, Holmes.

131
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,662
Have you proposed yet?

132
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,866
-No, I haven't found the right ring.
-Then it's not official.

133
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,164
It's happening, whether you like it or not.

134
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:32,398
8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket.

135
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,202
You wear a jacket.

136
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:50,525
A man? Outside my house?

137
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,033
Straighten your tie.

138
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:10,971
Holmes.

139
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,912
You're early.

140
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,809
Fashionably.

141
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,954
Miss Mary Morstan.

142
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,453
My goodness. What a pleasure.

143
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:25,258
I don't know why it's taken him so long
to introduce us properly.

144
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,826
Pleasure is mine.

145
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:35,067
It really is quite a thrill to meet you,
Mr. Holmes.

146
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:37,205
I've heard so much about you.

147
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,700
I have a pile of detective novels at home.

148
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,070
-Wilkie Collins, Poe.
-It's true.

149
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,735
It can seem a little far-fetched
though sometimes...

150
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:47,638
making grand assumptions
out of tiny details.

151
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:49,613
That's not quite right, is it?

152
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:52,752
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

153
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,622
-Take Watson.
-I intend to.

154
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,221
See his walking stick?
A rare African snakewood...

155
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,868
hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.

156
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:10,469
A few were awarded
to veterans of the Afghan war...

157
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,664
so I can assume
he's a decorated soldier.

158
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:15,867
Strong, brave,
born to be a man of action.

159
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,673
And neat, like all military men.

160
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,816
Now, I check his pockets.

161
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:27,384
A stub from a boxing match.
Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.

162
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,217
I'd keep an eye on that dowry.

163
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,689
-Those days are behind me.
-Right behind you.

164
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,691
He's cost us the rent more than once.

165
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,530
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
you know John very well.

166
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,191
What about a complete stranger?

167
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,128
-What can you tell about me?
-You?

168
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,863
-I don't think--
-I don't know that--

169
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,166
-Not at dinner.
-Some other time.

170
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:47,468
-I insist.
-You insist?

171
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,737
-You remember we discussed this.
-The lady insists.

172
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,609
-You're a governess.
-Well done.

173
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,379
Yes, well done. Shall we...?

174
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,854
-Waiter?
-Your student...

175
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,356
is a boy of 8.

176
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:07,393
-Charlie's 7, actually.
-Charlie?

177
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:10,396
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

178
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,160
Is there ink on my face?

179
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:14,268
There's nothing wrong with your face.

180
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,370
There are 2 drops on your ear, in fact.

181
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:18,699
India blue's nearly impossible
to wash off.

182
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,501
A very impetuous act by the boy.

183
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,803
But you're too experienced
to react rashly...

184
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:25,742
which is why the lady for whom you work
lent you that.

185
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:30,447
Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby.
Hardly the gems of a governess.

186
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,450
The jewels you are not wearing
tell us more.

187
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,923
-Holmes.
-You were engaged.

188
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:41,562
The ring is gone,
but the lighter skin suggests...

189
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,460
that you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly...

190
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,124
until you were informed
of its true, modest worth.

191
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,963
You broke off the engagement...

192
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,936
and returned to England
for better prospects.

193
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:54,735
A doctor, perhaps.

194
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:03,374
Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes,
apart from one.

195
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,323
I didn't leave him.

196
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:10,114
He died.

197
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,627
Well done, old boy.

198
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,267
-Fight. Fight.
-Get him.

199
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,406
Get up and fight.

200
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:41,679
Fight.

201
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,340
-Finish it.
-Come on.

202
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,518
Get up and fight, come on.

203
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,719
Come on.

204
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,328
Get up.

205
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,659
Get up and fight.

206
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,373
That's it, big man, we're done.

207
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,474
You won, congratulations.

208
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:13,542
We ain't done yet.

209
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,617
This mustn't register
on an emotional level.

210
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:24,453
First, distract target.

211
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,389
Then block his blind jab.

212
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,431
Counter with cross to left cheek.

213
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,765
Discombobulate.

214
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,836
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.

215
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:39,132
Employ elbow block, and body shot.

216
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,604
Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.

217
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,240
Now fracture.

218
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,645
Break cracked ribs.

219
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:51,484
Traumatize solar plexus.

220
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,419
Dislocate jaw entirely.

221
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,626
Heel kick to diaphragm.

222
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:05,099
In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured,
3 ribs cracked, 4 broken...

223
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:08,065
diaphragm hemorrhaging,
physical recovery, 6 weeks...

224
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,069
full psychological recovery,
6 months...

225
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,333
capacity to spit at back of head...

226
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:15,203
neutralized.

227
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,232
Where did that come from?

228
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,574
What the hell's going on here, Charlie?

229
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,273
Lord Blackwood's put him
under some kind of spell, sir.

230
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:32,181
It's like he's burning from the inside out.

231
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:37,586
You lot, shut up!

232
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,551
Charlie. Charlie!

233
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:41,859
Take this man to the infirmary, now.

234
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:56,771
What's this all about, then, Blackwood?

235
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,074
There's someone I want to see.

236
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:25,765
-Watson?
-Right.

237
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,636
Let's go.

238
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,211
What started merely as an experiment...

239
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:33,314
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

240
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:36,415
Now, if I play a chromatic scale...

241
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,883
there's no measurable response.

242
00:20:39,054 --> 00:20:41,784
You do know what you're drinking
is meant for eye surgery?

243
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:43,322
But, now...

244
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,789
and this is remarkable...

245
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,589
if I change to atonal clusters...

246
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:54,101
voilà, they fly in counterclockwise,
synchronized concentric circles...

247
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:55,861
as though a regimented flock.

248
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,664
Watson, this is exceptional.

249
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,606
I, using musical theory,
have created order out of chaos.

250
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:05,408
How did you lure them in?

251
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:07,280
Excellent question.

252
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:10,350
Individually. I've been at it for 6 hours.

253
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,145
-And what happens if I do this?
-What?

254
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,823
-Right.
-Clean yourself up.

255
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,461
You are Blackwood's last request.

256
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,933
Look at those towering structures.

257
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,407
It's the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge ever attempted.

258
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,481
Most innovative.

259
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:45,844
What an industrious empire.

260
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:50,514
I have your winnings from last night.

261
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,760
You weren't there,
so I made your customary bet.

262
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,626
Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook,
locked safely away in my drawer.

263
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:05,467
Did you know the opera house
is featuring Don Giovanni?

264
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,202
I could procure a couple of tickets if you
had any cultural inclinations this evening.

265
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:15,712
You have the grand gift of silence,
Watson.

266
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:18,512
It makes you quite invaluable
as a companion.

267
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,288
I knew she'd been engaged.

268
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,550
She had told me.

269
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,421
So that's no to the opera, then?

270
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:36,194
-That was my waistcoat.
-We agreed it's too small for you.

271
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:37,861
-I'd like it back.
-We agreed.

272
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,529
I want it back.

273
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,465
This way, Mr. Holmes.

274
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:19,577
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.

275
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:23,217
Which I'm certain will disperse
once his feet have stopped twitching.

276
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,875
Care to come along?

277
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:28,352
No, old cock.
I've no business with him whilst he's alive.

278
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:30,821
Suit yourself, mother hen.

279
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:45,902
It seems you have lots of rooms to let.

280
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:49,874
We had to move the prisoners, sir.
Otherwise we were gonna have a riot.

281
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:53,310
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.

282
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,073
As though...

283
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,584
he can get inside their heads.

284
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,591
I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

285
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:07,489
Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir.

286
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:12,163
If any man have an ear, let him hear.

287
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,235
I stood upon the sand of the sea
and saw a beast rise up...

288
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,132
having 7 heads and 10 horns.

289
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:19,603
Upon his heads were
the name of blasphemy.

290
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:22,038
They worshiped the dragon,
which gave power.

291
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,770
They worshiped, saying,
"Who is like unto the beast?"

292
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:26,811
The beast which I saw
was like a leopard.

293
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,644
His feet were of a bear,
his mouth was of a lion...

294
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:33,447
and the dragon gave him his power
and his seat and great authority.

295
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:35,920
I love what you've done with the place.

296
00:24:37,592 --> 00:24:39,890
So glad you could accept my invitation.

297
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:43,089
I just have a small point of concern.

298
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:46,662
-How can I help?
-I'd followed the murders with interest.

299
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:49,666
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

300
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:53,797
I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

301
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,407
-You're too kind.
-However, by comparison...

302
00:24:56,578 --> 00:25:00,412
your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

303
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,119
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

304
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,450
Either that or...

305
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,993
shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

306
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:17,598
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

307
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,759
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

308
00:25:21,936 --> 00:25:25,463
-I'm merely the channel.
-My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

309
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,404
You see,
5 lives might have been spared.

310
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:31,568
Those lives were a necessity.

311
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,908
Sacrifice.

312
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,385
5 meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

313
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:40,987
I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

314
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:42,885
After you're hanged, of course.

315
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,895
I'd wager there's some deformity
that'd be scientifically significant.

316
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:51,692
Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

317
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,929
Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

318
00:25:56,104 --> 00:26:00,973
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

319
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,804
You and I are bound together
on a journey...

320
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:06,538
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

321
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:11,178
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

322
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:13,418
That worries me.

323
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:16,917
Steel your mind, Holmes.

324
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,583
I need you.

325
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,194
You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

326
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:22,920
-And I will rise again.
-Bon voyage.

327
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:24,759
Pay attention.

328
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:28,266
3 more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

329
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:31,496
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

330
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,200
or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

331
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:38,607
it'll be the last sane thought
in your head.

332
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:47,711
What did he want?

333
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:49,447
Not sure.

334
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:52,593
But I don't think you're needed, Father.
Not for this one.

335
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,329
Lord Henry Blackwood...

336
00:26:56,498 --> 00:27:00,935
you are sentenced to death
for the practice of black magic...

337
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,429
the unholy murder of
5 innocent young women...

338
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:07,006
and the attempted murder of a 6th.

339
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:09,676
Do you have any final words?

340
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,304
Death...

341
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,508
is only the beginning.

342
00:27:26,694 --> 00:27:28,787
forever and ever. Amen.

343
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:53,417
That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

344
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:17,768
London's so bleak this time of year.

345
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,582
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

346
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:24,240
I much prefer to travel in the winter.

347
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,886
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

348
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:32,925
I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

349
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:35,119
and your favorite...

350
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,662
olives from the Cyclades.

351
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:40,062
Thought we might have a little tea party.

352
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:43,693
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

353
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:45,931
A file with my name on it.

354
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,140
"Theft of Velázquez portrait
from king of Spain."

355
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:54,137
"Missing naval documents lead
to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

356
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:59,314
"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

357
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:04,884
Hapsburg prince
to Romanov princess."

358
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:08,985
I was simply studying your methods...

359
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:11,097
should the authorities
ask me to hunt you down.

360
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:15,162
But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

361
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,099
But your signature was clear.

362
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,731
Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

363
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,102
Or just another souvenir?

364
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:26,839
Let's not dwell on the past.

365
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,044
Shall we?

366
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,312
By the looks of things,
you're between jobs.

367
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:37,754
And you between husbands.
How much did you get for the ring?

368
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:41,821
He was boring and jealous,
and he snored.

369
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,629
I'm Irene Adler again.

370
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,465
Thank you.

371
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,049
I need your help.

372
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,980
I need you to find someone.

373
00:30:08,456 --> 00:30:10,014
Why are you always so suspicious?

374
00:30:10,191 --> 00:30:12,716
Shall I answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

375
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,853
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

376
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:22,827
I think you'll find all the information
you need inside.

377
00:30:24,138 --> 00:30:25,833
Who are you working for?

378
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,205
So I'll have to find out the hard way?

379
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,743
Keep your money.
I didn't say I'll take the case.

380
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,405
Well, consider it a wager that you will.

381
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:38,514
Do you remember The Grand?

382
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:40,916
They gave me our old room.

383
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:55,666
Hold the door.

384
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,702
Thanks, doctor.

385
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:21,761
Ma'am.

386
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:28,664
-He'll do it.
-Well done, Miss Adler.

387
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,561
That's precisely why I hired you.

388
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,334
I wager he'll have our man
within the next 24 hours.

389
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,068
He'd better.

390
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:39,475
Reordan is the key
to what Blackwood was doing.

391
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:42,311
He's essential to my plan.

392
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,610
Get off out of it.

393
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:47,414
What you doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

394
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:49,579
-You scalp diver.
-Get off out of it.

395
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:53,287
A little rifle range
would go a long way, sir...

396
00:31:53,461 --> 00:31:56,862
rubbing the calluses
off these German bands.

397
00:31:57,598 --> 00:31:58,929
God save the queen.

398
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,398
God save the queen, sir.

399
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:02,900
Get off out of it.

400
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,372
Look at you.

401
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:11,570
Why is the only woman
you've cared about a criminal?

402
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:12,770
Are you a masochist?

403
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:15,040
-Allow me to explain.
-Allow me.

404
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:18,982
She's the only adversary
who ever outsmarted you. Twice.

405
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:20,814
Made a proper idiot out of you.

406
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:23,616
-Right, you've had your fun.
-What's she after, anyway?

407
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,259
-It's time to press on.
-What could she possibly need?

408
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:27,826
It doesn't matter.

409
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:31,123
An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.

410
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,132
She could sit on your back
and paddle you up the Thames.

411
00:32:34,302 --> 00:32:36,395
That's of no consequence to you, is it?

412
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,505
We've done our last case together.

413
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:40,265
I've already read it.

414
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:43,133
Missing person:

415
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:46,303
Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10,
red hair, no front teeth.

416
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:47,505
Case solved.

417
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:50,981
You're obviously not her type.
She likes ginger dwarves.

418
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,779
-Midget.
-So you agree?

419
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:54,216
No, I don't agree.

420
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,948
It's more than technicality, you see.

421
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,185
You're misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

422
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:03,888
-I've said too much. I've upset you.
-No, I am simply stating that one has--

423
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,555
What were you doing?

424
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:08,327
-Will you allow me to explain?
-I wish you would.

425
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,425
-Holmes. What are you doing?
-Nothing.

426
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:37,223
-Are you wearing a false--?
-False nose? No.

427
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:39,830
-Tell me that that wasn't...
-That wasn't.

428
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:43,837
Holmes. Where are you going?

429
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,242
Watson.

430
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:52,676
Watson.

431
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,535
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal because you're so pretty.

432
00:34:17,303 --> 00:34:19,571
My lucky day.

433
00:34:20,341 --> 00:34:22,639
Hello, gorgeous.
You got something for me?

434
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,075
Don't move.

435
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:33,111
Now, what have we got here?

436
00:34:34,488 --> 00:34:35,614
It's--

437
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,687
Thank you.

438
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,757
That's the Irene I know.

439
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:52,499
Good boy.

440
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,318
This man intrigues me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

441
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,852
-Which is no mean feat.
-She's intimidated.

442
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:42,182
She's scared of him.

443
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:43,516
Yet she works for him.

444
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:47,090
-Right.
-It's nothing to do with me...

445
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:49,991
but I advise you leave the case alone.

446
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:51,722
Well, I may not have a choice.

447
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,993
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

448
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,061
-Get that out of my face.
-It's not. It's in my hand.

449
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,537
Get what's in your hand out of my face.

450
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,005
-Mr. Holmes?
-Clarkie.

451
00:36:02,877 --> 00:36:05,311
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

452
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:08,141
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

453
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:10,375
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

454
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:12,075
No, "you" means you.

455
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,653
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He...

456
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:16,153
Well...

457
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,616
it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

458
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:30,360
-Most engaging.
-Very clever.

459
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:32,438
I pronounced the man dead myself.

460
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,842
What are the facts?

461
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,275
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

462
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,144
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

463
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:46,881
-I have an appointment with Mary.
-It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

464
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:48,612
Don't try that.

465
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,020
-The newspapers got wind of it?
-That's what we're trying to avoid.

466
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:53,785
Certainly.

467
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:55,392
What's the major concern?

468
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:58,031
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

469
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,066
-Indeed.
-You're not taking this seriously, are you?

470
00:37:01,235 --> 00:37:02,725
Yes, as you should.

471
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,764
It's a matter of professional integrity.

472
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:10,900
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

473
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,258
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

474
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,864
-Sir?
-The rugby match.

475
00:37:32,466 --> 00:37:36,129
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

476
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:40,330
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

477
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,301
You took your time, Holmes.

478
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:48,676
"And on the 3rd day"...

479
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,445
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

480
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:55,714
and they're smashed open
from the inside.

481
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,484
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

482
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:02,026
-We are in the process of bringing it up.
-I see.

483
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:07,263
Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

484
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,599
Anyhow, where's our witness?

485
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:13,069
He's over there.

486
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,401
And apparently, he is cata--

487
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:16,600
Cat--

488
00:38:16,777 --> 00:38:18,267
Catatonic, sir.

489
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,341
-He's not feeling very well.
-Yes.

490
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:27,386
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering
milkmaids, you're on double-time.

491
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,047
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up now.

492
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,625
Good day, sir.

493
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:36,223
Hello.

494
00:38:37,431 --> 00:38:38,955
It's all right.

495
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,828
I'm a doctor.

496
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:53,479
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

497
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:58,308
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

498
00:38:58,652 --> 00:38:59,949
Well?

499
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,248
-Well?
-You pronounced him dead.

500
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,915
He had no pulse.

501
00:39:10,764 --> 00:39:12,254
Ready.

502
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,590
Down.

503
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,104
Good Lord.

504
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,240
That's not Blackwood.

505
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:36,286
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

506
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:42,294
Time of death?

507
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,831
Diptera is...

508
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:49,498
approximately...

509
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:53,229
2/3 of an inch
which would put the time of death...

510
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:55,466
at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

511
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,940
May I borrow your pen?

512
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,041
-Adler's dwarf.
-Midget.

513
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:16,261
I know what I saw.

514
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:19,463
It was Blackwood.

515
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:23,099
As clear as I see you.

516
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:27,567
And when the dead walk...

517
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,342
the living will fill these coffins.

518
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:35,175
Well...

519
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,950
Right. Put the lid
on and clean this lot up.

520
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:44,181
You really believe he was resurrected?

521
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,349
The question is not if, but how.

522
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,518
-The game's afoot.
-Follow your spirit--

523
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,391
And upon this charge, cry:

524
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:53,931
"God for Harry, England and St. George."

525
00:40:56,503 --> 00:40:57,731
There you are.

526
00:40:58,005 --> 00:41:00,473
Why that certain chips stall,
I don't understand.

527
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:04,839
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.

528
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:08,808
You know, Holmes, I've seen
things in war I don't understand.

529
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,281
I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

530
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:13,784
right down to the number
and the placement...

531
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:16,184
of the bullets that killed him.

532
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:17,949
You have to admit, Holmes...

533
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,753
that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

534
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:23,055
is theoretically possible.

535
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:28,190
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

536
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,133
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

537
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:33,500
instead of theories to suit facts.

538
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:37,576
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

539
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:42,410
Right. Scratches around the keyhole
where the watch was wound.

540
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,177
-What does that tell you?
-The man was likely a drunk.

541
00:41:45,352 --> 00:41:48,753
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

542
00:41:48,922 --> 00:41:49,946
Very good, Watson.

543
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:53,421
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

544
00:41:53,994 --> 00:41:56,758
Let's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored--

545
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,454
-Pawnbrokers' marks.
-Excellent.

546
00:41:58,632 --> 00:42:02,932
Most recent of which are "M. H. "
M. H. M. H. is for?

547
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,628
-Maddison and Haig.
-Maddison and Haig.

548
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,741
They should be able to
give us an address.

549
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,478
What a coincidence.

550
00:42:18,419 --> 00:42:21,115
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

551
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,687
Really? I think not.

552
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:26,053
The time.
I have to get back, Holmes.

553
00:42:26,226 --> 00:42:28,126
Taking tea with the in-laws.

554
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,559
-Reckon your future, sir?
-Absolutely not.

555
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,256
-No, thank you.
-You need to hear what I have to tell.

556
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:35,800
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

557
00:42:35,969 --> 00:42:38,199
Even if it's to do with Mary?

558
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:47,804
I see 2 men. Brothers.

559
00:42:47,981 --> 00:42:49,778
Not in blood, but in bond.

560
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:55,182
What of Mary?

561
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:59,155
M for Mary, for marriage.
You will be married.

562
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:01,321
Go on.

563
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:04,688
I see patterned tablecloths...

564
00:43:04,865 --> 00:43:07,299
and China figurines...

565
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:09,436
and lace doilies.

566
00:43:10,137 --> 00:43:11,161
Doilies.

567
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,830
Lace doilies? Holmes.

568
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:18,267
Does your depravity know no bounds?

569
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:20,276
-No.
-She turns to fat...

570
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,278
and she has a beard and...

571
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:24,610
-What of the warts?
-She's covered in warts.

572
00:43:24,785 --> 00:43:26,412
-Enough.
-Are they extensive?

573
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,521
Please, enough.

574
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:32,859
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.

575
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:36,387
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

576
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:37,621
Do you have my money?

577
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:40,323
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

578
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:42,594
-Do you have my cut from the fight?
-Admit it.

579
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,863
-Give me my money! Holmes.
-Admit it!

580
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,572
I see.

581
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:56,079
Thank you.

582
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:01,847
Well, you've got your ring and I've got
my address for the ginger midget.

583
00:44:02,022 --> 00:44:05,514
-Should be just there.
-I think she'll really like this.

584
00:44:05,692 --> 00:44:09,458
And I have some change in my pocket.

585
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:16,393
-Shall I look after it for you?
-No, no.

586
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:19,138
-Don't give it away here.
-No.

587
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:21,297
I have to go see Mary.

588
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,372
Give her my best.

589
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:26,303
And her family, as well.

590
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:08,414
It does make a considerable
difference to me...

591
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:11,183
having someone with me
on whom I can thoroughly rely.

592
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,850
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

593
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,455
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

594
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,498
Something did.

595
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,232
Irene Adler was here.

596
00:45:24,438 --> 00:45:28,499
Either that or the ginger midget
wore the same Parisian perfume.

597
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:33,779
Putrefaction.

598
00:45:38,418 --> 00:45:42,149
Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas.

599
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:47,955
Phosphorous.

600
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:50,623
Formaldehyde.

601
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,503
It looks like...

602
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:07,576
he was attempting to combine...

603
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:11,115
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

604
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:20,992
More importantly...

605
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:24,120
let's see what he was
trying to dispose of.

606
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,925
-Potassium, magnesium.
-Sultaphytic acid.

607
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:32,060
It'll suck the iron right out of the ink
as long as it's not too burnt.

608
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:48,377
Peculiar.

609
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:53,123
Hydrated rhododendron.

610
00:47:18,185 --> 00:47:19,715
Holmes.

611
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,054
Look at the crest.

612
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:24,986
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

613
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:26,887
Of course he was.

614
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,358
The question is, to what end.

615
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:36,599
Whatever he was working on,
he clearly succeeded.

616
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,067
How so?

617
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:40,468
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

618
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,234
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

619
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,937
Yes.

620
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,103
There is one odor
I can't quite put my finger on.

621
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,613
Is it candy floss? Molasses?

622
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,149
Maple syrup?

623
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,411
Barley sugar.

624
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:55,350
Toffee apple.

625
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,455
Let me guess.

626
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,722
Judging by your arsonist tool kit...

627
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:08,857
you're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

628
00:48:09,036 --> 00:48:11,266
Just one minute, boys.

629
00:48:11,938 --> 00:48:13,235
Dredger.

630
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:34,257
Meat...

631
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:35,788
or potatoes?

632
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:38,191
My 10 minutes are up.

633
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,041
You all right?

634
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:50,453
Holmes...

635
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:52,395
what is that?

636
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:21,738
Holmes!

637
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,862
Watson...

638
00:55:17,363 --> 00:55:19,490
what have you done?

639
00:55:30,677 --> 00:55:32,474
I haven't slept all night.

640
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:34,645
Not a wink.

641
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:38,483
Why I ever believed...

642
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,380
that I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents is beyond me...

643
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:46,787
-having been talked into going with you.
-We were set upon. It was self-defense.

644
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,192
I've been reviewing my notes
on our exploits over the last 7 months.

645
00:55:51,364 --> 00:55:53,161
Would you like to know my conclusion?

646
00:55:53,766 --> 00:55:56,667
-I am psychologically disturbed.
-How so?

647
00:55:56,836 --> 00:56:01,000
Why else would I continually be
led into situations...

648
00:56:01,174 --> 00:56:05,770
where you deliberately withhold
your plans from me? Why else?

649
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:09,946
You've never complained
about my methods before.

650
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,380
-I'm not complaining.
-What do you call this?

651
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:14,417
How am I complaining? I never complain.

652
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:17,522
Do I complain about you practicing
the violin in the morning...

653
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:21,888
or your mess, your lack of hygiene,
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

654
00:56:22,061 --> 00:56:23,255
We have a barter system.

655
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:25,795
Do I complain
about you setting fire to my rooms?

656
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:26,989
-Our rooms.
-The rooms.

657
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,760
When do I complain
that you experiment on my dog?

658
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:31,096
-Our dog.
-On the dog.

659
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:32,738
Gladstone is our dog.

660
00:56:32,906 --> 00:56:37,934
Where I do take issue is your campaign
to sabotage my relationship with Mary.

661
00:56:45,618 --> 00:56:47,017
I understand.

662
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:48,881
-Do you?
-I do.

663
00:56:50,089 --> 00:56:52,523
-I don't think you do.
-You're overtired.

664
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:54,650
-Yes.
-You're feeling sensitive.

665
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:55,953
I'm not sensitive.

666
00:56:56,129 --> 00:56:58,359
What you need is a rest.

667
00:56:58,531 --> 00:57:01,193
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

668
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:05,770
Beautiful grounds. There's a folly.
We can throw a lamb on the spit.

669
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:09,739
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country,
it would be with my future wife.

670
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:13,003
-Well, certainly, if we must--
-No, not you. Mary and I.

671
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,942
-You are not--
-What, invited?

672
00:57:15,114 --> 00:57:17,742
Why would I not be invited
to my brother's country home?

673
00:57:17,917 --> 00:57:19,441
Now you're not making any sense.

674
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:20,677
You're not human.

675
00:57:20,853 --> 00:57:22,150
John Watson?

676
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,716
Yes.

677
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:26,688
Your bail's been posted.

678
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:34,089
Mary.

679
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,431
Just Watson.

680
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,677
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because the boys are getting hungry.

681
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,216
Step lively.

682
00:58:00,994 --> 00:58:03,087
Back off. Back off.

683
00:58:03,262 --> 00:58:05,730
To which the barman says,
"May I push in your stool?"

684
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,831
Right, you, you're out.

685
00:58:12,005 --> 00:58:13,563
Until next time, Big Joe.

686
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,106
Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

687
00:58:17,176 --> 00:58:19,804
Thank heaven you're here.
I'd almost run out of jokes.

688
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:22,106
In another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

689
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:25,648
And you, sir, an excellent policeman.
Tomski, thank you.

690
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:28,617
Now, please tell me you have answers.

691
00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:31,086
All in good time, Lestrade.

692
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,715
"All in good time"? Is this some parlor game
where we guess what you're thinking?

693
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:38,125
I've got a public in frenzy out there.
If you don't fill me in...

694
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:42,131
I'll have you in there playing Victoria
and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.

695
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:45,403
Now, clean up
and make yourself presentable.

696
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:46,933
For whom?

697
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,803
Friends in high places.
They're the ones who bailed you out.

698
00:59:01,554 --> 00:59:04,853
I'm terribly sorry
to inconvenience you, sir...

699
00:59:05,024 --> 00:59:07,424
but I'm gonna have to put this on you.

700
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:15,624
Mr. Holmes,
apologies for summoning you like this.

701
00:59:15,968 --> 00:59:19,563
I'm sure it's quite a mystery
as to where you are and who I am.

702
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,101
As to where I am...

703
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:25,477
I was, admittedly, lost for a moment
between Charing Cross and Holborn.

704
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,739
But I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill...

705
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:32,442
the only baker to use a certain
French glaze on their loaves...

706
00:59:32,618 --> 00:59:33,880
a Brittany sage.

707
00:59:34,053 --> 00:59:38,786
The carriage forked left, then right,
a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit.

708
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:42,951
And as to who you are, that took every
ounce of my not inconsiderable experience.

709
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:46,496
The letters on your desk are addressed
to Sir Thomas Rotheram.

710
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,066
Lord Chief Justice,
that'd be your official title.

711
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:52,830
Who you really are is, of course,
another matter entirely.

712
00:59:53,439 --> 00:59:55,339
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...

713
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,033
you're the head of
the Temple of the Four Orders...

714
00:59:58,211 --> 01:00:00,008
in whose headquarters we now sit...

715
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:03,342
on the northwest corner
of St. James's Square, I think.

716
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:07,919
As to the mystery, the only mystery is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

717
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:14,319
Yes, well, standard procedure,
I suppose.

718
01:00:16,162 --> 01:00:18,494
I daresay we have the right man,
gentlemen.

719
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:21,428
Sherlock Holmes,
Ambassador Standish from America...

720
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:23,535
and Lord Coward, the home secretary.

721
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:28,037
I suppose you already have some notion
as to the practices of our order.

722
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,999
Yes.

723
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,539
They're practically interesting.

724
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,112
Be as skeptical as you like.

725
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:38,739
But our secret systems have steered
the world towards good for centuries.

726
01:00:38,918 --> 01:00:42,319
The danger is they can also be used
for more nefarious purposes.

727
01:00:42,488 --> 01:00:45,286
What some call the dark arts,
or practical magic.

728
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:49,019
We know you don't believe
in magic, Mr. Holmes.

729
01:00:49,195 --> 01:00:51,789
We don't expect you to share our faith...

730
01:00:51,964 --> 01:00:53,363
merely our fears.

731
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:56,127
Fear is the more infectious condition.

732
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:58,293
In this instance...

733
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:02,402
fear of your own child.

734
01:01:05,678 --> 01:01:07,339
Blackwood is your son.

735
01:01:07,513 --> 01:01:10,971
You have the same irises,
a rare dark green...

736
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,050
with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...

737
01:01:13,219 --> 01:01:17,246
together with identical outer ears, which
are only passed down through bloodline...

738
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,448
which makes you either brothers...

739
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:22,355
or, in this case, more likely,
father and son.

740
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:30,830
Very few people
are privy to that information...

741
01:01:31,003 --> 01:01:32,834
and we want to keep it that way.

742
01:01:37,643 --> 01:01:39,770
He was conceived
during one of our rituals.

743
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,345
His mother wasn't my wife...

744
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,745
but she shared our beliefs.

745
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,077
She was a powerful practitioner...

746
01:01:46,252 --> 01:01:48,914
though not enough
to survive giving birth to him.

747
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,925
Death followed him wherever he went.

748
01:01:53,092 --> 01:01:55,526
Those 5 girls were not the first
to be butchered.

749
01:01:55,695 --> 01:01:58,858
He killed many more,
using them to enhance his powers.

750
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:02,628
No one could prove anything,
of course, but we all knew.

751
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,327
The boy was a curse.

752
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:08,473
We've done our best to stop him,
but it's not enough.

753
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,040
His power grows daily.

754
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:12,268
His resurrection is evidence of that.

755
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,973
But what he does next
will be more dangerous.

756
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:19,607
His secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.

757
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:23,086
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the course of world.

758
01:02:23,256 --> 01:02:26,054
We want you to find him
and stop him before he does.

759
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:29,861
We'll give you any assistance
that we can.

760
01:02:30,963 --> 01:02:34,455
As home secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

761
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:36,192
Yes.

762
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:39,268
So...

763
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:42,540
name your price.

764
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,903
The benefit of being
a consulting detective...

765
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:47,136
is that I can pick and choose
my clients.

766
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,845
So consider it done, I'll stop him.

767
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,281
But not for you.

768
01:02:53,452 --> 01:02:55,420
And certainly not for a price.

769
01:02:58,758 --> 01:03:02,250
-I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas.
-What is that?

770
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:06,262
If the rest of his family's dead,
how long do you expect to survive?

771
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:08,758
Food for thought.

772
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:37,184
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
opening that.

773
01:03:37,763 --> 01:03:41,028
Margaux '58. A comet vintage.

774
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:45,536
How fascinating that an astronomical event
can affect the quality--

775
01:03:45,705 --> 01:03:48,196
How is it going with our case
you refuse to take?

776
01:03:48,374 --> 01:03:49,705
of the wine.

777
01:03:51,343 --> 01:03:53,812
I've hit a dead end, literally.

778
01:03:55,348 --> 01:03:56,872
I found your man.

779
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:59,381
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

780
01:04:00,286 --> 01:04:01,651
If you still need him.

781
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:05,420
Dear.

782
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,557
Hope my client
doesn't come looking for a refund.

783
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,095
He's a professor, isn't he?

784
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:15,165
Couldn't see his face,
but I spotted chalk on his lapel.

785
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:19,600
I've never known a professor to carry a gun,
and on such a clever contraption.

786
01:04:23,642 --> 01:04:26,110
Eye patch, nice touch.

787
01:04:27,013 --> 01:04:29,072
So case closed...

788
01:04:29,248 --> 01:04:32,274
which makes this a social visit.

789
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,352
No, it's a "you're in over your head,
Irene" visit.

790
01:04:36,055 --> 01:04:38,546
Whoever killed Reordan
was covering their tracks...

791
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:40,919
which makes you the next loose end
to be snipped.

792
01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:44,656
Let it breathe.

793
01:04:45,598 --> 01:04:47,725
I've never been in over my head.

794
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,427
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

795
01:04:51,604 --> 01:04:55,700
Or stay and volunteer
for protective custody.

796
01:04:58,778 --> 01:05:02,305
If I'm in danger, so are you.

797
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,646
Come with me.

798
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:11,951
What if we trusted each other?

799
01:05:13,883 --> 01:05:14,941
You're not listening.

800
01:05:15,118 --> 01:05:19,714
I'm taking you to either the railway station
or the police station.

801
01:05:31,568 --> 01:05:33,001
So...

802
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:38,170
-Which is it to be?
-Careful.

803
01:05:40,076 --> 01:05:41,668
You decide.

804
01:05:41,845 --> 01:05:44,279
-Which will it be?
-What--?

805
01:05:44,881 --> 01:05:46,746
I told you to let it breathe.

806
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,677
Can you taste the comet?

807
01:05:55,758 --> 01:05:59,125
Why couldn't you just
come away with me?

808
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:02,226
Never.

809
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:53,134
Madam, I need you to remain calm
and trust me, I'm a professional.

810
01:07:53,306 --> 01:07:55,797
But beneath this pillow
lies the key to my release.

811
01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:00,307
-She misinterpreted my intention entirely.
-Naturally, sir.

812
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,244
That's why I find this modern
religious fervor so troubling.

813
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:06,681
-No latitude for misunderstanding.
-Faith runs right over reason, sir.

814
01:08:06,853 --> 01:08:09,845
Indeed. And chambermaids
were once such a liberal breed.

815
01:08:10,023 --> 01:08:12,321
My wife's a chambermaid, sir.

816
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:18,363
Anyhow, a good thing she was offended,
or we may never have found you.

817
01:08:18,531 --> 01:08:22,262
The inspector's been over to Baker Street
himself this morning, sir.

818
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:27,931
Just joking about the wife, sir.

819
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:34,202
We've checked everything, sir.

820
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,213
No sign of a break-in
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

821
01:08:37,383 --> 01:08:39,544
So body in the bathtub...

822
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:43,951
his eyes were wide open,
and the only thing missing was...

823
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:47,017
his ring, sir.

824
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,804
Why did you drain the water?

825
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:08,641
-Out of common decency.
-Crime is common, logic is rare.

826
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:12,842
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer,
not provide comfort for the corpse.

827
01:09:27,534 --> 01:09:29,001
What is that?

828
01:09:32,605 --> 01:09:34,539
-Jasmine bath salts, sir.
-Superb.

829
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:38,302
Probably comes from a larger container.
It'll either be in the pantry...

830
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:42,175
high up where it's warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

831
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:44,673
Constable, you could do worse...

832
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:48,150
than to check the ground under
the rear windows for any footprints.

833
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:51,051
Data, data, data.
I cannot make bricks without clay.

834
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,011
Mr. Holmes?

835
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,824
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

836
01:11:02,996 --> 01:11:04,793
It was in the pantry, sir.

837
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:07,028
I don't know what to make of this.

838
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,963
Excellent work.

839
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:10,864
Adieu.

840
01:11:48,808 --> 01:11:52,300
What's the meaning of this, Coward?
Why have you called this meeting?

841
01:11:53,546 --> 01:11:54,774
Sir Thomas is dead.

842
01:11:56,983 --> 01:12:00,009
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the order.

843
01:12:03,056 --> 01:12:05,047
Have you lost your mind?

844
01:12:05,224 --> 01:12:07,158
You know damn well
what he's capable of.

845
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:09,227
Of course he does.

846
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:12,961
That's why we're here.

847
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,161
That's why we're all here.

848
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:25,871
My powers and my assets
were given to me for one purpose.

849
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:30,409
A magnificent but simple purpose.

850
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:33,610
To create a new future.

851
01:12:34,253 --> 01:12:37,689
A future ruled...

852
01:12:37,857 --> 01:12:39,620
by us.

853
01:12:41,594 --> 01:12:46,725
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

854
01:12:48,201 --> 01:12:49,600
Magic will lead the way.

855
01:12:49,769 --> 01:12:52,203
Once the people of England
see our newfound power...

856
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:54,306
they'll bow down in fear.

857
01:12:59,278 --> 01:13:03,078
Across the Atlantic
lies a colony that was once ours.

858
01:13:03,249 --> 01:13:04,580
It will be again.

859
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:07,749
The Civil War has made them weak.

860
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,721
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours...

861
01:13:12,892 --> 01:13:15,122
so we'll take it back.

862
01:13:16,763 --> 01:13:19,129
We will remake the world...

863
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:22,528
create the future.

864
01:13:23,836 --> 01:13:27,567
These men are with me, Standish...

865
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,298
but...

866
01:13:29,575 --> 01:13:30,974
are you?

867
01:13:31,644 --> 01:13:34,340
No, sir. I am not.

868
01:13:35,348 --> 01:13:38,215
These powers that you're playing with...

869
01:13:38,384 --> 01:13:40,443
no man can control.

870
01:13:42,555 --> 01:13:44,352
Well, gentlemen...

871
01:13:45,858 --> 01:13:49,259
someone has to stop him,
even if you won't.

872
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:53,590
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

873
01:13:58,838 --> 01:14:00,829
Save me!

874
01:14:16,923 --> 01:14:18,584
Gentlemen...

875
01:14:18,758 --> 01:14:20,623
don't be afraid.

876
01:14:21,594 --> 01:14:23,425
As you can see...

877
01:14:24,697 --> 01:14:26,722
we are protected.

878
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,491
Come, drink your allegiance here.

879
01:14:36,742 --> 01:14:40,508
You control the police, now use them.

880
01:14:52,258 --> 01:14:53,486
Didn't know you were here.

881
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:56,924
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I utilize it?

882
01:14:58,297 --> 01:14:59,787
Be my guest.

883
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,165
-In here, chaps.
-Where would you like me...

884
01:15:03,336 --> 01:15:05,770
-to put him, sir?
-Anywhere is fine.

885
01:15:16,349 --> 01:15:19,477
-Who is he?
-The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.

886
01:15:19,652 --> 01:15:22,519
His neck didn't survive the impact
of Dredger landing on him.

887
01:15:23,222 --> 01:15:24,689
Yes.

888
01:15:25,358 --> 01:15:27,258
Thanks for that, by the way.

889
01:15:29,228 --> 01:15:33,756
There is consolation in the knowledge that
he could be of service to his fellow man.

890
01:15:37,737 --> 01:15:42,401
Elbows and arms stained with blood,
but it's older than his own injuries.

891
01:15:48,347 --> 01:15:50,372
None of it human.

892
01:15:51,284 --> 01:15:52,808
He's not a butcher, let me see.

893
01:16:02,962 --> 01:16:05,192
Yellow flame, green bursts.

894
01:16:05,798 --> 01:16:07,095
An industrial worker.

895
01:16:11,437 --> 01:16:12,734
Coal.

896
01:16:12,905 --> 01:16:14,532
River silt.

897
01:16:14,707 --> 01:16:17,107
The slag on his trousers
should put him squarely in...

898
01:16:17,276 --> 01:16:19,403
-Nine Elms.
-Sorry, what?

899
01:16:20,012 --> 01:16:22,242
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

900
01:16:22,415 --> 01:16:24,280
I wondered.

901
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:27,783
Do you remember where I put
the Lords Register of members' interests?

902
01:16:27,954 --> 01:16:29,319
It's on the stepladder.

903
01:16:39,799 --> 01:16:44,293
Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about
everything that's corrosive to the spirit.

904
01:16:44,904 --> 01:16:47,873
Woolwich Arsenal.
Limehouse Chemical Works.

905
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,031
It'll probably be a factory by the river.

906
01:16:50,476 --> 01:16:51,966
What's that?

907
01:16:52,378 --> 01:16:53,868
Never mind.

908
01:16:55,715 --> 01:16:57,979
You don't know where
my rugby ball went, do you?

909
01:16:58,150 --> 01:16:59,481
No, not a clue.

910
01:16:59,652 --> 01:17:02,587
Queenshithe Slaughterhouse.

911
01:17:02,755 --> 01:17:04,154
Nine Elms.

912
01:17:04,323 --> 01:17:06,314
A factory by the river.

913
01:17:06,692 --> 01:17:09,627
Well done. That should lead us
to Blackwood, dead or alive.

914
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:11,890
Not us.

915
01:17:13,733 --> 01:17:15,064
You.

916
01:17:15,534 --> 01:17:16,967
Yes.

917
01:17:18,371 --> 01:17:20,601
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

918
01:17:29,715 --> 01:17:31,012
He's left it there on purpose.

919
01:17:51,537 --> 01:17:53,971
More coal, doctor.

920
01:17:58,444 --> 01:18:01,140
That's a good one. He's such a tit.

921
01:18:01,314 --> 01:18:02,838
God. Yeah.

922
01:18:03,015 --> 01:18:04,880
Glad to see you two
are working hard.

923
01:18:05,051 --> 01:18:07,679
And I thought we were
trying to be discreet.

924
01:18:07,853 --> 01:18:11,687
You would not last one day in the navy.

925
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:17,962
Are you sure there isn't an alternative
means of water transportation than that?

926
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:21,725
I guarantee you nobody knows
London's waterways better.

927
01:18:21,967 --> 01:18:25,403
-Tanner's practically a fish himself.
-He certainly drinks like one.

928
01:18:25,571 --> 01:18:27,698
You found a sense of humor, doctor.

929
01:18:27,873 --> 01:18:30,137
If only just a sense.

930
01:18:30,576 --> 01:18:34,478
I better take over, there.
Bit tricky down here.

931
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:57,534
Come on, come on.

932
01:19:12,852 --> 01:19:14,376
-Look familiar?
-Yep.

933
01:19:14,553 --> 01:19:17,215
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

934
01:19:29,668 --> 01:19:32,159
They cleared something away from here
not minutes ago.

935
01:19:32,338 --> 01:19:33,896
Like what?

936
01:19:34,206 --> 01:19:37,266
Not sure. Something mechanical.

937
01:19:37,443 --> 01:19:39,070
Holmes.

938
01:19:39,712 --> 01:19:41,441
Look at this.

939
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:07,232
-1:18.
-Chapter and verse.

940
01:20:07,406 --> 01:20:11,137
Revelations 1:18.
"I am he that liveth, and was dead."

941
01:20:11,577 --> 01:20:14,569
"And behold, I'm alive for evermore."

942
01:20:15,714 --> 01:20:19,582
I warned you, Holmes, to accept
that this was beyond your control...

943
01:20:19,752 --> 01:20:22,619
beyond what your rational mind
could comprehend.

944
01:20:24,223 --> 01:20:28,182
-What a busy afterlife you're having.
-I want you to bear witness.

945
01:20:28,794 --> 01:20:33,254
Tomorrow, at midday,
the world as you know it will end.

946
01:20:33,432 --> 01:20:35,832
Show me your face,
it'll be the end of your world.

947
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:37,969
Save your bullets, Watson.

948
01:20:38,404 --> 01:20:39,632
A gift for you.

949
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:47,103
What was that about saving bullets?

950
01:20:53,452 --> 01:20:55,818
She followed you here, Holmes.

951
01:20:57,823 --> 01:21:00,724
You led your lamb to slaughter.

952
01:21:03,662 --> 01:21:05,061
Holmes.

953
01:21:06,632 --> 01:21:08,395
This game was designed to hurt.

954
01:21:20,145 --> 01:21:21,476
Watson!

955
01:21:25,718 --> 01:21:26,912
It's warm in here, Watson.

956
01:21:34,226 --> 01:21:35,750
In over your head yet, darling?

957
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:45,364
-Hold on there.
-I can't.

958
01:21:45,538 --> 01:21:47,199
Let me take your weight.

959
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,137
Give us a leg up, old boy.

960
01:21:52,645 --> 01:21:54,442
These German locks
always give me trouble.

961
01:22:00,185 --> 01:22:01,675
It's a band saw.

962
01:22:05,124 --> 01:22:07,115
No matter, we have plenty of time.

963
01:22:08,827 --> 01:22:10,158
Holmes.

964
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:20,295
-It's not working.
-Keep calm.

965
01:22:28,414 --> 01:22:30,245
Holmes, hurry up.

966
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:40,657
Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.

967
01:23:05,751 --> 01:23:07,742
And we'll bounce in 3, 2...

968
01:23:09,154 --> 01:23:10,314
1.

969
01:23:20,933 --> 01:23:22,525
Thank you.

970
01:23:23,002 --> 01:23:24,697
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

971
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:35,979
Thank you.

972
01:23:36,415 --> 01:23:39,009
We should help the doctor.

973
01:23:50,462 --> 01:23:52,123
Holmes!

974
01:25:23,889 --> 01:25:25,686
Mr. Holmes.

975
01:25:27,726 --> 01:25:29,159
Sir.

976
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:34,598
Mr. Holmes.

977
01:25:43,308 --> 01:25:47,176
Mr. Holmes, we have an order
for your arrest, sir.

978
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:52,242
Sir!

979
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:56,080
Lord Coward has issued a warrant
for your arrest, sir.

980
01:25:57,389 --> 01:25:58,879
Now, Watson's alive.

981
01:25:59,057 --> 01:26:01,958
Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go.

982
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:20,110
Will the train be departing on time?

983
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:22,577
The train's been delayed, madam.

984
01:26:22,748 --> 01:26:24,773
Shouldn't be long now, though.

985
01:26:41,099 --> 01:26:44,694
The train will depart when I tell it to.

986
01:26:46,338 --> 01:26:49,637
And you will leave my employment
when I allow you to.

987
01:26:53,979 --> 01:26:56,311
I fulfilled my contract.

988
01:26:56,481 --> 01:26:57,743
I found Reordan.

989
01:26:57,916 --> 01:27:00,077
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

990
01:27:00,252 --> 01:27:02,083
So that's me, finished.

991
01:27:02,254 --> 01:27:06,122
Your job was to manipulate
Holmes' feelings for you...

992
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:07,849
not succumb to them.

993
01:27:10,762 --> 01:27:12,559
You have fulfilled nothing.

994
01:27:12,731 --> 01:27:15,427
I want what Reordan was making
for Blackwood.

995
01:27:16,034 --> 01:27:19,595
Finish the job or the next dead body...

996
01:27:19,771 --> 01:27:22,365
will be Sherlock Holmes.

997
01:27:49,001 --> 01:27:50,969
The surgeon should be along shortly.

998
01:27:55,807 --> 01:27:58,139
He should be able to rest now.

999
01:28:01,246 --> 01:28:02,736
Excuse me.

1000
01:28:06,752 --> 01:28:08,447
Is that the best you can do?

1001
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,485
Yes, for now.

1002
01:28:10,656 --> 01:28:12,749
I must attend to my other patients.

1003
01:28:14,793 --> 01:28:16,192
Doctor.

1004
01:28:16,662 --> 01:28:17,989
Doctor.

1005
01:28:18,764 --> 01:28:20,091
Please.

1006
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:27,334
I know that you care for him
as much as I do.

1007
01:28:27,506 --> 01:28:30,907
This is not your responsibility,
it was his choice.

1008
01:28:31,877 --> 01:28:34,846
He'd say that it was worth the wounds.

1009
01:28:41,453 --> 01:28:43,318
Solve this.

1010
01:28:44,156 --> 01:28:46,181
Whatever it takes.

1011
01:28:56,468 --> 01:28:58,333
This is beyond your control.

1012
01:28:58,503 --> 01:29:00,130
Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic.

1013
01:29:00,305 --> 01:29:03,103
-It's Lord Blackwood, sir.
-I've never been in over my head.

1014
01:29:03,275 --> 01:29:07,143
It's nothing to do with me,
but I advise you leave the case alone.

1015
01:29:07,312 --> 01:29:08,973
-Solve this.
-Are you, Holmes?

1016
01:29:09,147 --> 01:29:11,138
Accept that this was beyond your control.

1017
01:29:11,316 --> 01:29:14,649
-Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end.
-I've got a public in frenzy.

1018
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:16,151
Holmes!

1019
01:29:37,209 --> 01:29:38,836
Widen your gaze.

1020
01:29:39,011 --> 01:29:41,536
You must widen your gaze.
Widen your gaze.

1021
01:29:41,713 --> 01:29:46,150
You and I are bound together on a journey
that will twist the very fabric of nature.

1022
01:29:46,318 --> 01:29:48,411
Steel your mind, Holmes.
Widen your gaze.

1023
01:29:48,587 --> 01:29:50,987
He's gonna raise a force
that will alter the world.

1024
01:29:51,156 --> 01:29:54,023
-His power grows daily.
-This is the source of his power.

1025
01:29:54,192 --> 01:29:55,181
I need you.

1026
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,885
His secret lies in the book of spells.

1027
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:27,988
3 more will die...

1028
01:30:28,593 --> 01:30:31,391
and there is nothing you can do
to save them.

1029
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,430
We know you don't believe in magic.

1030
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,329
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

1031
01:30:37,502 --> 01:30:38,526
Is that better?

1032
01:30:38,703 --> 01:30:41,171
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

1033
01:30:42,407 --> 01:30:46,275
His eyes were wide open
and the only thing missing was his ring.

1034
01:30:53,385 --> 01:30:55,285
Give up, Holmes.

1035
01:30:57,589 --> 01:30:59,989
This is a riddle you cannot solve.

1036
01:31:06,264 --> 01:31:07,492
Good morning.

1037
01:31:11,069 --> 01:31:14,129
Now, you need to work.

1038
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,268
Familiar artwork.

1039
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:20,639
You look gorgeous.

1040
01:31:23,748 --> 01:31:26,114
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1041
01:31:34,025 --> 01:31:35,492
You made the front page.

1042
01:31:35,927 --> 01:31:37,622
Only a name and no picture.

1043
01:31:38,997 --> 01:31:42,956
So it looks like you'll be needing to
work outside the law now...

1044
01:31:43,135 --> 01:31:45,194
and that's my area of expertise.

1045
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:47,304
I feel safer already.

1046
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:51,903
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1047
01:31:53,211 --> 01:31:54,803
Yes.

1048
01:31:55,046 --> 01:31:57,514
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1049
01:31:57,682 --> 01:32:00,549
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1050
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:07,280
Well, I'm...

1051
01:32:07,726 --> 01:32:09,250
I'm just so...

1052
01:32:09,427 --> 01:32:10,985
very glad that you're...

1053
01:32:11,163 --> 01:32:12,562
well...

1054
01:32:12,998 --> 01:32:14,465
with us.

1055
01:32:18,637 --> 01:32:22,971
Now that you're sitting comfortably,
I shall begin.

1056
01:32:23,475 --> 01:32:26,501
My initial approach was far too narrow.

1057
01:32:26,678 --> 01:32:29,146
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1058
01:32:29,314 --> 01:32:32,715
he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

1059
01:32:32,884 --> 01:32:37,912
In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

1060
01:32:39,257 --> 01:32:41,555
But that's for another time.

1061
01:32:41,726 --> 01:32:44,889
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1062
01:32:45,063 --> 01:32:48,362
that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

1063
01:32:48,533 --> 01:32:51,627
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

1064
01:32:51,803 --> 01:32:55,330
I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

1065
01:32:55,507 --> 01:32:57,441
with a few enhancements of my own.

1066
01:32:58,376 --> 01:33:02,403
My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

1067
01:33:02,581 --> 01:33:07,075
and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail,
I have emerged enlightened.

1068
01:33:08,386 --> 01:33:10,911
The fraternity who silently control
the empire...

1069
01:33:11,089 --> 01:33:14,286
share the belief with the kings,
pharaohs and emperors of old...

1070
01:33:14,459 --> 01:33:17,223
that the sphinx was a door
to another dimension...

1071
01:33:17,395 --> 01:33:19,488
a gateway to immeasurable power.

1072
01:33:19,664 --> 01:33:23,395
It's made up of 4 parts:
the foot of a lion, the tail of an ox...

1073
01:33:23,568 --> 01:33:25,934
the wings of an eagle,
and the head of a man.

1074
01:33:26,738 --> 01:33:29,673
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...

1075
01:33:29,841 --> 01:33:32,901
the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle
and hair of a man.

1076
01:33:33,078 --> 01:33:34,443
Map.

1077
01:33:38,283 --> 01:33:41,150
The points of the star represent
the 5 murdered girls...

1078
01:33:41,319 --> 01:33:44,254
but the cross
is what we're now interested in.

1079
01:33:44,522 --> 01:33:45,819
It's a widely held belief...

1080
01:33:45,991 --> 01:33:49,358
that within the architecture
of the great cities...

1081
01:33:49,527 --> 01:33:52,257
are coded references to this system.

1082
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:55,422
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed 3 men...

1083
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:59,092
each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

1084
01:33:59,271 --> 01:34:00,636
therefore the system.

1085
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,635
Reordan, the ginger midget,
represents man.

1086
01:34:04,809 --> 01:34:06,800
We found his body here.

1087
01:34:07,445 --> 01:34:10,642
Sir Thomas, master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1088
01:34:11,616 --> 01:34:13,140
He died here.

1089
01:34:14,019 --> 01:34:15,611
Standish, ambassador to America...

1090
01:34:15,787 --> 01:34:18,915
where the eagle has been
the national emblem for over 100 years.

1091
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:23,151
The headquarters of the Temple
of the Four Orders where he died...

1092
01:34:23,328 --> 01:34:25,592
is here.

1093
01:34:26,264 --> 01:34:29,597
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1094
01:34:29,768 --> 01:34:32,601
So we have man, the ox, eagle.

1095
01:34:33,505 --> 01:34:34,665
Only the lion remaining.

1096
01:34:34,839 --> 01:34:35,999
Right here.

1097
01:34:38,677 --> 01:34:39,837
Parliament.

1098
01:34:44,716 --> 01:34:46,149
Right.

1099
01:34:46,318 --> 01:34:49,879
You 4 stay here and the rest
of you come with me.

1100
01:34:50,055 --> 01:34:52,922
-Get out of the way, you lowlifes!
-Right this way.

1101
01:34:56,394 --> 01:34:58,191
Ladies first.

1102
01:34:58,363 --> 01:34:59,887
Now.

1103
01:35:00,832 --> 01:35:02,129
Follow these instructions.

1104
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:03,824
-Aren't you--?
-Go.

1105
01:35:07,472 --> 01:35:09,633
Hello, hello, hello.

1106
01:35:10,275 --> 01:35:12,402
Did the devil turn up?

1107
01:35:13,645 --> 01:35:15,010
Well...

1108
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,075
never mind.

1109
01:35:17,582 --> 01:35:19,311
You got the next best thing.

1110
01:35:42,574 --> 01:35:46,908
Beg your pardon, my Lord.
I know that it's unorthodox...

1111
01:35:48,113 --> 01:35:49,603
but Mr. Holmes here...

1112
01:35:49,781 --> 01:35:53,444
he's been making some
serious accusations about you...

1113
01:35:54,652 --> 01:35:56,176
and the order.

1114
01:35:58,223 --> 01:35:59,281
I see.

1115
01:35:59,457 --> 01:36:03,621
Well, at least that solves the great mystery
as to how you became inspector.

1116
01:36:08,933 --> 01:36:10,901
Excuse me, my Lord...

1117
01:36:11,436 --> 01:36:13,961
but I've been wanting to do that
for a long time.

1118
01:36:14,139 --> 01:36:17,802
Well, inspector, I have 5 minutes
before my next engagement...

1119
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:21,811
so why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy?

1120
01:36:24,883 --> 01:36:26,373
Thank you, Lestrade.

1121
01:36:26,885 --> 01:36:28,443
My Lord.

1122
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:37,420
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1123
01:36:37,662 --> 01:36:39,596
or just the one I prevented?

1124
01:36:40,765 --> 01:36:43,233
Very distinctive,
those handmade shoes of yours.

1125
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:50,539
But the price of quality
is often the unique imprint they leave.

1126
01:36:51,509 --> 01:36:54,672
Nonetheless, I confess to being
completely outmatched.

1127
01:36:55,413 --> 01:36:58,109
I could deduce very little
from my investigation.

1128
01:36:59,484 --> 01:37:01,679
Fortunately,
there's nothing more stimulating...

1129
01:37:01,853 --> 01:37:04,185
than a case where everything
goes against you.

1130
01:37:04,823 --> 01:37:08,350
How many members of Parliament
do you intend to murder at noon today?

1131
01:37:08,526 --> 01:37:10,118
Man, ox, eagle, lion.

1132
01:37:11,029 --> 01:37:12,587
The lion is Parliament, isn't it?

1133
01:37:15,667 --> 01:37:17,396
Very clever.

1134
01:37:17,802 --> 01:37:20,327
But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes.

1135
01:37:20,505 --> 01:37:22,166
It's mercy.

1136
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,831
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1137
01:37:25,009 --> 01:37:27,477
Don't you see that it's for their own...?

1138
01:37:30,281 --> 01:37:32,977
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1139
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:36,052
I simply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's ceremony...

1140
01:37:36,221 --> 01:37:37,620
and you've given it to me.

1141
01:37:37,789 --> 01:37:38,983
I've told you nothing.

1142
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:42,856
But your clothes say infinitely
more than you could ever hope.

1143
01:37:43,027 --> 01:37:45,791
The mud on your boots
from where you've been walking.

1144
01:37:46,397 --> 01:37:49,730
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.

1145
01:37:51,002 --> 01:37:54,233
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you've been vowing.

1146
01:37:54,405 --> 01:37:58,364
A faint aroma of excrement
from where you've been standing.

1147
01:38:00,645 --> 01:38:03,409
You and Blackwood laid the final touches
to your ceremony...

1148
01:38:03,581 --> 01:38:06,641
in the sewers beneath Parliament
less than an hour ago.

1149
01:38:07,752 --> 01:38:09,720
Both houses meet today.

1150
01:38:10,321 --> 01:38:12,312
The whole government will be present.

1151
01:38:21,699 --> 01:38:24,998
It's a shame you made an enemy
out of Blackwood, Holmes.

1152
01:38:25,703 --> 01:38:27,500
You would have made a valuable ally.

1153
01:38:34,946 --> 01:38:36,846
How terrible is wisdom...

1154
01:38:37,015 --> 01:38:39,882
when it brings no profit to the wise.

1155
01:38:40,618 --> 01:38:42,085
We take power at noon.

1156
01:38:43,087 --> 01:38:45,419
There isn't any time to waste then,
is there?

1157
01:39:12,317 --> 01:39:14,547
I told you he'd be coming
out the top window.

1158
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,210
There isn't any way
he'd be coming over that terrace.

1159
01:39:17,388 --> 01:39:20,221
Technically, that isn't the top window,
is it, sailor boy?

1160
01:39:20,391 --> 01:39:22,882
-What is it?
-Well, it's the middle window.

1161
01:39:23,061 --> 01:39:24,221
Anyway.

1162
01:39:25,296 --> 01:39:27,890
You'll be pleased to know
Lestrade performed perfectly.

1163
01:39:28,066 --> 01:39:29,727
In fact, I think he enjoyed it.

1164
01:39:29,901 --> 01:39:31,596
I hope you know what you're doing.

1165
01:39:32,337 --> 01:39:33,964
Here's the key.

1166
01:39:34,138 --> 01:39:38,006
-You got all you needed from Coward?
-Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease.

1167
01:39:39,377 --> 01:39:40,401
-Tanner?
-Sir?

1168
01:39:40,578 --> 01:39:41,806
If you would, captain...

1169
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:44,813
take us under the bridge,
port side, 100 yards.

1170
01:39:44,983 --> 01:39:48,350
Beyond that you'll find the tunnel
that leads us to the sewers.

1171
01:39:48,519 --> 01:39:49,918
Right away, sir.

1172
01:39:56,694 --> 01:39:58,559
The end is nigh.

1173
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:03,030
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1174
01:40:03,201 --> 01:40:06,796
He walks in every shadow
and every puff of smoke.

1175
01:40:06,971 --> 01:40:09,633
Behold, he cometh with clouds...

1176
01:40:09,807 --> 01:40:12,640
and every eye shall see him...

1177
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:16,405
and every soul shall wail
because of him.

1178
01:40:16,581 --> 01:40:19,573
You cannot stop him!
No one can!

1179
01:40:49,614 --> 01:40:52,082
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.

1180
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:54,582
-What does it do?
-It's a chemical weapon.

1181
01:40:55,353 --> 01:40:56,479
The first of its kind.

1182
01:40:56,654 --> 01:40:58,622
You deduced that how?

1183
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:00,519
From my pocket.

1184
01:41:00,692 --> 01:41:03,684
I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat
at the slaughterhouse.

1185
01:41:03,861 --> 01:41:06,989
Note the blue discoloration,
the faint smell of bitter almonds.

1186
01:41:07,165 --> 01:41:09,258
-Telltale traces of cyanide.
-Cyanide.

1187
01:41:14,038 --> 01:41:16,370
Now we know what the
ginger midget was working on.

1188
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:18,441
It'll revolutionize warfare.

1189
01:41:18,609 --> 01:41:20,133
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1190
01:41:20,311 --> 01:41:22,905
Now, it's 7 minutes to noon.
What are we gonna do?

1191
01:41:24,415 --> 01:41:26,076
Right. How many men
did you count on the--?

1192
01:41:29,687 --> 01:41:31,712
She loves an entrance, your muse.

1193
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,817
Woman!

1194
01:42:04,922 --> 01:42:06,822
Shoot him. Now, please.

1195
01:42:19,203 --> 01:42:20,227
My lords.

1196
01:42:20,872 --> 01:42:21,896
My lords.

1197
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:23,932
My lords.

1198
01:42:24,909 --> 01:42:26,171
The time has come...

1199
01:42:26,344 --> 01:42:28,642
for only those who believe to remain.

1200
01:42:30,515 --> 01:42:31,777
Behold...

1201
01:42:31,949 --> 01:42:33,849
Lord Blackwood.

1202
01:42:46,798 --> 01:42:48,459
You seem surprised.

1203
01:42:51,169 --> 01:42:54,605
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny...

1204
01:42:55,773 --> 01:42:59,539
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1205
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:04,148
Listen to the rabble outside.

1206
01:43:04,816 --> 01:43:06,306
Listen...

1207
01:43:06,484 --> 01:43:07,849
to the fear.

1208
01:43:08,486 --> 01:43:10,147
I will use that as a weapon...

1209
01:43:10,321 --> 01:43:12,255
to control them...

1210
01:43:12,757 --> 01:43:13,985
and then the world.

1211
01:43:18,396 --> 01:43:20,660
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1212
01:43:24,302 --> 01:43:27,294
Specifically designed
to prevent us from disarming it.

1213
01:43:29,974 --> 01:43:32,841
These appear to be designed
to receive a signal of some sort.

1214
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:34,204
Electromagnetic waves?

1215
01:43:34,378 --> 01:43:36,073
When triggered, the electrodes...

1216
01:43:36,247 --> 01:43:38,807
will send a charge
converting the chemical into gas.

1217
01:43:38,983 --> 01:43:42,851
The gas will travel up that shaft
and filter through the ventilation system...

1218
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:45,648
that leads directly to Parliament.
Within seconds...

1219
01:43:45,823 --> 01:43:48,917
the most powerful men in the world
will be choking on death.

1220
01:43:49,093 --> 01:43:52,392
Blackwood must have some transmitter
that he can activate remotely.

1221
01:43:52,563 --> 01:43:54,394
3 minutes, 10 seconds.

1222
01:43:54,832 --> 01:43:58,928
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia...

1223
01:43:59,537 --> 01:44:01,164
indestructible...

1224
01:44:01,339 --> 01:44:02,567
and eternal.

1225
01:44:03,174 --> 01:44:05,005
Move it. Move it.

1226
01:44:05,443 --> 01:44:07,934
We don't actually have to
disarm the device...

1227
01:44:08,112 --> 01:44:11,639
we just have to remove the cylinders.

1228
01:44:11,816 --> 01:44:14,751
Yes, except that they're welded in.

1229
01:44:14,919 --> 01:44:18,047
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1230
01:44:18,222 --> 01:44:21,919
We'll need a container to direct the blast.
My clay pipe should service that ambition.

1231
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:45,208
I rather wish you hadn't done that,
Irene.

1232
01:44:51,522 --> 01:44:56,516
On the 12th chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1233
01:44:57,094 --> 01:45:01,428
All those of you who are with me
shall be protected.

1234
01:45:01,599 --> 01:45:02,657
All others...

1235
01:45:02,833 --> 01:45:04,164
will perish.

1236
01:45:11,409 --> 01:45:13,070
I need your pipe.

1237
01:45:16,747 --> 01:45:18,146
Nut him!

1238
01:45:43,441 --> 01:45:44,874
-Right.
-What?

1239
01:45:45,042 --> 01:45:46,669
-Coat.
-Got it.

1240
01:46:24,915 --> 01:46:26,177
The new order...

1241
01:46:27,651 --> 01:46:28,743
begins now.

1242
01:46:34,892 --> 01:46:35,916
Woman.

1243
01:46:36,761 --> 01:46:38,353
What are you waiting for?

1244
01:46:41,232 --> 01:46:42,460
That.

1245
01:46:53,778 --> 01:46:55,439
Apprehend Lord Coward.

1246
01:46:58,015 --> 01:46:59,880
-Can you manage?
-Course I can.

1247
01:47:26,911 --> 01:47:28,344
Relax...

1248
01:47:28,512 --> 01:47:29,536
I'm a doctor.

1249
01:48:41,719 --> 01:48:44,119
Did you take a wrong turning
somewhere?

1250
01:48:46,157 --> 01:48:47,385
We're safe now.

1251
01:48:48,425 --> 01:48:49,687
Interesting assessment.

1252
01:48:52,263 --> 01:48:53,924
Run off.

1253
01:48:56,167 --> 01:48:57,964
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1254
01:48:59,537 --> 01:49:01,402
Fare thee well.

1255
01:49:06,577 --> 01:49:08,545
I don't want to run anymore.

1256
01:49:11,448 --> 01:49:13,916
-I'll tell you everything.
-I wish you would.

1257
01:49:38,075 --> 01:49:39,269
No!

1258
01:50:45,109 --> 01:50:46,576
There was never any magic.

1259
01:50:48,846 --> 01:50:50,336
Only conjuring tricks.

1260
01:50:54,952 --> 01:50:56,943
The simplest involved
paying people off...

1261
01:50:57,121 --> 01:51:00,386
like the guard who pretended
to be possessed outside your cell.

1262
01:51:00,557 --> 01:51:03,082
Your reputation
and the inmates' fear did the rest.

1263
01:51:04,662 --> 01:51:07,187
Others required
more elaborate preparations...

1264
01:51:07,364 --> 01:51:10,629
like the sandstone slab
that covered your tomb.

1265
01:51:11,602 --> 01:51:15,561
You had it broken before your burial,
then put back together using an adhesive.

1266
01:51:16,907 --> 01:51:19,375
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe...

1267
01:51:19,543 --> 01:51:21,602
a mixture of egg and honey...

1268
01:51:22,279 --> 01:51:24,543
designed to be washed away
by the rain.

1269
01:51:29,553 --> 01:51:30,884
Holmes!

1270
01:51:31,055 --> 01:51:33,785
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub...

1271
01:51:33,957 --> 01:51:35,788
required more modern science.

1272
01:51:35,959 --> 01:51:38,894
Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic...

1273
01:51:39,063 --> 01:51:42,055
that was activated by the combination
of copper and water...

1274
01:51:42,232 --> 01:51:45,565
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1275
01:51:46,403 --> 01:51:48,394
That might've been a challenge for me...

1276
01:51:48,572 --> 01:51:52,133
had he not also tested it
on some unfortunate amphibians.

1277
01:51:56,814 --> 01:51:59,908
The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

1278
01:52:00,084 --> 01:52:03,144
until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1279
01:52:04,488 --> 01:52:06,922
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...

1280
01:52:07,524 --> 01:52:09,651
yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

1281
01:52:11,762 --> 01:52:15,061
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1282
01:52:16,233 --> 01:52:17,700
All it took was a spark.

1283
01:52:22,172 --> 01:52:24,367
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1284
01:52:25,843 --> 01:52:27,276
Ingenious.

1285
01:52:27,444 --> 01:52:30,880
Like all great performers, you saved
your pièce de résistance for the end:

1286
01:52:31,048 --> 01:52:35,849
A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1287
01:52:36,019 --> 01:52:37,543
Had it worked...

1288
01:52:37,721 --> 01:52:40,622
your followers in Parliament
would have watched unharmed...

1289
01:52:40,791 --> 01:52:43,282
as their colleagues
were dying around them.

1290
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:45,451
They didn't know
you'd given them the antidote.

1291
01:52:45,629 --> 01:52:48,029
Instead,
they would've believed it was magic...

1292
01:52:48,198 --> 01:52:50,894
and that you'd harnessed
the ultimate power.

1293
01:52:51,235 --> 01:52:54,932
And the world would've followed,
fear being the most powerful weapon of all.

1294
01:52:56,907 --> 01:52:59,808
You'd better hope
that it's nothing more than superstition...

1295
01:52:59,977 --> 01:53:02,138
as you performed
all the rituals perfectly.

1296
01:53:02,946 --> 01:53:04,914
The devil is due a soul, I'd say.

1297
01:53:07,217 --> 01:53:09,310
For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose.

1298
01:53:20,097 --> 01:53:23,726
First, the world will see you
for what you are. A fraud.

1299
01:53:25,335 --> 01:53:26,632
Then you'll be hanged.

1300
01:53:26,804 --> 01:53:28,669
Properly, this time.

1301
01:53:28,839 --> 01:53:30,932
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1302
01:54:22,292 --> 01:54:25,193
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1303
01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:27,754
I have.

1304
01:54:29,066 --> 01:54:30,624
Naked.

1305
01:54:34,605 --> 01:54:36,732
Storm's coming.

1306
01:54:37,007 --> 01:54:40,568
Well, we've still got a moment.

1307
01:54:44,548 --> 01:54:45,810
Moriarty.

1308
01:54:45,983 --> 01:54:47,416
What?

1309
01:54:47,584 --> 01:54:49,552
That's his name.

1310
01:54:50,153 --> 01:54:52,314
And he is a professor.

1311
01:54:54,458 --> 01:54:56,517
Everyone has a weak spot...

1312
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,190
and he found mine.

1313
01:55:00,631 --> 01:55:02,565
Where was it, precisely?

1314
01:55:13,477 --> 01:55:16,071
Please don't underestimate him.

1315
01:55:16,747 --> 01:55:19,147
He's just as brilliant as you are...

1316
01:55:19,316 --> 01:55:21,546
and infinitely more devious.

1317
01:55:21,718 --> 01:55:23,913
We'll see about that.

1318
01:55:26,050 --> 01:55:31,850
Subtitles: Arigon

1319
01:55:40,404 --> 01:55:42,804
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1320
01:55:44,775 --> 01:55:46,470
Sadly...

1321
01:55:47,077 --> 01:55:48,738
yes.

1322
01:56:14,104 --> 01:56:15,935
Just keep it under your hat.

1323
01:56:16,106 --> 01:56:19,041
Afternoon, sir.
I put the notebooks in this one, sir.

1324
01:56:19,209 --> 01:56:21,143
-Thank you.
-What's in these, John?

1325
01:56:21,311 --> 01:56:22,335
Scribbles.

1326
01:56:22,512 --> 01:56:24,002
-Scribbles?
-Notes.

1327
01:56:24,181 --> 01:56:26,843
They're your adventures.
I'd like to read them.

1328
01:56:33,690 --> 01:56:35,021
Come on, what's wrong?

1329
01:56:35,192 --> 01:56:37,717
Do you think he's come to terms
with you leaving?

1330
01:56:37,894 --> 01:56:41,261
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1331
01:56:41,898 --> 01:56:44,196
Now, 5 minutes here
and we'll go home.

1332
01:56:44,368 --> 01:56:45,733
Our home.

1333
01:56:45,902 --> 01:56:47,563
Get up those stairs.

1334
01:56:55,479 --> 01:56:57,037
Don't worry, dear.

1335
01:56:57,214 --> 01:56:59,273
Suicide is not in his repertoire.

1336
01:56:59,449 --> 01:57:01,747
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1337
01:57:02,352 --> 01:57:04,013
Holmes.

1338
01:57:05,956 --> 01:57:07,783
Good afternoon.

1339
01:57:07,958 --> 01:57:12,054
I was trying to deduce the manner
in which Blackwood survived his execution.

1340
01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:14,288
Clearing your good name, as it were.

1341
01:57:14,631 --> 01:57:17,156
But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect...

1342
01:57:17,334 --> 01:57:21,031
and I was carried off in the arms
of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.

1343
01:57:21,204 --> 01:57:22,569
Good afternoon, dear.

1344
01:57:22,739 --> 01:57:24,400
Get on with it, Holmes.

1345
01:57:24,574 --> 01:57:28,237
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot
was a hook.

1346
01:57:28,712 --> 01:57:31,381
Dear, my legs have fallen asleep.
I should come down.

1347
01:57:31,548 --> 01:57:33,140
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1348
01:57:33,316 --> 01:57:35,750
No, no, no,
I hate to cut him off midstream.

1349
01:57:35,919 --> 01:57:37,045
Carry on.

1350
01:57:38,121 --> 01:57:40,783
Well, the executioner
attached it to a harness...

1351
01:57:40,957 --> 01:57:43,721
allowing the weight to be
distributed around the waist...

1352
01:57:43,894 --> 01:57:45,953
and the neck to remain intact.

1353
01:57:46,129 --> 01:57:49,565
My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks.
Might we continue this at ground level?

1354
01:57:49,733 --> 01:57:51,360
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1355
01:57:52,002 --> 01:57:55,199
I managed it with braces,
belts and a coat hook.

1356
01:57:56,173 --> 01:57:59,040
Please, my tongue is going,
I'll be of no use to you at all.

1357
01:57:59,209 --> 01:58:00,904
-Worse things could happen.
-John.

1358
01:58:03,747 --> 01:58:06,875
Yet none of this explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1359
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:08,415
Right.

1360
01:58:08,585 --> 01:58:13,887
Now, the medical mystery.
We must restore your reputation, Watson.

1361
01:58:14,057 --> 01:58:17,686
There is a toxin refined from the nectar
of the rhododendron ponticum.

1362
01:58:17,861 --> 01:58:20,921
It's infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea...

1363
01:58:21,098 --> 01:58:24,590
for its ability to induce
an apparently mortal paralysis.

1364
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:28,204
Enough to mislead a medical mind
even as well-trained as your own.

1365
01:58:28,371 --> 01:58:30,703
-It's known as--
-What's wrong with Gladstone?

1366
01:58:30,874 --> 01:58:32,739
mad honey disease.

1367
01:58:33,209 --> 01:58:36,709
He's demonstrating the very
effect I've just described.

1368
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:38,411
He doesn't mind.

1369
01:58:40,984 --> 01:58:43,384
Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse.

1370
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:45,385
Mr. Holmes?

1371
01:58:47,691 --> 01:58:48,919
Doctor. Miss Mary.

1372
01:58:49,659 --> 01:58:52,753
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that
you come with me right away.

1373
01:58:53,296 --> 01:58:56,629
-What is it is this time, Clarkie?
-It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1374
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,394
He went missing
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.

1375
01:58:59,569 --> 01:59:03,164
I'm afraid sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir.

1376
01:59:03,607 --> 01:59:06,667
We believe the sergeant
was our first man on the scene.

1377
01:59:06,843 --> 01:59:08,606
Can I help you, officer?

1378
01:59:09,379 --> 01:59:10,403
Shot in the head.

1379
01:59:12,082 --> 01:59:13,811
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1380
01:59:14,951 --> 01:59:16,282
Yes.

1381
01:59:17,788 --> 01:59:20,052
Were there powder burns
on his eyebrows?

1382
01:59:20,223 --> 01:59:21,884
Indeed, sir.

1383
01:59:24,027 --> 01:59:25,358
Point blank range?

1384
01:59:25,529 --> 01:59:26,757
Moriarty.

1385
01:59:28,198 --> 01:59:30,325
Professor Moriarty.

1386
01:59:33,203 --> 01:59:34,837
There's a good boy.

1387
01:59:35,005 --> 01:59:36,597
Everything's gonna be fine.

1388
01:59:37,808 --> 01:59:39,469
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1389
01:59:39,643 --> 01:59:42,703
Secret Service have it, sir.
They've taken over the case.

1390
01:59:43,213 --> 01:59:45,408
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1391
01:59:47,384 --> 01:59:50,410
So Moriarty was after
a piece of the machine...

1392
01:59:51,021 --> 01:59:52,283
not the poison.

1393
01:59:52,455 --> 01:59:54,889
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1394
01:59:55,058 --> 01:59:57,492
The wire-free invention
was the game all along.

1395
01:59:57,661 --> 02:00:00,129
And Adler was just the diversion.

1396
02:00:00,297 --> 02:00:02,925
He knew I'd chase her,
leaving the machine accessible.

1397
02:00:03,099 --> 02:00:06,967
A technology of that kind
would be worth an untold fortune.

1398
02:00:07,137 --> 02:00:09,435
Imagine being able
to control any device...

1399
02:00:09,606 --> 02:00:13,269
simply by sending a command
via radio waves.

1400
02:00:14,044 --> 02:00:16,069
It's the future, Watson.

1401
02:00:18,348 --> 02:00:20,816
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1402
02:00:24,154 --> 02:00:25,712
Well...

1403
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:30,082
-Gladstone.
-Stop him before he gets to the front door.

1404
02:00:30,527 --> 02:00:31,960
Clarkie.

1405
02:00:34,197 --> 02:00:36,028
Case reopened.

1406
