2
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,252
- Hi.
- Hi, Warren.
George Kelly called us in.

3
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:04,749
Uh, he wants to waive the 24-hour rule.
Make it ourjurisdiction,
at least informally.

4
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:08,590
The guy in the pyjamas is Mr Berger.
He owns the place.

5
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:12,546
Mr Berger, this is Special Agent
Stantin ofthe FBl.

6
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:17,303
Mr Berger, I don't believe
you're stealing your own diamonds...

7
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:19,934
Ieast ofall,
not in your pyjamas.

8
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:23,227
Why the heck don't you tell us
what's going on here?

9
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,981
This is my store. I was taking
some diamonds home-- my diamonds!

10
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,942
You have no right to be here!
I want to leave now.

11
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:35,452
Do you usually take two pounds
ofdiamonds home with you like this?

12
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,031
I can do whatever I like
with my own stones!

13
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:40,582
I want to leave right now!

14
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:49,260
Mrs Berger is listed as co-owner.
Why don't we call her
and have her meet us downtown.

15
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:53,558
No, no, you mustn't do that!
Please, don't do that! Please!

16
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,011
Where is your wife, Mr Berger?

17
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:14,866
Please, for God's sake,
help me.

18
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:17,495
He made us watch him
kill our dog.

19
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:21,036
He said he would
kill my wife next.

20
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:35,010
Get up there.

21
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:57,246
- Hello?
- Mrs Berger?

22
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:00,668
Please don't be alarmed.
You're going to be all right.

23
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:03,127
I'm here with your husband.

24
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:07,510
Now, please, let me speak
with the man there with you.

25
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,507
- Mrs Berger?
- Yes?

26
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:16,223
Hit the lights.

27
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:20,392
This is Special Agent Stantin
ofthe FBl.

28
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:23,236
You can see that the house
is completely surrounded.

29
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,156
We have Mr Berger and
the diamonds in our custody.

30
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,490
I'm going to give you some instructions.
Ifyou follow them exactly...

31
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:32,661
no harm will come to you,
understand?

32
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:34,740
Tellthepolice
to holdtheirfire.

33
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:39,625
I'm sending out the maid
with a message foryou.

34
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:43,248
Okay, hold your fiîre.
The maid's coming out.

35
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:45,797
Holdyourfire.

36
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,825
Stantin?

37
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,710
Didyouget the message?

38
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:24,546
MrsBerger'sMercedes
isparkedin the driveway.

39
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:28,467
Stockit with onepolice radio
andapairofhandcuffs...

40
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:33,301
orlpromiseyou,
this woman's deadin one minute.

41
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:37,013
You take one car.
You alone.

42
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,265
Have the diamonds withyou.

43
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,111
Tailme to where
mypeople meet me.

44
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,484
I'llmakesureyou're alone.

45
00:07:44,573 --> 00:07:47,657
Then we'llmake the trade.

46
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:51,782
- No deal.
- You'vegot no choice, Stantin.

47
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,957
She'sgot30seconds left.

48
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:07,131
Who's your best sharpshooter?

49
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:11,006
- I am.
- Good.

50
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:15,264
You're gonna have to nail this guy
before he gets to that Mercedes.

51
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,290
The items you requested
are in the car.

52
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:14,239
Shit!
Son ofa bitch!

53
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:18,832
That's one smart fucker.

54
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:24,878
Get me a civilian CB radio, fast!

55
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,735
Just plug this into
the cigarette lighter.

56
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:52,661
We've banned all CB use
on channel 30 for two hours.

57
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:57,661
He spots one ofour tails,
and we've had it. Tell them not--
not to take any chances.

58
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:00,127
Right.

59
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:05,459
Stantin, doyou have the diamonds?

60
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:08,639
- Yes.
- Good.

61
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:12,141
Nowmoveyourpeople back.

62
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:16,012
Ifanyone besidesyou
tries to followme...

63
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:18,230
Ikillthe woman.

64
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,442
They're moving back now.

65
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:27,909
Iflhearanybody's voice
on this radio butyours...

66
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,153
Iswearto God, she's dead.

67
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:38,211
Pull back! Let 'em through!
Everybody! Pull it way back-- way back!

68
00:10:39,757 --> 00:10:43,423
That's an order! No one fiîres!
We're letting 'em out of here.
We're lettin' 'em out.

69
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:45,753
Let'sgo fora ride.

70
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,756
Okay, here they come.

71
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,354
Back it up!
Okay, here they come!

72
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:56,808
No one fiîre.
Just watch him leave.

73
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,818
Here we go now.
Back it up!

74
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,231
- Move it back! Move it back!
- Here we go. Here we go!

75
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:12,244
That's our second time
around the block.

76
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,659
The dumb bastard's lost.

77
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:18,585
No, he's not.
He'sjust trying to shake our tail.

78
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,749
I think he's going to double back
towards the water.

79
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:23,760
Get your police boats ready
and alert the coast guard.

80
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,581
Stop the carhere.

81
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:03,423
We're at pier 99.
He's got to have a boat waiting for him.

82
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:12,059
Try lining up a shot
out the window over my shoulder.

83
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:14,768
Stay low.

84
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:23,776
Allright.
So far, sogood.

85
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,951
Now, turnyourradio up.
Put on the externalspeaker.

86
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,991
Get out ofthe car, bring the diamonds
halfway down thepier.

87
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,665
- Have you got a shot?
- Maybe.

88
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,326
He's right on the edge.

89
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,087
If I'm a quarter ofan inch out,
I could hit the woman.

90
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,422
Too risky.

91
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,091
I'll try to draw him out.

92
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,515
Ifyou're absolutely sure, take a shot,
but only ifyou're absolutely sure.

93
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:19,257
Stop.
Throwthe diamonds to the car.

94
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:23,709
First, send Mrs Berger to me.

95
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:28,882
Bullshit!lknowyou'vegot a sniper
waiting there formesomewhere.

96
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:32,097
I'mgoing to keep MrsBerger
right here in front ofme.

97
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:35,772
Now, you throwme
thosegoddam diamonds.

98
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:45,911
Jesus Christ!
That'sasfarasyou can throw?

99
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:49,614
Get back toyourcar.
Move!

100
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:45,387
Hey, you!

101
00:14:48,478 --> 00:14:50,803
Yes?

102
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:54,313
You've made thisa hellof
a lot harderthan it hadto be.

103
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:57,936
Now, I've handcuffedMrsBerger
to the endofthepier.

104
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:00,568
You wait formysignal.

105
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:03,445
Thenyou move in
andpickherup.

106
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,991
Understand?

107
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,653
Understood.

108
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:11,323
Idon't thinkyou do.

109
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:34,349
Speedboat heading for Oakland!
Move in! Move in!

110
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:04,307
- Go! Go!
- Let's go!

111
00:16:15,152 --> 00:16:17,229
He's on radar, heading 022.

112
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:24,118
We lost him!

113
00:16:24,204 --> 00:16:26,659
Where is he?

114
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:37,038
Over there.

115
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,889
Flight 005,
San Francisco to Paris.

116
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,813
- The one with
the unidentifiîed passenger.
- Yes?

117
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:34,394
- A 1 2-year-old girl travelling
on her mother's passport.
- Okay.

118
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:39,860
Let's check the flights that left
after we covered the airport,
just in case our boy slipped through.

119
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,070
The only makeable prints
belong to the maid and the family.

120
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,329
And the lab will have the fiîbre analysis
for us in a few hours.

121
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:49,535
Okay. Thankyou.
What have you got?

122
00:17:49,627 --> 00:17:52,794
I've called up every kidnap/extortion
in the last fiîve years.

123
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,415
267 possible match ups
with our MO.

124
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,843
It's as narrow as the computer goes
with the information we have.

125
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,880
Then use the telephone.
Call the investigating offiîcer
in each ofthose cases.

126
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:06,514
Tell him what we have,
and see ifanything strikes a chord.

127
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:10,897
We don't have the manpower to recheck
the airports and make those phone calls.

128
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:15,775
Round up eight other agents.
That's 27 phone calls apiece.
Start with homicides.

129
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:19,564
He used a 9mm automatic. Check that
against the suspect's profiîle.

130
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,998
Caucasian, male, 20 to 40--
I promise you, this guy's killed before.

131
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,659
It was too easy for him.

132
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:33,538
It's been 1 2 hours. I thinkyou should
shut it down and get some sleep.

133
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:36,549
- I feel fiîne.
- You feel like shit.

134
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:41,297
Look, I read all the reports. There's no
possible way you could have fiîgured out
what was gonna happen last night.

135
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,432
- What are you saying, Charlie?
- I'm saying that it happens.

136
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,304
It happened to me.
Remember that kid in Sausalito?

137
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:54,528
Look, sometimes you lose a hostage,
and there's not a damn thing
you can do about it.

138
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:57,566
I know the speech, Charlie.
I wrote it.

139
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:00,231
Come on.
Walk me out.

140
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:05,534
Warren, you're letting this thing get
to you. You're taking it to heart.

141
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:09,704
You're saying, "Maybe I could have
done this. Maybe that."

142
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:14,256
The point is, you did everything
correctly, and that's all
anyone can ask ofyou.

143
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:16,963
Now, go home.
Get some sleep.

144
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:19,045
I'll call you when I get to DC.

145
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:23,432
Okay.
Have a nice trip.

146
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:27,681
- We've started doing
those phone calls now.
- Good.

147
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:31,900
-Do you want us to call you at home?
-I'm not going home. I'll be right here.

148
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,195
Good mornin'.
Nice day for fiîshin'.

149
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:05,704
I guess we must be
the fiîrst ones here, huh?

150
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:09,920
Yes, I know it's happened before.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't
call the restaurant.

151
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:14,252
But we've been in the middle
ofa terrible situation.

152
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:18,257
Yes, I'm sure it was
terrible foryou too, honey.

153
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:22,594
I'll try.
No, I can't promise, but I will try.

154
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:26,137
Baby, I gotta go.

155
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,437
Bishop's Falls, Washington.
Sheriff reports the murder ofa tourist
just offthe highway into Canada.

156
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:36,443
- So?
- Large calibre wound through
the victim's left eye.

157
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:40,444
Where the hell is Bishop's Falls?

158
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:44,998
It's right over here,
uh, to the northwest ofSpokane.

159
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,832
Book me on the next flight to Spokane.
And while I'm in the air, fiîgure out
a way to get me to Bishop's Falls.

160
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:55,945
Crilly here found the body.
Agent Stantin, Austin Crilly.
Stantin's the FBI man, Crilly.

161
00:22:56,033 --> 00:23:00,031
- It's up this way.
- Are you really a G-man?

162
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:05,246
- The last I looked.
- Yeah, well, I'm a caretaker
hereabouts, since the mine closed--
-Jesus, Crilly.

163
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:11,124
Yeah, I'm getting to it, Dave.
So, I seen where the gate was bent up
there, so I went to snoopin' around.

164
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:15,843
And Judas Priest,
there's this body lying there,
flies as big as Chevys and--

165
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,464
Who do those cars belong to,
Mr. Crilly?

166
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:24,386
Well, sportin' folks-- uh, fiîshermen.
They head out from here
and gather above.

167
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,351
See, the guide meets them
up above at a base camp.

168
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:32,898
- Bishop's Falls Guide Service,
Jonathan Knox and Sarah Renell.
- You really a G-man?

169
00:23:32,989 --> 00:23:37,651
See, this area is known to be
the greatest high-mountain
fly fiîshing in the world.

170
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:53,631
That's how we found him--
buck naked and his eye shot out.

171
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:58,097
He was killed outside,
then dragged in here by his heels.

172
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,102
The killer wrapped this
around the victim's head
before pulling off his clothes.

173
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:09,899
- Why would he do that?
- He didn't want to get any
bloodstains on the garment.

174
00:24:09,986 --> 00:24:14,316
We have to assume the murderer
wore the victim's clothes out of here,
right down to the underwear.

175
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:16,696
- Holy shit.
- Hey, don't step there.

176
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:18,778
What?

177
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,992
What's that?

178
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:28,170
- Burnt hair.
- What does that mean?

179
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:33,961
All we know about our boy is that he has
long hair and a beard. And this is it.

180
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:41,844
Sam!

181
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,598
Sam!

182
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:51,355
Howdy, Sheriff. What's the matter?
You look all shook up.

183
00:24:51,447 --> 00:24:55,610
Sam, we need a description ofthose men
who left in that fiîshing party
from the mine yesterday.

184
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:57,908
Oh, I don't know
any ofthem by sight. Why?

185
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:00,996
- You don't meet these people?
- No, not often.

186
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:05,162
They go straight to the staging area
above the mine. Is somethin' wrong?

187
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:10,627
- How many are up there in this party?
- Five fiîshermen, one guide.
Sarah-- Sarah Renell.

188
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,382
- Dave, what's goin' on?
- Can we contact them?
This Sarah, does she carry a radio?

189
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,136
Oh, there's radios in the huts
along the way.

190
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,261
Yeah, they were supposed to call me
from Timber Falls.

191
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,262
And they didn't?

192
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,514
They could be anywhere in here.

193
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:30,400
See, sometimes they go
into places nobody's been before.
Jonathan will know.

194
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:33,524
- And the border isjust there.
- That's right.

195
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,448
I've got the county
fiîre and rescue chopper standing by.

196
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:41,535
No, that would tip the killer off
that we're searching for him.
Too dangerous.

197
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:45,124
Couldn't use a helicopter
even ifyou wanted.
A storm comin' in-- too much wind shear.

198
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:48,166
- And no roads?
- Not a one.

199
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:58,390
- Who could guide me in there?
-Jon Knox is the man you want. He's
Sarah's partner, I guess you'd call him.

200
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:04,727
Mr Stantin, please, listen. Sarah--
she's kind ofspecial around here.

201
00:26:04,816 --> 00:26:08,267
Do you really think he'd kill
any more ofthose people?

202
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:12,275
Yes, I do, Mr. Baker.

203
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:15,402
Imagine living
your whole life out here...

204
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:18,863
so far away from people.

205
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:21,873
Well, it's a good thing there's
a godforsaken wilderness somewhere...

206
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:24,876
'cause it's the only place
thatJon Knox would fiît in.

207
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:28,295
Just what I need--
another psycho.

208
00:26:28,382 --> 00:26:31,751
Oh,Jon's all right.
He'sjust different.

209
00:26:31,844 --> 00:26:34,300
He doesn't feel real comfortable
with people.

210
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:36,796
He lives back in those hills
like a hermit.

211
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:40,841
Then Sarah came along. In about
fiîve minutes, they fell in love.

212
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:44,104
Fell in love?

213
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,646
That makes things more complicated.

214
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,343
Jon, it's Dave Arnett.

215
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:17,467
I've got Warren Stantin ofthe FBI
in San Francisco with me.

216
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,351
Mr. Knox, I know this is
a diffiîcult time foryou, but I think
we can work together and we--

217
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:30,646
Mr. Knox, I'm in pursuit ofa kidnap
and murder suspect. I need a guide.

218
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:32,779
Get your hand off me.

219
00:27:35,077 --> 00:27:39,206
- I understand you're the best.
- Find someone else.

220
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,039
Now, you listen to me, Knox.
You are going with me.

221
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:46,247
Ifyou refuse to assist a federal agent
in the pursuit ofa felon...

222
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:49,708
you will be arrested
for obstruction ofjustice.

223
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,043
Get out of my way.

224
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,046
- You're under arrest!
- Bullshit.

225
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:57,093
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Move! I go alone.

226
00:27:57,184 --> 00:28:00,220
Jon, the man has the right.

227
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,519
He ain't gonna make it out there, Dave.
He's only gonna get in my way.

228
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,729
Don't bet on it.

229
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,491
Ain't no elevators
out there, mister--

230
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:14,777
no cable cars, no busses,
no damn taxicabs.

231
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,906
So why don't you settle your ass at
the motel, and I'll do what I do best.

232
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:21,201
Mr Knox, you've got one choice
and one choice only.

233
00:28:21,293 --> 00:28:23,748
That is to guide me
into those mountains.

234
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:28,998
That is the one way-- the only way you
will be permitted to help your friend.

235
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:32,877
You're not a vigilante.
You will be acting under my authority--

236
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:35,297
under my orders!

237
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:37,799
Questions so far?

238
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,933
Good. And I don't give a rat's ass
whetheryou like it or not.

239
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:49,233
You try going after this guy alone
and your ass will be in jail so fast
your head will spin.

240
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:53,734
Is any ofthis
getting through to you, Mr Knox?

241
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:03,830
- Where's his gear?
- In the truck.

242
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:37,069
- What the hell are these?
- Battery-powered, heated socks--
the latest thing.

243
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:40,580
- Ed Miller sell him this stuff?
- Yeah.

244
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:43,040
It fiîgures.

245
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:51,591
- Ninety-eight bottles
ofbeeron the wall
- Ninety-eight. Ninety-eight.

246
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,672
- Ninety-eight bottles ofbeer
- That's right!

247
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:57,893
You take one down, youpass it around
Ninety-seven bottles ofbeeron the wall

248
00:29:57,978 --> 00:30:00,184
Ninety-seven bottles
ofbeeron the wall

249
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:03,107
- Ninety-seven bottles
- Come on, I'm dying. I'm dying.

250
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:05,398
Wait.
Let's not get sidetracked.

251
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:09,863
- No, let's play,
"What's My Line," all right? Huh?
- Ilove aparade

252
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:12,155
What'd you say you did?

253
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:17,368
I work with a moving company.
You know, furniture, household goods,
that sort ofthing. How about you?

254
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:20,791
You know, business-- this and that.
You make a buck.

255
00:30:20,877 --> 00:30:23,451
Like what, over the counter,
wholesale, computers, what?

256
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:27,082
-Hey, you make a buck. Who gives a shit?
-I'm just asking the guy
what he does, guys.

257
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:30,758
- Go, go, go.
- I have an inquiring mind.
- Do you wanna talk about something else
like lures or something?

258
00:30:30,846 --> 00:30:35,175
Okay, you guys, we're gonna stop here
for a fiîve-minute break.

259
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:38,636
Take offyour packs
and relax a while.

260
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:41,137
You guys look a little winded.

261
00:30:41,232 --> 00:30:45,396
I want you to stop before you can't talk
without gasping for air, okay?

262
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:49,650
Hey, Ben, don't get so close
to the edge there.

263
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:53,110
- This is not a good place
to go river rafting.
- Oh, hold on. Here you go.

264
00:30:53,203 --> 00:30:57,153
You know what I'm saying?
I can't get this thing off my back.

265
00:30:57,249 --> 00:31:01,994
It feels like somebody swapped out a
Cadillac and slipped it inside my pack.

266
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:04,839
Don't you boy scouts know better
than to be heroes?

267
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:07,711
Sarah, my boots are killing me.

268
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:12,345
Loosen up the laces a little bit.
Don't take 'em off,
'cause you won't get 'em back on.

269
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:16,299
- Okay.
- How you doing, Harv?

270
00:31:16,394 --> 00:31:18,802
- I'll live.
- Good.

271
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:21,566
I hope.

272
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:25,861
Hey, Sarah, when are we gonna come
across a radio that works?

273
00:31:25,946 --> 00:31:29,279
- What was wrong with the radio
at the last hut?
- It was busted.

274
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:33,909
- What do you need a radio for?
- Weather forecast.

275
00:31:33,996 --> 00:31:38,907
My knee got pretty banged up
in football. Now it tells me when
the weather's gonna change.

276
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:42,287
We're gonna be at a lodge tomorrow
night. We'll have a roofand a radio.

277
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,289
Sounds good to me.

278
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:48,462
The last time my knee felt like this,
it rained for three straight days.

279
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:51,009
Best fiîshing, though,
in the rain.

280
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:54,716
My last trip,
I latched onto a river...

281
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:59,222
that was full ofthe biggest steelhead
you've ever seen in your life.

282
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:02,101
-You know how spooky steelhead are, huh?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

283
00:32:02,192 --> 00:32:06,190
The slightest little sound
and they're gone. Now, is this
gonna be another wild fiîsh story, Ben?

284
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,492
- That's right, my friend.
And on this particular day,
it was coming down in buckets.
- You okay, Norm?

285
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:14,823
- Uh, where-- where was this?
- What?

286
00:32:14,914 --> 00:32:17,239
Where was it?
What-What-What river?

287
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,119
It was the-- the Fraser.

288
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:24,249
Up in BC--
British Columbia.

289
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:31,221
- Anyway--
- So, uh, you've never been
on one ofthese trips, huh?

290
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:33,632
No. No, I always fiîgured
the wilderness...

291
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:38,222
was the botanical gardens
in the Bronx.

292
00:32:38,314 --> 00:32:41,149
What brings you
on this trip now?

293
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:47,781
I just fiînished going through
a really ugly divorce...

294
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,356
and I was looking for
a vacation spot...

295
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,156
where I was sure
I wouldn't run into my ex.

296
00:32:53,246 --> 00:32:58,786
And since she's never been
away from room service
for more than a minute in her life--

297
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,712
You picked a great spot.

298
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:08,878
The sound ofthe water
is kind of lulling the steelhead...

299
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:12,174
and the action on the river...

300
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:14,342
is kind of bringing them up
close to the surface.

301
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:17,851
How big do these, uh,
Fraser River steelhead get, huh?

302
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:20,691
What's up with you
and the questions?

303
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:24,025
They're this big, okay? Does that make
you happy? Can I go on with the story?

304
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:16,459
You can turn back any time.

305
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:19,413
You worry about your own ass, hmm?

306
00:34:40,317 --> 00:34:42,357
Easy. There, there.

307
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:45,481
Don't get excited.
Don't get excited.

308
00:34:57,127 --> 00:35:00,211
No. No, the other way.
Wrong way.

309
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:03,298
Whoa. Hey, hey, U-U-turn!

310
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:06,337
Hey, hey, hey, you stop this shit now.
Wait. Wait.

311
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:40,542
What have you got?
Hello?

312
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:44,759
Earth to Knox, do you read me?
What's happening?

313
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:48,426
End ofthe trail foryou, partner.
She's taken the route to Ryan's Gorge.

314
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,219
- The horses can't make it there.
- Good.

315
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:54,014
If I never see another horse...

316
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:57,722
if I never ride another horse,
if I never smell another horse--

317
00:35:57,815 --> 00:36:00,389
no offence, horse--
it would be too soon.

318
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:05,443
Hey, I ain't taking
no tenderfoot trails. So you
might as well turn back right now.

319
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:10,527
Maybe you're forgetting
what I said back there.
This man is mine. You understand?

320
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:13,491
Now, what do we do with the horses?

321
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,893
Okay, horsey--

322
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:46,315
Home! Home!

323
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:19,725
Whoa! Whoa!

324
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:45,758
- Better walk in the stream a bit.
- What'd you say?

325
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,804
Helps to break 'em in.
Walk 'em out wet.

326
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,262
You're bullshitting me, right?

327
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,151
Weird shit in the country.

328
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:14,749
- Son ofa bitch.
- What'd you say?

329
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:17,789
I said,
"I hate the damn woods!"

330
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:48,783
You're looking at that moss like
it's gonna sing to you. Or are you
saying your prayers? Come on, will you.

331
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:53,616
Look, mister, you might be
some hot shit on your turf,
but this is my territory.

332
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:56,960
So why don't you just
sit back and enjoy the ride.

333
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,485
See the moose?

334
00:40:14,169 --> 00:40:16,838
- So the doctor hears
this terrible screaming.
- Another doctor story.

335
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:22,343
-He runs back into the examining room.
-Do you believe this guy?
-He takes one look and he says, "No, no,
nurse. I told you to prick his boil."

336
00:40:22,428 --> 00:40:25,631
- Come on!
- Oh, I heard that when I was 1 2.
- I heard that when I was two.

337
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,799
All right, I got another one here.
Now, the old man--

338
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:32,768
- No, no, no, Ralphie. No more. No more.
- Let's talk about fiîshing
or anything, please!

339
00:40:32,855 --> 00:40:37,814
- Hey, Sarah,
Normie's slowing down again.
- Norm, you all right?

340
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,272
Yeah, I'm actually starting
to like it up here, you know.

341
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:46,110
- Hey, did you guys see the view?
- Come on!

342
00:40:46,203 --> 00:40:49,038
So what do you think?
Fifty bucks for the biggest fiîsh?

343
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:52,574
You make it a C-note,
and you got yourselfa deal, big guy.

344
00:40:52,668 --> 00:40:56,286
- Yeah, but I wanna
see the lure fiîrst.
- I'll give you a lure right here.

345
00:40:59,675 --> 00:41:02,345
I can't believe
I'm out ofshape.

346
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:06,131
Is this thing
safe enough to step on?

347
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,592
- I like this.
- God! How awesome!

348
00:41:09,686 --> 00:41:13,351
- Did somebody make this,
or was this already here?
- Quite a sight, huh?

349
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,351
- This is great!
- Holy shit! What in the wide
world ofsports is that thing?

350
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:21,316
That thing, gentlemen,
is gonna take us across this gorge.

351
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:24,526
- That's it?
- That's it.

352
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:29,411
- We'll die.
- Hey, relax, okay? I've been on
one ofthese things before.

353
00:41:29,498 --> 00:41:31,575
- Oh, yeah. Here we go.
- No, no, I tell you something--

354
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,704
- Yeah, tell me. Tell me.
- It's worse than it looks.
- Yeah, t-tell me, Big Ben.

355
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:38,046
- What is it that you haven't done?
A trip to Mars, maybe?
- Come on, Mac, please.

356
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:43,091
- Hey, I'm a fiîsherman.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please,
gentlemen, let's apply logic here.

357
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:47,012
- Let us simply ask ourselves
ifthis trip is genuinely necessary.
- Come on. Stop whining.

358
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,508
- What's the big deal? Let'sjust do it.
- There you go.

359
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:52,224
- Now you're talking my language, boy.
- You guys, wait a minute.
You don't have to do this.

360
00:41:52,314 --> 00:41:55,268
This is supposed to be a fun trip,
not hell night.

361
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,772
We can trek down the gorge
and go down river a couple miles.
Probably only set us back a day.

362
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:03,564
No. I'd rather die right now
than miss a day.

363
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:08,571
- He's right, I guess.
- Hold onto that real tight, will you?

364
00:42:08,665 --> 00:42:11,203
I'm gonna go across with one ofyou
and show you how to do it.

365
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:14,875
Then the others
come across in twos.

366
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:19,210
- So who's gonna take
the big plunge with me?
- Well, when you put it that way, l--
- I'll go.

367
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:22,545
Oh, real macho!

368
00:42:24,348 --> 00:42:27,799
- Yeah, I guess, uh--
I guess he goes, huh?
- Is that okay?

369
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:30,681
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, it's 'cause if
I don't go right away--
- Hey, fiîne.

370
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:32,811
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Yeah.

371
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:35,853
- Okay, what do we do now?
- Now we let gravity take over.

372
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:39,063
- Right.
- Let her rip!

373
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:41,990
My stomach!

374
00:42:46,204 --> 00:42:49,490
- Oh, I don't want to do this!
I wanna go--
-Just look at the boys.

375
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:52,703
You're all right.
Norm, look at the tree tops.

376
00:42:52,795 --> 00:42:54,871
- Isn't it pretty?
- I wanna go back. I wanna--
I don't wanna be here.

377
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:58,748
You're fiîne, see?
You're doing real good.

378
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:03,172
- Can you stop it?
- Sure, ifyou want.
- It would mean a lot.

379
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:06,384
- No, this is worse. This is worse!
- Pretty exciting, huh?

380
00:43:06,476 --> 00:43:10,604
- Yeah, so's a plane crash.
- Hey, Norman, I want you to do
something for me.

381
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:14,022
- What? What?
- I want you to turn around and take
a hold ofthis rope with both hands.

382
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:16,814
- What?
- I want you to start
pulling hand-over-hand.

383
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:20,319
- Uh-huh.
- And I want you to focus on that side.
- Okay.

384
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:22,447
- Okay?
- Okay.
- That's good.

385
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:24,657
- Like this? Like this?
- Norman, you don't
have to push yourself.

386
00:43:24,745 --> 00:43:29,288
- There's a rhythm to things out here.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It'sjust, uh--

387
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:32,660
- I'm just a little nervous.
- You're fiîne. You're doing fiîne.

388
00:43:34,755 --> 00:43:38,836
Well, we're almost there.
A little more. A little more.

389
00:43:38,926 --> 00:43:41,631
Oh, God. We're over land.
Thank God.

390
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,509
- There we go.
- Okay.

391
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:51,552
All right. Pull her in.
And then I want you to take hold
ofthe log there at the end.

392
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:53,641
- Okay.
- Good.

393
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:55,976
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna over to help the others.

394
00:43:56,070 --> 00:44:00,150
- When they come back, I want you
to give them a hand down, okay?
- Yeah. Sarah?

395
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:02,732
- Yeah?
- Your boyfriend.

396
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:06,990
How does he feel about you being out
here alone with the fiîve of us
like this, huh?

397
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:09,703
-Well, it's not really up to him, is it?
-Uh-huh.

398
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:12,793
I've always been pretty good
at taking care of myself.

399
00:44:46,122 --> 00:44:48,827
- What's the matter?
- What do you think's the matter? Look!

400
00:44:48,917 --> 00:44:51,871
That basket's supposed to be
in the middle and the rope's cut.

401
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:54,916
Take it easy. Anybody could have
doubled back and done that.

402
00:44:55,007 --> 00:44:58,625
- That doesn't mean anything's
happened to Sarah.
- Yeah.

403
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,088
- What are you doing?
- I'm going over to get the basket.

404
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:09,141
- Oh, shit!
- Get your pack off. Put your gloves on.

405
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:25,783
Take this rope
and feed me the slack.

406
00:45:25,873 --> 00:45:28,827
When I get in the basket,
pull us over. Got it?

407
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:31,243
Got it.

408
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:23,284
- Are you okay?
- No!

409
00:47:32,089 --> 00:47:36,751
- Try and reach the face!
- I'm trying!

410
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:08,542
Pull up!

411
00:48:23,143 --> 00:48:27,057
- Pull!
- Okay.

412
00:48:29,149 --> 00:48:31,142
Pull!

413
00:49:02,017 --> 00:49:04,508
Stantin!

414
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:13,692
God, what's he doing up there?

415
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,784
Okay, hold on!
Here we go.

416
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,207
You mountain men do
this kind ofshit a lot?

417
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:52,915
Every damn day.

418
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:55,251
Thanks.

419
00:50:58,932 --> 00:51:02,348
Hey, you all right?
That arm--

420
00:51:04,313 --> 00:51:06,804
- Let's push on.
- No.

421
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:10,897
No, you--
you need some more rest.

422
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:14,438
- No, I don't.
- I need some more rest.

423
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:27,241
I gotta hand it to you. It's good.

424
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:30,123
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's really good.

425
00:51:30,214 --> 00:51:33,797
It's not oysters on the halfshell,
but it--

426
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:35,711
- No.
- What?

427
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:39,219
I'm supposed to be meeting my girlfriend
right now at Donatello's.

428
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,972
- Three days.
- Three days?

429
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:45,137
To the nearest telephone.

430
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:49,645
I'm dead.

431
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:52,819
Ah, don't sweat it.
She'll understand.

432
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:55,775
Forget it. Over and out.

433
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:59,069
Let me cut you some more.
We got a long day tomorrow.

434
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:02,162
You'd better keep up your energy.

435
00:52:02,248 --> 00:52:07,373
Three days to a telephone.
How do you stand it out here?

436
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:11,874
You oughta try it sometime.
Might do you some good.

437
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,753
Couldn't do it.

438
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:17,051
I'm big city.

439
00:52:17,138 --> 00:52:19,214
Tell me something.

440
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:22,557
-What would you miss besides telephones?
-Everything.

441
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:27,522
Activity, action.

442
00:52:27,608 --> 00:52:29,850
Theatre and music.

443
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,069
Getting a good meal
at 4:00 in the morning.

444
00:52:35,157 --> 00:52:37,280
Everything.

445
00:52:38,995 --> 00:52:41,700
I don't suppose you've ever
eaten this before either, have you?

446
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:46,074
They serve rabbit
in lots of places.

447
00:52:46,169 --> 00:52:49,205
Yeah, maybe, but that ain't rabbit.

448
00:52:51,967 --> 00:52:54,422
- Then what the hell is it?
- Marmot.

449
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:59,389
Marmot? What's a marmot.

450
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:02,681
A rodent.

451
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:05,177
A rodent?

452
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,516
You mean, a rat?

453
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:11,859
Sort ofa big, hairy rat,
I guess. Yeah.

454
00:53:11,946 --> 00:53:14,105
Oh, shit.

455
00:53:14,198 --> 00:53:16,321
Hey, I know how you feel.

456
00:53:16,409 --> 00:53:18,983
Me, I think oysters taste like snot.

457
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,071
Oh, shit!

458
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:51,893
-Jesus! You frightened
the crap out of me!
- Shh!

459
00:53:51,988 --> 00:53:54,314
- I almost bashed
your brains in foryou!
- There's a bear.

460
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:57,527
- Shut up. I'm trying to sleep.
- Ben, I heard a bear.

461
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:02,531
- Harvey, wake up. Harvey, wake up.
- I heard it.Just-- Shh.

462
00:54:03,667 --> 00:54:06,538

- Steve. Steve.

463
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:08,621
Steve. Steve!

464
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,464

building a log cabin.
- Oh,Jesus.

465
00:54:15,555 --> 00:54:17,880
- Thought there was a bear or something.
- Scared the crap out of us.

466
00:54:17,974 --> 00:54:20,346
It was a big cabin.

467
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:22,842
- That's the noise.
- That's it. Give it to me.
- What?

468
00:54:22,937 --> 00:54:25,689
- Give it to me. Give me your knife.
- What's that? What's the matter?
- What noise?

469
00:54:25,774 --> 00:54:28,182
- Over there.
- Shh.
- What? Look. Look.
- Shit.

470
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:36,400
What, did you guys
think I was a bear?

471
00:54:36,493 --> 00:54:39,281
- Bear, my ass.
- Are you kidding?
- What bear?

472
00:54:39,371 --> 00:54:41,660
- Bear?
- Come on. We're not stupid.

473
00:54:41,749 --> 00:54:44,667
They always think I'm a bear.

483
00:55:16,327 --> 00:55:19,494
Okay, you guys, I want you to be real
careful in here. It gets kinda tricky.

484
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:23,993
Don't be embarrassed ifyou have to
hang onto tree branches or rocks, okay?

485
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:26,576
- Here's Mommy.

489
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:39,259
- Boy, I'm really starting
to like it up here.
- Yeah?

490
00:55:39,351 --> 00:55:44,310
I didn't think I would, you know.
I just came up here
to get away from my ex-wife.

491
00:55:44,398 --> 00:55:48,562
Actually, I'd like to have her
up here with me right now.

492
00:55:48,653 --> 00:55:52,152
One little shove would save me,
what, about 79 alimony cheques.

493
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,446
Yeah, I get it.

494
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:56,906
Oh! No, no, no, no! No, no--

495
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:09,421
Get your feet.
Don't look down. Don't look down!

496
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,968
- Norman, look at me.
- Help me, Steve.

497
00:56:13,054 --> 00:56:15,260
Okay, calm down.
I'm gonna help you.

498
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:17,803
Do what I tell you.
Catch your breath.

499
00:56:17,892 --> 00:56:19,968
Now, reach in that crack
and give me that gun.

500
00:56:20,061 --> 00:56:22,932
No-- What? Help me, goddam it.

Now, come on.
Good boy, good boy.

507
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,752
Grab my wrist.

508
00:56:47,757 --> 00:56:50,592
That's right.

509
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,638
Come on-- Oh. Good boy.
Come on. Come on.

510
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:59,258
All right, you got it.
You got it.

511
00:56:59,352 --> 00:57:02,472
All right, one more. Ready?

512
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:15,863
- What the hell happened?

Look out, look out. Don't move!

Hejust went over.

515
00:57:23,002 --> 00:57:24,580
- What?
- Norman?
- H-he slipped here, and he fell!

516
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:26,331
- Where?
- I don't know. Do you see him?

517
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:28,629
- My God!
- Get back from the edge.

518
00:57:34,848 --> 00:57:37,802
- Steve!

Jump.

520
00:57:55,495 --> 00:57:58,116
Jump!

521
00:57:58,206 --> 00:58:01,540
I'm sorry. I can't.

522
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:12,009
No!

523
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:15,097
Stop it. Stop it!
Take it easy! It's over!

524
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:22,805
Calm down, Sarah, calm down! It's over.

527
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:31,694

529
00:58:36,455 --> 00:58:39,539
There you go. Yeah, just forget

530
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:41,783
- Okay.
-Just forget this happened.

531
00:58:41,877 --> 00:58:43,704
-Just go on like before.

- God, Sarah, I've been trying--

539
00:59:17,248 --> 00:59:20,913
-I didn't try anything.
-Thought you might be thinking about it.

540
00:59:22,753 --> 00:59:26,917
Listen, uh, Sarah, there's a storm.
One hell ofa storm.

541
00:59:27,008 --> 00:59:28,882
It's here now,

Don't do that.

00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,238
He wouldn't be upset about a storm.
Ask him what's wrong.

549
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:51,232
What's wrong?

550
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:54,196

Okay.

552
00:59:55,913 --> 00:59:59,247
This is a very serious storm

00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:01,659
At least five inches ofsnow.

554
01:00:01,753 --> 01:00:05,502
- Tell him you're alone so we can talk.
- I'm alone.

555
01:00:08,218 --> 01:00:12,512

01:00:26,696 --> 01:00:29,068
He's leading Stantin,

564

565
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:42,997

01:00:48,427 --> 01:00:53,635
- Well, was she under duress?
- Well, she sounded kinda strange.
I'm not sure.

568
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:59,891
So, who'sJonathan?

569
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:08,361
Is that your boyfriend, Sarah?

570
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:10,939
Is that your boyfriend?

571
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,779
Yeah, it's your boyfriend.

572
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,333
Don't move.

573
01:01:24,382 --> 01:01:26,624
There.

574
01:03:14,831 --> 01:03:17,583
Sarah!

575
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,541
She's dead.

576
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,210
- Washed down the river.
- No.

577
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,513
If he knew the mountains,
he would've gone alone.

578
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,471
He doesn't, so he needs a guide.

579
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:39,227
Come on. She's still alive,
and we've got to help her.

580
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:03,874
Knox.

581
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:13,181
Hey, this is Sarah's handwriting.

582
01:04:26,073 --> 01:04:28,362
What the hell does this mean,
"You ought know me by now"?

583
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:32,662
- Take it easy, Knox.Just take it easy.
- What did this guy do?

584
01:04:32,747 --> 01:04:36,827
- You said it was extortion and murder.
- It was. How do you light this?

585
01:04:36,918 --> 01:04:39,326
That wasn't all it was, was it?

586
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:41,378
No, it wasn't.

587
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,717
Well?

588
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:48,839
He had a hostage in San Francisco.

589
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:51,801
A diamond merchant's wife.
He killed her...

590
01:04:51,892 --> 01:04:54,561
after he got the diamonds...

591
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:57,218
just to make a point.

592
01:04:57,314 --> 01:05:01,443
- What point?
- That I shouldn't have interfered.

593
01:05:12,747 --> 01:05:17,789
You botched it up,
so now you want revenge,
and she's gonna get killed for it.

594
01:05:19,212 --> 01:05:21,834
You listen to me.
That note is right.

595
01:05:21,924 --> 01:05:24,462
I am getting to know this guy.

596
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:29,048
He'll only kill a hostage
he has no use for. Understand me?

597
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:34,134
So long as you and I stay tight
on his ass, Sarah will stay alive.

598
01:05:34,228 --> 01:05:39,021
Now, let's get some rest.
We'll catch up with him tomorrow.

599
01:05:39,108 --> 01:05:41,564
Go get your pack.

600
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:17,688
They already got a hell ofa head start.
Now there's only two ofthem,
they'll move faster.

601
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:19,399
Then we'll move faster.

602
01:06:19,484 --> 01:06:21,560
In two or three days
they'll be at the border.

603
01:06:21,653 --> 01:06:25,153
You said yourselfthat he'll kill her
as soon as he doesn't need her.

604
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,696
That means I gotta get to them
before they get to Canada.

605
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:31,320
- We'll get them
before they get to Canada.
- Wait a minute, Stantin.

606
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:35,494
You're already exhausted.
It's cold, and it's gonna get colder.

607
01:06:35,585 --> 01:06:37,957
There's a storm moving in.
Understand?

608
01:06:38,046 --> 01:06:40,334
I'm not afraid ofa storm.

609
01:06:40,423 --> 01:06:42,748
You dumb bastard.
You could die up there.

610
01:06:42,842 --> 01:06:46,377
And if not that, you'd slow me down
so much that Sarah'd get killed.

611
01:06:46,471 --> 01:06:50,054
So you got one choice,
and that's to stay here.

612
01:06:50,142 --> 01:06:54,638
You go with me,
oryou don't go at all.

613
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:58,348
Bullshit.
You're not gonna shoot me.

614
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:11,365
You ever killed a man?
You ever break up a bank robbery?

615
01:07:11,456 --> 01:07:15,785
I'm 22 years in the FBl, Knox.

616
01:07:15,877 --> 01:07:21,168
I've come up against the Mafiîa,
the Ku Klux Klan...

617
01:07:21,258 --> 01:07:23,665
the KGB.

618
01:07:25,512 --> 01:07:29,806
Understand me.
I'm qualifiîed to go after this guy.

619
01:07:29,892 --> 01:07:32,928
You thinkyou are, but you're not.

620
01:07:50,497 --> 01:07:54,246
All right.
All right, I'll take you.

621
01:07:54,334 --> 01:07:58,202
But you'd better keep up, because ifyou
slow me down and Sarah gets killed...

622
01:07:58,297 --> 01:08:00,503
I'll kill you.

623
01:08:04,762 --> 01:08:08,096
Sarah, slow down.

624
01:08:08,182 --> 01:08:11,433
Stop! Sarah, wait.

625
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:13,311
Wait!

626
01:08:27,453 --> 01:08:32,411
For the last houryou've been getting
farther and farther ahead.

627
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,624
What's the matter, Sarah?

628
01:08:48,933 --> 01:08:51,222
You're crazy.

629
01:09:08,621 --> 01:09:10,993
See that?

630
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:15,745
I'm not crazy.

631
01:09:15,837 --> 01:09:19,704
You get me across the border,
I'll give this to you.

632
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:26,889
You understand me?
I'm giving you this.

633
01:09:26,974 --> 01:09:30,841
But you pull any ofthat shit again,
and I'll kill you.

634
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:08,850
Your name. Say your name.

635
01:10:08,934 --> 01:10:11,260
Warren Stantin.

636
01:10:12,647 --> 01:10:18,068
Every time you lose your wind,
you stop and say your name. Got that?

637
01:10:18,153 --> 01:10:22,898
What if I'm too tired
to remember my name?

638
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:25,316
For ten bucks, I'll remind you.

639
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,617
Okay. Okay.

640
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:55,265
Should've stayed in that cabin
while you had the chance.

641
01:10:55,358 --> 01:10:59,143
I have to go up the rock face,
then up through a chimney to the top.

642
01:10:59,237 --> 01:11:01,693
That'll save at least a day.

643
01:11:01,782 --> 01:11:04,985
They'll keep to the valleys
to avoid the storm that's coming in.

644
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:08,031
I gotta go over the mountain
and right through the storm.

645
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:14,875
So when it gets dark get in your bag,
get under my poncho, say your prayers.

646
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:16,836
You'll be okay.

647
01:11:16,923 --> 01:11:20,672
When I get to the border,
I'll send some guys foryou.

648
01:12:36,507 --> 01:12:38,464
Oh,Jesus.

649
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:02,532
You stubborn son ofa bitch.
Can't you listen to common sense?

650
01:13:06,789 --> 01:13:10,122
Tie my rope around your waist,
and I'll loweryou down.

651
01:13:14,547 --> 01:13:16,753
What are you-- Oh! What are you
trying to do, kill yourself?

652
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:20,708
- Tie it around your waist.
I'll loweryou down.
- No.

653
01:13:20,803 --> 01:13:23,425
- I'm coming up.
- You're crazy.

654
01:13:23,515 --> 01:13:25,341
I'm coming up.

655
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:28,553
Fine. Go ahead.

656
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:37,643
- I can't!
- Good. Now, are you gonna tie on?

657
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:42,400
- Are you gonna lower me down?
- Yes.

658
01:13:42,493 --> 01:13:46,277
- No.
- Oh, to hell with you, then.
I'm going to Canada.

659
01:13:51,502 --> 01:13:53,828
Knox?

660
01:13:57,676 --> 01:13:59,917
Knox!

661
01:14:05,517 --> 01:14:08,637
Change your mind
about going back down, Stantin?

662
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:11,600
No. I want to go up.

663
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:15,024
All right, you pig-headed bastard.
I can't argue with you all day.

664
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:19,025
- Tie it around your waist
and I'll bring you up.
- How do I know you're not
gonna lower me down?

665
01:14:19,115 --> 01:14:23,195
Because I said so, you son ofa bitch!
Now, tie on while I'm still
in a good mood!

666
01:14:29,417 --> 01:14:32,205
Jesus.

667
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,506
Ready.

668
01:14:41,597 --> 01:14:44,551
Well, you gotta climb too.

669
01:14:44,642 --> 01:14:47,512
I'm not gonna do all the work.

670
01:14:47,603 --> 01:14:50,355
All right, you push up while I pull.

671
01:14:58,907 --> 01:15:01,196
Come here and light this.

672
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,358
All right.

673
01:15:35,946 --> 01:15:38,519
Hey, what's all this smoke?
You sending a signal or something?

674
01:15:38,615 --> 01:15:40,608
The wood's wet.
It's gonna smoke.

675
01:15:40,701 --> 01:15:44,366
Yeah? We're not gonna have
any fucking fiîre. How about that?

676
01:15:45,623 --> 01:15:48,624
I'm sick ofthis.

677
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:52,328
You don't want a fiîre, fiîne.
We'll have sushi.

678
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:00,963
You want some?

679
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:05,512
Hey!Jesus!

680
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:34,923
My leg. It's cramped! A cramp!

681
01:16:37,803 --> 01:16:39,961
Lay back!

682
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:48,388
Better?

683
01:16:48,481 --> 01:16:50,888
Yeah. Yeah.

684
01:16:52,443 --> 01:16:57,236
You're soaking wet. When it
starts to freeze, you're fiînished.

685
01:16:57,323 --> 01:16:59,399
Get your pack off!

686
01:17:00,743 --> 01:17:03,151
Find something to dig with.

687
01:17:14,007 --> 01:17:16,415
Dig, Stantin, dig!

688
01:17:29,524 --> 01:17:32,975
Start digging, or we're both gonna die!

689
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:19,357
Oh, God, you've gotta get out ofthese.
Your belly's ice cold.

690
01:18:26,584 --> 01:18:28,375
Get up.

691
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:43,431
What-- What's your problem?

692
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:45,891
You heard about us country boys,
haven't you?

693
01:18:48,148 --> 01:18:50,556
Jesus, you smell.

694
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:56,231
- Do I smell like that?
- Well--

695
01:19:54,718 --> 01:19:57,126
Oh, yeah. Weather looks better.

696
01:19:57,221 --> 01:20:00,258
I think we should be able
to make up some time.

697
01:20:00,349 --> 01:20:04,015
- Thanks for helping me.
- Ah, don't mention it.

698
01:20:04,103 --> 01:20:06,595
How do you feel?

699
01:20:06,689 --> 01:20:09,097
How do I look?

700
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:14,269
My great-granddaddy
was 87 when he died...

701
01:20:14,364 --> 01:20:17,282
and I'll always remember
seeing him in his coffiîn.

702
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:19,609
So?

703
01:20:19,703 --> 01:20:24,496
Well, he looked a damn sight healthier
three days dead than you do now.

704
01:21:21,101 --> 01:21:22,893
Jesus Christ!

705
01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:31,517
What do we do?

706
01:21:31,612 --> 01:21:34,448
Don't move.

707
01:21:34,532 --> 01:21:38,197
I know that.

708
01:21:38,286 --> 01:21:40,658
You're the mountain man.
How do we make it go away?

709
01:21:40,747 --> 01:21:42,870
You can't.

710
01:21:44,751 --> 01:21:47,705
- Maybe we oughta throw it some food.
- We are the food.

711
01:21:50,674 --> 01:21:55,004
- Why don't you shoot it?
- Uh, that'll only piss him off.

712
01:21:56,305 --> 01:22:00,089
Let's backtrack.
But be real casual.

713
01:22:00,184 --> 01:22:02,426
Uh-huh.

714
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,347
Casual.

715
01:22:15,867 --> 01:22:18,405
Shit!

716
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:14,047
I've never-- I've never seen a grizzly
turn and run like that before.

717
01:23:14,137 --> 01:23:16,130
Well...

718
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:20,890
everybody else around here acts like
they've never seen a black man before.

719
01:23:20,978 --> 01:23:24,144
Why should a bear be different, eh?

720
01:23:44,878 --> 01:23:46,870
Which way, Sarah?

721
01:23:49,216 --> 01:23:51,208
Which way, Sarah?

722
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:13,566
I can smell it.
We're right behind 'em.

723
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,081
Ow! Damn! Ow!

724
01:24:27,172 --> 01:24:29,331
- What happened?
- I don't know. It's my leg.

725
01:24:37,141 --> 01:24:38,683
Stop!

726
01:24:52,657 --> 01:24:55,824
Please help me!

727
01:25:27,194 --> 01:25:30,859
- Sarah!
- Get back.

728
01:25:39,123 --> 01:25:41,365
You make a move and I kill him.

729
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:44,370
Hey! Hey, stop!

730
01:25:46,214 --> 01:25:48,420
Stop! Stop, okay?

731
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:52,752
Okay. Good, good, good, good, good.
Come on. Come on.

732
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:54,637
No!

733
01:25:55,766 --> 01:25:58,435
Thanks a lot.

734
01:26:02,856 --> 01:26:04,648
No!

735
01:26:06,444 --> 01:26:08,686
Stop!

736
01:26:35,015 --> 01:26:37,767
Well, halfof my refrigerator is gone.
I haven't checked the rest ofthe house.

737
01:26:37,852 --> 01:26:41,980
- There could be things missing,
for all I know.
- I'm sorry. We're right in the middle
ofa very big manhunt here.

738
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:43,974
- I can't get anyone up there.
-Jack, I know what you're thinking.

739
01:26:44,067 --> 01:26:47,981
This is not the same thing as them
painting graffiîti on the side ofthe
wall or-or digging up the flower beds.

740
01:26:48,071 --> 01:26:51,689
- No, I understand--
- I mean, when they actually break into
the house, then I'm sorry, I can't--

741
01:26:51,783 --> 01:26:54,570
I should've ditched you in the woods.

742
01:26:54,661 --> 01:26:57,698
I should've let you freeze
up there in that snow.

743
01:26:57,789 --> 01:27:00,790
I could've left you hanging
on that rock face. You know that.

744
01:27:03,379 --> 01:27:06,499
Aw, Christ.

745
01:27:06,590 --> 01:27:09,544
Gentlemen, we have two new reports.

746
01:27:09,635 --> 01:27:11,924
A motorcycle was stolen
from behind the high school...

747
01:27:12,013 --> 01:27:15,097
and $300 is missing from the till
at the Crown Market.

748
01:27:15,183 --> 01:27:18,718
Now, I know it doesn't sound like much,
but you never know.

749
01:27:18,812 --> 01:27:22,430
- Uh, we're about to
go check out the market.
- Mildred, we're very, very busy here.

750
01:27:22,524 --> 01:27:26,308
They broke into my house.
The kitchen is an absolute pigsty.

751
01:27:26,403 --> 01:27:30,104
I'll get someone up there as soon
as I can. I promise. Okay? Thankyou.

752
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:34,908
Excuse me, ma'am.
Exactly what happened in your kitchen?

753
01:27:38,207 --> 01:27:42,419
Inspector, could you check to see if
there were any long-distance phone calls
made from this number?

754
01:27:44,672 --> 01:27:47,080
I don't think they were teenagers.

755
01:27:47,175 --> 01:27:50,793
What teenagers are going to drink
just milk and Cokes...

756
01:27:50,887 --> 01:27:53,841
when there's also beer
in the refrigerator?

757
01:27:56,643 --> 01:27:59,893
On that side, the table and the utensils
have been wiped clean.

758
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,305
Over here, prints everywhere.

759
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:04,522
Why?

760
01:28:11,951 --> 01:28:16,079
The suspect brought Sarah here.
Rope fiîbres.

761
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:20,660
He tied her to the leg ofthis table,
sat over there where you are...

762
01:28:20,752 --> 01:28:22,163
and ate.

763
01:28:23,588 --> 01:28:27,253
There was a call.
Vancouver number. 926-0484.

764
01:28:27,342 --> 01:28:29,216
Bingo.

765
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:48,605
Mr Stantin.

766
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:51,023
Superintendent Hsu.
I hope my men have taken care ofyou.

767
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:55,779
They've been wonderful.
I'd just about forgotten
how good a hot shower feels.

768
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:57,414
- Hey, how you doin', man?
- Good.
- This is MrJonathan Knox.

769
01:28:57,499 --> 01:29:00,370
- Mr Knox.
- Thanks for the clothes.

770
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,667
- Promise you'll burn these.
- You bet.

771
01:29:04,006 --> 01:29:06,579
Wejust fiînished interrogating the man
the phone call was placed to.

772
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:10,887
His name is Fournier. He lives
out in the British properties.

773
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:13,427
Very expensive neighbourhood.

774
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:15,722
He's a diamond broker.

775
01:29:17,061 --> 01:29:19,303
- How you been?
- You're saying he's a fence.
- What's up?

776
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:22,517
We've never been able to prove anything.
He claims the call was a wrong number.

777
01:29:22,609 --> 01:29:24,648
Phone company said the call
lasted 1 9 minutes.

778
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:28,152
Yeah, we know he's lying.
Here's Fournier now.

779
01:29:29,908 --> 01:29:34,286
Superintendent, I'm so concerned
about that poor girl being held hostage.

780
01:29:34,371 --> 01:29:39,958
I'm very sorry I can't help you,
but I would like to know
how everything turns out.

781
01:29:40,044 --> 01:29:42,083
Isn't that a fiîne man?

782
01:29:42,171 --> 01:29:46,798
He and I havejust been to see
your boss, lnspector Hsu,
and I think we made our point...

783
01:29:46,884 --> 01:29:50,882
which is that ifyou ever bring
my client down here on this kind
ofchickenshit questioning again...

784
01:29:50,972 --> 01:29:53,463
I'll sue the whole fucking department.

785
01:29:53,558 --> 01:29:57,141
Understand? Make sense to you?
Uphold the law and all that?

786
01:29:59,272 --> 01:30:03,104
- Why the hell are you letting him walk?
- We have nothing on him.
No grounds for charges.

787
01:30:03,193 --> 01:30:05,863
- We'll keep him under surveillance.
- I'm sure your men
will come up with something.

788
01:30:05,946 --> 01:30:08,354
We appreciate everything, lnspector.

789
01:30:10,242 --> 01:30:13,908
- You'rejust gonna let him
offthe hook, aren't you?
- Look, the police are doing
everything they can.

790
01:30:13,996 --> 01:30:15,870
- Oh, Stantin!
- Look, mister.

791
01:30:15,957 --> 01:30:19,326
You may be some hot-shit guy
back on your turf, but you're in
my territory now...

792
01:30:19,419 --> 01:30:24,330
so sit back and enjoy the ride.

793
01:31:01,213 --> 01:31:04,048
What-- Hey! Hey, hey!

794
01:31:04,132 --> 01:31:07,964
Hey! What the-- Get your hands
offof me! What is this?

795
01:31:08,053 --> 01:31:10,378
- Shut up!
-Jesus.

796
01:31:10,472 --> 01:31:12,216
- Do you know who I am?
- Shut up!

797
01:31:12,308 --> 01:31:18,311
- I could pick up the phone
and have you killed. Fuckyou!
- Did you hear that?
He could have us killed.

798
01:31:18,397 --> 01:31:21,268
What is it, money you want?
Huh? You want money?

799
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:24,230
I'll open the safe,
I'll give you all the money you want.

800
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,894
Good, good.

801
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:29,742
- Set?
- Set. Two minutes.

802
01:31:33,538 --> 01:31:35,780
What's that noise?

803
01:31:35,874 --> 01:31:39,160
What's happening? Huh?

804
01:31:39,253 --> 01:31:42,170
What's happening?
Talk to me, goddam it! Talk to me!

805
01:31:42,256 --> 01:31:44,628
Let's rip some ofthe stuffiîng
out ofthe couches.

806
01:31:44,717 --> 01:31:48,715
Oh,Jesus, what, are you
gonna burn down my house?

807
01:31:48,804 --> 01:31:52,672
Look, we can make a deal, huh?
Can't we make a deal, for Christ's sake?

808
01:31:52,767 --> 01:31:55,602
You're already dead.
Dead men don't make deals.

809
01:31:55,687 --> 01:31:59,305
- What did he do, anyway?
- He stole two pounds ofdiamonds
from the wrong people.

810
01:31:59,399 --> 01:32:03,349
- No. No. I didn't steal them.
- Okay, we'll torch these, and the
whole city'll come down on top of him.

811
01:32:03,445 --> 01:32:05,603
I didn't steal them!
I don't have them!

812
01:32:05,697 --> 01:32:09,647
Look, all I was doing
was brokering them. I-l don't
even know where they came from!

813
01:32:09,743 --> 01:32:13,408
- They could trace that tape.
- Nah. It'll burn right along with him
and the rest of his--

814
01:32:13,497 --> 01:32:19,287
You can get the diamonds back.
The guy who stole them
is meeting me tomorrow.

815
01:32:19,378 --> 01:32:22,415
Robson Square, noon,
at the skating rink.

816
01:32:22,507 --> 01:32:24,962
- Okay, okay, 30 seconds. Let's go!
- Okay.

817
01:32:25,051 --> 01:32:27,340
He's the one you want! Not me!

818
01:32:27,428 --> 01:32:31,094
You can have the diamonds back!
Just turn offthe timer!

819
01:32:34,853 --> 01:32:37,178
Diamonds, Mr Fournier?

820
01:32:38,857 --> 01:32:44,943
- What are you doing here?
- We received a phone call.
They said there was a break-in.

821
01:34:06,449 --> 01:34:09,285
H-Hey! He's got my purse!

822
01:34:09,369 --> 01:34:11,825
- Hey, come on, buddy!
- Someone stop him! He's got my purse!

823
01:34:11,914 --> 01:34:15,413
Somebody stop him, please!

824
01:34:15,501 --> 01:34:17,577
You bum!

825
01:34:52,707 --> 01:34:56,242
Fuck. Shit.

826
01:35:08,723 --> 01:35:11,511
- Go!
- Go, go, go!

827
01:35:15,355 --> 01:35:18,060
- This way!
- No!

828
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:20,724
- Come here!
- Let go of me!

829
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:23,524
- Get up! Get up!
- You motherfucker!

830
01:35:23,614 --> 01:35:26,022
- Sarah!
-Jonathan!

831
01:35:30,955 --> 01:35:33,743
Go! Get! Get! Go!

832
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:36,503
- Get out ofthe car!
Get out ofthe car! Come on!
- What are you doing?

833
01:35:36,586 --> 01:35:38,911
Get in here! Come on!

834
01:35:41,633 --> 01:35:45,298
- He took my truck!
- Everybody down!

835
01:35:45,387 --> 01:35:49,255
- On the side! Let's move, move, move!
- Open the door!

836
01:36:20,466 --> 01:36:22,090
Watch out!

837
01:36:40,695 --> 01:36:43,021
You're crazy!

838
01:37:08,016 --> 01:37:09,890
Stantin!

839
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:00,727
Okay, what do we got?

840
01:38:02,365 --> 01:38:04,404
- See the car?
- No.

841
01:38:04,492 --> 01:38:06,366
- Yes! There he is!
- On the ferry!

842
01:38:06,452 --> 01:38:09,288
- On the left-hand ferry!
- Go, go!
- Okay!

843
01:38:09,372 --> 01:38:12,824
Wait till you get a good shot.
He's still got a hostage.

844
01:38:12,918 --> 01:38:15,290
- All right, there's gonna be a lot
of people up there, so watch your fiîre.
- Go!

845
01:38:15,378 --> 01:38:17,834
Stay calm!

846
01:38:17,923 --> 01:38:20,877
- Let's check the wheel house.
- The wagon, the wagon.

847
01:38:24,430 --> 01:38:26,885
On the upper deck!

848
01:38:29,143 --> 01:38:31,017
- Knox.
- What?

849
01:38:32,438 --> 01:38:35,273
He's on that one.

850
01:38:36,651 --> 01:38:39,320
Why do you think that?

851
01:38:39,404 --> 01:38:42,440
- That's the kind of move
this bastard would make.
- Stay back.

852
01:38:52,668 --> 01:38:56,084
- Hey!
- Hey, you can't go on there! Hold it!

853
01:39:09,477 --> 01:39:12,348
- Where do we start?
- Right here.

854
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:15,896
You take the right side,
I'll take the left.

855
01:40:17,924 --> 01:40:20,380
Sarah! Get down!

856
01:40:27,643 --> 01:40:29,719
Get up!

857
01:40:31,731 --> 01:40:34,482
Come on! Don't fiîght me!

858
01:40:38,446 --> 01:40:41,945
Come on!

859
01:40:42,033 --> 01:40:43,860
Jonathan!

860
01:41:03,848 --> 01:41:05,840
Hold it!

861
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:12,308
- Let the girl go.
- Fuckyou.

862
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:18,317
Come on, Stantin.
We've both been here before.

863
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:22,485
You tried to play games last time,
got a woman killed. Remember?

864
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:27,867
This time you do exactly what I say,
or I'm gonna have to kill another one.

865
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:32,500
- Now, go over the side.
- You shoot her,
you're dead halfa second later.

866
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:38,003
- Stantin, I'm serious.
- So am l.

867
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,630
You want to die, go ahead and shoot.

868
01:41:42,305 --> 01:41:45,223
- I'll do it!
- Let her go or die.

869
01:41:45,308 --> 01:41:47,799
That's the only deal you're gonna make.

870
01:41:58,030 --> 01:42:00,486
I'll kill her, Stantin!
Goddam it, I'll kill her!

871
01:42:05,454 --> 01:42:08,076
Oh, my God!

872
01:42:11,753 --> 01:42:15,252
Get out of my way! Move!

873
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:18,009
Get out of my way!

874
01:42:27,269 --> 01:42:29,974
Out of my way!

875
01:42:31,482 --> 01:42:33,807
Move! Move!

876
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:39,902
Go on, move! Move!
Go on! Down! One side!

877
01:42:41,909 --> 01:42:44,317
Get down! Get down!

878
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:32,538
- Hey, come on over here. Come here.
- No. No. No.

879
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:35,547
Come here. Come on. Come on.

880
01:43:35,633 --> 01:43:39,844
Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
