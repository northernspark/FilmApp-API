{3088}{3158}[Man] The time has come|to go to war again.
{3160}{3253}Not with Iraq, international terrorists,|or what was once Yugoslavia...
{3255}{3301}but with the medfly...
{3303}{3370}a potentially devastating insect...
{3373}{3455}that has chosen to make California|its new home.
{3458}{3582}Despite assurances that spraying poses|no significant health risks to the public...
{3585}{3648}the public is not convinced.
{3650}{3722}People sense they're being|kept in the dark purposely.
{3724}{3794}Furthermore, there is no consensus...
{3796}{3857}as to whether the objectives|are even realistic.
{3882}{3942}[Commentator Continues]|Is this a war that can be won?
{3945}{3990}Some say no.

{4468}{4526}- Do you have to wear your glasses on TV?|- Like smart bombs...
{4528}{4591}- Shh.|- That destroy one thing, but nothing else.
{4594}{4681}The bait attracts the hungry,|newly hatched medflies...

{80045}{80169}Let's take the kids, put them in the car,|drive around and see if anybody's seen him.
{80171}{80233}- Can't do it. I got plans.|- Oh, Gene, come on!
{80236}{80293}Sherri, I told you|a week and a half ago...
{80296}{80391}I got the leadership... council thing|on the... crack kids.
{80447}{80517}What you should do is,|you should go out with the kids...
{80519}{80581}put up some signs, offer a reward -|not too much.
{80584}{80643}- Remember, it's a dog.|- Who's Claire "The Clown" Kane?
{80675}{80733}What are you doing|looking in my pockets?
{80735}{80803}What are you doing with|her driver's license and telephone number?
{80849}{80910}You wanna know?|I'll tell you.
{80913}{80983}Claire Kane, a.k.a. "The Clown"...
{81010}{81077}is a bunco artist|wanted in three states.
{81080}{81181}I have her phone number because I'm|running a sting operation. Now you know.
{81183}{81240}And now, unfortunately...
{81242}{81338}I have compromised your safety|and the children's safety.
{81341}{81388}Are you happy now?
{81558}{81626}[Marian] There is a-|a hard, heavy physicality...
{81629}{81674}in my new paintings...
{81677}{81767}in part because I've executed them|on large panels of wood...
{81770}{81825}but I'd say that|they're tempered by the-
{81827}{81886}- Oh. Sorry.|- Sorry.
{81889}{81951}Um, tempered by|the ephemeral use of color.
{81954}{82005}You could almost say|that it's beyond natural color.
{82008}{82061}[Man On Phone]|What are they about?
{82064}{82151}[Marian] Well... [Sighs]|I think they're about seeing...
{82154}{82223}and the responsibility|that comes with that.
{82226}{82290}- Okay.|- [Man] And call next week.
{82293}{82370}- Thanks. Thank you very much.|- Bye.
{82373}{82430}Bye-bye.
{82433}{82492}Who was that? Sherri?
{82494}{82549}No, that was David...
{82551}{82612}at the gallery.
{82615}{82661}Oh. David at the gallery.
{82663}{82718}I'm hoping to get a show there.
{82721}{82810}Is this "David at the gallery" going to be|another Mitchell Anderson in our lives?
{82837}{82877}What's that supposed to mean?
{82880}{82957}Well, that's the sort of stuff you two|used to blather on about, isn't it?
{82959}{83008}What are you talking about?
{83011}{83113}The lousy painter. The one who never|sold anything. Mitchell Anderson.
{83179}{83252}Just because he never sold anything|doesn't mean he was a lousy painter.
{83255}{83298}So you've said.
{83301}{83355}Well, it's true.
{83358}{83411}You know,|scientifically speaking, Marian...
{83414}{83485}there's no such thing|as "beyond natural color. '"
{83488}{83557}[Stuart] I don't know why we're sittin'|around here actin'like it was our fault.
{83560}{83617}We didn't have|anything to do with it.
{83620}{83675}[Gordon] Yeah. Suppose we'd never|come up here in the first place.
{83678}{83778}When would she have been found?|Maybe never. Nothing we can do to help.
{83781}{83874}[Vern] She must have been murdered.|I mean, she's naked and everything.
{83877}{83958}[Gordon] Nothing we're gonna|do about it tonight, anyway.
{83961}{84006}[Stuart]|Suppose it floats away.
{84009}{84054}[Vern]|Then it's out of our hands.
{84057}{84138}Maybe that's what we oughta do -|kick it loose and let somebody else find it.
{84141}{84243}[Stuart] Ah, I don't know. I think we|oughta tie it up so it won't float away.
{84246}{84327}Then we can, uh, you know,|deal with it in the morning.
{84330}{84375}What do you say about that?
{84378}{84459}[Vern] I say we got two hours of prime trout|time left. That's what we oughta deal with.
{84462}{84531}[Gordon]|Hey, let's take a vote.
{84534}{84579}[Stuart]|All right by me.
{84582}{84651}Fish now,|or deal with the body.
{84654}{84699}I say fish now.

{85412}{85466}Chad, you know what?
{85469}{85543}I think that it was really nice|that Gene brought us here tonight...
{85546}{85590}and I think we should say|thank you.
