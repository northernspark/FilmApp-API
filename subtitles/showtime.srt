{1140}{1215}Being a policeman|is not what you see on TV.
{1220}{1297}I've never had to pick between|the red and blue wires.
{1302}{1426}Never seen a police car flip and cause|other cars to burst into flames.
{1431}{1553}Never had to jump across rooftops.|I investigate crimes, track leads...
{1558}{1695}...and sit in court. It's difficult,|tedious work, and you won't get rich.
{1700}{1771}But I've done it for 28 years.
{1776}{1882}I'm a detective. That's what I do.|If you break the law...
{1887}{1985}...l'll do all I can to hunt you down|and put you behind bars.
{2024}{2091}I won't say that I succeed every time.
{2096}{2195}But I try to make sure that|if you do the crime, you'll do time.
{2200}{2236}Any questions?
{2350}{2453}Well, Detective Preston,|why don't you tell us about...
{2458}{2516}...the lighter side of police work?
{2540}{2596}You know. The fun days.
{2641}{2719}I chased him over three roofs.|You can't do this!
{2724}{2793}It's from the mayor.|You're a loose cannon.
{2798}{2867}-You destroyed a city block!|-He fired first.
{2872}{2904}I should read him his rights?
{2909}{3061}-You should've called for backup.|-My only backup is in a hospital bed!
{3145}{3261}His doctor called five minutes ago.|Jimmy didn't make it.
{3298}{3322}Oh, God.
{3460}{3497}Oh, God, no.
{3524}{3563}No!
{3601}{3674}-He was talking about getting out.|-lt's hard.
{3680}{3759}He was like a brother to me, captain.
{3764}{3856}Since we was kids, we was partners.|We used to hang out...
{3861}{3947}...and dream about|being on the force together.
{3952}{4028}That was the dream.|Just two little Irish boys...
{4033}{4127}...fighting, scrapping,|thinking about making a difference.
{4132}{4181}God, I'm gonna miss him!
{4251}{4329}I'll need your gun|and your shield, Pete.
{4501}{4592}I may be off the force,|but I am not off this case!
{4606}{4718}-That's not in the script.|-I just threw that in at the end.
{4723}{4824}-I thought I should get the last line.|-Nailed it!
{4852}{4912}Trey, it was great. Very believable.
{4917}{5003}-But I'm not married to it.|-You can't fix perfect.
{5008}{5048}We have imaginations.
{5056}{5098}Thanks. We'll call you.
{5103}{5159}-You got my number.|-Right here.
{5164}{5220}-Moved to tears. Bye-bye.|-Take care.
{5224}{5273}-You too.|-Restroom on the left.
{5280}{5362}-Don't give up the day job.|-Unless it's acting.
{5489}{5548}1L 43, clear from code 7.
{5552}{5639}{y:i}Roger, 1L 43.|{y:i}Hope you had a nice lunch.
{6923}{6987}Getting ready to break my old score.
{7199}{7246}Gonna break my old record!
{7376}{7431}Now I get my grades in kills.
{7528}{7592}Just broke it!|I got the top 10 spots now!
{7597}{7728}-Anybody want to take on the Ice Trey?|-Way to lay down the law, Top Cop.
{8793}{8853}-How you doing?|-What's up?
{8882}{9027}-Mitchie Mitch! How's it going, man?|-This is a friend of mine. Rich guy.
{9032}{9121}-How you doing?|-I'm all right.
{9288}{9432}Requesting assistance, possible 211 at|the TV repair shop on 1st and Santee.
{9452}{9506}{y:i}Maxis Network Channel 3 chopper.
{9511}{9643}{y:i}We got a hit on the police scanner.|{y:i}Something going down at 1st and Santee.
{9686}{9756}{y:i}This is Maxis Mobile One.|{y:i}We're on our way.
{9768}{9832}A quick left, quick right.
{9865}{9905}All day.
{9932}{10033}-We got a couple of big spenders.|-Don't get up for us.
{10309}{10368}You all want to do something?
{10372}{10482}Yeah, we were wondering|if maybe you'd throw in a free set.
{10487}{10557}Two free sets.|One for him, one for me.
{10709}{10746}What's in the bag?
{10770}{10813}-Let's do it.|-All right.
{11388}{11424}It's all here.
{11429}{11469}-All good?|-Good to go.
{11477}{11539}Good. So you show us yours.
{11616}{11659}Don't look, now.
{11749}{11774}Touchdown.
{11932}{12032}-Check the metal detector's batteries.|-How about that, Re?
{12568}{12596}Thirsty?
{12625}{12657}A lifesaver.
{12693}{12771}That's some pretty high-quality shit.
{12776}{12843}All right. So we're on, right?
{12996}{13044}What the hell is this?
{13055}{13134}-What the hell is going on?|-Wait. Hold on.
{13139}{13203}-This some police shit?|-What?
{13208}{13331}-You brought the police back here?|-Take it easy!
{13336}{13427}-Don't tell me to take it easy!|-Don't tell me to shut up.
{13432}{13504}You better calm your punk ass down!
{13509}{13563}Stop pointing that shit at me!
{13600}{13667}-Put that away.|-You think it's a game?
{13716}{13754}Put the gun away.
{13768}{13849}See, it's gone.|It's all over. Let's go. Come on.
{13977}{14054}Let's wrap it up.|I don't want them coming back.
{14059}{14088}All right.
{14161}{14205}What the hell is going on?
{14245}{14349}-Shit, we on Channel 5!|-I'm gonna blast these fools!
{15013}{15101}-What was that, a bazooka?|-You shot the wrong brother.
{15106}{15209}-I'll find the guy with the cannon.|-Hands behind your back.
{15225}{15330}I'm calling Johnnie Cochran.|I got his number. You're going down.
{15367}{15399}Okay, showtime.
{15479}{15508}Stop, police!
{15811}{15876}Okay, round two, baby.
{15901}{15965}-Freeze! L.A.P.D.!|-Undercover narcotics!
{15970}{16054}-Drop it!|-We got an officer-involved shooting!
{16059}{16193}Put your weapon down, right now!|Right now! Down!
{16271}{16313}Good job, officer!
{16520}{16651}-Smile for the camera, Ice Trey.|-Get back here! You're under arrest!
{16723}{16820}Turn that shit off!|Turn that shit off!
{17044}{17098}Out of my way! Police officer!
{17274}{17299}Look out!
{17469}{17514}Get that camera out of here!
{17700}{17752}-Are you okay?|-lt went through my vest.
{17757}{17829}-We need an R.A. unit. Get away!|-I'm staying.
{17834}{17936}-Get the goddamn camera out of here.|-I'm just doing my job.
{17962}{17999}What are you doing?
{18033}{18073}Get a real job.
{18145}{18235}Talk to us.|Give us some information, something.
{18308}{18387}-Have a statement?|-Don't break the police tape.
{18393}{18471}-We have a right--|{y:i}-To keep on the other side.
{18476}{18563}Aren't you the cop who got busted|with his own cuffs?
{18568}{18631}Think an officer doing his job|is funny?
{18636}{18738}Let's see how funny it is|when I move this tape back 20 feet.
{18743}{18811}-He'll be a "Bloopers" classic.|-Get B-roll.
{18816}{18936}Come over the tape, you'll get B-roll|of me kicking your ass down to Sunset.
{18944}{19015}-Detective Preston!|-Detective Preston!
{19058}{19180}-Why did you shoot the camera?|-Are you a loose cannon?
{19254}{19283}{y:i}What happened?
{19427}{19480}-Give me all you got.|-Brad?
{19485}{19520}Hi, Chase. Go.
{19524}{19620}I have the show to pull your|network from the ratings toilet.
{19625}{19705}-You can do public executions?|-Meet Mitch Preston.
{19744}{19829}-You know I don't read.|-Look at the pictures. Annie.
{19834}{19902}{y:i}Get that f***ing thing out of here!
{19907}{19935}What was that?
{19943}{20017}"Detective Preston|destroys Maxis TV camera."
{20022}{20094}-That's ours.|-"Rogue cop guns down camera."
{20099}{20133}-We can sue.|-Exactly.
{20142}{20243}He's Dirty Harry, he's real|and we've got him by the balls.
{20248}{20338}I see where you're going with this.|A reality show.
{20347}{20417}-How is it different than "Cops"?|-Did you see?
{20422}{20468}He's a modern-day cowboy.
{20472}{20574}He's sexy, volatile. He's a bad boy,|and women love bad boys.
{20579}{20651}-He could frisk me.|-You like getting frisked?
{20660}{20743}Brad, focus. Want to see it again|in slow motion?
{20748}{20803}-I get the point. Shit!|-What?
{20808}{20912}-I was outbid for an "A-Team" lunch box.|-Okay, Brad.
{20919}{21043}-So we've got this Mitch Preston?|-We're with him 24 hours a day.
{21048}{21165}Because he's gonna blow again,|and when he does, we'll be there.
{21173}{21240}If he makes a lot of arrests,|he gets a prize?
{21245}{21304}-Who gets the prize?|-This isn't a game show.
{21308}{21427}This is one man, on his own,|kicking ass and taking names.
{21483}{21557}-Can we give him a partner?|-That's a good idea.
{21568}{21688}-We'll give him a funny-minority type.|-That'll get the NAACP off my back.
{21693}{21768}-Or is it the NCAA?|-Do we have a deal?
{21773}{21830}-Fine, go make a pilot.|-No, Brad.
{21835}{21909}This guy isn't a pilot, he's a series.
{21914}{21992}Trust me.|I'll stake my entire reputation on it.
{22005}{22138}What reputation? You still get shit|for faking the flammable pajama story.
{22143}{22209}You can't tell me that wasn't good TV.
{22214}{22326}Are you in or out? I'm pitching|this at Fox in half an hour.
{22333}{22416}-I'll give a six-episode commitment.|-Yes!
{22421}{22546}But if it's all pit stops at Krispy|Kreme, I'm pulling the plug...
{22551}{22638}-...and you're out of a job.|-We'll all be out of a job.
{22643}{22734}What do they teach you in China?|Let's go. Bring it on.
{22757}{22810}-You rocked!|-We're screwed.
{22815}{22916}-We know nothing about these shows.|-There are rules.
{22921}{23013}Call L.A.P.D. and get clearances.|And find a cameraman.
{23018}{23099}-ls Julio out of traction?|-I'll call the hospital.
{23104}{23234}-What if our Dirty Harry says no?|-Everybody wants to be on TV.
{23399}{23517}10-36. It looks like the stolen cuffs|were an inside job.
{23522}{23580}That's very funny, guys.
{23613}{23662}Very funny. Very well-written.
{23820}{23896}What are you reading,|the Jenny Craig newsletter?
{23901}{23997}FYl, my friend,|a lot of this is muscle.
{24003}{24093}It's a flyer for some new|reality-TV cop show.
{24225}{24348}-I got to be part of this.|-Thought you wanted to be a detective.
{24353}{24423}I'm a cop|and I'm a professional actor.
{24428}{24549}Your career consists of a few lines|on an episode of "Diagnosis Murder."
{24560}{24656}All I need is the right part|and I'll get my big break.
{24661}{24758}Know how old Sam Jackson was|when he got his break? He was 42.
{24763}{24872}Okay, but he's got, gosh,|what's that thing called? Talent.
{24877}{24978}I'm talented. I ain't no Sam Jackson,|but I'm talented.
{24983}{25089}Your partner will be Mitch Preston.|We know who'd wear the cuffs there.
{25096}{25140}He nailed the other lead?
{25145}{25232}He's front-page news.|Everybody's talking about him.
{25237}{25318}I'd blow his old ass off the screen|every night.
{25323}{25376}You crazy? Mitch Preston, please!
{25381}{25464}I said, "Do you wanna take your feet|off the desk?"
{25501}{25573}Get your feet off the desk.|Where's Lazy Boy?
{25578}{25667}My client's taking the Fifth.|He's the victim here.
{25692}{25799}Got yourself a pricey lawyer.|Had to sell a lot of TVs for that.
{25804}{25887}-Who's paying?|-That's privileged information.
{25892}{25966}The captain needs to see you|when you're done.
{25971}{26067}He's done. Come on, ReRun.|This interview is over.
{26072}{26169}-We don't talk, we walk.|-For now.
{26220}{26333}-Do you want me to start filming?|-Yeah, everything you see. Perfect.
{26368}{26400}Oh, my God.
{26411}{26492}This place is so depressing.|It looks like a tomb.
{26497}{26545}Well, you wanted reality.
{26550}{26627}We need a reality change.|This is hideous.
{26648}{26764}I'm not doing it.|Let them follow somebody else.
{26769}{26860}They don't want anyone else.|You the man of the hour.
{26865}{26972}-All I did was shoot a video camera.|-You made us look like savages.
{26976}{27051}-The network is suing for $10 million.|-What?
{27056}{27145}They said you could have killed|their cameraman.
{27150}{27203}Maybe I should have killed him.
{27220}{27346}The chief already cut the deal.|Do the show, and they drop the suit.
{27352}{27424}What?|That's extortion! They can't do that.
{27429}{27535}We need good PR.|Community relations are in the toilet.
{27540}{27653}-You the best detective we got.|-So, what about this big gun?
{27658}{27777}Am I supposed to let them follow me|around while I track down the weapon?
{27784}{27889}-Look, I did an episode of "Cops" once.|-You did an episode of "Cops"?
{27894}{27966}You forget the camera is even there.
{27971}{28093}-This is real work. I'm not an actor.|-No one is saying you can't work.
{28107}{28232}But you screwed up. And now|you've got to play ball. End of story.
{28267}{28379}You'll be reporting|to the show's producer, Chase Renzi.
{28384}{28454}Chase Renzi? Is that a real name?
{28463}{28555}I won't take orders from some|coked-out Hollywood dickhead.
{28560}{28625}Not in a million years.|That I won't do.
{28631}{28712}That's good,|because she doesn't have a dick.
{28743}{28845}Check her out for yourself.|She's outside, waiting for you.
{28959}{29018}Well. Better looking than I thought.
{29062}{29197}We gotta bring in color, some light.|Do you think these windows move?
{29224}{29269}Detective Preston, hi.
{29274}{29347}I can see you're busy.|We'll talk tomorrow.
{29352}{29395}He's not very friendly.
{29400}{29480}Find out where he eats.|Make a reservation for two.
{29756}{29828}-Here you go, cover boy.|-Thanks.
{29856}{29955}Detective Preston, Chase Renzi.|It's a pleasure to meet you.
{29960}{30047}-How you doing?|-Good. I see you've already ordered.
{30063}{30146}-Make it quick, I have work to do.|-What can I get you?
{30153}{30248}Same as him. A cheeseburger, rare,|fries and a Coke.
{30256}{30302}-Diet?|-Regular.
{30367}{30440}So, Detective Preston....|Can I call you Mitch?
{30480}{30567}Why don't I just launch|into a few basic questions...
{30572}{30682}-...and find out what makes you tick.|-I don't tick.
{30697}{30774}-Sure you do. Everybody ticks.|-Not me.
{30804}{30888}Tell me about yourself.|You have a girlfriend, a wife?
{30893}{30951}-Ex-wife.|-Ex-wife.
{30956}{31009}Was it a painful divorce?
{31024}{31129}I only ask because I was divorced,|and I know it can be difficult.
{31134}{31175}I mean, did you drink?
{31180}{31291}Lady, I'm here because my captain|made me. I had no choice.
{31296}{31383}I have no interest in you,|your questions or your show.
{31390}{31491}Not only do I understand|your resistance, I appreciate it.
{31500}{31541}You do, huh? Good.
{31546}{31676}I'm not into making the same bullshit|cop show we've seen a million times.
{31680}{31791}That's why I believe if we're honest|and open with each other...
{31796}{31867}...we could do something|very special here.
{31888}{31951}I don't know|what you're talking about.
{31956}{32043}-I'm talking about reality, Mitch.|-There you go.
{32051}{32125}Letting the world find out|who you really are.
{32136}{32239}You're looking for loose cannon,|cop-on-the-edge "Serpico" bullshit.
{32244}{32315}I'm telling you,|you're wasting your time.
{32356}{32406}See that anger, Mitch?
{32415}{32466}It's working for you.
{32471}{32551}The audience will connect|with that in a major way.
{32558}{32602}I'm out of here.
{32611}{32693}I'll call you later|to discuss your new partner.
{32735}{32792}Want that in a doggy bag?
{32828}{32917}No.|Thanks, though. It was delicious.
{33020}{33111}-How did it go? Is he intense?|-I need cherry Tums, quick.
{33116}{33225}-ls he psyched about the show?|-lt may be harder than I thought.
{33245}{33302}-Hey!|-You son of a bitch!
{33432}{33483}Freeze! L.A.P.D.!
{33692}{33759}Wait! Wait!
{34143}{34231}Bad idea. I only got two things|bigger than my mouth.
{34236}{34297}One of them is pointed at your head.
{34343}{34457}-You want to do this the hard way?|-I'll stick you, pig!
{34748}{34839}-Okay, officer. You nice with yours.|-You damn right.
{34844}{34968}If your boys want to know who put the|smack down on you, my badge is 38723.
{34975}{35062}I go by the name of Trey Sellars,|patrolman.
{35288}{35414}-I believe this belongs to you, ma'am.|-Chase Renzi. That was incredible.
{35424}{35525}Just doing my job, like the badge|says, protecting and serving.
{35530}{35617}-Get this psycho off me!|-What's with the Superfly shit?
{35622}{35706}-I got the situation in hand.|-Top Cop, how you doing?
{35711}{35747}This is my collar.
{35752}{35820}Never leave a suspect|who's not cuffed.
{35825}{35892}-He could've had a gun.|-Nobody got no gun.
{35897}{35993}Trey, I think you broke a rib.|Tell him to get the cuffs off.
{36000}{36063}I told you I can't do handcuffs.
{36068}{36137}Quiet!|You have the right to remain silent!
{36145}{36193}-You know each other?|-No.
{36198}{36269}Never seen him before.|Just another criminal.
{36274}{36375}Bullshit. We took a stage combat class|together last fall.
{36380}{36411}Nice try, pal.
{36416}{36502}He's just trying to weasel|his way out of the crime.
{36507}{36592}-That's what he's doing.|-He looks like a real menace.
{36597}{36631}Who wants to explain?
{36636}{36739}Trey said he'd give me $50 if I|snatched the lady's purse and ran.
{36744}{36818}He'd pull up in his police car,|jump out...
{36823}{36899}...chase me up a fence,|beat me down, kick me--
{36904}{36950}All right, all right. Okay.
{36976}{37046}I set the whole thing up.|It was a big setup.
{37096}{37171}I set it up to make it look|like I was....
{37176}{37263}-I was auditioning to get this part.|-What part?
{37268}{37330}Your partner.|We've been interviewing.
{37335}{37379}It won't be this moron.
{37384}{37452}I should report you|for impersonating a cop.
{37492}{37591}Put a lock on that "moron" shit.|Why you take everything so seriously?
{37596}{37668}You should be protecting,|not staging crimes.
{37672}{37730}-Someone could've got hurt.|-Like me.
{37735}{37813}I'm learning from a guy|who shot a news camera?
{37818}{37914}You got the part already.|I'm just trying to spruce it up.
{37919}{38021}-That's what you normally do at work.|-Better watch your mouth.
{38026}{38111}What are you gonna do,|wrap me up in caution tape?
{38142}{38223}No, I ain't gonna wrap you up|in caution tape.
{38228}{38370}But I'll tell you, punk, I might whip|your ass up and down the parking lot.
{38387}{38478}Work on your "Starsky and Hutch"|routine on your own time.
{38483}{38566}You better walk off.|I was getting ready to slap you.
{38571}{38631}-He's a disgrace.|-You'd work with him?
{38636}{38679}Never in a million years.
{38770}{38859}-I think we have good chemistry.|-Riveting.
{38864}{38923}-Amazing.|-Really?
{38956}{38995}Thank you. All right.
{39002}{39092}The guy's a joke.|There's no way I'll work with him.
{39097}{39174}I don't want to hear it.|Shit, come on.
{39234}{39258}Thanks.
{39306}{39387}You're doing this. That's an order.
{39424}{39486}{y:i}Trapped in the jaws, he struggled.
{39519}{39614}You'll never see no brothers|messing with no sharks.
{39619}{39642}Never.
{39794}{39818}Hello?
{39871}{39949}I saw you on TV,|shooting up the neighborhood.
{40034}{40124}What's going on, Vargas?|I was trying to call you, dog.
{40130}{40155}Oh, yeah?
{40160}{40247}I got cell phones, call waiting,|e-mail, voice mail...
{40252}{40322}...and I haven't heard "una chingada"|from you.
{40327}{40367}It ain't like that, dog.
{40372}{40463}I laying low till everything|dies down. It got crazy.
{40468}{40526}And did I say you could use my gun?
{40542}{40609}{y:i}You know, Lazy Boy, I trusted you.
{40622}{40667}{y:i}And you let me down.
{40672}{40763}{y:i}And now you put|{y:i}my entire shipment at risk.
{40774}{40843}{y:i}You used that gun|{y:i}without my permission.
{40908}{41018}We don't want that getting|into the wrong hands, do we now?
{41075}{41206}No, I was just borrowing it.|Just testing it out, you know?
{41244}{41363}-And how did it work?|-Real good. I got it right here.
{41480}{41518}So we cool, right?
{41603}{41661}-Yeah. We cool.|-I'm sorry about--
{41667}{41777}Don't worry. We cool, Lazy Boy. Okay?
{41783}{41823}-We're cool.|-All right.
{41828}{41917}You two have a nice night. Okay?
{41922}{41958}All right.
{42171}{42223}What the hell was that all about?
{42335}{42360}What the hell?
{42467}{42557}-What's that?|-Stop playing this shit, man.
{42603}{42626}Get down!
{43804}{43835}Freeze! L.A.P.D.
{43932}{43963}What do I do?
{43968}{44016}Cut, cut, cut, cut. Cut.
{44050}{44085}Let's do it again.
{44105}{44131}Freeze! L.A.P.D.
{44180}{44214}That how he's doing it?
{44220}{44320}I'm laying my shit out.|Freeze! L.A.P.D. That shit is right.
{44325}{44350}Ready?
{44358}{44418}Patrolling your area at Friday....
{44427}{44486}Friday night at 8. Eight.
{44496}{44547}Patrolling every Friday at 8.
{44552}{44611}Yeah, good, and be happy.
{44616}{44666}Why should I? I'm patrolling.
{44671}{44751}You're happy because|you're patrolling.
{44756}{44792}Keeping it safe, Mitch.
{44799}{44856}Patrolling every Friday at night.
{44864}{44912}Every Friday night at 8.
{45000}{45100}This guy is the worst actor|I have ever seen.
{45152}{45230}-Get out.|-Wait a minute, hold it, cut, cut.
{45235}{45323}Mitch, you can't just|toss a cameraman aside.
{45328}{45448}Give me a pad, I'll show you|how a TV cop comes through the door.
{45454}{45515}The doors fly open.
{45520}{45605}They fly open. You burst in.|You scan the room.
{45610}{45718}You do the turn, toss yourself around.|And now! You're set and--
{45723}{45794}But don't turn your head|too far from camera.
{45800}{45915}That little lady is your lover. Don't|respect her, she won't respect you.
{45920}{45996}-Always know where she is.|-She's in my way.
{46001}{46075}What's wrong?|You're getting tips from T.J. Hooker.
{46080}{46162}Which is the most underrated show|in history.
{46167}{46255}-Nobody came through a door like you.|-Thank you.
{46260}{46345}-This guy is no detective.|-I'm playing a detective.
{46350}{46414}-I'm playing detective.|-All right, guys.
{46419}{46470}-I'm playing a detective.|-Okay.
{46484}{46547}Let's go do some hood-jumping.
{46562}{46586}What's that?
{46591}{46686}-What do you think? We jump over hoods.|-Something you'd know.
{46705}{46729}Freeze!
{46752}{46873}That was great, Trey.|Beautiful. That was really great.
{46878}{47002}-Okay, Mitch. Come here.|-I'm not going on the hood of a car.
{47007}{47055}-What do you mean?|-Forget it.
{47060}{47164}I entertained viewers everywhere|in the '80s, jumping on car hoods.
{47169}{47252}One of a TV cop's greatest weapons.|I'll show you.
{47280}{47400}You gotta stop them, see? Halt!|And you throw your body. Halt!
{47482}{47513}You okay, T.J.?
{47664}{47688}Moving on.
{47696}{47733}Who stole the money?
{47738}{47771}Deep in thought.
{47776}{47867}Now the eyebrows arch,|ever so slightly.
{47884}{47938}And Hooker solves another case.
{47943}{48039}Okay? All right, Trey, you try it.|Go ahead. Ready?
{48051}{48112}-Get loose now. Loosen up. Ready?|-Yeah.
{48132}{48182}Trey, who stole the money?
{48196}{48315}Good. You nailed it, first take.|Give me five. That was good!
{48320}{48408}Okay, Mitch.|Come on, show me some magic.
{48414}{48474}Mitch, who stole the money?
{48536}{48580}Look at that, Trey. Look.
{48585}{48660}Look at the anger in his eyes.|Look at that.
{48666}{48765}See that slight squint says,|"Hey, I'm Mitch. I'm the man.
{48790}{48850}Don't mess with me."
{48864}{48921}Okay. Let's taste some drugs.
{48925}{49011}Hooker's got a bag|of white powder in his hand.
{49016}{49086}Spears it open with a pocketknife.
{49109}{49166}Takes his little pinkie...
{49171}{49218}...in the powder.
{49234}{49328}And he touches it,|gently, on his tongue.
{49369}{49406}Watch the eyebrows.
{49417}{49470}Hooker knows it's cocaine.
{49488}{49523}What if it's cyanide?
{49625}{49734}Hello? Hold on. There's a reason|real cops don't taste drugs, Bill.
{49751}{49793}It's never cyanide.
{49797}{49856}Show me the thing with your eyebrow.
{49861}{49916}-Okay, I'm on my way.|-lt's tricky.
{49924}{50027}-Where are you going?|-I gotta wash this shit out of my hair.
{50032}{50118}We have some action?|We have some action, finally.
{50403}{50447}-Beep, beep!|-Hey, Mitch.
{50451}{50527}-What'd you do to my car?|-We added micro cameras.
{50531}{50638}In the wheel, the glove compartment|and a crook-cam in the back.
{50643}{50707}-Pretend they're not there.|-Pretend.
{50712}{50827}-See? You're catching on already.|-We'll be right behind you in the van.
{50832}{50892}You'll be right behind me?
{51091}{51120}What are you doing?
{51124}{51219}I'm on the case. I'm your partner.|We're together.
{51242}{51297}Unbelievable.
{51322}{51361}What's the mean face for?
{51370}{51418}Listen. Don't speak, listen.
{51423}{51501}There's a few things|I need to tell you.
{51510}{51612}First of all, you gotta know|that I got your back covered...
{51617}{51682}...and I gotta know|you got mine covered.
{51686}{51714}No doubt.
{51718}{51843}When we're on the job you're|the only person I can depend on.
{51847}{51923}Not friends, family,|not anybody, just you.
{51928}{51951}You got that?
{51956}{52028}That's important.|There's no other way.
{52032}{52092}And it's gotta start right now.
{52156}{52256}You know, ever since I was 8,|I wanted to be a cop.
{52264}{52341}I wanted to be on the force|like Uncle Reggie.
{52346}{52435}He was the first in the family|on the force. Big muscles.
{52440}{52467}Uncle Reggie.
{52483}{52563}He used to let me ride|in the squad car with him.
{52567}{52638}Once he let me play with the siren.|From then on...
{52643}{52699}...I knew I was gonna be a cop.
{52704}{52742}Uncle Reggie.
{52764}{52798}Yeah.
{52811}{52855}My uncle--
{52920}{52989}Uncle Reggie passed away|two years ago.
{52993}{53061}He got caught in the line|of some fire.
{53087}{53182}Didn't slow me down.|I remember how he set me on my way.
{53187}{53285}He's looking down on me|from a big precinct in the sky.
{53290}{53420}He's thinking, "You've done all right,|Trey. You've done right by me."
{53496}{53563}What does that|got to do with anything?
{53568}{53665}-You got a speech, so I get a speech.|-That wasn't a speech.
{53670}{53734}That "I'm your partner."|That was a speech.
{53742}{53827}You burned up 90 seconds of air.|That was a speech.
{53832}{53931}When we get to the crime scene,|stay out of my way.
{53935}{54002}This isn't studio shit.|This is real.
{54165}{54235}-Get your camera out of here.|-Hey, watch it.
{54240}{54301}Julio has to shoot. That's the show.
{54305}{54365}He's done "Jerry Springer."
{54369}{54442}That's right. Whatever you need,|I'm there.
{54447}{54571}If I get shot, stabbed, it's cool.|Whatever. I'm getting good footage.
{54576}{54662}Just remember three words:|Go to Trey.
{54666}{54693}-I'm Trey.|-Julio.
{54698}{54774}-You worked on Springer?|{y:i}-Springer, Girls Gone Wild.
{54779}{54850}Get that camera out of here.|Who's in the bag?
{54856}{54886}We don't know yet.
{54891}{54966}Whoever shot him didn't care|for open caskets.
{54970}{55018}Thinking what I'm thinking?
{55022}{55066}I seriously doubt it.
{55084}{55165}I'm thinking there's dirty|cops on the streets...
{55170}{55254}...cleaning the streets up|on they own terms, partner.
{55259}{55336}This is payback for a drug deal|gone sour.
{55348}{55406}Whoever this guy worked for|got pissed.
{55412}{55500}Even better. This is a bad guy|retribution scenario.
{55505}{55576}Good thinking, partner.|Good thinking.
{55632}{55706}I think I can identify|one of the victims.
{55769}{55857}Those are 12-gauge, armor-piercing|uranium shells.
{55861}{55898}-Charlie.|-Hey, Mitchell.
{55903}{55992}I found explosive and incendiary|rounds scattered around.
{55998}{56079}The same gun that put holes|in your TV repair shop.
{56083}{56194}It appears to be hand-held, automatic,|with interchangeable magazines.
{56199}{56264}Technically, this gun doesn't exist.
{56270}{56362}-What do you mean?|-This gun is like the 50-foot shark.
{56366}{56400}Speak English.
{56405}{56476}It's out there,|but nobody's ever seen it.
{56489}{56542}Any idea who made it?
{56567}{56676}It's a custom job. My guess is,|it's out of Eastern Europe.
{56686}{56770}-Thanks, Charlie. Keep your eyes open.|-You bet.
{56896}{56949}-What are you doing?|-Take it easy.
{56954}{57072}-You're not supposed to touch.|-I didn't. I turned it over.
{57076}{57143}-Let me know when you touch--|-I don't have to--
{57148}{57234}-What's going on?|-He's contaminating my crime scene.
{57239}{57306}I'm doing a sweep of the area.
{57311}{57422}You never know where a crucial|bit of evidence may be hiding.
{57436}{57483}Like this, for instance.
{57488}{57596}Did anybody think to pull some prints|off this water bottle?
{57606}{57659}Can I get an evidence bag?
{57664}{57747}Put down my water.|I'm not finished drinking it.
{57794}{57837}That's an honest mistake.
{57842}{57967}You got your water amongst potential|evidence so I thought it was....
{57972}{58051}Hey, T.J., go solve the case|somewhere else.
{58059}{58106}Don't give me orders,|I'm your partner!
{58112}{58168}No, you're not,|I partner with real cops.
{58178}{58254}-Get me a copy of that report.|-All right, Mitch.
{58258}{58341}Well, I am your partner,|so you better accept that.
{58347}{58380}I am your partner!
{58446}{58566}He won't open up. You know how hard|it is to work with somebody like that?
{58572}{58697}I know. Mitch has been a lot|more resistant than I'd hoped for.
{58702}{58786}I think that you and Mitch|need some bonding time.
{58799}{58838}You're right. We do.
{58843}{58966}We need some QT time together.|Two guys hanging out, have some beers.
{58970}{59042}I'll call to see|if he wants to hang out.
{59062}{59139}Let's not call him.|Let's just go over.
{59150}{59205}-Just show up?|-Surprise him.
{59269}{59306}What are you doing?
{59315}{59403}How hard is it to say,|"Hi, Trey, nice to see you"?
{59408}{59462}Hi, Trey. What are you doing here?
{59467}{59541}We got off on the wrong foot.|I got some food.
{59546}{59617}We can eat the food and bond a bit.
{59631}{59678}-Bond?|-Yeah.
{59682}{59735}How'd you get my address?
{59756}{59816}-Hi, Mitch.|-Oh, shit.
{59822}{59863}-Yeah.|-I gave it to him.
{59868}{59947}-Will you invite us in? Don't be rude.|-Do I have to?
{59956}{60039}You got us out in the hall|like a Jehovah's Witness.
{60044}{60111}I gotta see where my star cop lives.
{60115}{60155}Come on, Mitch.
{60191}{60261}-Oh, my God.|-Mitch...!
{60330}{60363}Nice.
{60368}{60467}Got a little smell to it.|Not a stinky smell, an odd one.
{60472}{60502}What is that smell?
{60506}{60568}Is this here your actual living area?
{60572}{60708}This is my Batcave. A tunnel|in the garage leads to my mansion.
{60762}{60806}What's the problem?
{60811}{60925}Research tells us buddy cops|live in visually distinctive places.
{60929}{61066}Like a trailer on the beach or|a loft downtown. That kind of thing.
{61070}{61154}Your research shows that, huh?|Where does he live?
{61167}{61238}I rent a guesthouse from a producer.
{61242}{61311}-Kind of gives off a "Magnum" vibe.|-Totally.
{61316}{61412}It's unique. You know what, Mitch?|We can make this work.
{61420}{61477}Did a crackhead make this cup?
{61502}{61600}-lt's not visually exciting enough?|-No. It's just--
{61612}{61736}The point is to let the audience|in on all aspects of your life.
{61741}{61859}They want to spend time in a place|that speaks to your personality.
{61864}{61931}This does speak to my personality.
{61941}{62040}Mitch, I think you need some time|away from the job.
{62049}{62115}I just found the crackhead's shop.
{62128}{62168}Hey, don't go in there.
{62172}{62244}This is what you smell|all over the place.
{62248}{62326}Wow, a pottery studio!
{62332}{62414}You're full of surprises.|How long you been doing this?
{62419}{62519}-Six years, give or take.|-You really got a knack for it.
{62524}{62594}This room's off-limits.|It's not for show.
{62599}{62654}Okay, Mitch.
{62659}{62732}We haven't done any bonding|at all yet.
{62741}{62806}Bond with yourself, I got work to do.
{63082}{63132}Hey!
{64433}{64462}Check this out.
{64466}{64536}Must be some Hollywood dickhead.
{65804}{65898}-Not bad, huh?|-A cop never slides across the hood.
{65904}{66028}-Why? It's not police procedure?|-Your holster scratches the paint.
{66154}{66185}Nice.
{66254}{66309}They can buff that shit out.
{66316}{66389}-I'm trying for detective.|-You take the exam?
{66393}{66466}-Twice.|-And you think you won't fail again?
{66470}{66523}Now I'm working with Mitch Preston.
{66528}{66644}Give me some tips, and I'll tip you|on how to look better on camera.
{66649}{66763}-Tips like what?|-You wear plaids, like fishermen.
{66768}{66867}That's ugly shit. Wear solids.|You look slimmer on camera.
{66877}{66949}-I'll keep that in mind.|-Got any tips for me?
{66953}{67039}Yeah, stay out of my way|and I won't shoot you.
{67091}{67138}What the hell's going on?
{67143}{67259}Welcome to America's window|on your world.
{67284}{67307}What is this?
{67312}{67408}-We made your workspace camera-ready.|-My work space?
{67413}{67519}I think it captures the reality|of an inner-city precinct.
{67524}{67580}Is this where you do the makeup?
{67584}{67697}No. This is good. You have to see it.|Mitch, you have to see this.
{67711}{67806}-Look at your desk. It's so beautiful.|-ls this my desk?
{67811}{67917}That's your desk. And that's yours,|Mitch. We didn't change it.
{67924}{68006}But this is a confessional. All right?
{68010}{68061}Talk about anything you want.
{68066}{68132}You can talk about the job,|each other...
{68136}{68245}...your sex lives. I mean,|only if you want to. Direct to camera.
{68250}{68349}-No, thanks.|-You could put a pottery wheel there.
{68355}{68436}Look, Mitch, this is an integral|part of the show.
{68441}{68528}You're obligated to spend|five minutes a day in here.
{68533}{68636}We've provided a chair.|All you have to do is sit and share.
{68640}{68714}-Share?|-Learn how to turn on your heart light.
{68719}{68759}-Exactly.|-Chase!
{68764}{68826}Brad loves the promo footage.
{68831}{68943}-But they need a catch phrase.|-I got one. "I wish I was dead."
{68950}{69009}You need a catch phrase? I got it.
{69044}{69142}-When I'm about to make a bust--|-When did you ever make a bust?
{69162}{69187}Don't tell me.
{69192}{69287}When I'm about to make a bust,|to get in the moment...
{69292}{69432}...I take three deep breaths and say to|myself, "Okay, Trey, it's showtime!"
{69437}{69492}-You say that?|-That's stupid.
{69497}{69547}-What's stupid about it?|-Know what?
{69552}{69603}Don't say it, please.
{69608}{69697}No, I have to say it, Mitch.|"Showtime." It's amazing.
{69702}{69841}-That could be the name of our show!|-See? It's not stupid. It's perfect.
{69855}{69905}Say it again for the camera.

{70063}{70086}It's showtime!
{70444}{70575}{y:i}This is Harley Barley taking calls|{y:i}from fans of the new series "Showtime".
{70580}{70674}{y:i}Let's go to Pete from Idaho.|{y:i}You're on the air.
{70680}{70755}{y:i}I wanted to say to Mitch,|{y:i}I know how you feel.
{70760}{70851}{y:i}I mean, I got a lot of anger|{y:i}inside me too.
{70857}{70935}{y:i}I want to take my gun|{y:i}and blow everybody away!
{70940}{71031}{y:i}Thank you, Pete.|{y:i}You sure you're not calling from Waco?
{71035}{71105}{y:i}Let's go to line three.|{y:i}Mandy, you're on.

{71753}{71810}{y:i}I'm gonna be honest, you know.
{71815}{71906}{y:i}It's natural, when you're in|{y:i}a situation that's shitty...
{71914}{72049}{y:i}...to think about what it might be|{y:i}like to have a different partner.
{72131}{72202}{y:i}Like somebody that was|{y:i}closer to your age.
{72208}{72277}{y:i}Charismatic, with a little flair|{y:i}and shit.
{72282}{72347}{y:i}You kicking it with him,|{y:i}have some fun.

{72588}{72662}{y:i}Me and a Wesley Snipes type?
{72667}{72716}{y:i}Can you imagine?
{72743}{72774}{y:i}Wesley Snipes type?
{72926}{73004}{y:i}Do you feel lucky, punk?|{y:i}Huh? Do you?
{73012}{73137}{y:i}Basically, I'm saying the whole show|{y:i}is slowed down just a half a beat...
{73145}{73254}{y:i}-I'm too old for this shit.|{y:i}-...so Mitch can keep up.
{73259}{73341}{y:i}Because I'm working out.|{y:i}I do free-weights.
{73345}{73382}{y:i}Go ahead. Make my day.
{73389}{73456}{y:i}I'm taking care of mine. Mitch is not.
{73506}{73593}{y:i}That's it. I'm taking care of mine|{y:i}and Mitch is not.
{73598}{73676}Trey, look at this. It's all for you.

{75498}{75614}-How come we're not talking to him?|-Because he's sitting in county.
{75618}{75696}A jailhouse.|That could be the next episode.
{75702}{75760}Forget it. I put him there.
{75766}{75831}He's the one who knows|about this gun.
{75836}{75914}He won't talk to me. I already tried.
{75942}{75970}He'll talk to me.
{75978}{76040}What makes you think|he'll talk to you?
{76045}{76110}I won't go in like a bulldog like you.
{76114}{76201}-I'll talk. I'll be in character.|-ln character!
{76218}{76294}That's great.|You mean, like undercover?
{76299}{76430}A little finesse, catch him off guard,|have him think I'm someone else.
{76445}{76526}Character. What kind of a character?
{76541}{76573}I don't know.
{76657}{76780}ReRun! How you doing, my man? I'm Trey|Sellars from the Justice Channel.
{76785}{76881}-Have a seat, please. You being strong?|-Yeah.
{76886}{77005}{y:i}-Thanks for coming. You okay?|{y:i}-I ain't heard of no Justice Channel.
{77010}{77121}That's because we got started|while you was rotting away in here.

{77246}{77352}-He's got talent, Mitch, come on.|-We're wasting our time.
{77366}{77419}Is that a new shirt?
{77424}{77487}It looks good. I like you in solids.
{77492}{77568}What's this shit about you|getting me out?
{77572}{77700}Not me, brother, the TV show.|I'm hosting a show called "Framed."
{77708}{77793}Let me tell you about the show.|We spotlight you.
{77798}{77896}Put a light on your situation.|Let the people see you.
{77901}{78009}{y:i}Hopefully, we get a grassroot|{y:i}campaign started and get you out.
{78014}{78088}I got three people out.|You can be number four.
{78091}{78189}-Like Mandela.|-Similar. You ain't as noble.

{78460}{78503}-Not so loud.|-Say what?
{78511}{78566}I wasn't that loud.
{78570}{78643}You don't have to talk too loud.
{78648}{78701}Shouldn't my lawyer be here?
{78706}{78805}That's the wrong thing you can do.|Let me explain something.
{78809}{78892}Research has shown people|don't want to hear lawyers.
{78896}{78973}They want to hear it|straight from your mouth.
{78977}{79048}I got Johnnie Cochran.|No offense, bro.
{79053}{79134}Cochran will get a response|I'm not trying to get.
{79138}{79212}I'm trying to get people|to connect with you.
{79217}{79287}If they see Johnnie Cochran|in a $1000 suit...
{79292}{79369}...they ain't going to get you|out of prison.
{79374}{79469}Ain't no cops here.|Just me and you. Brother to brother.

{80118}{80224}{y:i}Brother, look at me. They selling|{y:i}your black ass down the river.
{80230}{80265}You say "ass" on TV?
{80270}{80343}This is cable.|I can say whatever I want to.
{80347}{80399}Did they tell you plea-bargain?
{80404}{80447}Take the hit, do the time?
{80452}{80506}That's what was said, isn't it?
{80550}{80576}Yeah.
{80606}{80659}See if you can get a name.
{80664}{80700}{y:i}It's time, ReRun.
{80704}{80789}It is time to shine the light|on who's behind this.
{80794}{80853}Who's the puppet master?
{80861}{80921}Whose time are you doing?
{80926}{80997}While you're in here|he's smelling freedom.
{81002}{81053}-And tasting it.|-What you smell?
{81058}{81155}-Ass.|-Ass and feet, and tension and stress.

{81448}{81524}{y:i}Look in the camera and say it.|{y:i}I'm with you.
{81535}{81583}I'm right here with you.
{81612}{81690}All the people out there in TV land...

{82821}{82856}Find out where he is.
{82861}{82905}You going down, baby.
{82910}{82953}You made a connection.
{82957}{83057}When the people see this,|they'll get rallied up. I can tell.
{83062}{83142}Now, where would a guy|like Vargas kick it?
{83170}{83241}-You trying to get a brother killed--|-Not at all.
{83246}{83327}I do this for the viewers.|We don't point fingers.
{83332}{83453}We'll say, "If you don't want to run|into Vargas don't go to this place."
{83458}{83609}Hanging out with him, you wind up|in this place. That's how you got here.
{83613}{83665}Look to the camera.
{83670}{83784}Think about the babies, the children.|Save the babies, brother.
{83803}{83844}{y:i}People...

{87750}{87861}-Hope this doesn't ruin your appetite.|-I got a strong stomach.
{87893}{87994}-Who's he?|-One of your employees. You know that.
{88006}{88096}A lot of people work for me.|I don't know this guy.
{88110}{88166}And what about this guy?
{88239}{88287}What's his name?
{88410}{88449}He's big...
{88460}{88572}...probably big enough to go through|those bulletproof vests you wear.
{88617}{88645}Am I right?
{88711}{88778}Bulletproof vest, huh?
{88787}{88815}And you are...?
{88823}{88926}You can't miss me. I'm across|the street on the billboard.

{89078}{89122}What's your line again?
{89126}{89162}"It's showtime!"
{89178}{89236}It's showtime!

{89419}{89495}What'll you do?|Try me in The People's Court?
{89499}{89594}We're gonna be watching|your punk ass 24-7, slick.
{89649}{89708}Are you going to arrest me?
{89727}{89842}Because if you're not, get out.|Or I have to call the real cops.
{89846}{89919}-Hey, we are the real cops.|-Sure you are.
{89923}{90014}-You don't think we're real cops?|-I think you're a joke.
{90058}{90121}It's all right. He cannot touch me.
{90126}{90257}Not this time, but next time|I'll drag you out of here in cuffs.

{92106}{92166}...mime. Is that it? Mime?
{92170}{92218}Yeah, I'm a mime. I mime.
{92232}{92319}I'm curious about these movies:|{y:i}Beach Party Bonzo?
{92324}{92449}Yes, it's a semi-independent film.|Very low-budget, semi-independent.
{92454}{92536}{y:i}Planet Gorthon, 31 A.D.?
{92554}{92652}Kind of light porn,|but I don't even want to go into it.
{92663}{92740}You try out for the Village People?
{92758}{92857}-I'm adding pottery to that list.|-Don't knock pottery.

{93430}{93498}-Can I ask you something?|-Yeah.
{93501}{93564}Why'd you become a cop, anyway?
{93571}{93686}-Because I was a shitty waiter.|-You mean you were a better mime?

{93831}{93877}I got the car. Don't worry.

{95278}{95332}Okay, Mitch. Just relax, okay?
{95337}{95431}We didn't touch the pottery.|We're giving you sex appeal.
{95435}{95506}It looks like a gay porno star|lives here.
{95510}{95561}And here they are, right here.
{95566}{95596}Just stop.
{95601}{95683}You can't change the place|without my permission.
{95688}{95767}You don't have the right.|Get this dog out.
{95786}{95823}Powder's yours.
{95827}{95895}Mine? I don't want some dog.|What is this?
{95901}{95973}He used to be a drug sniffer|in the K-9 unit.

{96022}{96140}-He makes you look sympathetic.|-A kennel won't make him sympathetic.
{96145}{96216}Want me to be sympathetic?|Put my stuff back.
{96220}{96298}I'll be sympathetic.|Until then, I won't be.
{96322}{96399}How can you say no to that face,|Mitch?
{96435}{96506}I can say no very easily.|No, Powder. Get out.
{96511}{96550}Don't be like that.
{96555}{96588}It's just a dog, man.
{96593}{96655}Come here, Powder.|You're a good boy.
{96713}{96741}Shit!
{96746}{96811}Maybe Mitch is right.|Get rid of the dog.

{105720}{105777}I think two drops of pee came out.
{105906}{105998}You're off the show, Sellars.|You're busted to patrol.
{106257}{106301}"Showtime" is over.
{106306}{106359}And we're screwed.
{106380}{106453}See you back on the tape, Top Cop.
{106544}{106627}Being a police officer is not|what you see on TV!
{106632}{106702}I've never seen you do|anything like this!
{106707}{106777}Your showboating|put this city at risk.
