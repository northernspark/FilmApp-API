Hervé Joncour:
Steaming water.

Strange trees.

00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:41,694

Hervé:
Why should I tell you about it?

12
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:28,535
Why now?

13
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:34,685
Maybe I just need
to tell someone...

14
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,625
and maybe it's you.

15
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:46,087
I guess it all began
when I came back home

16
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,888
on leave from the army...

17
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,699

Helene:
When are you going?

21
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:01,622
I leave Thursday.

22
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:06,141
And when will you be back?

23
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:14,549
Helene: One day, I'll have
a whole garden of these-

24
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,900
hundreds, thousands.

25
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,126
Hervé: To make her happy,
I would have knelt down

26
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:21,081
and started planting
a garden that very day.

27

[Helene laughing]

28
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:23,452
Oh.

29
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:27,864
Hervé: But I had
a military career to pursue.

30
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:29,695
My father insisted.
[Helene laughing]

31

[clock chiming] Mayor Joncour:
Things are heating up in Austria.

32
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:35,263
I think it will come
to a head by summer.

33
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:37,082
The outcome is inevitable.

34
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,183
They won't know what to do when

35
00:04:39,184 --> 00:04:40,556
they're faced with
our military forces.

36
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:43,707
They will crumble like
a stale linzer torte.

Mayor Joncour:
What do you think, son?

More fish, dear?

39
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,747
Mayor Joncour:
The Austrians are fools, hmm?

40
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:54,870
I remember,
when I was in the military,

41
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:56,700
Hervé: I couldn't stop thinking about her.
We used to say that

42
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:59,197
if the Austrian's ever
decided to attack,

43
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,938
we'd finish our lunch...

44
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:05,084
Hervé: Then, someone came along
to solve my problem.

45
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,690
Man: Can I help you?

46
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:08,016
Please, sir!

[door slams into wall]

00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:12,180
I'm sorry, your honor.

49
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,451
You may leave us.

50
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:16,007
What can I do for you,
Baldabiou?

51
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:17,688
You know
what this is?

52
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:21,543
Woman's stuff.

53
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:22,844
Wrong.

54
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,334
It's money, a man's stuff.

55
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:28,788
Really?

56
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,112
And why do I need to hear this?

57
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,860
I'm going to repair the silk mill.

58
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:34,321
[chuckling] The mill?

59
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,981
Where will you find the money?

60
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,312
That's my problem.

61
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:40,843
Just make sure no one
gets in my way.

62
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,802
Hervé: Baldabiou repaired
the old silk mill in six months,

63
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,323
Baldabiou: be careful.

64
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:49,422
or so I was told,
as I was still in the army.

65
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:50,803
Careful.

66
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:55,693
By the time I returned
the following year...

67
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,617
there were three more mills...

68
00:05:58,618 --> 00:05:59,488
[cow mooing]

69
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,652
and more money than our town
had ever seen.

70
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:04,859
Baldabiou:
You know what that is?

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,107
Mayor Joncour: Money.

72
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,718
Wrong. It's proof
that I was right.

73
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:11,287
Congratulations.

74
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:14,304
And what do you
want me to do now?

75
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:17,905
Nothing. You'll be the mayor
of a very rich town.

76
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,337
Marry me, Helene.

Mr. Baldabiou.

Hervé.

83
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,618
I hear you would
like to speak with me.

84
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,949
Yes, but not here.

85
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:03,785
Do you play?

86
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:04,942
Uh, no.

87
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,691
Why me?

88
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:10,224
I need a young man,
a clever man.

89
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,945
Yes, but I'm
not looking for work.

90
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:16,804
It's not work I'm offering you.

91
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,595
I'm offering you a life.

92
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:22,296
A strange illness
has entered into the sheds.

93
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:24,294
Half the silkworms
are either sick or dead.

94
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:25,500
It's the same in Lyon,

95
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:27,955
The same everywhere,
as far as Turkey.

96
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:28,816
What is it?

97
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:31,867
Nobody knows,
but the clock is ticking.

98
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,113
We cannot solve the problem,
but we can get round it.

99
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:37,324
We have to. Otherwise,
this town will starve.

100
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:40,612
I need you to go
and get healthy eggs...

101
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,221
In Africa.

102
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,626
Africa?

103
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,169
Hervé:
I wish I could,

104
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,374
but my-my leave is up
in two days.

105
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,079
Uh, I have to return
to the barracks.

106
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,000
Who says so?

107
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,069
My father.

108
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,071
Your father?

109
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,409
I'll take care of him.

[priest reciting
benediction in Latin]

111
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:11,271

Et spiritus sancti.

Altar boy: Amen.
All: Amen.

116
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,489
[applause] Hervé: Two weeks
later, I gave up my uniform...

117
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:32,888
and I started a new life.

118
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:42,123
I thought love
would always be that easy.

119
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:50,638
Hervé:
What are you writing?

120
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,590
Nothing.

121
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,030
Nothing?

122
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,572
I just spoke
with Baldabiou.

123
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:14,864
I leave a week from tomorrow.

124
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,586
How long?

125
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,179
Weeks...

126
00:09:27,129 --> 00:09:28,059
Maybe months.

127
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,658
Make it weeks.

128
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:38,939
[wind blowing]

129
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,828
Hervé: That was 1862,
the year of the Great Snow.

130
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:48,348
I set off to Egypt
to get the eggs.

131
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:51,358
It took me a month
to find them...

132
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,924
and a little less to come back.

133
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,505
[steam engine thumping]

134
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:01,314
I knew nothing about silk
or how it was made.

135
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,047
All I new was that

136
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:06,159
I had to keep those tiny eggs
away from heat,

137
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,320
keep them clean,

138
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,112
and bring them back
before they'd hatched.

139
00:10:10,113 --> 00:10:12,263
[chuckles]
That's all I knew.

140
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,189
But back at the village,

141
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,976
[baby crying]
someone else was about to hatch-

142
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:19,027
Ludovic Berbek.

143
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:24,296
Beatrice was so proud
to show off her baby that day.

144
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:40,808
[sigh]

145

[snoring]

149
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:07,721
How was Africa?

150
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,072
We never talked about it.
[billiard balls clack]

151
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:12,293
It was beautiful.

152
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:15,494
Tired, but...
but very beautiful.

153
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,189
I have bad news.

154
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,115
I found dead worms.

155
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,519
Only a few, but, still, too many.

156
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:30,795
Baldabiou: Seems the pébrine got
to Egypt before you did.

157
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:31,846
Hervé: pébrine?

158
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:37,975
Baldabiou:
They've given it a name.

159
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:43,658
I need you to go to Japan.

160
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:45,704
Japan?

161
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,980
Where is that?

162
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:50,196
It's that way.

163
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,225
Baldabiou: Just keep going
to the end of the world.

164
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:53,890
[lays down cue]
Let me show you.

165
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:56,631
They make the most
perfect silk there.

166
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:58,675
I held some in my hand once.

167
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,589
It was like holding nothing.

168
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,878
They've been making silk for over
a thousand years,

169
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,309
and they've never even heard
of a diseased egg.

170
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:10,458
It'll be a longer journey
this time.

171
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,465
Baldabiou:
Much longer.

172
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,774
Before I speak to the others,

173
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,905
I have to know that
you're ready for this.

174
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:26,018
Baldabiou:
But there's a risk.

175
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:28,385
The journey's long and dangerous,

176
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,505
And it's forbidden to travel
inland beyond Japan's harbors.

177
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:32,754
No Westerner has done it.

178
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,025
And, yet, a place

179
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,415
where no English broker
or Chinese trader can go

180
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,038
is a place where no
disease can enter.

181
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,159
And why should we succeed
where others have failed?

182
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,616
Baldabiou: There's no evidence
that we will succeed,

183
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:44,364
But I have it from
a trustworthy source

184
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:47,151
That the Japanese are trading
their silk on the black market.

185
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:50,189
We're interested in making silk,
not buying it.

186
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,642
I want to send Hervé
to trade for eggs, not silk.

187
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:55,973
But there's still no guarantee,
no matter how good the plan.

188
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:57,464
How much?

189
00:12:57,555 --> 00:12:59,235
At best, 10,000 francs.

190
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:02,488
And at worst?

191
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:08,714
His life.

192
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,480
What is it?

193
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,541
I can't do this.

194
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,487
I cannot go.

195
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:27,002
But you've already said you would go.
I wasn't thinking...

196
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:28,421
about us.

197
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:34,582
I don't want you to give
this up because of me.

198
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:38,908
It's better than you going off
to fight some stupid war.

199
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:45,052
You'll be back by spring.

200
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:03,198
Don't forget.

201
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:06,545
My Japanese contact will
meet you in Vladivostok.

202
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,696
Yes.
And her letters for him.

203
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,620
He'll help you find
the village.

204
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,076
All you have to do
is bring back the eggs.

205
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:15,158
[chuckling]
That's all?

206
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,609
Good luck.

207
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,519
Hervé: I'll always love you.

208
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,730
Helene: I will always love you.

209
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:53,567
Hervé: And so, I headed off
to the end of the world.

210
00:14:58,808 --> 00:14:59,798
[horse neighs]

211
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:02,415
I crossed the border at Ségny.

212
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,921
Hervé: Then I journeyed through
Europe.

[locomotive chugging]

214

[train whistle blows]

216
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:28,167
Through Moravia...

217
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:30,667
And on to Kiev.

218
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,041

[whistle blowing]

220
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:43,996
Hervé: I hired a caravan
to cross the Russian steppes-

221
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,070
Three thousand miles
of ice and storm.

222
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:56,704
I had my Christmas dinner
at Lake Baikal,

223
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,632
And I thought of Helene...

224
00:15:58,769 --> 00:15:59,989
always.

225
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,926
Then I followed the Amur River
along the Chinese border...

226
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:06,917
[wave crashes]

227
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:10,574
Until I reached the ocean.

228
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,619
Hervé: I stopped eleven days
in Vladivostok,

229
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,830
Where a Japanese guide
handed me my disguise.

230
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:29,388
Hervé: I sailed across the sea
on a smuggler's ship.

Hervé: And, finally,
I reached the port of Sakata.

236
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:49,942
[bird calling]

237
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,245

238
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:56,207
and haunting.

239
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,001
Hervé: The Mogami River.

240
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:08,694
Hervé:
The snows of Yamagata.

241
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:18,106
Hervé: I climbed
the mountains of Shinobu,

242
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,842
Where new guides
were waiting for me.

243
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:35,098
Hervé:
And for the next three days,

244
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,259
we continued through the peaks.

245
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,969
Then, after countless freezing
days and sleepless nights...

246
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:51,537
I reached my destination.

are eggs of fish.

No, I'm not. I'm not.

00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,915
[sheep bleating, bell clanging]

334
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,569
Hervé: Now.

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:33,909
[sheep bleating]

336
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:36,064
Helene: Oh, my.

337
00:29:36,711 --> 00:29:37,981
Well, what is it?

338
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,449
Hervé: It's your garden.

339
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,327
Helene: It's my garden?

340
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:44,308
Well, not quite.
Not... Yet.

341
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,568
For now, it's a plot of land,
our land.

342
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:51,428
And the house is also ours,
if you want it.

343
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:56,351
This is where
we'll grow old, Helene.

344
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,092
But, I don't understand.

345
00:29:58,225 --> 00:30:01,025
The eggs have hatched.
They're perfect.

346
00:30:01,053 --> 00:30:02,384
This year's production
will be huge,

347
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:05,535
and Baldabiou has
already paid us our share.

348
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:07,747
We are rich, Helene.

349
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:10,733
I mean, we're very, very rich.
[gasp]

350
00:30:10,873 --> 00:30:12,313
[exhales]

351
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:15,484
All this for such tiny eggs.

352
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:20,962
Hervé:
And the eggs became worms.

353
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,480
And the worms grew stronger.

354
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:25,831
[spindles squeaking]

355
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:33,163
Hervé: And we all grew richer.

[patrons talking and laughing]

357
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:42,806
Nice try.

358
00:30:44,037 --> 00:30:46,118
Hervé: Isn't it difficult enough
with two hands?

359
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,615
The day the one-handed player wins,

360
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:50,866
is the day I leave town
and never come back.

361
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,942
Hervé: Like Ludovic's father.

362
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,183
I never understood
what happened to him.

363
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:00,754
Did he just disappear?

364
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:03,461
Well, first,
he stopped talking.

365
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:07,744
Then one day, he woke up,
packed a suitcase, and left.

366
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,832
Beatrice was about to have Ludovic.

367
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,453
That was quite a blow.

368
00:31:21,944 --> 00:31:24,940
But why did he stop talking
in the first place?

369
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:28,602
That's one of the many things
he never talked about.

370
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:29,883
Hm.

371
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:31,996
No, no, Papa.

372
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:33,362
Mmm!

373
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:42,322
[Beatrice singing in distance]

374
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,490
Do you think about it?

375
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,052
Sometimes.

376
00:31:57,522 --> 00:31:58,732
What do you see?

377
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:06,704
Strange trees...

378
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:13,511
chickens pecking in the dirt,
laughing children.

379
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:16,739
What about this man?

380
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:19,084
You hardly mention him.

381
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:24,689
He was closed...

382
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,065
secretive.

383
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:36,136
It's hard to remember
all of it. It...

384
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:37,407
it's fading away.

385
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:41,705
Ludovic: Papa!

386
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,020
Ludovic, crying: Papa!

387
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:50,636
I've ask Madame Berbek
to help with the chores.

388
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:52,966
The house is too much for me.

389
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:55,886
That's a good idea.

390
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,652
Ludovic is growing.
They must need the money.

391
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,090
I knew you'd understand.

392
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,479
May I see?

393
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:10,506
No, it's not finished.

394
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:13,177
I want to look at it.
No. [laughing]

395
00:33:26,776 --> 00:33:29,626
Hervé:
It was a happy time that summer.

396

[watch cover clicks]

397
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,428
Hervé: Life was simple again.
Helene: Opened his beak...

398
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,699
and he felt sick.

399
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:41,349
The cheese fell
out of his beak,

400
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:44,335
and the fox caught the cheese,
and ran off with it.

401
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:46,875
So this is the path,
and the fountain is there.

402
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:48,616
Mm-hmm.
And the lilies?

403
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:50,910
You're standing on them.

404
00:33:50,911 --> 00:33:52,431
[laughing]
Oh. Sorry.

405
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,112
You're standing on them again.

406
00:33:56,113 --> 00:33:57,360
So the lilies are everywhere.

407
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:59,821
[laughs] The lilies
are everywhere.

408
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,499
Hervé: But I knew...

409
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,609
I knew that it couldn't
last forever.

410
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,172
Hervé: Ludovic?

we won't be eating

not a potager.

Hello, Ludovic.

I've received some news
from Japan.

It may not be so easy to get in
and out the next time.

When was it easy?

418
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:48,042
Hervé: I have
Hara Jubei's protection.

419
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:49,193
I will be fine.

420
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:52,247
What if you don't
make it to him?

421
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:55,864
Hervé...

422

Listen...

423
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:03,014
you have a decision to make.

424
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,559
You make it.

00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:23,998
Au revoir!

429
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,040

I made it to the village.

439
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:02,531
Only this time,
it was different.

440
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:05,672
This time, I was
not treated as a stranger.

So while I waited for the eggs
to be prepared,

There is no point
in being secretive.

And what about Mutzu?

00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:28,931
Schuyler:
He's still safe.

506
00:45:28,932 --> 00:45:31,135
They've been
chased to the east.

507
00:45:31,136 --> 00:45:33,757
You never know.
Things are changing fast.

508

Schuyler: Even Hara Jubei's
losing grip.

509
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:37,876
I'd be on my guard,
if I were you.

510
00:45:37,877 --> 00:45:39,042
Is that a warning?

511
00:45:39,043 --> 00:45:39,853
Mmm, mmm...

512
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:43,993

Schuyler:
You take my advice.

515
00:45:47,032 --> 00:45:49,694
Trade fast, leave as soon as you can.

She's quite something,
isn't she?

520
00:46:14,993 --> 00:46:15,991
What do you know about her?

521
00:46:15,992 --> 00:46:17,482
Not much.

522
00:46:17,907 --> 00:46:19,697
But I'll tell you this-

523
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,045
She's not what you think.

524
00:46:22,068 --> 00:46:23,338
What do you mean?

525
00:46:24,814 --> 00:46:26,204
She's not Japanese.

526
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,930
That is what they say.

527

00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,720
May we continue to trade
in peace.

534
00:47:09,504 --> 00:47:11,314
To our lasting friendship.

[man speaking Japanese]

Hervé: They gave me the eggs,
but I waited two days,

548
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:34,883
hoping she might return.

549
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:39,315
She did not.

Hervé:
And, once again, I left Japan.

552
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:06,043
This time, I had brought
back 10 boxes of eggs,

553
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,770

[crickets chirping, birds singing]

569
00:55:06,446 --> 00:55:08,066
So she's not Japanese?

570
00:55:10,565 --> 00:55:12,015
No. She was Chinese.

571
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,480
She was the Emperor's third wife.

572
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:23,129
Legend has it that
she was preparing tea

in the palace garden.

574
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:31,029
She accidentally dropped
a cocoon into the hot water...

575
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:33,659
and then she discovered

576
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,570
that a cocoon's fibers
could be unwound,

577
00:55:37,903 --> 00:55:40,399
and a thread could
be obtained from it-

578
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,200
one that was strong enough
for weaving.

on my first trip?

[billiard balls clack]

Please.

00:56:37,408 --> 00:56:38,458
Madame Blanche.

596
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,233
She runs a brothel in Lyon-

Number 12, Rue Moscat.

598
00:56:43,731 --> 00:56:45,894
Men pay a lot of money
to be with her.

599

Hervé:
And she speaks Japanese?

600
00:56:47,143 --> 00:56:48,303
She is Japanese.

601
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:50,971
Well, how did she wind up in Lyon?

602
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:52,885
She married a French merchant
in Yokohama,

603
00:56:52,886 --> 00:56:54,757
He died on their return to France,

604
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:56,788
She had to fend for herself.

605
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:16,021
Hervé: I have to go
to Lyon tomorrow.

I'll be back before nightfall.

What's wrong?

610
00:57:34,563 --> 00:57:36,183
Helene?

00:57:46,689 --> 00:57:48,309
We have to be patient.

612
00:57:53,097 --> 00:57:56,637
We've been trying to have
a child for two years.

613
00:57:59,172 --> 00:58:00,792
We have to try harder.

614
00:58:07,328 --> 00:58:08,248
Come to bed.

615
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:10,242
Come.

628
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,799
And what makes you think
you're rich enough

00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:35,947
Hervé: That is not
what I came for.

631

What do you want then?

632
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:40,754
Hervé:
I need your help.

633
00:59:41,076 --> 00:59:42,586
Never mind the price.

634
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,059
I need to know
what is written on it.

635
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:50,794
Will you help me?

636

Where did you get this?

637
01:00:13,325 --> 01:00:15,295
"Come back or I shall die. "

638
01:00:17,652 --> 01:00:19,972
Come back?
That's what it says.

639
01:00:20,773 --> 01:00:22,743
"Come back or I shall die. "

640
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:33,724
Thank you.

641
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:45,901
Forget about it.

642
01:00:48,402 --> 01:00:50,202
Not the money, the woman.

643
01:00:52,606 --> 01:00:53,826
Forget about her.

644
01:00:56,392 --> 01:00:58,702
She won't die, and you know it.

645
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,536
[patrons speaking] Baldabiou: I
went to see that fellow, Pasteur.

646
01:01:12,537 --> 01:01:13,777
Yes?

647
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:16,524
He's pretty darn clever.

648
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,443
[opening bottle]
he's discovered how to isolate

649

[pouring]
the infected eggs from the healthy ones.

650
01:01:22,898 --> 01:01:24,145
He can't cure them,

651
01:01:24,146 --> 01:01:26,226
but he can tell which ones are good.

652
01:01:26,227 --> 01:01:28,098
And the results are guaranteed.

653
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:28,969
Mmm. Really?

654
01:01:32,884 --> 01:01:35,006
There's trouble again in Japan.

655
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:36,747
This time, it's serious.

656
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,200
The French Consulate in Yokohama
have been sending dispatches.

657
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:44,329
They say it's chaos.

658
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:49,889
And this, uh,
Italian fellow, Ferreri,

659
01:01:50,652 --> 01:01:54,312
he's come back from China
with eggs, tons of them,

660
01:01:54,481 --> 01:01:57,631
Healthy from first to last,
same with Bolée.

661
01:01:58,974 --> 01:02:01,294
They're offering us a good deal.

662
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:04,288
Seven francs for the gram.

663
01:02:04,883 --> 01:02:06,623
And they'll insure them.

664
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:08,960
And with the work
that Pasteur is doing,

665
01:02:08,961 --> 01:02:10,083
we might get by on our own.

666
01:02:10,084 --> 01:02:11,304
[sets down glass]

01:02:11,915 --> 01:02:14,645
It would be madness
to go back there.

668
01:02:14,912 --> 01:02:16,062
It's too risky.

669
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:21,110
I don't want to lose you, Hervé.

670
01:02:24,565 --> 01:02:26,775
I'm going to Japan,
Baldabiou.

671
01:02:28,851 --> 01:02:32,621
Even if it means I have
to pay for the trip myself.

672
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,591
All you have to decide
is whether I'm...

673
01:02:35,592 --> 01:02:38,502
selling the eggs to you
or someone else.

674
01:02:41,417 --> 01:02:43,206
Mayor Joncour: We've heard that
the eggs coming in from Turkey

675
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:44,454
Are perfectly healthy.

676
01:02:44,455 --> 01:02:46,160
That's where
the Lyon breeders go.

677
01:02:46,161 --> 01:02:47,658
Man: The Italians, too.

678
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:49,406
Second man: Well, then
why don't we do the same?

679
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:50,654
Mayor Joncour: Japan is too dangerous.
Man: We can no longer

680
01:02:50,655 --> 01:02:52,319
afford the risks.
Baldabiou: Gentlemen.

681
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,484
Gentlemen, please.

682
01:02:53,485 --> 01:02:55,295
These eggs are unreliable.

683
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:57,517
The Japanese eggs are pristine.

684
01:02:58,229 --> 01:03:00,391
Who really knows
what's going on there?

685
01:03:00,392 --> 01:03:02,139
Very few people have seen it
with their own eyes,

686
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,303
and one of them
lives right here.

687
01:03:03,304 --> 01:03:05,718
This is my son
you are talking about.

688
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:07,340
He's made the voyage twice.

689
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:09,379
If anybody understands
the dangers, he does,

690
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,960
and he believes it can be done.

691
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:13,623
Now, I, for one, am staking my
money on another trip.

692
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:16,604
You gentlemen must
make your own decision.

693
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:30,226
Isn't there some way
you can stop him?

694
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:31,377
I'm afraid not.

695
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:37,805
Baldabiou: There is
something else.

696
01:03:41,878 --> 01:03:45,028
There seems to be some trouble
over there...

697
01:03:45,457 --> 01:03:46,327
an uprising.

698
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:50,813
It could be dangerous.

699
01:03:55,235 --> 01:03:56,441
Then I suppose all I can do

700
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:58,932
is give him a reason to come back.

701

worry about anything.

704
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:23,194
I know.

705
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:26,573
I won't.

706
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:32,642
I have protection there.

707
01:04:32,643 --> 01:04:34,553
I will...
I will be fine.

Where are they?

for you here.

Hara Jubei: Only war,
and it's not your war.

War is an expensive game.

Hara Jubei:
It has ancient laws.

767
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:45,688
There are crimes here
for which it is acceptable

768
01:12:45,689 --> 01:12:47,599
to condemn a man to death.

to reach Sakata,

01:14:08,826 --> 01:14:11,796
Where I finally found
four boxes of eggs.

785
01:14:13,196 --> 01:14:15,191
I packed the boxes
in crates filled with ice,

786
01:14:15,192 --> 01:14:17,762
fearful that they
would hatch early.

by the end of March,

And in the whole world, there
was nothing beautiful left.

Hervé:
That was a terrible summer.

802
01:16:41,787 --> 01:16:44,747
We had to close
three of the four mills.

803
01:16:46,114 --> 01:16:50,024
Baldabiou had to make up
stories to explain my failure.

804
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:55,227
Hervé: And with the thought
of all that had happened...

805
01:16:55,228 --> 01:16:59,008
how I'd failed the village,
how I'd failed Helene...

806
01:17:01,386 --> 01:17:02,836
I sank into silence.

So, here you are.

Listen, Hervé...

Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to talk to someone.

It might as well be me.

There's nothing more to say.

If things continue like this,
we'll all starve.

Something has to be done.

Do you have any ideas?

Hervé: Baldabiou.

824
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,100
We'll build a garden.

825
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:48,699
I'll hire everyone
in the village...

828
01:18:54,235 --> 01:18:57,325
And, together, we'll
build Helene's garden.

in late summer.

most of it by the fall.

835
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:25,636
Helene:
You pull that one up?

836
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:26,856
Weeds are bad for trees.

837
01:19:26,857 --> 01:19:28,270
They take their food,

838
01:19:28,271 --> 01:19:30,581
so you've got to pull them out.

839
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:34,013
Then why do we have them
if they are bad?

840
01:19:34,014 --> 01:19:36,214
God made them to keep us busy.

844
01:19:51,282 --> 01:19:53,112
everyone had enough to eat.

Hervé:
Then a letter arrived.

847
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,992
It took me five days
to open it.

848
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,519
It was stamped in Oostende,

849
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:10,115
but it had a Japanese seal
in the corner.

they opened the Suez Canal.

After that, a journey to Japan
would take twenty days,

A few days before her lilies bloomed.

packed one suitcase,

Baldabiou: I knew a man once who
built his own railroad.

And the beautiful thing is,

969
01:31:07,914 --> 01:31:10,134
he built it completely straight,

without a single curve.

971

He had a reason for that.

I've knocked on

It was you who wrote

It was not I who wrote it.

It was Helene.

Madame Blanche: She had already
written it when she came to see me.

She asked me to copy it out
in Japanese, and I did.

She read me that letter.

She read those words

01:33:49,946 --> 01:33:52,736
That I have
never been able to forget.

995
01:34:03,845 --> 01:34:07,345
Madame Blanche: I know
it's hard to understand...

996
01:34:08,338 --> 01:34:10,898
But I heard her read
that letter...

997
01:34:13,374 --> 01:34:15,124
and more than anything...

998
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,190
she wanted to be that woman.

999
01:34:22,528 --> 01:34:23,918
She was that woman.

1000
01:34:35,526 --> 01:34:36,966
Farewell.

1001
01:34:47,328 --> 01:34:48,378
[birds calling]

1002
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:55,390
Ludovic.

1003
01:34:56,150 --> 01:34:57,840
Ludovic:
Good day, sir.

1004
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:01,516
What are you doing here
on a Sunday?

1005
01:35:01,517 --> 01:35:02,806
You shouldn't work
on a Sunday.

1006
01:35:02,807 --> 01:35:04,804
I have a few things to finish,

1007
01:35:04,805 --> 01:35:06,615
Some trimming and weeding.

1008
01:35:07,509 --> 01:35:09,479
How was your trip to Paris?

1009
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,540
Fine. Thank you.

1010
01:35:19,617 --> 01:35:21,817
Would you like to sit with me?

1011
01:35:21,907 --> 01:35:23,357
Of course.

1012
01:35:42,671 --> 01:35:45,457
I think you like this place
as much as I do.

1013
01:35:45,458 --> 01:35:46,558
Very much, sir.

1014
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:52,749
In a way, I suppose
it's your garden, too.

1015
01:35:57,442 --> 01:35:59,813
Remember that little tree
I planted with Madame?

1016
01:35:59,814 --> 01:36:01,544
It's grown so tall now.

1017
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:07,580
I'm sorry, sir.

1018
01:36:10,258 --> 01:36:11,408
Don't be sorry.

1019
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:13,989
Silly.

1020
01:36:19,246 --> 01:36:21,696
Death is a strange thing,
Ludovic.

1021
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,329
Hervé: Strange.

1022
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:46,330
Hervé: But why should
I tell you about this?

1023
01:36:46,642 --> 01:36:48,072
Why now?

1024
01:36:50,246 --> 01:36:52,866
Maybe I just need
to tell someone...

1025
01:36:53,034 --> 01:36:54,474
and maybe it's you.

1026
01:36:56,571 --> 01:36:59,191
I guess it all began
when I came back home

1027
01:36:59,192 --> 01:37:02,682
on leave from the army,
when I first saw Helene.

1028
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:24,481
And now you know the real story.

1029
01:37:27,987 --> 01:37:29,547
Hervé: It's late now.

1030
01:37:30,484 --> 01:37:32,294
Finish your work tomorrow.

1031
01:37:52,745 --> 01:37:54,205
Helene: My beloved...

1032
01:37:56,074 --> 01:37:57,344
do not be afraid.

1033
01:37:59,486 --> 01:38:00,466
Do not speak.

1034
01:38:03,564 --> 01:38:04,774
Stay as you are.

1035
01:38:04,854 --> 01:38:06,524
I'm here at your side.

1036
01:38:08,224 --> 01:38:09,374
Do you feel me?

1037
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:13,100
When I touch you
for the first time,

1038
01:38:13,593 --> 01:38:17,493
you will feel the warmth,
but you will not know where.

1039
01:38:18,086 --> 01:38:20,526
Perhaps,
it will be on your eyes.

1040
01:38:23,204 --> 01:38:25,594
Who could ever erase
this moment?

1041
01:38:27,074 --> 01:38:29,904
There is no end to it,
don't you see?

1042
01:38:33,773 --> 01:38:36,519
What we were meant to do,
we have done.

1043
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:39,780
Believe me, my love,
we have done it forever.

1044
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:45,300
And if it serves your happiness,
do not hesitate for a moment

1045
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:48,192
to forget this woman,
who now says,

1046
01:38:49,627 --> 01:38:51,607
without a trace of regret...

1047
01:38:53,961 --> 01:38:55,301
Farewell.
