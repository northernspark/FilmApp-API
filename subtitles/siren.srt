00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,364
Sheriff Boone.

3
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,003
They said you were the one to call.

4
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,122
What are they? Cultists?

5
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,400
Satanists?

6
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,700
Amateurs.

7
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,886
Sheriff, I need your light.

8
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,129
What are you doing?

9
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,328
No wonder this didn't work.

10
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,731
What didn't work?

11
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:22,237
Well, they summoned something,
but they couldn't hold it.

12
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,441
Light, Sheriff.

13
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,886
Light!

14
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:37,967
Well, that's not good.

15
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,037
Who are you?

16
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,397
It's all right.

17
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,432
It's all right.

18
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,376
Come here.

19
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,947
Oh.

20
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,483
Well, you are something special.

21
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,824
Those idiots didn't know
what to do with you, did they?

22
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,824
That's all right.

23
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,258
It's okay.

24
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:12,956
I know all about you.

25
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,557
I know where you're from.

26
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,596
I know what you need.

27
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,132
May I show you something?

28
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,800
Don't be scared.

29
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,170
Here.

30
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,310
A pretty crown for a pretty princess.

31
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,175
Hmm?

32
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,321
I want to help you

33
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:45,920
because you are perfect.

34
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,059
There.

35
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,802
Now we can be friends.

36
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,790
Tell me what you want.

37
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,160
- You know what I want.
- Say it.

38
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,236
Look at me.

39
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,864
Look at me, slut.

40
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,707
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

41
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
- It's fine. Whatever.
- Oh, no. God.

42
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,742
- I'm sorry, no.
- No, no, no. Hey.

43
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,836
Hey, it's cool, it's fine.

44
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,745
- No...
- "Slut" is cool. Slut, I can do slut...

45
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,816
- Slut.
- Okay, ready?

46
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,884
I don't know. Okay.

47
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:41,951
Take two.

48
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,076
Okay.

49
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,452
No, no, no.

50
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,027
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

51
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,254
Just... It's like...

52
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,456
Like, this is why
we can't role play, you know?

53
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,861
'Cause, like, am I supposed to be me

54
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:55,989
- or am I supposed to be...
- Yeah, you're you.

55
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,365
And you're like a slut, right?

56
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,700
No, right?

57
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,069
Sorry, I don't know.

58
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,235
God, can't we just be Jonah and Eva?

59
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,536
- Eva's who I want.
- I know.

60
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,843
I just wanted to make sure
you remember that this weekend.

61
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,940
I will. Of course I will.

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,420
You know I want you to have fun,
I do, and strippers are one thing...

63
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,784
Who said anything about strippers?

64
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,084
I did and I say they're fine.

65
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,350
Get some ones, some fives, put a few
girls through college, everybody wins.

66
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,157
Just stay away from the seedy dives, yeah.

67
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,526
The seedy dives?

68
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,759
You know, the ones where the girls
don't really want to be there.

69
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,837
Oh, God. Eva, no,
I'm not into that kind of stuff.

70
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,098
- You know me.
- I do.

71
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,605
I also know your brother.

72
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,138
Heads up, pussies!

73
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,076
We gotta lay down
some ground rules, all right?

74
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:47,914
Rule number one, no texting
or calling girlfriends slash fiancées

75
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,420
once we make landfall, all right?
This is dude time.

76
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,185
We don't want anything
getting back to the bride-to-be.

77
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,954
All right? I've seen that shit
happen and it's brutal.

78
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,221
Yo, ear buds out.

79
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,557
- Oh, what's up?
- Come on, man.

80
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,693
All right, matter of fact,
everyone give me their cell phones.

81
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,325
All right?

82
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,765
- Hey, watch the road.
- I got it, I got it, relax.

83
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,896
- Please don't kill me.
- Relax, all right?

84
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:12,465
I don't want you guys sending out
any damn tweets,

85
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,076
get my main man in trouble over here
while he's trying to get his freak on.

86
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,512
All right, rule number two.

87
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,850
We say "yes".

88
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,619
We don't say "maybe", we don't say,
"Gee, I don't know. I've never..."

89
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,184
And we damn sure don't say "no".

90
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,090
We say "yes" to living

91
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,527
and "yes" to living it up!

92
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,756
Do you feel me?

93
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,831
- Yes!
- Yes!

94
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,298
"Gee, I don't know, I've never..."

95
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,463
- That's it.
- Whatever happened to Vegas?

96
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,867
Vegas is shit, man. It's hot as balls
and it smells like hot balls.

97
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,739
Trust me. Garden City is where we want to be.

98
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,311
See that? That's the spot.

99
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,507
The hottest place on the East Coast, baby!

100
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,776
Let's light this up!

101
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,712
Woo-hoo!

102
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,654
This place sucks.

103
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,188
Uh, no, it's... It's okay.

104
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,283
She's wearing flip-flops.

105
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,196
I almost forgot.

106
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,765
- I got some groomsmen's gifts for you guys.
- What?

107
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,664
- Thanks for coming.
- Such a Boy Scout.

108
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:11,757
Love you.

109
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,667
Classic Jonah. Always prepared.

110
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,130
- Oh, cool, you hate 'em.
- No, we don't.

111
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,230
- Yeah, you do.
- No.

112
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,904
No, you never know when you need
to open a tiny bottle of beer.

113
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,242
Stop. You know what?
We love them. Thank you, Jonah.

114
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,440
Don't we?

115
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,675
I love it, Jonah.

116
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,247
Let's drink till they're hot.

117
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,890
I know, man. It should've been you.

118
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,327
What? No.

119
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,056
Hey, look,
I wouldn't want the responsibility.

120
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,655
No, I want you to have it, man.

121
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,961
You are my best man.

122
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,091
You are.

123
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,329
See, like, this is the difference, like,

124
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,666
when I tell you that I had
to pick Mac over you, you get it,

125
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,640
but if I were to tell him, like,
"I'm picking you over my brother,"

126
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,267
he'd just never let it go.

127
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,245
Look, it's fine. Who cares?
How are you feeling?

128
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,439
You ready for next week?

129
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,141
Oh, yeah. I feel great.

130
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,616
I mean, I'm not nervous,
but then that kind of makes me nervous,

131
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,777
you know what I mean? Does that make sense?

132
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,218
It's gonna be fine, buddy.

133
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,288
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,448
- Hey, big boy.
- Hi.

135
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,288
- How about a dance?
- Oh. You know what? He would love one.

136
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,656
I got it.

137
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,888
- Okay.
- Enjoy, my man.

138
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,157
Thank you. Oh, here?

139
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,200
Yeah, it's just kind of like
I'm not really feeling anything right now,

140
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,203
but I feel like I should be
feeling something, you know?

141
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,568
I guess so. Yeah.

142
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,232
Like, what if I'm actually really nervous,

143
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,236
but I put, like, all my emotions on mute
or something just so I can get through it,

144
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,405
and I wake up in like a year or a month
or something and I realize

145
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,141
that I'm trapped
and I just totally freak out?

146
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,445
No way, man. Eva is awesome.

147
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,575
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be great.

148
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,645
- Yeah.
- You two are perfect for each other.

149
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,620
- She's the best.
- It's... Yeah, it's disgusting.

150
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:40,816
Yeah, I love her.

151
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:41,889
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

152
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,018
It's alcohol abuse, dude. Don't spill it.

153
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,863
Yo, brother, it's declined.

154
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,268
All right.

155
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,801
Use that one.

156
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,533
I'll take another one.

157
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,375
Bullshit, isn't it?

158
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,175
- Excuse me?
- The club.

159
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,309
I can read it on your face.

160
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,546
Yeah? Well, stop reading my face.

161
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,584
Sorry. It's just...

162
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,784
You hear all these stories about Garden City,

163
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,885
it's supposed to be
the greatest underground party scene.

164
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,193
Well, there's nothing here
I couldn't see in Tampa.

165
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:27,065
My baby brother's getting married next week
and I'm the best man, and I have to deliver.

166
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,132
I hear ya.

167
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,606
Look, I know a place.

168
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,305
I'm talking... A place.

169
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,214
This thing is dripping with pussy,
the music's amazing.

170
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,307
The vibe.

171
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,614
Makes this place
look like fucking Sunday school.

172
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,614
I can probably get you in.

173
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,454
But only if you and your boys are serious.

174
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:59,333
Or you can stay here, drink
that bottle, go home and pass out,

175
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:04,670
and in your drunken dreams,
maybe come close to the things I've seen.

176
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,108
A toast to Jonah.

177
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,809
All right? Man of the hour,
and lamb for the slaughter.

178
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:19,253
He's younger than me, he's less
handsome, much thinner penis...

179
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,323
That's not true.

180
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,483
- Don't interrupt.
- It's not.

181
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,191
But in spite of all that,
you're moving on up, man.

182
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,857
And you're marrying up. God, she's got money.

183
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,193
You're surpassing me, bro.

184
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:37,605
You're making an honest woman
out of Eva, and a man out of yourself.

185
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,908
Cheers.

186
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,878
Mmm.

187
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,746
Thank you, bro.

188
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,078
Yes, sir.

189
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,413
And that concludes opening ceremonies.

190
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,578
What?

191
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,654
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

192
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,414
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No.

193
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,486
Here you go. That's for you.

194
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,685
- Shrooms.
- Yup.

195
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,921
Like an old friend.

196
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,362
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

197
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,933
- Yup.
- Wow.

198
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,000
Mmm.

199
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,466
See this Wyatt Earp son of a bitch
over here at the end of the bar?

200
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,974
Says he can show us to the real Garden City.

201
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,042
That guy?

202
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,509
There's this club, man.
It's very underground.

203
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,773
He's going there now
and he says we can follow him.

204
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:17,939
Uh, no.

205
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,139
We don't say "no".

206
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,911
Rule number two, no "no's".

207
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,845
Rule number four...

208
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,585
Always trust a dude with a dick duster
on his face like that, man.

209
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,215
It's a con.

210
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,316
- You think so?
- Yes.

211
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,417
Then we vote.

212
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,928
Look, if you guys came here
with a matching set of sack, all right,

213
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,591
and you came here to do
what you came here to do,

214
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,601
then you seize your destiny
and you show your support,

215
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,501
and you gobble that mushroom down
like a Mario Brother.

216
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,595
I already did mine.

217
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,837
- Rand's in. Yeah!
- I didn't say that. No.

218
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,739
Actually, I'm kind of tired.

219
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,506
What? You can be tired
when you're married and Eva's fat.

220
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,209
How about it, Duncan?

221
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,078
- I'm the designated driver.
- Hey, we'll cab it. Don't worry about it.

222
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,415
I'm not leaving my car here
in this shady-ass strip mall.

223
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,950
As long as we get there
in 30 minutes or so, we're fine.

224
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,353
All right.

225
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,687
I'm in.

226
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,762
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, nice.

227
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,828
Attaboy.

228
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,261
I think I took two.

229
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,663
Jonah! Jonah!

230
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,429
- Jonah! Jonah! Jonah!
- I've never shroomed!

231
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,526
- Really?
- Jonah!

232
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,837
Woo! Attaboy!

233
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,976
How far away is this place?

234
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,808
He said it's hard to tell sometimes.

235
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,112
"It's hard to tell"?

236
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,242
Why?

237
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,653
It moves.

238
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,324
The hell does that mean?

239
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,283
How are you holding up?
You got 10 minutes or so, man.

240
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,624
- See any colors yet?
- I see red...

241
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,098
Taillights. And that's it.
There's nothing else out here, man.

242
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,502
- Hey, man, this is a bad idea, man.
- Yeah, Mac.

243
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,162
Seriously, we should probably
just turn around.

244
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,996
Come on. Jonah is the man of the night.
I think we should listen to Jonah.

245
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,007
Jonah says, "Go." So let's go.

246
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,706
- He just said, "Turn around."
- Jonah said, "Go." I'm speaking for Jonah.

247
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:56,871
Jonah says, "Go." Let's go.

248
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,107
We don't even know where this place is.

249
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,808
- Really, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's turning.

250
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,009
- Follow him, follow him.
- Okay, okay.

251
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,017
Right there, right there, right there.

252
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,322
He's gonna kill us all out here
and it's gonna be your fault.

253
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,686
Just relax.

254
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,926
This guy has us on a dirt road, man.

255
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,999
Where the hell are we? I love it.

256
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,867
Well, we're out in the woods.
That's for certain.

257
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,033
Only good things happen in the woods.
Everybody knows that.

258
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,108
Arbor Day.

259
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,109
Arbor Day happens in the woods.

260
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,777
What is this guy doing?

261
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,247
Okay, now he just turned off.

262
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,340
He just turned off, man. Don't lose him.

263
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,612
- Shit.
- Oh, shit.

264
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,449
All right, dude.

265
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,020
Welcome to 50 North, 40 West.

266
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,724
Are you guys coming?

267
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,925
After you.

268
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,782
Brought you some new friends.

269
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,910
Boys, step inside.

270
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,745
Hey.

271
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,415
You all right, man?

272
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,822
I'm messed up, man.

273
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,094
This place is messed up.

274
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,520
Yeah, it is.

275
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:31,818
we have some first-timers
with us here tonight!

277
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,215
They're here for a very special occasion

278
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:39,558
and that calls
for some very special treatment.

279
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,598
Ladies and gentlemen, put your paws together.

280
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,465
Happy stag party!

281
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,536
Jonah!

282
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,135
Did you set this up?

283
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,940
Don't look at me, man.

284
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,012
No.

285
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,643
Look at me.

286
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,944
Gentlemen, welcome.

287
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,313
Thank you so much for coming.

288
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,820
I'm the proprietor and you can call me Nyx.

289
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:11,717
Coming up next, the lovely Miss Torin.

290
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,861
You boys

291
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,266
are with me.

292
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,043
So, Jonah, we have worlds
of experiences here.

293
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,978
What is your particular flavor of poison?

294
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,975
Um...

295
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,676
- Who's the best man?
- Here.

296
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,809
What's he want?

297
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,718
- Something wild.
- Mmm-hmm.

298
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,982
- And private.
- All right.

299
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,352
Yeah, but... But no sex.

300
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,262
No sex as in the act
or no sex as in no gender?

301
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,328
Uh...

302
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,164
The act.

303
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,557
He's getting married next week.

304
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:51,967
Got it.

305
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,897
I have just the thing.

306
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,899
Gentlemen, come right on in.

307
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,838
Make yourselves comfortable.

308
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,670
Well, money is no object.

309
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,476
Well, of course it is.

310
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,414
That's all it is.

311
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,215
And what are objects,
ultimately, but worthless?

312
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:15,921
But, what in this world has worth?

313
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,526
Experience!

314
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,196
Experience!

315
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,596
And experiences are what I deal in.

316
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,237
So, you're saying there's no charge.

317
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,931
Now, did I say that?

318
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,179
All right.

319
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,440
You ready to do this?

320
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,979
- Sure.
- All right!

321
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,448
Oh, no, no, no.

322
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,522
This is just for Jonah.

323
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,387
This is a private show.

324
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,161
The more men in the room,
the more diluted the experience.

325
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,394
Well, I don't know.

326
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,760
- What?
- I don't know. I don't know.

327
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,933
- Are you married yet?
- Mmm-mmm.

328
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,131
- Are you married?
- No.

329
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,569
Not yet, technically.

330
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,901
So do it for us.

331
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,974
Do it for me.

332
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,236
Yeah, what do you say?

333
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,277
They buy the ticket, you take the ride.

334
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,311
Hmm? Hmm?

335
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,683
Hold this for me.

336
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,649
Yeah.

337
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,725
Hey.

338
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,487
Keep your pants on?

339
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,653
Yeah.

340
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,664
You ready for a peek behind door number one?

341
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:32,692
And away we go.

342
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,598
Have fun.

343
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,471
Shit!

344
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,354
Can you see me?

345
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,812
Now we talk payment.

346
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,879
I want the fondest memory of your mother

347
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,450
from each of you.

348
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,358
All of you.

349
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,386
Now, you give me that,

350
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:10,092
and Jonah will have a night
he will never forget.

351
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,225
I'm sorry.

352
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:16,033
You want us to tell you about the best time
that we had with our mothers?

353
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,831
No. I want the memory of it.

354
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,935
Now, it won't take but a moment,

355
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,309
and the most beautiful part about it is,
is you won't even miss it.

356
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,679
You can't miss a memory
you can't even remember, now can you?

357
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,016
That's right.

358
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,149
Do we have a deal?

359
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,222
Deal.

360
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,514
Yeah, okay.

361
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,230
Sure.

362
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:47,593
All right, gentlemen, I'm gonna
need you all to look at your shoes.

363
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,728
Our what?

364
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,638
Look at your shoes.

365
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,102
What am I looking for?

366
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,915
Go on.

367
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:01,941
Look at your shoes.

368
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,982
Look down.

369
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,860
Look down

370
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,162
and think of mother.

371
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,001
And we're done.

372
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,375
- That's it?
- That's it!

373
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,376
Paid in full. Go on!

374
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,285
Go have a great evening!

375
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,924
Come on, get out of here! Scat.

376
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,458
Can I get a receipt or something?

377
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,118
Get the fuck out!

378
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,457
Okay.

379
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,637
I'm sorry. Am I supposed
to do something or...

380
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,745
My parents are asleep.

381
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,356
Eva.

382
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,281
Hit me. We are paid in full.

383
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,927
Okay? I want one of them
worm drinks right there.

384
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,287
It's a leech.

385
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,624
Leech drink.

386
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,395
You're not scaring me, okay?

387
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,972
If I don't like it, my funeral.

388
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,279
What do you call this?

389
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,055
Murder.

390
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,557
Hmm?

391
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,161
Cheers.

392
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,002
Nicely done, Duncan.

393
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,341
Whoa!

394
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,144
Hey, dude, you tatted up?

395
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,839
What?

396
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,441
No, I'm not tatted up.

397
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,512
No, right here.

398
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,813
Haven't seen that before.

399
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,785
Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.

400
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,547
You got one too.

401
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,593
Did you do this?

402
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,628
What's the matter? You don't remember?

403
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,315
Don't go.

404
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,450
Hello?

405
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,388
Did you say something?

406
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,133
Oh, shit.

407
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,304
Hi. Hi. Can you hear me?

408
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:02,344
Hey.

409
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,950
Are you... Are you okay in there?

410
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,817
Like, do...

411
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,950
Do they have you locked up? Can you get out?

412
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,223
I'm a little high.
This might be a stupid question.

413
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,030
Are you okay in there?

414
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,233
Where are you?

415
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,373
Shit.

416
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,658
Whoa!

417
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,550
Dude...

418
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,754
Shit.

419
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,230
I'm sorry.

420
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,958
- It's, it's cool.
- Yeah. It's fine.

421
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,031
Happens to the best of us, man.

422
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,895
- I didn't mean it.
- It's fine.

423
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,004
- Let's go.
- I didn't mean to.

424
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,368
Let's get, uh...
Let's get this cleaned up, dude.

425
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,446
Who was she?

426
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,039
Who was she?

427
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,979
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

428
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,454
Jesus.

429
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,546
Come on, man. Really?

430
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,319
Here, grab him and put him over here, man.

431
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,021
All right.

432
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,529
Shit.

433
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,140
Come on. Come on, let's get out, man.

434
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,470
- We have overstayed our welcome.
- I need you to come with me.

435
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,412
- What?
- Come with me.

436
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,541
What happened back there, man?

437
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,920
- Is he all right?
- Oh, he... He puked.

438
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,384
All right, take him to the car,
get it started, be ready to go.

439
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,688
- What?
- Just trust me.

440
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,193
What's going on?

441
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,425
I'm about to do something really stupid.

442
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:01,563
Are you sure you know where we're going?

443
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,933
Yeah, I counted the doors.

444
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,137
- Jonah. Jonah. What the hell is this place?
- Shh...

445
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,518
I wasn't even gonna come in, you know.

446
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,284
- Thought I'd go easy tonight.
- Shit.

447
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,518
When I bumped into those guys,
it was like it was meant to be, you know?

448
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,553
I think I got lucky there.

449
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,491
I get four.

450
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,031
Full house, right?

451
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,559
One for each of the boys I brought in.

452
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,962
New fish?

453
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,937
Hey, you be sure
to tell him thank you for me.

454
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,873
For letting me see my baby again.

455
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,111
Jonah. Jonah, what is going on?

456
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,309
- There's a girl.
- What?

457
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,113
In a booth. She's locked up.

458
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,212
No, locked in, so guys can get to her, right?

459
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,958
Look, come on, man. Elliot's sick
and I'm seeing some really weird shit.

460
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,283
- Give me your knife.
- Why?

461
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,918
- Just give it to me.
- Jonah, stop this.

462
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:03,088
This is like sex trafficking
or something. Yeah.

463
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,766
Man, of course, Mac would bring us
to a place with sex trafficking.

464
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,666
- You had sex with her?
- No.

465
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,737
Then what happened?

466
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,466
I don't know, really. She, uh... She sang.

467
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,168
- What?
- She sang, okay?

468
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,438
Just give me the knife.

469
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,377
It's ridiculous. What are they doing?

470
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:27,055
I killed her.

471
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,221
Who did you kill, buddy?

472
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,288
I don't know.

473
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,558
I don't know who she was.

474
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,831
She was young.

475
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,397
What did they put in that drink?

476
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,304
Our memories.

477
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,671
Two memories.

478
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,916
What if you're right?
What if it is sex traffickers, huh?

479
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,988
You know the type of people
you don't wanna mess with?

480
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,954
It's sex traffickers. That's who, Jonah.

481
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,559
They are going to know that it's you.
That Nyx guy, he'll know.

482
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,753
- We can't leave her here.
- Can't we make an anonymous phone call?

483
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,427
Look, I think she needs help, man.
Like, like, now and not later.

484
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,499
This is crazy.

485
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,500
Isn't that what tonight's about? Right?

486
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,798
It's like the last hurrah for crazy, right?

487
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,873
We say "yes," okay?

488
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,771
Tonight we say, "Yes."

489
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,172
Got it.

490
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,320
Yes. Hello, we're, um, here to rescue you.

491
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,398
- Hi.
- Okay.

492
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,458
Hey, you okay?

493
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,396
You want my shirt?

494
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,332
- Here you go.
- Jonah, come on.

495
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,841
- We need to leave.
- Hang on.

496
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,137
Here you go.

497
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,678
Take this.

498
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,076
Yeah, you're okay.

499
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,149
Yeah, yeah. There you go.

500
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,912
There you go.

501
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,151
You're fine. Yeah.

502
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,652
All right, hi.

503
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,850
My name's Jonah and this is Rand.

504
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,989
We can take you out of here if you wanna go.

505
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,358
Do you wanna go?

506
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,260
- You do? Okay.
- She wants to go. Come on.

507
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,231
Okay, come on. Let's go, please.

508
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,803
- Which way?
- I don't remember.

509
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,868
- I thought you said you counted the doors.
- It wasn't like this before.

510
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,470
There's someone back here, Jonah. Pick away.

511
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,843
I don't know.

512
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,644
She does.

513
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,081
Shit.

514
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,585
Hey. Hey!

515
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:23,444
Hey, hey. Hey, look, it's cool, man.
We're trying to find away out of here.

516
00:35:23,544 --> 00:35:25,674
Can you help us find a way out of here?

517
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,759
Look, look. You don't have to do this.

518
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,502
Take her, Jonah. Run!

519
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,036
Whoa, whoa, Rand. What are you...

520
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,369
Oh, my God.

521
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,646
Stop it, please. Please.

522
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,375
Stop it.

523
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,940
What are you... What are you doing?
Can't we worry about that later, please?

524
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,374
- Bind.
- What?

525
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,573
Bind.

526
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,220
What?

527
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,470
What is taking so long?

528
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,116
We should go back inside.

529
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,516
They said they'd meet us here.

530
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,954
Yeah, but I want another drink.

531
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,859
Open the door! Open it.

532
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,932
- Where's Rand?
- He was with you.

533
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,298
- We got separated.
- What the hell happened?

534
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,994
There was a girl in the back, she was
locked up, so we let her out, you know.

535
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,399
Thought she was there against her will.

536
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,983
Okay, we're out of here, man.

537
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,779
We gotta wait for Rand.

538
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,217
We gotta wait for Rand.
Mac, we gotta wait for Rand.

539
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,726
This is crap.

540
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,257
Wait, Mac.

541
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,058
There he is. There he is. There he is.

542
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,266
Get the hell out of here. Go, go, go, go.

543
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,665
Go. Go, go, go.

544
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,439
What the hell are you laughing about?

545
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,502
- What's he laughing at?
- Is that your blood?

546
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,345
This is fucked. This is fucked.

547
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,053
What the hell is going on?

548
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,122
- Where's the girl?
- I don't know.

549
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,690
She's not a girl, man. She's something else.

550
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,259
Like a transsexual?

551
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,026
- That could be cool.
- No!

552
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,027
Hey, hey. What do you mean something else?

553
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,194
Look out!

554
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,104
Is everyone okay?

555
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,576
Yeah. Shit.

556
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,113
Who's...

557
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,945
That's my jacket.

558
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,946
Hey, there's Elliot. Elliot?

559
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,384
Dude, he's alive.

560
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,454
Elliot!

561
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,554
Elliot!

562
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,164
- Shit.
- What the hell is that?

563
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,401
Oh, God. God. Fuck.

564
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:02,893
Shit.

565
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,097
There's a car coming.

566
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,141
- Get him, get him, get him.
- I'll flag him. I'll flag him.

567
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,404
Hey. Hey, help! Please stop.

568
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,706
Hey... Ahh!

569
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,779
Hey, wait!

570
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,108
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

571
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,207
They're coming back.

572
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,583
- Let's go.
- Everybody's dying.

573
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,518
Then let's not! Come on.

574
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,232
Damn it.

575
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,079
We're gonna need that boy now.

576
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:51,044
Luckily, we have something
that's his under the C-A-R.

577
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,483
Oh.

578
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,959
Well, hey there.

579
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,104
Oh, boy.

580
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,837
Wait, wait. Where are we going?

581
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,439
You don't know, either.

582
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,244
We're going this way, Mac, okay?

583
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,875
So I can get a signal on my phone
and I can call the police.

584
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,352
So I can tell them that two
of my friends are dead.

585
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,854
We don't know if that one guy
is actually dead.

586
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,050
"One guy"? His name is Rand, man.

587
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,182
Rand.

588
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,354
He's been my best friend for, like,
15 years and you don't even know his name.

589
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,488
Yeah, I do.

590
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,089
And Rand might not be dead.

591
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,599
Well, that one guy might not be dead. Wow.

592
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:47,940
I'm trying to help.

593
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,636
Oh. Oh, well, thank you, Mac.

594
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,110
Thank you so much for your help.

595
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,805
This has been so much fun.

596
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,248
Thank you for taking your dick out and
swinging it all over in front of everybody

597
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,980
and thanks for getting two
of my actual friends killed, too.

598
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,054
Thank you for that.

599
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,323
I didn't tell you to mess with anything.

600
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,553
And I didn't tell you to let
anyone out of any booth.

601
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,097
Wait, shut up.

602
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,799
What is that?

603
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,833
Run.

604
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:29,941
- Shit.
- Oh, God.

605
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,551
You okay?

606
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,523
- Come on.
- It smells like shit.

607
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,696
Hold on.

608
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,729
- It's quicksand.
- It's not quicksand.

609
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,462
- Well, I'm about to lose my shoe.
- Come on!

610
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,737
What does she want?

611
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,111
Me.

612
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,912
When I let her out of that booth she, like...

613
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,052
She, like, sniffed me.

614
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,786
That's why she took Elliot 'cause he's...
he's wearing my jacket.

615
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,950
Why don't you lose your clothes then?

616
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:11,549
- Come on, dude.
- Stop it!

617
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,590
It's not the first time I've seen your dick.

618
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,925
It's not the clothes, you dumb-ass.

619
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,499
The clothes smell like me.

620
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,366
Oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:27,441
Great idea.

622
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,509
Shit.

623
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,110
- Get down.
- Shit.

624
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:41,856
Shh...

625
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,271
Let's get back to the road.

626
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,075
If we follow it, we can find some place.

627
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,377
How's your ankle? Can you walk?

628
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,948
No. But I can run.

629
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,661
Oh, shit. Hold on.

630
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,578
Who are you?

631
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,515
What... What?

632
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,915
Who are you?

633
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,414
I'm Rand.

634
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,191
Wilson. Rand Wilson.

635
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,491
Who are you, Rand Wilson?

636
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,029
I'm... I'm nobody...

637
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,631
No, that's who you're going to be
if you don't answer my questions.

638
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,669
What do you want with the Lilith, hmm?

639
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:35,862
Who are you?

640
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,166
Is it that little prick shaman
down in Panama City?

641
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,297
- No.
- Was it him?

642
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,535
No. I don't know anything about that, okay?

643
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,374
I told you. It was...
It was our friend, Jonah.

644
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:47,045
Yeah, it was...
It was his bachelor party. Yeah.

645
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,549
And the man... And the man there,
he brought us here.

646
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,846
We followed him...

647
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:55,346
You bought it all with good memories,
so your friend Jonah could spend some time

648
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,356
with one of my star attractions.

649
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:58,425
That's great.

650
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,257
So why did he let her go?

651
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:03,330
I don't know. I don't know, okay?

652
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,333
I don't. He thought you
had her locked up in there.

653
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:11,267
Oh, I did have her locked up in there for
some very good reasons, as you have seen.

654
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,384
Oh, thank God.

655
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,881
- Hey, you okay, son?
- No. No.

656
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,457
- I'm not okay, officers.
- All right, sit down.

657
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:30,752
- Sit, sit. Please.
- No.

658
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,318
His friends... Our friends are dead.

659
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,897
I'm afraid, there's someone following us.

660
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,932
Hold on now. Who is following you?

661
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,364
Shit, shit.

662
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,834
We went to this club in the swamp.

663
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,769
And... It's... it's 50-something.

664
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,239
This guy...

665
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,469
Hey, why don't you get these boys some water?

666
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,902
- All right, just catch your breath. Breathe.
- Ma'am, get some water for these boys.

667
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,379
- All right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

668
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,510
And the check too, please.

669
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,753
- We're busy.
- Found 'em.

670
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,891
Couple of cops picked 'em up
at a diner on the edge of town.

671
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,896
Well, what do you know about that?

672
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,838
Take 'em into the church,
make everything ready.

673
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,839
- So that's really it, huh?
- Yes.

674
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,207
That's all of it?

675
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,679
Just some failed knight in shining armor bit?

676
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,646
Yes, I swear... I swear to God,
that's it. That's it, yes.

677
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,021
Well, that does make things easier.

678
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,483
No. God. Please, wait. Wait.
Please, don't. Please, don't.

679
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,718
- Please, don't.
- I wouldn't move if I was you.

680
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:45,896
Now, you know, I think you owe
my associate, Barry, here an apology.

681
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,260
Because of your friend's thoughtless
actions he now has a very deep

682
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,270
personal family tragedy to deal with.

683
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,635
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

684
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:54,969
- Tell him!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

685
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:58,906
Please. I just... I wanna leave.
I wanna go home. I'm so sorry.

686
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:02,742
We both know your brother is irreplaceable.

687
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,453
Don't blame the Lilith.

688
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,650
- Blame them.
- No, no, no, please.

689
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:09,485
No. I said, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

690
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,217
- I'm sorry. Please. I wanna go home.
- Shh.

691
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,486
What is he doing? What are you doing?

692
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,756
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Well, um...

693
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:17,832
He's gonna hurt you for a while
and I'm gonna watch.

694
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,662
I told you everything I know, okay?

695
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,758
I believe you. I believe you. I know.

696
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,596
God! Please, no.

697
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,799
Please, please. Please stop. Please stop.

698
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,971
But you boys stuck your hand
in the fire tonight

699
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:32,639
and it is my right to see you get burned.

700
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:34,409
Why? Why?

701
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,983
Why?

702
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,749
'Cause you messed
with the wrong motherfucker.

703
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:39,820
No!

704
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,661
But she took off into the woods.
I don't know where she went.

705
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,561
Oh, but you guys got away.

706
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,296
Yeah. We followed the road.

707
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,703
- This is the first place that we saw.
- All right, you boys on something?

708
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,000
- No. No. We absolutely are not.
- Yes, yes.

709
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:01,175
Please take me to the station.
Just get me out of here, please.

710
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:05,974
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jonah.
Come on, man. Come... No, come on.

711
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,343
- They said take him to the church.
- Wait, who said that?

712
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,652
Who said that? Wait.

713
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,343
What the...

714
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:15,848
They work for him.

715
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,157
Up.

716
00:50:19,398 --> 00:50:20,805
Hey.

717
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:25,923
- Go.
- No.

718
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:27,234
No.

719
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,595
I like you.

720
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,630
Mac?

721
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,065
Mac?

722
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,057
Holy shit.

723
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,116
Stop. No. Please.

724
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,454
Eva.

725
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,524
Eva.

726
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:04,963
Jonah.

727
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,413
Wow. You guys really did a number on him.

728
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:14,574
I want all of it.

729
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:20,649
Every blow, every scream,
every drop of piss in his pants.

730
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:24,392
Let's give Jonah something
to really think about, hmm?

731
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,588
You got it.

732
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,362
Rand...

733
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,301
Look down.

734
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,704
Now bear with us.

735
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:48,841
In a moment,
you won't even recall the worst of it.

736
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,122
Got it.

737
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,316
See that he gets it.

738
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,783
Don't leave until you're sure he has.

739
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,256
Eva.

740
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,124
Shit, I shouldn't have called.
I interrupted your party.

741
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,253
No, no, no.

742
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,457
I actually really need
to hear your voice right now.

743
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,395
Are you okay?

744
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,130
Um, yeah. It's stupid. I just...

745
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,367
I had this dream
that I couldn't find you and then...

746
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,601
When I woke up,
you weren't here and I even got up

747
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,041
and went to look for you in the kitchen.

748
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:27,539
Don't know, then I just got
this bad feeling like...

749
00:58:27,636 --> 00:58:29,173
Like I needed to talk to you.

750
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:31,218
I really wanna talk to you right now too.

751
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,580
I don't know if I, uh, if I can right now.

752
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,418
Jonah, Jonah.

753
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,017
Hello? Eva?

754
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:40,892
Can you...

755
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,931
Listen, listen. Uh, something happened. Um...

756
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,333
Elliot...

757
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,958
He's dead and...

758
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,798
- And Rand, he's...
- Are you there?

759
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,164
- Hello?
- Damn it.

760
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,135
Eva, Eva, listen to me.

761
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,006
Uh, listen. I don't know if you can hear me.

762
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,204
But, um...

763
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:02,313
My phone's about to die
and I just wanna tell you that I love you.

764
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,782
I love you so much.

765
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,546
That's scary. What did you do?

766
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:07,752
Nothing. No.

767
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,253
I just...

768
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,655
Really wanted to say it.

769
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:19,133
There's no place in the world I'd rather be
than home with you right now.

770
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:21,460
- Yeah.
- Are you there?

771
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,395
Hello?

772
01:00:38,884 --> 01:00:40,693
Rough night?

773
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,948
Get the hell out of here.

774
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,945
Brought you a drink.

775
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,382
- I'm not thirsty.
- I'm not patient.

776
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:53,584
I was supposed to be off work two hours ago.

777
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,863
So you gonna drink that or not?

778
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,133
Because if not...

779
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,530
I'm supposed to kill you.

780
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,361
Okay, okay.

781
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:08,799
Right.

782
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:22,989
Good boy.

783
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,229
'Cause you messed
with the wrong motherfucker.

784
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,398
No, wait. Please.

785
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:48,743
Jonah, are you...

786
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,378
There you are.

787
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,508
Hi, Jonah.

788
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,211
Well, as you can feel, or

789
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:57,247
remember feeling, I've obviously
put Rand into a great deal of pain.

790
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,952
Now, he's not dead. Not yet.
But that can change.

791
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:01,928
And will.

792
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:03,556
If we can't make a deal.

793
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,300
So, you have my girl and I,
obviously, have your man.

794
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,463
So, let's make a trade. Hmm?

795
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,370
No games, no tricks.

796
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,602
Everybody can walk away with what they want.

797
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,613
My associate will give you
all the details and, uh...

798
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,309
I'll be seeing you soon.

799
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,742
Toodle-oo.

800
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,858
He wants to make a trade.

801
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,354
It's your choice, man.
I'm just the messenger.

802
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,096
But that girl, I don't have her.
She's not with me.

803
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,395
She's following you.

804
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,528
Taking you to him is as good as taking her.

805
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:54,207
Then take me to him.

806
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:57,443
Yes, sir.

807
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,140
Tick tock, Jonah.

808
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:30,809
Your old friend's inside and I don't wanna
be here when the new one shows up.

809
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:40,216
My, my!

810
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,223
Hell is empty and the devils are all here.

811
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,624
You look horrible.

812
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,300
Where's Rand?

813
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,537
No hello, no nothing. Rude.

814
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,502
Come on. I'll take you to him.

815
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,941
So she didn't catch you?

816
01:04:00,735 --> 01:04:02,372
She did.

817
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,446
Well, you don't look too worse for wear.
That's something.

818
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,286
I mean, she likes you.

819
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,453
Thing is, you've been chosen.

820
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,758
You know they mate for life.

821
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:14,892
We'll use that.

822
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,396
You didn't have to hurt Rand,
you could've just brought me here.

823
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:20,399
No, I didn't have to.
I was willing to and I did.

824
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:24,501
Don't forget that.
Just... do what you're told, Jonah.

825
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,367
And you'll be banging away
at Mrs. Jonah by suppertime tomorrow.

826
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,072
Defy me

827
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:33,508
and your boy Rand

828
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:37,275
gets a bullet in the brain
he'll be thinking about forever.

829
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,415
What is this?

830
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,520
Think of it like a shock collar for dogs.

831
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:48,891
Except for her kind.

832
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:52,626
Helps prevent incidents like
this evening. Keeps her in line,

833
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,498
makes her more susceptible to suggestion.

834
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,264
No, no, no, no. That's for you.

835
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:58,838
You're going to put it on her.

836
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:03,973
- Me?
- Yes, you.

837
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,278
Why do you think I brought you here?

838
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,608
She and I have a...

839
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:12,175
complicated history.

840
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:17,290
Besides, you're probably the only one
she trusts enough to let get close.

841
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:20,660
Magic?

842
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,389
Sure.

843
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,191
Magic.

844
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:30,400
Like everything else, people like you
will just never understand.

845
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,940
Now, when our little transaction is complete,

846
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,969
you and, uh, Mr. Gimpy are free to go.

847
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,348
Don't worry. Won't be long.

848
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,548
Rand. God. Rand.

849
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:54,055
Are you all right?
I'm so sorry, Rand. I'm so sorry.

850
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:56,861
They did this to you...

851
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,432
What'd they do?

852
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,499
Wha...

853
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:01,993
What's up?

854
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,092
- What did you say?
- Jonah.

855
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,170
What?

856
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,066
What did they do to me?

857
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:11,837
Listen to me.

858
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,713
I'm going home to Eva
and I'm taking you with me.

859
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:17,784
All right?

860
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:18,851
Hmm.

861
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,515
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

862
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,073
Rand?

863
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,147
Jonah, are you okay?

864
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,025
Help me, Joey.

865
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,796
Lily!

866
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:19,702
So pretty!

867
01:07:20,452 --> 01:07:22,227
Come on, Lily.

868
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,841
Stand in the center. Come on.

869
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:28,449
Come on, Lily, it's time to go.

870
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,024
Lily,

871
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,157
stand in the center.

872
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,320
Or he dies.

873
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,396
Come on, now. That's right.

874
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:42,158
There we go.

875
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:44,003
Good.

876
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,398
You were much younger then.

877
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,811
You've made it a lot easier. You're up.

878
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,235
I'm sorry.

879
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,298
I'm sorry.

880
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,603
You came here for me and...

881
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:24,677
It was a trap.

882
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,307
I didn't know

883
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:30,106
what you were.

884
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,712
What he was.

885
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:38,852
I just want to go home.

886
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:44,330
Do you?

887
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,957
She's a killer, Jonah. You know that.

888
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,567
Now put her back where she belongs.

889
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,695
She belongs to me.

890
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,631
Do it. Now.

891
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:56,466
How about we go home?

892
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,204
Both of us.

893
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,247
To our own homes.

894
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,145
And we just leave it at that.

895
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,447
You're wasting time.

896
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:09,822
Do it.

897
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,285
Do it now!

898
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:14,927
Okay?

899
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,088
You...

900
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,325
are on my very last nerve, you know that?

901
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,587
We are gonna try this one more time.

902
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:53,328
Good to see you, shit tits.

903
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:57,603
Get the fuck out of here.

904
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,399
- You all right?
- Yeah.

905
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,377
Here, take this.

906
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,771
Okay.

907
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,142
Cut Rand loose.

908
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:12,051
Come here.

909
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:14,982
Come here. Come on. Come on.

910
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:00,859
You circus freak.

911
01:11:01,923 --> 01:11:02,893
What?

912
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,604
You... piece of shit.

913
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:06,866
Atta girl.

914
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,245
Come on, Jonah.

915
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:21,387
Huh.

916
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:22,980
Don't go anywhere.

917
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:28,419
Jonah, run!

918
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:33,759
No!

919
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,249
Rand, cover your ears.

920
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:51,579
Cover your ears!

921
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,105
Please.

922
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,812
- Shit, Jonah.
- It's okay. It's okay.

923
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:01,887
It's okay.

924
01:13:03,495 --> 01:13:05,201
It's okay.

925
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:26,971
Thank you.

926
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:39,283
Don't go.

927
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,061
Shit.

928
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:43,529
Oh, no.

929
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,165
Jonah!

930
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,097
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Hold on, Jonah. Just leave.

931
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,298
Jonah.

932
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,040
Honey!

933
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:14,083
Let's get this special night started.
I'm sleepy.

934
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,690
Some of us had to wake up at 6:00.

935
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:40,905
Happy anniversary.

936
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,423
Eva.

937
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,487
When did you come down here?

938
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,092
Hey!

939
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:46,970
What the hell! What are you doing here?

940
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,374
That... That's Eva.

941
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,480
My wife.

942
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:59,350
You can't be here.

943
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,395
You can't be here.

944
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:04,314
You gotta go.

945
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,391
Okay?

946
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,284
Go.

947
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:10,663
Okay? Okay.

948
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,004
No!

949
01:18:19,386 --> 01:18:22,470
Get off her, please! I'll go!

950
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,369
I'll go.

951
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,809
Please, just don't hurt her.

952
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:26,936
I'll go.

953
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,605
I'll go.

954
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,888
Jonah!

955
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,462
No!

956
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,401
Jonah!

956
01:18:51,305 --> 01:18:57,458
