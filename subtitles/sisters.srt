00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,220
You scored yourself
a nice corner. Good job.

3
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:57,390
Hi. I'm Maura Ellis.

4
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,492
I'm not part of a religious
group or anything.

5
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:02,862
I'm just a nurse who likes to
give back on her days off.

6
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,363
You know, when you're
living outdoors,

7
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:07,166
skin cancer
is a real concern.

8
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,813
So I got you
some sunscreen,

9
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:11,269
and you, my friend,
have some irregular moles.

10
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:13,171
You're a very
friendly person.

11
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:15,674
Wanna come to my house
and take a shower?

12
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:16,741
Maybe make
a list of goals?

13
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:18,544
I have a girlfriend.

14
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:20,579
Great. It's important to have a
lady out there in the street.

15
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:23,248
What do you call it,
a road bitch or something?

16
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:24,382
Her name's Karen.

17
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:26,451
Your little mama?
Your street wife?

18
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:27,620
Anyway,

19
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:29,121
I'm pretty good
with sayings,

20
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:33,593
so I make these cards for my sister,
but I think maybe you could use one.

21
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,829
Without the dark night, we would
never see the bright stars.

22
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:38,131
<i>Is this from Twilight?</i>

23
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,198
No, I made it up.

24
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,599
No, you didn't.

25
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:41,667
Yeah, I did.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,802
See you later.

27
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:44,637
Wait.

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,204
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:47,439
Hey!

30
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:48,875
You're not homeless?

31
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,308
You were on a roll.

32
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:51,710
Well, give me back
the sunscreen

33
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:53,712
so I can give it
to an actual homeless person!

34
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:54,881
Like this lady.

35
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,650
Fuck off!
I'm the manager here.

36
00:01:58,617 --> 00:01:59,786
0 for 2.

37
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,525
Polenta!
Come get your dinner.

38
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,229
Mom?

39
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:11,430
Hi. Can you hear me?

40
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:13,632
<i>Hiya, kid.
What are you up to today?</i>

41
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:16,335
Dad, come in front of the
camera so I can see you.

42
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,236
<i>How are things
at the hospital, honey?</i>

43
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,273
<i>We heard that Atlanta
had a terrible storm.</i>

44
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,507
<i>-Garage sale.
-Okay.</i>

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,243
Can you guys both sit in front
of the camera when you talk

46
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,445
so that I can see you and
hear you at the same time?

47
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,749
<i>-We don't get this Skype crap.
-There's nothing to get.</i>

48
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,517
<i>-You're doing it.
-Maura,</i>

49
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,286
<i>We have some news.</i>

50
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:34,887
<i>Maura, we have some news.</i>

51
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:37,790
My God. Who's sick?

52
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,858
<i>For cry-eye, Maura.</i>

53
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,459
<i>Relax!</i>

54
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:43,228
<i>We decided</i>

55
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,400
<i>to sell the house.</i>

56
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,669
Yeah, okay. Funny joke.
What's the news?

57
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,337
<i>We are.
We're selling it.</i>

58
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:53,806
The one we grew up in?

59
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:54,907
Are you selling it
to each other?

60
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,375
<i>No, honey.</i>

61
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:57,575
Why would you do that?

62
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:58,743
<i>We don't
want it anymore.</i>

63
00:02:58,776 --> 00:02:59,811
<i>-It's too big.
-Look, if this is some kind</i>

64
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:02,480
Of financial thing, I can
help you out with money.

65
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,082
<i>No, honey.</i>

66
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:07,220
<i>All we need you to do is to
come and clean out your bedroom</i>

67
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:08,487
<i>because it's
a bottomless pit.</i>

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,690
Okay. I can come. Just don't
make a move until I get there.

69
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:13,491
Does Kate know about this?

70
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,294
<i>We haven't
told her yet.</i>

71
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,629
<i>You two take news
so differently.</i>

72
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,566
<i>We wondered if maybe</i>

73
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:21,501
<i>you should tell her.</i>

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,402
<i>Because we don't want to.</i>

75
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,796
Why do I always
have to be the one?

76
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:28,507
Shit.

77
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,842
I think you guys froze.
Hold on. Can you hear me?

78
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,412
Hello?

79
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:35,680
You're blinking.
You're fake freezing.

80
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,850
Unbelievable. Just call her.
You're her parents.

81
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,457
Dad! Let it go.

82
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:56,269
See, where most stylists blow
it is they color your hair

83
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:58,638
but they leave
your Santa eyebrows.

84
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,705
They half-ass it,
but I'm a perfectionist.

85
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,008
Thank you.

86
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,943
So why are we covering
this gray today, Phil?

87
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:09,515
Well, I have a date with an engaging
new gal, somewhat younger than me.

88
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,817
Good for you, because ladies
your age are gross, right?

89
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,954
Well, I just hope it looks natural.
It smells very strong.

90
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:17,589
No. It's super gentle.
They use it on pageant babies.

91
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:18,990
Mom! I'm home!

92
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:23,028
My daughter's home! She has
been gone half the summer.

93
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,662
I'll be right back. If it feels
like it's burning, it's working.

94
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,002
Wow!

95
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:33,873
You have been gone for so long!
Did you get taller?

96
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,546
I've only been gone a month, and I
stopped growing a long time ago.

97
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,310
Is this supposed
to be getting warm?

98
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:39,344
Let it cook, Phil.

99
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,781
Mom?

100
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:44,854
Why are you doing some guy's
hair in the bathroom?

101
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:47,385
P.S. this does not
feel right. Hello.

102
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,790
Why aren't you
doing it in a salon?

103
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:52,024
Please don't tell me
you quit your job again.

104
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,826
I didn't quit! All right.

105
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:55,760
You know that dipshit lady
on Channel Eleven

106
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:57,729
who does the segments
where she tries new things?

107
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:58,897
Yeah. Go on.

108
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,031
Well, she wanted bangs,

109
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:02,668
but then afterwards she decided
that she didn't want bangs.

110
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:04,537
And my manager
started bitching me out,

111
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:07,038
so I shoved him and his American
Girl Doll glasses broke.

112
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,507
Okay. So you got fired.

113
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,410
Why do you keep
doing this, Mom?

114
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:12,810
You wanna have
a cereal party?

115
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,716
No, I don't. I want you to be
responsible so that I don't have to be.

116
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,084
It is too stressful

117
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,620
sleeping with you on a pull-out
couch in your friend's dining room.

118
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:23,556
She is not my friend.
She was our bug man.

119
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,958
I need to learn
to be more irresponsible

120
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,427
otherwise I'm going to be
hazed so bad in college.

121
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:30,496
It's bubbling
like Pop Rocks.

122
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:31,796
-I'm gonna stay at Annie's house again.
-All right.

123
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:35,500
Okay, that's a lie because Annie
is in Italy with her family.

124
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,836
I know how
to use Facebook.

125
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,739
I will keep sending you pictures
so that you know that I'm safe.

126
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:41,841
No. You cannot just leave again
and not tell me where you are.

127
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,110
You know why I don't tell
you where I'm going?

128
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:47,078
Because you'll show up there and you'll
make a big scene like a hothead!

129
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,849
I am not a hothead!
I am brassy.

130
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,151
I love you, Mom, but your life
is just too chaotic right now.

131
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,620
-It is not chaotic.
-Kate!

132
00:05:56,988 --> 00:05:58,490
Is this your waxing strip?

133
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,725
I don't know, Dana.
It must be a client's.

134
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,461
My dog had this
in his feces.

135
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:04,930
And before
I could stop him

136
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:08,634
he ate the poop with the
waxing strip in it again.

137
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,835
-And then he threw that up.
-Okay.

138
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,639
You know how many times a day
I kiss that dog on the mouth?

139
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:15,107
An unsettling amount.

140
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,142
Now when I kiss him,

141
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:19,478
I'm gonna picture
that he ate

142
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:22,715
some stranger's pubes.

143
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,949
And it's gonna affect
my relationship with him.

144
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:26,519
Boy.

145
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,787
All right. Let's bring this
in for a landing, Dana.

146
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,622
You get out of here
by tomorrow.

147
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:31,022
You're done!

148
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,526
Where the hell
am I gonna go?

149
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,728
You wanna explain that
to my daughter?

150
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,129
Haley?

151
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,497
Shit.

152
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:41,466
Haley?

153
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,601
Haley!

154
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,506
Okay, Haley, just come back up,
and we will talk about this.

155
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:48,640
Hey, it's me.

156
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:51,443
Hello? This is very
unprofessional.

157
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,044
Hey. I can't talk right now.

158
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:54,512
Real quick.
Mom and Dad called.

159
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:55,848
What now?

160
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,715
What's up?
Everything all right?

161
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:00,920
No, I don't need lotion
in there.

162
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,554
Yeah, you do need lotion
in there.

163
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,490
Hey, here's something fun.

164
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,725
Mom and Dad
want us to come down.

165
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:09,461
<i>They need us to clear out
some of our old bedroom stuff.</i>

166
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,163
Why? They have other rooms.

167
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,866
<i>I don't know. Maybe they
wanna get a treadmill.</i>

168
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,869
A treadmill?
Mom can't even sit right on a couch.

169
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,108
-I'm just gonna shape them real quick.
-All right.

170
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:26,078
Yeah, no. I can't afford to
come to Orlando right now.

171
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,046
Well, I'll send you money
for the flight.

172
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,683
Come to Orlando.
Ellis sisters reunion.

173
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:35,187
<i>Coming home always makes
things better.</i>

174
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,089
That's actually
a really good idea.

175
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,992
Tell me the truth.

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,931
<i>Next stop, Orlando Airport.
Thank you for riding Greyhound.</i>

177
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,872
<i>Please maintain contact
with your baggage.</i>

178
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:54,744
<i>All unattended baggage
will be confiscated.</i>

179
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,677
Hey. Could I get
a small glass of tequila?

180
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:02,213
Like a shot of tequila?

181
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,917
Yeah, a shot.
Just keeping it classy.

182
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,084
Paging Mr. Herman.

183
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:07,752
Mr. Pee-wee Herman!

184
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,455
Look at you.

185
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,723
Hi!

186
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,757
Look at you.

187
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,593
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

188
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,961
Wow, turn it around.
This is soft.

189
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,596
-You look great.
-No.

190
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,932
I look like a dead deer
bloated on the highway.

191
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,802
No. You look like a pretty
deer who's still alive.

192
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,537
But also,
just recently hit.

193
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:29,574
-Your hair is long! It's so mermaid-y.
-Yeah.

194
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:32,977
I got a whole intricate sewn-in
system under there, but it's human.

195
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,947
Okay, well, you have to be
careful when you get fake hair

196
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,850
because some countries give their
young girls chicken hormones

197
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,951
and make them grow it
in their basements.

198
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,921
Do they get paid?
Because I would do that.

199
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:46,859
Hey, honey. I'm sure
you're out having fun

200
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:51,764
but I'm dying to see that
photo you were gonna send me.

201
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,899
She's having such a great summer,
but I think she's getting homesick.

202
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sure she misses you.

203
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,068
I miss her.

204
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,837
Like, in my body.

205
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,140
She'll be back soon.

206
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:03,975
What's your deal?
Been doing anything fun?

207
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,879
Yeah. Rescue dogs
have so many hidden skills.

208
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:10,716
I've been teaching Polenta
how to smell diabetes.

209
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,017
You've been divorced
for two years.

210
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,287
You should at least be going to
Chili's with your work friends

211
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,056
or some such basic shit,

212
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,224
instead of spending the night on
Skype dates with Mom and Dad.

213
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:21,259
I've been having
a lot of fun.

214
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:23,133
I've been teaching myself
how to make cheese.

215
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,099
I'm fine. I'm really good.
I'm real good.

216
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,134
What about you? Do you have
a job or a place to live?

217
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:32,236
I got an idea that's gonna solve
everything. Haley's gonna flip.

218
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,139
What's your idea?

219
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:37,052
I think we should move down here and
live with Mom and Dad for a while.

220
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,848
<i>Give a little bit
of heart and soul</i>

221
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,284
<i>Give a little bit
of love to grow</i>

222
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,886
<i>Give a little bit
of heart and soul...</i>

223
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,868
Holy Moses with his balls out.

224
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,936
Is that Kate Ellis
I'm looking at?

225
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,205
Maybe.

226
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,406
Hey, look at you.

227
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,711
Come on, Dave Blackmon! I was
a senior, you were a junior.

228
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,947
I lingered back so we could
be seniors together?

229
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,282
You were my first non-hand
I ever did it with.

230
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:20,686
My God. Yes.
I swallowed your earring.

231
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,221
That was a true honor.

232
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,089
Aw, thank you. Thank you.

233
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,257
Wow. Somebody told me
you died.

234
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,427
That's crazy. That's the second
person that's said that to me.

235
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,427
You should
check it out.

236
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,797
You know, I'm a known
alcoholic in this area

237
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,932
but I still talk about those
Ellis Island parties, baby.

238
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,033
Such good times, right?

239
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,770
Yeah. You scaling that
fireplace with them heels?

240
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:40,405
Man. That was
a beautiful sight, baby.

241
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:43,841
And who's this
fine-ass female?

242
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,145
Hi, Dave. I'm Maura,
Kate's younger sister.

243
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:50,281
I held your mullet back one time
when you were vomiting at our party

244
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:53,152
so you wouldn't impale your
face on our cactus garden.

245
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:56,054
No. Shit. Those were
fun times, though?

246
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:58,790
Yeah. You know, in a way.

247
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:01,426
You sure bloomed
into a juicy peach, holy...

248
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,894
Thank you, Dave.

249
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,163
So is this
your liquor store?

250
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,132
You know, I got some stock, I
got some handshake options.

251
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,700
Because you heard
what happened, right?

252
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,036
My mobile townhouse
got ate by a sinkhole.

253
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:12,937
-No.
-Eaten by a sinkhole?

254
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:15,073
That is a Florida heartbreak.

255
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,975
Wow, the Ellis sisters, man.
What a sandwich that would be?

256
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,312
If I could tell my friends
that that went down. Man.

257
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:21,346
What do you think?

258
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:23,649
Who?..

259
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,250
-Just putting it out there.
-Listen, life is about putting it out there.

260
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:27,485
-And then swatting it away.
-Isn't it?

261
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,955
Sometimes it stays out there.
Where you put it.

262
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:31,356
And then sometimes it goes
right into the trash.

263
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:32,990
So that's, like, a no.
I understand.

264
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,293
I think we should go.
Great to see you, Dave.

265
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,927
-Just putting it out there.
-Yeah, okay.

266
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,361
Nice to see you, man.
I'm glad you're alive.

267
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:38,663
Thank you.

268
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,932
You look, weathered.

269
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,800
You look like
underpass weathered.

270
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:43,735
Yeah. Thank you,
I guess. Yeah.

271
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,405
So listen, is there, like, friends
and family discount at this place?

272
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:49,808
Yeah.
Two finger discount.

273
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,811
That made my legs
feel weird.

274
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:55,313
Just unbridled filth.

275
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,249
-Gross!
-Hey, you know how it is.

276
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,283
Bye, Dave! Whoo!

277
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:01,452
The party just got back
to O-Town!

278
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,155
Okay!

279
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:06,891
It's cicada season,
so keep your mouth shut. Whoo!

280
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,197
Are you ready
for this jelly, Whorelando?

281
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,332
Yeah!

282
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:18,037
Hey!

283
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,274
Ellis sisters
in the house!

284
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,543
Hey!

285
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,110
Sweaty man.
We have to flirt.

286
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,913
Slow it down
for a groove-by.

287
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:29,947
Hey.

288
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,283
What urp? Hey.

289
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:33,885
Burying your wife?

290
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,386
Can I ask you something?

291
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:37,355
-My sister and I...
-Hey.

292
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:41,460
Are busy professionals,
looking for an "yard artisan"

293
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:43,128
to do some work on our bushes?

294
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,429
You are working.
We will not bother you. Sorry.

295
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:46,899
Jump on my bush joke.

296
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,869
I just made that up!
Put another Jenga on it.

297
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:55,307
I bet working on other people's bushes
really makes you wanna whack your weeds.

298
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,240
That was dirtier
than I thought.

299
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,875
I'm sorry. That got
dirty really fast.

300
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:59,477
Don't apologize,
I like that.

301
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,579
I actually own this house.

302
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:02,948
You live here with your wife?

303
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,917
Your wife's a bitch
for not helping you.

304
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,151
I...

305
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:08,187
I'm single, actually.

306
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,988
Well, we're not
making fun of you.

307
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,924
We're flirting with you,
because you're really sweaty.

308
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,560
I'm a solid guy. I don't mind
being the butt of your jokes.

309
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:19,064
Good. You will be the butt of our
jokes, because your butt is no joke.

310
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,399
Okay.

311
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,901
I'm not laughing at that butt.
I'll laugh with your butt.

312
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:25,036
I'm gonna laugh in that butt.

313
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,171
I'm gonna laugh.

314
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:28,539
I'm gonna...
I love to...

315
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:29,841
My butt's funny, too,

316
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,144
but your butt
is really serious.

317
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:36,248
Your butt is like
an hour-long drama.

318
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,350
<i>Your butt's as serious
as The Wire.</i>

319
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:42,086
I mean, I can't wait
to watch your butt on DVD.

320
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,288
I'm gonna binge-watch
your butt when I have the flu.

321
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,124
-Time to drive away.
-Great.

322
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,559
Yeah, so...

323
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,461
-You ever buy Poppin' Fresh Dough?
-Yeah.

324
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:50,974
-Remember the sound it makes?
-Yeah.

325
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,303
-And that's how you do it.
-My God.

326
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,950
What the hell is a sold sign
doing on our front yard?

327
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:13,417
Sold?

328
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,086
No!

329
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,422
They talked about
putting it on the market.

330
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,258
Did you know about this
and not tell me?

331
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,093
Why don't people
tell me things?

332
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,495
They spoke to me about it,
and we were considering it.

333
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:27,298
They fucking sold our fucking
childhood fucking home.

334
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,201
I can't believe they did this
without consulting me.

335
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:32,437
This home should have
been passed on.

336
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,274
-I'll talk them out of it. It's okay.
-It's not okay!

337
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,377
Because my great idea
just got fucked in the a-hole!

338
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,144
Welcome to my life!

339
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,916
Damn it. Shit!

340
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:47,251
Fuck! Shit, fuck!

341
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:48,453
Balls!

342
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:02,533
What the...

343
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:09,341
Totally shady.

344
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:12,311
Where are the curtains
with the fruit on them?

345
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,047
She was gonna give
all this stuff away?

346
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,615
I'm sorry,
I'm keeping this colander.

347
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:18,716
Heartless.

348
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,285
Where's the fucking
manatee lamp I made?

349
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,155
I'm sorry.

350
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:28,026
This was not our doing.

351
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:30,995
Where in the hell
are Mom's tiny, ceramic shoes?

352
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,633
This is just
so not okay.

353
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,569
So now some asshole family gets
to play in our sister tree?

354
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:38,669
Fuck no.

355
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:41,605
Where are our parents?

356
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,409
This nursing home better not smell
urine-y, like a death-cafeteria.

357
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,980
It's not a nursing home,
it's an adult community.

358
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:52,417
Rowdy seniors and booze by a lake?
That's a recipe for disaster.

359
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,353
You failed
to mention your plan.

360
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:57,154
Why didn't you tell me
that you sold the house?

361
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:59,057
Because we knew you'd try
to talk us out of it.

362
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,325
I mean, you were pushy kids.

363
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:02,360
You're selling your clocks,
by the way?

364
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,129
What, are you secretly dying?

365
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,531
No, I'm not dying.
I'm just sick of winding them.

366
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:09,700
The things in that house
meant something to us.

367
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:15,040
Each one of those objects is a puzzle
piece in the story of our lives.

368
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:17,108
We just don't want
clutter anymore.

369
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,744
Then what the fuck is this?

370
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,778
Clutter?
You don't want clutter?

371
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,014
Clutter has a name.

372
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,583
And it's Pogee,
the Christmas Tree Elf.

373
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:28,620
You take him. We're gonna
get a tabletop tree.

374
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,591
-Honestly...
-We can't have Christmas here!

375
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,260
It feels good to purge.

376
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:40,097
And we downloaded
all our pictures!

377
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,732
You threw away
our baby pictures?

378
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,300
No!

379
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,370
We sold them to the gay
man at the flea market

380
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,472
who turns them
into funny cards.

381
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:52,144
And your father
put them on this.

382
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:55,113
So I just stick this
up my vagina

383
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,480
and then I can see
the pictures?

384
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:58,417
-Katherine Anne. Stop.
-What?

385
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,420
She's being funny,
because this is so crazy.

386
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:05,257
What I think we all need
to do is go to lunch.

387
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:09,060
And then we can discuss if selling
the house is the best plan for us.

388
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,596
"Us" is happy
with the decision.

389
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:13,397
You two
go whoop it up.

390
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,600
No, don't go whoop it up.
It's all spiffed out.

391
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,804
It needs to stay that way
for the inspection on Monday.

392
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,739
If you have to poo,
go to Arby's.

393
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:24,775
I can't go to the bathroom
at restaurants. You know that.

394
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:26,811
All right, all right.
I understand.

395
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,146
If she's gonna poop at the house,
I wanna poop at the house.

396
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,783
-Yeah...
-All right, you can both poop at the house.

397
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:33,617
I like Arby's.

398
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:36,321
You know, let's just all agree
that this is a bad idea.

399
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:39,624
Listen to me. We're gonna take
you to dinner tomorrow night.

400
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:42,394
Not gonna spend one last
night together in the house?

401
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:43,444
Okay, I think...

402
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,462
Maura, cool it.

403
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:47,231
It's a done deal.

404
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,134
Done.

405
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,772
I got lured down here
for this?

406
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:56,442
I don't clean up after myself anymore.
I'm an adult.

407
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,611
This is gonna be
deeply painful.

408
00:18:16,928 --> 00:18:18,230
Boy.

409
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:01,706
Holy shit.

410
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:02,774
Gimme!

411
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,278
Ooh, listen to this.

412
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:09,346
"I got in a wreck
because I was admiring

413
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,849
"the shoulder hickey
that Brett gave me

414
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:13,384
"and got t-boned
by a parked car.

415
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:16,687
"Brett came over to comfort me
and I'm so obsessed with him.

416
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:18,623
"His face smells
like Sea Breeze

417
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,659
"and his hair is so long
that when I make out with him

418
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:23,427
"I pretend it's a scarf.

419
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,197
"P.S. I might be pregnant."

420
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,531
That shit is juicy.
Read yours.

421
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:28,933
Okay.

422
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,574
"I changed the grit
on my rock tumbler today.

423
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,942
"The amethyst
is really shaping up.

424
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,745
"I'm gonna mount it
in a bolo tie for Dylan.

425
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:44,283
"He got a new neck brace to
stretch his melting vertebrae.

426
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:48,687
"He loved his birthday card.

427
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,655
"Especially how I burnt
the edges of the scroll.

428
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:54,692
"P.S. Crafting heals."

429
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:03,300
"Last night at the party, I danced
so hard my bra was soaking wet.

430
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:07,572
"Jeff and I were flirting, and then
he said, 'Let me show you something.'

431
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:10,775
"So we went to my room,
and guess what he showed me?

432
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,244
"A ween that is still
wearing its hat."

433
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,712
Your turn.

434
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,382
Wow. How many times did you
have sex in this house?

435
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:18,849
You should have
had sex here.

436
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:21,252
Having sex in your childhood
bedroom is a rite of passage.

437
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:25,490
You chose the party mom role
to protect yourself from fun.

438
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:26,790
No! I was not afraid of fun.

439
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,627
Here, check this out.

440
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,362
"Happy birthday to me.

441
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:32,797
"My party was amazing.
I got what I asked for.

"I am now a sponsor
of a child in Ecuador.

could tell no one else wanted to be.

knowing everyone got home safe."

<i>"Last night was so fun
I can't even talk about it.</i>

446

"There are no, period,
words, period."

447
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:52,716
Man, I couldn't even
talk about it!

448
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,053
"I took my deaf friend
to the Sheila E. concert

449
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,855

feel the music.

"I didn't smoke pot because I was afraid
there wasn't enough for everyone."

Come on.

453
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,762
I miss those
goddamn glory days.

454
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,266
Well, clearly,
we had different experiences.

455
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:11,568
Here's a play-by-play
of a Jerry Lewis telethon.

456
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,638
Here's a chart of all
the penises I ever saw.

457
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,940
Good. Here's a quote
from Helen Keller.

458
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:18,676
Here's really incorrect information
about how to put a IUD in.

459
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,045
Here's a list
of my houseplants.

460
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:22,047
-Put it in my butt.
-Ew.

461
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,715
I swear I was having fun.

462
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:28,653
I guess I was just making sure
the house didn't get destroyed.

463
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:31,855
It's a damn shame that you
never had your night here.

464
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,361
We cannot have a party.

465
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:39,497
A party?

466
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:40,798
-That's a great idea.
-No.

467
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,501
You can't avoid putting
yourself out there forever!

468
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:45,570
You're gonna dry up
like a granny apple doll.

469
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,603
The house is sold.

470
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:48,939
No, it's not working.

471
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:51,041
Kate! Don't make that face.

472
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:54,379
Do not work me like this! I hate
it when you make me the bummer.

473
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:59,384
My life is super shitty right now.
I need to feel happy again.

474
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:04,689
Fine. Let's just brush
our remaining teeth

475
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:08,125
and call it a sad, hard day
for two dusty old twats.

476
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,361
Because we're done.

477
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:22,506
Also? P.S. It would be such an easy way for
you to pop your post-divorce flirt cherry.

478
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,776
I would love
to see you let it rip.

479
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:27,010
You're such a fun
as shit little sister.

480
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:29,948
I really am so fun.

481
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,350
-I shouldn't keep that to myself.
-No, you shouldn't!

482
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:39,990
I think maybe
we should do it.

483
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,060
Can't hear you.

484
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:44,629
I said maybe
we should have a party.

485
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:46,431
Say what
I wanna hear, girl!

486
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:48,500
My God. I don't know!

487
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:50,601
-Okay, let's do it.
-Let's have a party!

488
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:55,807
And you can invite
that cute neighbor guy

489
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,174
and you can finally have sex
in your old, crappo bed!

490
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,076
Yeah, but he's younger
than me.

491
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:00,511
Yeah, but he's taller than you,
and that's all that matters.

492
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,114
My God. I need this
night to reset myself!

493
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:05,516
We are having a party!

494
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:26,938
How'd you sleep?

495
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:29,673
I dreamt I had no job
and no place to live.

496
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:30,675
Wait.

497
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,878
Got a picture from Haley.

498
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,214
Well, Her friend has a fancy-ass
fireplace in her house.

499
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:39,083
No, it's one of those
Cosi Sandwich Shops.

500
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:40,585
Who the crap is that?

501
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,557
Are those
the new owners?

502
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,725
-Ew. Fuck my life.
-Gross!

503
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,627
I want the front yard
to be open-concept.

504
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,564
That old tree
has gotta go.

505
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:56,468
You just try to take down our
sister tree, you stupid stinkbug!

506
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,168
I can smell that bitch's
hairspray from here.

507
00:23:58,201 --> 00:24:01,239
No, they can't fucking roll in
here like Jehovah's Witnesses!

508
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:02,271
Rude.

509
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,076
What?

510
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,945
-Can we help you?
-Yes.

511
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,114
Our secretary didn't tell us
that we had an appointment.

512
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:12,951
I'm Patrick Campbell.
This is Jane and Henry Geernt.

513
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:15,153
They're relocating from New York
City and buying this house.

514
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:17,721
So, are you their interpreter?

515
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:20,158
If so, please tell them
hello for us.

516
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:23,027
They just want to see what these
blues look like on the sun porch.

517
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,928
What do you mean?
Sun porch?

518
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,897
Are you even old enough
to get a mortgage?

519
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:29,634
Yes. But we're
buying it with cash.

520
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,836
You're painting
the sun porch? No.

521
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:36,106
It's a little
"country" for us.

522
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,044
Can you let your parents know that if
things like this aren't fixed by Monday,

523
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:42,516
we're gonna have a real issue
following through with the sale.

524
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,115
Yeah.
That won't be okay.

525
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:46,283
I got a question.

526
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:49,621
What percentage of your
wardrobe is dry clean only?

527
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:50,888
Seventy-eight?

528
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,757
You know there was
a murder here, right?

529
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:54,591
No. What? I don't.

530
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,027
Major cult stuff. Yeah.

531
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,995
What, like a mass murder?

532
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,096
Seven?

533
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,163
Okay.

534
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:01,231
Seven sets of twins.

535
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:02,417
So, 14.

536
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,568
I'm sorry. What?

537
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,769
You know
your cousin's gay, right?

538
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:06,169
That's not my cousin.
That's my husband.

539
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:07,971
That's your husband?

540
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:10,645
You're gonna have some surprising
shit go down in about 10 years.

541
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,842
Blue?

542
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,645
What would possess a person
to paint stained wood blue?

543
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,714
What, were you raised
on a tugboat?

544
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:20,018
I'll drop off the paint later.
Unless you'll be day-napping.

545
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,686
We sleep with our eyes
open, like sharks.

546
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:28,793
Bye! Nice to meet you!

547
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:30,228
Smell you later.

548
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,195
What kind
of last name is Geernt?

549
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:34,899
Geernt. Sounds like
a queef on a yoga ball.

550
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:37,572
Yeah. More like the last sound you
hear before you shit your pants.

551
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,270
-My God.
-My God. My God.

552
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:43,875
Okay. Let's start working
on those invites.

553
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:57,721
Okay, let's see
who we got. Okay.

554
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,224
-Vicka Bastione.
-Yeah.

555
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,760
No on Alex. He's always on.
It's annoying as fuck.

556
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:06,230
I know. He breaks my heart.
He wants to be funny, though.

557
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:08,182
Yeah, well, people in hell
want ice water, too.

558
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:11,669
Brinda is a hard no.

559
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:13,738
That monster and her minions
are not coming.

560
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,872
Why is she a monster?

561
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:16,273
She knows what she did.

562
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:17,775
Okay. Rob and Liz!

563
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:20,177
They used to have sex
in the weirdest places.

564
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,680
He took her from behind
in line at graduation.

565
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:25,682
They could use a party.
They are terminally suburban.

566
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:27,184
Kelly.
That bitch is fun.

567
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,252
-Yeah.
-Kelly is fun!

568
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:29,287
Kelly is fun.

569
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,898
So, we should go!
We have so much to do.

570
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,767
You have to invite that cute
guy from down the street.

571
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,736
Maybe.
I don't know. We'll see.

572
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,884
Have a great day, Fran.

573
00:27:02,353 --> 00:27:04,422
My God.
It's Brinda.

574
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,793
Brinda always looks like she has
a fart coming out sideways.

575
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:13,163
I feel bad that we didn't invite her. I
hate it when people aren't included.

576
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:14,731
God. What if she asks us
to come to the party?

577
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,234
I'm not gonna be able
to say no to her face.

578
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,336
You know I can't reject people.
I have a dog with one eye.

579
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:19,803
Here she comes. She's coming close.
She's right here.

580
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:21,236
She's almost here.
She's here now.

581
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:23,240
Hey, Brinda.
What up?

582
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:25,709
Well, well, well.

583
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,046
I thought I saw
the Ellis sisters.

584
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:30,781
Hey, Brinda.
What have you been up to?

585
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,451
Not much. Just, you know,
building a career.

586
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:38,255
Being successful and having a
really full and wonderful life.

587
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:40,258
I'm very blessed.

588
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,293
I'm sure you've seen around town, I'm
a pretty successful realtor now.

589
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:45,962
I'm plastered
all over the bus stops.

590
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:47,298
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

591
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,733
I thought you were missing. I saw
your picture on the bus stop.

592
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,068
I just assumed
you were missing.

593
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,805
And you? What are you up to?
Nothing?

594
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:55,873
What are you buying?
Stool softener?

595
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:58,142
No. Actually,
Diet Coke.

596
00:27:58,174 --> 00:28:00,344
Don't you look great.
That's a snazzy belt.

597
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:02,079
Thank you!

598
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,993
Yeah, congrats on
your wrestling championship.

599
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:06,183
It's Ralph Lauren.

600
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,218
Is that how you say it?

601
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,219
Yeah.

602
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,721
Do you get
good Wi-Fi with that?

603
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:11,888
So I see
you're having a party.

604
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:13,290
I mean, we're just
kind of picking...

605
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,892
-Yep. Having a party.
-Yeah.

606
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:17,060
I heard you were
having a party.

607
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,463
From someone
who got invited.

608
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,365
You were on our list, but
you're very hard to track down.

609
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:23,767
Are you on email?

610
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,269
It's B-dot-rinda...

611
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:28,906
That's what I did wrong.
I forgot the dot.

612
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,208
And we forgot
to type it.

613
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,210
And also
we didn't send it.

614
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:33,944
I must admit,

615
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,913
when I heard you were having
an Ellis Island party

616
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:38,215
I was like,
"What? What year is it?"

617
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,817
It's pretty sad.

618
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:42,887
You know, because it's
such a desperate event.

619
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:46,924
Bye.

620
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:51,128
You're a desperate event!

621
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,797
I can still hear you!

622
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,264
Good.
Can you hear this?

623
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,967
Suck a fucking bag
of dicks!

624
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,201
She can't hear that.

625
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:59,836
Strutting around Big Lots
like it's Bloomingdale's

626
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,271
in her bullshit shoes.

627
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:04,108
Real estate bitch
acting like Suze Orman.

628
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:06,544
You know what she has?
Crabs in her eyebrows.

629
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,913
Tumbleweeds
rolling across her beav.

630
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,948
I am done wasting words
on that ho.

631
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:13,951
-I'm sorry, Vicky.
-Don't apologize for me.

632
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:16,453
Is Vicky your real name?

633
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,124
What's your Korean name?

634
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:24,495
Hae-Won.

635
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:27,464
Hae-Won. What a beautiful name.
What does that mean?

636
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:29,000
Hae-Won mean "head."

637
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:34,372
Hae-Won?
Am I saying it correctly?

638
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:35,572
Hae-Won.

639
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,340
Hae-Won.

640
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:39,477
No. Hae-Won.

641
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:40,944
Hae-Won.

642
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:44,081
Not Hae-Won. Hae-Won.

643
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,266
Hae-Won.

644
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:46,417
No. Hae-Won.

645
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,352
-Hae-Won.
-Hae-Won.

646
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:49,753
Hae-Won.

647
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,122
Hae-Won.

648
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:53,290
I feel like
I'm saying it right. No?

649
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,226
-I'm too high.
-Hae-Hae-Won.

650
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:57,929
Yes.

651
00:29:57,961 --> 00:29:59,462
It's not coming out right,
but I'll get it.

652
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:02,300
Like, "I'm having fun
at party."

653
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,036
"Hey." Plus "one."

654
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:08,506
Hey one.

655
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:10,173
-So you like parties.
-Yes.

656
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:12,676
Your name?

657
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,045
My name is Maura.

658
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:15,512
Maura.

659
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:17,014
Watch me. Maura.

660
00:30:17,047 --> 00:30:18,481
Maura.

661
00:30:18,515 --> 00:30:21,118
I don't open my mouth like that.
Just, Maura.

662
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:22,353
Maura.

663
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,521
It's not Maura.

664
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:27,158
You see the difference
in my mouth? Maura.

665
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:28,358
Maura.

666
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:29,861
We have different mouths.

667
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,095
It's okay.

668
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:38,269
Why do they always have to give
them American names? It's so sad.

669
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:41,404
I bet Nail Pimp Daddy over there
treats them like his whores.

670
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:43,608
-We need to get Lucy Liu to go under...
-Lisa Ling.

671
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,010
Lisa Ling to go undercover and
investigate these dirty-ass nail salons.

672
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:50,480
But they are hiring and you
are licensed to do nails.

673
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:53,516
I don't wanna work here. They
have a bass in their aquarium.

674
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:56,319
It's beautiful here. Everything
smells like lavender.

675
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:58,656
Plus, you could teach them a
lot, because you know your shit.

676
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,490
I do know my shit.

677
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:02,963
I could French manicure a chicken
while it was running away.

678
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,596
Guess I could get something
better once we're settled, right?

679
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,101
Exactly! And then just wait
until you get that better job

680
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,402
before you quit this one.

681
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,471
I'm open to new ways.

682
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:18,676
So, do you like
working here?

683
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,111
I love it.

684
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,547
Do you get proper
lunch breaks?

685
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:24,648
What is lunch?

686
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:27,451
My God.
That's terrible.

687
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:29,287
Hey.

688
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:31,288
Thank you so much for this.
This is a great place.

689
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:32,321
Of course.

690
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,095
So, I see you're hiring.

691
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:41,632
We are not
hiring right now.

692
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,403
You just got
a big old sign.

693
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:49,272
Hey, Hae-Won. Would you like
to come to a party tonight?

694
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:51,275
You and your friends
come, okay?

695
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:52,676
To do nail?

696
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,145
No. No, no, no.
Party?

697
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,447
You can bring
whoever you want.

698
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,082
Party, yes.

699
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:00,200
Sojus.

700
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,384
Jews.

701
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,721
-Soju there?
-Sure. There'll be Jews there.

702
00:32:03,753 --> 00:32:06,990
I love jus.
Koreans love jus.

703
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:08,158
Koreans love Jews.

704
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,027
-I love jus.
-I love Jews, too.

705
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,260
Jus.

706
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:14,230
Adam is thinking of coming, and
Gabe is on the fence, so...

707
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:15,331
Soju.

708
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,445
I'm worried we aren't talking
about the same thing.

709
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:20,438
-Juice. Drinking juice.
-Jus.

710
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,972
You stupid.

711
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,408
There'll be juice there. There'll be
food there. There'll be Jews there.

712
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:26,376
-Okay. Yes.
-Great.

713
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,246
Okay, listen. My daughter
and I are moving to Orlando

714
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:31,449
and I really need a job.

715
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,116
No.

716
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:39,489
Okay, look. Just smile and shake
my hand like you gave me a job

717
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:41,192
and I will text you
a picture of my boobs.

718
00:32:41,224 --> 00:32:43,326
Real good ones.
High and happy.

719
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,096
No? I misread your deal.

720
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:46,296
Smile and shake my hand

721
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:48,665
or I will text you a
picture of my boobs,

722
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:50,201
and I know you don't
wanna see them.

723
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:54,404
Awesome! Thank you, Vicky.

724
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:56,975
I will see you on Monday.

725
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,676
Boom! I got a job.

726
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,712
And look what I pulled out of your wallet.
"Success is desire in action."

727
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,482
Amazing! You're crushing it!

728
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,783
Whoo!

729
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,084
We need to cancel dinner
with Mom and Dad.

730
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:10,186
What if we lie to Mom and Dad and
then they die in their sleep?

731
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,288
Don't let them
smell your guilt.

732
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:15,192
Girls.

733
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:17,360
Hey, Mom, we are doing
so much work over there

734
00:33:17,394 --> 00:33:19,394
and doing nothing else,
and I am telling the truth.

735
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,798
Well.

736
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:26,037
I was just, putting the
silverware in the drawers here.

737
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:28,172
Hey, we can't
have dinner tonight.

738
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:32,442
Yeah, because we're in such packing
mode we don't wanna stop our groove.

739
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:34,412
Sounds good!

740
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:51,327
No. We've...

741
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:52,696
Okay!

742
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:54,565
-Bye.
-We're leaving!

743
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,733
Did we just cock block
our parents?

744
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,402
They were fresh
off the sex griddle.

745
00:33:58,434 --> 00:33:59,914
There was so much
color in her face.

746
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,676
Hey, see you tonight! You know,
I'm laying down a bread base.

747
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,845
So I wanna stop by Sam and
Cray's house, real quick.

748
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:09,612
I haven't seen those homos
since high school!

749
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:11,582
I know.

750
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:13,583
They said that we could borrow those
cool chairs they had at their wedding.

751
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:16,220
Gays know
how to throw a party.

752
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:19,457
Go to Costco,
get a pan of hot wings.

753
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,692
Get some big,
basic salamis.

754
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:24,427
Or just make a fuckload
of potato salad.

755
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,762
With Tostitos Scoops.

756
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:28,765
It's like a spoon
you can eat.

757
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:33,336
Obviously, it's the gay men who
have the great party ideas.

758
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,606
I wish being gay was a choice because I
always did like that shorts and boots look.

759
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,509
Yeah, I don't know.

760
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,210
For me, the deal breaker might
be the eating of the pussy.

761
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,484
Really? Because for me it would just be
the fucking unbearable amount of talking.

762
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:44,548
Bye, guys!

763
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:53,824
What do you think,
Brayla?

764
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:56,226
That looks amazing on you.

765
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,528
I never met a Brayla before.

766
00:34:58,561 --> 00:35:00,197
I know, like, three.

767
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,867
So you're trending.
God bless.

768
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,570
You know, it's a lot of under teat but
I think I'm getting away with it.

769
00:35:07,603 --> 00:35:09,339
Also it's, on backwards.

770
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:13,878
-You think?
-Yeah.

771
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:15,918
How's it going in there?

772
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,516
I don't get this dress.

773
00:35:18,548 --> 00:35:21,585
One of my apples
keeps rolling out of the bag.

774
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:24,554
But I like the story
it tells with the fringe.

775
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:26,356
You're gonna have to rock a
thong with this, though.

776
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:29,393
No, I don't wear thongs.
I have a very fussy taint.

777
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:31,828
You just have to build up a callus.
Right, Brayla?

778
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:34,298
That looks amazing on you.

779
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:36,934
I worry that she just wants the sale.
She's not telling us the truth.

780
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,804
No. Brayla has no
pleasure center in her brain.

781
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,838
Here we go.

782
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:44,741
Haley!
How-slash-where are you?

783
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,477
<i>You can trust me.</i>

784
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,845
I am at a friend's house.

785
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:49,880
<i>So I got your text message</i>

786
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:53,317
about moving in with Gram and Gramps,
and you know I love Orlando.

787
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,652
I'm super excited about this!

788
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,688
Yeah, you know what? I was
real excited about it, too,

789
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,757
and it turns out that Gram and
Gramps are selling their house.

790
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:05,563
Okay, I like that it
has a strong message,

791
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,731
but I am afraid that I'm gonna
zip my bush up in there.

792
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:11,169
We can still make Orlando happen. I
promise, I will find another way.

793
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,271
Don't be upset.

794
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:16,440
Okay, give it to me.

795
00:36:16,472 --> 00:36:17,491
Hey, honey.
It's Maura.

796
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:18,509
Hey.

797
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,677
Listen, your mom forgot to tell
you the most important part,

798
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,215
which is that she got a job out
here at a very fancy nail salon.

799
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:26,649
<i>-Really?
-Yes.</i>

800
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:28,217
Try something on.

801
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:32,456
So I think maybe you should come here
earlier next week, and surprise her.

802
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:34,625
She really misses you.

803
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:37,661
Aunt Maura, I don't know.
I don't know.

804
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:40,297
Haley, I know I said that I was
going to help you for a while,

805
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:42,365
but now you have to get
back with your mother.

806
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:44,335
<i>I hate keeping secrets.</i>

807
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:47,503
Especially from my sister.
It gives me guilt diarrhea.

808
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,639
Okay. But what should I do
with Polenta?

809
00:36:51,675 --> 00:36:54,378
<i>The dog-sitter's number
is on the counter.</i>

810
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:57,815
Use my credit card, and get
a flight, and come here.

811
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,916
It's gonna work this time,
honey, I promise.

812
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:01,384
Okay, if you think so.

813
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:03,721
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

814
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:04,755
<i>Bye.</i>

815
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:08,692
Haley's good.
It's all fine.

816
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,893
Aw. That's awesome. Thanks.

817
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:13,364
These dresses are made for
Chinese tomboys, by the way.

818
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:14,664
I don't know
about that one.

819
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:16,666
Really, because
what about this part?

820
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:22,273
-That's a Play-Doh Fun Factory right there.
-Ooh.

821
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,441
-And the eye goes right to it.
-Yeah, look at that.

822
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:32,282
That is flesh, and dudes like that. They
don't care what thing it's coming out of.

823
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:33,283
This dress
smells like pickles.

824
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,550
Better work.

825
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:35,918
It just feels like
it's maybe one or the other.

826
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,888
I think it's what they call
"either/and."

827
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,355
No, I don't. Well...

828
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:41,492
Right, Brayla?
Brayla, where you from?

829
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,061
That looks
amazing on you.

830
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:46,630
We got to find another store,
they can't handle our heat here.

831
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:50,934
God. We need, like, a little less "Forever
21" and a little more "Suddenly 42."

832
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:53,470
Yeah. We are
keeping it tight.

833
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:55,806
It is tight.
This is very tight.

834
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:57,740
Here, give me a kiss.

835
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,717
-Wait. Where are we going?
-One last errand.

836
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,639
Get it, girl.

837
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,923
What?

838
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:17,427
My God. Damn it. I knew it!
You never offer to drive.

839
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,730
Ask him. "Desire needs action," or
whatever the fuck that one said.

840
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:23,501
I don't have my good bra on.
I have beef jerky breath.

841
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:25,535
Okay. Okay.

842
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:27,672
-Hi.
-Hi.

843
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:32,509
I'm, Maura,
from yonder there.

844
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:35,645
My sister and I
objectified you yesterday?

845
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,914
I remember you.

846
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,883
-I'm James.
-Hi, James.

847
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:40,983
Do you go by Jimmy?

848
00:38:41,016 --> 00:38:43,619
Usually James,
sometimes James.

849
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:45,972
Well, just wanted to say hello.
And that's all I got, so.

850
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:54,565
Would you borrow me
your bathroom?

851
00:38:55,898 --> 00:38:57,233
Number one only.

852
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:59,736
Of course, come in. You can do
whatever you want in there, really.

853
00:38:59,769 --> 00:39:01,072
Wow.

854
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:04,474
I am actually just renovating it,
I'm gonna put it on the market.

855
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:07,510
-Wow. You're doing a really nice job.
-Thank you.

856
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:10,413
It was my parents' house, but they
passed away within a year of each other.

857
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:13,117
My God. That's horrible.

858
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,086
Yeah. Yeah,
it was really sad.

859
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:19,722
Are you gonna be okay?

860
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:22,158
I'm sorry. It's just that's,
like, my worst fear.

861
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:25,496
I'm sorry I told you. I'm sorry
you had to find out this way.

862
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:26,731
My legs just went numb.

863
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,066
I'll be okay.

864
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,501
Do you still
need the bathroom?

865
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,735
I think I'm too sad
to go now.

866
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:32,768
Yeah, of course.

867
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:34,670
Okay.

868
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:36,006
Hey, who's this guy?

869
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,876
That's Mashed Potatoes.

870
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,177
I'm pretty mad
at him right now.

871
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,644
Hey!

872
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:47,518
Would you like to
flank me at a party

873
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,152
that I'm attending at
my own house tonight?

874
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,488
Him or me?

875
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:52,623
-You.
-Yeah, yeah.

876
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:54,925
Maybe. What time?

877
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,461
8:30. 8:45. 9:00.

878
00:39:57,494 --> 00:39:59,896
You know, it doesn't matter.
I'm pretty laid back.

879
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:03,199
Okay, okay. Let me just,
check my calendar real quick.

880
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:05,068
You're lucky. I am free.

881
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:06,704
Well, that's a good news!

882
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:10,540
I'm not Italian. I don't know
why I said it like that.

883
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,041
No, I like Italians.

884
00:40:12,074 --> 00:40:14,010
Okay. I'm half-Italian.

885
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:15,311
No, I'm not. That was a lie.

886
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:20,818
So, I'm just gonna casually George
Jefferson my way out of here.

887
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,186
-To you.
-All right.

888
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:27,156
Gonna ease on down the road
and re-run it to the car.

889
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,692
Okay, goodbye.

890
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:37,166
Bye!

891
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,199
Kate, let me in.

892
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,572
Hello.

893
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,739
Hi. Why?

894
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:44,708
We were measuring
for a pergola.

895
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,876
I'm sorry,
are you having a party here?

896
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,678
-Nope.
-Nope.

897
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:50,980
It really looks like
you're having a party.

898
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:53,483
Gosh. I hate to make
you feel like a dick,

899
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:55,852
but this is
actually for a wake.

900
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:58,154
I am very sorry to hear that.

901
00:40:58,188 --> 00:41:01,825
Yeah. We always told our cousin,
"Don't play on the tracks."

902
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:03,126
Dear God.

903
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,760
I'm so sorry for your loss.

904
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:06,663
Obviously,
our cousin was a dumb-ass.

905
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:09,099
-But we will miss her.
-Him.

906
00:41:09,132 --> 00:41:10,666
Herm. His name was Herm.

907
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:12,869
They found his head,
like, a mile away.

908
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:15,204
I think he's probably gonna
haunt the house forever.

909
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:16,806
-Headless and angry.
-Yeah.

910
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:19,775
I am not buying
that bull waste.

911
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:21,577
That's a girl's belt.

912
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,146
Rich people can just decide
to move somewhere.

913
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:26,649
Choke on a roll of cash.

914
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:27,784
So I've been thinking.

915
00:41:27,817 --> 00:41:28,751
Why?

916
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:31,621
You've asserted yourself,
and you got a job,

917
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,591
so maybe I could
give you a loan.

918
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:36,292
To get a new place.

919
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:38,628
When you say, "loan," do you
mean the kind you pay back,

920
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:40,963
or, like, a "wink-wink" loan?

921
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:42,065
All loans are
supposed to be paid back.

922
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:43,666
Not in my experience.

923
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,568
But you can do that now
because you have a job.

924
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:47,703
I do.

925
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:51,041
That is an awesome offer.
All right!

926
00:41:51,074 --> 00:41:52,976
Okay, wait.

927
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:55,978
I am going to ask you for something
in return for the money,

928
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:58,682
and I don't want you to think that
this loan is contingent on that,

929
00:41:58,715 --> 00:42:00,684
but I will say that
if you don't do it,

930
00:42:00,717 --> 00:42:02,653
I feel like I might
not give you the money.

931
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,921
Okay. Great. What?

932
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:09,693
It's a lot harder than I thought.
Just give me a minute.

933
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:13,896
Will you be
the party mom tonight?

934
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:15,832
So I can let my
freak flag fly?

935
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,101
I would love to.

936
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:19,269
Yeah?

937
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,956
Because your face is
telling me something else.

938
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:26,643
That would bring me joy.

939
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:28,878
You know what? Forget it. It'll
just get screwed up. I'll do it.

940
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:30,313
You don't think I can
take care of people?

941
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,317
I am an actual mom!
I got this!

942
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,585
Okay, but the party mom
can't drink.

943
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,021
What fresh fuckery is that?

944
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:40,094
Does a mother drink
at her kid's birthday party?

945
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:41,692
Yeah, if there's a lifeguard.

946
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:43,226
No.

947
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:44,994
It's okay. I don't mind.

948
00:42:45,027 --> 00:42:47,296
Forget it.
I'll be fine. It's okay.

949
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:58,141
Okay. I won't drink tonight.
You groin it up.

950
00:42:58,173 --> 00:43:00,110
I'll be you. You be me.

951
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:03,780
My God. So many red flags!
Okay. Let's do this!

952
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:08,652
When you're flirting with Mr. Man,
don't weave your divorce tale.

953
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:12,188
Drunk people like to show off with fire.
Shut it down.

954
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:16,960
Over-pronounce things, because he
is gonna be watching your mouth.

955
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:19,232
Remember, don't leave someone
when they're throwing up.

956
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:21,064
Sleep-barfing kills.

957
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:23,734
Once you're in the bedroom,

958
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,701
lock the door so
I can't burst in

959
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:27,175
and take
a commemorative picture.

960
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:32,241
Kate, can you clean
up this gel, please?

961
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,811
Yes! Stop asking me about it.

962
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:53,964
It's that scary time when you're
afraid that no one will show up.

963
00:43:53,996 --> 00:43:56,000
It's 8:32.
People aren't gonna...

964
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:01,038
Take it, girl.
This is your show.

965
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:05,842
Hey.

966
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:06,976
Hey! Hi!

967
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,077
Hey!

968
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,179
It's Rob and Liz.
And their son.

969
00:44:10,213 --> 00:44:11,281
Nope.

970
00:44:11,313 --> 00:44:12,882
Not happening. No kids.

971
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,217
Yeah, he can just
watch TV downstairs.

972
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,353
No. Him got to go.

973
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:18,865
Yeah. Sorry, there's just too
many things he could ingest.

974
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:22,459
We'll be back.

975
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:25,362
Chase,
we are gonna go see Nana.

976
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:27,030
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yay!

977
00:44:27,063 --> 00:44:28,365
You remember her, right?

978
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:30,367
Damn. Adults are
on time?

979
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,001
Yeah.

980
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:34,237
Why is Alex
walking up our driveway?

981
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:37,440
I'm so sorry. I invited him, because I
feel bad for him. He's very lonely.

982
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,876
Knock, knock. Who's there?

983
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:42,144
Duane! Duane who?

984
00:44:42,177 --> 00:44:43,346
Duane the bathtub.

985
00:44:43,378 --> 00:44:46,382
I'm dwowning!

986
00:44:48,885 --> 00:44:50,187
You still got it!

987
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:52,388
May I please have
a beverage?

988
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:55,825
Sanctuary!

989
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:58,994
Wow!

990
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:01,997
Welcome to Jurassic Park!

991
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,169
Christ, he is
immediately exhausting.

992
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:07,270
Hello there.

993
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:08,904
Fun train pulling in!

994
00:45:08,938 --> 00:45:10,040
Booze, booze!

995
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,141
Whoo-hoo!

996
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:21,719
And when my dad finally died,
he actually glowed.

997
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,322
Kelly!

998
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:27,157
When did we all get so old?

999
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,092
I mean, at least the women
are making an effort,

1000
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,893
but the men here?

1001
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:33,896
Look like they're
being slowly poisoned.

1002
00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:37,199
I think it's about
how you feel, right?

1003
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:38,936
Done. You know?

1004
00:45:40,202 --> 00:45:42,338
Best days behind us.
Right, guys?

1005
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:46,275
I don't know. You might live like
another eight or 10 years, Kelly.

1006
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:48,178
You don't wanna be
looking at it like that.

1007
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,879
Chase was like
a 10-pound baby.

1008
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,414
So when he came out of there,

1009
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:52,866
I mean, it was decimated.

1010
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:54,284
That's horrible.

1011
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:56,920
So I ended up having
a vaginal rejuvenation.

1012
00:45:56,952 --> 00:45:59,789
It's as tight as
a keyhole down there.

1013
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:02,858
I could pick up quarters
with it, if I wanted to.

1014
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:04,260
I haven't wanted to yet.

1015
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:06,028
I shouldn't be
telling you this,

1016
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:07,864
but Rob's penis
has a kink in it.

1017
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:09,298
I can't think of
what it's called.

1018
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,500
It's kind of, like, crimped?

1019
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:13,836
I don't know.
I can't even...

1020
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,572
There they are. Yeah.

1021
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:16,873
Hey.

1022
00:46:16,905 --> 00:46:18,108
She bragging about me?

1023
00:46:20,108 --> 00:46:22,244
Put a bunch of videos
on YouTube yesterday.

1024
00:46:22,277 --> 00:46:26,115
<i>I'm up to a hundred hits,
so, sensacion, as they say.</i>

1025
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,251
It's empty.

1026
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:31,053
Boink!

1027
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:36,827
He has a yeast infection in his
paws, between his paw pads,

1028
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,297
and I have to get a wipe, and I have
to wipe out his paws every night.

1029
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:41,498
Are you gonna
get me a drink?

1030
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,299
Can you give me
a chance to offer?

1031
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,971
One thousand euthanized a year
just in this county.

1032
00:46:48,003 --> 00:46:51,407
I woke up one day, and boom.
No more periods.

1033
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:55,311
What the fuckenheimer?
Grown-up parties suck.

1034
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:58,614
How can one person
have two colonoscopy stories?

1035
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:00,128
I'm gonna get
the dancing started.

1036
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:02,552
Get in there, kid.

1037
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:03,954
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1038
00:47:03,955 --> 00:47:05,322
Hi.

1039
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,456
Such an uninvited hug.

1040
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:10,160
Whoo!

1041
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:12,996
Come on.
Here we go. Here we go!

1042
00:47:13,028 --> 00:47:14,965
<i>Hey, you can't
start with Mony Mony!</i>

1043
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,266
That's like
starting with anal.

1044
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:17,298
All right.

1045
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:20,237
Geernt!

1046
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:25,474
Hi, there.
Dropping off paint.

1047
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:27,143
I'll put it by the pool.

1048
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:28,175
-So?
-Okay.

1049
00:47:30,213 --> 00:47:31,915
My apologies.
I was worried

1050
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:34,317
you were having a party,
but I see now,

1051
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:36,085
you really are having a wake.

1052
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,125
Hey.

1053
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:46,463
This party is fucking lame.
Do you...

1054
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,631
Drugs? I know a guy.

1055
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,066
Call him.

1056
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:51,233
-Hello!
-Hi!

1057
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:53,369
Hae-Won!

1058
00:47:53,402 --> 00:47:54,471
No, Hae-Won.

1059
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:57,106
Right, sorry. You made it.
I can't believe it. Look!

1060
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,442
What? Look at this
flock of hotties.

1061
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:01,377
Wow. You look so happy.

1062
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,547
You look so free and not oppressed at all.
We were worried about you.

1063
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:06,982
Really? We were
worried about you.

1064
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:10,153
Both your feet
looked like dried beef.

1065
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:12,422
I knew you were
talking shit about us.

1066
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:13,556
Who wants a drink?
Come on.

1067
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,325
-Let's go get drink!
-Let's party!

1068
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,060
Thank you so
much for having us.

1069
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:18,994
-What? You're leaving?
-Great party.

1070
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:20,296
-Kate, they're leaving.
-Hey!

1071
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:21,463
Chase has night terrors.

1072
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:22,598
Absolutely not.

1073
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:24,567
Everybody,
huddle up for a second.

1074
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:28,038
To anyone who's even
thinking about leaving,

1075
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:29,405
you can forget it.

1076
00:48:29,438 --> 00:48:31,540
You need this
as much as we do.

1077
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,209
Just as much as we do.

1078
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:35,278
If you think I strapped
all this shit on tonight

1079
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:37,480
<i>so you could be home
to watch Flip or Flop,</i>

1080
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:39,348
you are fucking dreaming.

1081
00:48:39,382 --> 00:48:40,983
You're dreaming.

1082
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:43,419
Dan and Kim.
You got four kids,

1083
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:46,355
and from what I can thin slice from
your Christmas letters, they're wangs.

1084
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:48,724
Thank you. Wait, what?

1085
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:52,461
Kelly! Your profile pic is a
low-fat Mexican casserole.

1086
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,063
Yeah, it is.

1087
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:58,101
Rob, when was
the last time you danced

1088
00:48:58,134 --> 00:48:59,702
with the night air
hitting your nips?

1089
00:48:59,735 --> 00:49:02,271
Guns N' Roses.
Citrus Bowl, 1991.

1090
00:49:04,306 --> 00:49:07,176
Don't you wanna feel
that carefree again?

1091
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,579
Just, like,
balls deep in joy?

1092
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:11,514
-Yes!
-It's not too late!

1093
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:14,416
The young you
still lives inside you.

1094
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:16,152
Just like shingles, y'all.

1095
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:18,054
We used to party
in this house like animals

1096
00:49:18,086 --> 00:49:20,123
because we thought
we would never die.

1097
00:49:20,155 --> 00:49:22,458
I say, tonight,
we party like Vikings

1098
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:24,728
because we know we
could die tomorrow!

1099
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,362
Let's light a boat on fire!

1100
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:30,300
Tonight
is my gift to you!

1101
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:33,470
Drink up and run with scissors
tonight, because Mama got you.

1102
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,071
Aw, shit!

1103
00:49:35,103 --> 00:49:36,638
Yeah, Mama!

1104
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:38,273
Now, go call your sitters!

1105
00:49:38,306 --> 00:49:39,608
But what should we call them?

1106
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:44,114
Alex is still funny, guys.

1107
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:47,483
-Thanks.
-I'm pouring shots.

1108
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:50,085
-Now remind me that you know how to do this.
-Whoo!

1109
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:51,387
I remember
how to do it!

1110
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,288
And let's dance
our titties off!

1111
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,059
Shot, shot, shot!

1112
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:01,565
Next round, vodka!

1113
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:03,632
Have you done it?

1114
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:09,572
Only people
with children.

1115
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:11,125
-People with kids.
-People with kids.

1116
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:43,239
Hey!

1117
00:50:43,271 --> 00:50:45,074
That's a really beautiful orchid.
Is that for me?

1118
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,410
No, this is mine.

1119
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:49,546
Maura.
Invite Doctor Bushwhack in.

1120
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,614
Show him where to put
his things. I'll greet.

1121
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:53,482
Please come in,
and take off your...

1122
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,418
Just come in.

1123
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:56,586
There you go.

1124
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:58,088
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1125
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,090
-It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

1126
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,557
Wow. It smells amazing.

1127
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:04,294
Do orchids smell?

1128
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,796
They can,
if you get fungus gnats.

1129
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:09,632
And those are hard to get rid of.
It stinks up your whole house.

1130
00:51:09,664 --> 00:51:11,733
But this one looks good.

1131
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:13,368
Yeah,
this is pretty healthy.

1132
00:51:13,402 --> 00:51:15,304
Why don't you
greet your guests?

1133
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,574
I'm gonna make myself a drink,
and face the wall.

1134
00:51:22,277 --> 00:51:24,847
Cover time. Twenty bucks for
the booze and food, please.

1135
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,516
Kate. The lesbians are here.

1136
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:27,884
Excellent.

1137
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,719
Hey. Cool if I spin
some tunes?

1138
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:32,422
I'm afraid to tell you no.

1139
00:51:32,454 --> 00:51:33,889
-Great.
-Great.

1140
00:51:33,922 --> 00:51:35,157
Let them through,
everybody!

1141
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:44,300
Get ready for a Sarah
McLachlan/Tracy Chapman mash-up.

1142
00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:48,471
Yeah!

1143
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,306
Shit.

1144
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:06,255
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

1145
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,590
How's it going in there?

1146
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:10,260
Well, I told him
about my fungus gnats.

1147
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,729
Let him do
the bulk of the talking.

1148
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:15,198
Yeah, I'm just afraid
when it gets quiet.

1149
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,833
Good things are
hidden in the quiet.

1150
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:19,234
Who said that?

1151
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:20,570
I did. I'm smart.

1152
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:21,938
Okay.

1153
00:52:21,971 --> 00:52:23,651
You should put that
on one of your cards.

1154
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,451
<i>But it is expected of you. Your
absence has already been noted.</i>

1155
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:37,252
<i>The boy means nothing to me.</i>

1156
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:39,289
<i>I can't stand
the wailing of women.</i>

1157
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:42,724
God, I could watch
Tyrion slap the smug

1158
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:45,227
off that little fucker's
face a hundred times

1159
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,695
and never get sick of it.

1160
00:52:46,728 --> 00:52:50,199
<i>Did you know that Jack Gleeson was
the little boy in Batman Begins?</i>

1161
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,902
Jean, when you use
the actors' real names,

1162
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:55,404
you're not allowing yourself to
live inside the fantasy world

1163
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,740
that they've so
lovingly crafted for us.

1164
00:52:57,773 --> 00:53:01,477
<i>And just a reminder there's a no
phone policy on our G.O.T. nights.</i>

1165
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,778
I'm sorry.

1166
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:06,248
Ian Mitchell keeps posting photos
of the Ellis Island party,

1167
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:08,851
and it looks
like kinda damn fun.

1168
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:11,221
I kinda wanna drop by.

1169
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:12,389
They have cheese.

1170
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:15,592
Cheese.

1171
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,327
All we have is wine.

1172
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,362
And it's non-alcoholic.

1173
00:53:19,394 --> 00:53:21,463
We don't have to take
off our shoes there.

1174
00:53:21,496 --> 00:53:23,932
And there
aren't so many rules.

1175
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:28,904
I'll take another one...

1176
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:29,938
-Hey.
-Hey.

1177
00:53:32,307 --> 00:53:35,777
Man, I haven't been
to a party in a while.

1178
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:38,748
I know. The last party I went to
was probably my wedding reception.

1179
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:46,923
-This wine...
-So did you see your parents die?

1180
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:48,791
No, I didn't,

1181
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:52,427
but I know they did.

1182
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,463
Well, that's good to know.

1183
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:55,831
It's not good to know.

1184
00:53:56,898 --> 00:53:58,534
Hey, it's okay.

1185
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:00,469
I mean,
you can ask me anything.

1186
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,903
What do you want
to know about me?

1187
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:07,309
I have nachos that
are in the broiler.

1188
00:54:07,342 --> 00:54:08,944
I have to go get them.

1189
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:10,947
Yeah, go. Do your thing.
I'll be here.

1190
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,349
-All right.
-All right.

1191
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:17,353
What are you doing out here by yourself?
Where's your boyfriend?

1192
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:19,655
No, I don't think he's
right for me. It's a pass.

1193
00:54:19,688 --> 00:54:22,391
He's so direct, you know.
There's no surprises there.

1194
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,493
There's not a lot
to discover.

1195
00:54:23,525 --> 00:54:25,927
It's nice to be...

1196
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,431
so physically, emotionally
attracted to someone.

1197
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:31,300
Yeah.

1198
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:32,701
But that's not what life is.

1199
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:37,739
Life is about challenges and shadows
and corners and feeling weird.

1200
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:40,309
You are so full of shit, that
I'm gonna buy you Pull-Ups.

1201
00:54:40,342 --> 00:54:41,710
I just think we're
gonna be very good friends.

1202
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:43,846
-I think you're being a little dramatic.
-I'm not.

1203
00:54:43,878 --> 00:54:45,882
I asked him if he
saw his parents die.

1204
00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:47,817
Jesus.

1205
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:49,951
-Yeah. I don't like this feeling.
-What feeling?

1206
00:54:49,985 --> 00:54:53,056
This high school feeling when
you're crushing on someone

1207
00:54:53,088 --> 00:54:55,391
and you're afraid that they're
not gonna like you back,

1208
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:56,793
and then you're
gonna get heart cramps.

1209
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,706
Hey, I think you're
getting ahead of yourself.

1210
00:54:59,728 --> 00:55:01,330
Someone else is
talking to him anyway.

1211
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,901
Brinda?

1212
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:08,705
Hail naw!

1213
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:11,373
Are you serious? Because I
am straight-up baffled.

1214
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:12,909
I'm sorry?

1215
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:16,411
I believe you called this party
a "sad and desperate event"?

1216
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:19,048
Well, I just figured I'd pop
in and say hello to everyone.

1217
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:20,750
I mean, we're all
adults now, right?

1218
00:55:20,782 --> 00:55:23,118
Nice try.
On your bike, bitch.

1219
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:25,355
Get your peanut butter
out of my sister's chocolate.

1220
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:26,722
Wow.

1221
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:29,958
I respect your jumpsuit,
but not its contents. Hit it.

1222
00:55:29,992 --> 00:55:32,362
Well, this is ludicrous.

1223
00:55:32,394 --> 00:55:35,063
Get out.

1224
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:38,768
Fine. I have another function
to attend anyway.

1225
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,603
Besides, I flushed
a tampon down your toilet.

1226
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:43,639
You're pads all the way
and everyone knows it.

1227
00:55:43,672 --> 00:55:44,606
Nuh.

1228
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,908
Let's go. Let's get
out of this septic tank.

1229
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:48,577
I kind of want
to stay a little.

1230
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:49,945
Yeah, me too.

1231
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:51,580
For serious?

1232
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:54,449
We never got to go before
because Kate hated you.

1233
00:55:54,483 --> 00:55:56,385
We suffered from
secondhand hate.

1234
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:01,124
Wow.

1235
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:08,430
Hi. You guys are welcome here.
You know that, right?

1236
00:56:08,463 --> 00:56:09,931
-Do you wanna do some shots?
-Yeah.

1237
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:12,369
Hi, I'd like to
make a noise complaint.

1238
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:17,472
Winter is coming, bitches.

1239
00:56:17,505 --> 00:56:18,907
-So, what's this order again?
-All right.

1240
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,442
It goes salt.

1241
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:22,412
Shot.

1242
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,946
And then
we suck on these?

1243
00:56:23,978 --> 00:56:25,181
No, you throw them
at each other.

1244
00:56:25,213 --> 00:56:26,748
That's the way
you're supposed to.

1245
00:56:26,782 --> 00:56:27,850
-Maura?
-That's what...

1246
00:56:27,882 --> 00:56:29,651
Some guy here to see you?

1247
00:56:29,684 --> 00:56:30,887
Excuse me.

1248
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,488
All right. Go do it.

1249
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:34,490
-My dude's in the bedroom.
-What dude?

1250
00:56:34,523 --> 00:56:35,191
Some kid we're
buying weed from.

1251
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:36,459
Ooh, okay.

1252
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,495
Hi, there.

1253
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:44,599
Holy mother.

1254
00:56:44,632 --> 00:56:47,469
That's right. This is my
best friend, my brah, right?

1255
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:48,738
This is Pazuzu.

1256
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:49,872
It sure is.

1257
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:53,208
Pazuzu. Thank you so much
for bringing your arms here.

1258
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:55,478
Your drugs here.

1259
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,547
Is your ink Samoan?
I saw a documentary once...

1260
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,715
I will handle this.

1261
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:03,786
We are looking for...
To buy drugs.

1262
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,788
What'chu want?

1263
00:57:06,822 --> 00:57:10,526
I got ketamine,
meth, MDMA, Adderall,

1264
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,964
Bromo-Dragonfly, heroin,
coke, crack, codeine, oxys,

1265
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:16,097
percs, vikes,

1266
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,967
PCP, LSD, Dilaudid, mescaline,

1267
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:22,138
mushrooms, bath salts,
cortisone, Toradol.

1268
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,806
I got molly. I got her sister Sandra.
I got big Frank.

1269
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,943
I got birth control.
I got Plan B.

1270
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:29,211
I got that morphine from China
they took off the market.

1271
00:57:29,244 --> 00:57:30,880
Shit to make
your dick hard.

1272
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:33,014
Shit to make your dick soft.
Shit'll find your dick.

1273
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:34,816
That shit there's
from Kenya.

1274
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:36,885
Supposed to be a scurvy cure
for silverback gorillas,

1275
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,054
but for humans, it just makes
them violently masturbate.

1276
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,590
Did I say crack? Because
I got more of that, too.

1277
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,025
You said
crack already.

1278
00:57:42,057 --> 00:57:44,594
I got some Ibuprofen, aspirin. I got
Flintstone Gummies if you want.

1279
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:45,695
You seem good at your job.

1280
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,697
-We don't need any of that. No.
-No.

1281
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:52,869
We're just gonna take some
low-level, late '80s dirt pot.

1282
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:55,170
You know, the kind with seeds in
it that you separate on a Frisbee.

1283
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:57,273
Something you smoke
at a Bangles concert.

1284
00:57:57,306 --> 00:58:00,306
I didn't drive my ass across town to
sell some moms some fucking dirt pot.

1285
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,045
Y'all gonna buy
some Cloud 10.

1286
00:58:03,077 --> 00:58:04,579
I'm sorry, man. They're
just new to the game.

1287
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:05,881
Ladies, come on.
This is Cloud 10.

1288
00:58:05,914 --> 00:58:07,150
This is the shiz, a'ight?

1289
00:58:07,182 --> 00:58:12,722
This is, like, 70% molly, 20%
Adderall, and it's 10% fun!

1290
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:14,023
You know what?
You seem like a pro,

1291
00:58:14,056 --> 00:58:16,559
so we'll just
take a little ohwheed

1292
00:58:16,592 --> 00:58:19,795
and just a skosh
of Cloud 10.

1293
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:21,063
Are there
hazelnuts in that?

1294
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:23,065
-I'll take the stuff for the dick.
-I got you.

1295
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:25,097
-I'll take this.
-Y'all mind if I hang out a bit?

1296
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,169
-Nah.
-Nah.

1297
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:29,238
-Please, please, please don't.
-Nuh.

1298
00:58:29,271 --> 00:58:30,907
-Don't stay... Stay. Yep.
-Thanks.

1299
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:40,883
Hey, you don't have any
Goldfish crackers up there?

1300
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,684
Don't mean to be coy.

1301
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:43,786
Hi, Alex.

1302
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:45,855
I'm just hiding this stevia.
That shit's expensive.

1303
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,255
Koi, goldfish.

1304
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:49,626
You.

1305
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,972
You know, you're the type of badass
that I was susceptible to in my youth.

1306
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:12,615
I used to make out with my
Stretch Armstrong doll,

1307
00:59:12,648 --> 00:59:16,219
so this is, like,
a full circle moment for me.

1308
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:22,759
Hey. Turn the music off!

1309
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,128
Everybody duck!

1310
00:59:27,128 --> 00:59:28,630
Quack, quack.

1311
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,305
Hi. We donated already.

1312
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:38,240
Hey. We received
a noise complaint?

1313
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:40,977
Officer, we are so sorry.
We'll shut everything down.

1314
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,378
No, it's...

1315
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:46,749
Wait a minute.
Your eyes are gorgeous.

1316
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:50,186
You know you look exactly like
an Affleck brother, right?

1317
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:53,088
I mean, it is like,
dead ringer times.

1318
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:54,990
Any underage
drinking going on?

1319
00:59:55,023 --> 00:59:56,826
-No. No.
-No.

1320
00:59:56,858 --> 00:59:58,059
Everybody's
double 21 in there.

1321
00:59:58,092 --> 00:59:59,694
Way over age.

1322
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:01,063
We had a 60-year-old
buy our beer.

1323
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:02,164
Well, you don't look
a day over 25.

1324
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:03,333
Thank you.

1325
01:00:04,932 --> 01:00:05,967
Thirty-five.

1326
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:09,368
Just do me a favor and act
your ages and keep it down?

1327
01:00:10,438 --> 01:00:11,973
We will keep it down.

1328
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:14,943
We will keep it so down,
like, below sea level.

1329
01:00:14,976 --> 01:00:16,277
-Nice teamwork.
-Yeah.

1330
01:00:16,311 --> 01:00:17,913
I miss flirting
with cops.

1331
01:00:17,945 --> 01:00:19,882
He was so afraid of us.

1332
01:00:19,914 --> 01:00:23,351
Motherfucker, titty-sucker,
two-balled bitch.

1333
01:00:23,385 --> 01:00:26,155
First PoPo of the night
thwarted by charm.

1334
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:28,923
Ellis Island, proceed, y'all!

1335
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,432
Hey. I put in a request
for our special song

1336
01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:39,402
so we can do
the Applebutt Jam.

1337
01:00:39,434 --> 01:00:42,672
I don't think we should do that tonight.
That's not that cool.

1338
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:45,074
No! Tonight is my night,
and it is cool,

1339
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:47,342
because we're doing it,
and we're cool.

1340
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:34,757
It's good, right?

1341
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,377
Whoo!

1342
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:02,050
Come here, peanut.

1343
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:05,153
Tell Mama what's freaking you
the fuck out about time.

1344
01:02:05,186 --> 01:02:06,989
I don't know.
It's just like...

1345
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:10,192
The other day,
I saw this old lady

1346
01:02:10,224 --> 01:02:12,327
looking at me through
a window on the street,

1347
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,263
and I felt bad
for her, you know?

1348
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:18,166
I waved at her,
and she waved back at me,

1349
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:21,870
and then I realized
that was just my reflection.

1350
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:28,043
It was just me and my
old beef jerky face.

1351
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:33,816
Why does time
do that to faces?

1352
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:34,951
Why?

1353
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:39,088
Don't do that.

1354
01:02:41,056 --> 01:02:44,492
When the time is right, smoke
this with your gentleman friend.

1355
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:47,862
I'm gonna make space cakes for the rest
of the gang like a goddamn June Cleaver

1356
01:02:47,896 --> 01:02:49,398
because I have
a domestic side.

1357
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:12,387
Look what fell
into my cleavage.

1358
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,356
Plinko! Jackpot!
Let's go.

1359
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:18,893
Ooh...

1360
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:23,900
Do you play any sports?

1361
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,369
Tennis,
for a little while.

1362
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,271
That's what
I was gonna guess.

1363
01:03:34,275 --> 01:03:35,827
Okay, Dribbles.
I got you, girl.

1364
01:03:35,828 --> 01:03:37,379
Hey.

1365
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,548
Let's go right in there.

1366
01:03:40,581 --> 01:03:43,351
Get you looking nice and clean
so you can throw up on it later.

1367
01:03:52,193 --> 01:03:55,063
You look like you naturally
have no body hair whatsoever.

1368
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:58,534
Do you oil yourself
up a lot?

1369
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,536
When I need to get
through a narrow shaft.

1370
01:04:00,568 --> 01:04:03,605
Danger. Walk away.
That's a black diamond slope.

1371
01:04:07,442 --> 01:04:09,277
Why ain't you partying?

1372
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:12,615
Because I'm the designated mom tonight.
I'm keeping everybody safe.

1373
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,517
Do you have kids?

1374
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,086
I'm sure I do.

1375
01:04:18,954 --> 01:04:19,989
Shit.

1376
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:25,994
Hey, Kate. You remember
when you scaled that

1377
01:04:26,027 --> 01:04:27,629
sucker right there
up to the last beam

1378
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,664
and you hollered,
"I'm the bomb!"

1379
01:04:29,697 --> 01:04:31,634
Like it was yesterday, yo.

1380
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:32,967
Well, come on, Kate.
What are you waiting for?

1381
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:34,470
Come on, everybody.
Kate, Kate!

1382
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,372
Kate, Kate, Kate!

1383
01:04:40,976 --> 01:04:44,079
When you're sober, it's kind of
like, "Why would anyone do this?"

1384
01:04:46,614 --> 01:04:48,383
Kate, Kate, Kate!

1385
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:52,153
Come on, Kate. Come on!

1386
01:04:52,186 --> 01:04:54,222
This is scary as shart.

1387
01:04:54,255 --> 01:04:55,490
How did I not die
doing this?

1388
01:04:55,523 --> 01:04:57,592
Don't try this.
This is not safe.

1389
01:04:57,626 --> 01:04:59,961
Somebody moved these bricks.

1390
01:04:59,994 --> 01:05:02,630
Hang tight, lady!

1391
01:05:02,664 --> 01:05:05,634
This is for
the fucking birds. Shitters.

1392
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:07,936
You guys.
You guys are gonna love this.

1393
01:05:07,969 --> 01:05:10,138
Don't move.
Stay right there.

1394
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,008
All right. Ready? Ready?

1395
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:15,611
Okay, guys,
can you guess who I am? Ready?

1396
01:05:15,643 --> 01:05:20,648
You wanna play rough? Okay. Say
hello to my little friend!

1397
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:22,583
-Cheech! No, Chong.
-No, no, no.

1398
01:05:22,617 --> 01:05:25,054
Say hello to my little friend!

1399
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:29,025
-Tim Allen.
-No.

1400
01:05:31,259 --> 01:05:35,463
Say hello to my little friend.
Bullets? Nothing.

1401
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:39,100
I love cocaine! Because I
have a scar on my face!

1402
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:51,579
It's stevia!
Psych!

1403
01:05:51,612 --> 01:05:53,048
It's stevia!

1404
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:02,158
Come on. You can get this!

1405
01:06:10,565 --> 01:06:14,369
So, if I read this,

1406
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:16,538
will I get, like, amazing
insight into who you are?

1407
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:18,406
-I am afraid so.
-Okay.

1408
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,543
Way behind the curtain.
Like, in the broom closet.

1409
01:06:21,576 --> 01:06:24,012
Well, I like broom closets.
Here we go.

1410
01:06:24,045 --> 01:06:26,047
"I tried tampons.

1411
01:06:26,081 --> 01:06:28,349
"No thanks, Tom Hanks."

1412
01:06:28,382 --> 01:06:30,385
"It felt like I fell
down hard on a Popsicle."

1413
01:06:30,418 --> 01:06:31,652
Man.

1414
01:06:31,686 --> 01:06:33,489
That's from last week.

1415
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,325
It's good stuff in here.

1416
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:37,426
It's my gift to you.

1417
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,494
I love it. I want more.

1418
01:06:39,527 --> 01:06:41,329
Now you tell me a secret.

1419
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:42,999
Okay.

1420
01:06:44,432 --> 01:06:46,635
I lost a whole bunch
of weight recently.

1421
01:06:46,668 --> 01:06:49,304
Like, 70 pounds.

1422
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:50,739
-Wow. That's great.
-Yeah, it's a lot.

1423
01:06:50,771 --> 01:06:52,607
All right,
tell me something else.

1424
01:06:56,744 --> 01:06:58,146
I got divorced.

1425
01:07:01,782 --> 01:07:04,386
So, you lost,
like, 200 pounds.

1426
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:12,228
Let's...

1427
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,195
You wanna try something?

1428
01:07:14,228 --> 01:07:15,396
Okay.

1429
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:20,302
On the count of three...

1430
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:23,338
let's say what
we're both afraid of.

1431
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:28,644
I mean,
unless you don't want to.

1432
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,445
No, I'm not afraid
to say it.

1433
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:33,548
-Okay?
-Okay, ready?

1434
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:35,284
One.

1435
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:36,418
Two.

1436
01:07:36,451 --> 01:07:37,519
Three.

1437
01:07:39,387 --> 01:07:41,222
-Alligators.
-Choking on a steak.

1438
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:44,559
Not great.

1439
01:07:48,396 --> 01:07:50,231
Let's really say
what we're afraid of.

1440
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,201
Like, for real.

1441
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:54,670
-Okay.
-Okay?

1442
01:07:58,672 --> 01:07:59,841
Ready?

1443
01:08:01,342 --> 01:08:04,745
One, two, three.

1444
01:08:04,778 --> 01:08:06,882
-I'm afraid that I'm boring...
-I'm afraid that losing weight...

1445
01:08:06,914 --> 01:08:09,250
-And I have too much baggage.
-Won't fix everything.

1446
01:08:15,623 --> 01:08:20,161
Did you lose weight to
gain self-confidence?

1447
01:08:20,494 --> 01:08:21,596
No.

1448
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:24,800
I think I lost the weight

1449
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:29,204
so I could gain a better view
of my perfect penis.

1450
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,999
I missed the little guy.
Not little.

1451
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,779
Medium.
I miss the medium guy.

1452
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:42,618
You are so not boring,
by the way.

1453
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,787
You've already
fixed so many things.

1454
01:08:47,788 --> 01:08:50,225
There used to be
so much stuff here.

1455
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:54,195
This attic made
me feel very safe.

1456
01:08:56,463 --> 01:08:58,367
Well, a house
is just a building.

1457
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:01,569
Home is a feeling.

1458
01:09:02,871 --> 01:09:04,573
-That's beautiful.
-Thank you.

1459
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:05,640
Who said that?

1460
01:09:05,673 --> 01:09:07,643
I did. Just now.

1461
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,255
-Were you shotgunning me?
-I am so sorry.

1462
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:22,858
-I misjudged the shotgun.
-I was going to.

1463
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:24,625
It's my fault.
I was showboating.

1464
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:26,862
I am so sorry
about that.

1465
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:28,664
You talking to me?

1466
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,332
Robert Pacino.

1467
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:34,336
Why don't you try sticking your
head up your ass? See if it fits?

1468
01:09:34,368 --> 01:09:35,603
What's the one...
Grimace?

1469
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:36,837
No.

1470
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:42,310
Why don't you try sticking
your head up your ass?

1471
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,845
Why don't you try sticking
your head up your ass?

1472
01:09:43,877 --> 01:09:46,280
See if it fits!
See if it fits!

1473
01:09:46,314 --> 01:09:48,483
Stevia!

1474
01:09:48,515 --> 01:09:50,518
Why don't you stick
your head up your ass?

1475
01:09:50,551 --> 01:09:52,453
-See if it fits?
-Pass.

1476
01:09:52,487 --> 01:09:54,722
Why don't you stick your head
up your ass and see if it fits?

1477
01:09:54,756 --> 01:09:56,391
<i>Scarface!</i>

1478
01:09:56,423 --> 01:09:58,260
<i>-Scarface.
-Scarface?</i>

1479
01:09:58,292 --> 01:09:59,393
Yes!

1480
01:09:59,426 --> 01:10:02,296
That's who I was
the whole fucking time!

1481
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:03,398
Awesome, man.

1482
01:10:04,832 --> 01:10:06,867
You got to want
it a little less.

1483
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,604
I can feel
my hair growing!

1484
01:10:09,637 --> 01:10:11,305
Alex, come on.

1485
01:10:11,338 --> 01:10:13,408
<i>Do you hear that?
It's Tipsy!</i>

1486
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,711
I love this song!
I got to dance. Here we go.

1487
01:10:17,612 --> 01:10:18,880
Hey, you backing it up!

1488
01:10:18,912 --> 01:10:20,414
This is your theme now.

1489
01:10:20,448 --> 01:10:21,650
Who, me? Or, e'rybody?

1490
01:10:21,682 --> 01:10:22,850
E'rybody.

1491
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:25,253
<i>'Cause e'rybody
got got to get tipsy</i>

1492
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:26,887
What?

1493
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:27,956
Yeah!

1494
01:10:27,988 --> 01:10:30,391
<i>E'rybody in the club get tipsy</i>

1495
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:33,262
Not just you.
Not just me. E'rybody.

1496
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:35,831
E'rybody. E'ry day,
e'ry hour, e'ry minute.

1497
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,002
My God!

1498
01:10:42,604 --> 01:10:44,840
God. Wait, come here. Come here.

1499
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:48,277
-Here we go.
-My dad's gonna murder me!

1500
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,313
Maura, look at me.
I can fix this.

1501
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:53,948
God. Go. Go, go, go.

1502
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:54,981
-Whoa!
-No, no, no!

1503
01:10:56,618 --> 01:10:58,553
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1504
01:10:58,586 --> 01:10:59,622
No!

1505
01:11:13,534 --> 01:11:14,702
I'm really

1506
01:11:15,703 --> 01:11:17,005
itchy.

1507
01:11:17,037 --> 01:11:18,572
It went up my nose.

1508
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:19,974
It went up my butt.

1509
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:21,710
Are we gonna die?

1510
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:23,743
No, this stuff's safe.
This is all from the '70s.

1511
01:11:24,712 --> 01:11:27,748
Wow! This is fucked up!

1512
01:11:33,954 --> 01:11:37,458
I wanna do that foam thing like
we saw at the Fart Mitzvah.

1513
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:45,766
Ooh!

1514
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,070
I need to talk
to you outside. Now.

1515
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:52,841
Well, let's do this. My earrings
are coming off, bohatch!

1516
01:11:52,873 --> 01:11:55,476
Why? You gonna hit me
with your long-ass earlobes?

1517
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:59,480
I have been waiting
a long time for this.

1518
01:12:01,716 --> 01:12:03,819
Hey!

1519
01:12:03,851 --> 01:12:04,853
Hey!

1520
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:07,323
Let me in!

1521
01:12:11,525 --> 01:12:13,127
This is bullshit!

1522
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,001
Hey.
How's everything going?

1523
01:12:21,034 --> 01:12:23,671
I'm crushing it.
How's the man-harvest going?

1524
01:12:23,704 --> 01:12:25,106
James is so hot.

1525
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,443
My high school heart cramp
has turned into a heart-on.

1526
01:12:28,475 --> 01:12:31,612
I have a heart-on for him.
I have a raging heart-on.

1527
01:12:31,645 --> 01:12:33,614
-I don't get it. Explain it more.
-I have a...

1528
01:12:33,648 --> 01:12:35,384
-Who the hell did that?
-I did.

1529
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:38,086
You are so badass!

1530
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:41,390
Fuck the Geernts!

1531
01:12:41,422 --> 01:12:42,657
Okay, I'm gonna
dive back in. Bye!

1532
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:44,024
Fucking party.

1533
01:12:51,032 --> 01:12:52,568
Jackpot.

1534
01:13:09,783 --> 01:13:12,019
Foam party!

1535
01:13:12,052 --> 01:13:14,655
Strip it down, town!

1536
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:17,626
Shit. It's my parents!

1537
01:13:17,658 --> 01:13:20,795
Shut the fuck up!
It's her parents!

1538
01:13:20,828 --> 01:13:25,000
Everyone, I'm gonna sneeze,
shut the fuck up!

1539
01:13:29,636 --> 01:13:30,671
Hello?

1540
01:13:30,704 --> 01:13:32,257
Hi!

1541
01:13:32,258 --> 01:13:33,809
You're home!
We're coming over.

1542
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:35,844
No, don't come over.

1543
01:13:35,877 --> 01:13:39,548
<i>We're just in our pj's
watching Risky Business.</i>

1544
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:44,653
Maura told us the wonderful news about
you and Haley moving to Orlando!

1545
01:13:45,552 --> 01:13:47,122
<i>And you got a job!</i>

1546
01:13:47,154 --> 01:13:49,157
Not hers to tell, but okay.

1547
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:51,826
<i>Your dad and I got an idea.</i>

1548
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:53,828
And we're only medium drunk.

1549
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,663
Could you headline
news it for me?

1550
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,032
<i>Yes.</i>

1551
01:13:57,064 --> 01:14:01,802
We are gonna give you 50% of the
money from the sale of the house

1552
01:14:01,836 --> 01:14:05,640
<i>and then we're gonna use the
other 50% to pay off the condo.</i>

1553
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:07,576
And we're leaving
Maura the stocks.

1554
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,212
<i>We thought that
you could use the money</i>

1555
01:14:10,244 --> 01:14:12,980
<i>to buy a little house
for you and Haley.</i>

1556
01:14:13,014 --> 01:14:15,016
Would I have to
pay the money back?

1557
01:14:15,048 --> 01:14:16,984
Or would it be more
of a "wink-wink" loan?

1558
01:14:17,018 --> 01:14:18,052
We're giving it to you.

1559
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:19,221
<i>For free.</i>

1560
01:14:19,253 --> 01:14:20,521
<i>As a love gift.</i>

1561
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:22,958
That solves a lot of things.

1562
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:26,261
Okay, I got to go now.
Thanks so much.

1563
01:14:26,293 --> 01:14:27,628
<i>Okle dokle.</i>

1564
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:29,764
Wash and dry any
tea cups you use,

1565
01:14:29,796 --> 01:14:31,866
and we're very
happy for you, honey.

1566
01:14:31,899 --> 01:14:32,967
Okay, thanks, bye!

1567
01:14:34,702 --> 01:14:36,204
Holy shit.

1568
01:14:44,878 --> 01:14:46,847
Holy shit.

1569
01:14:46,881 --> 01:14:48,750
Rob, Rob, Rob!

1570
01:14:50,784 --> 01:14:51,819
I'm the bomb!

1571
01:14:51,853 --> 01:14:53,622
I'm the bomb!

1572
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:56,757
I'm the bomb! I'm the bomb!

1573
01:15:02,997 --> 01:15:04,633
Okay, guys?

1574
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,735
I'm actually gonna
need everyone to just

1575
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,805
start cleaning up the area
where they're standing.

1576
01:15:18,246 --> 01:15:20,181
<i>Everybody, gather round, okay?</i>

1577
01:15:20,213 --> 01:15:21,853
<i>I just smoked some
21st century pot.</i>

1578
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:25,654
<i>-So I need to say my mind.
-Make it quick.</i>

1579
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:27,555
Release your boobs!

1580
01:15:27,588 --> 01:15:29,291
<i>No, my boobs are
sleeping right now.</i>

1581
01:15:29,323 --> 01:15:31,692
Six more weeks of winter!

1582
01:15:31,725 --> 01:15:35,729
<i>I wanna thank my sister, Kate,
for holding down the fort</i>

1583
01:15:35,762 --> 01:15:38,667
<i>and helping me have
the best night of my life.</i>

1584
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:40,068
<i>Wrapping it up.</i>

1585
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,635
<i>In the spirit
of my sister,</i>

1586
01:15:41,668 --> 01:15:46,041
<i>I encourage all of you to make
your mark on this house tonight.</i>

1587
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:47,241
<i>No, do not make your mark.</i>

1588
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,878
<i>Where's my handyman?</i>

1589
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:52,113
<i>Hey. I like that
you know who you are.</i>

1590
01:15:52,145 --> 01:15:54,248
<i>And that you ask
for what you want.</i>

1591
01:15:54,282 --> 01:15:56,351
<i>-And I think you're really cute.
-Thank you.</i>

1592
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:58,686
<i>But, whatever, dude. A lot of
people are cute, so relax.</i>

1593
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,755
Okay.

1594
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:01,989
<i>Anyway,
seriously, you guys.</i>

1595
01:16:02,023 --> 01:16:05,760
<i>Remember who you really are
and be that you!</i>

1596
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,762
<i>-Be that what?
-You!</i>

1597
01:16:08,796 --> 01:16:10,632
<i>-What that you?
-Be!</i>

1598
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:12,132
<i>Be what you?</i>

1599
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:13,101
That!

1600
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:14,636
You!

1601
01:16:14,668 --> 01:16:16,704
It's "that,"
it's fucking "be that you!"

1602
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:17,939
Be that you! Be that you!
Be that you!

1603
01:16:17,971 --> 01:16:19,306
All right,
don't yell at me.

1604
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:20,942
-I just did it three times!
-Don't yell at me!

1605
01:16:20,975 --> 01:16:22,110
Who's yelling?

1606
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,377
<i>One more time. Be what you?</i>

1607
01:16:23,411 --> 01:16:24,980
That!

1608
01:16:25,012 --> 01:16:26,614
You got it! I'm out.

1609
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,286
<i>Thank you.
Good night. We are closed.</i>

1610
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:33,155
<i>Take the party outside!</i>

1611
01:16:36,256 --> 01:16:37,091
No, that way.

1612
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,792
Guys, that way!

1613
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:46,668
I liked your speech.

1614
01:16:46,701 --> 01:16:48,336
I'm meeting you
in the bedroom.

1615
01:16:48,368 --> 01:16:50,404
I'm going in there
to fix the drywall.

1616
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:54,074
Okay. Okay.

1617
01:16:54,108 --> 01:16:55,911
-Excuse me, please.
-Excuse me.

1618
01:16:58,378 --> 01:17:01,216
Alex, take your dick out of
the paint, right this minute!

1619
01:17:01,248 --> 01:17:03,751
No! I'm gonna draw suh-in!

1620
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,855
I'm like a little
Pablo Dickasso!

1621
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:10,859
Hey, man.
I got you. Shit!

1622
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:17,364
Yes, my neighbors are having a loud
party, and I'd like to complain.

1623
01:17:17,398 --> 01:17:19,300
I need you to shut it down.

1624
01:17:20,868 --> 01:17:21,936
Man.

1625
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:23,872
Who called the cops?

1626
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:27,008
Having a pretty
big party?

1627
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:29,244
Is 500 people too much?

1628
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,078
PoPo! PoPo!

1629
01:17:31,112 --> 01:17:33,248
Somebody call
a stripper?

1630
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,949
You gonna take your clothes off for us?
You can't come in here.

1631
01:17:35,983 --> 01:17:38,086
-Without the judge signing the thing.
-I got this.

1632
01:17:38,118 --> 01:17:39,420
This is where I live.

1633
01:17:39,453 --> 01:17:40,788
-This is our house.
-Yep.

1634
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,891
This where we live, okay?

1635
01:17:42,923 --> 01:17:45,126
And this is our property
for the next 24 hours.

1636
01:17:45,158 --> 01:17:47,394
A lot of sex is gonna happen.
A lot of sexy times.

1637
01:17:47,427 --> 01:17:49,096
You can't stop that.

1638
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:51,065
Last time I checked,
sex wasn't against the law,

1639
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:53,134
as much as you would
love that, wouldn't you?

1640
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:54,803
-Maura, please behave.
-Why don't you step off, blue?

1641
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,005
<i>Don't you know
I'm loco? Shit!</i>

1642
01:17:57,037 --> 01:17:58,272
Now we know that.

1643
01:17:58,305 --> 01:17:59,206
Officer Donuts.

1644
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,109
Why don't you go
back into your squad car

1645
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:02,777
and go save
a kitten from a tree,

1646
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:04,846
because these
pussies are doing fine.

1647
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:07,181
So, wrap your mind
around that, Cap'n Crunch.

1648
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:08,850
Capeach?

1649
01:18:08,882 --> 01:18:10,885
I know something about you.
You're a nice person, right?

1650
01:18:10,917 --> 01:18:15,122
And you look like a Ken doll, hopefully
with the genitals. Fingers crossed.

1651
01:18:15,155 --> 01:18:18,092
You've picked a very great profession.
And I salute you.

1652
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,966
But you know what?
This is how I'll salute you.

1653
01:18:19,993 --> 01:18:22,096
Like this. I'm sorry.

1654
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,264
Wait, that didn't happen,
nobody saw that.

1655
01:18:23,296 --> 01:18:24,765
I got this.

1656
01:18:24,798 --> 01:18:26,167
-What are you writing down?
-Nothing. It's my pad.

1657
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:27,367
Here, I have something
you should write down.

1658
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,903
E-A-T.

1659
01:18:30,104 --> 01:18:31,405
S-H-I-T.

1660
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:35,476
Okay, my sister is clearly riding
the ditch at this late hour.

1661
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,011
Can you shut this shit down?

1662
01:18:37,043 --> 01:18:38,412
Was that Maura Ellis?

1663
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:39,480
Yeah.

1664
01:18:40,981 --> 01:18:42,751
She went to
the sophomore formal

1665
01:18:42,783 --> 01:18:44,085
with my cousin
who has spina bifida.

1666
01:18:44,118 --> 01:18:46,054
Of course she did!

1667
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:49,023
She is a lovely person.
He still talks about it.

1668
01:18:49,055 --> 01:18:50,357
-Yeah.
-You know what?

1669
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:53,260
You guys enjoy your party.

1670
01:18:53,293 --> 01:18:54,996
No. No, no.

1671
01:18:55,029 --> 01:18:56,064
No. No! Wait!

1672
01:18:56,096 --> 01:19:00,001
There's a drunk, blind guy
swinging a gun around!

1673
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:01,368
No way. Enjoy!

1674
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:03,171
Fuck!

1675
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,310
Hey.

1676
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:11,913
How's it going in here?

1677
01:19:11,945 --> 01:19:13,413
Good, I think.

1678
01:19:13,447 --> 01:19:15,250
Yeah, I think you're all set.

1679
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,552
I'm gonna have to come back
tomorrow and finish this,

1680
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:21,956
because I am drunk
and stoned.

1681
01:19:21,988 --> 01:19:23,524
-Well, I'm totally sober, so.
-Yeah.

1682
01:19:23,557 --> 01:19:24,993
I did a really bad job.

1683
01:19:25,025 --> 01:19:27,461
You're very tall.
How tall are you?

1684
01:19:27,494 --> 01:19:31,498
About 6'3". With the
ladder, about 7'6".

1685
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:33,967
So, I'm just gonna...

1686
01:19:34,001 --> 01:19:35,837
Thanks so much for
cleaning this all up.

1687
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:37,970
Yeah.

1688
01:19:39,974 --> 01:19:43,144
Do you wanna keep
working off the clock?

1689
01:19:43,176 --> 01:19:45,212
-Yeah.
-Because my bed is broken.

1690
01:19:45,246 --> 01:19:46,314
Do you want me to fix it?

1691
01:19:46,346 --> 01:19:47,346
Yeah. Lock the door.

1692
01:19:49,483 --> 01:19:53,020
People, I'm in charge here,
and I say it's over.

1693
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:56,257
Okay? We had a great time.
Let's wrap it up.

1694
01:19:56,289 --> 01:19:57,289
No!

1695
01:19:58,292 --> 01:20:00,495
Why? What?

1696
01:20:03,463 --> 01:20:05,199
This is such
a brilliant idea!

1697
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,233
Free slicking.

1698
01:20:08,502 --> 01:20:11,106
I wish we had
some lubricant.

1699
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,475
What perfume is on you?

1700
01:20:14,507 --> 01:20:15,842
-You like that?
-Yeah, I do.

1701
01:20:15,876 --> 01:20:20,480
It's Risky by Jennifer Love Hewitt.
You can only get it at Kohl's.

1702
01:20:20,514 --> 01:20:23,984
I'm wearing
Erection by Calvin Klein.

1703
01:20:24,018 --> 01:20:27,588
I cannot!

1704
01:20:30,123 --> 01:20:33,994
What did I ever do to you
to make you abhor me so?

1705
01:20:34,028 --> 01:20:35,496
Are you seriously asking?

1706
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:36,931
You probably
don't remember.

1707
01:20:36,963 --> 01:20:38,099
I remember.

1708
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:41,268
We were about to have the
best Ellis Island party ever

1709
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:44,137
because my cousin met John Stamos
at Disney and he was coming.

1710
01:20:44,171 --> 01:20:47,008
But you narced
to your cop dad.

1711
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:48,909
I narced because
he made me!

1712
01:20:48,943 --> 01:20:50,945
How? How did he even know?

1713
01:20:50,978 --> 01:20:54,215
Because when I found out that I
wasn't invited to your party

1714
01:20:54,247 --> 01:20:58,485
it hurt me so very deep,
that I threw up really hard.

1715
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:00,387
Why didn't you invite me?

1716
01:21:02,923 --> 01:21:04,426
Why?

1717
01:21:05,292 --> 01:21:07,527
I was kind and clean!

1718
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,063
And I got mostly B's!

1719
01:21:09,095 --> 01:21:10,330
I know, I cheated off you.

1720
01:21:10,363 --> 01:21:13,201
And then you decided
that I was a "no."

1721
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:16,304
And then everybody decided
that I was a "no"!

1722
01:21:16,337 --> 01:21:19,674
And then guess who decided
that I was a "no"?

1723
01:21:19,707 --> 01:21:21,242
<i>The Bachelor?</i>

1724
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:23,310
Me.

1725
01:21:23,344 --> 01:21:27,948
So, I have decided that
tonight I deserve to be here.

1726
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:31,987
Tonight, I am a "yes."

1727
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:35,657
I am a "hell yes"!

1728
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:38,358
I am a "yeah."

1729
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:40,427
I am a "hell yeah."

1730
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:42,497
I am a "fuck to the yeah"!

1731
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:43,797
Wordsmith.

1732
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:45,065
I am a "yippie-ki-yay yes"!

1733
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,668
And you know what
the saddest part is?

1734
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:49,003
Your vagina?

1735
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:50,104
No.

1736
01:21:50,136 --> 01:21:52,506
The saddest part

1737
01:21:52,539 --> 01:21:55,409
is that you and I used to
have a blast in grade school.

1738
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,979
And we would probably
still be friends

1739
01:21:58,011 --> 01:22:01,048
if you weren't such
a selfish hothead.

1740
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:05,420
I am not a selfish hothead!

1741
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:07,255
-Put that phone down! Give me that.
-No!

1742
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:08,488
Give me that phone!
Give me that!

1743
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:10,057
No! Don't touch my phone.

1744
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:11,526
Maura! Maura!

1745
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:18,599
Hi, honey.

1746
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:20,467
<i>Hi, Mom, I'm here.</i>

1747
01:22:20,501 --> 01:22:22,003
I'm at Gram and Gramps'.

1748
01:22:22,036 --> 01:22:23,504
You're here?
In Orlando?

1749
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:24,972
Yeah.

1750
01:22:25,006 --> 01:22:27,307
Great. Okay.

1751
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:29,477
<i>They told me that they're
gonna help us get a house.</i>

1752
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:31,646
Do you want me to come down
there and we can talk about it?

1753
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:35,315
We're all pretty
wiped from packing.

1754
01:22:35,349 --> 01:22:36,717
You know, I would say maybe
just get some rest and...

1755
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,987
So come over
in the morning.

1756
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,489
<i>Wait. You want me to come
there in the morning?</i>

1757
01:22:41,521 --> 01:22:43,457
You have been begging me for
weeks to tell you where I am,

1758
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:45,158
and now that I'm here
you're gonna blow me off?

1759
01:22:45,192 --> 01:22:46,659
<i>No, I'm not blowing you off!</i>

1760
01:22:46,694 --> 01:22:49,097
I'm so excited! We're getting a house,
and you're gonna have your own room.

1761
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,265
I got a baloney dick!

1762
01:22:51,297 --> 01:22:53,068
-Who has a baloney dick?
-Nobody.

1763
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:56,203
Are you at
a party right now?

1764
01:22:57,337 --> 01:23:00,041
Earlier. We had
a packing cookout.

1765
01:23:00,073 --> 01:23:02,743
Cookout
with your cock out.

1766
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:04,045
I'm on the phone!

1767
01:23:04,078 --> 01:23:06,114
You say that
you want a fresh start

1768
01:23:06,146 --> 01:23:08,750
and everyone
is trying to help us out,

1769
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:11,219
<i>and this is how
you thank them?</i>

1770
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:13,621
-It's not what you think.
-No, it's exactly what I think.

1771
01:23:13,654 --> 01:23:15,790
I start trusting you again
and then you turn around

1772
01:23:15,823 --> 01:23:18,593
<i>and you start acting like one of the
Real Housewives of Orange County.</i>

1773
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:21,262
Can you just give me a chance
to make it right?

1774
01:23:21,295 --> 01:23:23,455
No! I don't wanna live
with my loser mom who parties.

1775
01:23:25,365 --> 01:23:28,285
You know what? Tonight, I'm actually
the only person who's not partying.

1776
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,438
Yeah, right.

1777
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,114
Fuck it.

1778
01:23:43,216 --> 01:23:45,219
<i>Kate! Kate! Kate!</i>

1779
01:24:11,377 --> 01:24:14,414
Hey. Lollapazuzu,
I'm partying now.

1780
01:24:14,448 --> 01:24:15,483
You ready for me?

1781
01:24:15,515 --> 01:24:17,217
I've been ready.

1782
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:19,454
My safe word
is "Keep going."

1783
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,389
-I don't need one.
-You will.

1784
01:24:23,657 --> 01:24:24,826
I don't have insurance.

1785
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:01,362
You have such
a good, solid, man face.

1786
01:25:01,395 --> 01:25:03,231
-I'm gonna do stuff to you right now.
-You are?

1787
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,332
-Yes.
-Okay.

1788
01:25:04,364 --> 01:25:05,465
Put your pants off.
I'm sorry.

1789
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:07,167
I meant to say that
a little smoother

1790
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:08,735
but I'm very, very drunk,
plus stoned. Let's go.

1791
01:25:08,769 --> 01:25:10,805
Just open up your parts.
Put your pants off.

1792
01:25:10,837 --> 01:25:12,472
No, no, no. I'm putting
them off right now.

1793
01:25:12,506 --> 01:25:13,841
-Yep, here we go.
-Yeah!

1794
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,515
You have kids?

1795
01:25:20,547 --> 01:25:24,219
Two girls in Korea.
I miss them bad.

1796
01:25:24,618 --> 01:25:26,320
So far.

1797
01:25:26,353 --> 01:25:30,291
I put their hairs
in my bra.

1798
01:25:30,323 --> 01:25:33,527
I miss how my daughter smells
when she has wet hair.

1799
01:25:34,728 --> 01:25:36,163
She die?

1800
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,597
No.

1801
01:25:37,631 --> 01:25:40,768
I haven't been able to find
her, like, all summer.

1802
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:42,737
That is fucked up.

1803
01:25:52,712 --> 01:25:53,715
You wanna hug?

1804
01:25:57,217 --> 01:25:59,319
Yeah, give this
messy bitch a hug.

1805
01:25:59,353 --> 01:26:01,655
Katie, what's
the matter, baby?

1806
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:04,892
Aw, look at you. Don't cry.
It's gonna make me cry.

1807
01:26:04,925 --> 01:26:07,929
People are really working
their shit out at this thing.

1808
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:09,797
This is like
Korean drama.

1809
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,333
Heads up! Whoo!

1810
01:26:29,015 --> 01:26:30,451
You're out of booze.

1811
01:26:31,351 --> 01:26:33,287
I'm on it.

1812
01:26:34,287 --> 01:26:36,423
Party mom
to the rescue.

1813
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:37,959
Okay, we're gonna
get started in one second.

1814
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:39,260
Okay.

1815
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:41,529
Hello.

1816
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:43,698
Hey, you're number one.

1817
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:45,332
Okay, let's
take it up a notch.

1818
01:26:45,365 --> 01:26:46,884
Okay, you know
what time it is?

1819
01:26:46,885 --> 01:26:48,402
No.

1820
01:26:48,435 --> 01:26:50,371
It's candle play time.

1821
01:26:51,971 --> 01:26:55,408
I should warn you
that this did not go well

1822
01:26:55,442 --> 01:26:57,377
when I was having sex
with Frankenstein.

1823
01:26:58,444 --> 01:26:59,479
Fire bad.

1824
01:26:59,512 --> 01:27:00,747
Yeah, I'm ready.

1825
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:05,019
I didn't think...
That's wild. That's wild.

1826
01:27:05,051 --> 01:27:07,387
God. I didn't think I was
gonna like it, but I like it.

1827
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:08,623
How does this
sucker not stay lit?

1828
01:27:08,655 --> 01:27:10,890
Okay.
Hold the sex phone.

1829
01:27:10,923 --> 01:27:12,726
All right.
Just getting into it.

1830
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,462
Look who
we have here.

1831
01:27:14,494 --> 01:27:16,264
Garfield!

1832
01:27:16,296 --> 01:27:17,597
-Garfield always comes through.
-Yeah, he's...

1833
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:19,334
-He's gonna help us out.
-God!

1834
01:27:20,701 --> 01:27:21,703
God!

1835
01:27:22,469 --> 01:27:23,471
Shit. Fuck!

1836
01:27:23,703 --> 01:27:25,472
No! Shit!

1837
01:27:29,076 --> 01:27:30,677
My God!

1838
01:27:34,414 --> 01:27:35,783
Fuck!

1839
01:27:35,815 --> 01:27:37,585
-Did you fall on something sharp?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1840
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:41,455
Okay, did it go up inside of
you by way of your rectum?

1841
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:42,890
Yeah, I think so.

1842
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:47,894
It feels like a small trophy or...
A collectible.

1843
01:27:47,927 --> 01:27:50,965
James, I am a nurse. Okay?

1844
01:27:50,997 --> 01:27:53,433
I can get whatever
is up there out.

1845
01:27:53,466 --> 01:27:55,603
No, I don't
want you to look.

1846
01:27:55,636 --> 01:27:58,773
It's not Maura, the woman that you
were kissing who's gonna look.

1847
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:00,674
-It's a nurse who just got here.
-Okay.

1848
01:28:00,707 --> 01:28:03,411
Hello, sir. Nice to meet
you for the first time.

1849
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,379
Okay. All right.
Okay.

1850
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:08,316
I'm just gonna roll you over
so I can examine your rectum.

1851
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:10,717
Okay. Stop.
Stop saying rectum.

1852
01:28:10,751 --> 01:28:13,387
-I'm gonna get it out, whatever it is.
-Okay.

1853
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:15,588
So I'm just gonna twist it,
and pull it out slowly.

1854
01:28:15,622 --> 01:28:16,658
Just breathe.

1855
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:22,997
It's a music box.

1856
01:28:24,398 --> 01:28:26,000
Yep.

1857
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:29,003
It's my ballerina
music box.

1858
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:32,373
And she's in high-fifth position,
which is why she went in so easily.

1859
01:28:32,405 --> 01:28:33,940
Okay.

1860
01:28:33,974 --> 01:28:36,878
Is it past the tutu?

1861
01:28:39,145 --> 01:28:40,480
Yeah.

1862
01:28:40,514 --> 01:28:42,550
That's why
it's catching.

1863
01:28:42,582 --> 01:28:44,818
So, okay, James,
I'm gonna try something here.

1864
01:28:44,851 --> 01:28:46,487
-No. Nah, I'm good.
-It's okay.

1865
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:47,822
I know, I know.
Just give me a second.

1866
01:28:47,854 --> 01:28:48,855
Okay, hold on!

1867
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:52,093
That's turning inside me!
Just let it wind down.

1868
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:05,873
I think it's almost done.

1869
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:08,542
It's Swiss-made,
so it may take a while.

1870
01:29:10,176 --> 01:29:12,679
How long
is this fucking song?

1871
01:29:12,712 --> 01:29:14,914
It really is
a beautiful melody.

1872
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:17,552
Beethoven. What a...
What a genius.

1873
01:29:20,854 --> 01:29:23,724
And we're do... Nope.

1874
01:29:23,756 --> 01:29:25,492
-It went around again.
-Yeah.

1875
01:29:25,525 --> 01:29:27,427
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna hop up.

1876
01:29:27,461 --> 01:29:29,764
-Okay. You got it?
-Yeah, I got it. Yeah, no, no.

1877
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:31,931
It didn't happen.
It never happened.

1878
01:29:31,965 --> 01:29:33,601
James, seriously.

1879
01:29:33,634 --> 01:29:35,970
Be gentle.
Be very, very careful.

1880
01:29:36,002 --> 01:29:38,639
-I'm gonna borrow this.
-Let's not make this the headline of the night.

1881
01:29:38,671 --> 01:29:39,939
We are gonna laugh
about this someday.

1882
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,976
You know, that is not the worst
rectal accident I've ever seen.

1883
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:44,512
Thanks for that.

1884
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:46,846
Thanks for cleaning up
the fucking gel, Kate!

1885
01:29:48,815 --> 01:29:50,451
Holy shit.

1886
01:29:50,484 --> 01:29:52,053
-Help me wash it off.
-Yeah?

1887
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:54,055
Kate?

1888
01:29:55,021 --> 01:29:56,122
Has anyone seen my sister?

1889
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:58,793
She's sober and she needs to
drive us to the hospital.

1890
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:01,628
I think
I got the gangrene.

1891
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,898
I might have
fucked a copy machine!

1892
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:05,098
Good Lord.

1893
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:06,466
Are you okay?

1894
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,603
I swallowed
my wedding ring!

1895
01:30:11,637 --> 01:30:12,872
Where's my purse?

1896
01:30:23,182 --> 01:30:27,621
<i>Hey, Aunt Maura. I just landed in Orlando!
Thanks for our conversation.</i>

1897
01:30:27,654 --> 01:30:30,658
<i>I'm glad you talked me into coming down.
I do trust you.</i>

1898
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:32,225
<i>I set the alarm at your condo,</i>

1899
01:30:32,259 --> 01:30:35,162
<i>and I gave my keys to your
pet-sitter, like you told me.</i>

1900
01:30:35,194 --> 01:30:38,632
<i>And I sent you a picture of me and Polenta.
She misses you.</i>

1901
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:45,772
Hell no.

1902
01:30:45,805 --> 01:30:48,107
Where is my purse?
Have you seen it anywhere?

1903
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,143
It was just here.

1904
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,515
Shit.

1905
01:30:54,547 --> 01:30:56,583
More stevia!

1906
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,217
Cloud Nine didn't
have this glitch in it.

1907
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:00,654
Hey! Calm down.

1908
01:31:01,921 --> 01:31:02,921
Steamroller!

1909
01:31:03,556 --> 01:31:04,791
Steamroller!

1910
01:31:06,059 --> 01:31:07,695
Santa, help me!

1911
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:18,739
Okay, good night.

1912
01:31:18,771 --> 01:31:19,891
Good night,
sweet prince.

1913
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:26,746
James!

1914
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,016
James.

1915
01:31:30,783 --> 01:31:32,519
James, let me
get you to a hospital.

1916
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:33,820
-No, I'm all right.
-The thing is...

1917
01:31:33,854 --> 01:31:35,822
Maura, thank you for your help,
but I know what's best for me.

1918
01:31:35,855 --> 01:31:37,224
And right now...

1919
01:31:37,256 --> 01:31:40,193
I think I need to be
alone with my asshole.

1920
01:31:40,226 --> 01:31:41,695
-Okay.
-Good night, Maura.

1921
01:31:43,095 --> 01:31:46,165
I need more stevia!

1922
01:31:46,198 --> 01:31:47,534
Where's Kate?

1923
01:31:47,568 --> 01:31:49,537
She went to
go get booze.

1924
01:31:49,569 --> 01:31:50,704
She was pretty drunk.

1925
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:52,173
Say hello
to my little friend!

1926
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:53,608
Of course she was.

1927
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:59,279
Let's get
this party started!

1928
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,249
He's on Cloud 10!

1929
01:32:04,016 --> 01:32:05,653
I'm Alex.

1930
01:32:05,685 --> 01:32:08,188
We are going to dance floor
to dance out the rat poison.

1931
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,589
What the fuck?

1932
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:16,421
Hey. I'm sorry. Hold on one second.
Hold on one second.

1933
01:32:16,796 --> 01:32:18,197
-Mom?
-My God!

1934
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:19,265
Yeah,
I'll be right there.

1935
01:32:19,298 --> 01:32:20,333
I'm kidding!

1936
01:32:23,069 --> 01:32:26,740
But thanks for finally laughing,
you fucking assholes!

1937
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,247
I'm gonna kill her!

1938
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:37,150
Where's my sister?

1939
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:40,720
Kate!

1940
01:32:40,753 --> 01:32:41,921
Girl fight!

1941
01:32:41,954 --> 01:32:43,023
Maura!

1942
01:32:43,055 --> 01:32:44,357
-Kate!
-Maura!

1943
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:45,759
Girl fight!

1944
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:46,792
Where's my sister?

1945
01:32:48,694 --> 01:32:49,796
Girl fight!

1946
01:33:02,341 --> 01:33:03,344
Go, go, go!

1947
01:33:20,193 --> 01:33:21,996
We did it, you guys.

1948
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:23,798
We stopped time!

1949
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,703
It's snowing!

1950
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:31,338
Yes! Yes!

1951
01:33:36,842 --> 01:33:38,412
My God.
You guys.

1952
01:33:38,444 --> 01:33:39,646
Sinkhole!

1953
01:33:50,423 --> 01:33:52,259
Shit!

1954
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:53,427
Look at this!

1955
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:54,962
My God.

1956
01:33:54,994 --> 01:33:56,296
My God!

1957
01:33:56,328 --> 01:33:57,730
My God!

1958
01:33:57,764 --> 01:33:59,699
There's a sinkhole.
There's a sinkhole.

1959
01:33:59,733 --> 01:34:01,034
Look at this.

1960
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:02,770
You told me you were gonna
take care of things

1961
01:34:02,802 --> 01:34:04,304
and you let
everything go to shit.

1962
01:34:04,337 --> 01:34:05,538
Where did you go?

1963
01:34:05,572 --> 01:34:08,175
You were supposed to stay sober.
I was supposed to get laid!

1964
01:34:08,207 --> 01:34:09,777
Where's my daughter, Maura?

1965
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:11,712
Do you know?

1966
01:34:12,979 --> 01:34:14,148
No.

1967
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,782
Look me in the eyes.

1968
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,721
I don't know
where she is.

1969
01:34:20,753 --> 01:34:23,356
You've always been
a fucking terrible liar.

1970
01:34:23,390 --> 01:34:25,693
Where is my
daughter, Maura?

1971
01:34:25,725 --> 01:34:27,293
She has been staying
with me in Atlanta.

1972
01:34:27,327 --> 01:34:28,362
Since when?

1973
01:34:29,328 --> 01:34:30,331
June.

1974
01:34:31,497 --> 01:34:33,966
June.

1975
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,337
You watched me worry
about her like an idiot,

1976
01:34:37,369 --> 01:34:40,940
fucking texting her every day, and
freaking out about her every day.

1977
01:34:40,974 --> 01:34:42,909
And she was living
with you the whole time?

1978
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:44,445
Okay, but the thing is,
she didn't want you to know.

1979
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:47,280
You're my sister! You should
have told me she was safe!

1980
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:51,085
She is. She was!
The thing is, Haley needs...

1981
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:54,021
Don't tell me what my
daughter needs, okay?

1982
01:34:54,054 --> 01:34:55,823
Why don't you go
breastfeed a squirrel?

1983
01:34:57,923 --> 01:34:58,958
Shit!

1984
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:07,100
This reminds me of that movie
we watched on our anniversary.

1985
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:12,372
My hip, my hip!

1986
01:35:12,404 --> 01:35:13,407
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1987
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:14,907
-Can you move it?
-Yeah.

1988
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:17,176
Good, because
I'm gonna kill you!

1989
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,480
I really hope
Maura cracks her in half.

1990
01:35:19,512 --> 01:35:21,247
Come on, Maura!

1991
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,448
Don't you spit on me.

1992
01:35:22,481 --> 01:35:23,949
-Why are you hitting yourself?
-Not cool!

1993
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:27,922
Wait a second. I'm posting this shit
straight on PoolsideBitchFights.com.

1994
01:35:29,488 --> 01:35:30,823
Kick her in the tits!

1995
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:32,460
Haley is my kid,
not yours!

1996
01:35:33,993 --> 01:35:35,128
God damn it!

1997
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:36,764
What have you
done to our house?

1998
01:35:36,796 --> 01:35:39,298
Stop that
mud wrestling now!

1999
01:35:39,332 --> 01:35:40,901
Mom, leave
Aunt Maura alone.

2000
01:35:40,934 --> 01:35:42,269
I was doing just fine
living with her.

2001
01:35:42,301 --> 01:35:43,469
I mean, ask
Gram and Gramps.

2002
01:35:43,502 --> 01:35:46,239
You guys knew all along that
she was living with Maura?

2003
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:48,542
You lying mofos!

2004
01:35:48,574 --> 01:35:50,144
I'm gonna kill you.

2005
01:35:50,176 --> 01:35:52,411
Stop it. Stop it!
We are fed up.

2006
01:35:52,444 --> 01:35:54,313
We have no energy
for this goddamn shit.

2007
01:35:54,346 --> 01:35:56,315
-Smell that armpit.
-Stop!

2008
01:35:56,349 --> 01:35:58,385
Our whole house looks like Pompeii,
and you two are wrestling?

2009
01:35:58,417 --> 01:35:59,987
I'll tell you what.

2010
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,890
Since we're all finally
telling the goddamn truth,

2011
01:36:02,922 --> 01:36:04,291
here's our truth.

2012
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:07,161
And we mean this from the
bottom of our hearts.

2013
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:10,831
We are so tired
of the both of you.

2014
01:36:10,863 --> 01:36:13,866
We're so tired.
We really are.

2015
01:36:13,899 --> 01:36:15,469
You know, everybody
always said to us...

2016
01:36:15,502 --> 01:36:19,573
"Enjoy your kids while they're
young because it goes so fast."

2017
01:36:19,605 --> 01:36:22,108
I don't know what the fuck
they were talking about,

2018
01:36:22,141 --> 01:36:24,877
because it seems like
we'll never be done.

2019
01:36:24,911 --> 01:36:27,381
We keep trying
to pass you the baton.

2020
01:36:27,413 --> 01:36:29,115
You won't take it.

2021
01:36:29,149 --> 01:36:30,484
Take it!

2022
01:36:30,516 --> 01:36:34,520
Just take
the fucking baton!

2023
01:36:34,554 --> 01:36:37,490
I agree. We all think you
should take the baton, Kate.

2024
01:36:37,524 --> 01:36:39,459
Maura, cut the shit.
We're talking to you, too.

2025
01:36:39,492 --> 01:36:40,493
Me?

2026
01:36:40,494 --> 01:36:41,494
Yeah, you.

2027
01:36:41,528 --> 01:36:43,297
Go and live your life

2028
01:36:43,329 --> 01:36:46,600
and stop following us around
like we're gonna die any minute.

2029
01:36:46,632 --> 01:36:48,234
Yeah, we probably
have more sex

2030
01:36:48,268 --> 01:36:49,837
-than the both of you.
-Yeah.

2031
01:36:49,869 --> 01:36:51,572
-We know!
-Yeah. We interrupted one of your day-bangs.

2032
01:36:51,604 --> 01:36:53,206
My God!

2033
01:36:53,239 --> 01:36:54,541
You know,
if it takes a village...

2034
01:36:54,573 --> 01:36:57,176
I want a different village,
because this one sucks!

2035
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:59,279
Why can't you guys
just be...

2036
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:04,585
-Haley!
-Haley!

2037
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:06,119
-God.
-Shit!

2038
01:37:06,152 --> 01:37:07,988
-Sweet Jesus!
-Haley!

2039
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:09,155
-Haley?
-Mom!

2040
01:37:09,189 --> 01:37:10,324
-Bucky, do something!
-Haley!

2041
01:37:10,356 --> 01:37:11,390
Haley!

2042
01:37:13,326 --> 01:37:14,895
-Shit!
-Kate!

2043
01:37:16,095 --> 01:37:17,897
This party
is unbelievable.

2044
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:21,934
I am not going in to work tomorrow.
TSA can kiss my ass.

2045
01:37:21,967 --> 01:37:25,238
Kate, I've been through this shit
before when my condo sankholed.

2046
01:37:25,271 --> 01:37:27,039
I'm gonna
talk you through it.

2047
01:37:27,073 --> 01:37:29,343
Your first instinct
is gonna be

2048
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:31,345
just to go to sleep and deal
with it in the morning,

2049
01:37:31,377 --> 01:37:32,445
but don't do that.

2050
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:33,579
-I got a ladder.
-Kate!

2051
01:37:33,613 --> 01:37:34,648
-Is it cold?
-Yes, it's fucking cold!

2052
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,148
-Hush!
-It looks cold.

2053
01:37:36,181 --> 01:37:38,885
Everyone's distracted
by the emergency right now.

2054
01:37:38,918 --> 01:37:41,320
I wanna be
balls deep in joy.

2055
01:37:41,354 --> 01:37:43,257
Then be in it.

2056
01:37:43,289 --> 01:37:44,289
Back into me.

2057
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:47,060
Backing into you.

2058
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:53,432
I'm in. Lock it up.

2059
01:37:53,466 --> 01:37:55,335
-Okay, I got you.
-We got the ladder.

2060
01:37:55,368 --> 01:37:56,904
-Kate!
-Come on up the ladder.

2061
01:37:56,936 --> 01:37:58,305
We can do this
together, all right?

2062
01:37:58,337 --> 01:38:00,306
Everyone say
a non-denominational

2063
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:03,076
silent prayer
to themselves, please.

2064
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:04,945
Haley, don't be scared.
Here we go.

2065
01:38:04,978 --> 01:38:06,579
-That's really high.
-Come on, you can do it!

2066
01:38:06,613 --> 01:38:09,115
-It's too steep. I'm gonna fall.
-It's the only way out.

2067
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:10,617
-Look, there's Gramps.
-You're not gonna slip, honey.

2068
01:38:10,649 --> 01:38:11,951
-Come on.
-I can't, I can't.

2069
01:38:11,984 --> 01:38:14,954
We need to get in there and help them.
I need all your carabiners!

2070
01:38:14,988 --> 01:38:16,222
I'm all over it.

2071
01:38:16,256 --> 01:38:17,958
Hales, this could
keep sinking.

2072
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:19,292
Do you want me
to climb with you?

2073
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:20,694
What?

2074
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,448
I'll climb with you, okay? I'm gonna
climb right here, next to you.

2075
01:38:25,597 --> 01:38:27,701
Kate, you can do it!

2076
01:38:27,734 --> 01:38:31,138
Mommy used to do this at parties,
because she was a fucking idiot.

2077
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:32,706
-Come on. Come on.
-Come on, now.

2078
01:38:32,738 --> 01:38:34,240
Everybody!

2079
01:38:34,274 --> 01:38:35,475
-Don't look down. You got it.
-Kate! Kate! Kate!

2080
01:38:35,507 --> 01:38:37,411
Okay. Come on.

2081
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:39,079
There we go.

2082
01:38:39,112 --> 01:38:40,247
Yep. Yep.
Come on, girl.

2083
01:38:40,279 --> 01:38:41,614
-You got it.
-Haley. Come on!

2084
01:38:41,648 --> 01:38:42,716
You're almost there.

2085
01:38:42,748 --> 01:38:44,050
-Come on. I got it!
-Mom?

2086
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:45,118
I'm the mom!
Come on.

2087
01:38:49,655 --> 01:38:51,024
All right!

2088
01:38:56,496 --> 01:39:00,033
Now, everybody get the hell out of
here, before I call your children!

2089
01:39:05,137 --> 01:39:07,173
You jumped
into a sinkhole

2090
01:39:07,207 --> 01:39:09,609
and climbed
a rock wall to save me.

2091
01:39:09,641 --> 01:39:13,145
Yeah, it's called Mom strength.
I basically She-Hulked.

2092
01:39:13,179 --> 01:39:14,581
You're my kid.

2093
01:39:14,613 --> 01:39:16,317
It's the only job
I'll never quit.

2094
01:39:20,353 --> 01:39:21,587
Did you smell
my head?

2095
01:39:21,621 --> 01:39:23,123
Yeah, smells good.

2096
01:39:23,155 --> 01:39:24,591
You're such a weirdo.

2097
01:39:24,623 --> 01:39:26,063
Remember, I can
throw a car at you.

2098
01:39:35,368 --> 01:39:37,171
Maybe it'll look
better in the daylight?

2099
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:44,543
Why is it blue?

2100
01:39:44,577 --> 01:39:46,613
Well, we are
totally fucked.

2101
01:39:46,645 --> 01:39:48,347
My God, Mom,
don't say "fucked."

2102
01:39:48,381 --> 01:39:50,350
It sounds so wrong
coming out of your mouth.

2103
01:39:50,382 --> 01:39:53,319
Too fucking bad.

2104
01:39:53,353 --> 01:39:55,188
I'm pissed.

2105
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:57,390
And I'll say
whatever I wanna say

2106
01:39:57,423 --> 01:40:00,594
because I am cuntingly
disappointed in you!

2107
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:01,762
-Wow.
-All right.

2108
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:05,097
That's not even a word. God,
you guys need to chill out.

2109
01:40:05,131 --> 01:40:06,300
God!

2110
01:40:07,332 --> 01:40:08,734
God!

2111
01:40:08,768 --> 01:40:10,670
Calm down, Mom!

2112
01:40:10,703 --> 01:40:11,739
Fuck off!

2113
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:20,247
Asses up!

2114
01:40:20,279 --> 01:40:21,481
Now!

2115
01:40:48,307 --> 01:40:49,542
God!

2116
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:50,576
Who's that?

2117
01:40:52,112 --> 01:40:54,081
Whoa!
What happened here?

2118
01:40:55,515 --> 01:40:57,117
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Ellis.

2119
01:40:57,149 --> 01:40:58,317
You look great.

2120
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,689
You find
my hearing aid?

2121
01:41:05,324 --> 01:41:06,725
Where did you
leave it?

2122
01:41:06,759 --> 01:41:08,662
She can't hear you.

2123
01:41:08,694 --> 01:41:10,563
She had to take them out because
the beeping was freaking me out

2124
01:41:10,596 --> 01:41:11,731
when I was on drugs.

2125
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:18,838
What?

2126
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:20,007
Nobody's lips
are moving.

2127
01:41:20,039 --> 01:41:22,708
Okay. I'm pretty sure I
swallowed all my credit cards,

2128
01:41:22,742 --> 01:41:24,644
so I'm gonna go
deal with that.

2129
01:41:24,676 --> 01:41:26,378
Come on, my love.

2130
01:41:26,412 --> 01:41:28,182
Happy Birthday!

2131
01:41:34,753 --> 01:41:38,425
When the girls were little, I used to
wash their hair with this sprayer.

2132
01:41:38,457 --> 01:41:41,627
I could put this one
in the condo, if you like.

2133
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:42,663
No.

2134
01:41:44,497 --> 01:41:45,632
I'll remember it.

2135
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:56,243
Scratch my back?

2136
01:42:03,615 --> 01:42:04,615
There?

2137
01:42:11,224 --> 01:42:12,458
<i>Listen, Dad...</i>

2138
01:42:12,492 --> 01:42:15,427
I'll buy the house as is and
Kate and Haley can stay here.

2139
01:42:15,461 --> 01:42:16,530
No, you won't.

2140
01:42:16,563 --> 01:42:17,731
Let me fix things.

2141
01:42:17,732 --> 01:42:18,899
You've done enough.

2142
01:42:18,931 --> 01:42:20,800
Don't you have
a plane to catch?

2143
01:42:20,832 --> 01:42:23,603
When are you gonna learn that
your help isn't always wanted?

2144
01:42:25,904 --> 01:42:28,240
I can't offer
as much as Maura can,

2145
01:42:28,274 --> 01:42:30,210
but I do have
some money.

2146
01:42:30,243 --> 01:42:33,614
Can I please live in your
house, temporarily, with Haley,

2147
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:36,550
and fix it up?

2148
01:42:36,582 --> 01:42:38,684
-Don't have to answer right away...
-No.

2149
01:42:38,717 --> 01:42:40,386
Please,
just go home.

2150
01:42:41,554 --> 01:42:43,289
I have no more home.

2151
01:42:49,796 --> 01:42:52,298
Pulling out the
granddaughter card.

2152
01:42:53,265 --> 01:42:54,367
God damn it.

2153
01:42:55,902 --> 01:42:58,904
All right, I'll give you
two weeks to fix it up

2154
01:42:58,938 --> 01:43:00,908
and then I'm torching
it for insurance.

2155
01:43:01,573 --> 01:43:02,908
Okay.

2156
01:43:02,942 --> 01:43:05,179
That's everything I have.

2157
01:43:06,679 --> 01:43:08,582
Can you fix
the damage for that?

2158
01:43:08,614 --> 01:43:09,615
No.

2159
01:43:10,949 --> 01:43:13,487
But I'll help you
do it.

2160
01:43:15,421 --> 01:43:17,324
Is Maura still in town?

2161
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:18,892
No.

2162
01:43:43,983 --> 01:43:45,652
I thought you
flew to Atlanta.

2163
01:43:48,354 --> 01:43:50,390
I didn't wanna leave town
until I said I was sorry.

2164
01:43:57,663 --> 01:43:59,265
And I think I melted
my driver's license

2165
01:43:59,298 --> 01:44:00,698
in the microwave,
the other night.

2166
01:44:02,668 --> 01:44:04,371
I'm sorry, Kate.

2167
01:44:04,404 --> 01:44:07,674
I'm sorry that I didn't tell
you that Haley was with me.

2168
01:44:07,707 --> 01:44:09,443
Will you forgive me
for that?

2169
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:12,779
I'm gonna milk it
for a while.

2170
01:44:12,811 --> 01:44:13,913
Okay.

2171
01:44:15,981 --> 01:44:17,684
I made you something.

2172
01:44:17,716 --> 01:44:19,952
I was gonna send it to you,
but I didn't have any stamps

2173
01:44:19,985 --> 01:44:21,505
because they don't
make them anymore.

2174
01:44:26,492 --> 01:44:28,996
"Sisters are always there
for each other.

2175
01:44:30,697 --> 01:44:33,565
"But some sisters
think they're hot shit,

2176
01:44:33,599 --> 01:44:35,702
"and do super-intrusive,
fucked-up things,

2177
01:44:35,734 --> 01:44:38,904
"like secretly harbor the other one's
child so they can feel superior."

2178
01:44:38,938 --> 01:44:40,774
Quotes are usually short.

2179
01:44:40,806 --> 01:44:43,777
So are dicks, but sometimes
you hit the jackpot.

2180
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:44,945
Keep reading.

2181
01:44:47,713 --> 01:44:51,751
"And some sisters live their lives
in chaos, like a goddamn tornado,

2182
01:44:51,783 --> 01:44:54,653
"so the other sister has to
clean it up all the time.

2183
01:44:54,686 --> 01:44:57,356
"So, they're both wrong.
The end."

2184
01:44:58,757 --> 01:45:00,592
When I was
party mom,

2185
01:45:00,626 --> 01:45:04,463
I realized that always having to
take care of everyone's shit sucks.

2186
01:45:04,497 --> 01:45:06,566
And I'm sure
you realized

2187
01:45:06,599 --> 01:45:09,836
that it's not all fun being
selfish and leaving a mess.

2188
01:45:09,868 --> 01:45:11,904
It's pretty fucking fun.

2189
01:45:15,975 --> 01:45:18,779
We need to say goodbye to this
house and who we were here.

2190
01:45:23,682 --> 01:45:27,653
You know, James told me
that a house is a building

2191
01:45:27,686 --> 01:45:30,657
but home is a feeling.

2192
01:45:30,689 --> 01:45:32,524
He's smart. You need
to lock that guy down.

2193
01:45:32,557 --> 01:45:33,893
I blew it with him.

2194
01:45:33,926 --> 01:45:35,662
No, he's still
asking about you.

2195
01:45:35,694 --> 01:45:36,962
-He is?
-Yeah.

2196
01:45:36,996 --> 01:45:38,631
He is the greatest.

2197
01:45:38,663 --> 01:45:39,965
James just needs some...

2198
01:45:39,998 --> 01:45:41,835
No! Stop deciding
what other people need.

2199
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:44,371
You need help.
Let him help you.

2200
01:45:46,773 --> 01:45:49,376
I got to go scrub "I heart
balls" off the fridge.

2201
01:45:49,408 --> 01:45:50,543
I'm sorry I wrote that.

2202
01:45:51,077 --> 01:45:52,412
Wait!

2203
01:45:54,046 --> 01:45:56,149
What do I do
when I see him?

2204
01:45:56,181 --> 01:45:59,586
See, I'm asking
for help already.

2205
01:45:59,618 --> 01:46:01,058
Find a way to
make him come to you.

2206
01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:03,856
But go big.

2207
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,559
Make it clear
that you need him.

2208
01:46:15,935 --> 01:46:17,437
Help!

2209
01:46:18,938 --> 01:46:20,507
Help!

2210
01:46:32,717 --> 01:46:34,520
Help.

2211
01:46:37,122 --> 01:46:38,759
I know you used
to be a lifeguard.

2212
01:46:39,725 --> 01:46:41,027
I need it.

2213
01:46:44,896 --> 01:46:46,132
Save me, please!

2214
01:46:59,078 --> 01:47:00,747
My God.

2215
01:47:00,779 --> 01:47:01,914
I'm drowning.

2216
01:47:01,948 --> 01:47:03,115
Don't die.

2217
01:47:03,649 --> 01:47:04,751
Come here.

2218
01:47:14,092 --> 01:47:16,496
Water feels good
on my ballerina hole.

2219
01:47:19,498 --> 01:47:21,733
-What about your dick burns?
-Ooh.

2220
01:47:21,766 --> 01:47:23,702
Nice to meet you,
Dick Burns.

2221
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,609
How in the hell
did you pull this off?

2222
01:48:02,641 --> 01:48:06,078
Well, I usually give 30% and I
went for the full 100 this time.

2223
01:48:07,846 --> 01:48:09,715
You might need
one more coat.

2224
01:48:11,149 --> 01:48:12,719
What?

2225
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:16,022
There we go.

2226
01:48:16,055 --> 01:48:17,373
Thanks for doing this.

2227
01:48:17,374 --> 01:48:18,691
Well...

2228
01:48:18,724 --> 01:48:20,293
Thank you
for bringing me Dave.

2229
01:48:20,326 --> 01:48:22,962
He's really quite
the tender love maker.

2230
01:48:22,994 --> 01:48:23,994
So, this is awesome.

2231
01:48:24,829 --> 01:48:25,899
Come on, girlfriend.

2232
01:48:25,931 --> 01:48:26,931
Dave has chlamydia.

2233
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:29,636
Right, friendship.

2234
01:48:40,179 --> 01:48:42,949
Mom, this guy wants to know if
he can get 10% off his manicure

2235
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:44,751
because he only
has nine fingers.

2236
01:48:44,783 --> 01:48:46,383
Hang up. It's your
grandpa pranking us.

2237
01:48:47,019 --> 01:48:48,688
Nice try, Gramps.

2238
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:51,123
Gross! Get a room!

2239
01:48:51,157 --> 01:48:52,592
You know
you love it.

2240
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:53,560
It's 10:00!

2241
01:48:53,592 --> 01:48:54,993
Champagne time.

2242
01:48:55,027 --> 01:48:56,261
I'm gonna
do this every week.

2243
01:48:56,295 --> 01:48:57,430
Hae-Won, you're incredible.

2244
01:48:57,431 --> 01:48:58,565
Thank you, Jack.

2245
01:48:58,597 --> 01:48:59,832
-High five!
-No.

2246
01:48:59,864 --> 01:49:02,167
-Sorry.
-All right, everybody, gather up.

2247
01:49:02,201 --> 01:49:05,738
On behalf of my co-owner
Hae-Won and myself.

2248
01:49:05,770 --> 01:49:07,573
-Yay!
-Thank you, Alex,

2249
01:49:07,606 --> 01:49:09,042
For investing in our dreams.

2250
01:49:09,074 --> 01:49:10,976
Just here to
do my part.

2251
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:12,145
Whoa! Hair part!

2252
01:49:12,177 --> 01:49:13,211
God.
Here we go.

2253
01:49:13,244 --> 01:49:15,148
Yoinks!

2254
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:16,748
There is a lid
for every pot.

2255
01:49:16,782 --> 01:49:18,184
I'm gonna punch him
right in the dick.

2256
01:49:18,216 --> 01:49:19,318
Let's do this!

2257
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:22,255
Merry Christmas.

2258
01:49:22,287 --> 01:49:24,022
-Haley, you ready?
-I'm coming!

2259
01:49:24,055 --> 01:49:25,925
Hello! Hi.

2260
01:49:28,761 --> 01:49:31,965
Merry Christmas,
my two angel.

2261
01:49:31,997 --> 01:49:34,067
And welcome
to your new home!

2262
01:49:35,266 --> 01:49:37,237
Come on,
let's go pick a room!

2263
01:49:37,970 --> 01:49:39,204
Really?

2264
01:49:39,238 --> 01:49:42,208
No, wheelie.

2265
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:45,845
If this doesn't smell like our
Christmas, I will flip a table.

2266
01:49:46,278 --> 01:49:47,947
Hi!

2267
01:49:47,979 --> 01:49:49,381
Hi!

2268
01:49:49,414 --> 01:49:51,283
-All right, hi!
-Come here.

2269
01:49:51,317 --> 01:49:52,535
Look at you.

2270
01:49:52,536 --> 01:49:53,752
No, look at you.
Look at you.

2271
01:49:54,819 --> 01:49:56,889
Cookies!

2272
01:49:56,921 --> 01:49:58,457
How beautiful!
Look at these!

2273
01:49:58,458 --> 01:49:59,992
They're store-bought.

2274
01:50:00,025 --> 01:50:01,293
Good to see you. Good to see you.
Good to see you.

2275
01:50:01,327 --> 01:50:02,829
-Did you make these?
-No.

2276
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:04,597
No, I bought them
at a gas station.

2277
01:50:05,797 --> 01:50:07,766
Still feels like
our Christmas.

2278
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,101
Yeah.

2279
01:50:09,135 --> 01:50:10,737
Because we're the home.

2280
01:50:13,405 --> 01:50:14,608
Yeah.

2281
01:50:15,740 --> 01:50:16,743
Come here, bootch.

2282
01:50:25,051 --> 01:50:27,387
-Let me lead, I'm the big sister.
-Okay.

2283
01:51:14,466 --> 01:51:17,436
What kind of...
Fuck.

2284
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:18,705
Sorry. Bloopers!

2285
01:51:18,706 --> 01:51:19,939
Yeah.

2286
01:51:19,971 --> 01:51:22,974
Whoo! Hey, I put in a special
request for our Applebutt...

2287
01:51:23,007 --> 01:51:25,278
Hey, I... Fuck me, sorry.
Fuck, sorry.

2288
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:26,445
-Can I try it again?
-Ellis I... Sure.

2289
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:28,146
-Let's try again.
-Sorry.

2290
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:29,414
You probably
don't remember.

2291
01:51:29,448 --> 01:51:31,951
I remember.

2292
01:51:31,984 --> 01:51:35,021
I remember.
I don't remember.

2293
01:51:35,054 --> 01:51:37,824
My safe word is "Dow Jones
Industrial Average."

2294
01:51:37,856 --> 01:51:39,891
My safe word is
"geopolitical disaster."

2295
01:51:39,925 --> 01:51:42,228
My safe word is
"pseudoparathyroidism."

2296
01:51:42,261 --> 01:51:45,198
<i>That girl is poison</i>

2297
01:51:46,498 --> 01:51:48,867
<i>She's dangerous</i>

2298
01:51:50,101 --> 01:51:54,006
I am done wasting words on
that cum-guzzling road whore.

2299
01:51:54,038 --> 01:51:55,038
Wow.

2300
01:52:05,917 --> 01:52:08,755
Sorry.

2301
01:52:08,787 --> 01:52:09,921
I can't believe that
you haven't farted

2302
01:52:09,954 --> 01:52:11,923
this whole time.

2303
01:52:11,957 --> 01:52:14,327
Good job. Now I put it
in your head, sorry.

2304
01:52:14,359 --> 01:52:15,494
No, they've
been silent.

2305
01:52:15,528 --> 01:52:17,363
Okay, here we go.

2306
01:52:17,395 --> 01:52:20,132
Hae-Won.
Am I saying it correctly?

2307
01:52:20,166 --> 01:52:21,768
Hae-Won.

2308
01:52:21,801 --> 01:52:23,402
I'm just gonna
throw it away. Hae-Won.

2309
01:52:23,435 --> 01:52:24,470
No.

2310
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:28,440
Hae...

2311
01:52:30,509 --> 01:52:32,110
Wait, I've got it.

2312
01:52:32,144 --> 01:52:33,512
Hae-Won.

2313
01:52:37,448 --> 01:52:38,518
Hae-Won.

2314
01:52:38,551 --> 01:52:39,886
Hae-Won.

2315
01:52:43,288 --> 01:52:44,990
Sorry.

2316
01:52:46,257 --> 01:52:47,292
I'm sorry.

2317
01:52:50,529 --> 01:52:52,899
Let me just see if
I'm pronouncing it correctly.

2318
01:52:54,567 --> 01:52:55,769
Sorry.

2319
01:52:56,135 --> 01:52:57,470
Hae-Won.

2320
01:53:02,841 --> 01:53:04,210
And cut.

2321
01:53:05,305 --> 01:53:11,872
