2
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:04,513
What's happened here?

3
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:07,516
Martha and Carl Brodie,
mother and son.

4
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:09,519
No one's seen them
since Tuesday.

5
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,021
The car is a trans am,
blue with yellow pinstriping.

California license: 2clg592.

7
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:19,027
No one's seen that
since Tuesday, either.

8
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:22,030
God, I just hope nothing horrible
happened to them. They were so close!

9
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:25,534
Ma'am, please, step back.

10
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:29,038
Sheriff, what
do you think happened?

11
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,043
I don't know, but somebody
sure doesn't like cats.

12
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,067
Shit!

13
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:16,585
Looks like the place has been
empty for a hundred years.

14
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:19,589
Well, it hasn't.

15
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,595
What the hell was that?

16
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,647
Jesus!

17
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:21,150
It's a little girl.

18
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:25,655
What's that in her hair?

19
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,161
A rose.

20
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:09,879
Tanya.

21
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:38,907
- Hi.
- Shhh.

22
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:41,911
He can't hear us.

23
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,415
Shit!

24
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,419
Come on.
He'll be back.

25
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,922
You always get 'em
sooner or later.

26
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:57,926
Dance with me.
I don't wanna dance.

27
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,930
Sure you do.
You'll love this one.

28
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,445
Come on.

29
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:35,965
What's for dinner?

30
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:37,967
Roast chicken
and cranberry dressing.

31
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,469
Pumpkin pie for dessert.

32
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,973
Going anywhere tonight?

33
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,975
To the movies, maybe.

34
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,978
With a friend?
With a special friend?

35
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:52,481
All by my lonesome.

36
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:55,483
Oh, don't ask your mother.

37
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:58,487
Well, actually, there's
a girl that works there.

38
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,490
I thought I might ask her out.

39
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,993
Oh, you might?

40
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:09,498
She's pretty too.

41
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,000
Is she nice?

42
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:14,502
I don't know.

43
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:16,505
I guess I'll find out, won't I?

44
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,513
- Jealous?
- Concerned.

45
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:29,018
Right.

46
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,023
Concerned.

47
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,026
Mm-hmm, concerned.

48
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:52,041
Should I be jealous?

49
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:57,546
Do you like that?

50
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,550
Oh, mother.

51
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,133
?? Do you love me??
?? Do you love me??

52
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:27,635
?? Do you love me, baby??
?? Do you love me??

53
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:31,140
?? Do you love me??
?? Do you love me??

54
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,642
?? Now that I??

55
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:41,149
?? Can dance
watch me now??

56
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,153
?? Work, work??
?? Oh, work it out, baby??

57
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:47,655
?? Work, work???? I'm
gonna drive you crazy??

58
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:50,659
?? Work, work???? Uh, just
a little bit slow now??

59
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,163
?? Work??
?? I can mash potato??

60
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:57,665
?? I can mash potato??

61
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,169
?? I can do the twist??
?? I can do the twist??

62
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:03,671
?? Tell me, baby??
?? Tell me, baby??

63
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:07,175
?? Do you like it like this????
Do you like it like this??

64
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,179
?? Tell me??
?? Tell me??

65
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,181
?? Tell me, wow??

66
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:15,183
?? Do you love me??

67
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:18,186
?? Do you love me??
?? Do you love me, baby??

68
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:21,689
?? Do you love me??
?? Now do you love me??

69
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,192
?? Do you love me??

70
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,695
?? Now that I??

71
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:32,200
?? Can dance??

72
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,702
?? Watch me now...????

73
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,705
Aaah! Oh!

74
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,211
You scared me.
Sorry. Sorry.

75
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,214
Oh, no. I'll take that.

76
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:49,718
Charles Brady.

77
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,221
Thanks for the help,
Charles Brady.

78
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,224
Don't mention it.

79
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:59,727
Could I get a popcorn
and a medium Mr. pibb, please?

80
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:01,730
Yes.

81
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:15,243
I'm very embarrassed.
Am I blushing?

82
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:19,247
- You look good in red, Tanya.
- How'd you know my name?

83
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:21,750
English, period four,
creative writing.

84
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:25,254
Mr. fallows,
the weird and terrible.

85
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,257
Oh, you're the new guy.
From Ohio?

86
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:31,760
Paradise falls.
Oh.

87
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,764
Popcorn.

88
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:49,277
Go ahead.
You mean... free?

89
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,781
Shhh.
Thanks.

90
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:58,786
I don't suppose you'd like a ride
home after work tonight, would you?

91
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:01,790
Um, my dad picks me up.

92
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,293
Mmm, nice dad.
Yeah.

93
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,795
Besides, what
would your girlfriend say...

94
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:09,797
If you gave the popcorn girl
a ride home?

95
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:12,801
No girlfriend.
I'm new in town, remember?

96
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,806
Thanks.
I'll see you in class.

97
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:22,310
Oh, oh, wait!

98
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:26,315
Um... welcome to Travis.

99
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,818
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

100
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:40,329
Oh, my God!

101
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,347
Hi!

102
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,849
I'm okay.
How's my girl?

103
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,851
I'm good, dad.

104
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:06,855
Good.
Fasten your seat belt.

105
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,370
Tanya.

106
00:15:54,403 --> 00:15:57,405
It's my son, officer.

107
00:15:57,406 --> 00:16:00,908
- Cat?

108
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:03,911
Having himself one hissy fit,
I'll tell you.

109
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:08,417
I'm sorry, officer. It's late,
but this allergy is so severe.

110
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,420
Yeah, I know. I got one too.
Mine's to the I.R.S.

111
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,921
Y'all have a good night.

112
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:17,426
Thank you, officer.

113
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,932
It just ignored the trap.
It was right by the window.

114
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:29,437
It's okay.
It's gone now.

115
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:32,941
I'll set some more traps
in the morning.

116
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,953
Did you bring me anything?

117
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,956
Anything special in mind?

118
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,961
Am I beautiful?

119
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:55,963
You're always
beautiful, mother.

120
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,965
So...

121
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:01,970
Did you ask
this mystery girl out?

122
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,975
What kind of a girl would go
out with a guy she just met?

123
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:12,980
Not a very nice one, I suppose.

124
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,983
Another one?
Goddamn cats.

125
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,487
Don't swear, mother.

126
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:24,493
Just you make sure
you ask her out tomorrow.

127
00:17:27,496 --> 00:17:29,497
What's her name?

128
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,000
Tanya robertson.

129
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:37,005
Is she nice?

130
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:42,009
She's nice.
I'm sure of it.

131
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,513
She's pure.
Good.

132
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:49,017
I'm famished, Charles.

133
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:01,029
Famished!

134
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:07,535
"They were sleepwalkers,
hiding in human robes.

135
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:10,538
"Feeding on virtue.

136
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,041
"Loving to feed,
feeding to breed..

137
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:17,044
"So, in the end, they ran.

138
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:20,548
"In the end, Robbie and
his mother always had to run.

139
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:23,551
"For one night, the men
would come in their old cars,

140
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,553
"men with lights and guns.

141
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:28,055
"And to the boy and his mother,

142
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:30,558
"their curses and the screams
of rage always sound the same.

143
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,061
"Like the laughter
of cruel gods.

"The time of happiness,

"too brief to be
anything but golden,

00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,570
had run out."

147
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:47,575
Very good, Charles.
Very good.

148
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:51,580
Your teachers in Ohio must have been
sorry to lose such a creative young man.

149
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,081
I beg your pardon,
Mr. fallows?

150
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:58,085
Isn't that where you
transferred from? Ohio?

151
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:02,591
- Oh, yes. Yes, it is.
- Hey. Psst.

152
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,595
Aw, shit!

153
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:19,106
I suggest that next time, you keep
your hands to yourself, Mr. Crawford.

154
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:22,110
Yes, sir.

155
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:24,612
Asshole.

156
00:19:24,613 --> 00:19:29,117
All right, any thoughts
on Mr. Brady's "sleepwalkers"?

157
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:33,622
- Miss robertson?
- I liked it.

158
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:37,124
- You liked it?

159
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,629
It was different.
I thought it was very sad.

160
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,633
Sad? Why?

161
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,136
Because they were
always driven away.

162
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,139
Because they
were such outsiders.

163
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,642
I think miss robertson
might be on to something.

164
00:19:54,643 --> 00:19:57,144
Now, we all understand
that a story...

165
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:02,149
Has to have a beginning,
a middle and an end, right?

166
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,153
But that's like saying
a box has four sides.

167
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:09,657
Actually, Mr. fallows,
a box has six sides.

168
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:12,661
Busted!

169
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:46,695
Ahh! Ah! Ah!
Ahhhhh!

170
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,199
I'm just kidding. You
actually talked to him?

171
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,704
Yeah, he's nice.
Real nice!

172
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:58,706
I'm serious!
I can see that.

173
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:01,709
Well, what happened? Did he
ask you out of anything?

174
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,714
Nothing specific, just a maybe.
We just talked at the theater.

175
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:10,217
That's all you would've done anyway.
What a waste!

176
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:13,220
Well, excuse me, but
what would you have done?

177
00:21:13,221 --> 00:21:15,723
Everything.

178
00:21:15,724 --> 00:21:18,726
Everything!

179
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:21,228
Well, I may have
plans of my own,

180
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:23,732
and they just might
include homeland.

181
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:25,734
Oooh!
Yeah, right!

182
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:28,737
I can just see you in the
back seat at homeland.

183
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:32,239
You guys! Tanya, you gotta admit,
your dad's gonna be there.

184
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,242
I can just see it.
My dad's not gonna be there.

185
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:39,748
- Hi.
- Charles... hi.

186
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,752
Charles... um, do you know
Jeanette and Carrie?

187
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:46,755
This is Charles Brady.
Hi.

188
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:49,758
We are in the same class, Tanya.
Oh.

189
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:53,261
Can I give you a ride home?
Uh, I mean all of you.

190
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,263
Um... no, we've got a ride.

191
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:59,767
But why don't you go, Tanya?

192
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:02,270
Okay, see you later.

193
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:12,280
I, uh...
I also wanted to thank you.

194
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:15,283
For what?

195
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:20,788
For what you said in class.
I mean, you really nailed it.

196
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:24,792
No, you did, so thank you.

197
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:27,796
I think I know how they feel,
the, um... what are they called?

198
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:31,298
Sleepwalkers.
Sleepwalkers.

199
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,302
At least sometimes
I feel that different.

200
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:38,306
Look!

201
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:46,814
Madam.
This yours?

202
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:49,317
Do you like it?
Yeah.

203
00:22:56,825 --> 00:23:00,828
Whoa! You know, some
people use a door. Really?

204
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:02,830
Yes.
I heard that somewhere.

205
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:05,333
Did you?
Mm-hmm.

206
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,844
Mom? Mom?

207
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:19,347
She must be shopping
or something.

208
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:21,850
Mmm.
Let's go upstairs.

209
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,352
Okay.

210
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:30,358
Thanks for the ride home.
Anytime.

211
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,361
Oh, wow!
These are interesting.

212
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:38,366
Oh. My mom does
gravestone rubbings.

213
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:40,868
Pretty morbid, huh?

214
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:43,370
No, I like 'em.
You do?

215
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:45,874
Yeah.
Ewww.

216
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:52,379
My room.

217
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,882
Oh, you have a lot of pictures.

218
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:57,385
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.

219
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,890
Oh, these are great!

220
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:05,893
Really nice.

221
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:08,896
Makes you want to...
what?

222
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:12,399
Oh! Just really get a good
look at these kind of places.

223
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,403
You know, things
that we never really see.

224
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:20,408
My-my favorite picture's
over there.

225
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:23,411
Which one?
Uh...

226
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:29,416
um.... that one.

227
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,418
I like rocks.

228
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:33,421
You do?

229
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:36,925
You know,
I'd really like to see...

230
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:40,427
How you see a photograph
before you take it, and...

231
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:42,429
I mean, you don't
even know me, but...

232
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,935
well, um, actually, I was gonna
shoot at homeland tomorrow if...

233
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:50,437
well, if you want to come.
What's homeland?

234
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:53,942
Oh, it's a... it's an old graveyard.
Really?

235
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,944
Yeah, it's neat.
I love old graveyards.

236
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,946
Sweetheart, I...
mom!

237
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,949
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I-I didn't know you had company.

238
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,452
Oh, this is Charles Brady.
This is my mom.

239
00:25:05,453 --> 00:25:08,455
Charles. Um, he gave
me a ride home.

240
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:12,459
Oh, that's nice.
Charles.

241
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,964
- Very nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

242
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,966
Well, we should go.

243
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,969
We were just going.
Um, so we'll do that tomorrow?

244
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,971
Yes.
Okay.

245
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,473
I'll walk you out.

246
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,977
Okay.

247
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:31,478
So you two
are going out tomorrow?

248
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,480
Yes.

249
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:38,486
Uh, Tanya's gonna show me...
Homeland. Shhh.

250
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:40,988
Oh, really?

251
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:43,992
You see, I do rubbings too.
Not quite as fine as yours,

252
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:46,995
but I figure there must be some
old slate gravestones out there.

253
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,998
Uh, yes, as a matter of fact,

254
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:53,000
in the old section
near the woods.

255
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:56,003
Tell me, Charles,
do you use powder or stick?

256
00:25:56,004 --> 00:25:59,007
I use stick.
Usually a number five.

257
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:02,509
Really? Don't you
find that a little hard?

258
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,514
Yeah, but, uh, I'm clumsy.
You know, powder's so messy.

259
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:10,517
Tell me, Charles,
where do you live?

260
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:12,519
66 wicker street.

261
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,523
- Your father, what does he do?
- He's dead, Mrs. robertson.

262
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:20,028
Oh, I'm sorry.
It was a long time ago.

263
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:26,533
Well, um, the brands will be
coming to dinner tomorrow night.

264
00:26:26,534 --> 00:26:29,036
So be back by 5:00, okay?

265
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:31,039
Okay.
She will be.

266
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:39,546
How'd you know all that stuff?

267
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:42,550
I learned it a long
time ago, from my mom.

268
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:48,556
See you tomorrow.
Okay.

269
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,661
?? It's a monster
it's a monster??

270
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:15,666
?? It's a monster
it's a monster??

271
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,669
?? Can't you see
it's a monster??

272
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,172
?? It's a monster??

273
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,699
Mr. fallows! Hi.

274
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,200
Hello, Charles.

275
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,703
Checking out
your new environment?

276
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,205
Boring, isn't it?

277
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:59,710
- Disneyland for cows.
- But for human beings?

278
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:03,213
Well, I like it.
It's kind of peaceful.

279
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,717
Reminds you of Ohio, I suppose?

280
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,720
Yeah, well, you know...

281
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:14,725
no, actually, I don't, Charles. I don't know.
And you don't, either.

282
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,729
There is no
paradise falls in Ohio.

283
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:21,231
Your transcripts
are also fakes.

284
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,234
Clever fakes, but fakes.

285
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,236
Anything to say?

286
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,739
You're mistaken.
Oh, no, I'm not.

287
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,242
But you are, Charles, if you think
you can wiggle out of this.

288
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:36,747
I don't know who you are, but I know
you're not who you say you are.

289
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:41,251
If this is blackmail, Mr. fallows, I
think you've picked the wrong guy.

290
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,254
This car is the only
expensive thing I've got.

291
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,256
I'm kinda sentimental about it.
I don't think I can sell it.

292
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:49,260
Ow! Sit till I'm
through with you.

293
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:56,266
Your generation is so mercenary, Charles.
Money this, money that.

294
00:28:56,267 --> 00:29:00,772
Well, money is not
the only medium of exchange.

295
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:07,778
You're right, Mr. fallows. People really should
learn to keep their hands to themselves.

296
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,781
Here's yours.

297
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,304
I'm sorry!

298
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,366
Come on, boy.
Get the bad guy for daddy.

299
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,369
You know you want him.
Get this bad guy.

300
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,372
There you go.
There you go, clovis.

301
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:45,876
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
Get the bad guy.

302
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,378
Get the bad guy.
Get the bad guy.

303
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,882
Come on, clovis.
Here we go.

304
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,383
Get that motherfucker!

305
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,886
All right!
Good boy, clovis!

306
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:59,389
Yeah, that's a good boy.

307
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,393
Huh, clovis?

308
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,395
Well, clovis,

309
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:09,400
looks like we found ourselves
a goddamn speedster.

310
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,916
Unit three calling home.
You in there, Laurie? Come on.

311
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,418
Andy, what you up to?
Bye.

312
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,923
Got ourselves one lawless perpetrator
heading east out here on gray road.

313
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,425
Copy? Copy. Need any help? Bye.

314
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:39,429
Nah. I think I can handle
this one all by myself.

315
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,933
What the... Jesus!

316
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,479
Oh, shit!

317
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,515
Jesus, no!

318
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,021
Everybody okay?
Go get him!

319
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:15,525
Son of a bitch. Report, unit three.
Need a location.

320
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,029
I'm out on pond road,
Laurie, still in pursuit.

321
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,531
Bastard almost ran down
a little girl!

322
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,033
I think hetried
to run her down!

323
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,536
I think he's playing with me!
Get me some backup! Bye.

324
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,051
Pull over!

325
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,554
Pull over, motherfucker!

326
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,557
Pull over!

327
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,068
What the fuck?

328
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:08,079
What's going on out there, Andy?
Please respond! Not now, Laurie.

329
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:18,089
Christ, clovis! What's he got in there?
A supercharger?

330
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,656
I lost him.

331
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,660
How in the hell did I do that?

332
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,632
Stop looking at me.

333
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,637
Stop looking at me.

334
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,641
Stop looking at me,
you fucking cat!

335
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,162
Shit, clovis.

336
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,167
I know just how you feel.

337
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,204
Can I tell you something, ira?

338
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,207
It's kind of weird, but, uh...

339
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,712
Horace, if you laugh,
I'm gonna break your jaw.

340
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,716
What is it?

341
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,721
Well, you know how I told you I couldn't see
him because of how fast we were going, right?

342
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,224
Yeah. Well, that
wasn't entirely true.

343
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,228
- How's that?
- Well, we were both doing 90.

344
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,730
I pulled right up beside him. We might
as well have been standing still!

345
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:17,234
- So you did get a look at him.
- Well, no, no, I didn't.

346
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,238
'Cause... see...

347
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,243
He didn't have no face.

348
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,746
Andy, you got plenty
of sick time comin'.

349
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,750
Horace, shut your pie hole.

350
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:39,256
I-I-I mean his face!
It was like a... a blur!

351
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:44,262
Like... shit, I don't know.

352
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,766
Maybe you got some grit
in your eye.

353
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,270
Makes 'em water.

354
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,274
Yeah, I guess maybe
that could've been it.

355
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,276
Andy, do me a favor.

356
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,779
When you do get this stampeder,

357
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:07,285
just leave that part out when you
talk to the county prosecutor, okay?

358
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,291
Anything else, Andy?
Anything at all?

359
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,295
Yeah, there was something.

360
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,300
Clovis here got a good look at
him, and he didn't like him.

361
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,803
He didn't like him
one little bit.

362
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,807
And it was the other guy too.
He didn't like clovis!

363
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,811
It-it was like he was scared
of him. Scared of a cat!

364
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,315
Hmm.

365
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,319
I'm gonna look for this guy
on my way home,

366
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,822
and I'm gonna find him.

367
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,327
I'm gonna find him!

368
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,353
Oh!

369
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,360
You didn't get it?
No.

370
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,362
Why didn't you get anything?

371
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,865
I just couldn't.
What about the girl?

372
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:33,871
It wasn't the right time.
Tomorrow. I'll get it tomorrow.

373
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,876
What are you talking about?
I'm starving, Charles!

374
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,381
I need it, and you
have to get it for me!

375
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,894
Oh, my poor baby!
What happened?

376
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:02,399
- What always happens, mom?
- Someone saw you?

377
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,403
The deputy had a cat.
Maybe for a second or two.

378
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,906
He won't believe what he saw.
No, he probably won't.

379
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,911
Somebody will find the teacher
that I dumped in the woods.

380
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,914
It's already started
again, mom!

381
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:22,419
Don't worry. Don't worry.
But I have to feed you.

382
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,922
You'll see her tomorrow. What
if something happens to me?

383
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,924
You'll starve!

384
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,428
We haven't even seen
another sleepwalker.

385
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,930
Oh, we aren't the last.
You don't know that.

386
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,933
Yes, I do!

387
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,437
I can feel the others.

388
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,939
You'll feed tomorrow.

389
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,443
And then you'll feed me,
and then we will leave.

390
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,946
Nothing's gonna happen.

391
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,954
We just have to take care
of each other.

392
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,559
Okay.

393
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,061
Remember, honey,
I want you home by 5:00.

394
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,064
Make sure Charles
understands that, okay?

395
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,568
Yes, mommy. I'll be sure
to pack extra didies too.

396
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,572
Nobody loves a smart-ass, Tanya.
She is smart, dear.

397
00:42:55,573 --> 00:43:00,577
And I'm smart enough to know this is her
first date with the new boy in town.

398
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,079
We do understand each
other, don't we, tan?

399
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,082
You know, mom, I think we do.

400
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,084
Good.
Five o'clock?

401
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,087
Five o'clock.

402
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,590
Bye, darlin'.
Bye, dad.

403
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,092
Have a good time, honey.
I hope so!

404
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,094
Are we awful?

405
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,598
Terrible. God,
I've become my mother.

406
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,100
Well, you met this kid.
Is he okay?

407
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,605
Yeah, he's terrific.
He's utterly charming.

408
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,109
Does it have to be her?

409
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,613
You care more for her
than you do for me?

410
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,115
You know better than that.

411
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,119
Why are you being such a bitch?

412
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,123
Because I'm hungry!

413
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,634
You cannot be in love
with this girl, Charles.

414
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,639
Charles!

415
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,143
I'll get it.
You stay here.

416
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,649
I love you, mom.

417
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,152
Do you?

418
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:28,665
Hi. Um, I know you were supposed
to pick me up, but I was nearby.

419
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,168
Yeah, Tanya, um...

420
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,670
oh. Oh, this is a bad time.

421
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,674
Nonsense.
I'm so glad you came by.

422
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,177
Thank you.

423
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,681
Well, we really ought to go.
The light for Tanya's pictures...

424
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,184
will be just fine
for hours yet.

425
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,186
Come in, Tanya.
I have something for you.

426
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,689
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

427
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,194
I won't keep you long. I know young
people have to run and play.

428
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,700
Wow!

429
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:08,204
Charles said you were nice, and he was right.
He usually is.

430
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,208
Oh, well, thank you.
Charles is very nice himself.

431
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,712
You have a very beautiful
home, Mrs. Brady.

432
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,714
Mm-hmm.
Oh!

433
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,717
These are beautiful figurines.

434
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,719
Oh, they've been in the family
for a long time.

435
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,222
You probably wouldn't
believe how long.

436
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,725
Uh, mom, we really
ought to be going.

437
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,228
Soon, Charles. Soon.

438
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,732
Just a second, dear.

439
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,739
This is beautiful.

440
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,745
Mmm, nice car.
Where's the trans am?

441
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,749
Oh, it's in the shop.
The mustang belongs to...

442
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,753
his mother.

443
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:00,757
Wow! Those all your cats?
There's a lot of 'em.

444
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,760
Oh, they're strays,
but we'll get rid of them.

445
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,763
We're good at
getting rid of pests.

446
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,774
There.
It finishes you, somehow.

447
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,777
Thank you.
That's very sweet.

448
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:25,783
Oh, sweets to the sweet, I always say.
Right, Charles?

449
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,788
Go on now, you two.
You'll lose the light.

450
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:35,792
Um, Mrs. Brady, it was
really nice to meet you.

451
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,796
Oh, very nice to meet you.

452
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,319
This way.
Thank you, ma'am.

453
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,833
Uh, this is it.

454
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,356
It's really beautiful here.

455
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,860
And so are you, Tanya.

456
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,863
Thank you, Charles.

457
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,868
Well, I better get these
out of the way right off.

458
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,372
Your mother's gonna want to know
some rubbing went on out here.

459
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,376
Me too, Charles.

460
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,383
Hey, wait up!

461
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,894
Charles?

462
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,901
Charles?

463
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,905
Oh!

464
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,408
Oh, hold it.

465
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,413
Come on.

466
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,938
Hey, clovis. Hey, clovis, what's up?
You catching a nap?

467
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,442
?? There comes Johnny
with is pecker in his hand??

468
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,946
?? He's a one-balled man
and he's off to the rodeo????

469
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,464
What are you looking at?

470
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,967
Hmm?

471
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,470
Oh, mmm, very nice. Gotcha.

472
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:38,475
Oh, very nice. Smile pretty.

473
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,478
Oh, very nice!
Ahhh!

474
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,982
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, I'm sorry.

475
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,009
Sorry.

476
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,516
No sorries.

477
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:37,033
Charles?

478
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:41,537
Do you really feel alone like
the characters in your story?

479
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,041
'Cause I do.

480
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,045
I know.

481
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:55,051
It's wonderful to feel...

482
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,054
to feel like
you're really with someone.

483
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,556
Together.
I think we better...

484
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:04,561
Charles... shhh.

485
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,065
You don't know me, Tanya.

486
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,568
But I want to.

487
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:31,088
Ow! Mmm, a little slower.

488
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,094
But I thought we
understood each other, Tanya.

489
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,118
I couldn't breathe.

490
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,122
Isn't this the excitement
you were talking about, Tanya?

491
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,134
You're right. We do
understand each other, Tanya.

492
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,139
See, this is just
how we live, Tanya.

493
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,642
No!

494
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,645
Tanya!

495
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,648
It doesn't have to hurt!

496
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,651
Don't you get it, Tanya?

497
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,154
I need you.
I need you to live!

498
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,658
Oh, God!
Please don't kill me!

499
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:52,668
Tanya, I don't think you're
entering into the spirit of this.

500
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,923
Why don't you just think
of yourself... as lunch?

501
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,702
Charles?

502
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:32,209
Peek-a-baby!

503
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,211
I lied!

504
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,214
It does have to hurt!

505
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,218
Feed me, Tanya.
Mother's hungry.

506
00:53:55,732 --> 00:54:00,236
Just look at this shirt!
My mother's gonna kill me!

507
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,739
Get off me! Get off!

508
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,741
Stay away from me!

509
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,746
Now, Tanya, when exactly
did I lose your trust?

510
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,253
Help me!
Somebody help me!

511
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,256
?? So allemande left
and allemande right??

512
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,258
?? Come on, you fuckin' Turkey
get your right foot right??

513
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,260
?? Get off the stage
you fucking jerk??

514
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,263
?? You know
you piss me off????

515
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:31,267
Well, well...

516
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,770
Hold the phone!

517
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,973
Hold the phone!

518
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,479
All right.

519
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:44,980
- Help me!
- Please somebody help...

520
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,983
help! Oh, my God! Help me, please!
Get me out of here!

521
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:50,486
He's trying to kill me! Okay, calm down.
Tell me what happened.

522
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,489
He's right behind me!
Look, we'll get him!

523
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:55,992
You don't understand. He's trying to kill me!
This guy have a name?

524
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,994
His name is Charles Brady. He's not human!
His face changed!

525
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,997
Face changed? Get in the car.
Lock it. Yes! Please!

526
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,500
No, we both have to go, please.
Look, just calm down.

527
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,502
No, no, wait!
No! We both have to go!

528
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:10,507
Calm down, okay? Everything's
gonna be all... please, no!

529
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:18,514
Cop kebab!

530
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:21,518
No!

531
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,020
No!
Isn't this fun?

532
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,523
No! No!

533
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:30,025
No!

534
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:32,028
Off me!
Get off me!

535
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:39,536
Get off me!
Oh!

536
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,548
I don't believe you fired
a warning shot, officer.

537
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,058
Oh, my God!

538
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:10,567
Now... where were we, Tanya?

539
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,086
Oh, my God.

540
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,094
Unit three, unit three.
State your twenty. Come on.

541
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:41,597
Hello? Hello? Hello, help me, please!
Somebody help me!

542
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:45,101
Andy, get with the program. Bye.
Hello? Oh, God. Help!

543
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:52,107
Somebody help me, please! I'm at
homeland, and the policeman is dead!

544
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:55,111
Please! Please!
Please come!

545
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,626
Oh, God.
Please. Please come.

546
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:03,680
- Oh.
- Oh!

547
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,691
Charles!

548
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:20,697
My face is so hot!
Oh, God!

549
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:38,714
I'm sorry, mom. I tried.
I really, really tried.

550
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,716
It was the cat.
It was the kitty.

551
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:44,720
You were right.
We've only got each other.

552
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,722
Shh, shh, shh.

553
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:50,225
That doesn't matter.

554
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,729
Save your strength.

555
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:04,239
- How bad is it?
- Well, you'll be okay, honey.

556
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,744
But I'm afraid
they'll be coming for us soon.

557
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:13,749
We can go, mom. I'll be okay.
No.

558
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,753
We've got to stay here
until you're stronger.

559
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,255
But I want you to help me.

560
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:23,259
Try to make yourself dim.

561
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,262
Will you do that for me, honey?

562
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,267
Go on. Try.

563
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:51,286
I can't, mom.
I can't do it. Oh!

564
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,288
It's all right.
I'll do it for both of us.

565
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:57,793
There's the car and the...
The traps! Shh!

566
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,297
I'll take care of you.

567
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,804
Hey, buddy. Buddy.

568
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:11,306
I ain't taking the rap on this. I
lock this place up every night.

569
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:16,311
It's not my fault if every pervert, weirdo,
horny kid... go talk to someone in charge.

570
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,314
I'm busy.

571
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,823
Buddy.
Yeah?

572
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:32,327
Listen. It's not my fault if every horny
kid and weirdo, pervert comes in here.

573
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:36,833
I lock this place up. I don't need this action!
Okay, talk to the sheriff.

574
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,342
I checked it six or seven times.
Sheriff, hey.

575
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,345
Not now.

576
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,854
Okay. His name is Charles Brady,
formerly of paradise falls,

577
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:01,356
now living at 66 wicker street.

578
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,360
And the rest of it... including
the make and color of the car.

579
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:08,864
Okay, well,
we, we came in a red car.

580
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,366
And it was older.

581
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:15,370
But it wasn't a trans am. See,
he took me home in a trans am.

582
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:19,876
It was a blue trans am,
and he left here in one.

583
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,879
- Okay.
- Listen to me!

584
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,382
I know I sound crazy!

585
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:30,887
You're not getting the point!
Charles isn't human.

586
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:36,391
Excuse me, miss. Sheriff, I
need to document these bruises.

587
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:40,395
All right. Do you have
to do this right now?

588
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,397
Yeah. It'll just take a sec.
Don't worry.

589
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,401
Could you...
Just turn your head, please?

590
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,406
Thanks.
And the other way, please.

591
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:54,910
Oh, my God. My camera.
Did somebody find my camera?

592
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:57,413
I took his picture
in my camera.

593
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:02,417
Yes! Develop that film.
You'll have his picture.

594
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,419
Get on it, a.S.A.P.

595
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,423
Yeah, sure.

596
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,926
This is officer raeburn.

597
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:13,428
He's gonna run you home.

598
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:17,432
I'll have to come over later tonight and
ask you a few more questions, all right?

599
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:20,936
Okay. Are you sure his
name was Charles Brady?

600
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:22,938
That's what he said.

601
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:26,943
Do you think he was telling the truth?
I don't know.

602
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:32,949
He was...
he was very charming.

603
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,952
Take her home.

604
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:38,955
Excuse me.

605
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,967
- Um, sheriff?
- Yeah.

606
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,469
Will you bring the cat
when you come this evening?

607
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,471
What for?

608
01:02:56,472 --> 01:03:00,475
- The cat saved my life.
- Okay.

609
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,979
Thank you.

610
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,983
Do her parents know a class one
assault did not occur?

611
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:11,487
You mean, do they know she managed to
avoid being raped by the bastard? Yes.

612
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:15,991
Okay.
Horace.

613
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:19,495
Don't let her out of your sight.
Yepper.

614
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:35,510
Here.

615
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:39,015
Drink some of this nice cold water.
It'll make you feel better.

616
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,032
I'm dying, mom.

617
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,535
No.

618
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:03,038
My boy is not going to die!

619
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,542
Not ever!

620
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,586
They're coming.

621
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:54,089
I'm going to make us dim.
I can do it.

622
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,593
But you have to keep
perfectly quiet.

623
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,597
I love you.

624
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,602
Quiet, Charles.

625
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,107
It can still be all right.

626
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:14,609
I'm scared.

627
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,613
Charles Brady, come out with
your hands open and empty.

628
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:22,117
I'm so scared, mom.
Shh.

629
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:25,121
I have to do us.

630
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,126
Keep still.

631
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:35,631
Dim.

632
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:53,649
Open up, Brady.
I'm in no mood to be polite!

633
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,155
Police! Hands up!

634
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:04,160
Ira. Soames.
There's nothing in the kitchen.

635
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,668
I told you to wait on my word.

636
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:16,172
I thought you gave it.

637
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:22,677
A lot of cats. Well, I
can see that, dick-head.

638
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,680
Brody, can you handle it?

639
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,682
Come on.
Give it a push.

640
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:31,186
Oh, shit.

641
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,189
What a Polish fire drill.
Get out of there!

642
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,692
Get back in the damn car!
Now! Move!

643
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:39,694
Move! Move!

644
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,697
Move! Move!

645
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:55,710
What?
Cold draft.

646
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,713
Use one right now, could you?

647
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:26,241
I'd like to set up a couple of
checkpoints in and out of town.

648
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,744
The perp's history by now, ira.

649
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,247
He killed one of my men.

650
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,249
Look.

651
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,752
All you got is one hysterical little
girl with a very vivid imagination.

652
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:41,257
What about the cats?
What about 'em, ira?

653
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,259
Listen. That little girl
needs a good smack on the butt.

654
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:49,264
And if her mama and daddy won't do it...
I'll happily volunteer.

655
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:52,268
Stay away from her, soames.

656
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:02,277
Hmm. This is the best meal
I had since my wife passed on.

657
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:05,780
Boy, if ira found out,
he'd kill me.

658
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:08,283
Well, it was already made,
deputy.

659
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,286
Uh, there's one more ear of corn here.
Would you like it?

660
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,289
Well...
well, yes, ma'am.

661
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,802
She's been up there
an awfully long time, honey.

662
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:31,306
Do you think we should... she's
taking a nice hot bath.

663
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:34,810
She just needs to get clean.

664
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:18,353
Honey, is everything okay?

665
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,355
Yeah, I'm just getting out.

666
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,858
Your mother's keeping
supper warm for you.

667
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,361
Honey?

668
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:31,366
Um... thanks, daddy, um...

669
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,870
I just thought I would, uh,
lie down for a little while.

670
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:39,374
Could you call me when the
sheriff gets here with the cat?

671
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,878
Yeah, I will.
I love you, honey.

672
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,383
I love you too, daddy.

673
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,399
What was that?

674
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:20,415
Who's there?

675
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,418
Identify yourself.

676
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,920
Police officers.

677
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:29,425
Maybe it was the wind.

678
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:32,428
It was not the fuckin' wind.

679
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,938
You're right.
That was not the fucking wind.

680
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,948
Who could that be?
Let me take a peek.

681
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:09,464
State police.
Probably soames.

682
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:12,468
Hope he don't think he's gonna
question her before ira gets here.

683
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:15,471
I'll get this.

684
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:23,478
Hi, I'm Mary Brady,
Charles' mother.

685
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,482
- Charles couldn't come himself.
- Donald, who is it?

686
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,984
I'll take care of it, Helen.
Just stay in the kitchen.

687
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:33,989
- Look, Mrs. Brady... - but I know he
wanted you to have these flowers.

688
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:48,503
Donald! Donald?

689
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,006
You have a lovely home,
Mrs. robertson.

690
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:56,011
I've had lovely homes too.
We never stay long.

691
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,014
Hey!
You stay away from 'em!

692
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,018
If you'd just
call your daughter for me.

693
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:08,523
- What?
- My son is badly hurt. He may be dying.

694
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:12,026
Your daughter
tried to kill my Charles.

695
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:16,031
Good! I hope he dies!
I hope you both die!

696
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,534
I hope you both die
and rot in hell!

697
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:22,037
He's my son!
My only son!

698
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:30,045
Daddy? Mom?

699
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:46,061
Mom? Daddy?

700
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,064
Oh, my God. No!

701
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:53,568
No! No!

702
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:57,573
Get off me!
What have you done?

703
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:04,412
This is how they came out on the camera?
That's it.

704
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:08,417
Hmm. So was the camera
moving or...

705
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,920
no. See? The background and
the clothes are in focus.

706
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,922
Hmm. Laura,
would get that damn thing.

707
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:16,924
Take a look at the collar.

708
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,427
Mm-hmm.
Travis sheriff's department.

709
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:21,929
Where's ira? Horace?
What's going on?

710
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,433
There's a woman here. She said
she's the Brady kid's mother.

711
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,435
- I think she killed don robertson.
- Slow down.

712
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:31,440
There's blood everywhere!

713
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,947
No vegetables, no dessert.

714
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:40,949
Those are the rules.

715
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:44,953
Horace! What's going on there?
Hello, Horace?

716
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,456
Come on, Horace.
Answer the phone.

717
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:51,459
Are you there?

718
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:54,962
Horace?
Answer the damn phone!

719
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,965
Horace!

720
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:47,515
That woman over there, see?

721
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,518
Hold it, right there.

722
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:53,020
Put her down.

723
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:56,524
- Put the girl down.
- Give me back my daughter!

724
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,528
Put her down!

725
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:05,534
Oh!

726
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:13,040
Get soames!
Every man he has!

727
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,544
Castle rock too!

728
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:37,566
Put her down!
Drop the gun, lady... now!

729
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:06,595
Hello, dear.

730
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:10,598
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?

731
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,602
To see Charles, dear.
No!

732
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,104
No!

733
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,607
No! No!
Get back!

734
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:22,611
Let go of me!

735
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:25,614
Get in here, you bitch!

736
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,152
Oh, my God.

737
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:14,162
No!

738
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,188
Charles, my beautiful Charles!

739
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,191
Mommy's home.

740
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,698
See what mommy's brought you?

741
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,703
He's dead.

742
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,204
Look at him.
He's dead.

743
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:00,208
No! He'snotdead!

744
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:07,716
He's sleeping.
Can't you see he's sleeping?

745
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,721
You know what I bet
he'd love to do?

746
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:17,726
You'd like to dance,

747
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:20,729
wouldn't you, my darling?

748
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,762
That's his favorite song.

749
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,765
Did you know that?

750
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,268
I said, did you know that?

751
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:03,771
No.

752
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:06,774
Yes.
He's a wonderful dancer.

753
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:09,276
But you don't have to take
my word for it.

754
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,780
You can see for yourself.

755
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,281
What?

756
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:16,283
Dance with him.

757
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,285
Dance with...
with Charles.

758
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:21,790
Dance with my son.

759
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,807
Relax.

760
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,311
He's a wonderful dancer.

761
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:48,817
He'll lead.

762
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:59,326
No!
There!

763
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,830
That's it. Dance.

764
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:23,852
Clovis?

765
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:36,364
No, no!

766
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:43,371
No! No! No!

767
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,877
Yes! Now, Charles! Now!

768
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:05,893
Good! Good, Charles. Feed.

769
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:09,898
- Suck her dry!
- No!

770
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,401
Stop! You're killing him!

771
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,905
Die!

772
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:32,920
- No!
- Tanya, get out of there!

773
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:36,925
No! Help me!

774
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,435
Go!

775
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,939
No! Oh, my God!

776
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,960
Holy shit!

777
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:18,966
Wait, wait, wait, wait! No!
Now! Now! We've gotta go!

778
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,968
No!
Come on!

779
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:22,970
Wait!
Damn it!

780
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:26,975
Charles was dead, wasn't he?
Yes, he was dead! Yes! Let's go!

781
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:39,586
No!

782
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:52,500
No! No!

783
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:59,006
No! No!

784
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,509
Hey, mom!

785
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:23,031
Sheriff!

786
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,035
No! No!

787
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:33,041
Oh, come on!

788
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,555
Oh, God, help me!

789
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:50,558
Sheriff!

790
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,063
Oh, God.

791
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,104
You killed my son!
My only son!

792
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:07,635
Clovis.

793
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:19,146
It's just you and me, clovis.

794
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:21,149
Just you and me.

795
01:29:10,002 --> 01:29:11,364
