00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,678
You're very gracious, your Majesty.

Id rather not.

King?
...of the Jews, yes.

141
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:10,061
King of the Jew?
Am I missing something?

142
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,704
Did not you come here to
see the king of the Jews?

143

Are not you are looking at
Herod, king of the Jews?

144

Of course.

145

No one.
He's not born yet.

147
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,561
It is a prophecy,
heralded by the Star.

148

Surely your scribes would
receive revelation ...

Stars? Prophecies?

Come on ...

170
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:50,524
But I am the one
who brings peace!

171
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:54,661
Do you think some
child could do that?

172
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:03,804
Is it written where this mighty
prince would be born?

173
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:08,741
Micah says it will
be..  Bethlehem.

174
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,244
Bethlehem?

175
00:19:12,147 --> 00:19:13,380
Bethlehem!

176
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:15,683
Gather the troops!

177
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:30,497
Our son.

178
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,768
Praise be to God.

179
00:20:54,982 --> 00:21:00,951
Lady, I believe your Son is the
promised King of these people.

180
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:03,991
What is his name?

181
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:08,061
Jesus.

182
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:13,233
His name Jesus.

183
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:37,391
Mary!

184
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:39,359
Mary!

185
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,579
Mary!

186
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:02,250
Mary!

187
00:22:09,757 --> 00:22:11,791
We have to leave.
Now!

188
00:22:12,393 --> 00:22:15,495
I cant explain,
just trust me.

189
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:23,837
<i> When Herod hears a
a new king is being born in Bethlehem,</i>

190

<i> ... he orders the murder
of every infant boys. </i>

191
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:31,043
Kill any you find!

192
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:33,381
This way!

193
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:35,682

Hurry! Kill them all!

195

My son!

196
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,026
Get the boy!

197
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,128
Nooo!

198

<i> The massacre of the innocents. </i>

<i> One Child escapes. </i>

200
00:23:53,861 --> 00:23:55,628
<i> Herod will never know ... </i>

201
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,466
<i> ... that the slaughter in Bethlehem
was for nothing. </i>

202
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:02,336
<i> He's dying. </i>

203
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:04,271
<i> his last paranoid act,</i>

204

<i> ... execution of his eldest son
for plotting against it. </i>

205
00:24:17,785 --> 00:24:20,053
Father, please!

206
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,520
<i> When Herod dies, ... </i>

207

<i> Israel explodes. </i>

209
00:25:01,964 --> 00:25:04,897
<i> the Romans' response,
is brutal.</i>

210
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:16,343
Stay together!

211
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:47,474
<i> the uprising is crushed.</i>

212
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,749
<i> In Galilee alone,
two thousand are crucified. </i>

213
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,350
GALILEE

214
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,985
<i> Jesus and His family
returned from Egypt. </i>

215
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:09,723
There, Jesus.
We're almost home.

216
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:14,627
<i> A decade of darkness has
fallen over Israel. </i>

217

Joseph!

00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:52,966
What've they done?

219
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:55,802
We must trust in God's plan.

220
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,638
As He trusts in us.

221
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:28,339
25 YEARS LATER

222
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:36,843
<i> Rome has taken direct control
of Jerusalem and Judea. </i>

223

<i> ..awaits the arrival of the 4th Roman
governor in 20 years, </i>

225
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:49,222
<i> ... the arrogant and ruthless,
Pontius Pilate. </i>

226
00:28:57,264 --> 00:28:59,032
Greretings, Prefect.

227
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:01,401
Welcome to Judea.

228
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:04,804
I hope you're time here
will be prosperous and peaceful.

229
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:07,473
I intend to make sure it is.

230
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:12,178
Orders from Ceasar's, this descent
must stop.

231
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:15,081
<i> For Pilate and Antipas, ... </i>

232
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:17,951
<i> ... any gathering of people
is a threat. </i>

233
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:21,888
Repent and your sins
shall be forgiven!

234
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:24,924
<i> At the River Jordan, ... </i>

235
00:29:25,226 --> 00:29:27,827
<i> ... crowds flocked
to John the Baptist. </i>

236
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:31,931
I baptize you,
preparing for the new kingdom.

237
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,102
as you are cleansed ...

238
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:41,307
So all Israel ...
shall be cleansed!

239
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,309
Are you the Messiah?

240
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:46,079
Here. Im waiting.

241
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,841
You said there was trouble
In the desert ...

242
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:20,046
The people are flocking
to this wild  man, John.

243
00:30:20,148 --> 00:30:22,481
They think he's a prophet.

244
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:25,252
Some even call him the Messiah.

245
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:35,361
Do you truly repent?

246
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,663
God's ax is ready

247
00:30:37,765 --> 00:30:40,132
Every tree that does not
produce good fruit ...

248
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:43,003
Will cut down ...
and thrown into the fire.

249
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:50,877
All flesh shall see
the salvation of God!

250
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,146
And what is a Messiah?

251
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:55,348
the Redeemer of the Jews.

252
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:59,619
Anointed by God
to set them free.

253
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:10,496
Then you need to keep an eye on
your Messiah.

254
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:36,822
Then is One to come,
greater than me, ...

255
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:39,525
... Who will baptize with fire!

256
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:43,730
I'm just a voice in the wilderness,
preparing the way for the ...

257
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,274
... Lord.

258
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:03,449
Dont stop.

259
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:08,287
surely, I need
You to baptize me.

260
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:34,880
John, what you are doing is
right..

261
00:32:39,086 --> 00:32:40,753
Baptize Me.

262
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:22,862
<i> After his baptism, Jesus
enters the wilderness.</i>

263
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:29,936
<i> For 40 days, his spirit is tested, ... </i>

264
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:33,005
<i> ... preparing him to the
challenges to come. </i>

265
00:34:48,348 --> 00:34:50,016
Satan...

266
00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:03,929
If you are the Son of God, ...

267
00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:10,903
Command that ...
this stone becomes bread.

268
00:35:21,781 --> 00:35:26,986
Man shall not live by bread alone, ...

269
00:35:28,288 --> 00:35:32,324
But one very word ...
that comes from the mouth of God.

270
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:42,733
If God loves you,
throw yourself down, ...

271
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:46,705
His ... angels will lift you
up in their hands.

272
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,344
How dare you put God to the
test!

273
00:35:55,916 --> 00:36:00,252
If you will bow down and worship me, ...

274
00:36:02,188 --> 00:36:06,192
... I will give you the
whole world.

275
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:20,072
Crucify Him!

276
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:42,428
Get away from me, Satan!

277
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:53,839
I worship the Lord, my God, ...

278
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:59,178
and serve Him only!

279
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:18,831
<i> Jesus resists Satan's temptations, </i>

280

<i> ... and prepares to
begin His mission. </i>

281
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:25,004
<i> But it would be without
John the Baptist. </i>

282
00:37:25,206 --> 00:37:28,540
<i> He has been arrested by Antipas. </i>

283

Come on, scum!

284
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:36,849
Get in!

285
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,850
The Sea of Galilee

286
00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:34,700
Do you need help?

287
00:39:36,136 --> 00:39:38,504
Im in no need of any help.

288
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:42,675
Besides, nothing to help with.

289
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:03,829
Hey, what are you doing?

290
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:06,332
You cant just
climbed into my boat!

291
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:10,169
Yes, you're right.
Give me a helping hand.

292
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,625
What do you think you're doing?

293
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:34,193
We're going fishing.

294
00:40:34,295 --> 00:40:36,528
There are no fish out there,
this time of  day.

295
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,531
In fact, there are no fish out here
anytime the day.

296
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:40,699
Peter ...

297
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:44,370
just give me an hour, ...

298
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:48,039
And I will give you
a whole new life.

299
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:50,509
Who says I want one?

300
00:40:56,816 --> 00:41:02,521
I tell you,
there's no fish out there.

301
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:19,271
What am I going to do with you?

302
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:22,608
You and your dangerous mouth.

303
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,077
Listen.

304
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:30,714
To a sedicious fool?
I dont think so.

305
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:33,051
It's the God's message.

306
00:41:33,753 --> 00:41:36,488
"The kingdom of heaven is near!"

307
00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:40,292
So you do claimed to be the Messiah?

308
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:44,396
No.

309
00:41:44,798 --> 00:41:47,132
But you think he's coming?

310
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:50,502
No.

311
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:00,345
He's already here.

312
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:05,217
He's here.

313
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,421
Out there.

314
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:11,456
Speaking God's truth.

315
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:16,928
Opening the hearts of all men.

316

How did this happen?

317
00:43:30,703 --> 00:43:32,337
What did you do?

318
00:43:32,939 --> 00:43:36,241
I'm giving you the chance
to change your life.

319
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:44,783
Peter, come with me.

320
00:43:45,852 --> 00:43:51,220
Give up catching fish and
I will make you the fisher of men.

What are we gonna do?

322
00:43:57,997 --> 00:43:59,999
Change the world.

323

He will bring a new age of
righteousness and justice!

324
00:44:17,784 --> 00:44:23,153
His power will draw all men
to a new world! All people.....

SUNDAY
The week before Passover

<i> Passover is the biggest
Jewish festival of the year. </i>

00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,201
<i> ... from Egyptian slavery.</i>

330
00:45:39,644 --> 00:45:42,514
Look, it's Jesus!
Messiah!

331
00:45:44,216 --> 00:45:47,718
<i> Jesus's entrance, creates a storm.</i>

332
00:46:00,697 --> 00:46:04,600
<i> the prophet Zechariah predicted
that a new King of the Jews ... </i>

333
00:46:04,702 --> 00:46:07,704
<i> ... would enter the city
on a donkey.</i>

334
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:17,112
Messiah! Messiah!

335
00:46:18,514 --> 00:46:20,416
Messiah ...

336
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:39,901
Where is he now?

337
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:43,537
He's just entered the city,
on a donkey.

338
00:46:44,506 --> 00:46:48,075
"See, your king comes to you, ..."

339
00:46:48,077 --> 00:46:50,411
"... righteous and victorious, ..."

340
00:46:50,413 --> 00:46:54,348
"... humble and
riding on a  donkey. "

341
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,918
Where is he headed?
Towards the temple.

342
00:46:59,454 --> 00:47:04,525
This agitator from Galilee, he's a trouble

343
00:47:04,627 --> 00:47:08,261
the crowds, how're they
responding?

344
00:47:08,463 --> 00:47:10,130
And the Romans have never heard of them ?

345
00:47:10,232 --> 00:47:12,766
Yet.
No. So far.

346
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:18,072
He must not interfere
with Passover.

347
00:47:19,774 --> 00:47:24,443
God will bring His
wrath down upon all of usl.

348
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:27,847
And, who knows what Pilate
would do.

349
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:30,216
If the crowds ran out of control

350
00:47:30,618 --> 00:47:33,018
Nicodemus, go with Malchus.

351
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,155
If he enters the temple,
watch Him.

352
00:47:36,257 --> 00:47:40,693
Do not blink.
I need to know everything.

353
00:47:40,895 --> 00:47:42,162
Go.

354
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:14,759
The Kingdom is coming!

355
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:19,396
The Kingdom is coming!
Messiah!

356
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:23,533
It Barabbas.
Messiah!

357
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:27,938
King of Israel, why dont you make
us free?

358
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,308
Save us
from the Romans, Lord.

359
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,988
We come in peace, Barabbas.

360
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:59,401
Messiah!
Messiah!

361
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:08,877
Move! Get out of the way!
Get back!

362
00:49:35,436 --> 00:49:37,406
He's going to the temple!

363
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:54,988
<i> The temple is the holiest place
in the Bible. </i>

364
00:49:58,025 --> 00:50:01,227
<i> During the festival times,
selling sacrificial animal</i>

365
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:04,631
<i> ... and changing money has become
a thriving business. </i>

366
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:07,100
Did you exchange money?
Yes, yes.

367
00:50:09,803 --> 00:50:11,938
Exchange your money here!

368
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,707
Two, five ...

369
00:50:20,108 --> 00:50:22,008
Exchange here!

370
00:50:28,321 --> 00:50:30,088
What are you doing?

371
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,266
Jesus, please!

372
00:50:41,868 --> 00:50:43,769
Is it not written?

373
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:46,904
Wait!

374
00:50:49,074 --> 00:50:50,942
Is it not written?

375
00:50:52,044 --> 00:50:54,045
"My house ..."

376
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:58,849
"My house shall be called a
house of prayer. "

377
00:51:02,186 --> 00:51:03,887
But you ...

378
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:06,757
You have made it the
den of thieves.

379
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:09,693
Who are you to
tell us these?

380
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:21,103
We teach the law,
not you

381
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:26,008
You pray lofty prayers..

382
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:30,780
And love your shows of
piloting the temple.

383
00:51:35,084 --> 00:51:37,152
Hypocrites!

384
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:43,024
You can not
serve God and money.

385
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:05,513
This is outrageous.
and will it never help!

386
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:09,952
He's clever.
The crowd worship him.

387
00:52:11,254 --> 00:52:14,121
There is something
unusual about him.

388
00:52:14,223 --> 00:52:16,123
There is nothing
unusual about Him!

389
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:18,960
Apart from his ability
to cause havoc!

390
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,996
If He returns, challenge Him

391
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,131
Make his supporters
see their Messiah ...

392
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:28,035
for the  simple-minded peasant
that He is

393
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:42,036
MONDAY
4 DAYS TO PASSOVER

394
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,119
<i> In the week leading upto Passover, ... </i>

395
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:49,623
<i>Jewish pilgrims visit  ...
the temple daily. </i>

396
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,127
Alms for the poor!
God bless you.

397
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:59,233
<i> Jesus also returns to preach
to ever larger crowds. </i>

398
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:05,105
It is much harder for a rich
person ...

399
00:53:05,207 --> 00:53:07,440
To enter the
Kingdom of God

400
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:13,446
Than it is for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle.

401
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:18,318
The most  important thing is
that you should love your neighbor ...

402
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,453
As you love ...
yourself.

403
00:53:20,555 --> 00:53:22,822
Teacher!

404
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:28,228
They say you are learner.
So, tell us ...

405
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:30,329
Should we pay taxes?

406
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,600
To the Romans?

407
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,301
No! No!
No way!

408
00:53:40,706 --> 00:53:42,375
It's a trap.

409
00:53:45,678 --> 00:53:49,214
So, Teacher ...
should we?

410
00:53:49,316 --> 00:53:51,750
Pay the Romans taxes? or?

411
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:55,920
Do not pay!
Do not pay!

412
00:54:00,826 --> 00:54:05,529
Israel!
Israel!

413
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,500
Tell him!

414
00:54:10,101 --> 00:54:12,403
Whose face is on the coin?

415
00:54:13,305 --> 00:54:14,906
Ceasars.

416
00:54:20,711 --> 00:54:23,180
Then give to Caesar ...

417
00:54:25,149 --> 00:54:27,584
What is Ceasar's.

418
00:54:27,786 --> 00:54:29,821
And give to God ...

419
00:54:30,322 --> 00:54:32,622
What is God's.

420
00:54:35,226 --> 00:54:38,294
Messiah! Messiah!

421
00:54:58,114 --> 00:55:03,318
High Priest, that man,
there, with Jesus.

422
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,489
He approached me.
He wants to help us.

423
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:12,894
Really?
That could be useful.

424
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:33,481
You better get the better
of Him.

425
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:47,227
yet I may have
found the way to deal with him.

426
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:57,428
WEDNESDAY
2 DAYS TO PASSOVER

427
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:05,277
Teachers of the Law -
obey them.

428
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:09,148
Do everything
they tell you.

429
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,384
But dont do what
they do

430
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:16,321
They dont practice
what they preach.

431
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:21,160
Everything they do is done
for others to see.

432
00:56:22,528 --> 00:56:25,212
You only have one Father, ...

433
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:28,764
... And He is in heaven.

434
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:32,174
You only have one Teacher, ...

435
00:56:32,509 --> 00:56:37,149
and He is the Christ.

436
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:49,703
Messiah! Messiah!

437
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:10,307
Do you see all
these great buildings?

438
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:16,922
Not one stone of this place,
not one stone, ...

439
00:57:16,957 --> 00:57:19,201
... Will be left standing.

440
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:28,275
He said he would
destroy the temple!

441
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:36,190
He said what?

442
00:57:36,225 --> 00:57:40,354
Not one stone
will be left standing.

443
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:47,328
He threatens to
destroy the Temple.

444
00:57:48,863 --> 00:57:52,898
We must move swiftly,
but softly.

445
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:57,713
We can not arrest Him openly
or his supporters will run wild .

446
00:57:57,948 --> 00:58:01,166
No, not at the Passover,
No!

447
00:58:05,846 --> 00:58:12,603
We must bring him in quietly,
That night before Passover.

448
00:58:14,354 --> 00:58:15,850
Malchus, what's the name

449
00:58:15,852 --> 00:58:19,568
of that follower of His
that you pointed out to me ?

450
00:58:19,603 --> 00:58:23,781
Judas, High Priest.
Judas, yes ...

451
00:58:25,365 --> 00:58:27,510
Bring him to me.

452
00:58:27,945 --> 00:58:29,620
Here.

453
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:44,921
PILATE'S RESIDENCE

454
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:48,562
Sir.
We're eating!

455
00:58:48,797 --> 00:58:53,394
Sir, a Jew has
been causing trouble in the temple.

456
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:55,144
So?

457
00:58:55,979 --> 00:58:58,265
Yesterday he attacked
the money changers.

458
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,152
Today he says
would destroy the temple.

459
00:59:05,347 --> 00:59:08,593
He has a large number of supporters.

460
00:59:11,253 --> 00:59:12,553
What's his name?

461
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:15,674
They call him
Jesus of Nazareth.

462
00:59:15,809 --> 00:59:18,298
My servants talk about Him.

463
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,753
He's  canvass is vesmus

464
00:59:20,988 --> 00:59:22,990
But you keep an eye of the crowds

465
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:25,534
if they started to get out of hand,
I'll shut the temple

466
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:28,412
Festival or no
festival

467
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:18,731
Rabbi ...

468
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:25,072
I am Nicodemus.

469
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:32,278
Welcome.
I came here of my own accord.

470
01:00:32,313 --> 01:00:35,391
The High Priest knows nothing of this

471
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:41,144
What is he doing here?

472
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:44,833
Surely he does not want to
sit with us.

473
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,143
Judas.

474
01:01:12,276 --> 01:01:17,257
Your friend from Galilee
has caused quite  stir.

475
01:01:31,086 --> 01:01:33,471
One can not deny that he has
followers ...

476
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:37,744
Especially amongst the ...
less well educated element

477
01:01:38,879 --> 01:01:41,764
But you, Judas ...

478
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:45,559
I'm intrigued

479
01:01:47,895 --> 01:01:51,673
He ... he has the power.

480
01:01:53,183 --> 01:01:55,511
It's hard for me to put into words.

481
01:01:55,646 --> 01:01:59,306
The power to cause trouble.

482
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:02,126
To stir things up.

483
01:02:06,071 --> 01:02:08,832
Attacking money changers, ...

484
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:14,180
Threatening to ...
destroy the temple, ...

485
01:02:14,415 --> 01:02:17,466
the Holy of holies.

486
01:02:18,717 --> 01:02:24,181
If He were the Son of God,

487
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:27,025
If

488
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,872
Would he abuse
the house of the God

489
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:39,380
the true Messiah will unite Israel ,
not divide it

490
01:02:41,615 --> 01:02:43,659
What do you want with him?

491
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:47,112
Just talk .

492
01:02:48,706 --> 01:02:55,329
If the Romans step in
can you imagine the slaughter?

493
01:02:57,798 --> 01:03:01,285
It would mean
the end of the temple

494
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,173
the end ... of our faith

495
01:03:04,508 --> 01:03:07,991
the end ... of our nation .

496
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:11,837
Is that what you want , Judas?

497
01:03:13,272 --> 01:03:18,886
Judas , you are His friend.
Bring him here.

498
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:21,046
Discreetly

499
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:28,270
Let us try to stop this,
while we still can

500
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:35,504
And what's in it for me

501
01:03:47,347 --> 01:03:49,398
Good

502
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:53,353
We shall expect to hear from
you presently

503
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:59,027
They say you can
perform miracles .

504
01:04:00,662 --> 01:04:04,031
That you have seen
Kingdom of God

505
01:04:05,924 --> 01:04:09,461
You can see the kingdom of God .

506
01:04:12,372 --> 01:04:15,183
But you must
born again .

507
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:21,048
Born again?
How can you be born? again ?

508
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:25,906
You must be reborn..

509
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:28,537
not in the flesh ..

510
01:04:28,772 --> 01:04:31,534
... but in spirit .

511
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:51,474
The wind blows where it wishes .

512
01:04:51,509 --> 01:04:54,723
you wont know where it comes from

513
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:58,177
or where it goes

514
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:05,985
And so it is, when the
Spirit enters you

515
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:13,273
God so loved the world

516
01:05:13,308 --> 01:05:17,854
That He gave His One and Only son

517
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:25,337
Believe in Him,
and you will have eternal life

518
01:05:37,341 --> 01:05:39,593
<i> The Closer it gets to Passover ,</i>

519
01:05:39,628 --> 01:05:42,229
<i> ... the tenser it gets in Jerusalem. </i>

520
01:05:43,764 --> 01:05:47,242
<i> Just 30 years ago, the Romans
killed thousands,</i>

521
01:05:47,377 --> 01:05:50,021
<i> ... during  Passover demonstrations.</i>

522
01:05:51,056 --> 01:05:54,667
Roman thieves!
Roman scums!

523
01:06:13,327 --> 01:06:18,423
This is a mess!
I must inform Pilates

524
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:30,576
Since Ive been prefects,

525
01:06:31,011 --> 01:06:34,840
You Jews, have tested my
patience to breaking point

526
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,760
Now i beowned it..
yes but..

527
01:06:37,895 --> 01:06:39,754
Im speaking!

528
01:06:41,788 --> 01:06:44,992
If the disturbances that took place
today are repeated tomorrow

529
01:06:45,027 --> 01:06:47,452
I will shut the temple
immediately

530
01:06:47,487 --> 01:06:49,194
there will be no
Passover

531
01:06:49,229 --> 01:06:51,582
I will put this city
under curfew

532
01:06:51,617 --> 01:06:54,918
I will crush any rebellion

533
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,048
Do I make myself
absolutely clear

534
01:08:19,044 --> 01:08:21,595
We thank you Lord

535
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:26,118
by whose word, everything
comes to be

536
01:08:26,253 --> 01:08:28,345
Amen.

537
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:53,870
This is our last meal together

538
01:08:56,706 --> 01:08:59,668
..before I die

539
01:09:06,066 --> 01:09:08,327
What do you mean?

540
01:09:10,262 --> 01:09:14,508
I'm going to be betrayed to my enemies

541
01:09:15,343 --> 01:09:17,477
arrested..

542
01:09:19,346 --> 01:09:21,898
..and condemned to death

543
01:09:35,286 --> 01:09:38,231
Malchus, any word from
Judas?

544
01:09:39,266 --> 01:09:41,560
Nothing, High Priest.

545
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,219
I wont wait it even much longer

546
01:09:45,654 --> 01:09:50,126
Malchus, we arrest this false
prophet tonight.

547
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:56,898
How do we know
He is a false prophet ?

548
01:09:57,533 --> 01:10:02,697
Has he fulfilled any of the signs
of a true Messiah?

549
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:05,842
as its written in our scriptures?

550
01:10:07,084 --> 01:10:10,146
Well, Nicodemus, has he?

551
01:10:15,309 --> 01:10:18,836
He will be tried
according to our law.

552
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:22,959
we remove this man, or the Romans
will destroy everything

553
01:10:23,394 --> 01:10:26,788
Removed ?
Executed ?

554
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:30,182
Yes , Nicodemus .

555
01:10:31,617 --> 01:10:37,265
the life of one peasant for the
future of God's nation

556
01:10:52,004 --> 01:10:55,007
Dont be afraid

557
01:10:56,967 --> 01:10:59,344
trust in God

558
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,475
trust in Me also

559
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:09,550
you know the way to where
Im going

560
01:11:09,685 --> 01:11:13,082
we dont know where You're
going, how come we know the way?

561
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:20,157
the Truth ... and ...

562
01:11:21,809 --> 01:11:24,362
the Life..

563
01:11:35,464 --> 01:11:37,683
Take it.

564
01:11:41,887 --> 01:11:44,356
Eat..

565
01:11:58,403 --> 01:12:00,214
This,

566
01:12:02,324 --> 01:12:05,336
this is my body...

567
01:12:29,518 --> 01:12:32,454
This is my blood

568
01:12:39,236 --> 01:12:44,482
Remember Me by
Doing this.

569
01:12:45,575 --> 01:12:48,761
Im going to the Father

570
01:12:48,996 --> 01:12:52,416
and I'll always be with you..

571
01:12:57,379 --> 01:13:00,773
But now, I must tell you..

572
01:13:01,008 --> 01:13:06,638
That one of you here,
will betray Me.

573
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,794
Who?

574
01:13:22,988 --> 01:13:26,609
Whoever eats this.

575
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,303
Im not,

576
01:13:29,645 --> 01:13:33,057
I will not betray you..

577
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,145
Do it quickly.

578
01:13:55,353 --> 01:13:57,348
Let him go .

579
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,993
You will all fall away

580
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:57,975
Rabbi,

581
01:15:00,043 --> 01:15:02,738
I will not fall away.

582
01:15:09,494 --> 01:15:12,531
I will lay down my life
for you..

583
01:15:13,266 --> 01:15:14,984
Will you?

584
01:15:16,793 --> 01:15:18,996
I will.

585
01:15:38,231 --> 01:15:42,118
Peter, I tell you,

586
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,539
before dawn..

587
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:52,036
you will deny me,
three times..

588
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:32,760
Judas . Where is He?
I...

589
01:16:32,795 --> 01:16:35,473
Do you know where He is now?

590
01:16:37,408 --> 01:16:39,481
I know where He going

591
01:16:40,216 --> 01:16:42,354
Lead my servant

592
01:17:03,555 --> 01:17:07,355
Garden Of Gethsemane

593
01:17:25,146 --> 01:17:29,117
Wake up!
And keep awake.

594
01:17:29,352 --> 01:17:31,444
The time has come

595
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:38,910
the Spirit is willing ,
but the flesh is weak

596
01:17:40,453 --> 01:17:43,331
I must pray.

597
01:17:57,846 --> 01:17:59,889
Father..

598
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:03,852
Father..

599
01:18:07,981 --> 01:18:10,108
I know,

600
01:18:11,885 --> 01:18:14,598
It must be

601
01:18:15,299 --> 01:18:17,499
as You will it

602
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:22,279
Father,
Take this from Me,

603
01:18:22,514 --> 01:18:24,689
Spare Me!

604
01:18:26,749 --> 01:18:30,804
Lord , I know
You are pleased with me, ...

605
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:35,465
for You sustain me in
sincerity

606
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:41,623
We thank you, our Ancestors,
for watching over us.

607
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:46,927
Father..

608
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:53,617
Praise the Lord,
God of Israel

609
01:18:54,152 --> 01:19:01,534
everlasting and everlasting
Amen and Amen,

610
01:19:16,758 --> 01:19:20,637
if You will it, Father

611
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:28,445
if You will it,

612
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:32,315
Your will

613
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:36,277
is mine

614
01:20:07,225 --> 01:20:09,636
Do what you came for

615
01:20:18,611 --> 01:20:20,147
Traitor!!

616
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:27,212
Take Him!

617
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:31,666
No! Jesus!

618
01:20:35,111 --> 01:20:40,189
Run! Jesus!
Run ! Run , Jesus !

619
01:20:40,224 --> 01:20:41,888
Peter !

620
01:20:42,989 --> 01:20:45,189
He who lives by the sword,

621
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:47,916
dies by the sword...

622
01:21:38,642 --> 01:21:40,852
Run!

623
01:21:42,745 --> 01:21:44,989
Come on you who!

624
01:21:45,324 --> 01:21:46,935
Take Him back

625
01:21:50,735 --> 01:21:52,747
What about this one?

626
01:21:53,448 --> 01:21:54,948
Get out of here!

627
01:21:57,293 --> 01:21:58,910
Come on !

628
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:01,522
I wont leave Him! Peter!

629
01:22:01,857 --> 01:22:03,557
Come on!

630
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:06,819
Come on , Mary!

631
01:22:23,528 --> 01:22:24,828
Get up!
Enough!

632
01:22:24,929 --> 01:22:26,590
Keep Him moving

633
01:22:44,865 --> 01:22:46,451
Drag Him...

634
01:22:49,336 --> 01:22:52,482
tell Caiaphas we have Jesus,
Yes Sir,

635
01:22:53,517 --> 01:22:54,985
Yes Sir,
not you

636
01:23:08,508 --> 01:23:11,094
" Therefore, night trials
involving death penalty , ... "

637
01:23:11,129 --> 01:23:13,596
may not be held on the eve of
Sabbath

638
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:16,615
or on the eve of a feast day "

639
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:20,337
The best scholars say, we must hold
our trials by daylight

640
01:23:20,472 --> 01:23:22,914
but the trial is tonight

641
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:48,448
You can not confer this,
it is not legal

642
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:52,086
Our scholars say, it must be in court,
in daylight and public

643
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:53,788
It is necessary.
Why the rush?

644
01:24:53,823 --> 01:24:55,265
You know why.

645
01:24:55,514 --> 01:24:57,856
Pilate will close the
temple.

646
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:01,571
We must be rid of this
Jesus.

647
01:25:03,506 --> 01:25:06,808
But what if He really is
who they say He is?

648
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:12,257
We are to decide precisely that..
now with God's guidance.

649
01:25:12,392 --> 01:25:14,240
God demands we obey the law!

650
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:17,203
Let me remind you
what the law says:

651
01:25:17,438 --> 01:25:20,079
"Anyone who shows contempt

652
01:25:20,111 --> 01:25:24,252
for the judge or for the priest, shall
be put to death"

653
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:26,322
Anyone!

654
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:45,271
Tell me, speak to me

655
01:25:45,606 --> 01:25:47,725
why letting them do this
to you?

656
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,159
no, no. no
get back

657
01:25:49,194 --> 01:25:50,737
have you seen the man they arrested?

658
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:52,480
have you seen the man they arrested?!

659
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:52,482
Get back!

660
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:11,422
Brothers and sisters, thank you for
coming to this hour

661
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:16,571
You know I would not have ask
you, if it were not so serious

662
01:26:18,164 --> 01:26:19,741
Ah...

663
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:42,989
Get Him up..

664
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:50,671
Jesus of Nazareth

665
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:56,110
You are charged ...
with blasphemy .

666
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:25,763
Mary?

667
01:27:26,198 --> 01:27:28,409
Oh, Mary...

668
01:27:32,663 --> 01:27:35,633
What has happened ?
Where is my son?

669
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:38,824
Jesus has been arrested?
Arrested ?

670
01:27:38,959 --> 01:27:41,973
We did not know where
they could've taken him .

671
01:27:42,408 --> 01:27:44,076
arrested?

672
01:27:44,211 --> 01:27:45,709
at night?

673
01:27:46,244 --> 01:27:50,097
They want to keep it secret..
they dont want any protest..

674
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:58,955
He has employed demons
to heal.

675
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:06,614
He has threatened to
destroy the temple of our Lord

676
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:15,289
brothers, we must
listen before we judge

677
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:23,631
And so I invite, the Prophet,
to speak.

678
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:30,422
Tell us the message You bring
from God

679
01:28:40,539 --> 01:28:42,324
Nothing?

680
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:46,045
Nothing to say?
Surely.

681
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:50,399
Tell us this ...

682
01:28:51,534 --> 01:28:55,329
Are You The Chosen One?

683
01:28:57,064 --> 01:29:00,485
Are you the Son of God?

684
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,507
I am.

685
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:17,126
And you will see Me coming
with the clouds of heaven

686
01:29:17,261 --> 01:29:19,620
... sitting at the right hand of God .

687
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:22,082
This is repulsive!

688
01:29:22,117 --> 01:29:24,760
With God? Impartia!

689
01:29:24,995 --> 01:29:27,603
Fool! Blasphemer!

690
01:29:33,742 --> 01:29:35,910
We have heard enough!

691
01:29:36,645 --> 01:29:39,784
There is only one verdict

692
01:29:41,619 --> 01:29:43,428
Guilty .

693
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,740
This is wrong!

694
01:29:58,475 --> 01:30:01,354
This brings shame on our
consent.

695
01:30:01,789 --> 01:30:04,715
Does it not? Brothers,

696
01:30:06,609 --> 01:30:08,970
the sentence is death.

697
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:23,870
JERUSALEM
12 DAYS TO PASSOVER

698
01:30:45,645 --> 01:30:48,503
You're Passover robes,
High Priest.

699
01:30:48,782 --> 01:30:52,416
The sentence is death but it can not
be by stoning.

700
01:30:55,322 --> 01:30:56,917
That's penalty for
blasphemy

701
01:30:57,090 --> 01:30:58,557
the crowds..

702
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:01,854
he has thousands
of supporters

703
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:02,900
it could be disastrous,

704
01:31:02,901 --> 01:31:05,193
I dare not risk it.

705
01:31:12,495 --> 01:31:14,004
Pilate.

706
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:16,507
Pilate could do it .

707
01:31:16,508 --> 01:31:17,707
He has the authority .

708
01:31:17,778 --> 01:31:20,208
Why would Romans
execute Jesus?

709
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:22,878
Pilate is charged with keeping
peace in Judea.

710
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:25,077
It's in our common interest .

711
01:31:26,453 --> 01:31:28,821
I must make him see that.

712
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:58,213
Let it be known ! Jesus of Nazareth
has been tried ...

713
01:31:58,418 --> 01:32:01,715
... by Supreme Court of Elders .

714
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:06,619
And He has been found guilty
blasphemy , ...

715
01:32:06,727 --> 01:32:09,924
and of threatening to ...
destroy the Temple .

716
01:32:11,065 --> 01:32:13,133
What do you want with him ?

717
01:32:13,233 --> 01:32:14,598
Just talk.

718
01:32:25,913 --> 01:32:28,577
The sentence...

719
01:32:28,782 --> 01:32:29,806
... is death!

720
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:36,146
You ! Take back your money !

721
01:32:49,603 --> 01:32:51,062
You .

722
01:32:51,872 --> 01:32:55,369
I 've seen you before .
You know him .

723
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:02,146
No.

724
01:33:03,016 --> 01:33:04,480
I dont know him .

725
01:33:04,551 --> 01:33:05,982
You call him Rabbi .

726
01:33:06,486 --> 01:33:08,384
He's nothing to do with me .

727
01:33:08,556 --> 01:33:11,290
You know him .
I've seen you with Him .

728
01:33:14,494 --> 01:33:16,123
I dont know him .

729
01:33:21,301 --> 01:33:22,734
<i> Peter , ... </i>

730
01:33:23,236 --> 01:33:26,469
<i> ... you will deny me
three times . </i>

731
01:33:31,478 --> 01:33:33,542
<i> Dont be afraid .</i>

732
01:33:33,747 --> 01:33:35,708
Take him to Pilate !

733
01:33:45,158 --> 01:33:47,149
Where is my wife ?
It's late .

734
01:33:48,595 --> 01:33:51,227
Please come Sir, come quickly!

735
01:33:57,337 --> 01:33:58,971
Claudia , what?

736
01:33:59,139 --> 01:34:00,671
I ...

737
01:34:01,274 --> 01:34:03,005
I saw a man ...

738
01:34:04,778 --> 01:34:06,373
... in a dream.

739
01:34:06,746 --> 01:34:09,215
a man being beaten ...

740
01:34:09,716 --> 01:34:11,406
... and killed .

741
01:34:11,884 --> 01:34:14,053
an innocent man!

742
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:17,389
A holy man .

743
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:25,095
A good man .

744
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:31,200
Help Claudia back to bed .
No!

745
01:34:37,477 --> 01:34:40,345
It was you who killed him .

746
01:35:08,275 --> 01:35:10,272
<i> One of you here ... </i>

747
01:35:11,511 --> 01:35:13,172
<i> ... will betray me . </i>

748
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:54,519
Sir , the High Priest Caiaphas and his
elders are here to see you .

749
01:36:02,796 --> 01:36:05,126
Prefect , good morning .

750
01:36:07,634 --> 01:36:10,831
Prefect , we need your help .

751
01:36:12,305 --> 01:36:16,241
We have convicted a
dangerous criminal.

752
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:18,368
His sentence must be death.

753
01:36:18,478 --> 01:36:21,174
So?
Execute him.

754
01:36:21,948 --> 01:36:23,546
We can not .

755
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:25,850
This close to Passover , ...

756
01:36:26,153 --> 01:36:28,453
... it will make us impure.

757
01:36:28,655 --> 01:36:30,716
So do it after Passover .

758
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:34,419
He is an immediate threat ...

759
01:36:35,028 --> 01:36:38,028
... not only to us ,
but to you..

760
01:36:38,431 --> 01:36:41,461
This is a tense time ...

761
01:36:41,835 --> 01:36:43,626
When my people celebrate ...

762
01:36:43,737 --> 01:36:47,864
their deliverance from
past  oppressors,

763
01:36:49,242 --> 01:36:52,006
He claims ...
to be our king .

764
01:36:52,378 --> 01:36:55,436
And is sweeping up  the crowds
into a rebellion .

765
01:36:55,815 --> 01:36:59,349
Rebellion that could
tear Jerusalem apart.

766
01:37:00,954 --> 01:37:03,285
Ceasar would not be pleased .

767
01:37:05,525 --> 01:37:09,417
His name ?
Jesus of Nazareth .

768
01:37:12,365 --> 01:37:15,027
You better not be
wasting my time .

769
01:37:17,871 --> 01:37:19,736
I 'll see the prisoner .

770
01:37:37,557 --> 01:37:39,917
You ! Stop ! Please!

771
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:42,257
Please! Wait!! Please!

772
01:37:42,462 --> 01:37:44,421
You know Jesus .
You spoke to Him.

773
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:46,665
Please, where's my son ?

774
01:37:48,068 --> 01:37:50,059
He's gone .
Gone? Where ?

775
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,837
No.
Please .

776
01:37:54,173 --> 01:37:56,772
the Romans have Him .
The Romans?

777
01:37:57,043 --> 01:38:00,035
He's never said anything
against Romans.

778
01:38:16,963 --> 01:38:18,287
So ...

779
01:38:19,366 --> 01:38:20,990
Tell me who You are .

780
01:38:22,202 --> 01:38:25,000
Are you the King of the Jews ?

781
01:38:25,205 --> 01:38:27,339
are you  asking?

782
01:38:28,175 --> 01:38:31,207
or is it a question coming
from others?

783
01:38:33,847 --> 01:38:35,942
Are You a king ?

784
01:38:36,349 --> 01:38:39,380
That's what Your own people and
chief priests ...

785
01:38:39,486 --> 01:38:41,784
tell me You claimed to be.

786
01:38:42,789 --> 01:38:44,484
My kingdom ...

787
01:38:46,059 --> 01:38:48,118
... is not of this world .

788
01:38:49,629 --> 01:38:51,519
If it were , ...

789
01:38:51,865 --> 01:38:55,465
my servant would fight for arrest.

790
01:39:00,307 --> 01:39:03,333
My kingdom is from another place .

791
01:39:23,496 --> 01:39:25,694
You are a king then,

792
01:39:25,765 --> 01:39:28,925
You say ,
that I am a king .

793
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:32,604
I have been born

794
01:39:32,706 --> 01:39:34,606
... and come into the world , ...

795
01:39:34,708 --> 01:39:37,409
to testify to the Truth .

796
01:39:37,711 --> 01:39:40,643
Everyone on the side
of truth ...

797
01:39:41,681 --> 01:39:44,081
... listens to me.

798
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:45,776
Truth?

799
01:39:46,853 --> 01:39:49,014
What is a truth ?

800
01:40:07,673 --> 01:40:08,904
That's Him.

801
01:40:09,775 --> 01:40:12,139
The Man I saw in my dream .
That's Him!

802
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,643
They want Him crucified .

803
01:40:15,749 --> 01:40:17,216
but you cant .

804
01:40:18,318 --> 01:40:20,718
they say
He could start a revolution .

805
01:40:20,787 --> 01:40:22,084
You musnt !

806
01:40:22,155 --> 01:40:26,851
If dont, Caiaphas would blame
any rebellion on me .

807
01:40:27,126 --> 01:40:30,284
Ceasar will see it
as my failure.

808
01:40:30,397 --> 01:40:33,761
He's warned me once.
He's not going to warn me again .

809
01:40:35,502 --> 01:40:37,436
I'll be finished.

810
01:40:39,239 --> 01:40:41,070
We'll be finished.

811
01:41:14,474 --> 01:41:17,243
He's guilty of nothing
more than being deluded

812
01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:19,141
He has broken the law

813
01:41:19,346 --> 01:41:22,208
Your law, not Ceasar's .

814
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:26,780
get Him out and teach Him
some respect.

815
01:41:27,253 --> 01:41:29,218
Forty lashes !

816
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:32,290
Forty lashes ?

817
01:41:33,326 --> 01:41:34,994
Nothing more?

818
01:41:38,164 --> 01:41:39,695
Prefect ...

819
01:41:40,233 --> 01:41:43,031
We can not be held responsible ...

820
01:41:43,136 --> 01:41:46,970
... for what the people may do
today, ...

821
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,975
with their eyes on
God,

822
01:41:50,043 --> 01:41:52,238
if you release a man

823
01:41:52,345 --> 01:41:56,475
who has broken
our sacred laws .

824
01:41:58,017 --> 01:41:59,507
the people?

825
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:05,350
Ceasar decrees ...

826
01:42:05,425 --> 01:42:09,054
I can release ...
a prisoner at  the Passover .

827
01:42:09,162 --> 01:42:12,226
Let the people decide which of the
prisoners I hold..

828
01:42:12,331 --> 01:42:14,591
... would be crucified.

829
01:42:31,217 --> 01:42:32,912
Come on !

830
01:42:36,089 --> 01:42:38,781
Step your feet !
Come on !

831
01:42:42,695 --> 01:42:43,885
Come on !

832
01:42:45,165 --> 01:42:47,692
Here!
Faster!

833
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:53,532
What have they
done to him  ?

834
01:43:08,486 --> 01:43:10,280
They're gonna kill Him !

835
01:43:43,156 --> 01:43:46,389
It's as if He knows this must
happen.

836
01:46:06,332 --> 01:46:08,664
So you are a king .

837
01:46:11,738 --> 01:46:14,332
Every king needs a crown .

838
01:46:23,016 --> 01:46:24,447
Get up !

839
01:46:47,874 --> 01:46:49,273
Let them in .

840
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:56,007
Yes. You .
You and you .

Wait there /
No, not you . Back . Back !

844
01:47:08,294 --> 01:47:12,060
No! Step back!
Not you .No pushing!

845
01:47:12,298 --> 01:47:13,632
Do not push !

846
01:47:14,001 --> 01:47:16,028
Let us through . /
Let me through!

847
01:47:16,503 --> 01:47:18,937
Get back !
No. No.

848
01:47:19,472 --> 01:47:21,235
Yes.
No.

849
01:47:28,514 --> 01:47:30,139
Close the gate !

850
01:47:30,650 --> 01:47:33,710
Hey ! Mary !
Mary. Move .

851
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:35,549
Move! Let's go!

852
01:47:53,706 --> 01:47:55,797
Today, Passover begins .

853
01:47:56,542 --> 01:47:58,542
And your emperor,
Tiberius Caesar, ...

854
01:47:58,744 --> 01:48:01,274
makes you a gesture
of goodwill..

855
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:03,807
The release of a prisoner..

856
01:48:04,016 --> 01:48:06,746
... chosen by you .

857
01:48:07,286 --> 01:48:09,586
I give you a choice .

858
01:48:10,289 --> 01:48:11,850
Barabbas .

859
01:48:11,924 --> 01:48:14,687
a dangerous agitator,

860
01:48:15,194 --> 01:48:17,025
... a murderer..

861
01:48:18,464 --> 01:48:19,861
Or this preacher , ...

862
01:48:22,668 --> 01:48:25,129
... who claims to be your King.

863
01:48:29,709 --> 01:48:32,734
He's not our king !

864
01:48:40,486 --> 01:48:44,217
We  have no
King but Caesar .

865
01:48:46,058 --> 01:48:47,782
You must decide .

866
01:48:51,163 --> 01:48:53,457
We chose Barabbas .

867
01:48:53,633 --> 01:48:56,332
Release Barabbas .
Barabbas .

868
01:48:58,838 --> 01:49:00,572
Release Barabbas .
Barabbas .

869
01:49:02,642 --> 01:49:04,034
Give us Barabbas !

870
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:06,437
Release Barabbas !
Barabbas!

871
01:49:06,512 --> 01:49:08,639
Barabbas ! Barabbas !

872
01:49:08,748 --> 01:49:11,444
Jesus! Jesus!

873
01:49:11,517 --> 01:49:14,452
Barabbas ! Barabbas !

874
01:49:19,492 --> 01:49:21,787
You choose a murderer?

875
01:49:22,694 --> 01:49:25,022
Give us Barabbas !

876
01:49:28,534 --> 01:49:30,024
Do it!

877
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:36,432
Go!

878
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,204
And the prophet ?

879
01:49:42,715 --> 01:49:47,447
How could this blasphemer
be our king ?

880
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:51,549
He's a liar !
He's not our king !

881
01:49:51,724 --> 01:49:53,552
Crucify Him!

882
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:58,157
Crucify Him !
Kill him !

883
01:49:58,231 --> 01:49:59,698
Crucify Him !

884
01:49:59,799 --> 01:50:02,461
Spare Him!
Save Him!

885
01:50:02,535 --> 01:50:05,026
Kill Him !
Crucify Him !

886
01:50:05,137 --> 01:50:07,230
Crucify Him!

887
01:50:09,008 --> 01:50:12,171
Crucify Him !
Crucify Him !

888
01:50:14,347 --> 01:50:16,274
Crucify Him !

889
01:50:16,549 --> 01:50:20,617
How can you condemn this Man
and spare a murderer?

890
01:50:21,254 --> 01:50:22,915
Crucify Him !

891
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:26,049
Blasphemer !

892
01:50:29,695 --> 01:50:32,593
Crucify Him !
Crucify Him !

893
01:50:36,235 --> 01:50:37,896
Very well!

894
01:50:40,606 --> 01:50:42,096
Crucify Him !

895
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,515
Crucify the blasphemer !

896
01:50:50,283 --> 01:50:51,841
Let Him die !

897
01:50:56,022 --> 01:50:57,717
No!

898
01:51:13,372 --> 01:51:15,397
You! Back!

899
01:51:15,741 --> 01:51:17,134
Get back!

900
01:52:01,153 --> 01:52:03,080
Release him !

901
01:52:14,233 --> 01:52:15,793
Move!

902
01:52:28,313 --> 01:52:29,979
Roman scum!

903
01:52:31,383 --> 01:52:33,710
How can they
treat Him like this ?

904
01:52:41,494 --> 01:52:44,595
John , I need to see Him .

905
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:46,695
I need to see my Son.
Get back !

906
01:52:46,999 --> 01:52:49,461

907

910
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:15,017
Hosanna !

01:53:26,005 --> 01:53:27,565
Move!

912
01:53:28,674 --> 01:53:32,269
This is so wrong , how can
they treat Him like that ?

913
01:53:32,478 --> 01:53:33,802
Get back!!

914
01:53:33,913 --> 01:53:35,278
Roman murderer !

915
01:53:50,463 --> 01:53:53,523
Not ! Jesus !
Somebody help Him !

916
01:53:53,799 --> 01:53:55,396
Show Him mercy !

917
01:53:57,403 --> 01:53:58,898
No!

918
01:53:59,505 --> 01:54:01,530
Get back! Get back!

919
01:54:04,176 --> 01:54:05,876
My Son ...

920
01:54:07,413 --> 01:54:09,704
Dont be afraid .

921
01:54:09,982 --> 01:54:14,419
Everything is possible
wtih God..

922
01:54:33,939 --> 01:54:35,270
Move forward!

923
01:54:36,909 --> 01:54:38,843
Jesus ! Jesus !

924
01:54:39,145 --> 01:54:41,204
Please, she's His mother !

925
01:54:53,826 --> 01:54:55,016
Hey !

926
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:04,098
Get back!

927
01:55:07,406 --> 01:55:08,637

928
01:55:11,343 --> 01:55:13,444

You !

931
01:55:26,484 --> 01:55:27,884
You !

932
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:30,157
Help Him carry the cross !

933
01:55:30,529 --> 01:55:31,996
Fast !

934
01:55:38,036 --> 01:55:39,431
My Lord ...

935
01:56:32,691 --> 01:56:37,025
What will the sign of
His cross say, Prefect?

936
01:56:41,333 --> 01:56:44,933
Put in Aramaic ,
Latin and Greek -

937
01:56:45,104 --> 01:56:49,040
" Jesus of Nazareth ,
the King of the Jews . "

938
01:56:49,108 --> 01:56:51,372
He was never
our king .

939
01:56:51,543 --> 01:56:55,436
And it must read ,
" This man said ... "

940
01:56:55,547 --> 01:56:57,747
" ... I am King of the Jews . "

941
01:56:57,850 --> 01:57:02,544
It stays as I've  commanded .
"the King of the Jews . "

942
01:57:28,514 --> 01:57:30,345
Cowards !

943
01:57:56,842 --> 01:57:58,235
Go away!

944
01:57:59,044 --> 01:58:00,511
Go !

945
01:58:39,485 --> 01:58:41,050
Thank you .

946
01:59:03,375 --> 01:59:04,537
Come on !

947
01:59:11,417 --> 01:59:13,747
Come on ! Move !

948
01:59:16,753 --> 01:59:17,986
Move it!

949
01:59:22,661 --> 01:59:23,826
Move!

950
01:59:24,229 --> 01:59:26,720
Come on !
Hey , come on !

951
01:59:30,302 --> 01:59:31,999
Faster ! Move!

952
01:59:34,104 --> 01:59:35,469
Come on !

953
02:00:02,368 --> 02:00:05,062
You ! Leave!
Leave!

954
02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:06,396
Move!

955
02:00:10,742 --> 02:00:12,601
Come on , King !

956
02:00:12,911 --> 02:00:14,440
Come on !

957
02:00:17,783 --> 02:00:19,673
Come on .
Come on !

958
02:00:37,936 --> 02:00:39,826
Get Him up on the cross !

959
02:00:42,841 --> 02:00:44,331
Come on !

960
02:00:45,978 --> 02:00:47,342
Over there .

961
02:01:35,794 --> 02:01:37,059
Pull the rope!

962
02:02:41,926 --> 02:02:43,322
Faster !

963
02:03:13,625 --> 02:03:15,886
You're going to
regret this .

964
02:03:16,962 --> 02:03:19,624
Hardly the first Jew
we've killed.

965
02:03:20,699 --> 02:03:22,428
He was different .

966
02:03:23,635 --> 02:03:26,331
He was chosen by the gods .

967
02:03:26,438 --> 02:03:28,269
He thought He was.

968
02:03:30,609 --> 02:03:33,134
He'd be forgotten
in a week.

969
02:03:46,424 --> 02:03:48,820
Hey , carry Him up there !

970
02:03:52,364 --> 02:03:54,730
Ready !
Come on !

971
02:04:05,343 --> 02:04:06,833
Wait !

972
02:05:14,212 --> 02:05:16,112
My son ...

973
02:05:20,819 --> 02:05:22,648
King of the Jews !

974
02:05:23,054 --> 02:05:25,387
Do you see this
Temple from there ?

975
02:05:26,257 --> 02:05:27,921
Leave Him !

976
02:05:30,961 --> 02:05:32,325
Father !

977
02:05:33,098 --> 02:05:34,565
Father !

978
02:05:37,535 --> 02:05:40,025
Forgive them , ...

979
02:05:41,973 --> 02:05:45,435
for they know not
what they do .

980
02:06:12,304 --> 02:06:13,694
You go first .

981
02:06:15,774 --> 02:06:16,864
Shit .

982
02:06:25,016 --> 02:06:27,407
Arent you the Messiah?

983
02:06:27,619 --> 02:06:30,884
Why dont You save Yourself
and us?

984
02:06:32,457 --> 02:06:35,893
Our punishment is just

985
02:06:35,994 --> 02:06:38,462
but this Man,

986
02:06:38,530 --> 02:06:41,124
has done nothing wrong.

987
02:06:42,868 --> 02:06:46,931
Remember me when
You come into Your kingdom.

988
02:06:48,073 --> 02:06:50,637
Truly I say to you , ...

989
02:06:51,443 --> 02:06:53,204
Today

990
02:06:54,713 --> 02:06:59,247
you will be
with me in paradise .

991
02:07:14,666 --> 02:07:16,327
Mother , ...

992
02:07:17,869 --> 02:07:19,959
This is your son ... !

993
02:07:23,174 --> 02:07:25,335
John , ...

994
02:07:26,344 --> 02:07:28,905
This is your mother ... !

995
02:07:34,352 --> 02:07:35,842
My God , ...

996
02:07:39,291 --> 02:07:41,320
My God , ...

997
02:07:43,428 --> 02:07:46,719
Why have you forsaken me ?

998
02:07:56,708 --> 02:07:58,598
I thirst .

999
02:10:04,502 --> 02:10:06,934
It's finished .

1000
02:11:00,291 --> 02:11:02,158
Father , ...

1001
02:11:04,829 --> 02:11:07,397
... into Your hands ...

1002
02:11:09,567 --> 02:11:12,499
... I commend my spirit .

1003
02:11:32,457 --> 02:11:34,785
Claudia ! /
Jesus is a noble man!

1004
02:13:41,586 --> 02:13:43,350
Take the body away !

1005
02:13:43,921 --> 02:13:45,254
Wait !

1006
02:13:45,723 --> 02:13:48,191
I have an order
from Pontius Pilate .

1007
02:13:52,797 --> 02:13:54,993
This body is ours.

1008
02:13:55,767 --> 02:13:57,501
Give it to them !

1009
02:15:12,302 --> 02:15:15,402
3 DAYS LATER

1010
02:15:31,529 --> 02:15:33,124
Where were you?

1011
02:15:33,697 --> 02:15:36,325
You were suppose
to be His rock .

1012
02:15:38,436 --> 02:15:40,370
I 've failed Him .

1013
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:48,401
Now I can not ask Him
to forgive me .

1014
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:08,765
Come back if you need anything .

1015
02:16:09,266 --> 02:16:10,556
I will.

1016
02:16:12,703 --> 02:16:15,497
Have a safe journey
back to Galilee .

1017
02:16:24,382 --> 02:16:25,872
Bless you .

1018
02:17:59,277 --> 02:18:01,268
Who are you looking for?

1019
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:04,945
If you'd taken Him ,
tell me where He is.

1020
02:18:06,350 --> 02:18:07,908
Mary ...

1021
02:18:16,661 --> 02:18:18,151
Teacher?

1022
02:18:19,664 --> 02:18:21,964
Go and tell
our brothers ...

1023
02:18:22,166 --> 02:18:24,027
I'm here .

1024
02:18:58,376 --> 02:19:01,368
Peter ! Peter !

1025
02:19:03,248 --> 02:19:06,376
Everyone!
The tomb is open .

1026
02:19:06,684 --> 02:19:08,475
He's alive !
What ?

1027
02:19:08,586 --> 02:19:09,951
I saw Him .

1028
02:19:10,254 --> 02:19:11,778
This is not possible .

1029
02:19:12,924 --> 02:19:14,883
No, I saw Him .

1030
02:19:14,993 --> 02:19:16,954
Mary, maybe it was someone
else

1031
02:19:18,429 --> 02:19:20,361
You think I'm mad ?

1032
02:19:23,601 --> 02:19:27,059
Peter, see the tomb
yourself .

1033
02:19:28,806 --> 02:19:30,005
Please.

1034
02:19:49,627 --> 02:19:50,855
Peter ?

1035
02:20:08,746 --> 02:20:10,776
Now do you believe me ?

1036
02:20:20,358 --> 02:20:22,249
But He's gone .

1037
02:20:23,294 --> 02:20:24,784
Gone?

1038
02:20:26,464 --> 02:20:27,658
No.

1039
02:20:31,336 --> 02:20:33,033
He's back .

1040
02:20:40,645 --> 02:20:43,236
Yes , it is still fresh .
Fresh bread .

1041
02:20:43,448 --> 02:20:44,938
Thank you .

1042
02:20:49,354 --> 02:20:52,216
A cup . I need
a cup and some wine .

1043
02:20:53,558 --> 02:20:54,785
What happened ?

1044
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:57,194
His body .

1045
02:21:03,568 --> 02:21:04,860
His blood .

1046
02:21:12,610 --> 02:21:14,402
" I am the way , ... "

1047
02:21:16,714 --> 02:21:19,012
" ...the Truth ... "

1048
02:21:20,518 --> 02:21:22,349
" ... and the Life . ''

1049
02:21:35,433 --> 02:21:36,764
No.

1050
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:41,133
No, this isnt real .

1051
02:21:57,288 --> 02:21:58,619
God .

1052
02:22:00,725 --> 02:22:02,590
Thomas ...

1053
02:22:04,429 --> 02:22:05,823
stop doubting...

1054
02:22:28,586 --> 02:22:31,150
And believe..

1055
02:22:34,826 --> 02:22:36,853
It is you .

1056
02:22:37,028 --> 02:22:39,087
Because you see Me , ...

1057
02:22:39,163 --> 02:22:41,324
...you believe .

1058
02:22:47,638 --> 02:22:49,697
Blessed are those ...

1059
02:22:50,441 --> 02:22:52,966
... who have not seen Me ...

1060
02:22:53,244 --> 02:22:57,046
and yet  have believed..

1061
02:23:02,547 --> 02:23:03,847
40 DAYS LATER

1062
02:23:10,604 --> 02:23:13,334
I do not know why
they run from me .

1063
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:18,034
They should be grateful in
saving them from God's judgment .

1064
02:23:18,145 --> 02:23:20,909
They even care about God?
No .

1065
02:23:21,381 --> 02:23:26,942
They abandoned God for
this dirty, uneducated scum.

1066
02:23:27,054 --> 02:23:28,385
Come on !

1067
02:23:48,075 --> 02:23:49,834
Who are you ?

1068
02:23:50,844 --> 02:23:52,937
Tell me who you are ?

1069
02:23:57,951 --> 02:23:59,780
I am Jesus , ...

1070
02:24:01,955 --> 02:24:04,321
whom you persecute.

1071
02:24:07,394 --> 02:24:08,425
No!

1072
02:24:10,597 --> 02:24:12,087
No!

1073
02:24:17,938 --> 02:24:20,466
Jesus is dead !

1074
02:24:22,543 --> 02:24:25,205
No! No!

1075
02:24:43,297 --> 02:24:46,464
My eyes gone blind .

1076
02:25:33,614 --> 02:25:35,081
Lord?

1077
02:25:37,584 --> 02:25:39,284
Ananias .

1078
02:25:41,722 --> 02:25:44,685
Go to the street
called Straight.

1079
02:25:45,793 --> 02:25:47,856
Ask for a man
they called ...

1080
02:25:48,896 --> 02:25:51,057
... Paul of Tarsus .

1081
02:25:51,932 --> 02:25:53,597
Paul ?

1082
02:25:53,901 --> 02:25:56,028
But he beats us .

1083
02:25:57,271 --> 02:25:59,705
He arrestes your followers
everywhere .

1084
02:26:05,145 --> 02:26:09,104
I have chosen him to proclaim
my name to the world , ...

1085
02:26:09,216 --> 02:26:11,081
... to the Gentiles , ...

1086
02:26:12,052 --> 02:26:14,143
their kings ... ...

1087
02:26:14,621 --> 02:26:17,055
... and the sons of Israel .

1088
02:26:19,526 --> 02:26:21,387
Go .

1089
02:27:14,648 --> 02:27:16,138
Who's there?

1090
02:27:32,833 --> 02:27:34,223
Who are you ?

1091
02:27:37,204 --> 02:27:38,838
Speak.

1092
02:27:38,906 --> 02:27:41,136
I'm one of those
you want to destroy.

1093
02:27:52,018 --> 02:27:54,150
Forgive me.

1094
02:28:00,827 --> 02:28:02,921
I have wronged you.

1095
02:28:04,264 --> 02:28:06,359
I have wronged God.

1096
02:28:08,335 --> 02:28:11,168
My soul is on fire.

1097
02:28:15,609 --> 02:28:17,543
Help me .

1098
02:28:21,682 --> 02:28:25,345
<i> I have chosen him to proclaim
my name to the world . </i>

1099
02:28:28,889 --> 02:28:30,079
Shh ...

1100
02:28:30,457 --> 02:28:32,154
Shh ...

1101
02:28:32,359 --> 02:28:34,350
Im sent by God .

1102
02:28:35,395 --> 02:28:37,260
For you .

1103
02:28:55,716 --> 02:28:57,547
I know you .

1104
02:28:57,818 --> 02:28:59,586
You came to my house .

1105
02:29:08,662 --> 02:29:09,729
No!

1106
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:11,789
No! No!
Dont leave me !

1107
02:29:11,898 --> 02:29:13,889
No! Dont leave me!

1108
02:29:15,902 --> 02:29:17,665
Shh ...

1109
02:29:24,211 --> 02:29:26,345
I , Ananias , ...

1110
02:29:26,613 --> 02:29:30,506
baptize you ... , Paul ,
in the name of Jesus Christ , ...

1111
02:29:33,253 --> 02:29:37,246
for He has chosen ... to
change the world in His name .

1112
02:29:47,668 --> 02:29:50,193
In the name of Jesus Christ .

1113
02:30:01,194 --> 02:30:04,594
JERUSALEM

1114
02:30:04,685 --> 02:30:08,050
They say that Paul of Tarsus has
recovered from his blindness,

1115
02:30:08,155 --> 02:30:11,584
and join the
Galileans.

1116
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,961
I 'll find him for you .

1117
02:30:24,571 --> 02:30:26,261
and then ?

1118
02:30:27,474 --> 02:30:30,535
Will I have to send someone
after you?

1119
02:30:32,546 --> 02:30:33,911
No.

1120
02:30:34,881 --> 02:30:36,476
Let them go .

1121
02:30:36,583 --> 02:30:41,916
as Gamaliel said ,
if this is man's work

1122
02:30:42,022 --> 02:30:44,213
... it will not succeed.

1123
02:30:46,326 --> 02:30:49,159
But if it's Gods...

1124
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:52,355
... we can not fight it .

1125
02:31:17,309 --> 02:31:19,436
<i>Driven from  Jerusalem , ... </i>

1126
02:31:19,544 --> 02:31:21,935
<i> ...the disciples become
missionaries.</i>

1127
02:31:22,114 --> 02:31:23,609
<i> Apostles . </i>

1128
02:31:23,815 --> 02:31:28,215
<i> Spreading the seeds of the new
faith, far and wide.</i>

1129
02:32:02,794 --> 02:32:04,221
Peter ...

1130
02:32:05,631 --> 02:32:07,790
... you have done so much .

1131
02:32:11,570 --> 02:32:14,370
I'm proud of you,
my fisher of men .

1132
02:32:14,572 --> 02:32:16,003
My Lord.

1133
02:32:16,174 --> 02:32:18,499
I 've done what
You told me.

1134
02:32:18,610 --> 02:32:21,238
We preach your words
throughout Judea .

1135
02:32:22,347 --> 02:32:25,578
That is just the beginning .

1136
02:32:26,151 --> 02:32:28,415
There are many across
the world ...

1137
02:32:28,887 --> 02:32:30,978
... who will want to hear you .

1138
02:32:31,089 --> 02:32:32,784
Without You, ...

1139
02:32:32,924 --> 02:32:35,017
it's just ... -

1140
02:32:39,765 --> 02:32:42,226
Open up,
in the name of Rome !

1141
02:32:44,002 --> 02:32:45,401
Answer it.

1142
02:32:51,176 --> 02:32:53,103
Remember , ...

1143
02:32:57,716 --> 02:33:01,149
... the door is open for everyone .

1144
02:33:14,933 --> 02:33:16,460
You must come with us .

1145
02:33:16,535 --> 02:33:19,231
Centurion Cornelius
wants you.

1146
02:33:35,887 --> 02:33:39,979
<i> Remember , the door is open
to everyone . </i>

1147
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:36,606
The angel came to me , ...

1148
02:34:36,715 --> 02:34:39,275
and told me ...
to find you ...

1149
02:34:39,384 --> 02:34:41,750
to listen to all
you have to say .

1150
02:34:43,288 --> 02:34:46,314
Please, save me .

1151
02:34:48,927 --> 02:34:51,490
I'm just a man like you .

1152
02:34:52,264 --> 02:34:54,623
It's Jesus who
can save you .

1153
02:34:58,503 --> 02:35:00,228
Come.

1154
02:35:08,079 --> 02:35:10,775
I , Peter , ...

1155
02:35:11,049 --> 02:35:13,743

<i> Cornelius is the first Roman ...</i>

You are the Son of God .

1217
02:41:20,952 --> 02:41:22,819
What if He's not The One?

1218

We're risking our lives,
for what ?

We do not know where You're going ,
how come we know the way?

1225
02:41:50,882 --> 02:41:53,150
I am the Way ...
