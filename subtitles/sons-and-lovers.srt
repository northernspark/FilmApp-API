is booked for the year.

portend such an incredible confidence...

of Ben Laden's talent...

of that slot thing.

619
00:34:46,737 --> 00:34:48,537
- Well done, Mr. D.
- Yeah, thanks.

620
00:34:48,637 --> 00:34:50,637
It was a rough mission.

621
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:53,637
Now I got this other thing
I gotta take care of.

622
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:56,337
Jillian's picking me up in an hour.

623
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:12,537
Our plane is taking some people back
to Los Angeles.

624
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:14,337
Should be back in a few hours.

625
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:17,237
We should be able to get you out of here
around midnight.

626
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:19,537
I don't want to run into my dad. Is he gone?

627
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:21,137
I'm not sure.

628
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:25,937
I just want you to know that all of this...

629
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:28,337
the setup, the surprise,
all of this was my idea.

630
00:35:28,437 --> 00:35:31,237
So don't blame your dad.
He had nothing to do with this.

631
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,237
We convinced him of it.

632
00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:36,037
I met your dad because
he returned a stolen wallet...

633
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:38,337
along with $10,000 in cash.

634
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:41,537
So he's honest.

635
00:35:41,837 --> 00:35:44,337
Tell him to join the Boy Scouts.

636
00:35:46,737 --> 00:35:50,537
Your dad's homeless. You know that?
He lives on the street.

637
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:55,537
He's made mistakes. He knows that.
He's devastated by it.

638
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,137
But I'm telling you, he really is sorry...

639
00:35:58,237 --> 00:36:00,837
and he still loves his son.

640
00:36:01,137 --> 00:36:02,237
[Kevin sighs]

641
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:04,937
They say Vegas is a city
of second chances, right?

642
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,537
That's all he wants.

643
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:08,337
Just talk to him.

644
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,237
JILLIAN: Ready, honey?

645
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,737
Wait a minute.
I gotta talk to you for a minute.

646
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:21,837
- Now?
- Yeah.

647
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:24,237
The concert starts in 15 minutes.

648
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:36,937
What do you got going on
with this Mark McGrath?

649
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:40,137
- Nothing.
- You were at his apartment yesterday.

650
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:43,037
- You had me followed?
- No. You were seen there.

651
00:36:43,137 --> 00:36:45,937
And I don't remember
you telling me anything about it.

652
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,937
There's nothing going on
between Mark and me.

653
00:36:49,037 --> 00:36:51,637
I went to his apartment because...

654
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:55,037
Can we talk about this tonight at dinner?

655
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:58,337
- I promise you I will tell you everything.
- Yeah.

656
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:00,937
JILLIAN: You know me better than that.

657
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:05,137
I can't believe we're having
this conversation on our 30th anniversary.

658
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:10,837
- Did you plan out the evening like I asked?
- I planned it.

659
00:37:11,137 --> 00:37:12,637
You didn't ask.

660
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:16,037
The Sugar Ray concert
and dinner at Mystique.

661
00:37:16,237 --> 00:37:18,537
So, now I gotta listen to this guy sing?

662
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:21,637
ROSE: Quarters. Both these are quarters.

663
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:24,637
ROSE: Quarters. There you go. Good luck.
Break the bank.

664
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:25,937
MARY: Rose?
MAN: Thanks a lot.

665
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:28,237
ROSE: Hey.
MARY: You work here now?

666
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:30,837
Yeah, well. Actually, I applied a while ago.

667
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:32,837
They just happened to call me yesterday.

668
00:37:32,937 --> 00:37:35,437
Coincidentally, right after
Ben Laden fired me, so...

669
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:38,037
You just need a client with some talent.

670
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:39,837
ROSE: What are you gonna do?

671
00:37:39,937 --> 00:37:41,837
ROSE: There you go.
MARY: Cosme!

672
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,937
Cosme, did you say
you were looking for an agent?

673
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:51,437
- Yes, that is correct.
- Yeah? Okay.

674
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,237
MARY: Rose Gluck?

675
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,137
- I'd like you to meet Cosme.
- Cosme!

676
00:37:56,237 --> 00:37:58,337
ROSE: Just the one name. That's fantastic.

677
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:02,437
I saw you the other night.
You are an incredibly talented young man.

678
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:04,837
Rose Gluck, Gluck Talent Management.

All the songs that she used to sing

685

MARK: Thank you very much!
You're too kind.

691
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:37,237
We have a special request right now
from a beautiful lady...

692
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:41,837
to the man that she loves
on the occasion of their 30th anniversary.

so be on your best behaviour.

It's their 30th anniversary.
Come on! Let me hear you!

701
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:06,737
I've been dealing with Jillian all week here...

702
00:39:06,837 --> 00:39:10,337
and she kept telling me how much
she loves you more and more each day.

703
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:12,537
I think that's pretty special after 30 years.

704
00:39:12,637 --> 00:39:14,737
So one more time,
please give it up for them.
