A coast watch?

Yes, sir.
One of our men
with a radio...

316
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,645
hiding out on one
of the enemy-held islands...

317
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,898
where he could watch
for enemy ships...

through the bottleneck
down this way.

What do you think,

320
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,699
Well, sir, our pilots
could do a lot of damage...

321
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,244
to enemy convoys with
information like that.

How would you get a man
on one of those islands?

somehow, sir.

spotted him?

326
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,757
It could be done, sir.

going to do it?

Now, before you give us
an answer,

838
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:44,411
I wanna impress you
with three things.

839
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:48,582
First— you are a civilian
and you don't have to go.

840
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,419
Second— this is
a very dangerous mission...

841
01:08:52,504 --> 01:08:55,172
and there's no guarantee
that you will survive...

842
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:58,383
or that it will do
any good.

843
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,725
Third— that it might
do a great good.

844
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,229
It might be the means
of turning the tide
of the war in this area.

845
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,565
Yeah, I understand
all these things.

846
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,193
Are you ready to give us
your answer?

847
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,278
Yes, I am.

848
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:21,949
My answer must be no.

849
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,334
When a man faces death,

850
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,087
he must weigh values
very carefully.

851
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:40,050
He must weigh
the sweetness of his life...

852
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:43,387
against the thing
he's asked to die for.

853
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,226

is very great...

854

to do is— is that—

862
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,307
When I was 22,

863
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:32,895
I thought the world
hated bullies
as much as I did.

864
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,939
I was foolish,
and I killed one.

865
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,028
I was forced to flee
to an island.

866
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:46,491
Since then, I have asked
no help from anyone...

867
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,369
or any country.

868
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:53,498

I want you to know
I have no apologies.

02:19:22,521 --> 02:19:24,981
Choiseul,
New Georgia.

1692
02:19:25,065 --> 02:19:28,693
We expect rain
in this region
from 9:00 to 2:00.

[Cable]
0900 to 1400.

1694
02:19:31,071 --> 02:19:33,448
Oh, my friend Joe
corrects me.

1695
02:19:33,532 --> 02:19:36,367
0900 to 1400.

1696
02:19:38,203 --> 02:19:41,664
You must not expect from us
any regular communication.

1697
02:19:41,749 --> 02:19:44,876
There are hundreds
of Japanese
in this region.

1698
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:47,920
It will be necessary
to constantly change
our quarters.

1699
02:19:48,005 --> 02:19:50,506
And now, our
military expert Joe.

1700
02:19:50,591 --> 02:19:54,052
[Cable]
All you navy, marine
and army pilots,

1701
02:19:54,136 --> 02:19:56,888
write this down.

1702
02:19:56,972 --> 02:20:00,683
Surface craft—
19 troop barges...

1703
02:20:00,768 --> 02:20:04,562
headed down
the bottleneck,
speed about 11 knots.

1704
02:20:04,646 --> 02:20:07,607
Ought to pass Banika...

1705
02:20:07,691 --> 02:20:10,610
at about 2000 tonight,

1706
02:20:10,694 --> 02:20:12,737
escorted by
heavy warships.

1707
02:20:12,821 --> 02:20:14,739
As for aircraft,

1708
02:20:14,823 --> 02:20:16,783
22 bombers, Betties—

1709
02:20:16,909 --> 02:20:20,870
A bottle of beer says
I get the first strike!
went by at 0600,

1710
02:20:20,954 --> 02:20:24,165
[Cheering]
headed south southwest.

1711
02:20:24,291 --> 02:20:27,126
About time!
[Cable] There ought to be some
way to knock off a few of those.

1712
02:20:27,211 --> 02:20:30,922
- Hey, wait for us!
- That's all for now.
Good luck.

1713
02:20:57,157 --> 02:21:01,577
Two weeks?
Well, how can those guys
stick it out for two weeks?

1714
02:21:01,662 --> 02:21:05,998
Yeah. Everybody thought
they'd be dead pigeons
in a couple of days.

1715
02:21:07,918 --> 02:21:10,753
I tell you,
those two guys are doing us
a lot of good.

1716
02:21:10,838 --> 02:21:13,631
That Frenchman
reported 40 bombers
north of Munda.

1717
02:21:13,715 --> 02:21:16,717
We took off,
and 40 bombers right
on the nose— boom, boom.

1718
02:21:16,802 --> 02:21:19,637
How do those guys
keep alive up there?
The enemy's all around.

1719
02:21:19,721 --> 02:21:21,639
How do they do it?

1720
02:21:21,723 --> 02:21:24,934
That Frenchman knows
these jungles around here
like the palm of his hand.

1721
02:21:25,060 --> 02:21:28,312
He's a hunter, see?
All I know is, they changed
the whole setup here.

1722
02:21:28,397 --> 02:21:30,898
I think
we got the Japanese
on the run.

1723
02:21:30,983 --> 02:21:33,317
That's what
the Frenchman said.

1724
02:21:33,402 --> 02:21:36,195
Well, is it my lead?
Yeah.

1725
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:39,407
Let me see.
Come on, come on.
I got money on this.

1726
02:21:39,575 --> 02:21:43,536
[Emile]
Listen carefully, please.
Ceiling today unlimited.

1727
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:45,872
Thirty-three fighters,
Zeros,

1728
02:21:45,956 --> 02:21:47,999
have moved in
from Bougainville.

1729
02:21:48,083 --> 02:21:52,628
Their course
is approximately
0-2-3 degrees true.

1730
02:21:52,713 --> 02:21:55,047
[Engines Droning]

1731
02:21:55,132 --> 02:21:57,967
I'm certain
heavy bombers
will follow.

1732
02:21:58,051 --> 02:22:00,887
I think something big
is afoot.

1733
02:22:02,306 --> 02:22:04,223
That's all
I have time for now.

1734
02:22:04,308 --> 02:22:06,809
Joe and I must change
our position immediately.

1735
02:22:06,894 --> 02:22:08,853
Planes are
directly overhead.

1736
02:22:08,937 --> 02:22:12,190
Two only, but they're
looking for us, I think.

1737
02:22:12,274 --> 02:22:14,066
They know about
where we are.

1738
02:22:14,151 --> 02:22:17,028
I will try to
get back to you later.
Good luck.

1739
02:22:17,112 --> 02:22:20,615
They got us
pretty well pinpointed.
Stay here.

1740
02:22:20,699 --> 02:22:24,035
In a few minutes,
it will be dark enough
to run for it.

1741
02:22:25,787 --> 02:22:28,122
You know, I think
we're right.

1742
02:22:28,207 --> 02:22:32,168
It looks like
they're going all out.
Even these planes.

1743
02:22:32,252 --> 02:22:34,712
They've stopped
looking for us.
They're going away.

1744
02:22:34,796 --> 02:22:37,298
Let's make
a run for it.

1745
02:22:39,009 --> 02:22:41,010
All right. Let's go.

1746
02:22:42,471 --> 02:22:45,473
[Machine Gun Fire]

1747
02:22:47,351 --> 02:22:50,353
A-And we have
a lot of fighter pilots
over in the ward,

1748
02:22:50,437 --> 02:22:54,065
and— and they keep talking
about a Frenchman.

1749
02:22:54,149 --> 02:22:57,902
The Frenchman said this, and
the Frenchman said that, and—

1750
02:22:57,986 --> 02:23:01,989
I was just wondering
if the Frenchman they're
talking about could be...

1751
02:23:03,867 --> 02:23:05,826
my Frenchman.

1752
02:23:07,162 --> 02:23:09,455
Yes, Miss Forbush,
it is.

1753
02:23:09,539 --> 02:23:11,540
I couldn't tell you
before, but—

1754
02:23:11,625 --> 02:23:14,835
Then he is
behind enemy lines.

1755
02:23:14,920 --> 02:23:17,713
With Lieutenant Cable.

1756
02:23:21,927 --> 02:23:25,972
Hello. This is Emile De Becque.
Please listen to me carefully.

1757
02:23:26,056 --> 02:23:29,517
I haven't much time.

1758
02:23:29,601 --> 02:23:33,604
My message today
must be brief and sad.

1759
02:23:36,275 --> 02:23:38,901

02:23:38,986 --> 02:23:40,945

I will never know
a finer man.

1763
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:51,956
I wish he could have
told you the news.

1764
02:23:52,040 --> 02:23:54,417
The Japanese
are pulling out.

1765
02:23:54,501 --> 02:23:57,461
There is
great confusion here.

1766
02:23:57,546 --> 02:24:01,924
My guess is that the enemy
will try to evacuate troops
from Cape Esperance tonight.

1767
02:24:02,009 --> 02:24:04,302
This is the opportunity
we've been waiting for.

1768
02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:07,263
Make the most of it,
my friends.

1769

You may not hear from me again.
They are coming back.

Poor Joe Cable.

1777
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:35,249
Captain Brackett, do you think
there's a chance I'll ever see
Emile De Becque again?

1778
02:24:35,334 --> 02:24:37,293
There's a chance.
Of course there's a chance.

1779
02:24:37,419 --> 02:24:39,837
I didn't even know
he was going.
Of course not.

1780

How could he tell you?
Don't blame Emile De Becque.
He's okay.

02:24:43,050 --> 02:24:45,801
He's a wonderful guy.
Uh-huh.

He has got a chance,
hasn't he, Bill?

1783
02:24:48,096 --> 02:24:51,349
Of course.
There's always a chance.

Emile, come back
so I can tell you something.

What a pinhead I was!

1792

Come back so I can tell you.
Oh, don't die before
I can tell you.

All that matters
is us being together.

in three rubber boats...

1840
02:28:54,509 --> 02:28:56,510
on three different sides
of the island.

1841
02:28:56,595 --> 02:28:59,388
Confuse them
out of their minds!

1842
02:28:59,472 --> 02:29:01,515
Get the picture?

1843
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,101
That's very fine, Billis,
but you're too late.

1844
02:29:04,185 --> 02:29:06,145
Operation Alligator
is under way.

1845
02:29:06,229 --> 02:29:09,982
Landings were made on a bunch of
Japanese-held islands during the
night and early this morning.

1846
02:29:10,066 --> 02:29:12,276
Mary Louise Island
was the first one they hit.

1847
02:29:12,360 --> 02:29:15,112
How about
that Frenchman?
Did they get him?

1848
02:29:15,196 --> 02:29:17,448
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

1849
02:29:17,532 --> 02:29:20,367
Lieutenant Buzz Adams
flew up there to find out.

1850
02:29:20,452 --> 02:29:23,954
But it would be just too bad
if a part of this huge operation
couldn't have saved...

1851
02:29:24,039 --> 02:29:27,249
one of the two guys
who made it all possible.

1852
02:29:33,715 --> 02:29:36,050
The big ones
are battleships.

1853
02:29:36,134 --> 02:29:39,136
And the little ones
are, uh, destroyers.

1854
02:29:39,220 --> 02:29:41,680
They're moving out,
you see, because—

1855
02:29:41,765 --> 02:29:44,433
well, there's been
a big change.

1856
02:29:44,517 --> 02:29:46,894
They won't be around
here much anymore.

1857
02:29:46,978 --> 02:29:49,730
Just off and on,
a few of us.

1858
02:29:51,733 --> 02:29:54,652
Did you understand
anything I said?

1859
02:29:54,736 --> 02:29:57,821
[Sighs]
Vous ne comprenez pas?

1860
02:29:57,906 --> 02:29:59,823
Oui, oui.
Nous comprenons.

1861
02:29:59,908 --> 02:30:01,825
Oui.

1862
02:30:01,910 --> 02:30:04,286
Now, while I'm down
at the hospital,

1863
02:30:04,371 --> 02:30:07,581
you've got to promise me
to mangez everything—

1864
02:30:07,666 --> 02:30:10,584
everything that's put
before you on the table.

1865
02:30:10,669 --> 02:30:13,629
Sur la table.

1866
02:30:13,713 --> 02:30:16,131
Sur "le" table?

1867
02:30:16,216 --> 02:30:18,175
Sur la table.

1868
02:30:18,259 --> 02:30:21,053
Oh. Sur la table.

1869
02:30:21,137 --> 02:30:23,097
Merci.

1870
02:30:23,181 --> 02:30:26,183
Jerome! Come back here
and sit down.

1871
02:30:41,783 --> 02:30:44,076
Asseyez-vous!

1872
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:48,831
Now, you have to learn to
mind me when I talk to you
and be nice to me too...

1873
02:30:51,292 --> 02:30:54,002
because I love you
very much.

1874
02:30:55,463 --> 02:30:57,423
Je t'aime.
[Chuckles]

1875
02:30:57,507 --> 02:31:00,008
Je vous aime.

1876
02:31:00,093 --> 02:31:02,010
Now, mangez.

1877
02:31:05,515 --> 02:31:09,351
Chantez, Nellie.
Mmm. I will not
sing that song.

1878
02:31:09,436 --> 02:31:11,770
You just want to laugh
at my French accent.

1879
02:31:17,777 --> 02:31:21,029
All right.
But you gotta help me.
