00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,403
The battle between Heaven
and Hell has waged eternal,

3
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:33,782
their armies fueled
by souls harvested on Earth.

4
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,202
The devil, Malebolgia, has sent
a lieutenant to Earth...

5
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,997
to recruit men to turn the
world into a place of death...

6
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:43,875
in exchange
for wealth and power...

7
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:47,712
a place that provides enough
souls to complete his army...

8
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:51,716
and allow Armageddon to begin.

9
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:56,096
All the Dark Lord needs now
is a great soldier,

10
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:59,474
someone who can lead his hordes
to the gates of Heaven...

11
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:03,103
and burn them down.

12
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,795
Like him,
I killed in the name of good,

13
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,672
but the violence of my life...

14
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:38,383
pulled my soul
towards the darkness.

15
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:42,929
But I fought and freed my soul.

16
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:47,517
Now I watch for others like me.

17
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:50,729
Men are the ones
who create evil on Earth.

18
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,606
It is
the choices they make...

19
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:55,775
that enslave their souls
to Hell.

20
00:03:55,984 --> 00:04:00,322
This is the test.

21
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,507
The leader of the Algerian
Revolutionary Front...

22
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:26,968
was killed yesterday along
with 26 innocent civilians...

23
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,679
in a vicious rocket attack
in Hong Kong.

24
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:32,807
There has been an outpouring
of anti-U.S. Sentiment...

25
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,184
sweeping across the globe.

26
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:37,020
Protesters in Libya, Bosnia,
France, Moscow...

27
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,021
and the United States...

28
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,565
are denouncing...

29
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:42,484
Simmons is the best.

30
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:44,319
Simmons is not the problem!

31
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,821
He's overseas
killing the bad guys...

32
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,616
like the hero he thinks he is.

33
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:50,825
We made a deal, Wynn.

34
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,035
Where the hell...

35
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,995
is the ultimate weapon
you promised?

36
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:56,414
This isn't a game we're playing.

37
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:59,417
Engineering a biological weapon
is an exact science.

38
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:02,128
You want it done right,
you do it my way.

39
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:05,340
This five-year plan of yours
just chaps my buttocks.

40
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,759
I'm making you a guarantee.

41
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:10,470
Just keep certain agencies
off my back...

42
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,431
and make damn sure I get
all that I've been promised.

43
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,977
If I say you're the man,
you're the man.

44
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:20,272
You do for me, in no time
you'll be running this place.

45
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,733
When the big piòata breaks,
you'll get it all.

46
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:28,154
Just make sure you keep
your end of the bargain.

47
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,906
P.S.

48
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,450
There's one more item
on our "to do" list.

49
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:35,287
It requires
your personal attention.

50
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:38,290
We need you to help recruit
a very special soldier for us.

51
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:42,002
Your all-time favorite killer,
Al Simmons.

52
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,422
Simmons? He's doing a great job
where he is.

53
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,965
Why do you want him?

54
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,467
Why do you people
always question?

55
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:54,973
Why ask "Why?"
When "How?" is so much more fun?

56
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:07,777
Oh... not again.

57
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:10,572
- Wanda, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

58
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,948
Buy your man a watch.

59
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,992
He's on his way out.
Do me a favor.

60
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:15,160
What's that?

61
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,120
Make sure he's back
for dinner tomorrow night.

62
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,246
I'll do my best.

63
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:20,457
Make sure he's back
for dinner, Terry.

64
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,084
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,347
Hey, Spaz.

66
00:08:35,555 --> 00:08:37,474
Same routine, all right?

67
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:40,560
Guard the house. Guard Wanda.

68
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:43,522
Great guard dog.

69
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:52,155
Here.

70
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:57,285
Al, what happened last night?
Look at this.

71
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,037
What a friggin' mess.

72
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,872
We were supposed
to take out bad guys,

73
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:02,332
not innocent bystanders.

74
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,417
Another Jason Wynn special.

75
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,127
What do you mean?

76
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:10,382
An awful lot of Wynn's ops
have screwed the pooch lately.

77
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,636
Don't worry, Al. Lighten up.
I got your back.

78
00:09:15,303 --> 00:09:18,723
Semper fi.
Good to go.

79
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:22,102
All right.

80
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:38,743
I'm going to
keep my eye on Wynn.

81
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:45,417
Vehicle secure.

82
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,384
The airport kill zone...

83
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,845
was supposed to be clear
of civilians.

84
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:59,890
An unfortunate
but necessary sacrifice.

85
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:03,727
You want someone
filling body bags, send Priest.

86
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:07,564
If you can't handle it,
I will.

87
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:12,194
I will send whoever
wherever I choose.

88
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:14,738
You will follow orders
and do your job.

89
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,281
Got a problem
with that, soldier?

90
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:22,204
Yes, I do, sir...
and I want out.

91
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:25,540
I always knew
you'd lose your nerve.

92
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,626
You don't quit us, son.

93
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:31,713
We are not
the U.S. Postal Service.

94
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:36,051
Have you read
your profile recently?

95
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:37,969
You are a borderline psychopath,

96
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,472
perfect for government service.

97
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,228
No guilt, no fear.
You're a killing machine.

98
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:49,773
- You're wrong about me, Wynn.
- Am I?

99
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:51,274
Have you
stopped to consider...

100
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,401
that you won't be happy
doing anything else?

101
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,237
I made up my mind.

102
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:57,572
Nothing I can say
to change it?

103
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,742
Nothing.

104
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:03,203
I'll arrange
for your transfer...

105
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:06,414
right after we've run
this last operation.

106
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,001
North Korean refinery secretly
producing biological weapons.

107
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,505
It's up to us
to take out the plant...

108
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:18,802
and carefully destroy
all the biochemical viruses.

109
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:23,306
Come on, son.
This is top priority.

110
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:29,229
Let's get it over with.

111
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:50,393
What the hell is going on here?

112
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:52,187
Priorities have changed, Al.

113
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:54,523
There's a town nearby.

114
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:57,526
If you release the virus,
they'll all die.

115
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:01,988
A town with approximately
8,000 experimental hosts.

116
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:04,074
Are you out of your damn mind?

117
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,410
I'm not going
to let you do this.

118
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,585
Looks like I'm up
for a promotion.

119
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,713
You wipe his ass, too?

120
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:23,260
You son of a bitch.

121
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,637
You knew what was
going on all along.

122
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:30,058
I do believe he's catching on.

123
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,817
Enjoy your retirement,
old friend.

124
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:42,779
Oh, and by the way,
don't worry about Wanda.

125
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,907
I'll take good care of her.

126
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:50,120
You touch her,
and you're a dead man.

127
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,623
You're the dead man.

128
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,925
See you in Hell, Al.

129
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,690
Aw, look who was left
in the oven too long.

130
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,859
I told him well-done,
not burnt.

131
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,155
I'm gonna have fun with you.

132
00:16:35,535 --> 00:16:38,580
Hey, mister,
you don't look so good.

133
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:41,666
Hey, mister, you thirsty?

134
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:49,716
Get the...
Get lost, kid.

135
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,972
What are you looking at,
old man?

136
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,476
You tell me.

137
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,854
You've been gone
a long time, friend.

138
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,648
What are you talking about?

139
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,024
Where am I?

140
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,859
Rat city.
Part of the alley.

141
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,529
I sleep over there.

142
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:14,324
This is a holy place.
All are welcome here.

143
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,327
Here, Zack, here.

144
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,163
Yeah, right.

145
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,539
Don't loiter!
Let's go! Let's go!

146
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:16,803
You're welcome to join us...
if you choose.

147
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:23,310
I got a home.

148
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,658
A new Hellspawn has emerged
from the darkness.

149
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,119
Reborn on Earth...

150
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,997
drawn to the alley
by an unknown force...

151
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,791
his necroplasmic body
wracked by pain...

152
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,919
his memories fragmented.

153
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:51,963
To him, North Korea
was moments ago.

154
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:56,760
Malebolgia kept him secluded
in darkness five long years...

155
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:59,763
while things on Earth
changed in ways...

156
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:03,975
that will only feed his anger
and desire for revenge.

157
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,729
He sets out
to reclaim his humanity.

158
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:12,901
How much is left
remains to be seen.

159
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,632
One...

160
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,092
two...

161
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,137
three!

162
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:52,524
I don't have a choice.

163
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:55,026
I'll always love you...

164
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,238
forever.

165
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,391
Spaz.

166
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,894
Kids, I got more tricks
than your local hooker.

167
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,103
Here you go.

168
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,148
They say it's a trick,
but it's snot.

169
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:36,359
Little girl,
where are you going?

170
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:42,699
Want some candy?

171
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,454
Cyan!

172
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:50,916
You OK, baby?
Terry!

173
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,211
I like children... fried.

174
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,841
What's going on?

175
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,593
This man
was lying next to Cyan.

176
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,678
Are you OK, honey?

177
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,640
What are you doing
back here, huh?

178
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,517
What is it?

179
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,435
Beat it
before I call the cops.

180
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,770
Come on, get out of here.

181
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:15,857
There you are. I've been
looking everywhere for you.

182
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,318
Bad Crispy! Bad Crispy!

183
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,278
Clown not like.

184
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,739
Sorry for the turbulence, folks.

185
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,032
He's harmless.

186
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,992
Just a freak accident
with some Jiffy Pop.

187
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,828
Just get out of here
and take him.

188
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,290
Oh, what an adorable
little girl.

189
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,917
Can I keep her?

190
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,001
Hey.

191
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,129
Of course not.
No pets allowed.

192
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,340
A little something
for Lolita here?

193
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,177
Baby exorcist.

194
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,555
Come on,
my barbecued friend.

195
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,056
Don't want to keep...

196
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,893
that side order
of potato salad waiting.

197
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,569
- He knew my name.
- Are you sure?

198
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,740
Come on.
Let's get the kids inside.

199
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,913
You can't get married.

200
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,666
Wanda's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

201
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,834
I'm there for you, buddy.

202
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,794
This is my last mission.

203
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,004
Wait for me.

204
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,589
I just don't
want to lose you, baby.

205
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:25,343
You will never lose me.
I promise.

206
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,891
The master and I
are going to have words.

207
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,351
He knows I hate clowns.
God, I hate them.

208
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,769
I hate them all.

209
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,521
I hate Bozo, Ronald, Chuckles...

210
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,319
with their freakin' dumb noses
and their lousy party hats!

211
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,822
I don't mind being
short, fat, and ugly,

212
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,658
but the pay sucks!

213
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,624
Easy with that face.
I'm eating.

214
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,751
What does this remind you of?

215
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,212
No, naughty boy.

216
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,588
Oops. A wet one.

217
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:05,509
I hope I didn't
stain my underwear.

218
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:09,012
Look at that.
Skid marks.

219
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,806
Get away from me, you freak.

220
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,726
Coming from a monster,
that really hurts my feelings.

221
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,020
Come back here, scrotum-face.

222
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,023
I'm not done with you yet.

223
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,401
Feels like my skin
is about to explode.

224
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,864
That's your viral necroplasm
going through its larval stage.

225
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,033
Move over.

226
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,868
Pretty soon
you'll get hair in funny places,

227
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,745
and you'll start
thinking about girls.

228
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,163
Getting a chubby, studly?

229
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,542
A half guy, semi?

230
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,211
Just get me to a hospital.

231
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,171
A hospital?

232
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,591
Have you looked in a mirror,
burnt man walking?

233
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,804
Even the entire cast of "ER"
couldn't put you together again.

234
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,138
How do I put this to you?

235
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,515
You're pushing up daisies.

236
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,600
You're in permanent nap time.

237
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,728
You're fertilizer.
Is any of this sinking in?

238
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,272
You're dead.

239
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,733
D-e-d. Dead.

240
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,694
I guess five years
feeding earthworms...

241
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:10,365
has eaten what little brain
there was in there.

242
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,744
What are you?

243
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,790
Allow me
to kick-start your memory.

244
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,210
Hang on. These flashbacks
can be killers.

245
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,213
You're the dead man.

246
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:29,384
See you in Hell, Al.

247
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,160
This is the bargain.

248
00:24:55,368 --> 00:25:02,083
If you lead my army,
you can see Wanda again.

249
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:08,131
What is your answer?

250
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,383
I will lead your army!

251
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,345
Anything for Wanda!

252
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:20,060
If you fail me, you will die.

253
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:27,025
Avenge your murder.
Kill Jason Wynn.

254
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,820
Malebolgia spent five years
preparing the Earth...

255
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,531
for your arrival, mister.

256
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,783
A little death,
a little destruction...

257
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,035
perfect marriage.

258
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,662
Speaking of marriage...

259
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,873
guess who's not
your fiancée anymore.

260
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,709
And the winners
are Wanda and Terry.

261
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,212
Multiplying like rabbits.

262
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,089
And humpin' and porkin'...

263
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,591
and doin' it and likin' it.

264
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,010
You stay away from her.

265
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,303
I don't want Wanda.

266
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,305
I want you
to take care of Wynn.

267
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:01,434
Then you and the army
can kick some angelic buttocks.

268
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,228
And in return
for your services,

269
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,480
we'll get Wanda back for you.

270
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,482
You could have
every Wanda on the planet.

271
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,069
Why settle for leftovers?

272
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,405
I love this guy.
You kill me.

273
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,533
Go ahead, stud.

274
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,578
This is all
some sadistic game of Wynn's.

275
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,830
And when I catch him...

276
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,749
he'll wish he had killed me
when he had the chance.

277
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,543
That's it!
That's the spirit.

278
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,879
Just think of me
as your guardian angel.

279
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,380
The clown from Hell.

280
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,757
You're Jimmy Stewart,
and I'm Clarence.

281
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,928
"Uh, well, well,
every time somebody farts,

282
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,264
a demon gets his wings."

283
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,016
Oops, twins.

284
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,436
Get away from me,
you fudge-packing midget!

285
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,897
You still don't get it,
do you, Amnesia Boy?

286
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,275
We'll have to dig
a little deeper.

287
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,948
What is this?

288
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:01,036
This is where old folks
go after Florida, son.

289
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,704
What is that you say?

290
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,623
Can I dig up my body now?

291
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,250
Why, certainly.
Of course you can.

292
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,671
If you strike oil,
half of it is mine.

293
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,591
Start digging.

294
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,011
Hail, Satan, lord of all
that we can see.

295
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,599
In the name of Luther,
Bialy, and Levinson,

296
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,145
I command thee to appear!

297
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,234
Told you we need
a bigger pentagram.

298
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:37,280
How about we get back to
that sacrifice-a-virgin idea?

299
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,990
I like that!

300
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,617
You know what I need here, man?

301
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,537
A fresh skull, man!

302
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,621
Yeah, you.

303
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,250
- Get away!
- Fresh!

304
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,999
Every time you go out there,

305
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,836
you come back
a little bit more dead inside.

306
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,468
Oh, come on.
You scream like a girl.

307
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,305
Do it like this.

308
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,810
Someone's a little angry
'cause they died and went to...

309
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,271
Hello, my mutant,
hello, my carcass,

310
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,191
hello, my bug-infested corpse.

311
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,985
Did, like, Satan send you guys?

312
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,237
God hogs up
all the good followers,

313
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,780
and we get all the retards.

314
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,407
What's up with that face?

315
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:06,286
Get your hands off me!

316
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,174
Help.

317
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,094
What is that?

318
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,985
Shocked and amazed
at the wonders of necroflesh?

319
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,695
You're not alone.

320
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,947
For a limited time only,

321
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,658
you, too, can have
this handsome epidermis...

322
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,870
for the eensy price of your soul
and a buttload of pain.

323
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,957
- Let's get out of here!
- Oh, my God!

324
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,292
I hate weekend Satanists,
don't you?

325
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,754
Look at you.

326
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:03,844
From spawn larva to full-fledged
Hellspawn in record time.

327
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,514
What... is this?

328
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,224
You were tied to the tracks,

329
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,519
and that stupid train just kept
running over you, didn't it?

330
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,146
Running over you.

331
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,275
In the name of the people
and things of Hell,

332
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,277
I dub thee...

333
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,905
Spawn, general of Hell's army.

334
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,782
Arise, Your Crispness!

335
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,910
Arise, Duke of Deep-Fried!

336
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,203
Sultan of Sizzling!

337
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,831
Emir of Ooey-Gooey!

338
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,959
So I suck as a clown.
Bite me.

339
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:40,463
Do your job, I'll be the first
to kiss your black butt,

340
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,174
but if you can't hack it,

341
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,384
I'll Fed Ex
your worthless carcass...

342
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:45,802
back to the frying pan,

343
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,639
where Malebolgia will be
waiting for us.

344
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,560
You'll wake up the dead.
That's you.

345
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,228
Dead people can still die.

346
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,608
All I got to do
is cut off your head.

347
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,860
Oh, God.

348
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,113
Did you have
to use the "G" word?

349
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:07,824
Wanda...

350
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,453
What have I done?

351
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,585
You done
with this Hallmark moment?

352
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:23,298
I can't take any more of this
sentimental crap. Come on.

353
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,384
I'll come back
when your armor hardens.

354
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,387
Don't play with it.
You'll go blind.

355
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,723
I have a few more details
to attend to,

356
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,352
and then we can play.

357
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,107
Yuck!

358
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,694
I hate anchovies.

359
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:59,376
That tastes so good,
I could kick some puppies!

360
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,267
This freak stuff
will come in handy...

361
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,228
when I get my hands on Wynn.

362
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,064
You're letting them get to you.

363
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,482
Easy, friend.

364
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,736
Every choice
has its consequences.

365
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,698
Who are you?

366
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,285
An assassin... like you.

367
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,622
I killed for the kingdom
of Saxony 500 years ago.

368
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,000
I am Cogliostro.

369
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,211
That's all you need to know...
for now.

370
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,131
Are there any normal people
left on Earth?

371
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:51,386
Or is everyone
just back from Hell?

372
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,133
How do you address
the accusations from some...

373
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,427
that the CIA
only acts to protect...

374
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,595
the government's
economic interests...

375
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,347
in the regions of conflict?

376
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,474
I think the government
has been attentive...

377
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,143
to the sensitivities
of the nations involved.

378
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,730
Since the unfortunate incident
in Southeast Asia last week,

379
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:46,525
Director Wynn has been meeting
with several world leaders...

380
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,360
in an attempt to quell
the proliferation...

381
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,528
of global conflicts.

382
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,238
Has this produced results?

383
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,241
Last week's peace summit
between Arabs and Israelis...

384
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,869
was disrupted by bomb threats
from the Christian Coalition.

385
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,871
Fitzgerald may be
a spineless bureaucrat,

386
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,582
but he's doing
a great P.R. Job for me.

387
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,835
The world is going
to Hell in a handbasket.

388
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,796
Thanks to him, it's just
another story on the 5:00 news.

389
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,799
Like lambs to the slaughter.

390
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,219
The best is yet to come.

391
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,224
There it is, Jess.

392
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,351
Finally ready.

393
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,270
HEAT-16.

394
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,023
Makes the Ebola virus
look like a skin rash.

395
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,026
That North Korean biochemical
operation really paid off.

396
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,072
We harvested the ultimate weapon
from those diseased bodies,

397
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,368
and now we have
the only vaccine.

398
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,079
- Was there ever any doubt?
- Never.

399
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,665
We have weapons in place
to disperse HEAT-16...

400
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,459
over half
of this godforsaken globe.

401
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,296
Soon the whole world
will be at my command.

402
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,381
Anyone who refuses
to join my consortium...

403
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,384
won't be around to argue.

404
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,839
Time to get reacquainted,
Jason.

405
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,009
Director Wynn,
Terry Fitzgerald is here.

406
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,386
Send him in.

407
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,139
Speak of the devil. Come in.
Good to see you.

408
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:42,682
Director, the car
is waiting downstairs.

409
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,018
Good.
You know Agent Priest.

410
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,604
Yes. Could I have
a word with you... alone?

411
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,941
Of course.
Would you excuse us?

412
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,778
Glad you dropped by, son.

413
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,614
I want to commend you
on your handling of the media.

414
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,824
Those rumors about me
were becoming a real headache.

415
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:03,203
- Let's have a drink.
- Thank you.

416
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,622
I know we've been
covering up problems...

417
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,124
with our missions overseas.

418
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,001
I really can't keep
lying like this, sir.

419
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,255
Lying? Really?

420
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,090
I'd like to put
a team together,

421
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,301
analyze the field op data,
get to the bottom of it.

422
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,470
But you're not
an analyst anymore.

423
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,889
There's no reason
not to take a look, sir.

424
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,184
- On the contrary.
- Beg your pardon?

425
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:31,982
Tell me...
how are Cyan and Wanda?

426
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,776
Little girl
just had a birthday, didn't she?

427
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,653
They're both fine.

428
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,196
I'm glad to hear that.

429
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,657
Now, let's get
something straight.

430
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,118
I run this organization
the way I see fit,

431
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,955
and I will do whatever is
necessary to keep it that way.

432
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,125
Your job is to make damn sure
the public agrees with me.

433
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,711
That clear enough?

434
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,547
Good.

435
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,639
The car is waiting.

436
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:55,190
Achmed and Abdullah.

437
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,317
Achmed, my friend.
Good to see you.

438
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,277
Abdullah, good to see you.

439
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,531
Up.

440
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,576
This one here.

441
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,412
Excuse us.

442
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,473
Excuse me, sir.
Urgent call.

443
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,767
Gentlemen...

444
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,060
Have you made a decision?

445
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:34,145
Your HEAT-16 test
was very impressive.

446
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,274
How do you control
delivery of the weapon?

447
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,484
It's the latest
in nanotechnology.

448
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,779
Let me assure you,
the weapon is problem-free.

449
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,532
We've already placed orders
with several of our allies.

450
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,411
You're becoming
quite a powerful man.

451
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,163
Your consortium will soon rival
the United Nations.

452
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,290
Not at all, sir.

453
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,584
I'm just a facilitator.
Thank you.

454
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,295
My partners
are the beneficiaries.

455
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,631
To my partners, gentlemen.

456
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,510
- Code red security breach, sir.
- Where?

457
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,220
At the armory.
A detail's en route.

458
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:11,141
I'm on my way.
Damn it.

459
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:14,311
Agent Priest has arrived.

460
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,655
Wait here.

461
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,908
There's been a break-in at A-6,
the armory.

462
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,784
- Who?
- We don't know.

463
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,536
There's a security detail
downstairs with Priest.

464
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,456
Let's get out of here.

465
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:53,058
You!

466
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,729
Who are you?

467
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,856
What's the matter, Jason?

468
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:03,568
You don't recognize
your own handiwork?

469
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,781
You left me to die
in that biochem plant, remember?

470
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,200
Simmons!

471
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,786
You sent me to Hell!

472
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,665
I'm here to return the favor!

473
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,509
I trusted you.

474
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:28,927
Jesus.

475
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,554
How could you marry Wanda?

476
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,472
How could you?

477
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:36,393
Al, when you died...

478
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,604
Wanda was devastated.

479
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:43,525
Do you know about Cyan?

480
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,573
Time to die, Jason.

481
00:40:56,538 --> 00:41:00,792
Nice outfit, asshole.

482
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,189
Damn.

483
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,399
What the Hell is that?

484
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,359
It's Simmons!

485
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,777
What are you talking about?

486
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,821
That thing is Simmons!

487
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,033
I want you to nail him now!

488
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:16,284
It's a little early
for Halloween.

489
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:21,122
Where you're going,
every day's Halloween.

490
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,629
You don't have the guts.

491
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,224
You're right.

492
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:40,517
Coming, coming.

493
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:44,354
Will that be the same
or separate checks, lady?

494
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:47,399
Just when I was getting sick
of you whining about Wanda,

495
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,692
you do us proud.

496
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,570
So congrats
on your first mission.

497
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,530
Go ahead.

498
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,491
Run!

499
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,413
Holy shit!

500
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,461
Shoot on sight.

501
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,713
I say again...
shoot on sight.

502
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:54,549
Get a light on him!

503
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:58,386
There!

504
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,367
- You see him?
- No, sir!

505
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,663
Where the hell did he go?

506
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,670
Negative, sir!

507
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,724
- There he is!
- All right! Take him!

508
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:30,020
What have we got here?

509
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,189
Gunshot wound
to the head, Doc.

510
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:33,857
Oh, she's dead.

511
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,484
Come on.

512
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,697
Easy.

513
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:47,704
Make some room here.

514
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,959
Put her around the back.

515
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,259
Why didn't you warn me
about Simmons?

516
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:03,220
Spawn was ready
sooner than I expected,

517
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:05,722
so don't get
your panties in a wad.

518
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,224
Always bitching at me...

519
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,683
"Why didn't you tell me
about Simmons?"

520
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:10,268
"Why didn't you tell me
it was going to hurt?"

521
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:11,728
"Am I going to go to Hell?"

522
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:14,064
Oh, grow up,
you syphilitic ball-sac.

523
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,024
At least you had fun
compared to them.

524
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:19,945
Fun? Does this look
like Playland to you?

525
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,322
He killed Priest!
He damn near killed me!

526
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:25,575
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

527
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:29,371
No, Jerky.
Jerky, Spawn's a big idiot.

528
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,791
Look, he's been through Hell.

529
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,461
As soon as he finishes
one more little detail,

530
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,255
he'll be ready to join us.

531
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:39,756
I've done my part.

532
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:43,885
How about yours?
How we doing on your front?

533
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,847
HEAT-16 is ready to go.

534
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,431
It better be.

535
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,141
The army's ready.

536
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,601
The Spawn's ready.

537
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,186
The HEAT-16
completes the picture.

538
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,604
Congrat-a-freak-a-lations.

539
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:57,274
What's Simmons got to do
with all this?

540
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,610
He's just the highest-scoring
killer of all time.

541
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:03,530
If we hadn't recruited him,
the other side would have.

542
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,949
I almost forgot again.

543
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:09,286
Memo from Brimstone Breath...

544
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,580
we're going to rig
a fancy-schmancy device...

545
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:14,583
that connects your heartbeat
to the HEAT-16 bomb,

546
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,919
so if your heart stops ticking,
the bomb goes off.

547
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:19,504
We don't want
any smart-ass fruitcake...

548
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,298
taking you out
ahead of schedule.

549
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:24,509
An insurance policy from Hell,
the good hands people.

550
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:26,469
That's a good idea.
I like that.

551
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,598
I want your special attention
dealing with Spawn, you hear me?

552
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,474
Gladly.

553
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:32,475
Good.

554
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:33,685
Now, stay sharp.

555
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:34,978
The night is young.

556
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:37,939
Ladies?

557
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:39,983
Ooh, Clownie.

558
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:41,151
Ah, yes.

559
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,945
Have you ever ridden
a clown's pink pony?

560
00:47:44,154 --> 00:47:47,073
I think it's about time.

561
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,996
When all the world is mine,

562
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:58,293
I will personally
fry your lard-ass.

563
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:00,545
As you've seen,

564
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:03,298
the terrible North Korean
biochemical disaster...

565
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:06,051
unleashed a whole host
of new diseases.

566
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,178
Ten thousand people died
in the first month...

567
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,430
after the disaster
five years ago.

568
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:13,517
Millions have contracted
these fatal diseases...

569
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,977
diphtheria, cholera,
smallpox...

570
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,313
diseases that had been
virtually wiped out.

571
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:21,358
Thought I was getting rid
of the world's vermin,

572
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:25,654
and I turn out to be
one of them.

573
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:30,325
The number of sick and dying
children continues to grow.

574
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:34,496
It's up to us to put an end...

575
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:37,207
to the suffering
of these innocent children.

576
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,168
Spaz!

577
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,802
What happened to you?

578
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,013
I was playing with Spaz,
and I fell down.

579
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:53,473
Are you all right?

580
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:57,727
Yeah, I'm OK.

581
00:48:57,894 --> 00:49:02,858
Wow. Your face is weird.

582
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:05,569
Cool.

583
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:08,697
What's your name?

584
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:10,365
Spawn.

585
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:13,785
I'm Cyan.

586
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:15,996
You have your mother's eyes.

587
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:19,749
I knew her a long time ago.

588
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:22,294
Let's get you
back to your mother.

589
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:24,421
My, my, my.

590
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,047
What a pretty little dress.

591
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:30,760
I wonder if she's got it
in my size?

592
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,345
Spawnie, Spawnie,
he's our man.

593
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:34,347
If he can't kill 'em,
no one can.

594
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:36,349
Yay, Spawnie!

595
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:39,561
"S" to the "p"
to the "a" to the "awn".

596
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:42,731
Go, Spawnie,
go, Spawnie!

597
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:46,276
You fool!

598
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,528
I put you on Earth...

599
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:52,032
to make sure Spawn keeps
his end of the bargain.

600
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,701
Why'd you pick him
to lead the army anyway?

601
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:55,702
What are you thinking?

602
00:49:55,911 --> 00:49:57,495
It should be me.

603
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,331
I had the tenure.

604
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:02,792
It's not fair!
It's not fair!

605
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,045
And that's exactly
the kind of talk...

606
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:07,714
we don't tolerate
around here, right, boss?

607
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:09,257
Enough!

608
00:50:09,466 --> 00:50:11,009
Spawn must choose...

609
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:14,554
to murder Wynn
and release the virus.

610
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:18,808
Then my army will be complete.

611
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:20,143
Now, now, boss...

612
00:50:20,352 --> 00:50:24,064
This is your last chance.

613
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:26,942
Thank you.

614
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:32,989
Excuse me.
Cyan!

615
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:36,201
Honey, didn't I tell you
not to leave my sight?

616
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:39,996
I was playing with Spaz,
and I fell down,

617
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:42,541
and Spawn came and helped me.

618
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,835
You're not supposed to talk
to strangers, either.

619
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:48,505
Spawn's not a stranger, Mommy.

620
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:54,886
- We're going home right now.
- What's going on?

621
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,388
- What is going on?
- I'll explain later.

622
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:57,556
No, explain now.

623
00:50:57,764 --> 00:51:00,392
I'm not going through
this again. No secrets.

624
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,269
Wynn was attacked
at the reception.

625
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:06,356
I don't want
to take any chances.

626
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,484
Trust me.

627
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:26,334
Go home.

628
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:31,298
Fix your seat belt, honey.

629
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:32,924
What the hell is going on?

630
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:37,179
Daddy, what about Spaz?

631
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:40,807
Spaz?

632
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:45,812
Go home, Spaz.

633
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:52,235
He knows the way back home
better than we do.

634
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:58,533
Let's go, Terry.

635
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:11,922
You don't want to be
where I'm going.

636
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:18,929
But it's your funeral.

637
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:38,823
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

638
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:40,951
Puking up decent food, boy?

639
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,787
It's rotten.

640
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,292
You think we eat so good you can
just spit up what you like?

641
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:52,546
Don't talk back to me.

642
00:52:57,759 --> 00:53:00,762
Eat this!

643
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,065
No, don't!
He's my dad.

644
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,454
Keep away from him.

645
00:53:29,082 --> 00:53:30,041
B.P. And heart rate?

646
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,878
One-thirty-four over 77,
heart rate, 60.

647
00:53:33,086 --> 00:53:37,132
Let's increase the flow
to 3.5.

648
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,511
We're ready for the monitor.

649
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:45,307
I'll make a small incision...

650
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:48,059
so that we can insert
this heart monitor.

651
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:51,813
You'll feel a slight pinch.

652
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:24,554
Awesome hardware.
What will you do with it?

653
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:28,391
Throw someone
a going-away party.

654
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,727
Need any help?

655
00:54:30,936 --> 00:54:32,854
Listen, kid...

656
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:36,525
I'm not looking
to make friends.

657
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:46,576
- What's your name?
- Zack.

658
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:49,371
I'm Al.

659
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:52,541
That's Spaz.

660
00:55:00,048 --> 00:55:03,134
Breathe normally, Director.

661
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,306
The system is now operational.

662
00:55:08,515 --> 00:55:10,559
As per your orders,
Director Wynn,

663
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:13,770
if your vital signs flatline
for any reason,

664
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:17,607
the device will uplink
and detonate the HEAT-16 bombs.

665
00:55:17,816 --> 00:55:20,068
No one would dare kill you.

666
00:55:20,277 --> 00:55:24,030
Good work, Doc.

667
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,616
What a double cross.

668
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:30,620
I got Wynn to kill Spawn
and create the HEAT-16 bomb.

669
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:34,833
Now I get Spawn to murder Wynn
and release the virus.

670
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:39,004
If all goes well,
it should hurt like hell.

671
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:43,300
I can't believe I actually
got Wynn to get operated.

672
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:44,551
What a maroon.

673
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,262
It's going to send Earth
into a tailspin...

674
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,099
of death and destruction.

675
00:56:00,442 --> 00:56:03,153
It's time.

676
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:11,328
Sometimes I wake up at night
down in the alley and wonder...

677
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:12,787
Is this Hell?

678
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:14,581
Not yet...

679
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:17,709
but soon.

680
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:20,170
Heads up.

681
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:23,006
Got one.

682
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:25,133
Who's your new friend, Spawn?

683
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:27,052
- Get out of here, Zack.
- But...

684
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,013
- Go!

685
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:38,355
Miss me?

686
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:42,150
Here's Clownie!

687
00:56:42,692 --> 00:56:45,695
It was you who told Wynn
to kill me.

688
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:48,657
Guilty as charged.

689
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:51,034
Before I blow
your fat circus ass away,

690
00:56:51,243 --> 00:56:53,620
tell me why you picked me
to lead your war.

691
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:57,666
If it isn't Curious Crispy.

692
00:56:57,874 --> 00:56:59,167
The evil's been there...

693
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:02,045
since you were soup
in your mama's crotch.

694
00:57:02,254 --> 00:57:06,258
Your DNA spelled DOA,
and we just nursed it along.

695
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:10,387
Those assassin missions were
just training for what's coming.

696
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:13,515
Let's get down to business.

697
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:16,726
Wynn's finally got
that HEAT-16 virus bomb working.

698
00:57:16,935 --> 00:57:18,228
Made especially for you.

699
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:22,190
Get things started with
a big, wet, infectious...

700
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:27,153
All you have to do is just
lead us to the holy land,

701
00:57:27,362 --> 00:57:31,116
so we can burn it down.

702
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,619
You filthy
little piece of vermin.

703
00:57:34,828 --> 00:57:37,831
What makes you think
I would join your army?

704
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:40,542
You can take your army
and shove it.

705
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,587
Sounds like a country song...
"Take your army and shove it".

706
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:46,756
You've got that "I want to beat
the fat little man"...

707
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:49,885
look in your eye.

708
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:55,390
I'm going to cut you
into 50 pieces...

709
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,475
and mail you to every state.

710
00:57:57,684 --> 00:58:01,396
I'll take your intestines and...

711
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:06,902
I don't know how you put up
with this crap.

712
00:58:06,943 --> 00:58:08,737
You're a bigger fool
than I thought...

713
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:11,239
if you think you're going
to wreck my plans.

714
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:13,033
You'll do what you promised.

715
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:15,410
Put down my dog.

716
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:17,537
Nice doggie.

717
00:58:17,746 --> 00:58:19,789
Heel, fetch...

718
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:22,626
No, I got it.

719
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:26,087
Play dead!

720
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,555
You want to do it the hard way?

721
00:58:35,764 --> 00:58:37,224
I warned you.

722
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:40,936
I'll just
have to teach you a lesson.

723
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,563
No more clowning around.

724
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:45,440
I'm not the vindicator...

725
00:58:45,649 --> 00:58:47,442
or the victimizer...

726
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:51,196
or the vaporizer
or the vibrator.

727
00:58:51,404 --> 00:58:53,114
I'm...

728
00:58:53,323 --> 00:58:57,160
the violator!

729
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:01,099
Good Lord!

730
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:07,898
I ain't staying!

731
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:09,960
Damn alley ain't safe no more!

732
01:01:18,844 --> 01:01:21,721
We're going.

733
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:41,885
Violator, one,
Spawnie-boy, zero.

734
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:49,643
You've been violated,
girlie-man, huh?

735
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:51,978
I could have killed you
like that.

736
01:02:52,187 --> 01:02:54,898
Is that a little more surprise
than you wanted?

737
01:02:55,106 --> 01:02:59,653
Twinkle, twinkle,
little Spawn.

738
01:02:59,861 --> 01:03:01,071
You look like crap.

739
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:04,074
Go fertilize my lawn.

740
01:03:04,282 --> 01:03:06,201
You're not excited yet?

741
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:09,204
Helter-skelter's coming down
with or without you.

742
01:03:09,412 --> 01:03:11,081
Either you lead the army,

743
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:13,917
or Wynn plays
pin-the-tail on Wanda.

744
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:17,504
"Hey, Wanda, come on,
give me that sweet stuff."

745
01:03:17,712 --> 01:03:21,007
"Oh, no. Oh, please,
Wynn, don't."

746
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:23,885
"Somebody help me."

747
01:03:24,094 --> 01:03:26,054
Forget Terry.

748
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:31,601
It's my turn to ride
the Wanda carousel of love.

749
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:35,522
Stay away from her.

750
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,232
Your choice.

751
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,692
See you at Wanda's.

752
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,612
Last one there
gets her rotten eggs.

753
01:03:43,738 --> 01:03:47,117
Wynn and Wanda
sitting in a tree,

754
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:50,287
s-u-c-k-i-n-g.

755
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:53,748
First comes love...

756
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:58,628
The truth
has taken its toll on you.

757
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,630
I'm going to kill
that asshole.

758
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:04,968
You still haven't learned.

759
01:04:27,115 --> 01:04:30,410
Clearance granted.

760
01:04:37,709 --> 01:04:41,796
Downloading secure files.

761
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:52,557
Gotcha, Jason.

762
01:04:53,558 --> 01:04:57,354
I can't afford to be wrong.

763
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:08,198
Still with us, I see.

764
01:05:24,214 --> 01:05:25,882
Your vengeance...

765
01:05:26,091 --> 01:05:27,384
their pain.

766
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:31,847
Wynn, Wanda...
none of this is worth the cost.

767
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:35,809
Those are the only things
that matter to me now.

768
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:37,686
Al Simmons is dead.

769
01:05:37,894 --> 01:05:39,563
Let him go.

770
01:05:39,771 --> 01:05:43,650
I am Simmons, old man.

771
01:05:47,529 --> 01:05:48,905
You're Spawn now,

772
01:05:49,114 --> 01:05:53,493
but that doesn't mean
you have to be what they want.

773
01:06:02,127 --> 01:06:04,504
You're still
letting them get to you.

774
01:06:04,713 --> 01:06:06,298
Your anger is your weakness.

775
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:09,718
They'll use it to rob you
of any humanity you have left.

776
01:06:09,926 --> 01:06:11,720
Al Simmons knew that violence...

777
01:06:11,928 --> 01:06:14,431
only makes for
more pain and suffering.

778
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:16,308
He tried to leave off killing,

779
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:19,186
give himself a second chance.

780
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:23,940
Your old life is gone.
Accept that.

781
01:06:24,983 --> 01:06:26,693
I still love Wanda.

782
01:06:26,902 --> 01:06:28,904
Put her in the past.

783
01:06:29,112 --> 01:06:31,156
It's the only way
you can be free.

784
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:34,993
She's the only reason
I'm here.

785
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:39,873
The war between
Heaven and Hell...

786
01:06:40,081 --> 01:06:42,292
depends on the choices we make,

787
01:06:42,501 --> 01:06:45,337
and those choices
require sacrifice.

788
01:06:45,545 --> 01:06:48,465
That's the test.

789
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:58,934
I didn't know
this was going to happen.

790
01:06:58,934 --> 01:07:02,646
I'm going to nail that scumbag.

791
01:07:18,787 --> 01:07:20,163
Kiss it good-bye, Clown.

792
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:24,459
This is just what they want.
You're playing their game.

793
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:26,294
Then I'll play dirty.

794
01:07:26,503 --> 01:07:31,424
- Guns are useless.
- You got a better idea?

795
01:07:45,188 --> 01:07:47,941
I might.

796
01:07:51,653 --> 01:07:55,156
You've been using
your armor only by reflex.

797
01:07:55,365 --> 01:07:57,117
You must learn to control it.

798
01:07:57,325 --> 01:07:59,369
It has trillions
of neuroconnections.

799
01:07:59,578 --> 01:08:02,497
They're a living extension
of your own instincts,

800
01:08:02,706 --> 01:08:05,417
instantly translating
your thought...

801
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:07,711
into physical reality,

802
01:08:07,919 --> 01:08:12,549
so long as you stay
clear and focused.

803
01:08:13,425 --> 01:08:16,970
So... that's how it works.

804
01:08:25,353 --> 01:08:28,315
- Cool!
- Now try your chains.

805
01:08:33,278 --> 01:08:36,114
You must visualize
your objective.

806
01:08:36,323 --> 01:08:37,824
The armor does the rest.

807
01:08:38,033 --> 01:08:41,036
All right, Yoda. Wait.

808
01:08:41,953 --> 01:08:44,497
You ready?

809
01:08:44,915 --> 01:08:47,584
All right, go!

810
01:08:54,216 --> 01:08:56,968
Not bad.

811
01:08:56,968 --> 01:08:58,386
Don't get cocky.

812
01:08:58,595 --> 01:09:00,514
You've a lot more to learn.

813
01:09:00,722 --> 01:09:03,016
Your cape has its own powers.

814
01:09:03,225 --> 01:09:06,603
I have to get to Wanda's.

815
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:11,358
Take care of your powers.

816
01:09:11,566 --> 01:09:14,236
When you drain them,
you die.

817
01:09:14,444 --> 01:09:17,489
Won't be needing these.

818
01:09:19,658 --> 01:09:22,577
You're catching on.

819
01:09:23,453 --> 01:09:26,623
Or this.

820
01:09:31,002 --> 01:09:33,296
I want you to return Spaz to me.

821
01:09:33,505 --> 01:09:37,300
No matter how you find him.
Understand?

822
01:09:45,016 --> 01:09:46,810
Now...

823
01:09:47,018 --> 01:09:50,105
the final test.

824
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:03,410
Get out of my way!

825
01:10:05,704 --> 01:10:07,497
I'll get Spawn so worked up,

826
01:10:07,706 --> 01:10:11,001
he'll kill Wynn
without blinking.

827
01:10:13,211 --> 01:10:14,337
When I'm done with you,

828
01:10:14,546 --> 01:10:17,757
they'll change your name
to "Stain".

829
01:10:27,392 --> 01:10:30,437
Look, Ma, no hands!

830
01:10:48,455 --> 01:10:49,748
I love the smell...

831
01:10:49,956 --> 01:10:53,710
of burning asphalt
in the morning!

832
01:10:59,925 --> 01:11:03,720
Send a boy to do a clown's job?

833
01:11:05,055 --> 01:11:09,893
It's an honor to be
a Hellspawn, you hear me?

834
01:11:19,236 --> 01:11:21,780
That's not fair!

835
01:11:23,782 --> 01:11:27,369
Time for some necro-goo!

836
01:11:27,953 --> 01:11:33,166
Open wide and say "Aah"!

837
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:17,085
See you at Wanda's!

838
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:53,038
Reading secure files.

839
01:12:56,499 --> 01:12:58,418
Christ.

840
01:12:58,627 --> 01:13:02,464
Wynn is out of his mind.

841
01:13:25,362 --> 01:13:28,657
I'm thirsty.

842
01:13:29,783 --> 01:13:32,035
OK, baby.

843
01:13:32,244 --> 01:13:35,705
You want some water?

844
01:13:35,914 --> 01:13:38,875
Establishing connection.

845
01:13:39,084 --> 01:13:40,544
What have you got?

846
01:13:40,752 --> 01:13:44,047
Black bag ops,
assassination lists, everything.

847
01:13:44,256 --> 01:13:46,550
Wynn's been using A-6
to run a criminal consortium.

848
01:13:46,758 --> 01:13:50,053
He's got some biological weapon
called HEAT-16.

849
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:51,346
It's all there?

850
01:13:51,555 --> 01:13:53,223
I want to get it
on tonight's news.

851
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:55,225
I'm e-mailing you a copy.

852
01:13:55,433 --> 01:13:57,894
It should be enough
to bury Wynn.

853
01:13:58,103 --> 01:14:01,022
Great.

854
01:14:03,066 --> 01:14:03,984
Daddy?

855
01:14:04,192 --> 01:14:07,737
Hey, sweetheart.

856
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:15,203
What are you doing here?

857
01:14:15,787 --> 01:14:18,957
Some unfinished business.

858
01:14:20,959 --> 01:14:25,130
You disappoint me, Terry.

859
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,430
You can't release the virus.

860
01:14:33,638 --> 01:14:35,223
Millions of people will die.

861
01:14:35,432 --> 01:14:39,311
Only those
who refuse to join me.

862
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:47,569
You're a very lucky man.

863
01:14:48,445 --> 01:14:52,282
Whatever it is you want,
just take it and go.

864
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:55,744
I intend to.

865
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:01,958
Let's go.

866
01:15:04,336 --> 01:15:06,421
On the floor.

867
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:11,259
The kid stays with me.
Answer the door.

868
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,471
Go on.

869
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:18,600
It's all right, sweetheart.

870
01:15:21,686 --> 01:15:23,563
Peek-a-boo.

871
01:15:23,772 --> 01:15:27,234
I see you.

872
01:15:27,692 --> 01:15:30,445
This place
is hard to find in the dark.

873
01:15:30,654 --> 01:15:34,616
I smell you're not
wearing any panties.

874
01:15:35,784 --> 01:15:39,955
Hello, Cyan. Remember me?

875
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,417
You were at my birthday party.

876
01:15:44,626 --> 01:15:46,503
No duh.

877
01:15:46,711 --> 01:15:48,672
What are you,
a regular Einstein?

878
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,674
You sure know
how to raise them.

879
01:15:50,882 --> 01:15:53,093
Don't you touch her.

880
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:54,386
Back off, hero.

881
01:15:54,594 --> 01:15:57,681
I'm back by popular demand.

882
01:15:57,889 --> 01:16:01,726
Big as life and twice as rotten.

883
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,071
Does wonders for my asthma.

884
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,865
Where's Spawn?

885
01:16:15,073 --> 01:16:16,616
Let's cut the crap.

886
01:16:16,825 --> 01:16:19,703
Spawn's on his way.
You ready to play?

887
01:16:19,911 --> 01:16:21,454
Of course I am.

888
01:16:21,663 --> 01:16:25,041
You better be.

889
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:32,966
You don't know how much
your heart means to me.

890
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:37,637
Bring 'em, Jerky.

891
01:16:37,846 --> 01:16:40,640
Come on.

892
01:17:09,878 --> 01:17:12,589
Help me, please.

893
01:17:12,797 --> 01:17:13,798
Careful.

894
01:17:14,007 --> 01:17:16,968
Don't make me nervous.
I might nick something vital.

895
01:17:17,177 --> 01:17:20,055
- Get away from her.
- I can't do that.

896
01:17:20,263 --> 01:17:22,140
She wants me.

897
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:24,935
You touch her,
and you die slow.

898
01:17:25,143 --> 01:17:26,353
All right, Spawn.

899
01:17:26,561 --> 01:17:28,063
No more fun and games.

900
01:17:28,271 --> 01:17:31,316
Either you join Hell's army,
or she dies...

901
01:17:31,525 --> 01:17:33,276
after I'm done.

902
01:17:33,485 --> 01:17:35,904
I will rip your heart out!
Let her go.

903
01:17:36,112 --> 01:17:39,449
So what's it gonna be?

904
01:17:39,491 --> 01:17:42,702
Time's running out.

905
01:17:45,789 --> 01:17:48,667
Too late.

906
01:18:12,357 --> 01:18:13,817
It's all your fault, Spawn.

907
01:18:14,025 --> 01:18:16,778
She was doing fine
till you showed up.

908
01:18:16,987 --> 01:18:19,531
Now you've got nothing
left to lose.

909
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:22,534
You're a soulless corpse!

910
01:18:22,742 --> 01:18:25,537
Nothing!

911
01:18:25,745 --> 01:18:28,748
You're wrong.

912
01:18:31,418 --> 01:18:34,462
I've still got you.

913
01:18:44,764 --> 01:18:47,809
Don't be afraid.

914
01:18:51,104 --> 01:18:53,815
- You can't kill me.
- Is that right?

915
01:18:54,024 --> 01:18:56,234
If my heart stops,
the virus is released,

916
01:18:56,443 --> 01:18:57,861
and everybody
in the world dies.

917
01:18:58,069 --> 01:19:00,238
Like you said...

918
01:19:00,447 --> 01:19:04,159
I've got nothing else to lose.

919
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:16,213
That's right.
Feel the burn.

920
01:19:16,421 --> 01:19:18,590
Get used to it.
It's payback time.

921
01:19:18,798 --> 01:19:22,594
See you in Hell, Jason.

922
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:33,271
If you kill me, you kill her!

923
01:20:05,846 --> 01:20:09,891
I'm through
doing Hell's dirty work.

924
01:20:21,486 --> 01:20:25,282
You worthless bag of...

925
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:27,909
How could you let him kill me?

926
01:20:28,118 --> 01:20:31,955
The most important thing in your
entire freakin' universe!

927
01:20:32,163 --> 01:20:38,295
Whatever happened to love,
honor, respect?

928
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:43,133
You pansy bacon-crisp!

929
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,514
You should have killed him!

930
01:20:49,723 --> 01:20:53,643
Popped his head like a zit.

931
01:20:53,852 --> 01:20:56,479
It feels... so good.

932
01:20:56,688 --> 01:21:01,484
And feel that butt.
It feels so... hairy.

933
01:21:04,196 --> 01:21:05,488
Joke's over.

934
01:21:05,697 --> 01:21:08,491
You should have killed Jason
when you had the chance.

935
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,659
Never.

936
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:13,747
What do you mean never?
Never?

937
01:21:13,955 --> 01:21:16,166
Do you know how hard
I've been working on this?

938
01:21:16,374 --> 01:21:20,504
You set me up,
you malignant sow!

939
01:21:20,712 --> 01:21:23,715
What do you think you got
the pacemaker for?

940
01:21:23,924 --> 01:21:25,342
Your perfect
attendance record,

941
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:27,469
you spoon-sucking dipstick?

942
01:21:27,677 --> 01:21:29,471
I was counting on
Spawn killing you.

943
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:31,097
Then you would get his soul...

944
01:21:31,306 --> 01:21:33,517
and kick-start
the apocalypse now.

945
01:21:33,725 --> 01:21:37,020
I say destroy the cosmos,
ask questions later.

946
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:38,855
But first...

947
01:21:39,064 --> 01:21:44,152
first, I want to slaughter
each and every one of you.

948
01:21:44,236 --> 01:21:50,075
And then I'm gonna have a little
creme de Wanda.

949
01:21:51,368 --> 01:21:55,038
I'll let you watch, too.

950
01:21:56,748 --> 01:21:59,543
Yummy yum.

951
01:22:05,715 --> 01:22:08,927
Tastes like chicken.

952
01:22:10,929 --> 01:22:12,764
Cogliostro!

953
01:22:12,973 --> 01:22:16,476
Come and get me!

954
01:22:27,362 --> 01:22:29,865
He'll be back.

955
01:22:30,073 --> 01:22:31,908
Concentrate on healing.

956
01:22:32,117 --> 01:22:35,537
Come on!

957
01:22:38,623 --> 01:22:43,044
I may not be able
to hold him off alone.

958
01:22:45,297 --> 01:22:51,219
Come on down to my world
and die, suckers!

959
01:23:13,783 --> 01:23:16,995
All right,
you overgrown gecko...

960
01:23:17,204 --> 01:23:21,124
Come and get your throat cut.

961
01:25:11,026 --> 01:25:14,154
If you won't lead my army,

962
01:25:14,362 --> 01:25:18,742
then you must die.

963
01:25:20,285 --> 01:25:22,078
Never!

964
01:25:22,287 --> 01:25:26,249
Bring me Spawn's head.

965
01:25:57,989 --> 01:26:02,118
You will never escape me.

966
01:26:24,516 --> 01:26:27,602
It's all right now, baby.

967
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,943
Come on.

968
01:26:43,368 --> 01:26:45,495
They belong together.

969
01:26:45,704 --> 01:26:49,791
There's no place for me here.

970
01:26:51,418 --> 01:26:54,129
Maybe you're the one
after all.

971
01:26:54,337 --> 01:26:58,675
You were checking me out
from the start, weren't you?

972
01:26:58,884 --> 01:27:00,135
I'm too old for this.

973
01:27:00,343 --> 01:27:02,554
Not as quick as I used to be.

974
01:27:02,762 --> 01:27:04,723
I've fought this war
long enough.

975
01:27:04,931 --> 01:27:06,683
It's time for someone
to take over.

976
01:27:06,892 --> 01:27:10,604
What if I sided with Clown?

977
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:13,732
I'd have killed you.

978
01:27:15,275 --> 01:27:17,986
Right.

979
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:29,581
- I followed him here.
- Thanks, kid.

980
01:28:17,087 --> 01:28:20,465
Use your armor!

981
01:28:23,885 --> 01:28:26,972
Concentrate!

982
01:28:28,598 --> 01:28:31,601
Bite this!

983
01:28:35,647 --> 01:28:39,234
Cut off his head!

984
01:28:54,666 --> 01:28:57,919
You'll pay for this.

985
01:28:58,295 --> 01:29:00,130
It's not over yet.

986
01:29:00,338 --> 01:29:02,132
I'll gum you to death.

987
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,218
I'll bite you.

988
01:29:05,427 --> 01:29:09,598
Wanda, what do you think
about a little head?

989
01:29:11,892 --> 01:29:13,685
This is your last chance
to join up.

990
01:29:13,894 --> 01:29:15,187
Think about it.

991
01:29:15,395 --> 01:29:17,856
Come on.

992
01:29:21,735 --> 01:29:23,153
You'll pay for this.

993
01:29:23,361 --> 01:29:25,864
Give my regards to your boss.

994
01:29:26,072 --> 01:29:29,409
Tell him he's next.

995
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:39,836
I'm gonna die!

996
01:29:40,045 --> 01:29:43,632
Not bad for a dead man.

997
01:29:44,049 --> 01:29:46,968
Beginner's luck.

998
01:29:49,513 --> 01:29:51,348
Come on, folks.
Let's move back, please.

999
01:29:51,556 --> 01:29:54,351
Is it true the documents
you've uncovered...

1000
01:29:54,559 --> 01:29:55,852
implicate Jason Wynn?

1001
01:29:56,061 --> 01:29:59,606
Yes. For the past five years,
I unwittingly participated...

1002
01:29:59,814 --> 01:30:01,900
in Jason Wynn's illegal
manipulation of the A-6...

1003
01:30:02,108 --> 01:30:04,653
to further his ambitions
for worldwide power.

1004
01:30:04,861 --> 01:30:07,155
What took you
so long to respond?

1005
01:30:07,364 --> 01:30:09,658
Are the HEAT-16 bombs
still a danger?

1006
01:30:09,866 --> 01:30:14,496
The entire HEAT-16 weapon system
has already been destroyed.

1007
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,623
Do you have
any further comments?

1008
01:30:16,831 --> 01:30:19,167
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

1009
01:30:19,376 --> 01:30:21,378
The documents I release
to all media outlets...

1010
01:30:21,586 --> 01:30:23,380
will answer the rest
of your questions.

1011
01:30:23,588 --> 01:30:27,509
Thank you.

1012

Spawn has stopped...

1013
01:31:05,755 --> 01:31:09,134
Malebolgia's plans
to destroy the Earth.

1014
01:31:09,342 --> 01:31:13,305
The choice has been made.

1015
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,808
For now.
