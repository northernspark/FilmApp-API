2
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,560
Who am I? You sure you want to know?

3
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,880
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.

4
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,560
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...

5
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,040
... if somebody told you I was just an
average ordinary guy, not a care in the world...

6
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,920
... somebody lied.

7
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,200
But let me assure you, this
like any story worth telling...

8
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,720
... is all about a girl.

9
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,840
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

10
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,960
The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.

11
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,680
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.

12
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,760
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

13
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,520
Hey! Stop the bus!

14
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,600
That's me.

15
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Tell him to stop! Please!

16
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,960
Stop!

17
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,280
Hey! Stop the bus!

18
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,400
Stop the bus! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Blvd.

19
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,760
Catch a cab, Parker!

20
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,720
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

21
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,160
What a geek!

22
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,840
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

23
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Would you date him?

24
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,800
Midtown High seniors.

25
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,520
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

26
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,120
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

27
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,600
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

28
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,920
So behave accordingly.

29
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

30
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,760
Come on, stay together.

31
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,720
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

32
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,760
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

33
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,360
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

34
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
- Dad would you ask Hoskins to drive around the corner please.
- Why?

35
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,640
The entrance is right there.

36
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,360
Dad these are public school kids,
I'm not showing up for the field trip in a Rolls.

37
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,800
You want me to trade in my care for a Jetta

38
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,640
just because you flunked out of every private school I ever sent you to?

39
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,840
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

40
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,640
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

41
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,080
It's just...

42
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,640
Just what, Harry?

43
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,280
Forget it.

44
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
Pete!

45
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

46
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,200
- Harry! Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks Dad.

47
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,920
- Um, Peter may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.

48
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,440
- It's a great honour to meet you sir.
- Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.

49
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,400
Y'know, I'm something of a scientist myself.

50
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,600
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really Brilliant.

51
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,680
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

52
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,040
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

53
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,560
- I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!

54
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,240
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

55
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,840
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,880
I think he wants to adopt you.

57
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,600
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

58
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,400
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

59
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,640
That's amazing!

60
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
This is the most advanced electron
microscope in the eastern seaboard.

61
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,840
It's unreal.

62
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,680
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

63
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,240
...varying strengths which help them
in their constant search for food.

64
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,480
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

65
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,640
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

66
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,480
For the school paper?

67
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,600
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...

68
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,600
...genus Kukulcania.

69
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,000
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web whose strands
have a tensile strength

70
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,240
...proportionately equal to the type of high tension wire...

71
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,280
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

72
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,320
Or his father will fire your father.

73
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,960
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

74
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,520
What is going on?

75
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,640
The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.

76
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,760
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.

77
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,920
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

78
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,480
...that some researchers believe
it almost borders on precognition.

79
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,720
-Those guys are jerks.
-...an imminent awareness of danger...

80
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,600
A spider-sense.

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,800
Hey, look at that spider.

82
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,200
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

83
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,280
It's a defense mechanism.

84
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,600
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?

85
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,920
Who wouldn't?

86
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,760
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility has...

87
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,120
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

88
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,880
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

89
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,600
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

90
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,120
I love them!

91
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,240
Yeah, me too.

92
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,880
You know, spiders can change
their color...

93
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,720
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

94
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,840
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

95
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,280
...transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

96
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,440
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

97
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,080
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

98
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,680
There's 14.

99
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
I beg your pardon?

100
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,040
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

101
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,360
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

102
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,360
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the eastern seaboard?

103
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,440
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

104
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,280
Let's talk about how we listen.

105
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,520
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

106
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,120
...but at Midtown High...

107
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,840
Hey, Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

108
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
- Sure, yeah.
- Great.

109
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,800
Where do you want me?
Over here?

110
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,280
Yeah, that's great.

111
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,280
Don't make me look ugly.

112
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,400
That's impossible.

113
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,560
Perfect.

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,480
- Is that good?
- Great.

115
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,120
That's great.

116
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,400
M.J., let's go!

117
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,360
Wait. Thanks!

118
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,920
Parker, let's do it.

119
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,280
We've solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

120
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,880
I've already seen the glider.

121
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,240
That's not what I'm here for.

122
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,000
General Slocum, good to see you again.

123
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

124
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

125
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,440
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors pay us a little visit.

126
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
I want to see the progress report on
Human performance enhancers.

127
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,960
We tried vapour inhalation with rodent subjects.

128
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,760
They showed an 800 percent increase in strength.

129
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,360
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

130
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,560
-In one trial yes.
-It was an aberration.

131
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,280
All the tests since
have been successful.

132
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,040
In the trial that went wrong, what happen?
what were the side effects?

133
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,440
Violence, aggression...

134
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,280
...and insanity.

135
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,080
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

136
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,000
With the exception of Dr. Strom our entire staff
certifies the product

137
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,960
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

138
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,760
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

139
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,280
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

140
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,160
I'm going to be frank with you.

141
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,040
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

142
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,840
Norman, the General gave the go-ahead
to request aerospace

143
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,800
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

144
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,880
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your so-called performance enhancers

145
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,960
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

146
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,400
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

147
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,720
Gentlemen. Ladies.

148
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,800
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.

149
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

150
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,840
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

151
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,480
I'm already on my ass, May.

152
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,960
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

153
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,720
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

154
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,160
Hand me that dish. The green one.

155
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,040
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

156
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,280
...and upsizing their profits.

157
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,320
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

158
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,080
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

159
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,840
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

160
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,560
Computer...

161
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,360
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

162
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,120
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

163
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

164
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,440
I love you. And Peter loves you.

165
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,800
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

166
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,280
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

167
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,480
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

168
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,120
How you doing? How was the field trip?

169
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

170
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,560
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks, had a bite.

171
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,040
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

172
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,560
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

173
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,440
What's that all about?

174
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,960
In this recombination lab...

175
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,560
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

176
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,680
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

177
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,480
... into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

178
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,160
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

179
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,520
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

180
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,200
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

181
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,480
Don't be a coward.

182
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Risks are part of laboratory science.

183
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,160
Let me reschedule,
with the proper medical staff and a volunteer.

184
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,720
- If you just give me two weeks...
- Two weeks?

185
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,200
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

186
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,000
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

187
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,720
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

188
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,480
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

189
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,880
40,000 years of evolution...

190
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,640
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

191
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,200
Oh, that's cold.

192
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,480
Norman?

193
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,040
Norman!

194
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,600
Oh, my God.

195
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,400
Oh, my God!

196
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,720
Oh, my God! Norman!

197
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,000
Back to formula?

198
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,640
Weird.

199
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,440
- Peter?
- Yeah?

200
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,320
Are you all right?

201
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,720
I'm fine.

202
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,520
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?

203
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,320
Yep. Big change.

204
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,320
- Well, hurry up. You're going to be late.
- Right.

205
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,280
Okay.

206
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,440
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

207
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
- I got better.
- See?

208
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,720
- Bye, guys.

209
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,960
- You haven't eaten anything, have you got your lunch money?
- Yeah I've got it.

210
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,320
Hey Michaelangelo don't forget
we're painting the kitchen right after school. Got it?

211
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,160
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

212
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,360
And don't start up with me.

213
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,400
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

214
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,880
You're trash!
You're always going to be trash just like her.

215
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,480
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

216
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
Hi, M.J.

217
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,040
Hey, M.J.

218
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,640
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

219
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,000
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

220
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,440
I got the car. Hop in.

221
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,360
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

222
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,240
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

223
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
Or not.

224
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,520
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

225
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,440
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

226
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,400
Tell him to stop.

227
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,960
- Check him out!
- Dork!

228
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
Dad!

229
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,960
Dad, are you all right?

230
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,000
Harry.

231
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,120
What are you doing on the floor?

232
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,560
I don't know.

233
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,600
Have you been there all night?

234
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,720
Last night I was...

235
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,160
What?

236
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,040
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

237
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,480
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

238
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,800
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

239
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
What?

240
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,560
They found his body this morning
in the lab. He's been murdered, sir.

241
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,960
- What are you talking about?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

242
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,040
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.

243
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,600
Wow! Great reflexes!

244
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,520
- Thanks.
- No problem.

245
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,320
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

246
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,640
You just get contacts?

247
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,200
Well, see you.

248
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,640
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

249
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,400
Did you see that?

250
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,520
Parker?

251
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,400
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny don't you, freak?

252
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,440
- Flash it was just an accident.
-My fist breaking your teeth is the accident.

253
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,240
-C'mon Flash, stop.
-I don't want to fight you Flash.

254
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,680
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

255
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,080
Help him, Harry.

256
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,280
How'd he do that?

257
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,520
Which one?

258
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,000
He's all yours, man.

259
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,520
Flash, get up!

260
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

261
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,360
That was amazing.

262
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,160
I'm out of here. Come on.

263
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Go, web!

264
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,120
Fly.

265
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Up, up and away, web.

266
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,520
Shazam!

267
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,280
Go! Go!

268
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,200
Go, web, go!

269
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,640
Tallyho.

270
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,240
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

271
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,640
Bring me some beer.

272
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,280
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

273
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,880
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

274
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,280
You're as stupid as your mother.

275
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,560
Where's she going?
Where you going?

276
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,800
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

277
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,160
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

278
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,320
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

279
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,920
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

280
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,360
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

281
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,160
I guess you can always hear us.

282
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,520
Everybody shouts.

283
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,000
Your aunt and uncle don't.

284
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,600
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

285
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,000
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

286
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,800
You really freaked us out.

287
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,160
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

288
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,240
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

289
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,280
So where are you going
after you graduate?

290
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,040
I wanna move into the city.

291
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,520
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

292
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,400
Work my way through college.

293
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,640
What about you?

294
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,720
Headed for the city too.

295
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,560
Can't wait to get out of here.

296
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,120
I wanna...

297
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,760
What?

298
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,640
No, come on. Try me.

299
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,960
I wanna...

300
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,320
...act...

301
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,880
...on-stage.

302
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,200
Really?

303
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,640
Oh, that's perfect.

304
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,360
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

305
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,920
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

307
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,520
Peter, that was first grade.

308
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
Well...

309
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,400
...even so.

310
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,200
Sometimes...

311
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
...you know people.

312
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,160
You can just see what's coming.

313
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,760
What do you see coming for you?

314
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,840
I don't know.

315
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,560
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

316
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,800
And what for me?

317
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,240
For you?

318
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,240
You're gonna light up Broadway.

319
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,960
You know...

320
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,680
...you're taller than you look.

321
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,320
I hunch.

322
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,920
Don't.

323
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,720
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

324
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,000
Come on.

325
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,320
I gotta go.

326
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,240
Bye.

327
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,440
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.

328
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,520
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

329
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,840
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

330
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,600
Pretty tight, huh?

331
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,160
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

332
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,040
Cool car.

333
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,920
What's going on in there?

334
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,640
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

335
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,320
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

336
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Okay. Thanks.

337
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,360
Something's bothering him.
Maybe he's too embarrased to tell me what it is.

338
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,080
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

339
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,800
I don't know, I just don't know anymore.

340
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm going to the downtown library,
I'll see you later.

341
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,080
- Wait. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.

342
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,360
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go, go.

343
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,280
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Now wait a minute, we need to talk.

344
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,640
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

345
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,640
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

346
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,680
Because we haven't talked at all for so long,
your Aunt May and I don't even know who you are any more.

347
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,640
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

348
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,760
- You start fights at school.
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

349
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,800
- Well you sure as hell finished it.
- What was I supposed to do, run away?

350
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,880
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

351
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,400
But, Pete look, you're changing. I know,
I went through exactly the same thing at your age.

352
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,520
No. Not exactly.

353
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,440
Peter... these are the years
when a man changes...

354
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,440
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

355
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,560
Just be careful who you change into.

356
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,360
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

357
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,480
But just because you can
beat him up...

358
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,080
...doesn't give you the right to.

359
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,760
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

360
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Are you afraid that I'm going to turn into some
kind of criminal? Quit worrying about me, okay?

361
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,560
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing, please.

362
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,880
I don't mean to lecture and I don't mean to
preach. And I know I'm not your father--

363
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,760
Then stop pretending to be!

364
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,880
Right.

365
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,600
I'll pick you up here at 1 0.

366
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,040
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

367
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,480
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

368
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,120
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

369
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,160
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

370
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,560
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

371
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,640
Ladies and gentlemen...

372
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,160
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

373
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,640
For $3000...

374
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,280
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

375
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,960
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

376
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Who?

377
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,480
I know who.

378
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,280
The Flying Dutchman!

379
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,000
Next.

380
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,960
There's no featherweight
division here smallfry. Next.

381
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,880
No, no. Sign me up.

382
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,560
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

383
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,880
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain while participating in said event

384
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,960
and you are indeed participating of your own free will?
- Yes.

385
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,000
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

386
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,640
Told you! Told you!

387
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,560
Winner!

388
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,920
Next victim!

389
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,480
Are you ready for more?

390
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,000
Bone Saw is ready!

391
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,800
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

392
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,520
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

393
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,960
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

394
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,680
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

395
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,520
The Human Spider? That's it.
That's the best you got?

396
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,720
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

397
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,200
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

398
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,480
...the terrifying, the deadly...

399
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,800
...the amazing Spiderman!

400
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,600
- My Name's the Human Spider.
- I don't care, get out there.

401
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,680
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, you moron.

402
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,520
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.

403
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,720
I hope you brought your mommy.

404
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,960
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

405
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,400
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

406
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,840
Oh, my God!

407
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,600
Oh, my legs!

408
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,280
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

409
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,360
Kill! Kill! Kill!

410
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,720
Cage! Cage! Cage!

411
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,040
Cage!

412
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Hello? Guys?

413
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,160
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

414
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,960
Hey listen! This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

415
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,480
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

416
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,400
Hey, freak show!

417
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,120
You're going nowhere.

418
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,560
I got you for three minutes.

419
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,920
Three minutes of playtime.

420
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,600
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

421
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,680
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

422
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,600
Finish him off!

423
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,960
Smash him!

424
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,520
- Hit him!
- Harder!

425
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,680
Kick his spider ass!

426
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,720
Hit him!

427
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,320
One, two, three!

428
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,200
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

429
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,240
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spiderman!

430
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,520
Now get out of here.

431
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,800
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

432
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,280
Well, check it again, webhead.

433
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,160
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

434
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,600
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

435
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,080
I need that money.

436
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,480
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

437
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,440
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

438
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,480
Hurry up!

439
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Hey! He stole the gate!

440
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,600
Stop that guy!

441
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,320
Stop him! He's got my money!

442
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,720
Thanks.

443
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,200
What the hell's the matter with you,
you let him go!

444
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,520
Cut him off and call the cops!

445
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,560
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he's going to get away with my money.

446
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,960
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

447
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,880
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

448
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,920
Old dude, man.

449
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

450
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,000
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

451
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,360
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

452
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,600
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

453
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,200
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

454
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,720
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

455
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,240
Uncle Ben?

456
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,560
Uncle Ben.

457
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,440
Uncle Ben?

458
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,360
Peter.

459
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,920
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

460
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,480
Peter.

461
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,480
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

462
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,200
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

463
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
Get a unit to the rear!

464
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,120
I got the back!

465
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,800
Who's there?

466
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance.
Just give me a chance!

467
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,480
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

468
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,080
Answer me!

469
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,560
Stop that guy!

470
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,440
Thanks.

471
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,000
See you.

472
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,120
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.

473
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,440
Oh, no. My God.

474
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,800
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

475
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,640
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

476
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,160
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocum.

477
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,520
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

478
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,600
- He's clear! Go!
- I assume you're confident about this test.

479
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,960
Absolutely, Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

480
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,320
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

481
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,240
Nothing would please me more
than to put Norman Osborn out of business.

482
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,400
Preflight complete. Mark.

483
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,880
We are picking up an
unidentified object closing fast.

484
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,080
What the hell is that?

485
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,680
Can you see anything?

486
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,440
Oh, my God!

487
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,040
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

488
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,320
Peter!

489
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,880
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

490
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,400
Pete. Good news. My Father got the place in
New York so we're all set this Friday.

491
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,040
- Oh that's great!
- You made it.

492
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,880
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

493
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,320
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

494
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,200
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

495
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,840
Yeah.

496
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,920
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

497
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,200
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

498
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,880
Commencement:

499
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,000
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

500
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,280
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

501
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,920
You know what? Whatever.

502
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,840
Your loss.

503
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,920
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

504
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,760
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

505
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,240
Can I fix you something?

506
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,840
No, thanks.

507
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,880
I missed him a lot today.

508
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,800
I know.

509
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,240
I miss him too.

510
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,160
But he was there.

511
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,200
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

512
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,200
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

513
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,880
You loved him...

514
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,640
...and he loved you.

515
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,000
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

516
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,480
How you were meant for great things.

517
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,240
You won't disappoint him.

518
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,400
With great power
comes great responsibility.

519
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,640
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.

520
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,440
Hurry up!

521
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,920
This is not a man. My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center fountain.

522
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,160
They think he's human.
They think he's a man. Could be a woman.

523
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,720
Bobby. Get a load of this!

524
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,840
He throws up his hands, ropes come out, and
he climbs up the ropes like a spider web.

525
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,080
I see the web and it's a signature,
and I know Spiderman was here.

526
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,760
The guy protects us, you know
protects the people.

527
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,560
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wakadoo.

528
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,680
He stinks and I don't like him.

529
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,880
Don't move, lady!

530
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,280
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

531
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,520
Those tights and that tight little...

532
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,880
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug

533
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,680
But we should all just give him
One big hug

534
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,280
Look out
Here comes the Spiderman

535
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,400
"Who is Spiderman?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

536
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,200
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

537
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,720
Mr. Jameson your wife is on line one
she needs to know if--

538
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,680
- Mr. Jameson there's a page six problem.
-We have a page one problem, shut up.

539
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,480
- Well?
- He's news.

540
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,080
- These are really important clients they can't wait.
- They're about to.

541
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,080
- He pulled six people off that subway car.
- Sure from a wreck he probably caused.

542
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,240
Something goes wrong and this creepy-crawler is there.
Look at that, he's fleeing the scene.  What's that tell you?

543
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,200
He's not fleeing, he's probably going to
save somebody else. He's a hero!

544
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,040
Then why's he wear a mask, hmm?
What's he got to hide?

545
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,120
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille in the dining room.

546
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,640
- Whichever's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson it's like this,

547
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,480
We double-booked page six. See so both
Macy's and Conway's have three-quarters of the same page.

548
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,680
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

549
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,000
Every copy.

550
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,200
Tomorrow morning. Spiderman. Page one with a decent
picture this time. Move Conway to page seven.

551
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,160
- That's a problem.
- Make it page eight and give 'em 10 percent off.
No make it 5 percent.

552
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,920
- That can't be done.
- Get outta here!

553
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,760
Problem is we don't have a decent picture.
Eddie's been on it for weeks, we can barely get a glimpse of him.

554
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,960
Aw, what is he, shy?

555
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,960
We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong
we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo.

556
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,400
Put an ad on the front page.
"Cash money for a picture of Spiderman"

557
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,880
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

558
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,200
Buzz off.

559
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,720
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

560
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:12,040
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm begging for a job. How about you?

561
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,080
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting now?

562
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,240
Yeah.

563
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,160
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

564
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,440
That's great MJ.

565
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,080
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Hey counter girl!

566
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,800
Your drawer was short six dollars!

567
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,480
Next time that happens,
I'm gonna take it outta your cheque!

568
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,160
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

569
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,560
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

570
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,680
It better not happen no more, hear me?.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

571
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,000
Some dream, huh?

572
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,360
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

573
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,200
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

574
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,000
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

575
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,920
Oh, yeah. Right.

576
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,120
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

577
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,520
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

578
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:15,000
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

579
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,280
No, I guess not.

580
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,600
Thanks, Pete.

581
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,800
We should catch up sometime.

582
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,280
Let's get some lunch some evening.

583
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,800
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

584
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,600
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.

585
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,960
I won't.

586
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,720
I won't tell Harry.

587
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,920
Timing's perfect. Hey.

588
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,280
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

589
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,920
Stormin' Norman's making his weekly inspection.

590
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,840
Spent half of it on the phone.

591
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,920
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

592
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,960
Are you all right?

593
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,600
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

594
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,680
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

595
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,320
You were late again?

596
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:34,720
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

597
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,080
Around.

598
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,880
Peter Parker.

599
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,600
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?

600
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,720
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

601
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,680
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad!

602
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,000
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

603
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,880
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

604
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,800
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

605
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,120
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem.  I'll make a few calls.

606
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,400
I couldn't accept it. I'd like to earn
what I get. I can find my own work.

607
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,160
I respect that.

608
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,880
You want to make it on your own steam.

609
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,800
That's great.

610
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,880
What other skills do you have Parker?

611
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,120
I was thinking of something in photography.

612
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,160
Hello.

613
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,200
Let's go! Move it!

614
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,920
Watch the street!

615
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,040
Cheese!

616
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,840
They're crap.

617
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,880
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

618
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,120
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.

619
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,000
Take them somewhere else then.

620
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,320
- Sir your wife said that tile you want in the foyer is out of stock.
- Tell her we'll just put a rug there.

621
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,560
Sit down. Give me that.

622
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,520
I'll give you 300.
That's a standard freelance fee.

623
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,920
- Tear up page one. Run that photo instead.
- Headline?

624
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,280
"Spiderman, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."

625
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,920
- Menace? He was protecting that--
- Tell you what, Atticus you take the pictures

626
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,200
I'll make up the headlines, ok? all right?
That ok with you.

627
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,280
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

628
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,080
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

629
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,200
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

630
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,960
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.

631
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,280
Bring me some more shots of that newspaper selling clown,
maybe I'll take 'em off your hands.

632
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,320
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

633
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,080
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Best I can do. Get outta here.

634
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,560
Bring me more photos.

635
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,280
- Hi.
- Hi.

636
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,760
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

637
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,800
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.

638
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,640
I'm Peter Parker.

639
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,120
I'm a photographer.

640
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,320
Yes. I can see that.

641
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,480
As of today...

642
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,480
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

643
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,960
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

644
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,840
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

645
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,040
...costs are down, revenues are up...

646
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,000
...and our stock
has never been higher.

647
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,400
Wonderful news, Norman. Woderful.
In fact, it's the reason for selling the company.

648
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,400
What?

649
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:45,520
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing. Expanding.

650
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,400
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

651
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,680
Why wasn't I told?

652
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,760
The last thing they want is a power struggle
with entrenched management.

653
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,240
The deal is off if you come with it.

654
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,680
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

655
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,760
You can't do this to me.

656
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,000
I started this company.

657
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,320
You know how much I sacrificed?!

658
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,240
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

659
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,600
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

660
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,200
I'm sorry.

661
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,200
You're out, Norman.

662
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,120
Am I?

663
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,400
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.

664
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,800
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.

665
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,680
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

666
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,720
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

667
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,240
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

668
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,760
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

669
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,560
I think you're beautiful.

670
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,960
MJ would you do me a favour?
I forgot my drink inside.

671
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,800
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

672
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,800
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.

673
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,720
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

674
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,640
What is that?

675
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,640
That's our glider!

676
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,000
What the hell was that?

677
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:14,600
Code three! Code three!

678
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,040
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

679
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,080
Harry! Help me! Harry!

680
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,480
Out, am I?

681
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,920
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

682
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,640
Hello, my dear.

683
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,360
It's Spiderman!

684
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,280
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!

685
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,880
Somebody help him!

686
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:23,040
No!

687
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,480
Mommy!

688
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,280
- Hold it right there!
- I surrender.

689
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,240
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

690
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,000
Impressive.

691
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,600
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

692
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,920
Hold on!

693
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,480
Watch out!

694
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,880
We'll meet again, Spiderman!

695
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,800
Hold on Mary Jane!

696
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,080
Well, beats taking the subway.

697
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,400
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

698
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,640
Wait.

699
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,000
Who are you?

700
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,640
- You know who I am.
- I do?

701
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,360
Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.

702
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,320
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

703
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,960
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm going to come over.

704
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,200
No, I'm gonna come...

705
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,800
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

706
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,840
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

707
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,200
...I want to buy you something.

708
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,560
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

709
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,080
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

710
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,080
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

711
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,920
Don't let the bedbugs...

712
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,280
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

713
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,400
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

714
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,240
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

715
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,320
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

716
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:51,800
You're right.

717
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,120
I didn't.

718
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,280
I'm gonna get some rest.

719
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,640
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

720
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,360
What was that thing?

721
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,200
I don't know.

722
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,800
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

723
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,480
Somebody there?

724
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,240
Somebody.

725
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,840
Somebody.

726
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,600
Who said that?

727
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,440
Don't play the innocent with me.

728
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,360
You've known all along.

729
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,520
Where are you?

730
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,560
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

731
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,920
I'm right here.

732
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,520
I don't understand.

733
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,520
Did you think it was coincidence?

734
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,160
So many good things,
all happening for you.

735
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,840
All for you. Norman.

736
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,640
What do you want?

737
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,120
To say what you won't.

738
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,840
To do what you can't.

739
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,400
To remove those in your way.

740
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,080
The board members.

741
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,640
You killed them.

742
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,280
We killed them.

743
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,600
We?

744
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,280
Remember?

745
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,000
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

746
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,520
The performance enhancers.

747
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:53,760
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

748
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:57,600
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

749
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,520
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

750
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,080
And it's only the beginning.

751
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,680
There's only one who can stop us.

752
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,680
Or imagine if he joined us.

753
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,360
Spiderman. And the Green Goblin.

754
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,720
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

755
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,760
- These weirdo's all gotta have a name now.
- Mr. Jameson Spiderman...

756
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,520
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

757
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,280
Call the patent office, copyright the name Green Goblin,
I want a quarter every time somebody says it.

758
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,680
How about "Green Meanie"?

759
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,600
Spiderman wasn't attacking the city he was
trying to save it. That's slander.

760
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,000
It is not. I resent that.

761
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,880
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

762
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,640
You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.

763
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,760
I trust my barber.

764
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,000
What are you his lawyer? Get out of here!

765
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:54,760
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...

766
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,960
Jameson, you slime.

767
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,320
Who's the photographer who takes the
pictures of Spiderman?

768
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,320
- I don't know who he is.  His stuff comes in the mail.
- Liar!

769
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,360
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.

770
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,320
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

771
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,680
Set him down, tough guy.

772
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,320
- Speak of the devil.
- Spiderman! I knew you two were in this together.

773
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,000
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?.

774
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,560
Sleep...

775
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,280
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

776
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,680
No, you're not dead yet.

777
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,960
Just paralyzed...

778
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,000
...temporarily.

779
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,920
You're an amazing creature,
Spiderman.

780
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,680
You and I are not so different.

781
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,560
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

782
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,520
Well, to each his own.

783
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,520
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

784
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:17,600
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

785
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,920
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

786
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,560
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

787
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:29,080
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

788
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,280
Why bother?

789
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:35,000
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

790
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,280
There are eight million people
in this city.

791
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,600
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

792
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,600
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

793
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,120
You, me...

794
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,520
...we're exceptional.

795
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,240
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

796
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,960
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

797
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,560
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

798
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,400
What we could create.

799
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,880
Or we could destroy.

800
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,840
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

801
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,720
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

802
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,400
Think about it, hero.

803
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,000
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

804
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,320
It's me again.

805
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,040
How was your audition?

806
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,120
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...

807
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,160
...told my aunt, told me.

808
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,880
So you just came by?

809
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,560
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

810
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:06,120
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

811
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,800
So how'd it go?

812
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,360
They said I needed acting lessons.

813
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:16,120
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

814
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:21,400
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

815
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,680
I'd like a cheeseburger.

816
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,440
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

817
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,200
Come with us.

818
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:33,000
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

819
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,240
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

820
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,160
It's not?

821
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,120
Why so interested?

822
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,200
I'm not.

823
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,760
You're not?

824
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,960
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

825
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,920
Why would you be?

826
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,960
I, that's a...

827
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,600
I don't know.

828
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,440
Sorry you won't come with us.

829
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,680
I'd better run, tiger.

830
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,960
Hey, check it out, man.

831
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,720
Come on, man.

832
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,240
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

833
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,800
Get off me!

834
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,160
Wait!

835
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,080
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

836
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,440
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

837
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,440
I was in the neighborhood.

838
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,760
You are amazing.

839
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,280
Some people don't think so.

840
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:42,200
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

841
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,000
Do I get to say thank you this time?

842
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,280
Wait.

843
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,480
I have to get in there! My baby's in there!
My baby's in there!

844
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,680
- Let me go!
- I can't let you in there, the roof's about to collapse.

845
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,200
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

846
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,680
Look! Up there!

847
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,760
Save my baby, please!

848
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,600
No!

849
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,880
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

850
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,680
God bless you, Spiderman.
Bless you.

851
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,560
Don't let him get away!

852
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,880
Hold it right there! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

853
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,240
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

854
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,920
I'm going.

855
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,440
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back chief.

856
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,920
Go! Go!

857
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,120
Where are you?

858
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,600
Where are you?

859
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,040
I'm gonna get you out of here!

860
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,960
It's okay.

861
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,200
You're pathetically predictable.

862
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,200
Like a moth to the flame.

863
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,400
What about my generous proposal?

864
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,120
Are you in or are you out?

865
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:57,000
- It's you who's out Gobby. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.

866
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,840
Oh, great.

867
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,600
No one says no to me!

868
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,920
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

869
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,520
He's here.

870
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,720
Are you ready?

871
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,040
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

872
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:02,200
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

873
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,680
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

874
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,520
Who is this lovely young lady?

875
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,800
I'd like you to meet my father Norman Osborn.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

876
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,560
How do you do?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

877
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,320
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

878
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,760
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

879
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,720
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

880
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,040
Peter?

881
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,400
Is that you?

882
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:53,640
How strange. There's nobody here.

883
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,120
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

884
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,920
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

885
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,760
Sorry I'm late.
It's a jungle out there.

886
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,680
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

887
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,840
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

888
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,520
...and we can say grace.

889
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,600
Here we go.

890
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,520
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

891
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,360
Will you do the honors?

892
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,680
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

893
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:30,520
Oh, yeah, I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

894
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,160
Well, let me see.

895
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:33,800
Oh, my goodness.

896
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,360
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

897
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,520
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

898
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:44,800
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving in this apartment
and we are going to do things properly.

899
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,680
How did you say that happened?

900
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,720
Bike messenger.

901
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,800
Knocked me down.

902
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,480
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.
- Why?

903
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,600
Something has come to my attention.

904
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,000
Are you all right?

905
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,560
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

906
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,440
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!

907
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,520
Dad, what are you doing?

908
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,560
I plan this whole thing so you can meet MJ
and now you've got to leave?

909
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,960
I've got to go.

910
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,240
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

911
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,240
Do you think a woman like that is sniffing
around because she likes your personality?

912
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,360
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.

913
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,720
They're all beautiful until they're snarling after
your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

914
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,120
You're wrong about her Dad.

915
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,720
A word to the not so wise about your little girlfriend,

916
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,600
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

917
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,000
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

918
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,040
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

919
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,960
That creep is my father, all right
If I'm lucky I'll become half of what he is

920
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,440
so just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand.

921
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,200
Harry Osborn!

922
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,200
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

923
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,240
Spiderman is all but invincible.

924
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,400
But Parker, we can destroy him.

925
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,880
I can't.

926
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,920
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

927
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,320
Parker must be educated.

928
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,640
What do I do?

929
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,760
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

930
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,840
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

931
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,320
Yes?

932
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,320
And then grant his wish.

933
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,440
But how?

934
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,760
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

935
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,080
Tell me how!

936
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,320
The heart, Osborn.

937
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,480
First, we attack his heart.

938
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,640
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

939
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,680
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

940
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,600
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

941
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,480
Deliver us!

942
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,000
Finish it!

943
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,040
- Finish it!
- From evil!

944
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,600
Two milligrams IV.

945
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,520
Get the BP.

946
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,560
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

947
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,440
Yes she's going to be ok.
Look you're going to have to leave right now.

948
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,640
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

949
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,720
Those horrible yellow eyes!

950
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,800
He knows who I am.

951
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,480
I'm sorry.

952
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,400
- Will she be okay?
- She's going to be fine.

953
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,120
She's been sleeping all day.

954
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,720
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

955
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,520
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

956
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:59,240
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

957
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,280
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

958
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,800
I haven't called him back.

959
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,440
The fact is...

960
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:12,280
...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

961
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,560
At least I think I am.

962
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:19,080
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.

963
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:22,360
Would I know his name, this guy?

964
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,320
You'll think I'm a stupid little
girl with a crush.

965
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,800
Trust me.

966
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,240
It's funny.

967
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:33,960
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

968
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,360
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

969
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,400
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

970
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,720
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say about him?

971
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,680
No, no, not Spiderman,
not a chance in the world.

972
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,440
I know him a little bit.

973
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,400
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

974
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,600
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

975
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,320
What'd he say?

976
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,160
I said...

977
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:04,320
He asked me what I thought about you.

978
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,160
And what did you say?

979
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,760
I said, "Spiderman."

980
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:16,760
I said, "The great thing about M. J...

981
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,440
...is...

982
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:22,440
...when you look in her eyes...

983
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,960
...and she's looking back in yours...

984
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,800
...everything feels...

985
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,720
...not quite normal.

986
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,640
Because you feel...

987
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,720
...stronger...

988
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,680
...and weaker at the same time.

989
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,720
You feel excited...

990
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,520
...and at the same time...

991
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,680
...terrified.

992
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,040
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

993
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,880
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

994
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,280
It's as if you've...

995
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,920
...reached the unreachable...

996
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:16,040
...and you weren't ready for it."

997
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,040
You said that?

998
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,040
Well, something like that.

999
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:07,960
Dad?

1000
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,080
Dad, is that you?

1001
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,840
What is it?

1002
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,800
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1003
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,360
She's in love with Peter.

1004
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,360
- Parker?
- Yeah.

1005
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,520
And how does he feel about her?

1006
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,320
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1007
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:48,280
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1008
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,760
I'm so sorry.

1009
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,440
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

1010
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,200
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1011
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,120
That's no excuse.

1012
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,800
I'm proud of you.

1013
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:13,000
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you, Harry.

1014
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,280
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1015
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,560
Wake up, little spider.

1016
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:33,160
Wake up.

1017
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,960
Go home, dear.

1018
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,440
You look awful.

1019
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,840
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1020
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,200
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

1021
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,960
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1022
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:51,440
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1023
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,840
A smile. Finally.

1024
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,160
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1025
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,520
Hey, you were supposed to be asleep.

1026
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,880
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J. 's family moved in next door.

1027
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,920
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1028
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:16,120
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, aunt May, is that an angel?"

1029
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,720
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1030
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,920
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1031
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,720
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1032
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:33,320
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1033
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,520
You're so mysterious all the time.

1034
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,400
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1035
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,400
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1036
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,160
Everybody else knows.

1037
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,200
I'll be right back.

1038
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,120
But...

1039
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,080
Come on, pick up.

1040
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:04,400
- Hey M.J.
-Hi. Sing your song at the beep.

1041
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,360
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1042
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,360
Hello? You there?

1043
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,160
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1044
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,680
All right, well...

1045
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,080
Don't...

1046
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,960
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1047
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,600
Hello?

1048
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:28,480
Can Spiderman come out to play?

1049
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,360
Where is she?

1050
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,320
- What is that?
- That's cool!

1051
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:20,960
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout

1052
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:25,120
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out

1053
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:42,920
Goblin, what have you done?

1054
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:27,360
Spiderman!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1055
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:29,320
Because you never know...

1056
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:34,040
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1057
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,640
Let die the woman you love...

1058
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,640
...or suffer the little children.

1059
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,320
- Spiderman!
- Save us!

1060
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,000
Save us!

1061
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,760
Make your choice, Spiderman...

1062
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,200
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1063
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,360
Don't do it, Goblin!

1064
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,320
We are who we choose to be.

1065
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,200
- Now, choose!
- No!

1066
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,240
Everybody stay still!

1067
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,600
Ahoy up there!

1068
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,600
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1069
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:01,760
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1070
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,360
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1071
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:11,160
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1072
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,840
Trust me.

1073
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:17,960
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1074
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,080
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1075
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,880
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1076
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,680
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1077
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,240
It's time to die.

1078
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,640
Come on up here dumb gu
I got a little something for ya.

1079
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,080
Leave Spiderman alone.
You gonna pick on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?

1080
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:26,080
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1081
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:29,640
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1082
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,360
Spiderman, watch out!

1083
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,000
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1084
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,400
I offered you friendship...

1085
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,360
...and you spat in my face.

1086
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:15,880
You've spun your last web, Spiderman.

1087
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:19,240
Had you not been so selfish, your little
girlfriend's death

1088
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:21,000
...would have been quick and painless.

1089
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:24,440
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1090
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:29,360
...l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1091
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,720
M.J. and I...

1092
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,680
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1093
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,760
Peter, stop!

1094
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,280
Stop! It's me.

1095
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:45,320
Mr. Osborn.

1096
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,960
Peter, thank God for you.

1097
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:49,400
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1098
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:52,480
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1099
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,320
Don't let him take me again.

1100
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,440
I beg you. Protect me.

1101
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:00,040
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1102
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,640
But not you.

1103
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:06,080
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1104
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:08,280
I would never hurt you.

1105
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,320
I knew from the beginning...

1106
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,320
...if anything ever happened to me...

1107
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,520
...it was you that I could count on.

1108
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,920
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1109
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:21,240
Thank God for you.

1110
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,560
Give me your hand.

1111
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,960
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1112
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:32,000
I've been like a father to you.

1113
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,080
Be a son to me now.

1114
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,600
I have a father.

1115
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:41,720
His name was Ben Parker.

1116
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,920
Godspeed, Spiderman.

1117
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,520
Peter.

1118
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,520
Don't tell Harry.

1119
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,560
What have you done?

1120
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,240
What have you done?!

1121
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:11,200
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1122
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:15,080
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1123
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:20,320
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1124
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,040
One day Spiderman will pay.

1125
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:28,840
I swear on my father's grave,
Spiderman will pay.

1126
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,400
Thank God for you, Peter.

1127
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,440
You're the only family I have.

1128
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:04,160
No matter what I do...

1129
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:07,320
... no matter how hard I try...

1130
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:11,560
... the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.

1131
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,080
You must miss him so much.

1132
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,920
It's been so hard without him.

1133
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,480
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1134
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,920
When I was up there...

1135
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:40,320
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1136
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,560
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1137
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,880
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1138
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,600
It was you, Pete.

1139
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,240
I kept thinking:

1140
01:47:56,640 --> 01:47:59,320
"I hope I make it through this...

1141
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:04,920
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1142
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,680
Really?

1143
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:13,600
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1144
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,680
...who makes me feel...

1145
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:20,680
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1146
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,320
That I'm just...

1147
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,400
...me.

1148
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,280
And that's okay.

1149
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,800
The truth is...

1150
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,560
...I love you.

1151
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,440
I love you so much, Peter.

1152
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:04,880
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.

1153
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:06,880
I can't...

1154
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,400
You can't what?

1155
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,880
Tell you...

1156
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:18,680
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1157
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:23,480
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1158
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,240
I want you to know...

1159
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,200
...that I will always be there
for you.

1160
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:33,200
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1161
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,080
I promise you that.

1162
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:41,440
I will always be your friend.

1163
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,040
Only a friend...

1164
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,360
...Peter Parker?

1165
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,160
That's all I have to give.

1166
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:21,000
Whatever life holds in store for me...

1167
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,440
I will never forget these words,

1168
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:28,960
"With great power
comes great responsibility. "

1169
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,280
This is my gift.

1170
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,480
My curse.

1171
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,800
Who am I?

1172
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,480
I'm Spiderman.

1173
01:50:38,305 --> 01:50:44,551
